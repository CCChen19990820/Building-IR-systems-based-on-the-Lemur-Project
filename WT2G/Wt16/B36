The Pot War In England
<P>

NEW YORK, DECEMBER 8
<P>
<P>A friend abroad writes to ask whether the U.S. press has picked up on the November 11 editorial in The Lancet entitled ``Deglamorising cannabis.'' The answer is: No, not as far as I am aware. And indeed no-news here is very strange news because The Lancet is the pre-eminent medical publication in Britain, something like the New England Journal of Medicine. And the extraordinary last line of the editorial reads, ``Cannabis per se is not a hazard to society but driving it further underground may well be.'' 
<P>Inquiry into the story reveals that a Labour MP, Clare Short, proposed in the House of Commons recently that pot be legalized. As would have been the case if she had made the same proposal in Congress, Miss Short was all but run out of town.
<P>But one has to suppose that some of the data she cited seeped through to the British consciousness. Begin with the poll in Glasgow. It documents a quite astonishing story, namely that one-half of all students between the ages of 14 and 25 admit to smoking pot ``every day.'' Miss Short then went on to cite the experience of cannabis use in the Netherlands and in doing so bumped into another story.
<P>It is this, that for twenty years the authorities in Amsterdam have simply ignored the use of pot, which is regularly sold in four thousand coffee shops in amounts up to 30 grams per customer. Technically, the use of the drug, let alone the sale of it, is illegal, and during its most recent campaign the governing party pledged to rectify this hypocrisy and was all set to do that when it was reminded by its neighbors of something called the Schengen agreement, which introduced the border-free zone between the Netherlands, France, Germany, Spain, Luxembourg, and Belgium. France threatened to annul the agreement because cannabis was flowing merrily into a country in which no drug is permitted to compete with alcohol. The Dutch have said that they must therefore crack down on pot, which would mean closing half the coffee houses, not a popular idea. 
<P>But The Lancet, reviewing the controversy kicked up by Miss Short, asks the Home Office to consider the implications of the rise in marijuana use in Great Britain. Notwithstanding its laws, consumption of pot has doubled in ten years. And The Lancet goes on, ``Perhaps the politicians' real fear was that freedom to use soft drugs would automatically progress to increased use of substances such as cocaine and heroin. If so, they must have overlooked the recent Dutch government review which pointed out that decriminalization of possession of soft drugs had not led to a rise in the use of hard drugs.'' 
<P>Even so, the government struggles on. Last year Home Secretary Michael Howard increased the maximum fine for possession of the drug from $750 to $3,750, which is rough stuff but not, of course, to be compared with going to jail for a year or ten, as we do things here. There it ``depends where you get caught,'' writes drug-reformer Mike Goodman. ``There are parts of Wales and various rural areas where you'll certainly go to court for possessing cannabis and get a fairly stiff fine. In other areas, such as London, you'd be unlikely even to get a caution.'' In London, what you usually get is ``informal disposal'' -- which means the police throw the confiscated drugs down the drain.
<P>The evidence pours in. Another Home Office survey, this time of 25-year-olds, reveals that eight out of ten men and women have taken illegal drugs and that the biggest consumers were not schoolchildren but young white males from the professional and middle classes. At the other end of the empire we read that a businessman in Vancouver is quite openly engaged in distributing cannabis seeds all over the world, is paying his taxes, and the government of British Columbia is perfectly happy to accept the wages of sin, keeping his tax money and ignoring his illegal activity. ``If the drug ever does become legal in Britain,'' writes a correspondent of The Herald (Glasgow), ``it will be because of the sheer weight of such statistics, which indicate a threefold increase in the use of pot since 1989.'' 
<P>What is striking isn't so much the difference between what is legal and what people do, as the quite calm acceptance by the medical community of the relative harmlessness of cannabis, though the point is regularly made that if the weed were legalized, its quality could be superintended. And attention continues, however gradually, to focus on the paradox. Although ``no exact figures are available,'' says the dispatch from The Herald, ``it is known the Government is spending about twice as much on policing and prosecuting drug offenders as it does on education, prevention, and rehabilitation.'' That strikes some people, including your servant, as dumb.

<head><title>The Week -- NR</title></head>

<center>
<h2>The Week</h2>
<hr></center>
<P>


<p>
<li>
TV stations in New Hampshire and Iowa have started to get complaints that they keep
interrupting the Steve Forbes commercials to show programming.
<p>
<li>

All signs are that the obstructionists among President Clinton's advisors have the upper hand in
the internal debate over the budget. The idea is to stonewall the GOP's huge budget-reconciliation
bill, then pick it apart next year, making each element one plank in a scare campaign: the farm bill
in the Midwest; the Medicare reforms in Arizona, Florida, and just about everywhere else; etc.
(Think of it as their version of the Contract with America.) Republicans, meanwhile, would be
denied both any significant legislative accomplishment this year and any chance to rebut
Democratic distortions by pointing to the non-apocalyptic reality of their policies. So, it's
imperative that the GOP avoid this gridlock scenario. The chief means of doing so is by holding
the outstanding appropriations bills hostage and threatening another government shutdown come
December 15. Nervous senators -- Bob Dole is calling a second partial shutdown a ``mistake'' --
are beginning to shy away from this approach, chastened by the fallout from the mid-November
shutdown. Which obviously could have been handled better (may Newt Gingrich never exit from
the front door of a plane again). But, even so, once the November shutdown became focused on a
seven-year balanced budget, the White House's nightly tracking polls crashed and congressional
Democrats began to peel off. Clinton has no stomach for doing publicly what he wants in his
heart: to keep the red ink flowing. In the coming weeks, then, Republicans must drag him out in
the open, be flexible on the spending details (giving a little on Americorps, Medicare, and so on),
but refuse to accept ``no'' for an answer. Actually achieving a balanced budget is indispensable
political cover. As in 1990, when the Bush Administration headed for Andrews Air Force base,
the Republican future hangs in the balance. Blink -- and you're dead.


<p><li>
Whatever President Clinton's rhetoric about ``mending'' affirmative action, his Administration's
real commitment is to expanding it. One of the most telling pieces of evidence has been its
conduct in a Piscataway, New Jersey, case involving the use of race as a factor in employment
decisions. The Justice Department had sided with a fired white teacher, Sharon Taxman, during
the Bush Administration. But soon after Deval Patrick became chief of its Civil Rights Division in
1994, the department switched sides -- in the middle of an appeal. This astonishing breach of legal
ethics proved too much for a three-judge panel, by no means composed of conservatives, which
threw the Justice Department out of court late last month. Yet the theoretical revolution here is
even more sinister: for the first time, a branch of the Federal Government is advocating racial
discrimination not to remedy past discrimination, but to promote ``diversity.'' Which is perilously
close to advocating racial discrimination -- the ``right'' kind, of course -- for its own sake. So far,
no court has accepted this rationale for racial preferences. But the President has at least another
year to make judicial appointments. To squelch the social revolution Mr. Patrick desires, voters
will have to throw him out of office as well as out of court.


<p><li>
President Clinton says his Bosnia policy comes with a one-year guarantee. But would you buy a
used civil war from this man?
<p><li>


The ``energy crisis'' that the federal 55-mile-per-hour speed limit was meant to alleviate ended
long ago. Since liberals cannot bear to see any regulation die, they opposed repeal anyway,
warning of carnage on the roads. (If ``saving lives'' were a dispositive argument for the current
speed limit, it would be an even better argument for lowering it to 45 mph.) Now that President
Clinton has grudgingly signed the bill, drivers will still be able to reap most of the safety
advantages of the old laws by driving slowly if they wish to. The added danger from others'
driving faster is too negligible to be taken seriously. If liberals were really concerned about
highway fatalities, they would urge consumers to buy bigger cars -- currently discouraged by
government fuel-efficiency standards.


<p><li>
The U.S. Postal Service has decided what to do about terrible customer-satisfaction ratings. It
will no longer publish them.

<p>
<li>
Poof! In a keystroke Robert Rubin turned the Civil Service retirement fund into old-fashioned
IOUs. Since the latter are not subject to the debt limit, D-Day (as in default) was pushed back
until December 28. We don't recommend the practice. Not only are further trust-fund raids illegal
(Rubin's own lawyers attest to this), but they would increase future federal liabilities, thereby
making a balanced budget that much more difficult. There's a better way. Why not sell all those
assets that the government has no business holding under any fiscal situation? Mortgages and
other loans held by Uncle Sam are worth $203 billion, according to the budget. Government lands
with their mineral rights are worth $577 billion; even environmentalists acknowledge their
despoliation under Washington's management. Selling off gold, foreign exchange, and other assets
held by the Treasury and Federal Reserve would raise about $205 billion, and move us toward the
privatized money supply long advocated by libertarians. Liquidating all non-defense assets could
keep the government afloat for five and a half years, according to the Joint Economic Committee.
Unfortunately, it would take years just to plan such a sell-off. Maybe in the Gingrich
Administration . . .


<p><li>
President Clinton ventured a new core belief that ``Bosnia lies at the very heart of Europe.''
Publishers of maps, atlases, gazetteers, geography texts, and derivative material, kindly make the
necessary revisions.


<p><li>
Peter Rodman's revelation (p. 23) of secret Clinton assurances to Yeltsin that NATO expansion
would be delayed indefinitely was given wide advance circulation by NR among Capitol Hill
denizens, diplomats, and journalists. George Will asked Warren Christopher about it on the
December 3 Brinkley show -- only to be told it was ``absolute nonsense.'' Mr. Christopher denied
any such ``arrangement'' and promised that the NATO Allies were ``on a steady course'' on the
enlargement issue. The term ``arrangement'' was of course a straw man, and the NATO Allies are
in fact on a ``steady course'' to nowhere: the only schedule they have is a schedule of infinite
evasions. Mr. Rodman's sources are authoritative witnesses, on both the Russian and the
American side, to the summit conversation at Hyde Park and also to lower-level exchanges. The
Secretary's stonewall is unbecoming. Speaker Gingrich is including a query about the matter in a
formal letter to the President. We expect a more judicious -- and candid -- reply.
n To you skeptics, we say: A nation that can bring lasting peace to Somalia can bring lasting
peace to Bosnia.

<p><li>

Javier Solana, Spain's foreign minister, has been chosen as NATO's new secretary general to
replace the departed and discredited Willy Claes. Solana, however, is a Socialist who opposed
Spain's entry into the Alliance in the early 1980s, who has no experience in security matters, and
who represents a country that is not a member of NATO's integrated military command. Six GOP
senators, led by Bob Dole and Jesse Helms, have rightly protested the choice. But the
Administration, having clung to Claes well past his sell-by date, and having vetoed the staunchly
pro-American Ruud Lubbers (apparently he wasn't sound on Bosnia), was finally satisfied with
Solana. He's Clinton's kind of guy.


<p><li>
The White House spin is that we are sending ``peacekeepers'' to Bosnia. Presumably that means
that the army, navy, and air force will get to stay home. We'll see. We never quite trust the White
House in these matters.

<p>
<li>
A poll conducted by Frank Luntz uncovers some interesting moral differences between liberals
and conservatives. More liberals ``admit to having taken a hotel towel'' (46 to 37 per cent). They
are less likely to fly a flag outside their home, but far more likely to sleep around, and more likely
to be convinced (61 per cent, to 57 for conservatives) that they are better than their fellow man.
Since all these self-estimates but the last are true, they also rate high in honesty.


<p><li>
Over the past twenty years, the CIA and the DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency) have spent $20
million on psychics, asking them to look into issues of national concern, and we still don't know
what the President's core beliefs are.

<p>
Dear Rusty
<p>
<br>What can I say? We're on a roll!
<br>Peace in Bosnia! Can you believe it? I had a little trouble with the complexities of the
agreement, to be honest. I gave Dick Holbrooke a buzz and said, ``Hey, Dick, when you get a
sec, I'd like to have a quick debrief on the peace talks.''
<br>``Absolutely, Mr. Vice President,'' he said. ``How's mid-morning coffee on February 11th
strike you?''
<br>``Um, to be honest, Dick, I was hoping for something sooner.''
<br>``Sooner?''
<br>``As in today, tomorrow, that sort of thing.''
<br>``Can I be totally honest with you, Mr. Vice President? Personally, I would love to sit down
and chew over the peace plan with you. But my schedule is an absolute bear. I mean, I've got a
profile slash interview thing to sit for -- it'll be in either the Times or the Sunday magazine, we're
still going back and forth on that. Then Walter Isaacson's got some nutty idea about 'Man of the
Year' stuff, silly, I know, but there it is. Then I've got my book to do -- ''
<br>``You've got a book, too?'' I asked. I'm always interested in talking to other authors.
<br>``A couple, actually. I'm almost done with my memoirs, The Peacemaker Finds His Stillness,
then I've got a kind of monograph coming out next year, America in 2000: The Holbrooke
Envisioning -- so as you can see, if I could squeeze you in I'd do it but I just can't.''
<br>``Well,'' I said, ``if you can't, you can't.''
<br>``How about a quick nutshell? It'll have to do because I've got Gail Sheehy here and I'm in
the middle of explaining to her why she's nuts to think that I should be Secretary of State --
though let's be honest, Chris is looking tired and old and rode-hard-and-put-away-wet, and he's
seventy years old, and do we need new blood at State? Darn right we do! -- but it's not like I have
the time, you know?''
<br>``It doesn't sound like it.''
<br>``But could my arm be twisted? Could I be persuaded? I can answer that in the affirmative.''
<br>``Ummm . . .'' I mumbled. I was beginning to get confused. 
<br>``Okay. Bosnia in a nutshell. Got a pencil?''
I grabbed a pencil and a sheet of paper.
<br>``Okay. The situation before Dayton: the Serbs, Milosevic of the Serbian Republic, and
Karadzic and Mladic of the Bosnian Serbs -- ''
<br>``You just lost me,'' I said.
<br>``Let me put it very, very simply: We were in Dayton for three weeks. The first two and half,
we mostly bickered, while the various delegations gorged on Domino's and freaked out over the
high-quality toilet paper we've got in America. Then, in the final days, we brokered a deal.''
<br>``Which was?''
<br>``Well, I thought to myself, 'Okay, pretend you're a Serb leader. You've been killing and
maiming and raping for 44 months, waging a campaign of massacre and genocide, perpetrating
some of the most unspeakable acts of violence and inhumanity since the Third Reich, for what?'
And I answered myself, 'For more land, for more territory.'''
<br>``Once you found out that Serb aggression and their various war crimes were designed to
increase their territory, what did you do?''
<br>``What do you think we did? We gave it to them! C'mon, Mr. Vice President, meet me
halfway here!''
<br>``So the Serbs get away with it? They get what they want? No punishment for their crimes?''
<br>``Hey, I don't know what you call 21 days in a Marriott Suites in Dayton, Ohio, but I sure as
heck don't call it nothing!''
This didn't sound so good to me. ``But aren't we just, I don't know, appeasing them?''
<br>``Mr. Vice President, this is what they taught me at the Kennedy School. What can I tell
you?''
<br>``Well, I guess then it's okay,'' I said.
<br>``Can I go now?'' he asked. ``I've got to call the Times and the Post and issue a strongly
worded statement in support of Warren Christopher, denying that I have any interest at all in the
office of Secretary of State.''
<br>``I do have one quick question. What about Haiti? The word is President Aristide wants
another term in office.''
<br>``Let him have it. You want a second term. So does he.''
<br>``Good point,'' I said. It was, too.
<br>``And bear in mind, Mr. Vice President,'' he said, ``that if you're successful in 1996, Warren
Christopher will be almost eighty years old. And the world, Mr. Vice President, the world is
young. And now I really have to go.''
And he hung up. He's an amazing guy, Rusty. I can't wait 'til he turns his attention to China!

The Hot Plotters
<p>
NEW YORK, NOVEMBER 28
<p>

The search for a greater choice of presidential candidates can't reach more desperate lengths than
the situation reported over the weekend, namely that a Hot Plot has been hatching by means of
telephone conference calls. Of the seven players who participated in these calls, reported to have
lasted two hours each, three are relatively unknown, the others being Bill Bradley, Gary Hart,
Paul Tsongas, and Lowell Weicker.
<p>Time magazine reports that in their last telephone conference, it couldn't be settled which of
the plotters should enter his name in the formal contest. About Senator Bradley there is this
problem, namely that he would put his audience to sleep if he recited King Harry's speech to his
soldiers at Agincourt. Mr. Bradley was recently in California testing the waters. He found them
uniformly cold, if that is the right word for waters that react not at all to the finger stuck in them
seeking Delphic encouragement. 
<p>Gary Hart, of course, has troubles that date back to his hubristic outing on the yacht Monkey
Business, the design of which caper has to have been to prove that the American voters don't care
any more about adultery than they are supposed to care about abortion. To be sure, Senator Hart,
unlike most of the others on the party line last Sunday, is a charismatic political campaigner. But
when the opportunity came up earlier in the year to run for the Senate from his home state,
Colorado, he decided to pass it up. If you can't count on your home state for senator, it doesn't
make much sense to go for 26 states.
<p>Paul Tsongas is an attractive former senator who fired off a Roman candle or two during the
Democratic primaries in 1992 by calling for a reduced federal deficit. He ran into the usual
problem, which is that most voters are a) in favor of a balanced budget, and b) in favor of
everything that causes the budget to be unbalanced. In any event, Mr. Tsongas has medical
problems which are said to have caused him to rule himself out as the candidate of the Hot
Plotters.
<p>Lowell Weicker did succeed when he ran as an independent for governor of Connecticut,
soon after his defeat for re-election as senator at the hands of Joseph Lieberman. Governor
Weicker's reign calls to mind the blurb written by Evelyn Waugh for his friend Nancy Mitford's
novel. ``In 1945,'' Mr. Waugh wrote, ``Miss Mitford voted the socialist ticket. Having done her
best to make England uninhabitable, she went to France to live.'' It was Mr. Weicker who
instituted the income tax in Connecticut, which has served no purpose other than to make the
state less genial than it once was to middle-class residents and to corporations, many of which
have fled. There is this additional problem, which is that Mr. Weicker is the most obnoxious
moralist since Savonarola, suggesting that any deviation from whatever was his most recent
political epiphany marks the dissenter as a cretin. 
<p>So where do we go from here? As regards Bradley - Hart - Tsongas - Weicker, the answer is:
absolutely nowhere. What their putative coalition is meant to say is that there is (their word) a
``huge'' hunger for the kind of politics they represent. How does one reduce this agenda into
idiomatic political language? Well, the easiest way to put it is that they are anti-Newt.
<p>The Speaker has been having a rough time of it in recent days, and some of it is his fault. It
isn't a fault you'd score against a philosopher, who happily comes up with reticulate bearings to
help to understand any phenomenon. Years ago, wondering about some political quandary, I
asked a distinguished historian to trace the cause of the problem and he replied unhesitantly,
``William of Occam.'' He meant by this the introduction of relativist thought engendered by the
denial of universals in the fourteenth century.
<p>Okay, but of course Mr. Gingrich is supposed to speak in an idiomatic mode, and when
someone calls to his attention a quite awful specimen of human depravity, it is not wise, let alone
prudent, for him to cite federal welfare as the progenitive cause, even if, in a seminar, a professor
might persuasively track depravity back to welfare, back to original sin. But of course the trouble
with an etiological search so comprehensively concerned to identify the prime cause of human
misbehavior is that it could finger Newt Gingrich as suffering from the sin of intellectual pride.
But the surviving point has got to be that the courage and the stamina of the Speaker have given
the voters a vision of something truly distinctive from such an awful stew as one gets from the
Hot Plotters, who don't even have an interesting idiosyncrasy to call attention to them.

<CENTER><H2>Yalta in the Balkans</H2></CENTER>
<HR>

<p>
by Peter W. Rodman
<p>

WASHINGTON, D.C.
<p>
	One of the better arguments for the Dayton Accords and the dispatching of U.S. troops to Bosnia was that putting the Bosnian conflict on ice would serve larger American strategic interests.  One such interest was the future of the Western alliance: the prolongation of the Bosnia war and the squabbles among the Allies were poisonous to the Alliance itself, and the resulting incoherence of Western policy was poisonous to NATO's credibility.  A second key strategic interest was the enlargement of NATO into Central Europe, and prolongation of the Bosnia war was also complicating this.  (During the climactic NATO bombing operations in September, Boris Yeltsin gave a tempestuous news conference in which he conflated the two issues, blustering that an enlarged NATO would soon be dropping bombs on Russia's doorstep.)  The Dayton Accords offer us a chance, in other words, to put all this behind us and to re-focus our European policy on our larger concerns.
<p>
	These arguments for Dayton still hold, but NATIONAL REVIEW has learned of a stunningly duplicitous turn in the Clinton Administration's policy toward Russia, Bosnia, and the Atlantic Alliance:  The President and his associates are reported to have given Moscow secret assurances that, in return for its cooperation with the U.S. in Bosnia peacekeeping, NATO enlargement will be put "on the back burner" for the foreseeable future.  The rationale was that, given this demonstration of Russia's readiness to be a partner in a new cooperative "European security architecture," the extension of NATO security guarantees to Central Europe would not be a priority any time soon.  This account comes from official and authoritative sources, both Russian and American.
<p>
	It has long been understood (indeed, admitted by some Administration officials) that concrete decisions on admitting new NATO members would be put off until after the Russian elections, especially the presidential election scheduled for June 1996--which meant, as a practical matter, until after the U.S. presidential election as well.  Russian officials interpret the new assurances to mean that if Mr. Clinton is re-elected, nothing will happen on NATO enlargement in his second term either.
<p>
	The story is accompanied by reports of other assurances to the Russians that their cooperation on Bosnia would put the United States in their debt and earn them greater American understanding on other issues, such as their reassertion of control in their "near abroad" (Central Asia and the Caucasus, including the oil-rich Caspian basin).
<p>
	As usual, this Administration has its strategic priorities totally bass-ackwards.  It is wrong to pay a price to Russia over Bosnia in the strategic coin of our larger interest in consolidating security in Central Europe.  It is wrong to sacrifice NATO enlargement to the Russians over Bosnia or over anything else.  The Administration's repeated assurances to Congress and to the Allies that Russia would not have a veto over NATO enlargement turn out to be empty--perhaps just another of the "terminological inexactitudes" that have become so familiar.  A huge price will ultimately be paid for this.
<p>
	There is no current threat to Central Europe.  The newly liberated states of the region, however, have just recently awakened from a 60-year nightmare, still find themselves situated between Germany and Russia, and know in their bones that their survival is not guaranteed by history.  They consider themselves part of the West culturally, politically, and morally; they therefore seek Western assurances that we feel a stake in their security and independence.  Seen in this light, NATO enlargement is not a new act, but a consolidation of the post-1989 status quo: the are free, sovereign countries exercising their free, sovereign choice to associate with us.  Either Russia accepts this, or it does not.
<p>
	Leaving the security status of Central Europe ambiguous only leaves open temptations to Russian irredentists.  NATO membership for Central Europe is among other things a way of telling the Russians that their acceptance of the post-1989 status quo in Central Europe is the sine qua non of any relationship with us.  If the Russians have a problem with this--which they clearly seem to have--then we are all facing a major problem five or ten years down the road as Russia regains its strength.
<p>
	The Administration's rationale for delaying NATO enlargement has been twofold.  One is the claim that it will be easier to achieve such enlargement if we go about it gradually.  But the nationalist turn in Russian politics, expected to be given new impetus by the December elections for the Duma, tells us that it will not get any easier.  Russia is only getting stronger and more assertive; every month, the risks and inhibitions on our side will only grow.  The Administration's second rationale (at least so I suspect) is what philosophy majors will remember as Zeno's Paradox: the idea that if you divide a distance into an infinite number of tiny increments, you never get to the destination.  This may be the Administration's real calculation.  In other words, it just doesn't want to enlarge NATO--for fear of antagonizing Moscow.  The first rationale is bad judgment; the second is bad faith.
<p>
	Whatever the short-term plaudits due to the Administration for putting the Bosnia conflict on ice, in Central Europe we are seeing a strategic blunder of historic proportions.

<head><title>The Week -- NR</title></head>

<center>
<h2>The Week</h2>
<hr></center>
<P>

<P><li>
The Federal Government briefly shut down on our 35th anniversary.
Never ones to rest on our laurels, for our 40th we arranged a
shutdown rather more spectacular than the last. For our 45th,
we plan to shut down the Supreme Court.
<P><li>
The Florida straw poll was the last of those elusive pre-primary
events that reflect in equal parts hype and organizational energy,
and generate a wave of analysis that discounts the results even
as it dissects them. The common wisdom from Orlando, as it turns
out, is roughly right: Dole remains the front-runner but is still
a weak one; Gramm's second-place finish was what he needed to
remain viable; Alexander suffered from expectations that he might
come in second, but his finish close to Gramm inches him near
the top tier; everyone else is going to have trouble running a
national campaign (although Buchanan is looking strong in New
Hampshire, and Alan Keyes, who is running on nothing except his
soaring words, continues to inspire a slice of GOP activists).
But the straw poll should send the clearest signal to Bob Dole.
So far, he has run a campaign about as near to flawless (except
for incessant ``off-message'' unscripted comments -- the latest
in Time) as could be expected given his record and inclinations.
And the result is still tepid: a third of the vote, after pouring
a million dollars and impressive organizational resources into
an event stocked with party regulars. If this is what it's like
when the going is good, what happens after a gaffe?
<P><li>
To paraphrase an old feminist line, the U.S. without a Federal
Government is like a fish without a fish-hook.
<P><li>
A few months back, conservatives were criticizing Sheila Burke,
chief of staff to Sen. Bob Dole, for allegedly tugging her boss
leftward. Our own Rich Lowry noted that some of the criticisms
were ``over the top'' and suggested that Dole, not his staffers,
was responsible for any disappointments from his office [``The
101st Senator,'' July 31]. Now Jason DeParle has written a cover
story for the New York Times Magazine under the headline, ``Sheila
Burke is the Militant Feminist Commie Peacenik Who's Telling Bob
Dole What to Think,'' and the subhead, ``Well, no. She's just
the senator's moderate chief of staff, the latest victim of the
conservative attack machine.'' Where to start? No conservative
described Mrs. Burke as a ``Commie peacenik,'' etc. Since NR's
balanced article contradicts his premise, DeParle ignores it except
to mention a minor error that was immediately acknowledged in
the magazine. The cover promises an expose of ``The Campaign to
Demonize Sheila Burke,'' as if DeParle considers it ``demonization''
to call a liberal a liberal -- which, considering what most Americans
think, isn't so far off. Keep ruminating, DeParle: you've come
up with one half-truth, you may find another.
<P><li>
But when the New York Times is fair, how can we fail to be? So
we applaud the Times for its headline after the GOP took the Louisiana
governorship: ``Republicans Regain/National Momentum/With Louisiana
Win.'' Just kidding.
<P><li>
On November 21, the President announced that the Dayton talks
had produced a Bosnia agreement, and he promised to ``consult''
with Congress before a peace treaty was signed and U.S. troops
were sent to police it. Four days earlier, the House had passed,
243 to 171, the Hefley amendment barring any Bosnia deployment.
The President will probably be able to make a veto of this stick,
but a positive vote of support may be out of reach, even in the
afterglow of the agreement. On one side of the debate will be
arguments about the last best chance for peace, keeping a promise
made to allies, and preserving U.S. influence in Europe; on the
other side, arguments about the flaws and shakiness of the ``peace''
and the risks to American soldiers. Sending troops without a congressional
vote of support would compound all the risks, both in Bosnia and
at home, and in all likelihood lead to 1) an attack on U.S. troops
by whichever side finds their presence an obstacle, and 2) their
withdrawal by an Administration not known for its courage under
pressure. That would damage U.S. leadership far more than a refusal
to provide American forces now. Our advice to Mr. Clinton is borrowed
from the Duke of Wellington: ``You have got yourself into a damned
difficult spot, and you must think hard how best to get out of
it.''
<P><li>
If the California Civil Rights Initiative gets enough signatures
to qualify for the ballot, it will almost certainly win -- and
quite possibly scuttle President Clinton's chances of re-election.
But the CCRI is in deep trouble, partly because people mistakenly
assume it is a done deal, partly because of the campaign's own
amateurism. Paid petitioning has been suspended for lack of funds,
and only a fraction of the required signatures has been collected.
Now is the time for the national Republican Party to set up an
independent petition drive to get the CCRI on the ballot; and
for GOP  presidential candidates and California congressmen to
donate soft money to aid that drive. Republicans cannot afford
to let the CCRI fail. Nor can any American who believes that people
should be judged by their individual qualities, not by their race.
<P><li>
Remember Hillary's task force to socialize American medicine?
The White House said it cost $100,000, which turns out to be off
by a factor of at least 138 -- somewhere between an ordinary Clinton
fib and a whopper. The real figure is now put at $13.8 million,
maybe more, who knows?
<P><li>
President Clinton's intervention in Haiti seemed to be going swimmingly
-- until November. First, prime minister Smarck Michel resigned
to protest President Aristide's refusal to proceed with economic
reform. Then, Aristide began to foment violence in an apparent
effort to undermine -- and perhaps to head off -- presidential
elections scheduled for December 17. Aristide's words and actions
have become so indefensible that even his cheerleaders at the
New York Times front-paged a story about the worsening mess. Where
are things now heading? Either to an election seen as illegitimate
by most of Haiti's democrats, in which the leftist Rene Preval
becomes president, or to massive disorder, which permits Aristide
to stay in power. It's entirely plausible that our troops will
leave on schedule, but their departure may well be followed by
yet more violence and even another coup. Isn't this where we came
in, a few hundred million dollars ago?
<P><li>
Fred West, the English serial killer who buried nearly a dozen
bodies at 25 Cromwell Street, Gloucester, was writing his memoirs
in prison when he hanged himself. He entitled them I Only Ever
Loved an Angel. The jury did not entirely agree with him. It had
little difficulty in finding the supposed angel, his wife, Rosemary,
guilty of murdering her daughter, stepdaughter, and lodger (who
was pregnant at the time by Mr. West). By comparison with the
goings-on at Number 25, as revealed at the trial, Fellini's Satyricon
looked like an evangelical crusade for chastity. For the most
part, the sexually insatiable Wests preyed upon rootless young
women from the underclass whom they enticed into their home, where
they tied them up, beat and raped them, killed them, dismembered
them, and then buried them. Their most active period of unspeakable
depravity was the 1970s. The picture of life in the English underclass
that emerged from the trial was horrific in the extreme. One lesson
to be learned from the whole sordid episode is that the underclass
was clearly in place before the advent of Mrs. Thatcher, who is
often blamed for creating it. The West trial, in fact, was a reductio
ad nauseam of the values of the 1960s -- self-expression without
self-restraint.
<P><li>
Incidentally, Dr. Jack Kevorkian presided over his 26th snuffing,
and still hasn't received a Clinton nomination to be the new surgeon
general.
<P><li>
Last January, the Claremont Institute brought together 17 prominent
conservatives -- including Richard Brookhiser, Angela ``Bay''
Buchanan, Linda Chavez, Alan Keyes, Ed Meese, Ralph Reed, William
A. Rusher, and Bret Schundler -- to consider the culture wars.
The ``Conservative Manifesto'' they came up with calls for a renewed
commitment to ``the moral and natural law,'' a project of restoration
that has two steps: ``dismantling . . . ruinous bureaucracies,''
and fighting relativism in the culture. The friends of freedom
and virtue must hang together, or they will hang separately. The
manifesto is a good antidote to liberal pundits eager to see the
conservative coalition break up. If it is less detailed than the
Declaration of Independence, that is because the Founders' enemy
was smaller, and less protean.
<P><li>
Most minorities, according to a Labor Department survey, prefer
older racial and ethnic designations over newfangled multiculturalist
alternatives. Blacks, for example, are most likely to describe
themselves as such (45 per cent); only 28 per cent choose ``African
American.'' Likewise, Hispanics overwhelmingly favor that title
over the liberal-chic ``Latino'' (57 per cent to 12 per cent);
and American Indians scalped ``Native American'' by a margin of
49 to 37 per cent. Whether the Census will respect the wishes
of these groups remains to be seen. Meanwhile, more questions
for the next survey: how many liberals call themselves liberals;
how many feminists call themselves women; how many Episcopalians
call themselves Christian.
<P><li>
The fictional Administration in Rob Reiner's movie The American
President bears a sharp resemblance to the real Administration
of Bill Clinton, down to the  wisp of hair on the forehead of
Michael J. Fox as President Shepherd's Stephanopolitan chief domestic
advisor. But Shepherd is less like the actual incumbent than like
Mr. Clinton's daydream of himself: a strong, decisive leader;
a principled liberal; popular with the electorate and with a sexy
lady whom he gets to bed down right in the White House; highly
organized; slim; a widower.
<P><li>
Samuel Francis, a scholar of political theory and an occasional
contributor to NR, has lost his job as an editorial writer at
the Washington Times. In both his writing and his public speaking,
Mr. Francis had expressed some highly provocative opinions. Most
recently he chided the Southern Baptists for publicly regretting
their failure to fight slavery. Then Dinesh D'Souza, in his book
The End of Racism, quoted Mr. Francis as calling on whites to
``reassert our identity and our solidarity . . . in explicitly
racial terms.'' Now, these strike us as foolish views, especially
the latter: racial consciousness-raising would be as destructive
for whites as it has been for blacks. But are they hanging offenses?
An employer has the right to fire someone he feels is bad for
business. But the decision of Times editor Wesley Pruden to act
on this right was regrettable. At the New York Times, when the
editorial writer Brent Staples published, successively, a bizarre
admission that he had stalked Saul Bellow, and an illiterate attack
on Leo Strauss, he got clean away with it (no surprise: white
liberals expect very little from black liberals). That too was
wrong. Foolishness calls for a rebuke -- whether severe or light,
depending on the degree of foolishness and other mitigating circumstances
(the numerous writing awards Francis won for the Times). With
their respective treatments of wayward writers, neither Times
has done itself credit.
<P><li>
The FDA is thinking about allowing the hair-growth drug Rogaine
to be sold without a prescription, and more cheaply, too. One
instantly infers that the bureaucrats themselves are getting old
and bald. Perhaps there is hope yet for America.

ON THE RIGHT / Wm. F. Buckley Jr.
<P>
X-Ray Time
<P>
NEW YORK, NOVEMBER 14
<P>
It is useful to examine the federal deadlock through a strictly
democratic prism.
<P>
1. We have a separation of powers that authorizes Congress uniquely
to pass legislation; and a subdivision here that authorizes only
the House of Representatives to write bills that will cost money.
<P>
2. The President is authorized to veto any bill presented to him
by Congress. To override a presidential veto requires two-thirds
of the vote in each house.
<P>
3. In the existing situation, a majority of both houses passes
a measure that would simultaneously do a great many things, including
program an increase in payments required by the public to sustain
Medicaid and Medicare.
<P>
4. The President exercises his veto, complaining specifically
about the measure's health-care provisions.
<P>
5. Congressional leadership asks itself: Given that an override
of the veto cannot be recruited, how might Congress force its
hand on the President?
<P>
Force its hand!? Yes, that is what Messrs. Dole and Gingrich are
saying in effect, because they are seeking to implement what they
understand as strict instructions from the American people. They
are to move toward balancing the budget, and their plan for doing
so is blocked by the President's power.
<P>
But Congress also has power. The continuation of federal activity,
including the health benefits, requires financing. It is generally
assumed that so-called entitlements are inertial forces that cannot
be interrupted. But the forward movement of those forces requires
constant propulsion, and this is doable only by appropriations
by Congress.
<P>
The leadership is quite confident that its mandate hasn't withered
since it was enunciated in the November election. A national survey
done by Public Opinion Strategies only a week ago reveals that
66 per cent of Americans favor ``balancing the budget [even] if
that means that spending on Medicare and Medicaid would continue
to increase but at a lower rate.'' Accordingly, Congress uses
its trump card and freezes spending at the highest level authorized
by a preceding Congress, i.e., at 4.9 trillion borrowed dollars.
<P>
So: The people voted, Congress acted, the President vetoed, Congress
used its primordial power.
<P>
In a parliamentary system, such an impasse would be quickly solved.
The parliament would be dissolved, an election scheduled. If the
party upholding a balanced budget prevailed in that election,
the prime minister would resign and be replaced by a member of
the validated party. If otherwise, the prime minister would be
back with a compliant legislature. But then, the prime minister
wouldn't be occupying the executive mansion unless placed there
by the ruling faction in the legislature. What we face today is
what the British would call a constitutional crisis.
<P>
The public has not yet been discomfited, and no one will be for
a period, the exception being 800,000 furloughed federal workers.
The Treasury secretary is maneuvering and isn't likely to run
out of gas unless a major creditor nation decides that there is
too much harum-scarum going on and, instead of holding its reserves
in dollars, switches to yen, or marks, or pounds sterling.
<P>
What we do have is high-pitched political theater. The people
are vaguely aware of the instructions they gave to the new Congress,
but they are, with various degrees of intensity, concerned with
medical care, and that element of Americans most concerned is
of course the senior citizens, and it is they who exercise critical
clout. The President is relying on his incantatory evocations
of starving children and homeless old people, with here and there
a tear shed for what used to be Yellowstone Park. Presidential
indignation makes its way quickly to the headlines.
<P>
By contrast, it is Congress that is held to be the agent of all
those things, and we come quickly on the supreme irony, which
is that references are almost inevitably to the ``rigid,'' the
``defiant,'' the ``reckless'' Congress, the complement of the
lonely, single defender of the people's interest. There was never
a better example of everybody being out of step except Johnny.

<HR>
27-November-1995

<P>



<p><li>The Dole campaign accuses Sen. Gramm of using Jimmy Carter tactics. We don't know what this is all about, but we know mud when we see it flung.<p><li>The end of the ``revolution''? Not exactly. The results of the November 7 elections offer no signs of a Democratic resurgence. Democrats barely held onto the Kentucky governor's mansion and the Virginia State Senate -- both of which they have essentially owned since Reconstruction -- by mobilizing their base with scare talk about Newt Gingrich and GOP budget cuts. Republican voters, meanwhile, appeared to suffer from complacency, an almost inevitable reaction to 1994. The GOP momentum has unquestionably slowed. But the inertia had set in months ago, especially in the U.S. Senate. A Republican Congress elected to reshape American politics has left its contours remarkably unaltered: so far, no tax cuts, no welfare reform, no end to affirmative action, no regulatory relief -- in short, no tangible benefits for Middle America. So who needs more Republicans? If the elections are taken as proof that the GOP has gone ``too far'' -- if they prompt Republicans to back off before any of their agenda has become law -- voters will inevitably be asking the same question next year.
<p><li>In a partial-birth abortion, the infant is pulled feet first from his mother's womb while the head is kept just within the uterus; the abortionist then punctures the infant's skull and suctions the brain out. (You can understand why pro-abortionists would rather talk about ``choice'' than about these grisly realities.) By a vote of 288 to 139, the House of Representatives passed a bill to ban this vile procedure -- and, in the process, shattered the myth that social issues are tearing Republicans apart. In fact it was Democrats, not Republicans, who were split. If the Senate follows the House's lead, President Clinton will be forced to choose between enraging his most vocal supporters and defending the indefensible. Abortionists are already enraged: in the words of one New York Times story, ``Most of the doctors interviewed said they saw no moral difference between dismembering the fetus within the uterus [and] partially delivering it, intact, before killing it.'' They are, of course, correct.

<p><li>The debate among conservatives over Colin Powell was already burning nicely when Bill Bennett threw gasoline on the fire with some ill-chosen words on abortion. Social-conservative activists had criticized him for speaking favorably of Gen. Powell despite his pro-choice position, and Mr. Bennett blasted back. ``Holding onto the chimera of a constitutional amendment to outlaw abortion (the means) has done nothing to reduce the number of abortions (which ought to be the end).'' Pro-lifers would do better, he argued, to support presidential candidates who would talk about ``teen abstinence, adoption, crisis-pregnancy centers, individual responsibility, and the importance of a civilization's common moral code.'' Finally, he maintained that proponents of a Human Life Amendment, to be logically consistent, should advocate applying the penalties for first-degree murder to doctors who perform abortions and women who procure them. Mr. Bennett's empirical claim is debatable: abortion rates have fallen over the last decade and a half, and surely the cultural impact of the campaign for the HLA had something to do with that decline. He errs more seriously in describing anti-abortion laws as merely a means to an end. The ``right'' to take a life unjustly would remain a blot on the nation's conscience and its lawbooks even if nobody chose to exercise it. And abortion laws, contrary to his assertion, never invoked penalties equivalent to those for first-degree murder. Mr. Bennett's proposed alternative -- a lot of talk about consensus virtues -- is striking in its timidity. Polls continue to show strong public support for substantial abortion regulation; pro-abortion intellectuals are in retreat; and pro-lifers have scored significant political victories -- most spectacularly in 1994, when not a single pro-life incumbent of either party lost an election to a pro-choice candidate. Given these trends, pro-lifers would be better advised to escalate their demands than to settle for an agenda that Hillary Clinton could happi
ly endorse.

<p><li>If this is part of a sequel, The Book of Easy Virtues, Mr. Bennett should be warned that it will be a long, long volume.<p><li>Rep. James Saxton (R., N.J.) is House Chairman of the Joint Economic Committee (JEC), responsible among other things for producting studies that illustrate the benefits of Republican policies like, oh, balancing the budget. So it was no small embarrassment when Saxton, who enjoys a safe congressional seat and hence has no discernible need to pander, voted against the House GOP's budget and Medicare plan, despite a last-minute deal that sent an extra $750 million to his state. (Surely the House leadership can find a JEC chairman who actually votes the way his committee's literature reads.) New Jersey Rep. Dick Zimmer, who plans to run for Bill Bradley's Senate seat, deserted the GOP too, laying to rest any doubts that he would be an additional Senate roadblock to Republican reform. A roadblock like Maine's William Cohen, who after extracting concessions on regulation of nursing-home care and other matters still voted against the Senate Republican budget because he couldn't in good conscience vote to cut taxes. But all this looks almost statesmanlike in comparison to Pat Buchanan's new radio ad attacking GOP Medicare reform as ``cuts'' unfair to the elderly, a particularly naked bit of opportunism from a politician who prides himself on principle. Maybe the next Contract with America should propose career limits.<p><li>Why is Sen. Barbara Boxer participating in the Whitewater oversight hearings? Her daughter, Nicole, is married to Hillary Clinton's brother Anthony. Nicole Boxer Rodham, therefore, is Hillary's sister-in-law. Perhaps this explains Sen. Boxer's blind defense of Bill and Hillary throughout the Whitewater hearings. But it does not explain why her colleagues tolerate what most people would consider a serious conflict of interest. One wonders what former Sen. Bob Packwood thinks of Sen. Boxer's conduct.<p><li>In case it slipped by you, Saddam Hussein won re-election in Ir
aq with a comfortable 99.5 per cent of the vote. The other 0.5 per cent were members of his family who defected to Jordan.<p><li>``For thirty years, Ottawa's federalists have claimed successively that the Quebec separatist dragon did not exist, that its jaws were not open, that it was not going to swallow anyone and -- now -- that Confederation will escape by hanging onto its tonsils.'' NR said that last year about the complacency that greeted the Parti Quebecois's victory in the provincial elections. After the stunningly close vote in the October 30 referendum on sovereignty (see page 32), the Ottawacrats are hanging onto the dragon's tonsils by their fingernails. Even more significant than the overall squeaker was the 60 per cent vote for the Yes cause among French-speakers, a margin of victory that a referendum on American independence probably could not have achieved in New England in 1776. A nation is in quest of a state in Quebec, and Premier Jacques Parizeau was only being realistic when, in his much-denounced concession speech, he pointed out the anomaly that this quest is being frustrated only by the province's English-speaking and immigrant minorities. Naturally, he has been excoriated by the Ottawacrats' Canadian mouthpieces and by their liberal soulmates here. More surprising is to find the usually sensible Charles Krauthammer, in the November 3 Washington Post, decrying the breakup of Canada over ``an issue as relatively trivial as language.'' There could be no better measure of the extent to which even some of America's conservative intellectuals have lost sight of the ethnic and cultural realities that constitute a sense of common nationhood. Except, of course, for our own immigration and language policies.<p><li>U.S. Army medic Specialist Michael G. New is before a court-martial because he refused to don United Nations insignia when his unit (of the 3rd Infantry Division) was assigned to peacekeeping duties in Macedonia. He had served meritoriously before, including a tour in Kuwait last year, b
ut he balked at exchanging his U.S. Army insignia and status for the UN blue helmet and for the nebulous status of serving under UN command. His rationale is that he swore allegiance to the United States, not to the United Nations. Now, individual GIs cannot be allowed to make decisions of high policy. But policymakers ought to make better decisions. The Clinton Administration's infatuation with multilateralism long ago went over the top. If we want to be in Macedonia, we should be there under the red, white, and blue. And New should be reassigned to Alaska, not court-martialed.<p><li>NATO has been searching for a new Secretary General since Willy Claes stepped down to face charges in connection with a Belgian bribery scandal. The real scandal, as NR was among the first to point out, was that Claes held the position in the first place. In the early Eighties, the Belgian Socialist had opposed deployment in Europe of U.S. Pershing II and cruise missiles (NATO's response to the Soviet SS-20s), which should have disqualified him. Good riddance. Now, the leading candidate to succeed Claes is Ruud Lubbers, a Dutch Christian Democrat and former prime minister who supported the Euromissile deployment. He is a firm Atlanticist. The Clinton Administration, showing the strategic judgment for which it is so famous, supported Claes to the end and has been resisting Lubbers -- apparently because European NATO members have openly favored him, and Washington does not want to have a staunch pro-American foisted on us by a bunch of pesky foreigners.
<p><li>President Clinton ran a new, wholly unexpected Core Belief up the flagpole, confessing that he had raised taxes too much. Next day, after the Democratic establishment had voiced shock and dismay, Mr. Clinton's Core Belief was back to being ``very, very proud'' of the tax increase, and life returned to normal.<p><li>``The ultimate logic of a market economy is the gangsterization of culture. . . . The marketplace . . . is an extension of the laissez-white supremacy. . . . Same as those with homophobia, keeping trapped the humanity of gay brothers and lesbian sisters.'' No, this is not a scene from Dead Presidents. It is the racio-economic stylings of Cornel West -- liberal flavor of the month -- at the 25th anniversary celebration of the Catholic-funded Campaign for Human Development. For the last several years, drawing on reports from the Capital Research Center, we have been writing about the antics of CHD, which funds gay-rights activists, pro-abortionists, and radical feminist nuns -- all in the name of empowering the poor. In the words of one such activist pondering his good fortune: ``My God! I can't believe they're funding that here.'' Yet Catholics continue to pony up for this organization amid denials from pastors and bishops that, as Catholic readers report to us, go something like this: ``What do you expect from a bunch of conservatives?'' We are glad to see that fallacies like the ad hominem are still taught in Catholic seminaries, but disturbed that they seem to be given as exercises. This year, when the basket comes around for the Campaign for Human Development, just refuse to participate in the ``gangsterization'' of Catholicism.<p><li>Three relics of one of those Arcadian Indian civilizations so cruelly snuffed out by the Spanish Empire were uncovered by scientists on an Andean mountain peak. Frozen and perfectly preserved, they had been killed by Native American priests as a sacrifice to the gods of Mount Ampato. It was an Inca thing. You wouldn't understand.

THE AIDS PLAGUE<br>
Dying of the Light<br>
Presumably aware of the dangers they court, homosexuals continueto contract AIDS at an astonishing rate. The 'support' theyreceive for doing so is unconscionable.
<br>MIDGE DECTER<br>
Mrs. Decter is a writer living in New York City.<br>


<p>SINCE 1981, the experts tell us, some 441,528 Americans have been diagnosed with AIDS. Of these, it is said, about half have contracted the disease as a result of male homosexual coupling, and another quarter as a result of using contaminated needles for intravenous drug consumption. The rest are in one way or another simply victims of the above: people who have been given transfusions with infected blood, or women whose husbands have taken their secret extramarital pleasures with infected men, or babies born to AIDS-infected mothers. To be sure, in that same period the rates for heart disease and cancer have been much higher, but considering that AIDS has so far proved to be not only incurable but invariably fatal, the number of its sufferers has struck everyone as especially terrible.

<p>An even more terrible number, however, is the 187,309 new cases reported for the years 1993 and 1994. For whereas the earliest AIDS patients knew nothing of their potential affliction until it was too late, by 1993 the means for avoiding infection were very widely known -- indeed, in some places were even being taught to schoolchildren -- and surely universally known to the country's homosexual population. Thus it must be assumed that (with the exception of wives ignorant of what their husbands were doing on the sly and the doomed babies of criminally negligent mothers) the bulk of the most recently recorded cases have been contracted with foreknowledge of the dangers. Particularly in a society as health-obsessed and disease-conscious as our own, this most recent statistic fairly boggles the mind.

<p>Is it, then, willful suicide, or hubris, or the former posing as the latter, that has lately been leading so many young homosexuals knowingly to engage in the kind of unprotected sex that is most calculated to leave them with AIDS? Finding the answer to this question is essential not only for understanding what is really involved in the effort to control the spread of the infection but also for getting a handle on the agenda of the homosexual activists.

<p>For a long time gay-rights activists have divided their time between, on the one hand, declaring that everyone, homosexual or heterosexual, is equally at risk of contracting AIDS, and, on the other hand, demanding special attention and compassion as a community uniquely victimized by it. The idea that everyone is at risk was, of course, meant to prevent a fresh mark of pariahdom from being set upon the brow of the so newly respectable homosexual community: homosexual sex was to be held no more dangerous and no more at fault for the spread of AIDS than the heterosexual variety. (This idea, in addition to leading to the disproportionate expenditure of government funds on research into a cure -- more than a billion dollars per year -- carried the added benefit of engaging homosexuals as homosexuals in the process of writing and/or revising health-education curricula.) On the other hand, the idea that the homosexual community is being singularly victimized has helped to fan the sense of injustice and outrage on which the gay-rights movement, like any rights movement, must depend for its political livelihood and that precisely as a result of its successes might be in danger of diminishing.

<p>Thus the issue of AIDS has plunged those activists who speak most loudly in the name of their fellow homosexuals even more deeply into the contradiction that trembles perpetually beneath their relations with the ``straight'' world -- the simultaneous assertion that they are the same as everyone else and that their experience is unique.

<p>In this, of course, gay politics is more or less like all the other forms of rights-politics in our time. With this one overriding difference: that while the two other current major rights movements, the blacks' and the women's, are subject to essentially the same basic contradiction, neither of them happens to be beset by the complication that a significant number of its members and intended beneficiaries seem to be willfully courting death.

<p>Now, the connection of homosexuality to suicide -- a connection about which the most recent history of AIDS has left little room for doubt -- is, like most things having to do with suicide, in the end a profound mystery. It is, moreover, a mystery which it would be presumptuous, not to say useless, for anyone but homosexuals themselves to attempt to confront -- although confront it is something they would sooner or later be well advised to do. Still, what is in its way even more mysterious is the response of the homosexuals' putative friends and well-wishers to this scourge that has been racing virtually unhindered through their community. For surely never have people professing care and loving kindness been so admiring, so celebratory, of hopeless suffering as has the society of America's enlightened, liberal, rich, famous, and/or beautiful heterosexuals with respect to AIDS.

<p>There are two problems here, one perhaps not so difficult to understand, the other difficult indeed. The first has to do with the homosexuals themselves and their cooperative acceptance of what can be called, if not actual dancing, then certainly large-scale posturing on their graves. Can they really be so benighted as to regard public cheering in the face of their mortal danger as love? Would not scolding and imprecations and efforts to turn them from their fatal ways, however unpleasant, be truer marks of fellow feeling? Alas, so widespread and commonplace has the disease become among them that tolerance for AIDS and tolerance for them may have come to seem one and the same thing. And then, to be sure, there are the enormous political benefits for the gay-rights movements in AIDS's having become literally a cause celcbre.

<p>If memory serves, the celebration began almost immediately upon the country's becoming widely aware of the disease: with the death of Rock Hudson, who was possibly the first very famous person to die of it -- anyway certainly one of the earliest cases to be publicly acknowledged. No doubt millions of American women were stricken to discover that this figure who had for so long haunted their daydreams had in fact been a homosexual and had been carried off as a result of a sexual career both hidden from, and a denial of, them. But whatever that first shock, it must soon have been dispelled by the way a whole raft of people in Hollywood responded to what would once have been a scandal by coming very close to claiming that they had witnessed their colleague being assumed into heaven in a fiery chariot.

<p>And almost from that first moment it was decreed by those who dictate the nation's displays of stylish sentiment that not only would no whisper of shame be attached to what is after all essentially a venereal disease, but indeed suffering from AIDS would be deemed an honorific condition. Nor would it be honored only in profound thought and sensitive prose but, on the contrary, in the most determined and lavish public display. This decree did not, of course, extend to those who became diseased as a result of intravenous drug use; that was tacky. And as for the innocent victims -- hemophiliacs, babies, and so on -- for them there would of course be pity and charitable gestures but certainly no celebration. To be celebrated for having been felled by AIDS -- which is to say, to be sung, storied, eulogized, lobbied for, polemicized about, and truly wept over -- one had to be a homosexual. In other words, one had to have contracted the disease the good old-fashioned venereal way, through heedless (or lately, we are told, intentional) acts of anal and/or oral sex with already infected and equally heedless male partners.

<p>Which brings us to the second problem; call it the puzzle of the scarlet ribbon. Do healthy people who pin the shiny red commemoration of AIDS to their lapel -- and their number is by now legion -- mean to express by it their solidarity with those who are gone? With those who are about to go? With those who will one day inevitably be going? With the disease itself? The issue is not a trivial one, for what does it mean to make a gesture of fellowhood with people who have contrived to become hopeless when one has not oneself?

<p>Perhaps the ultimate in such display was reached in that moment of the Academy Awards ceremony of 1994 when Tom Hanks, accepting the Oscar for his performance as a man afflicted with AIDS, got swept across the boundary between performance and reality and, before an audience of millions, wept with love for his momentarily imagined fellow AIDS sufferers; ``angels in heaven,'' is what he tearfully pronounced them to be. (Hanks himself, of course, would soon be going on to another hugely successful movie, while who knows how many of his potential ``angels'' would be climbing into their beds of pain.)

<p>Actors and their emotions aside, it is no small thing for people who are in virtually no danger of coming down with AIDS -- and who, whatever they say, well know that they are in no such danger -- to make a show of cheering on those who are unlikely to escape it. Under ordinary circumstances, the word for such a show would be cruelty. It is not altogether unlike the behavior of the crowds that gather and watch with bated breath when someone threatens to jump from the ledge of a tall building: whatever such behavior signifies, we could certainly not call it compassion.

<p>Is it, then, that their self-styled friends and sympathizers among the heterosexuals subconsciously wish for homosexuals to die -- much as those crowds subconsciously wish for the figure perched on the high ledge to jump? The answer is of course no. Doubly no: nothing so horrible and nothing so simple. But what they are almost certainly up to is something no less difficult to admit to themselves. For the one unmentionable thing that AIDS has accomplished is to make sex dangerous, and hence important, again.

<p>It would seem that human beings cannot for too long abide our present-day toleration for, and openness to, the possibility of mindless, effortless copulation. It enervates them, and leaves them with an unpleasant sensation of floating, of, as Milan Kundera so perfectly called it, ``the unbearable lightness of being.''

<p>Among heterosexuals, until only the day before yesterday, the ever-present threat or possibility of pregnancy made sex important -- dangerous, even. Now with effective contraception and easy-come-easy-go abortion, what is there to supply the sense of consequence? Under the old anti-promiscuity dispensation, men used to dream of sex without bother, without the burdensome necessities of entanglement. Ironically, what heterosexual men have always dreamed of -- or rather, daydreamed of -- is precisely what homosexual men used to have. In any case, as quickly became evident in those singles bars that served for a time as the local soviets of the sexual revolution, the heterosexual men did not thrive on being granted what they had so much wanted. (About their women, don't even ask.)

<p>In the case of the homosexuals, liberalism deprived them, too, of a good deal of that which had for so long lent consequence to their sex lives, namely, danger -- the danger of exposure and danger from the cops. They came out of the closet and marched in the streets with police protection, and yet seemed to grow ever more shrill and restless.

<p>Now there is AIDS, and there is consequence for them indeed.

<p>The good burghers who don their hiking clothes and go on fundraising walks ``for,'' as they put it, AIDS, the people who fill concert halls and theaters for benefit performances dedicated to AIDS, will tell you one of the reasons they are doing so is that unless a cure is found, we will soon all be at risk. Yet they know that they are not at risk; in 15 years they have seen only a handful of proper, well-off heterosexuals like themselves come down with the disease. Like Tom Hanks, they are play-acting.

<p>``For the rich to play at being poor,'' says a character in Lillian Hellman's <i>Toys in the Attic</i>, ``is a dirty game.'' For the healthy to pretend that they are in imminent danger of fatal illness is even dirtier. There are easier and more honest, though admittedly less popular, ways of trying to call off the sexual revolution.

<p>As for the homosexuals, the only true act of human fellowship with them would be to shake them by their collective shoulders and say over and over again: Cut that out!

ON THE RIGHT / Wm. F. Buckley Jr.


<br>

NEW YORK, OCTOBER 24
<p>Fifty years of the United Nations certainly does not bring on undifferentiated congratulations. The world organization received a jump start on hypocrisy when, in San Francisco, on a motion that Sweden, Switzerland, and Ireland be admitted, the ruling was negative, on the grounds that they were not ``peace-loving nations.'' They were three countries that had not gone to war. But the term ``peace-loving'' had already got into the hands of the wordsmiths who gave us the ``Democratic Republic of Germany,'' which was Soviet-speak for undemocratic unrepublican East Germany. 

<p>In the Security Council we had from the outset the Soviet Union as a permanent member with veto rights, and then China, with the same rights. And in the General Assembly, with spooky consistency the Third World powers voted against Western measures, in line with Soviet measures. When in 1960 Fidel Castro, freshly arrived in power, visited the UN, he was hailed as a hero. In 1979, after he had clearly established himself as a ruler as tyrannical as those who presided over North Korea and Albania, he visited the United Nations again; and, again, was treated as a hero by the majority of its members. 

<p>On Sunday, President Clinton opened the celebratory proceedings by giving a moderate speech about this and that. Later in the day, Castro spoke -- the usual tirade against Western conventions, larded with the usual declamations in favor of self-government everywhere except in Cuba -- and got an ovation. Much heavier applause than that given to the President of the host country, our old friend, the superpower, Uncle Sam. 

<p>We pause to note that one reason for the anti-U.S. fever within the UN these days is our failure to pay our debt to the UN. When the organization was founded, President Truman accepted an imposition on the U.S. of 40 per cent of the UN's budget. In the immediate postwar world that was not an unreasonable allocation, given that we were at the time generating about 50 per cent of the world's production. In 1972 we reduced our share to 25 per cent, in line with the reviving economic fortunes of other countries. But in 1982 we began to stall on our payments, in part because we thought the allocations for peace-keeping expenses were rigged against us, in part because the relevant committees in Congress found it tempting to economize at the expense of an organization not all that popular back home.

<p>But the result of it is a very considerable embarrassment. If the State Department believes we are unfairly burdened, then that case should be made. But to make it by simply refusing to pay is to act the deadbeat. We are not alone in lateness in paying our share, but we are the major offender and certainly the most conspicuous. It would be nice to hear from the presidential candidates that they don't go for cheating on obligations, whether to the American Express Company or to the United Nations.

<p>The pointed objective of Fidel Castro this time around is to generate pressure to repeal the U.S. embargo. It is nice to see the tatterdemalion prince of universal prosperity through Marxism begging U.S. business to come on down and give him a hand. And on the merits of the argument, there is every reason to restore relations with Cuba given that it is no longer a salient of a global power seeking the overthrow of the United States. We would need to swallow our pride, but then that is healthy: we did not succeed in bringing Castro down, and it is not dignified to salve our bad consciences by continuing policies appropriate only during the Cold War. We are trading with Vietnam and China, and we never really broke off from trading with the Soviet Union, so why Castro?

<p>He made his demonstration at the UN, and sharply, and sadly, reminded us all that if the division within the UN were once again suddenly to return to Communist superpower challenging Western superpower, we'd almost certainly find ourselves face to face with the old lineup. About 80 per cent anti-American. The old juices run strong, anti-, and jealous of, success; there are memories mired in anti-colonialist slogans, and then, too, some defensible skepticism over U.S. leadership. 

<p>But the UN is with us. We should pay our debt, ignore most of its pieties, and make policy as we have always made it, soliciting UN sanction but quite prepared, when necessary, to ignore it.

Deconstruction, American-Style

<p>
<li>Much of this issue is devoted, in one way or another, to race. But then, so is much of American politics. The 
combination of the O.J. verdict and the Million Man March has shifted it to the forefront of politics again, 
temporarily overshadowing even Medicare.
<p>
As so often, however, the lessons being drawn from these events are the opposite of any reasonable 
conclusion. One subtle suggestion, as Mark Cunningham points out, is that the ``attack'' on affirmative 
action is responsible for the signs of increasing division between the races. 
This might be plausible if there had been signs of growing racial harmony before November 1994. In fact, 
as Paul Craig Roberts and Lawrence M. Stratton show, racial divisions have been steadily growing in step 
with the increasing scope, enforcement, and blatancy of the racial quotas at the heart of affirmative action. 
Nor is that curious. Race-conscious policies make people conscious of race.
It is alarming, however, that such race-consciousness has now reached the point where many black 
Americans have begun to think of themselves as a separate nation -- a kind of black English-speaking 
Quebec scattered across the American continent.<p>
That is, after all, the candid agenda of the Nation of Islam, of the Million Man March which it sponsored, 
and of influential black scholars and professionals who devote much ingenuity to constitutional schemes 
that would replace majority rule with cantonal democracy, racial vetoes, ``concurrent majorities,'' and 
various forms of racial proportionality.<p>
Until now, such ``fancy franchises'' have been waystations on the road to majority rule (as in South Africa). 
Will America be the first case in which they lead away from it? The question sounds far-fetched. So did the 
idea of racial quotas when Congress passed the Civil Rights Act.
America is now faced with two theories about itself: either it is a single people or it is a federation of many 
peoples. If the former, it will eliminate racial quotas and downplay race-consciousness generally in favor of 
an inclusive American identity. If the latter, it will move gradually toward racial proportionalism and its 
own deconstruction.<p>
These possibilities are incarnated in two men. Colin Powell embodies the inclusive concept of the American 
whose race is a secondary identity, Louis Farrakhan that of the black who has rejected the accident of being 
born American.<p>
Mr. Farrakhan argues his case forcefully; Mr. Powell does not yet seem to know there's a war on.
<p>


<li>Deconstructionism has been the theme of much speculation on the O.J. verdict. It has been claimed 
incessantly that black Americans, on and off the jury, ``saw'' the evidence differently because they brought 
their own experiences (of police brutality, etc.) to the judgment. Since whites had a different experience, 
black and white ``truths'' were different. And never the twain shall meet.
All this is the greatest nonsense. It denies that there is such a thing as truth or objective reality. Indeed, it 
logically implies that Simpson could be both guilty and innocent of his wife's murder -- depending upon 
who's reaching the verdict.<p>
But it is the identical argument used to justify ``diversity'' in the newsrooms of the mainstream press. As the 
diversity-mongers put it, we need black, Hispanic, lesbian, gay, etc. perspectives on the news. 
Of course, they don't know their own theories. Any competent Parisian deconstructionist could tell them 
that you can safely have a newsroom staffed by live white males because the readers create the texts (i.e., 
write the newspapers) by their own interpretations.<p>
Still, think of the Washington Post and the New York Times as newspapers specially tailored to the 
demands of the crowds who celebrated Mr. Simpson's acquittal.  -- JOHN O'SULLIVAN

<P> 

 
 
<p><li>Watch for our analysis of Louis Farrakhan's speech at the Million Man March, as soon as he finishes it. 
 
<p><li>Was President Clinton coaching him? 
 
<p><li>The conventional wisdom on the march stresses the dignity and decency of most of the men there, and says 
it's too bad that its main political effect will be to enshrine the noxious Louis Farrakhan as black America's 
most significant political leader. All that is true. And any crowd that boos Rep. John Conyers off the stage 
can't be all bad. Conservatives will even be tempted to praise Farrakhan's message of self-reliance and 
middle-class values as a revolt against the social liberalism of the welfare state. But to indulge blacks as 
they follow the lead of a hatemonger is condescending: adults have to be held responsible for their 
affiliations. And their revolt against liberalism is anyway incomplete. In favoring racial separatism, the 
Nation of Islam has taken ideas long favored by the liberal establishment -- separately tracked school 
admissions, racial employment criteria, segregated campus dormitories and congressional districts -- to their 
illogical conclusion. President Clinton is wrong to describe Farrakhan's bigotry as merely ``one man's 
message of malice and division.'' It is incidental neither to his program nor to his appeal to many black 
Americans. Both the uplifting and the ugly sides of Farrakhan's movement flow from an ideology that posits 
blacks as aliens, as members of a proud and separate polity. Farrakhan does not think blacks should wear 
America's uniform or be subject to America's laws, or that non-blacks should own property or run 
businesses in black neighborhoods. The only antidote to this message is the cultivation of an overarching 
sense of an American identity. It will not be promoted by merely biting our lips as Farrakhan becomes a 
power broker in American politics. 
 
<p><li>According to the Washington Times, one rebellious -- we hope -- soul held up a placard that read: ``ELECT 
FARRAKHAN - SIMPSON.'' 
 
<p><li>The campaign to end the income tax continues to gain momentum on Capitol Hill. Reps. Dan Schaefer (R., 
Colo.) and Billy Tauzin (R., La.) have drafted legislation to replace the personal-income, corporate-income, 
capital-gains, and estate taxes with a 16 per cent national sales tax. Not to be outdone, freshman Rep. Joe 
Scarborough of Florida is working on a 10 per cent national sales tax to replace the personal-income tax. To 
those who argue that ending the income tax for good would require repealing the Sixteenth Amendment, 
Rep. Sam Johnson (R., Tex.) has proposed a new constitutional amendment: ``Three years after the 
ratification of this article of amendment, the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States 
is repealed, and the Congress shall have no power to lay and collect taxes on incomes except in times of 
war.'' Let the Court find the penumbras in that one. 
 
<p><li>President Clinton will soon issue a statement vowing to devote the rest of his life to searching for the real 
killer of the Democratic Party. 
 
<p><li>Under assault for its aggressive agenda, the Legal Services Corporation has been portraying itself as an 
essential provider of legal services to the poor. However, in a recent Capital Research Center newsletter, 
David Wilkinson, inspector general of the LSC from 1989 to 1991, opens a new line of attack, writing that 
``sufficient resources exist to provide legal assistance to the poor without LSC.'' Turns out that more than 
500,000 lawyers contribute nearly 25 million hours a year of pro bono work valued at an estimated $3.4 
billion; this is five times the number of hours worked by LSC attorneys, and eight times the LSC budget. 
The LSC complains that these numbers are too high because they include attorneys who work individually 
rather than through an organization -- although the poor represented by such attorneys surely are 
unconcerned by the difference. These lawyers are also criticized for doing pro bono work that is 
``traditional'' rather than ``controversial.'' In other words, non-LSC lawyers perform the traditional purpose 
of helping poor people, rather than the controversial one of blocking welfare reform and harassing 
employers. 
 
<p><li>Sen. Sam Nunn won't run for re-election in '96, the eighth Democratic incumbent to take a pass. The Iraqi 
army had fewer deserters during the Gulf War. 
 
<p><li>The number of Americans living in poverty declined in 1994. The bad news is that for an economy 
performing so well, the decline -- from 15.1 to 14.5 per cent -- was pitifully small. But is the news really so 
bad? The government's poverty statistics don't count in-kind transfers like food stamps and housing 
subsidies, and they overstate inflation. Income is a famously misleading indicator of need; cf. the banker's 
son who enters the ranks of the poor by moving out of Dad's estate. Nearly 40 per cent of all ``poor'' 
Americans own their homes. Economists who study these issues have developed an alternative poverty 
measure, one based on what people actually consume rather than the money they take in. Consumption 
poverty fell steadily throughout the 1980s. The reputed failure of Reaganomics to ``lift all boats'' seems 
rooted in statistical malpractice. Surely the poverty industry will embrace this more accurate, and more 
hopeful, analytic prism. Well, maybe not. 
 
<p><li>Willie Brown recently encouraged students to, ``basically, just terrorize'' Professor Glynn Custred, co-
author of the California Civil Rights Initiative, which would outlaw state-sponsored affirmative action. This 
from the other side of the debate. 
 
<p><li>Heard any good economist jokes lately? Here's one: In March 1981, 364 economists wrote the Times of 
London to warn that Margaret Thatcher's economic policies were destroying the economy. The punch line: 
a recent New York Times article detailing the mad dash of foreign investors into Britain. Over the past 
decade Britain has become the preferred European location for the big three Japanese automakers (Nissan, 
Toyota, and Honda) and for large Asian electronics manufacturers such as Samsung and Fujitsu, as well as 
for German and French manufacturers seeking expansion beyond their high-cost home markets. American 
companies, building upon a long tradition, invested 7.5 times more in Britain between 1986 and 1993 than 
in Germany. Thatcherism didn't carry the day without a struggle. For years Europe derided Britain's 
economy as being too much like America's. Translation: Job security was sacrificed to economic growth. 
Now, with French unemployment stuck at 11.5 per cent and German labor costs nearly double Britain's, 
Continental policymakers are wondering whether to emulate the British experience. Tax cuts, privatization, 
and deregulation were important. But the biggest piece of the puzzle, according to a prominent German 
industrialist, was the defanging of the unions. This, of course, was the quintessence of Thatcherism -- unless 
it was ignoring establishment economists. 
 
<p><li>Hillary Rodham Clinton was seen in South America, her hair done in an Evita bun. We hope she gets the 
job down there, but she will probably be back. 
 
<p><li>It could have been worse. The Nobel Peace Prize this year could have gone to Jimmy Carter. Instead it went 
to Joseph Rotblat and the East - West arms-control dialogue that has proceeded for nearly forty years under 
the aegis of the Pugwash conference, named for the town in Nova Scotia where it first met. The Pugwash 
gatherings provided one of the earliest networking opportunities for Western and Soviet scientists and 
academics. Pugwash was innocent enough in theory, though too often a forum of agitation against NATO 
defense policies and U.S. negotiating positions. The timing of the prize -- the 50th anniversary of Hiroshima 
-- was invidious too. But the grinding of molars, audible all the way from Plains, Ga., almost makes up for 
it. 
 
<p><li>The New York State Trial Lawyers Association has people walk every block of New York City recording 
any and all cracks in the sidewalks. By sending this record to the city government, they ensure themselves a 
case whenever someone trips. You can't call it ambulance chasing -- they're there before the ambulance 
arrives. 
 
<p><li>Conservative economists on the far side of 45 have a special advantage when it comes to appreciating 
Nobel Prize - winner Robert Lucas's contribution. They were brought up on Paul Samuelson's Economics, 
which demonstrated, with crystalline examples and simple diagrams, how the right mix of government tax 
and monetary policy could banish the business cycle and ensure prosperity, and they came of age as Walter 
Heller and Gardner Ackley seemed to be proving Samuelson right. But then came the 1970s. 
Unemployment and inflation both rocketed to near record levels, violating the Phillips Curve (Samuelson, 
p. 344), in which higher inflation produces less unemployment. Robert Lucas spotted the flaw: When prices 
rise unexpectedly, producers initially think that things really have gotten better. They hire more workers 
until, as invariably happens, the price rise affects things that they themselves buy -- notably labor. Producers 
eventually come to expect this chain of events and are no longer snookered by changes in monetary policy. 
With this simple insight Lucas showed that Emperor Keynes was naked. His critique became a rallying cry 
for young conservatives chafing under the interventionist consensus. 
 
<p><li>It would be kind of opportunistic, but one way Steve Forbes could protest the capital-gains tax is by leading 
a Millionaire Men's March on Washington. 
 
 
<p><li>Even as congressional committees scrutinize the behavior of the FBI and U.S. Marshals at Ruby Ridge and 
Waco, the Environmental Protection Agency has developed its own ``green'' berets -- 147 gun-toting 
Special Agents with power to use force to seize records and make arrests, without court warrants. Sen. 
Lauch Faircloth (R., N.C.) has written the EPA inquiring by what authority its agents brandished guns in a 
raid on a shrimp farm in Ponce, Puerto Rico, in June 1990. The agents claimed the farm was in violation of 
wetlands regulations and seized the farm's records and some cash. Five years later John Pai White, the 
owner, has yet to get his money or his records back, even though no charges have been brought against him. 
In reply, EPA Administrator Carol Browner pointed to two paragraphs in the 1988 Medical Waste Tracking 
Act that give agents the power ``to carry firearms; execute and serve warrants; and make arrests without 
warrants for the investigation of criminal violations of any law administered by the EPA.'' If that isn't bad 
enough, the EPA's ``Firearms Policies and Procedures'' were approved by Attorney General Janet Reno. It's 
a good thing the EPA wasn't sent to investigate kerosene emissions at Waco, or there might have been a 
three-way shootout. 
 
<p><li>NR senior editor Jeffrey Hart is seeking reparations for the efforts of his forebears to end slavery. One was 
a colonel in the Union Army's artillery. Another took time out from his work as an artist to paint 
documentary murals of battle scenes for the Union Army. Several others served in the federal ranks. Mr. 
Hart will be pleased to receive one dollar from every descendant of former slaves. Reparations may be sent 
to him care of NR.

<P>
The Hangover
<P>
<P>NEW YORK, OCTOBER 5

<P>The brainy wife of the brainy professor said, ``I think the O.J. verdict should be protested.'' The brainy 
professor said, ``How?''
<P>Indeed. How?
<P>The prattle, in which such as Senator Dole are engaged, is that we must accept the verdict and turn over a 
new leaf. Well, it is one thing to accept the verdict as a juridical reality: Nobody is arguing that O. J. 
Simpson should be sent back to jail. It is quite another thing to abide by the superstition that justice has 
been done. A lot of white folks who lynched black folks in the bad days went scot free because white jurors 
wouldn't convict them. But there are those who left that age with their honor intact: they screamed and 
yelled, and insisted that justice was not done. Screaming and yelling doesn't come naturally to a lot of 
people, but the brainy wife of the brainy professor was right, the verdict should be protested. 
<P>One way to do this is to remark the little filigrees on formal acquittal, and resist their effrontery. Johnnie 
Cochran tells the press moments after the verdict that the will of God has been done, as he knew it would 
be. One sighs: someone who can compare Mark Fuhrman to Adolf Hitler can, one supposes, adduce the will 
of God as motivating the jury's finding. Let us in charity assume that the relatives of O.J. sincerely thought 
him to be innocent, and pass over their bulletins to the effect that justice had been done. But what are we to 
make of O.J.'s solemn declaration that, now that the distraction has been swept away, the police should get 
serious and search out the real killer. He, O.J., will do ``whatever it takes'' to identify him. One way to begin 
this search is for everyone to submit a blood sample to the laboratories. And then ask the one out of 28 
million with the telltale blood -- that adds up to about thirty people, sprinkled about in Tibet, Tierra del 
Fuego, and Kazakhstan -- what they were doing on the night of June 12, 1994.
<P>And yes, we really should equip ourselves against hit-and-run self-vindication by legerdemain. Johnnie 
Cochran was on <i>Larry King Live</i> on Wednesday saying what you would expect, the phone rings, and lo! 
O.J. is on the line. He says serene things, and then chastises a woman who had called in to ask Mr. Cochran 
to explain the shadowy creature who had been identified by the limo driver as coming into the Rockingham 
driveway just before 11 the night of the murders. O.J. says, Did the woman not<i> listen</i> to the witness, because 
the witness, if you followed him carefully, had said something quite different, and oh! how much he, O.J., 
had suffered from people drawing conclusions from the testimony which the testifiers had simply not said, 
understand?
<P>It is on the order of rising to say, ``I told you there wasn't a purple cow on the property that night, DID I 
NOT?'' People begin nodding their heads. We are off to the races with the reconstruction of the scene that 
night in June, one little piece at a time. 
<P>What effect will the verdict have on the career of Colin Powell, somebody asked? Answer: One would hope 
none. But there is most definitely a danger there. When 75 per cent of black Americans believe that the 
answer is A, not B, and 75 per cent of white Americans believe that the answer is B, not A, then what we 
have is a breakdown in communication between two cultures. Either we share a common language and a 
common rational apparatus or we do not. It is a very very scary thing when three-quarters of one ethnic 
group flatly disagree with three-quarters of another ethnic group about the structure of rational arguments. It 
is simply wrong to suppose that the white majority believed O.J. to be guilty because he was black. It is 
simply undeniable that the black majority believed him innocent because he was black. And -- remarkably -- 
those figures remained static throughout those endless months of testimony. It was tempting for the white 
majority to conclude that the black majority was engaged in iconolatry. O.J. is a hero and that is the end of 
it. 
<P>Not entirely hard to understand. If the spelunkers were to come up from their caves with evidence that St. 
Francis of Assisi ate live pigeons for breakfast, there are those of us who would simply refuse to believe it. 
Legends, to be legendary, must be sacred, inviolate. But this is not to dodge the question: Yes. If the 
innocence of O.J. is a black postulate, then intercommunication has suffered a quite awful setback.

<HR>
06-November-1995

<P>

<P>IN the 1930s, when James Burnham, later a founding editor of this magazine, was a young professor 
becoming committed to Marxism, he was recruited by Earl Browder, the head of the American Communist 
Party. Browder managed to explain all his party's doctrines but one: its endorsement, as dictated by Stalin's 
latest inspiration, of a separate state in the South for American blacks. Burnham knew that was a non-
starter, and moved on to Trotsky.
<P>How is it that what seemed fantastic sixty years ago, even in the heart of 
the totalitarian Left, can draw a Million Men (give or take a few hundred thousand) to Washington, and 
only ad hominem criticism of the march's sponsors?
<P>There is a black American identity, partly out of free 
choice, partly because centuries of racism have been perversely reinforced by thirty years of misguided 
liberalism. Busing, quotas, affirmative action, wars on poverty (read: black poverty), urban renewal (read: 
inner-city renewal), victimology, multiculturalism, diversity -- all conspire to set blacks apart, not in an 
affirmation of their culture or way of life, but because they are persuaded to feel they have no alternative in 
a racist white-majority America which wishes them ill.
<P>This ``community,'' so artificially maintained and so 
carefully hedged about, is experiencing a vacuum of leadership just now. Jesse Jackson has gone nowhere. 
The Congressional Black Caucus is a bunch of gerrymandered petty chieftains, who lost their institutional 
clout when the GOP took Congress. Black clergymen -- and this is a bad legacy of Martin Luther King -- 
have become what Burke called political theologians and theological politicians, as distracted in their way 
as their soulmates in the pulpits of the white Protestant mainstream. Into this void stepped Louis Farrakhan -
- scenery-chewing orator; leader of a thuggish cult; possible conniver in the murder of Malcolm X; inspired 
by visions from UFOs; expounder of the view that whites are devils produced by a prehistoric experiment in 
dysgenics on the island of Patmos; apologist for slavers, so long as they are Moslems who pay him off. This 
was his march; he was its ``onlie begetter.'' 
<P>But take Farrakhan out of the march -- and Alton Maddox, the 
lawyer who defended the hoaxster Tawana Brawley, and Farrakhan's aide, Khalid Mohammed, who praised 
the racist murderer Colin Ferguson -- and would the march have been the worthy thing that earnest liberals 
claimed?
<P>Self-help is a good thing -- if the self is helped to the right goals. It is not good for blacks to talk up 
economic nationalism (even if they don't use Farrakhan's imagery of ``bloodsuckers'' to describe non-blacks 
who deal in black neighborhoods). Korean storeowners provide services for their customers. If a black 
storeowner wants to provide the service, let him offer a better product or a lower price. If responsibility is 
the goal, why converge on Washington -- fount of the handouts that have done blacks such damage? Yes, 
that's where King marched in 1963 -- but by then, he was calling for welfare-state liberalism too.
<P>The religious revival is an old feature of American life -- older than independence. And celebrations of ethnicity 
have also been welcome, so long as they were combinations of good clean fun and Tocquevillian mediating 
institutions: the Columbus Day parade and the charitable society. There was a lot of this mixed up in the 
Million Man March. But American leaders, both black and white, have to sift it all out, and condemn the 
alloys.
<P>Colin Powell, concluding his book tour cum campaign swing, had an ideal chance to do so, and he 
wimped out. ``Let's let the people at the march make the judgment,'' he told reporters in New York on march 
day. ``Let's trust them to make an informed decision [about] what is wisdom, and what is not wisdom.'' But 
that's what leaders are supposed to do. Instead, he worked at earning back his advance, and becoming 
President-by-coronation.
<P>America will never become two literal nations. But, without hard thinking from 
men who would be leaders, and men who would be millions, we can be a house divided against itself -- and, 
pace Lincoln, such houses can stand, unhappily, for a long, long time.

<FONT SIZE=+3>A</FONT> <font size=+1>generation</font> after the civil-rights movement, Americans are once again engaged in a radical rethinking of their attitudes toward race. Racial preferences are now opposed by the vast majority of Americans; even among blacks, there is a new and vibrant diversity of opinion on the subject. Yet so far no one has questioned the very premises of the discussion. The basic assumption of our current racial debate is still that racism is the theory and discrimination is the practice. Racism is said to be based on ``prejudices,'' which constitute judgments made in the absence of evidence, and ``stereotypes,'' which are grossly misleading generalizations about groups. The obvious solutions, promoted by Martin Luther King and other activists, were twofold: statutes intended to outlaw racial discrimination, and social and educational programs to increase interaction between groups. As whites regularly lived and worked with blacks, their attitudes and actions toward them were expected to undergo a transformation, as ignorant prejudices gave way to enlightened acceptance.
<P>
As a result of these policies, state-sponsored segregation is dead; overt and arbitrary racial discrimination has greatly abated; white attitudes have undergone a revolutionary transformation in favor of equal rights in employment, housing, voting, and education; and there is a large and thriving black middle class. Yet, at the same time, the prevailing civil-rights model, and the laws and policies based on it, now seem irrelevant to contemporary problems, such as the lurid sufferings of the underclass, which have worsened over the past few decades. Consequently the debate seems to have been polarized and stalled by the crosscurrents of white backlash, black rage, and liberal despair. African American scholar Derrick Bell conveys some of the regnant frustration: ``We have made progress in everything, yet nothing has changed.''
<P>
Perhaps one way to gain an enlarged perspective on our current situation is to step back and turn our assumptions into questions. Are there circumstances in which discrimination actually makes sense? Are people who discriminate against people of other races by definition racist? Might prejudices reflect not ignorant predisposition but prudent judgment?
<P><P> 
<font size=+3>T</font><font size=+1>HE</font> problems with the prevailing civil-rights paradigm become evident when we examine the most widely cited contemporary example of racial discrimination -- the refusal of many taxidrivers to pick up young African-American males. In a recent article, Gregory Wright commented in the <I>Washington Post</I>:
<P>
<blockquote>
As an African American, I am fed up with having to flag down five cabs before finding one that will take me home, fed up with feeling anger, embarrassment, and frustration when cabdrivers swear they are off-duty and then pick up a white customer before I can get around the corner. Taxidrivers, many of whom come from Africa, the Caribbean, and the Middle East, say they don't want to pick up African-American passengers because they are afraid of being robbed, assaulted, or murdered. One Nigerian cabdriver told me he only picks up African Americans who are well dressed and look like businessmen. For African Americans, this discrimination can be inconvenient and downright humiliating.</blockquote>
<P>

It is easy to sympathize with the indignation expressed at such flagrant acts of racial discrimination. Yet according to Wright's own account, many of the cabdrivers who are reluctant to pick up young African-American males are themselves African, Caribbean, or Middle Eastern.  Moreover, the Nigerian cited by Wright says explicitly that he will pick up blacks who are suitably dressed. His discrimination seems to be based not simply on skin color but on other aspects of appearance.
<P>
During my travels I took up the issue with a number of taxidrivers in New York, Washington, Chicago, and other cities. Most of them denied that they refuse to pick up every black male, and all ridiculed the notion that cabdrivers pass up black women. But many groused that African-American passengers frequently leave no tip and sometimes beat the fare, and virtually all acknowledged that as a consequence of previous threats, robberies, and assaults they employ a kind of heightened scrutiny before they will stop for a young black man.
<P>
``This racism stuff is all bull --  -- ,'' one African student who was driving to put himself through school, told me. ``I'm not going to pass up a fare, which is money in my pocket. But I don't want to get robbed. You know what the black crime rate is in New York? Do you want me to risk a gun to my head, man? What's wrong with you?''
<P>
A white driver in Chicago told me, ``No exceptions, pal. I never pick up niggers.''
<P>
``You don't like blacks?'' I asked.
<P>
``Not blacks. Niggers.''
<P>
``That sounds like racism to me.''
<P>
``Hey, that's c---- . I pick up older blacks all the time. I have no problem with giving black women a ride. My black buddies won't pick up no niggers. I ain't no more racist than they are.''
<P>
These concerns seem to be borne out by cabdriver muggings and killings. In August 1994, Keith Moore, a 38-year-old cabdriver and single father, was found with the keys in the ignition and two bullet wounds in his head. His friends told the <I>Washington Post</I> that he never worried about picking up passengers in questionable neighborhoods no matter what the time of day. If Moore had exercised prudence, his colleague Louis Richardson said, he probably would be alive today. The U.S. Labor Department recently reported that driving a cab is the riskiest job in America, with occupational homicide rates higher than those for bartenders, gas-station attendants, and policemen.
<P>
These facts suggest how hollow it sounds to accuse cabdrivers of ``prejudice'' and ``stereotypes.'' While we can be sure that racist taxidrivers would discriminate, not all taxidrivers who discriminate are racist.
<P>
<P>
<font size=+3>M</font><font size=+1>ICHELLE</font> Joo, an Asian-American shopkeeper in Washington, D.C., acknowledges that she discriminates based on race. When deciding whether to let people into her jewelry and cosmetics store, she tells the <I>Washington Post</I>, ``I look at the face.'' She won't open the door ``if he looks ugly, if he's holding a bottle in a paper bag, if he's dirty. . . . If some guy looks kind, I let him in.'' Young black men are kept out if they seem rowdy, Miss Joo says. Usually they react by banging on her glass windows. One may say that Michelle Joo has no fixed policy of keeping blacks out. Nor does she have a quota about the number she will admit. Rather, she seems to be a prudent statistician. She employs race as one factor, but not the only factor, in her decision-making. As a means to ensure her security and business survival, she is practicing what may be termed rational discrimination.
<P>
Thousands of other store owners in major cities make similar decisions every day. So do countless women -- black, white, Hispanic, and Asian -- who come across black males in circumstances they consider not entirely safe. Regardless of their general attitudes about civil rights, they do what they feel is necessary in each particular case. Shopkeepers scurry to the front of the store where they can monitor the exit. Female pedestrians may clutch their purse more tightly or cross the street if approached by one or more young black men. Sometimes people snap the locks on their car doors as African-American youths walk by.
<P>
The psychological toll of such reactions is high. If you are black, columnist William Raspberry says, it is unusual to find yourself treated as an individual, and to receive the kind of consideration that whites expect. In <I>The Rage of a Privileged Class</I>, Ellis Cose describes a typical justification for black rage: ``Why am I constantly treated as if I were a drug addict, a thief, or a thug?'' Many who echo these sentiments also question the basis for group judgments about blacks. Legal scholar Charles Ogletree argues that ``99 per cent of black people don't commit crimes.''
<P>
Blacks make up approximately 12 per cent of the nation's population. Yet according to Uniform Crime Reports, published annually by the FBI, blacks account for 39 per cent of those arrested for aggravated assault, 42 per cent of those arrested for weapons possession, 43 per cent of those arrested for rape, 55 per cent of those arrested for murder, and 61 per cent of those arrested for robbery. Even discounting for the possibility of some racial bias in criminal arrests, it seems clear that the average black person is between three and six times as likely to be arrested for a crime as the average white person.
<P>
Young black males are arrested and convicted of crimes at an astonishingly high rate. According to the Sentencing Project, a liberal advocacy group, about 25 per cent of young black men in America are in prison, on probation, or on parole on any given day. For whites, the figure is 6 per cent. In major cities, the figures for young black men are even higher.
<P>
Jesse Jackson acknowledged the cultural pathology of violence among inner-city blacks when he said, ``There is nothing more painful for me than to walk down the street and hear footsteps and start to think about robbery, and then see it's somebody white and feel relieved.'' Faced with immediate criticism from other black activists, Jackson hurried to ``clarify'' his views and deny that he meant what he said. But several African-American scholars have made the same point. Johnnetta Cole writes that among black women ``one of the most painful admissions I hear is: I am afraid of my own people.'' Given black crime rates, Howard University education professor Kenneth Tollett says, ``The statements we have called stereotypes in the past have become true.''
<P>
Personally I would be angry and upset if, as a law-abiding person, I were routinely treated as a criminal by taxidrivers, storekeepers, or pedestrians. Yet, equally predictably, taxidrivers, storekeepers, and women who clutch their purses or cross the street will attach little significance to such personal and historical sensitivities. Such people are unlikely to be intimidated by accusations of prejudice. For them, the charges are meaningless, because the prejudice is warranted. In this context, a bigot is simply a sociologist without credentials.
<P><P>
<font size=+3>I</font><font size=+1>T IS</font> now time to examine with fresh eyes the meaning of familiar terms such as prejudice and stereotype, which underlie the conventional liberal understanding of racism. African-American scholar Henry Louis Gates writes: ``Racism exists when one generalizes about attributes of an individual, and treats him or her accordingly.'' Gates offers some specific examples: ``You people sure can dance,'' and ``Black people play basketball so remarkably well.'' He concludes, ``These are racist statements.'' But are they?
<P>
In his classic work, <I>The Nature of Prejudice</I>, published in 1954, Gordon Allport drew on modern social-science theories to explicate the paradigm of liberal anti-racism.  Allport argued that prejudices and stereotypes reveal less about their objects than their subjects. Applying such concepts as displacement and frustration-aggression theory, Allport maintained that when people feel hostility and anger which they have difficulty coping with, they project it onto others, who thus become sacrificial victims or ``scapegoats.'' Allport helped to establish a premise that many social scientists continue to hold today: prejudices and stereotypes endure because of the principle of self-selection. From the distorted perspective of the racist, blacks who do not conform to preconceived notions simply do not exist; they are, in Ralph Ellison's term, invisible men.
<P>
For the better part of a generation, this liberal understanding of racism worked fairly well. The reason was that both whites and blacks had indeed developed many erroneous views about each other as a consequence of the social isolation produced by Southern segregation. During slavery the races stayed in regular, even intimate, contact, but after emancipation the forced separation of the races created a divided society in which dubious and even absurd generalizations could endure, unchecked by contrary experience. The civil-rights movement's assault on prejudices and stereotypes, as well as the experience of desegregation, helped to topple many such group generalizations that could not withstand empirical examination.
<P>
The problem with the liberal paradigm is its premise that <I>all</I> group perceptions are misperceptions. Paradoxically it is desegregation and integration which have called the liberal view into question. One of the risks of increased exposure to blacks is that it has placed whites in a position to discover which of their preconceived views are true.
<P>
In fact ethnic groups which have had little history of oppressing each other now seem to be formulating clear and often critical images of other groups. In one of the more remarkable surveys of recent years, the National Conference of Christians and Jews reports that many minority groups harbor much more hostile attitudes toward other minority groups than whites do. For example, 49 per cent of blacks and 68 per cent of Asians said that Hispanics ``tend to have bigger families than they can support.'' Forty-six per cent of Hispanics and 42 per cent of blacks agreed that Asian  Americans are ``unscrupulous, crafty, and devious in business.'' And 53 per cent of Asians and 51 per cent of Hispanics affirmed that blacks ``are more likely to commit crimes and violence.''
<P>
It is, of course, possible that these minority perceptions reveal that, by a kind of social osmosis, everyone is learning racism from whites. But if so, why would minority perceptions be stronger than those of whites who are the alleged racists par excellence? More likely, these intergroup minority perceptions are the product of experience. Most people today have fairly regular contact with others of different races, and have many opportunities to verify their collective judgments about other groups.
<P>
During my speaking trips to college campuses, I decided, as a journalistic exercise, to test people's perception of group traits by raising the question of whether stereotypes may be true and prejudices based on them therefore legitimate. Inevitably, I encountered strong emotional opposition. Educated people today have been taught to despise group generalizations. In a sense, we have been raised to be prejudiced against prejudice.
<P>
Recently on a West Coast campus, I raised the question of whether, as a group, ``blacks have rhythm.'' A professor of Afro-American Studies insisted, ``Absolutely not,'' and a number of white students readily agreed. Instinctively, they raised the familiar defenses, ``I know a black man who can't dance.'' ``How can you generalize about a group that is so diverse?'' ``What about Elvis? He had rhythm, and he wasn't black,'' and so on. I pointed out that these were poor refutations of a proposition that was being offered as true on average, or compared with the experience of other groups. One cannot rebut the statistically irrefutable statement that men on average are taller than women by producing a six-foot woman and a four-foot man. Those individuals would merely constitute exceptions to a general pattern that has persisted across cultures for most of recorded history.
<P>
Incidentally, the view that blacks tend to be more rhythmic than whites is no whimsical recent invention but is supported by observation and experience in several cultures over two millennia. In ancient Greece and Rome, which held no negative view of black skin color, Ethiopians and other blacks were celebrated for a perceived natural inclination to music and dance. This is a central theme of that segment of Greek and Roman art which focuses on blacks. Moreover, the same perception of blacks is evident in many Arab descriptions of African blacks written in the late Middle Ages. Ibn Butlan, for example, writes that if a black man was dropped from heaven ``he would beat time as he goes down.'' The Muslim historian Ibn Khaldun attributed the black African proclivity for music to the relaxing influence of the sun's heat.
<P>
On one point the liberal paradigm about group generalizations is sound: people's perceptions of others are always filtered through the lens of their own prior experience. But the liberal understanding cannot explain how particular traits come to be identified with particular groups. Only because group traits have an empirical basis in shared experience can we invoke them without fear of serious contradiction. Think how people would react if someone said, ``Koreans are lazy,'' or ``Hispanics are constantly trying to find ways to make money.'' Despite the prevalence of anti-Semitism, Jews are rarely accused of stupidity. Blacks are never accused of being tight with a dollar, or of conspiring to take over the world. By reversing stereotypes we can see how their persistence relies, not simply on the assumptions of the viewer, but also on the characteristics of the group being described.
<P>
This is no case for group traits having a biological foundation. Probably the vast majority of group traits are entirely cultural, the distilled product of many years of shared experience. Yet prejudices and stereotypes are not intended to explain the origins of group traits, only to take into account their existence. Nor is this an argument to emphasize negative traits. Stereotypes can be negative or positive. Indeed the same stereotype can be interpreted favorably or unfavorably. One can deplore Roman machismo or admire Roman manliness; deride Spanish superstition or exalt Spanish piety; ridicule English severity or cherish English self-control. In each of these interpretations, we see a single set of facts, a different set of values.
<P>
William Helmreich, in <I>The Things They Say Behind Your Back</I>, takes up the issue of whether there is a rational basis for group stereotypes. Helmreich finds some stereotypes that are clearly false. During the Middle Ages, for example, apparently many Christians took religious polemic literally and came to believe that Jews have horns. Clearly this was not a perception destined to last: one has only to encounter a few Jews to discover that they do not, in fact, possess horns.
<P>
Helmreich takes up other stereotypes, however, such as the view that many Nobel laureates are Jewish, or that the Mafia is largely made up of Italians, or that the Japanese tend to be xenophobic and nationalistic, or that many Irishmen and American Indians drink enormous quantities of alcohol. Basically Helmreich finds that these perceptions are confirmed by the data. Of all the stereotypes he considers, Helmreich concludes that ``almost half the stereotypes have a strong factual basis.''
<P>
Thus the liberal assumptions that groups do not differ and that group generalizations are irrational turn out to be wrong. Indeed they generate a civil-rights paradigm which is at variance with most people's direct observation of the world. We would do better to acknowledge the reality of group traits and ask how we should act on it.

<font size=+3>R</font><font size=+1>ATIONAL</font> discrimination is not limited to the exasperating but relatively inconsequential actions of taxidrivers and storekeepers; it is also quite pervasive in other areas, notably hiring.
<P>
In one of the most famous demonstrations of the persistence of hiring discrimination, in 1991 the Urban Institute sent ten black and ten white testers to apply for a range of private-sector jobs in Chicago and Washington, D.C. The testers were matched in pairs with very similar appearances, deportments, and credentials. The Institute found that in 67 per cent of cases neither candidate received a job offer; in 13 per cent, both did; in 15 per cent, only the white tester received an offer; and in 5 per cent, only the black tester did.
<P>
Although these results hardly prove, as the Institute concluded, that racial discrimination against blacks is ``widespread and entrenched,'' they do suggest that it continues to exist. Curiously, however, the Institute study found that white and black employers were equally likely to discriminate. This suggests the possibility that discrimination persists because in some cases it is efficient; it makes economic sense.
<P>
Conventional economic theory holds that arbitrary racial discrimination is economically costly. The reason was explained years ago by economist Gary Becker: employers who refuse to hire the best person for the job are likely to suffer relative to their competition. Even discrimination based on arbitrary features such as race can be profitable, however, when the cost of discrimination is lower than the transaction cost of evaluating candidates individually.
<P>
Consider the case of a chain of stores seeking to hire entry-level workers recruited mainly from the local high-school. Let us assume, further, that African Americans as a group have substantially higher crime rates than whites, Hispanics, or Asians. Employers could disregard this fact and carefully scrutinize the individual history and character of each applicant. This would certainly be the ideal course of action. But employers, who are in business to make a profit, may reason that entry-level jobs do not warrant the expenditure of time and effort to investigate every applicant's personal history. The employer may save transaction costs by simply keeping the number of blacks hired to a minimum.
<P>
That the discrimination unearthed by the Urban Institute study was probably rational is suggested by its finding that the race of the interviewer showed no correlation with the likelihood of engaging in discrimination. Discrimination practiced equally by white and black employers is likely to be discrimination that does not depend on racist intentions, but rather applies the logic of predictive evaluation, discriminating against people in high-risk categories. Race is not being singled out here: employers may have similar rational reasons for their reluctance to hire women, who may get pregnant and leave, or the elderly, who are more likely to fall ill, or young people, who may prove less reliable as employees.
<P>
In Chicago, one of the sites of the Urban Institute study, Joleen Kirschenman and Kathryn Neckerman interviewed employers about their motives for hiring and found support for the rational-discrimination hypothesis.<br>

 -- In general, one construction-company owner said, for urban blacks ``the quality of education is not as great as white folk from the suburbs, and it shows.''<br>
 -- Another employer remarked, ``The Polish immigrants that I know are more highly motivated than the Hispanics.''<br>
 -- One manufacturer said, ``We are not shutting out any black specifically, but I will say that our experience has been bad.''<P>
The authors conclude that employers are using race as a proxy for ``aspects of productivity that are relatively expensive or impossible to measure.'' Many employers do seem to recognize diversity among blacks, often describing a particular individual as a good prospect, ``the exception to the rule.'' Nevertheless, employers do use group generalizations, so that in Kirschenman and Neckerman's view, ``black job applicants, unlike their white counterparts, must indicate to employers that the stereotypes do not apply to them.''
<P>
Rational discrimination may be difficult to understand in hiring, yet its economic justification is obvious in other areas. Insurance companies, for example, have no special dislike for teenage boys, but they charge them higher rates than female and older drivers. This is very unfair to an individual teenage boy who is a skilled and cautious driver, because he is penalized on account of the statistical habits of a group he did not voluntarily join. Yet even with reasonably thorough personal information, companies are not in a good position to predict individual behavior.
<P>
<font size=+3>I</font><font size=+1>S</font> discrimination based on race necessarily racist? Not if you define racism as a doctrine of intrinsic superiority and inferiority, which leads to judgments against a group on grounds of biology rather than conduct. Indeed, the existence of rational discrimination compels us to revise the liberal paradigm which holds that racism is the theory and discrimination is the practice. The two may be unconnected. It is possible to be a racist and not discriminate: this would be true of many poor and marginalized whites who might hate blacks and consider them inferior, but who are not in a position to enforce their convictions. So too it is possible to discriminate and not be a racist: this would constitute rational discrimination.
<P>
Just because discrimination can be rational, however, does not mean that it is always moral. When individuals and companies make decisions not to go to great lengths to ensure that they are not misjudging any particular person, they are sacrificing the just treatment of individuals at the altar of security, convenience, or profits. Even though such judgments may be prudent and realistic, they are not, strictly speaking, fair. Rational discrimination based on unalterable traits is problematic in a way that discrimination against high-school dropouts and convicted felons is not.
<P>
Thus the question of whether rational discrimination should be legal is a real one. The new public-policy dilemma is based on the recognition that discrimination sometimes makes practical sense, and that such discrimination forces a choice in which the claims of morality are on one side, and the claims of rationality and productivity are on the other.
<P>
We have, in fact, three models of how to deal with the persistence of discrimination. The first is affirmative action. Some advocates, such as legal scholar David Strauss, argue that racial preferences are an essential remedy for rational discrimination. Yet this argument is specious. After all, rational discrimination is objectionable because it treats competent individuals as incompetent on account of their involuntary membership in a disfavored group. This is hardly remedied by racial preferences which treat comparatively incompetent individuals as competent on account of their membership in a favored group.
<P>
The second approach is to make all discrimination, including rational discrimination, illegal in the public and private sector. This was Martin Luther King's solution, and it remains attractive to most Americans. Yet such a solution, although a vast improvement over the current system of racial preferences, would require massive state intervention in the private sector to unmask and punish discriminators, including minority firms which prefer to hire members of their own group, and other employers whose only sin amounts to engaging in rational behavior.
<P>
Then there is a third, and venerable option which was once considered liberal, but which has been virtually forgotten. In a free society, which maintains a distinction between the private and public sphere, rational discrimination is far more problematic when perpetrated by institutions of government than by private individuals and institutions. The reason is that in a democracy the government is responsible to all its citizens, who have a right to demand that they be treated as individuals equally under the law. Thus a new option emerges: the government should be strictly race-neutral, but private actors would be free to discriminate. In this scenario, rational discrimination would be legal, and so would private-sector affirmative action.
<P>
I can already hear the gasps of civil-rights activists, who are so wedded to the paradigm of old struggles that they cannot see what is obvious to the generation born after the civil-rights movement: Bull Connor is dead, and the <I>ancien r&#233gime</I> is finished. True, there will be employers who will refuse to hire blacks, and some may even post signs that say ``No African Americans Need Apply.'' So what? Irrational discrimination of this sort is harmful only when it is comprehensive in scope -- when everyone discriminates. On the other hand, if only some employers discriminate, then competitive markets impose the main financial cost of discrimination on the discriminator, where it belongs.
<P>
Thus we arrive at a supreme irony: perhaps the best way to save affirmative action is to abolish the civil-rights laws, or rather, to limit their employment provisions to government conduct. This would be not a repudiation of the civil-rights movement but its natural fulfillment. Only such a bold strategy establishes a framework of state-neutrality and personal freedom that permits citizens of all backgrounds to pursue their competing utopias, and offers a realistic way out of our current thicket.

<LI>Do people, and the businesses they form, have a presumptive right to the money they earn? Or do they get to keep some portion of it only as a favor from the Federal Government? That's the question at issue in a dispute over the meaning of the term ``corporate welfare'' -- and astonishingly enough, the usually sound conservative Rep. Bill Archer (R., Tex.) is on the wrong side of it. The chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee wants to eliminate about sixty business tax preferences over the next seven years to help balance the budget. But to end a tax break without reducing tax rates amounts to a tax increase -- which, political junkies might recall, Republicans are supposed to be against. If Congress really wants to attack ``corporate welfare,'' it should abolish the Export - Import Bank, agribusiness subsidies, and tariffs. Giving other people's money to select businesses is welfare; letting them keep more of their own is not.

<p>

<LI>House Republican efforts to dismantle the Legal Services Corporation (LSC) are in danger of falling victim to the McCollum syndrome, an illness marked by the eager willingness to accept half-a-loaf legislation that afflicts the chronically behind-the-curve Florida Republican. Bill McCollum, joined by Judiciary Committee Democrats, failed in his bid to scrap at the committee level a proposal by George Gekas (R., Pa.) to block-grant LSC funds to the states. But McCollum did succeed in increasing funding for LSC and stretching it out over several years. Conservatives rightly consider this a betrayal of the deal the House leadership cut earlier this year to end LSC funding after two years. McCollum explains: ``The very essence of being a conservative is a desire to preserve the underpinnings of the democratic system, and this [the LSC] is one of them.'' The House leadership hopes to strip the weakening amendments out of the legislation on the floor. Senator Phil Gramm, meanwhile, managed to get a tough Gekas-like bill out of committee, but faces a possible stiff challenge on the Senate floor (perhaps led by Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici). The upshot of all this may eventually be that the LSC gets the axe. But in Washington these days nothing pays like revolutionary skepticism.

<LI>From a shoebox in Pat Robertson's garage to a 1.7-million-member organization. From political outcasts  -- ``poor, uneducated, easy to command,'' as the <I>Washington Post</I> once put it -- to presidential kingmakers. The Christian Coalition celebrated a political passage at its annual ``Road to Victory'' conference in Washington. All the GOP presidential candidates -- except Pete Wilson and the uninvited Arlen Specter -- were there to tout their social-conservative credentials. And Robertson could quote a recent article describing the Coalition as the dominant force in 18 state Republican parties -- and counting. ``We have gained what we have always sought,'' declared Executive Director Ralph Reed. ``A place at the table.'' The transformation of evangelical Protestants into a powerful, impossible-to-ignore electoral bloc -- by one estimate the Coalition mobilized 4 million activists and 50 million voters last year -- will keep ``the culture'' front and center in American politics. Of course some fear the GOP's becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Pat Robertson -- a groundless fear when Catholics, Jews, non-evangelical Protestants, and hard-headed agnostics account for more than half of the <I>conservative</I> coalition. Perhaps a more likely danger is the Christian Coalition's becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of a GOP which will not always behave as the Coalition would like. A place at the table is worth having only if on occasion you can walk away from it.

<LI>A new nationwide poll conducted by Adams Research for <I>Talk Daily</I> flattens the media myth that talk-radio listeners are rednecks and morons. The survey finds that listeners have higher annual incomes than the national average, are twice as likely to be college graduates, and are politically active (92 per cent are registered voters). A whopping two-thirds of listeners regard talk radio as an ``important source of political information and ideas.'' And they're everywhere: one in six Americans has listened to Rush et al. in the last 48 hours, three out of ten in the past week. Such talk is music to our ears.

<LI>One advantage the Left has long enjoyed is its ability to get funds coercively, in the form of tax dollars and compulsory union dues. Since last year's elections, taxpayer funds have permitted the advocacy Left (e.g., groups like the National Council of Senior Citizens, 90 per cent federally funded) to fight the new majority's agenda on the balanced budget, Medicare savings, and welfare reform. Conservative freshmen in the House are eager to strip the Left of that advantage. Their vehicle is the Istook - McIntosh - Ehrlich amendment, an appropriations rider that would prohibit non-profit organizations that receive federal grants from spending more than 5 per cent of their budgets on lobbying. Liberal special interests have fought back ferociously, enlisting prestigious organizations like the YMCA, the March of Dimes, and the American Red Cross to lead the battle. And the strategy has worked with liberal Republicans, to the extent that Arlen Specter stripped the rider out of the HHS/Labor appropriations bill, and Mark Hatfield and James Jeffords are resisting efforts to attach it to the Treasury/Postal appropriations bill. Now, however, scores of freshmen have indicated that they will vote against the bill unless it includes the rider. The House leadership may not understand this freshman intransigence. The people back home will.

<LI>Democrats were indignant when Republicans issued a ``Wanted'' poster with pictures of Democratic politicians, including many women and minorities. Now Majority '96, a Democratic group, has compiled a list of 33 House seats it's targeting in the next election, including those of Gary Franks, Andrea Seastrand, Linda Smith, Helen Chenoweth, and J. C. Watts. That's one-fifth of the Republican women (and almost half the conservative women) in Congress, and 100 per cent of the black Republicans. A coincidence, we're sure.

<LI>House leaders traditionally refrain from making presidential-primary endorsements.

<LI>It was the first rumpus of the Age of Newt. After being sworn in as Speaker, Mr. Gingrich appointed Christina Jeffrey, a former colleague from Georgia academic life, to be House Historian. Democrats spotted a critical 1986 review she had written of ``Facing History and Ourselves,'' a Holocaust-education program for schools. It took a lot of selective quotation to turn Mrs. Jeffrey's critique into evidence of anti-Semitism and Nazi sympathy, but Reps. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.) and Barney Frank (D., Mass.) were up to the task. Gingrich buckled under the barrage -- though subsequently, he showed the courage and the decency to regret publicly his loss of nerve. Now Abraham H. Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, has declared that the ADL is ``satisfied that any characterization of [Mrs. Jeffrey] as anti-Semitic or sympathetic to Nazism is entirely unfounded and unfair'' -- a creditable statement. He also accepted her invitation to co-sponsor a conference on Holocaust education at Kennesaw State College in Georgia, where she now teaches. No sign yet from Messrs. Schumer and Frank -- who slandered an innocent woman and exploited a catastrophe in order to score political brownie points -- that they have faced this bit of history, or themselves.

<LI>Who's the richest one of all? Australians, according to a new study by the World Bank, are worth an average of $835,000 per capita, putting them at the top of the heap. The U.S., at $421,000 per capita, ranks a mere 12th, behind such stellar performers as Iceland, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. The catch? Along with income and man-made wealth, these figures include the value of a nation's untapped natural resources, i.e., all the outback gold and silver or Gulf oil available to future generations. But how valuable will those resources be to someone a hundred years from now? When measured relative to wages, the prices of natural resources today are half what they were in 1980, and only one-eighth what they were in 1900. Real oil prices dropped 62 per cent between 1980 and 1992. Food is 49 per cent cheaper. Prices of most resources shoot up during wars or when the government imposes price controls, but quickly fall again when markets are allowed to allocate resources freely. The Greens have it all wrong: countries that husband natural resources will become ever less wealthy relative to those that turn them into something useful. We'd short Iceland and go long on the United States.

How else to explain David Aaron's cable stating that his entire staff of 44 at the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is essential? His assertion is remarkable considering that no one knows exactly what the OECD does. Aaron's cable explains that fall is the busiest season at the OECD (just like the fashion industry).

It isn't that Roseanne is gross -- no surprise from an editorial regime that, among (many) other horrors, put a crucified Easter bunny on one cover. The reason folks feel Tina Brown's time is up is that Roseanne is pass&#233. She has been gracing the pages of People and The National Enquirer for the better part of a decade. And yet, Tina Brown just discovered her. Fatal, for the High Priestess of Now. The New Yorker, whatever its ideological short-circuits, was once a beacon of urbanity and style. Those are different from hype and hip, as Miss Brown is at long last learning.

<HR>
<P>
NEW YORK, SEPTEMBER 5
<P>








It was wise of Senator Dole to come down on English as the national language when he was firing away over the weekend at anti-U.S. academics. The movement to make English the official language of the United States is making legislative headway. The State of New Hampshire has just now enacted an English-language bill, and what appeals to New Hampshire, beyond apples, tends to appeal to presidential candidates.
<P>
The principal lobbying group in favor of universalizing English (it is called ``U.S. English'') is ironically headed up by someone whose native language wasn't English (he is Mauro E. Mujica). And of course the heftiest warrior for English was the late senator and semanticist S. I. Hayakawa, whose native language was Japanese. Senator Hayakawa wanted nothing less than a constitutional amendment. U.S. English will settle for less; others want more.
<P>
There is of course the other side. Why does the United States have to have a common language? After all, Switzerland doesn't.
<P>
The first thing to learn about Switzerland is never to invoke what happens there in an effort to prove any point about any other country. Switzerland breaks all the rules, gets away with it; is a wonderful country with, unhappily, a bad drug problem.
<P>
There are very good historical reasons why the French should have been permitted to nourish their language in Canada and, more recently, to insist on the recognition of French as a substitute language in everything from ballot forms to road signs. But every now and again Canada threatens to become two nations, and so reminds us of the burden the British would have been spared if, two hundred years ago, they had, after defeating the French, exported them back to France, or else sent them south to the United States, where immigrants were taught English.
<P>
Opponents of the universalization of English use two arguments. The first is multiculturalist in ideology, the second, a <I>faux</I> cosmopolitanism. There is every reason in the world for the schools in the United States to teach foreign languages, beginning with Spanish, which is progressively important in commerce and hemispheric comity. But hanging onto one's Spanish if that is the native language is entirely different from depending on it.
<P>
It makes sense in addressing the issue to close our eyes to what happens with the first generation. Yes, many immigrants -- perhaps millions -- who arrived here in middle age went on to become conversant with English. But millions did not, and will not, and it is an expression of geniality to give them radio and television and newspapers in Spanish.
<P>
But their children need to be treated differently. I have experienced a 15-year-old boy who speaks English with difficulty even though he has lived in New York City with his mother for five years. It turns out that in public school, before he moved to a parochial school where he now studies, young Saul was taught six classes every day, five of them in Spanish.
<P>
The quarrel is between two camps, one of them, so to speak, total immersion in its approach, the second a little looser. There are those who believe that English can only be rapidly mastered if every foreigner is required to use it when engaged in any transaction over which that person is superintended. Thus, for instance, employees at McDonald's would be required to talk to each other in English while on-premise. One way to generalize this approach is that everywhere you're not permitted to smoke, you are permitted to speak only in English.
<P>
The approach of U.S. English is less draconian, so also is the House bill introduced by Representative Bill Emerson. It would enforce the use only of English in all government communications, forms, ballots, whatever. Mr. Emerson's bill has 180 sponsors, and in a previous version had also as sponsor Newt Gingrich, who endorses enthusiastically the notion of a national language, nationally accepted as such.
<P>
It is really quite cruel to go in the other direction. A few years ago a middle-aged woman told me that when her parents were sent to Moscow they plunked her down in a Russian school. ``I cried every day for about a month and in about six weeks I understood everything that was said in Russian.'' To stand in the way of young people devoting themselves to the English language is on the order of encouraging obesity by cramming them with Mars bars. It is surely the case that every immigrant who can now handle English is grateful for the experience even if it meant crawling through gnarled, spiky, thorny brushwood for a few months or years.

Dear Rusty

<P>



You'll never guess who I met last week! Hint: he dresses in robes, speaks in a foreign accent, and has been reincarnated 17 times. Give up? I gave Tipper the same clues, but after she guessed ``Henry Kissinger,'' she lost interest in the game.
<P>
Okay, I'll tell you: the Dalai Lama! That's right! The Lama himself was right in my office, and let me tell you, we had a great conversation. He has a real ``presence,'' if you will -- you can tell at once that he's a religious man, and not just because of the robes and the bald head and the incense, either. His eyes are very wise, in a non-Western way. And the way he kept murmuring, ``We need more money,'' had a distinctly spiritual ring to it.
<P>
You're probably wondering how this all came about. Well, with Mrs. William Jefferson Clinton in Beijing, at the UN Women's Tribunal, a lot of us in Washington thought we should do something publicly to denounce the repressive regime in Beijing. But since we've been doing that for a couple of years now, and it hasn't seemed to work -- I mean, they're all still in power over there (though I hear that Deng smokes two packs of unfiltered Camels every day, and has since he was 17 years old, so he'll be lucky to see his 97th birthday) -- someone over at State thought it would be smart to consult with an expert. And who knows better how to deal with the Chinese than the Dalai, who's been on the run since the late '50s?
<P> 
Anyway, besides you and my daughter Karenna, I don't really know any practicing Buddhists, so I was a little nervous about the meeting. Plus, Tipper, Sara, and Kristin insisted on being part of the formal greeting party, ``in case he brings Richard Gere,'' so the office was crowded. 
<P>
Yet he instantly put us at ease. He sort of glided into the room -- a big robe and flip-flops has that effect -- sipped a glass of iced tea, and smiled. Tip and the girls left quickly -- no Richard Gere, just a few monks -- and the Dalai and I got down to talking. ``Welcome to Washington,'' I said. 
<P>
``Thank you, Mr. Vice President. You know, your office looks remarkably like the set they're using on Oliver Stone's movie Nixon.''
<P>
``Really? I didn't know that,'' I said.
<P> 
``Oh yeah. Oliver's pretty much a detail person. I just visited with him. I flew in on the red-eye.''
<P> 
``Oh.''
<P> 
``Can I get a slice of lemon in this tea?''
<P> 
``Of course, of course,'' I said, and sent an usher out to get a tray of lemons.
<P> 
``So, Mr. Vice President,'' the Lama continued, ``as you know, the Chinese have been occupying my nation of Tibet for almost half a century. Theirs is a brutal and violent reign.'' 
<P>
``Yes, we know. But you see, Dalai Lama, we're having a hard time deciding on a policy.''
<P> 
``Any chance of a cigarette?''
<P> 
``I'm sorry, your Holiness, but there's no smoking in the White House.''
<P> 
``Not even for a reincarnated holy man?'' 
<P>
He had a point, Rusty -- and since the enforcer of the ``No Smoking'' rule was in Beijing I sent another usher out for Marlboro 100s and a light.
<P> 
``So,'' I continued, ``do you have any suggestions as to how to proceed with our relationship with Beijing? How we can stop the violence against your people?'' 
<P>
The Lama thought about this. ``I'm not sure,'' he finally murmured. ``We've been fighting them for generations -- well, not fighting, since we're non-violent and we advocate non-violence for others -- but we've been pressuring them and pressuring them, and so far, with no result.''
<P> 
``Hey, same here,'' I said. ``But you know, the First Lady is in Beijing right now. Just yesterday they passed a law against sex-based wage inequities, so if we keep our fingers crossed, they might get to the whole Tibet situation before the Tribunal disbands.''
<P>
An usher dashed into the office. Apparently, no one in the White House would admit to having cigarettes -- they suspected some sort of trap, it seems -- so the usher had to race down a couple of blocks to the liquor store. He was mugged.
<P> 
``I'm sorry, Dalai Lama, but I'm afraid we won't be able to offer you a cigarette. But if we could get back to the violence in your homeland . . .''
<P>
``I wish we could. Unfortunately, I'm due for dinner in Manhattan with Richard Gere. If I leave right now I can snag the three o'clock shuttle.''
<P> 
As the Dalai left my office, an aide handed me an urgent cable. Mrs. William Jefferson Clinton and the delegation at the UN Women's Tribunal in Beijing had just voted to outlaw male aggression, which, if broadly defined, might include things like the Chinese invasion of Tibet. So at least there was some good news to celebrate.

<LI><B>Bob Dole</B> hits first downdraft in nomination bid in Ames, Iowa, straw poll. 
<I>Newsweek</I> notes: ``Dole's campaign has stumbled whenever he's ventured beyond
 his familiar Senate lair,'' warns campaign ``may be only one misstep away 
 from the kind of shake-ups [Dole] has engineered in the past,'' although for
  moment campaign manager Scott Reed and deputy manager <B>Bill Lacy</B> are ``safe.'' . . .<B> Bob Novak</B> reports conservative Dole advisor
  <B> Don Devine</B> being pushed aside. . . . Campaign ignited mini-firestorm by returning $1,000 check from Log Cabin Republicans, a gay 
   group. Log Cabin executive director <B>Richard Tafel</B> says Dole campaign solicited money, then, post Ames, ``basically figured they 
   could write off the gays because they need the right wing.'' <I>San Francisco Chronicle</I> editorial headline: ``The Dole Way: If You're 
   Down, Kick a Gay.'' . . . A <B>Pete Wilson </B>aide suggests a new Iowa strategy for Bob Dole: replace Scott Reed with<B> Ralph
   Reed</B>. 
   New Southern strategy? Replace <B>Sheila Burke</B> with <B>Delta Burke</B>. . . . Dole drops 7 points, from 42 to 35 per cent, in Time/CNN poll.
    Undecided column picks up the slack, jumping to 25 per cent. Rest of field in single digits. . . . Pete Wilson announces
     presidential bid -- again -- hits illegal immigration, affirmative action in speech with Statue of Liberty as backdrop. 
     (<B>Mario Cuomo</B> suggests changing inscription to ``Let us send back your tired, your poor, your huddled masses.'') . . . 
     <B>Lamar Alexander</B> campaign runs New Hampshire radio ads highlighting Wilson's former support for tax increases, affirmative
      action, scores California governor as ``political chameleon.'' . . . Continuing buzz around possible independent candidacies.
      <I> The New Yorker's</I> <B>Hendrik Hertzberg</B>, noting <B>Ross Perot</B> won 19 per cent after he ``had spectacularly proved his unfitness,'' 
       asks: Could a <B>Colin Powell - Bill Bradley</B> ticket win? ``There is every reason to think so.'' . . . <I>Wall Street
       Journal</I> reports 
       Pentagon is ``immune to the hype'' surrounding Powell. Senior officers criticize ``Powell doctrine'' -- military interventions 
       should only be undertaken with overwhelming force -- as too risk-averse. . . . <B>George Will</B> on Powell: his views on the centrality 
       of racism and the unequal distribution of wealth ``are shared by millions of good citizens. They are called Democrats.'' . . . 
       In Dole - <B>Clinton</B> race Colin Powell comes in at 27 per cent, both Perot and Bradley at roughly 17. . . . Documentary ``Inside the Republican Revolution,'' produced by conservative Michael Pack and hosted by Donald Lambro of Washington Times, airs nationally on PBS on September 13.

<LI>Presence of New Jersey ex-Gov. <B>Tom Kean</B> (R.) in official delegation to Peking 
conference on women supposed to make U.S. representation ``bi-partisan.'' But 
rest of delegation consists of Clinton officials; non-government delegates include <B>Marilyn Monahan</B>, 
secretary-treasurer of National Education Association, and <B>Marie C. Wilson</B>, president of the Ms. Foundation for 
Women. . . . <I>Wall Street Journal's</I><B> Al Hunt</B> debunks conservative assault on draft agenda by noting word ``mother'' appears 
13 times. But Independent Women's Forum head <B>Barbara Ledeen</B> notes most of those references are disparaging. 
(IWF distributes buttons: ``Sex Is Better than Gender.'') . . . Chinese restricted demonstrations in connection with 
conference to a special area in school yard. Demonstrations ``should not slander or attack leaders of the host country,'' 
explained one official. . . . Delegate <B>Lynn Cutler</B> tells <I>Washington Post's</I><B> Judy Mann</B>, ``The more light that you put on these
 issues . . . the more you help drive home the point that there are inequities here that must be addressed.'' President Clinton 
 announces task force to implement plans arising from conference. . . . Government advice to Chinese police officers, hotel desk
  clerks, or others who might encounter naked woman protesting at Peking conference: Throw a white sheet or coat over her. Taxi 
  drivers urged not to pick up naked women in their cabs.

<LI>Subcomandante <B>Marcos</B>, Mexico's masked rebel-by-press-conference, is angling for a left-wing political party, leaning heavily on 
Liberationist Catholic support, especially Bishop <B>Samuel Ruiz</B> of San Cristobal de las Casas. But a ``referendum'' on future of his 
group turned out less than 3 per cent of eligible voters. . . . Mexican Pres. <B>Ernesto Zedillo de Leon</B> is trying, with $2-billion 
bailout, to head off a ``debtors' strike'' by 7.5 million credit-card holders, cutting interest rates by as much as 45 per cent 
in a 13-month restructuring period. . . . Tough-talking <B>Ryutaro Hashimoto</B>, MITI minister who faced down Clinton Administration trade 
negotiator <B>Mickey Kantor</B> on autos, heads for leadership of Liberal Democratic Party (Japan's largest party) and possibly the prime 
ministership. Foreign Minister <B>Yohei Kono</B>, chief spokesman for conservative reformers, withdrew, faced with certain defeat. . . . Recent
 deployment of new super-quiet nuclear-armed subs off U.S. East coast ``may have been intended as a reminder of Russia's residual 
 power,'' according to former Pentagon official <B>Robert J. Murray</B>; Russian sub force will be 15 per cent larger than American in 
 year 2000. . . . <B>Gen. Aleksandr Lebed</B>, former commander of 14th army in Moldova, will run for Russian Duma in December elections, 
 with polls showing him beating <B>Boris Yeltsin</B> 38 to 8 in subsequent presidential elections.

<P>
The Little Engine that Couldn't
<P>
STEPHEN MOORE
<P>
Mr. Moore is director of fiscal-policy studies at the Cato Institute.

<P>
WASHINGTON, D.C.
<P>
ON December 21, 1987, the Democrat-controlled Congress wrapped
13 appropriations bills into a $600-billion, 1,400-page omnibus
spending bill, dumped it on President Reagan's desk, and then
adjourned. Reagan's unhappy options: sign into law the most expensive
spending bill in the history of Western civilization or veto it
and set in motion a Christmas Eve budget train wreck. In the end,
Reagan blinked (thanks to advice from Jim and Howard Baker), the
bill was signed, and House Speaker Jim Wright and Senate Majority
Leader Robert Byrd were exalted. It was perhaps the low point
of the Reagan Presidency.
<P>
There's a useful, if painful, lesson here for Newt Gingrich and
Co. as they prepare to go mano-a-mano with Bill Clinton to decide
the fate of the GOP fiscal revolution. Throughout the 1980s, congressional
Democrats played fiscal hardball with the White House; they played
to win, and invariably did. They routinely used the threat of
a budget train wreck as a strategic offensive weapon in policy
disputes with Reagan. Most importantly, they almost never blinked
first.
<P>
Will the Republicans? One thing seems certain about the looming
budget fight: if this GOP Congress has anywhere near the fierce
loyalty to its agenda of shrinking the government that Jim Wright
and the Democratic leadership of the 1980s had to their agenda
of expanding it, conservatives will score a resounding victory
by early November. The balanced-budget blueprint, the family and
economic-growth tax cuts, the dismantling of failed Great Society
social programs, the Medicare fix, and the real end to welfare
as we know it -- every one of these long-sought conservative goals
will be achieved in full. As veteran budget analyst Harrison Fox
of Citizens for Budget Reform has put it: ``All that can prevent
total victory is Republicans themselves.'' However, if Republicans
remain unflinchingly committed to the budget revolution that won
them 50 House and 8 Senate seats last November, the White House
will almost assuredly fold like a cheap dime-store tent. Let's
not forget this isn't Clint Eastwood in the Oval Office, it's
just Bill Clinton. 
<P>
Even if Clinton vetoes Republican budgets, he still can't conceivably
force concessions from a unified Republican House and Senate.
Remember, Clinton's beef with Congress is that it's not spending
enough money. (We're talking about a GOP budget of $1.6 trillion,
more money than is spent by all of the Fortune 500 companies combined.
Even if Republicans have their way, spending will still rise by
an enormous $350 billion over the next seven years. This is hardly
scorched-earth fiscal policy.) Since the Constitution gives only
Congress the power to appropriate funds, Clinton can veto Republican
balanced budgets till doomsday, but he can't force Republicans
to spend a dime more money than they want to. To paraphrase House
Appropriations Committee Chairman Livingston: ``When you veto
a zero, you still get zero.'' 
<P>
The real battle looming is not between Republicans and Democrats,
but rather between Republicans and Republicans. At stake is the
soul of the party in the post-Reagan era. Now we find out who
really runs the GOP: conservative visionaries Newt Gingrich and
Dick Armey? Or Bob Dole, Bob Packwood, John Chafee, and other
centerfield Senate Republicans whose concept of a bold new agenda
for America is a slightly less expensive version of the liberal
welfare state?
<P>
``There are a dozen, maybe two, Senate Republicans who are deathly
afraid of a budget train wreck,'' concedes one Senate leadership
staffer. ``They are desperate to avoid the politics of gridlock.''
These are the same GOP senators who have spent the past six months
voiding much of the Contract with America. They now want to chop
off the legs of House conservatives by plotting a separate peace
with Clinton on the budget. Sen. Pete Domenici is already sketching
the outlines of a deal with White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta
that would balance the budget over 8 or 9 years (rather than 7)
and neuter the tax cuts. 
<P>
Any such negotiated settlement with the White House would be a
monumental political and policy blunder. Almost nothing could
do more to resuscitate this comatose Presidency and re-establish
Bill Clinton's policy ``relevance'' than this. And any budget
that Clinton would willingly agree to is a budget not worth having.

<P>
It's not clear why so many Republicans are terrorized by the prospect
of a budget train wreck. A train wreck --  Washington's metaphor
for a fiscal stalemate between the White House and Congress that
causes a short-term shutdown of the government -- conjures up
the image of a kind of mutual assured destruction: everyone loses.
In reality the only casualties would be hundreds of liberal spending
programs. Under the Anti-Deficiency Act, all ``essential federal
activities'' -- the FBI, the military, the courts, the air-traffic-control
system, and other agencies that protect Americans from ``an imminent
threat to life or property'' -- must remain in full operation
if the budget is not approved. Social Security checks would still
be sent out. Everything else, though, from the Legal Services
Corporation, to the National Endowment for the Arts, to the Department
of Education, would grind to a halt. (Sounds as if I died and
went to heaven!)
<P>
Newt Gingrich was right on target when he explained that the GOP
isn't the least bit reluctant to allow Clinton to close down federal
operations, because ``it's their government, not ours.'' Clinton's
threatening conservative Republicans with the prospect of a government
shutdown that would largely defund the agencies of the Left is
as if Harry Truman had threatened that if Japan didn't surrender,
he would drop the bomb on New York City.
<P>
Republicans have been in Washington too long if they believe that
Americans would fret over a five- or six-day time out from having
to pay taxes for a multitude of nonessential government activities,
such as the Small Business Administration, transit subsidies,
or Title X sex-education grants. It's no great catastrophe if
the public schools have to economize by cutting condom-distribution
programs. Former Reagan Administration budget director Jim Miller,
who is urging Republicans not to blink first, recently conjured
up the ultimate liberal nightmare: ``If Clinton shuts down the
government, most Americans may not even notice.'' How many Americans
are even aware that there were seven temporary closures of the
government between 1981 and 1990?
<P>
If Clinton vetoes appropriations bills or the extension of the
$5-trillion debt ceiling, Republicans have a rare opportunity
to unilaterally impose a de facto balanced budget immediately.
Gingrich and Dole could essentially confront Clinton with an ultimatum:
until you accept our seven-year balanced budget plan, our tax
cuts, and our welfare overhaul, we will suspend any further borrowing
this year and prohibit you from spending money on all but the
essentials of government. In fact, Nick Smith, Christopher Shays,
and 150 other House Republicans have declared unequivocally in
a letter to the President and the congressional leadership that
they will refuse to raise the statutory ceiling on the debt until
``legislation is enacted ensuring a balanced budget by 2002 or
sooner.'' 
<P>
Engaging in a high-stakes budget collision with the White House
is unarguably a high-risk political strategy. Senate Republicans
worry that voters' attitude will be: A plague on both your houses.
But it's of no small consequence that the roles in this year's
budget conflict between Capitol Hill and the White House will
be reversed from the institutional struggles of the 1980s: this
Congress is trying to balance the budget, not bankrupt it. In
any face-off with the White House, Gingrich and his allies have
the enormous public-relations advantage that they are the ones
on the side of the angels. More importantly, the central virtue
of a knock-down, drag-out budget fight between congressional Republicans
and the White House is that it will help sharply define for 1996
voters the ideological grand canyon between the two parties. 
<P>
The danger to the GOP majorities in Congress is the growing public
perception that Republicans are doing too little, not too much.
I became aware of this at a political summit of Perot supporters
in Virginia earlier this summer where participants blasted this
``do-nothing Congress.'' One frustrated voter told me that, yes,
he realized there is an ideological war over the size and scope
of government in Washington. But he asked: ``Which side of the
war are Republicans on?'' 
<P>
It's a fair question. We'll have the answer in a few weeks.

I've loaded up Windows 95 and I'm multi-tasking like crazy! I've
got some campaign e-mail on one screen, Tipper's all-fiber diet
on another, and an article for the Washington Post -- it's about
people in New York City who steal other people's recyclables.
I'm e-mailing it to you right now. All I've got to do is double-click
on the MSN icon . . . here goes . . .
<P>
FOCUS GROUP #19 8/27/95 BEST WESTERN INN -- LAKE HAVASU, ARIZONA.
PARTICIPANTS: Bill, 47, white male; Otis, 64, white male; Marjorie,
34, black female; Dakotah, 23, white female; Keith, 42, black
male; Dakota, 25, white male.
<P>
MODERATOR: Well, first, let me thank you all for coming here --

<P>
DAKOTA: Where's my 25 bucks, hosehead?
<P>
MODERATOR: If I could just -- 
<P>
MARJORIE: Are my kids okay outside?
<P>
MODERATOR: I'm handing out some pages -- 
<P>
OTIS: No one -- that's NO ONE, Sunny Jim -- is taking away my
Medicare.
<P>
MARJORIE: I'm going to check on my kids.
<P>
MODERATOR: Well, we're not really talking about Medicare today.
If I could direct your attention -- 
<P>
OTIS: Damn right we're not talking about Medicare, because NO
ONE is going to take it away.
<P>
DAKOTA: Twenty-five bucks, doofoid.
<P>
DAKOTAH: Can you let the man talk, please?
<P>
MODERATOR: Thanks. What I'd like to talk about is your feelings
about Bill Clinton and Al Gore.
<P>
OTIS: Hate 'em. Hate 'em both. And that wife of his tried to steal
my Medicare.
<P>
MODERATOR: Um . . . okay, we'll start with Otis. Otis, you say
that you quote hate unquote Bill Clinton and Al Gore -- 
<P>
OTIS: And his wife.
<P>
MODERATOR: Whose wife?
<P>
OTIS: Clinton's wife. The Medicare thief.
<P>
MODERATOR: And so you'd describe yourself as someone who is .
. . what? Conservative? Liberal?
<P>
OTIS: I'd describe myself as someone who's entitled to Medicare.
<P>
MODERATOR: Okay, moving right along. Bill, you've been awfully
quiet.
<P>
BILL: That's due to my incredible, simmering rage.
<P>
MODERATOR: I see. And to whom do you direct your rage?
<P>
BILL: My wife.
<P>
MODERATOR: I mean in a political sense.
<P>
BILL: Still her.
<P>
MODERATOR: Let me be more specific. Are you angry because as a
white middle-aged man you feel that your place in society is eroding,
and that the general lawlessness of the streets has come to make
you feel like an outsider in your own country?
<P>
BILL: Well, I wasn't before you mentioned it, but, wow, I see
your point. I am so freaking angry!
<P>
DAKOTAH: Then join a militia, Nazi man!
<P>
BILL: What?
<P>
DAKOTAH: I know all about you angry white men! My dad is one!
At first he was real nice and real supportive and then when I
changed my name to Dakotah and got my nose pierced he was like,
a crazy man. So full of rage. I reject that rage.
<P>
MODERATOR: Dakotah, how would you describe your politics?
<P>
DAKOTAH: I wouldn't.
<P>
MODERATOR: You mean you can't describe your feelings?
<P>
DAKOTAH: No, I mean that you probably work for the government
which killed Kennedy and Malcolm X and if I told you what I really
believe you'd have me killed just like you killed Jerry Garcia.
<P>
MODERATOR: Keith . . . how about you?
<P>
KEITH: Oh, am I here?
<P>
MODERATOR: Excuse me?
<P>
KEITH: The black man always goes last.
<P>
MODERATOR: I was going clockwise.
<P>
KEITH: To you, clockwise. To me, a systematic method of silencing
my voice.
<P>
MODERATOR: I'm terribly sorry.
<P>
KEITH: You think that white man is angry? Check under my hood
sometime.
<P>
BILL: Are you saying that you're angrier than me?
<P>
KEITH: Damn right I am.
<P>
BILL: I'm WAY angrier than you.
<P>
KEITH: Oh yeah?
<P>
BILL: Yeah.
<P>
KEITH: Rodney King!
<P>
BILL: O.J. walks!
<P>
KEITH: Mark Fuhrman!
<P>
BILL: Gangsta rap!
<P>
MODERATOR: Gentlemen! Please! All I want to know is how you would
describe yourselves politically.
<P>
KEITH: Angry. I'd describe myself as angry.
<P>
BILL: Me too.
<P>
OTIS: You know what I think.
<P>
MODERATOR: Yes, I think I can recall. Thank you all for coming.

Where Does Fuhrman Take Us?
<P>
NEW YORK, AUGUST 25
<P>
One account analyzes the Mark Fuhrman situation as follows: If
the exposure of the tapes comes in as the closing episode in the
trial, the probability is high that the disgust and loathing for
Detective Fuhrman (richly deserved) will provoke in the jury a
sentiment extraneous to the question, Did O. J. kill his former
wife and her companion? Instead, the analysis goes on, the jurors
will ask themselves, How can we express our disgust? Well -- the
analyst concludes -- by voting, Not Guilty.
<P>
The prosecution will of course make an earnest, desperate attempt
to situate the tapes in context. Marcia Clark will argue that
Houdini himself could not have contrived to arrange the evidence
against O. J. with which the prosecution has made its case. The
chief of police in Los Angeles, Mr. Willie Williams, told a press
conference that ``it is inconceivable to believe that for this
one murder 10, 20, 30, or 40 people got together to plot against
Mr. Simpson.'' Only Oliver Stone could stitch together a plot
to do in O. J. that originated at two in the morning and matured
with a bloody glove at his residence, and bloodstains that identified
O. J., his ex-wife, and Mr. Goldman here and there along the route
from the scene of the crime back to Simpson's residence.
<P>
But the thinking at the moment is that the jury will waive matters
that have dulled in memories of men and women who must be feeling
as though they had been sentenced to perpetual isolation during
a seemingly endless trial. Human sensibilities are as they are,
and the jurors are not likely to blame the defense for their incarceration.
The enemy will be the Establishment: the judge who ordained their
isolation, the prosecution that droned on endlessly, and, above
all, the Los Angeles Police Department, which retained in its
ranks someone who -- if the tapes are to be believed -- lives
in fury against the existence of blacks, women, homosexuals, and
civil rights. 
<P>
It is mystifying what exactly were the objectives of Mr. Fuhrman
in his recorded conversations with Laura Hart McKinny, the scholar
at the North Carolina School of Arts, starting in 1985. He reported
to her (according to one passage in the tapes) how on one occasion
he and fellow officers handled four suspects. ``We basically tortured
them. We broke 'em. Their faces were just mush. They had pictures
of the walls with blood all the way to the ceiling and finger
marks of [them] trying to crawl out of the room.'' A messy business,
handling suspects in that way. It required Mr. Fuhrman and his
fellow law enforcers to clean themselves up with a garden hose.

<P>
Now the Fuhrman narrative gives one pause. It does not surprise
that here and there one comes upon sadists, whether in Los Angeles
or in Gulag. The viewers of the Rodney King beating tend to reason,
Why should we be surprised? Such evidently is the way the police
in Los Angeles, and perhaps elsewhere, routinely act. But the
Rodney King story is complicated. Extensive investigations revealed
that there was a genuine, spastic concern that King might be armed,
might have intended his own impetuous defense using a weapon.
But in the Fuhrman telling of the treatment of four suspects there
would seem to be nothing of that. It was clinical sadism. 
<P>
Already a quiet investigation by the Los Angeles Police has begun,
designed, no doubt, to track the record of men handled over the
years by Detective Fuhrman. Why did they not complain of their
treatment by him? And if there was a record of Fuhrman engaged
in such activity, why was he retained in the force? How will he
be handled by the law? As a perjurer? He swore under oath that
he had not used the term ``nigger'' when manifestly he had done
so, using the word not in the detached tones of a storyteller,
but with invidious gusto. ``You're talking sh--. You sound like
a nigger.''
<P>
It is endlessly fascinating. Fuhrman the cool bigot. O. J., who
earned the confidence of his private investigator because of the
coolness of his behavior in Chicago in the hours immediately after
the killing. How could somebody so casual in his conduct during
those hours before being told of his ex-wife's murder be guilty?
But of course such reasoning, from the particular to the general,
would justify confidence that the Fuhrman observed on the witness
stand could not be the same Fuhrman who spoke into those tapes.

<P>
The jury's responsibility in this case is awesome, extending far
beyond the question of O. J.'s guilt or innocence. It touches
on the recognition of the awful baseness of which human beings
-- Americans -- are capable.

<P>

<P>
<LI>Big winners from <B>Ross Perot</B> confab are an ideological grab-bag:
<B>Pat Buchanan, Jesse Jackson, John Kasich</B>. Former Perot pollster
<B>Frank Luntz</B>, however, points out that audience at United We Stand
America convention was not representative of Perot's '92 supporters.
(Would most Americans pay to hear more than three dozen politicians
speak?) . . . GOP presidential candidates addressed group despite
<B>Bill Bennett's</B> warnings not to kowtow to Perot. Not kowtowing
was front-runner <B>Bob Dole</B>, whose speech defended politicians and
criticized isolationism. According to <I>Washington Times</I>, Buchanan
``electrified'' crowd with America First and protectionist messages;
but <B>Alan Keyes</B> slammed Buchanan for downplaying anti-abortion
stand, less popular among UWSA members. <B>Phil Gramm</B> reiterated
pledges to balance budget in first term and to abolish federal
quotas by executive order in first day on job. (Dole recently
told columnist <I>Lally Weymouth</I> he would not issue such executive
orders.) <I>Lamar Alexander</I> predicted that independent candidacy
would re-elect <I>Bill Clinton</I> if party nominates Beltway insider
. . . Also sounding anti-Beltway note was <I>Pete Wilson</I>. Though
moderate/liberal on social issues, Wilson called rising illegitimacy
``the greatest threat I can think of to America's future.'' .
. . Survey for U.S. News finds that whites like <I>Colin Powell</I> more
than blacks do, ``largely because a surprising number of blacks
don't know much about him.'' Of blacks who can identify Powell,
19 per cent don't know his race.
<P>
<LI>Announcement by N.J. Sen.<B> Bill Bradley</B> that he won't run for re-election
next year reduces Democrats' already-slim chances of retaking
Senate. Dems currently hold 6 of 7 Senate seats that will be open
in 1996 -- and they lost all 6 of their open seats in '94. <B>Claiborne
Pell </B>(D., R.I.) is probably next out the door. Will <B>Sam Nunn</B>,
in Republican-friendly Georgia, be far behind? Dems may be lucky
to hold onto the power to filibuster. . . . Race to replace Bradley
is already crowded: among Republicans, Rep. <B>Dick Zimmer</B> is widely
expected to win nomination but <B>Richard DuHaime</B> is challenging
him from the Right; ex-Gov. <B>Tom Kean</B> and Rep. <B>Marge Roukema</B> could
jump in. Main contenders on Democrat side are likely to be Reps.
<B>Robert Torricelli</B> and <B>Robert Andrews</B>, but ex-Gov. <B>Jim Florio</B> is
interested. . . . <B>Newt Gingrich</B> and <B>John Lewis</B> (D., Ga.) -- the
same Lewis who recently disrupted a Gingrich symposium on Medicare
-- joined forces to submit a redistricting proposal to protect
Georgia's 11 congressional incumbents.
<P>
<LI><B>Norma McCorvey</B>, better known as Jane Roe of Roe v. Wade, departed
the pro-choice movement. Feminists,  she complains, never treated
her -- a reform-school dropout, former drug dealer and alcoholic
-- with respect. Reaction from <B>Sarah Weddington</B>, her lawyer in
Roe: ``It doesn't really matter. The case was a class-action suit.''
New York Times piles on: McCorvey ``never was much of a poster
girl for choice,'' declares editorial page. . . . Pro-lifers make
progress in state legislatures across the country. <B>Clarke Forsythe</B>
of Americans United for Life reports in Wall Street Journal that
so far this year four states have passed laws requiring parental
consent or at least notification before a minor daughter's abortion,
leaving only 12 states without such laws. Three states passed
informed-consent laws -- and Missouri would have joined them but
for Dem. Gov. <B>Mel Carnahan's</B> veto. And the Ohio legislature sent
a ban on ``partial-birth'' abortions to GOP Gov. <B>George Voinovich</B>
for his signature.
<P>
<LI>Defection of Lt.-Gen. <B>Hussein Kamel Hassan</B>, head of Iraq's military
industrialization -- including nuclear and poison-gas projects
-- means regime of <B>Saddam Hussein</B> is collapsing. Iraq itself might
splinter, with neighboring states wrangling for pieces in Yugoslav-type
ethnic free-for-all. . . . Colombia Prosecutor-General <B>Alfonso
Valdivieso</B> expects other drug traffickers to replace captured
Cali cartel leaders <B>Miguel Rodriguez Orejuelo</B> and his brother.
Defense Minister <B>Fernando Botero</B> resigned after accusations he
took drug money while running Pres. <B>Ernesto Samper's</B> campaign.
. . . Meanwhile, U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency chief <B>Thomas Constantine</B>
says amphetamines from Mexico are rapidly overtaking Colombian
cocaine as drug of choice in U.S. . . . Mexican police have grabbed
<B>Aaron Morel Lebaron</B>, leader of Texas polygamist sect who is accused
of ordering the murder of three members. . . . Senators <B>John McCain</B>
and <B>Joseph Lieberman</B> are co-sponsoring proposal to establish international
fund to arm Bosnian government. <B>Jesse Helms</B>, chairman of Foreign
Relations Committee, says, ``It's time we treated the Bosnian
people the same way we treated the Contras in Nicaragua and those
people in Afghanistan -- as freedom fighters.'' . . . Russian
ultranationalist <B>Vladimir Zhirinovsky</B> has ordered all his party's
candidates in December parliamentary elections to be examined
for drug addiction, mental illness, and criminal backgrounds.
. . . <B>Vitaly Usov</B>, general manager of new Moscow restaurant offering
traditional Russian fast-food, has taught waitresses to smile
like McDonald's employees.
<P>
<LI><B>Bob Dole</B> voted in Iowa's straw poll, but the <B>Gramms</B> did not. Quips

<HR>
11-September-1995

<P>

<LI>Republicans are pondering a budget showdown that would be, in
the words of one of their analysts, ``the fiscal equivalent of
dropping an atomic bomb on the government.'' Aw, go ahead. It's
the right thing to do. Don't even wait for a budget crisis. Do
it!
<P>
<LI>If you shut down the government, every family in the country would
get a pay raise of, oh, $300 a week. Of course we'd have to give
up bureaucrats and Form 1040, but most families could easily afford
that. Do it!
<P>
<LI>If you have doubts, think of the number of American casualties
it would cost to invade. Do it!
<P>
<LI>You might think that Newt Gingrich is calling for tax cuts because
of a commitment to limited government and economic growth. If
so, you obviously have not read Gail Sheehy's profile of Gingrich
in the September <I>Vanity Fair</I>. Miss Sheehy's readers know that
tax cuts, Medicare reform, and deregulation are not policies at
all, but mental anomalies to be explained by Gingrich's longing
to be loved by two cold, authoritarian fathers. The Speaker is,
in short, a victim. But he is not to be indulged like most victims,
because he is dangerous. Miss Sheehy's article is unlikely, however,
to be remembered for its contribution to public understanding
of manic depression. Much more titillating are her allegations
of infidelities during Gingrich's first marriage, which ended
in 1981. Whatever the truth of the matter, it is none of Miss
Sheehy's -- or the reading public's -- business. Most people are
not saints, and their reputations would suffer from harsh scrutiny.
It might be a different matter if Mr. Gingrich had presented himself
as a sterling moral leader. But he has not done so. The only silver
lining to the story is that it may help dissuade Mr. Gingrich
from entering the presidential race this time  -- which, as we
have argued, would be against his own interests anyway.
<P>
<LI>If President Clinton really wants to stop teenagers from smoking,
he should propose a law requiring that they must be able to read
the writing on a cigarette package before it can be sold to them.
<P>
<LI>Defense hawks are questioning Senate Republicans' commitment to
strategic defense. The House's defense authorization bill, and
previously the Senate's, required that a multiple-site ballistic-missile
defense system be <I>deployed</I> by 2003. But now Senators Cohen, Warner,
Nunn, and Levin have reached a bipartisan agreement (if Cohen
and Warner count as Republicans) which speaks instead of ``developing
for deployment'' -- in other words, still more years on the drawing
board. Armed Services Committee Chairman Strom Thurmond has signed
off on the deal, which will be approved by the Senate. If missile-defense
supporters in the House hold firm in conference, however, they
can probably win enough votes in the Senate for final passage
of their version of the bill. It's high time for Republicans to
come to the defense of missile defense.
<P>
<LI>Hurricane Felix drifted in, drifted out, drifted around, killed
a few people, and otherwise acted remarkably like United States
foreign policy.
<P>
<LI>If Bill Bradley had retired in September, or July, or anytime
except a very slow August, the nation might have been spared the
hype surrounding the New Jersey senator's hint at an independent
presidential bid. Two days on the front page of the <I>Washington
Post</I>. Four pages, including an interview, in <I>Newsweek</I>. Bradley
says both parties are failing America. But in what ways does this
self-styled maverick -- a roughly 90 per cent Americans for Democratic
Action liberal who voted against unfunded-mandate reform, regulatory
reform, and the Balanced Budget Amendment -- differ from his President?
``The issue isn't where I agree or disagree with the President,''
he told <I>Newsweek</I>. ``It's too easy to say, Well, I agree on these
five, I disagree on those four. What does that tell anybody?''
More than anything else we're likely to hear from Bill Bradley.
The senator's glowing coverage suggests that this pillar of the
establishment can, through the sheer force of his seriousness
and decency, save American democracy. From what exactly? He's
not saying.<P>
<LI>And if Bill Bradley is thinking of running for President
as an independent, he joins others considering such a run, including
Jesse Jackson, Colin Powell, Lowell Weicker, and Ross Perot. The
only independent to announce so far is Bill Clinton.
<P>
<LI>On August 17, Whitewater Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr indicted
Clinton crony and business partner James McDougal on 19 counts
of fraud and related crimes. Starr also indicted McDougal's former
wife, Susan, and Arkansas Governor Jim Guy Tucker. This can't
be good news for the Clintons. The McDougals and Clintons were
50 - 50 partners in the Whitewater Development Corporation. Whitewater
contributed to the failure of Madison Guaranty Savings &amp; Loan
-- which cost taxpayers $60 million. Resolution Trust Corporation
investigator Jean Lewis told the House Banking Committee that
Whitewater -- hence, the Clintons -- benefited from Mr. McDougal's
fraudulent activities. Miss Lewis also testified that she was
``obstructed, hampered, and manipulated'' during the course of
her investigation and placed on administrative leave along with
the two supervisors who had backed her. There are several problems
here. First, the Clintons' taxes. They deducted two interest payments
(one of $2,811, the other of $2,322) on loans that were paid not
by them, but by Whitewater. Also, from 1982 to 1986, McDougal
was making their Whitewater mortgage payments. The Clintons claim
they did not know of McDougal's generosity, and they never bothered
to ask who was making the payments. In other words, don't ask,
don't tell.
<P>
<LI>Led by Reps. Barney Frank, Charles Schumer, and Maxine Waters,
the Democrats at the House Whitewater hearings exercised the full
extent of their mental faculties and moral superiority by emitting
grunts, bleats, cackles, groans, chirps, and snorts whenever they
didn't want to hear the evidence, which was usually. Chairman
Jim Leach finally had to rule ``guttural noises'' out of order.
Why didn't anyone think of that these last sixty years?
<P>
<LI>As the number of Whitewater-related indictments rose to 14, Bill
Clinton has denied ever being governor of Arkansas.
<P>
<LI>It didn't take Shannon Faulkner long to realize that there had
to be an easier way to lose twenty pounds. On August 9, the U.S.
4th District Court of Appeals had ordered The Citadel to admit
Miss Faulkner, despite her being above the weight limit, and despite
her refusal to submit to a physical evaluation. By mid afternoon
of the first day of the plebes' Hell Week, Miss Faulkner was in
the infirmary, from which she did not emerge until her hastily
called press conference at week's end. ``I don't think there's
any dishonor in leaving,'' she stated. ``I think there's dis-justice
in my staying and killing myself just for the political point.''
Her unscripted admission on why she had waged her prolonged assault
on the all-male military college was unsurprising. Miss Faulkner's
simple plea for equal treatment was belied by the fact that she
wanted to attend the demanding, 152-year-old institution on her
own terms and clearly relished her role as feminist icon -- until
reveille sounded, and Gloria Allred was nowhere to be found.
<P>
<LI>A dozen top Iraqis defected from Baghdad to Jordan, and ``Jane
Roe'' defected from her pro-abortion stance to join Operation
Rescue. David Gergen is demanding royalties.
<P>
<LI>In an interview in the <I>Wall Street Journal</I> Bui Tin, the North
Vietnamese general who received South Vietnam's unconditional
surrender in 1975, confirmed what the Right has known all along:
the antiwar protestors undermined the American war effort and,
yes, through visits of prominent Americans to Hanoi, gave aid
and comfort to the enemy. Says General Bui: ``[The antiwar protestors]
represented the conscience of America. [That conscience] was part
of its war-making capability, and we were turning that power in
our favor.'' Thomas Sowell argues in <I>Forbes</I> that Thirties pacifists
in England, France, and the U.S. helped cause an unnecessary World
War II by keeping their governments from building up deterrent
arms, thus giving Germany and her allies a crucial head start.
In the case of Vietnam the protestors didn't cause the war, but
they weakened our will to continue, resulting in our broken promise
to the people of South Vietnam and -- lest we forget -- to the
57,000 Americans who died there. The Sixties pacifists can atone
for their past offenses by admitting what their professions of
peace-and-love led to.
<P>
<LI>Alternative energy is having some problems, according to the newsletter
<I>Access to Energy</I>. Twenty per cent of the mirrors at the solar-power
field in Barstow, California, are broken, and the rest are working
at reduced efficiency because smoke from the Mount Pinatubo eruption
four years ago is still reducing the intensity of sunlight. Southern
California Edison isn't too unhappy about the low productivity
because it is required by federal law to pay the solar electric
generators 15a/kWh compared to its own generation costs of 3a/kWh.
(Then again, in the absence of competition it can pass the higher
power bills on to its customers.) Meanwhile, at another politically
correct project which generates electricity by means of windmills,
the blades have chopped up thousands of birds in the past two
years, including 78 golden eagles. And at El Centro, California,
a power plant that burns biomass is out of commission: the manure
it was being fed as fuel wouldn't burn after recent wet weather,
and the plant is plugged up with the stuff. No report on whether
it is being tested for conformity to air-quality standards.
<P>
<LI>A controversy broke out in the advertising world over some vaguely
soft pornographic ads taken out by Calvin Klein in <I>YM</I>, a magazine
for girls ages 12 and up. The ads show under-age models in various
states of undress. As reported in the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>, the
dispute focuses on whether the ads will or will not offend the
young girls who read <I>YM</I>. ``Something that is offensive to adults
may not be to kids,'' reasoned Ira Garey, publisher of <I>Sassy</I>.
``It [the ad campaign] just isn't subtle enough and therefore
isn't cool,'' countered Jane Grossman, publisher of<I> Seventeen</I>.
Nobody seems to have thought about the moral effect the ads might
have. That just wouldn't be subtle enough and therefore wouldn't
be cool.
<P>
<LI>President Clinton is warning Iraq that any military moves against
Kuwait or Saudi Arabia will be met with the full mobilization
of Mark Fuhrman.

Fear Itself
<P>
RICH LOWRY
<P>
Mr. Lowry is NR's national political reporter
<P>
WASHINGTON, D.C.
<P>
``DIRTY rotten stinking . . . meat,'' screams the headline of
the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) press release.
``Warner to Voters: `Eat This.' '' DSCC executive director Don
Foley elaborates: ``Senator Warner is an E-Coli Republican. His
vote for corporate greed and irresponsible government literally
threatens American lives.'' Lest anyone miss the point, the DSCC
release includes a cartoon depicting Warner dishing out putrid
meat to a kid.
<P>
 Juvenile campaign tactics are, of course, a bi-partisan affair.
The National Republican Congressional Committee's recent ``wanted''
poster of prominent House liberals won't be winning awards for
high-mindedness. But there are differences that make Democratic
broadsides worth special notice: their shrill attacks still have
a credulous echo-chamber among the establishment media; they often
seem to work; and they may be all that's left in the Democratic
arsenal.
<P>
Consider the stalled effort on regulatory reform. On July 3, as
the Senate prepared to take up Bob Dole's reform bill, the<I> New
York Times</I> ran a front-page story that alleged a GOP assault on
food safety. Calls poured in to the Center for Science in the
Public Interest, a consumer-advocacy group that along with Safe
Tables Our Priority (STOP), a coalition of families of <I>E. coli</I>
victims, had already been agitating on food safety. These groups
argued that regulatory reform would nix proposed U.S. Department
of Agriculture (USDA) meat-inspection standards, exposing millions
to tainted meat.
<P>
At one event, activists took 100 hamburgers to Capitol Hill to
hand out to senators, daring them to play ``hamburger roulette.''
Reporters ate it up. In the wake of the Jack in the Box outbreak
in 1993 in which three children died, the bacterium is a high-profile
poster-child for food contamination. Perhaps the most damaging
story was one that aired on ABC News, with a reporter alleging
that under regulatory reform new meat-inspection rules ``could
be dismantled.'' Then the father of an <I>E. coli</I> victim warned against
any reform-induced delay of new rules: ``Every time there's a
delay, over one child a day dies.&quot;
<P>
The thrust of the ABC story and most other <I>E. coli</I> commentary
in the media was dubious on three grounds: 
<P>
-- The original draft of the Dole bill had several provisions
providing an emergency by-pass for new regulations deemed necessary
to protect the public from an imminent threat to its health or
safety. In any case, the bill's cost - benefit analysis wouldn't
stop new meat-inspection rules if they were likely to deliver
the touted benefits.
<P>
 -- The proposed new testing is expressly aimed at catching meat
infected with salmonella, not <I>E. coli</I>. Activists and the media
focused on <I>E. coli</I> anyway because it's scarier. Furthermore, the
difference between the inspection changes favored by industry
and those sought by the USDA is hardly dramatic.
<P>
 -- The figure of 500 <I>E. coli</I> deaths a year -- more than one child
dying a day -- is surely an exaggeration. Anti-reform activists
cite the Centers for Disease Control for the figures. But when
the independent D.C.-based Statistical Assessment Service (STATS)
ran the numbers, knocking out unwarranted extrapolations, it came
up with a range of 3 to 73 <I>E. coli</I> deaths a year.
<P>
``What you really seem to be getting is a known prospect for maybe
3 or 4 people a year dying and then a huge black box of assumptions
and guesses,'' says David Murray of STATS. ``The highest-end numbers
were selected to get the maximum exposure from [the] press.
<P>
''ON THE environment the story is similar. When Republicans proposed
restrictions on the Environmental Protection Agency in July, Democrats
accused them of -- what else? -- endangering children. The Republican
changes, Rep. Barbara Kennelly (D., Conn.) charged, ``will make
it easier for lead and arsenic to contaminate our drinking water,
causing immeasurable harm to our children.'' Louis Stokes (D.,
Ohio) told listeners that ``while efforts to control refinery
toxic emissions go into suspended animation, the lungs of our
citizens will not.
<P>
''Never mind that with the exception of a provision limiting enforcement
of the Clean Water Act -- meant to prod the Senate into re-authorizing
the Clean Water Act -- many of the 17 so-called ``riders'' on
the EPA appropriations bill are minor, dealing with issues like
auto-emissions testing. President Clinton still denounced the
bill as a threat to Americans' ``basic safety.'' In August, he
alleged it would allow oil refineries ``to spew benzene, a cancer-causing
chemical, without stringent safeguards.'' Actually, the rider
in question is meant to keep the EPA from using 15-year-old emissions
data to justify a new tightening of refinery regulations.
<P>
Still, Democratic jabs can sting. ``If you give them any kind
of hook,'' explains a GOP leadership aide, ``even if it's not
wholly true or wholly accurate, they can use that to reinforce
[a] pre-existing notion.'' Especially on issues like regulation
and the environment, Republicans resort to a defensive crouch.
``On welfare, the Speaker and Republican leaders are able to articulate
an alternative vision,'' says Jonathan Adler of the Competitive
Enterprise Institute. ``The Republicans have yet to transfer that
approach to the environment.
<P>
''The bright side to the Democratic assaults is that the party
seems to have little else. As Majority Leader Dick Armey likes
to put it: ``The party that once lived by the proud motto 'We
have nothing to fear, but fear itself,' has been reduced to a
political strategy of: 'We have nothing to offer but fear itself.'''
<P>
But fear together with a compliant media can be a useful weapon.
In March, a GOP staffer held a courtesy briefing for Democratic
staff on regulatory reform. He had three lawyers, all experts,
along to help answer questions. Afterwards, an account of the
meeting was leaked to the <I>New York Times</I> (almost certainly by
a Democratic staffer), which on March 31 ran a front-page story
suggesting that the lawyers' presence at the informal, open briefing
proved that lobbyists control the GOP. The White House talked
up the story. The Ralph Nader group Public Citizen filed ethics
charges (which have since been dismissed). The evidence? The March
31 <I>New York Times</I>.

<HR>
11-September-1995

<P>

<P>
Dear Rusty,
<P>
This is going to sound strange, but I'd appreciate it if you'd
please sign the enclosed ``I'm Mad as Hell! Perot in '96!'' petition,
get your research associates down there in Brazil to sign it --
heck, we're not too picky about their citizenship status -- and
pouch it back to me ASAP, so I can dash it down to Dad in Tennessee
and he can mail it from the local post office. I'd ask you to
send it yourself, but if Perot sees a postmark from south of the
border, well, he goes bananasville.
<P>
It's all part of our ``43% and Holding!'' strategy for '96. And
let me be totally honest: for the first time, I get the sense
that Bill is firing on all jets. We had our usual guy-to-guy lunch
yesterday -- just him and me, one on one, except for Dick Morris,
Leon Panetta, Dick Schoen, and Mark McCurry -- and did he ever
have fire in his belly!
<P>
Part of that could be the new McBacon Salsa Ranch Burgers and
the SuperSize Fries (``SuperSize it!'' Bill always says . . .
) that we -- well, that he -- had for lunch, and part of it could
be the fact that he'd just approved Mrs. William J. Clinton's
trip to Beijing (``Stay a while,'' he said breezily. ``SuperSize
it!''), and another part of it could be that the family settled
on Jackson Hole for its summer vacation (``Get me some new shorts!''
he barked good-naturedly at George Stephanopoulos, ``and SuperSize
'em!''), but I think most of it had to do with his sudden realization
that we have 1996 in the bag. 
<P>
In the first place, Bob Dole is pretty much a lock for the Republican
ticket. So we're ahead going in. And in the second place, it looks
certain that Ross Perot will join the fray. I have to be totally
honest with you, Rusty -- two weeks ago, I'd have bet that the
little guy was going to sit this one out.
<P>
So we thought and thought: if only there was some way to goad
him into running, some way to make it clear how little we fear
him and how low our regard is for his importance. 
<P>
``Send Mack McClarty to talk to him,'' Dick Morris suggested,
which I said I thought was odd since McClarty had retired to Arkansas
months ago, but then I was informed that he was still here, not
just in the District, but here here, in the White House here,
and so I scraped the egg off my face (!) and signed on. We send
Mack down to Dallas -- he opened for Alan Keyes, I think -- and
if I'm not mistaken, it was a ``message received'' situation.

<P>
Then, the new Vanity Fair came out with Gail Sheehy's article
on Newt Gingrich. She serves up some pretty spicy revelations,
and boy, did Bill ever eat it up. He flipped through that issue
like wildfire, pages snapping every second. ``I've done that,''
he said at one page, ``did that,'' at another, ``did that twice,''
at another, and ``did that, almost did that, watched that'' at
the final few pages, and tossed the issue aside with a resounding,
``That boy better learn to SuperSize it!'' A few minutes later,
he was on the phone to the woman Sheehy quotes, thanking her for
her ``forthright honesty'' and asking her if she lives in ``the
202 area code.'' It's nice to see him connecting with voters again.
<P>
And, of course, it's nice to see him connecting with Gingrich,
too. As rough as the past few months have been, I think Dick Morris
is right when he says that ``Gingrich in the Big House keeps Bill
in the White House,'' so when Bill read the Vanity Fair article,
the first thing he said was: ``We can do business with him.''
I think Bill really noticed the parallels in their lives -- you
know: strong, slightly nutty moms; weird dad situations; both
kind of fat. The only problem I see is that Bill is insisting
on meeting the woman Sheehy interviews -- ``opposition research,''
he insists -- and that sounds a little too Jimmy-Carter-scheduling-the-White-House-tennis-court
to me. ``Let the experts do it,'' I counseled. 
<P>
I'll admit that there were some tense moments around here when
Bill Bradley announced that he was retiring from the Senate. He
really tore into the current partisanship that's dividing both
houses in Congress. I have to admit that I agree. Congress was
much, much better a few years ago before all those Republicans
got elected. But the bottom line is that he won't run against
me and Bill. He's a centrist, moderate New Democrat -- and there's
only room for one of us on the ticket. Plus, he and Colin Powell
are going to be mighty busy with their respective book tours.
<P>
So the view from here is that we're looking pretty good. About
the only fly in the ointment is the Congressional Medal of Freedom
campaign that Tipper wants to launch for Jerry Garcia. I'm sorry,
Rusty, call me a square, but I don't think the guy who wrote ``Truckin'''
needs any more honors. 
<P>
Gotta go! The NSC wire just blipped out a cable. Saddam Hussein
is massing troops on the Kuwaiti border. Somebody up there likes
us!

<P>
Newt Draws Fire
<P>
NEW YORK,
<P>
It's interesting how many are left feeling insecure when the subject
of Newt Gingrich comes up. Dan Quayle, Spiro Agnew, Jesse Helms
-- they can be handled with that equanimity that mainlines its
way onto critics who are confident they are peering down on their
targets. Newt Gingrich doesn't work for them in quite that way.
For one thing he has a very advanced academic degree; for another,
he is politically defter than most of his critics, and nothing
generates hurt like yet one more primary victory by Tricky Dick.
Gingrich stitched together a year ago the unthinkable, a proposed
legislative agenda for a Republican Congress. The whole world
laughed at such presumption and the next thing we knew, the House
of Representatives became Republican. They stopped making certain
kinds of jokes about FDR after 100 days, but in the case of Newt,
the need to laugh begins to sound like the aristocracy in the
Winter Palace, continuing to twit while the Revolution gathered
outdoors. 
<P>
Consider Maureen Dowd of the New York Times. Her recent assault
on Gingrich was ostensibly triggered by his confession that he
was not schooled in foreign policy (he had blurted out that Taiwan
should be recognized diplomatically). But Miss Dowd doesn't conceal
the totality of her concern over the Speaker. She entitled her
piece ``The Loss of the Dodo''; led off by remarking that Newt
was ``sickeningly'' cute; and ended by confessing her ``distress''
at the prospect of ``the Speaker frolicking in the woods with
a bunch of guys in sheets and dresses.''
<P>
The ``cute'' business was a reaction to Mr. Gingrich's having
told a visiting witness that she was welcome to ``come see my
dinosaur.'' The reference is to a facsimile skull kept in Mr.
Gingrich's office, which wouldn't strike most people as ``cute,''
so long as the addict stops short of dinosaur figures on his stationery
or calls for a National Dinosaur Day.
<P>
As to the foreign-policy statement (Why don't we just recognize
Taiwan?), in the same issue that carried Miss Dowd's column, the
Times ran a major story about Taiwan and the loss of national
identity by its people. Taiwan is large enough and important enough
to warrant recognition, but we have here the problem of, ``If
you had some ham we could have a ham sandwich, if I had some bread''
-- neither Taiwan nor China will affirm the obvious, which is
that modern Taiwan is as much a zone of modern China as Algeria
is a zone of France.
<P>
Then there is the frolicking in the woods. 
<P>
Miss Dowd noted that Mr. Gingrich would spend the weekend at the
Bohemian Grove, ``the exclusive men's club in northern California.
. . . The camp is a saturnalia of juvenilia, with a lot of old
white rich guys running around naked and in sheets, costumed as
Druids. They drink dawn-to-dusk gin fizzes, relieve themselves
on redwoods, and put on theatricals where they dress up like women.''

<P>
Well yes, but if you are playing the part of a woman in a theatrical,
what should you dress like? Miss Dowd might as well have written
that she doesn't understand why the people in the Metropolitan
Opera chorus go around clutching spears. 
<P>
About five years ago, CBS's Leslie Stahl did an interview with
me about women joining the Century Association. A few minutes
into the discussion she interrupted herself. ``Would you be willing
to talk about the Bohemian Club?''
<P>
Well, I said, it isn't something we're supposed to talk about.
. . .
<P>
``Well,'' Miss Stahl pressed, ``what about this business of going
around naked?''
<P>
I lowered my voice. ``In the years I've been going to the Bohemian
Club,'' I whispered, ``I have seen men naked only in the shower,
and now I'll tell you something in confidence.'' Her eyes hungered
for my revelation. The camera whirred. ``The Admissions Committee
of the Bohemian Grove does not like to admit to membership people
who shower with their clothes on.'' Miss Stahl simply smiled,
gamely. 
<P>
Did Maureen Dowd believe that men in the Grove go about naked?
No, she did not. Two days before her story appeared she telephoned
an old friend, an ex-member of the Club, who told her the naked
business was sheer fantasy -- ``It just doesn't happen.'' Perhaps
Miss Dowd thought to be cute by perpetuating the legend, and in
a way she succeeded, and I'd even go so far as to deny that she
was at this point sickeningly cute. 
<P>
Saturnalia? Those in the Bohemian Grove who drink gin fizzes all
day long (I know of two) drink gin fizzes from dawn to dusk wherever
they are. A drunkard need not bother to travel to California in
order to indulge his habit. But then Miss Dowd would rather spice
up her column than report facts, proving only that the antagonism
to Newt conquers all, even if it does not excuse all.

War Crimes and Misdemeanors
<P>
<LI>William Letwin's article, contrasting a recent visit to Japan with his earlier arrival as a young U.S. occupier in 1945, offers in general a benign judgment of what has been achieved by the Japanese since then. But about Japanese war guilt he feels disquiet.
<P>
With good reasons: the half-heartedness of the official Japanese apology for wartime crimes; the fact that even so modest a gesture was supported by less than half the Diet; and the Japanese concentration upon Hiroshima as the central event of World War II.
<P>
Mr. Letwin points to the main flaw of MacArthur's Occupation, otherwise rightly celebrated, namely that it did not force the Japanese to face up to the fact that Japan entered the war as an aggressor and committed war crimes on a scale that shocked even hardened soldiers. 
<P>
But national amnesia of that kind is common, national repentance on the postwar German model a rarity.
<P>
What is odd is that the U.S. should today agree to gloss over its victory. According to the script of President Clinton's Hawaii commemoration of V-J Day, however, it now turns out that we defeated the Pacific. As Dorothy Rabinowitz drily observed in the<I> Wall Street Journal</I>, the next stage will be to call it: Event in the Pacific.
<P>
This is doubtless intended to suggest America has generously decided to forget Japan's past crimes; unfortunately, it also enables Japan to do the same.

<P>

<LI>Almost every living GOP presidential candidate -- and some whose claim to be  living is questionable -- will have kow-towed to Ross Perot by now. Why?
<P>
It cannot be what he has to say. Now that we have grown used to his snappy (but lacking in nutrition) one-liners, Mr. Perot never says anything interesting, or indeed anything much. 
<P>
Nor can Republicans reasonably think that by proposing to Mr. Perot, they can marry the 19 per cent of voters who supported him in 1992. Mr. Perot was the beneficiary of a large protest vote, not its owner. 
The first Republican to dress down Mr. Perot will advance in the polls. He will have demonstrated the most important asset in politics -- authority.
<P>
Politicians unfailingly fail to grasp this. They imagine that the public wants likable and friendly leaders -- when what it wants above all is strong and decisive leaders. (Okay, okay. Voters would ideally prefer leaders who are both; but a Reagan or an FDR comes along once in a generation.)
<P>
So, the correct strategy for GOP hopefuls in Texas last weekend was to criticize Perot to his face while highlighting the issues his voters care about. 
<P>
Tell me: who did the right thing?


<P>
<LI>Senate rules are meant to cover breaches of a senator's public duty. Boorish actions in private are best dealt with by informal social sanctions such as snubbing. And no doubt decent women did shun Senator Packwood when they learned of his behavior.
<P>
But there is an interesting question that even Senator Barbara Boxer glided over: did his tactic of grabbing the nearest available girl and sticking his tongue into her mouth ever work?
<P>
If not, why did Mr. Packwood employ it for so long? After all, it is such an unpromising experiment that a few consistent failures would persuade most social scientists to try another approach.
<P>
The inference must be that its many humiliations were more than compensated for by a) the occasional conquest, and b) its sheer efficiency (no need of dinner, candlelight, flowers, etc.).
<P>
Will any of these responsive women come forward? Will they testify that it was the senator's power and glamor as a top legislator which led them so to forget themselves? And, if so, will they include those feminists who supported him long after his activities were known because they wanted his vote on abortion, etc.? He could stick his tongue into their PAC any time he chose.
<P>
I would continue on this theme, but it might become tasteless.

<P>
<LI>We know why President Clinton works so hard to make sure no one has a clue where he stands on anything. He figures, if it works for Colin Powell . . .
<P>
After a brief appearance on the Senate floor, Bob Dole's welfare-reform bill was prudently pulled. It was vulnerable to attack from all sides, but especially the Right. More than twenty senators had rallied to a conservative alternative championed by Phil Gramm -- with good reason. The block grants in the Dole bill retained a tangle of strings and sops to the Health and Human Services bureaucracy (the job-training block grant was some 110 pages long and wouldn't have taken effect until July 1998). Its work provisions would have been entirely meaningless if Dole hadn't at the last minute added ``pay for performance'' provisions pushed by Gramm, and they would still have allowed states to count bogus training programs as ``work.'' And the bill lacked crucial provisions to keep federal funds from subsidizing unwed motherhood. (Sen. Packwood reportedly said such restrictions would be a violation of women's reproductive rights.) If the bill had gone forward this month, it seemed likely only to get worse, with Dole promising new child-care measures and GOP moderates angling for a ``maintenance of effort'' requirement to keep state welfare spending at current levels. Better to wait until September, when perhaps the Senate leadership will have embraced welfare reform worthy of the name.
<P>
<LI>There won't be much R&R over the August recess for nervous House Republicans who have been sent home with talking points, charts, and video cassettes to make the case for a radical restructuring of Medicare. In the words of one leadership staffer, the members have been in ``boot camp'' for the past three months, honing a Medicare reform message that will withstand the Democrats' ``Mediscare'' campaign, which alleges that Republicans will slash spending to give tax cuts to the rich. Republicans believe the report issued in April by the Medicare Trustees, which forecast the program's bankruptcy by 2002, convinced the public of the need for reform. A late July CNN/<I> USA Today</I> poll indicates that 65 per cent of respondents believe Medicare has serious problems, warranting ``drastic action.'' Republicans will unveil their plan for Medicare in mid September; meanwhile they are stressing their commitment to the program, to the 40 per cent increase in spending per capita over the next seven years, and to the expanded choices they hope to include in their reform, including Medical Savings Accounts. A final vote is expected within a month of the GOP plan's introduction. As long as it provides the elderly a real choice of coverage, with no bias in favor of managed care, Republicans can fend off the charge that their plan is warmed-over Clintonism using HMOs to ration care. Speaker Gingrich believes that Medicare reform will be the biggest challenge facing his troops in this high-stakes Congress. They're well trained, they're armed with the facts, and they'll have a detailed plan. But with Medicare as the battleground and the AARP aligned with the Democrats, Newt might want to call on the House chaplain too.
<P>
<LI>GOP charges that President Clinton gave the final go-ahead for the deadly tank assault against the Branch Davidian compound in Waco are ridiculous. That would have required making a decision.
<P>
<LI>On September 12, the Reverend Jesse Jackson and the Reverend Al Sharpton plan to hold a prayer vigil outside the home of Justice Clarence Thomas. They want Thomas to ``repent'' his opinions on the Supreme Court. Broadly speaking, Thomas's opinions have reflected his view that the law should be color-blind and his regard for the Tenth Amendment. Jackson and Sharpton apparently view this as not merely mistaken but as sinful. No word yet on whether Tawana Brawley will come to the mourners' bench.
<P>
<LI>The number of shooting murders in New York City has dropped by 40 per cent over the last year. The reason: police keep their eyes open for minor offenders -- subway turnstile jumpers, public drinkers, loud boom-box players -- and then frisk them if they act suspiciously when approached. Gun-toting thugs, scared of losing their guns over a loud rap song, are leaving them at home. Some of the highest-crime areas in the city have not had a single shooting since the program began on June 1. Sadly, instead of praising the police, the New York Civil Liberties Union and other civil-rights advocates have attacked the program as discriminatory toward blacks and Hispanics in poor areas. Well, crime fighting has got to happen where the crime is. Don't break any laws and you won't get frisked. Law-abiding citizens have lived in fear of the thugoisie long enough. It's time thugs feared the law.
<P>
<LI>Republican presidential candidates would rather have gone to the Vatican for an audience with John Paul II than to Dallas for a confab with Ross Perot. You only have to kiss the Pope's ring.
<P>
<LI>As the debate over affirmative action heated up, Jack Kemp urged Republicans not to run ``a campaign that separates people by race and by gender.'' A number of conservatives, including NR, jumped on him for jumping on us (see ``Equality of Opportunism,'' Aug. 14). Responding in the<I> Washington Post</I>, Kemp explains what he means by ``affirmative action'' -- which turns out to be the supply-side gospel. Calling quotas ``antithetical to the genius of the American idea,'' Kemp calls for school choice, reforming the tax code, enterprise zones, and free trade. If he added keeping out unskilled aliens who snap up starter jobs from poor Americans, we'd be perfectly pleased, but four completions in five plays is good work, quarterback.
<P>
<LI>A study on affirmative action carried out for Rep. Pat Schroeder (D., Colo.) concluded that affirmative-action remedies for minorities and women in education have not worked. So she is having the report rewritten to reflect her previous views -- namely that affirmative-action remedies for minorities and women have worked and need to be expanded. Call it affirmative action for disadvantaged ideas.
<P>

<LI>Will the amalgam of three unions -- auto workers, steel workers, and machinists -- wield more power than the sum of its parts? When it comes to lobbying politicians or playing hardball with management, one big slush fund can do far more than three smaller ones. But unionism's decline has little to do with politics or the managerial mindset. Currently only 11 per cent of private employment is unionized. That's less than a third of the peak 36 per cent in 1953. Foreign competition and deregulation of key domestic industries have contributed to the decline. But there has also been a profound change in worker attitudes -- except in the public sector. White-collar workers now constitute a majority in both the service and manufacturing sectors. They reject the notion that management's losses are labor's gains. Not surprisingly, surveys show that white-collar workers overwhelmingly prefer individual representation to union representation. An educated workforce may be the biggest union-buster since the Pinkertons.
<P>
<LI>According to Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart (R., Fla.), Fidel Castro boasts that he has no difficulty blackmailing the U.S. because ``Clinton has no backbone and his knees shake.'' We resent that characterization. We can't necessarily deny it, but we resent it.
<P>
<LI>Last year <I> NR </I>suggested that the International Republican Institute was poorly managed and needed to be shaken up or shut down (``The Week,'' Oct. 10). A flurry of indignant letters assured us that the IRI was in mint condition, and accomplishing near miracles in promoting democracy and human rights abroad. Now it seems that the powers that be have come around to our point of view, for IRI Board Chairman Sen. John McCain (R., Ariz.) fired IRI President Bruce McColm at the beginning of August. But the IRI Board still cannot bring itself to look for first-rate Republican talent. Last time around, a nominating committee talked to GOP foreign-policy hands like Elliott Abrams, Paula Dobriansky, and John Bolton -- then kowtowed when Sen. McCain insisted on Mr. McColm, who, though he had an impressive record in human-rights activities, was not even a Republican. This time, the nominating committee did not bother to meet. Sen. McCain insisted on promoting IRI Vice President Lorne Craner, a former McCain Senate staffer. Mr. Craner may be the man for the job, but his role in the IRI under its last two presidents raises doubts. Apparently IRI Board members get free trips abroad, attend a few meetings, and vote as they are told. Kind of like being Cuba's ambassador to the UN.
<P>
<LI>Jacques Chirac set off a public-relations explosion in June when he announced that France, after a three-year moratorium, would conduct eight underground nuclear tests in the Mururoa coral atoll in French Polynesia. Australia, Japan, and New Zealand have protested and organized anti-French boycotts. The ubiquitous Greenpeace is in the act, too, getting ready to infiltrate the site, even though the environmental risks are negligible: the blasts occur deep in the core of an extinct underground volcano; no radioactivity can escape because the blast's heat vitrifies the rock.<I> Cherchez la politique</I>. Anti-nuclear agitation is always directed against Western defense policies and strategies. (No one pressured China to give up its recent testing.) If Greenpeace can veto French defense decisions, it will try to veto ours next. We back Jacques.
<P>
<LI>China announced that Harry Wu has confessed to stealing files from Vincent Foster's office, setting the fire that destroyed the Branch Davidian compound, and causing <I> Waterworld </I>to go millions of dollars over budget.
<P>
<LI>A recent issue of Wellesley College's alumnae magazine contained an article slamming Harvard's legendary President Charles Eliot as a male chauvinist, claiming that in an 1899 address at Wellesley he had said that women's colleges were ``superfluities.'' A Wellesley alumna looked up Eliot's address. In fact, he had said: ``The colleges for women are still regarded by many people as superfluities.'' He then proceeded to disagree vigorously with that view. The alumna sent the correction to the magazine and to the faculty. She received no answer. The magazine made no correction. Instead it printed gleeful letters to the editor based on the assumption of Eliot's chauvinism. Could a Wellesley freshman hand in an English-comp paper using such shoddy methods? Only in the service of such shoddy ideas.
<P>
<LI>Paragon Cable company of New York had the inspired idea of dealing with deadbeat customers by taking away all channels except C-SPAN, forcing them to pay up or else watch the United States Government at work. Money is pouring in.

<BODY>
<CENTER><H2>Letter from Al</H2></CENTER>
<HR>
28-August-1995
<P>
I'm getting a bigger office! 
<P>
For the past couple of years, space has been pretty tight in the West Wing, so I've made do with a smallish office next to the Private Dining Room -- I've always kept my big office across the street in the OEOB, but to be close to Bill, I've pretty much worked out of the West Wing, in an office so cramped that I couldn't open my ThinkPad all the way. 
<P>
Well, finally, there's a little more room. We've knocked down the wall between what used to be Mandy Grunwald's office and what used to be George Stephanopoulos's office, and connected them to what used to be Stan Greenberg's office (right down the hall from what used to be Paul Begala's office) and what used to be Mark Gearan's office. So my office is a little more roomy -- plenty of room on the couch for Bob Squier -- and the walls are finally thick enough that I won't bug Leon Panetta when I play ``Descent'' on my desktop COMPAQ with the HighRes SoundCard on ``Blaster'' mode. 
<P>
And also, finally, the mood around here is a lot lighter -- and not just because we've got more office space. In all honesty, a lot of that space is earmarked for other things -- Mrs. William Jefferson Clinton, for instance, is giving up her West Wing office to the envelope stuffers for the ``Run, Ross, Run!'' campaign. And Park Rangers and Justice Department investigators have sealed off Mack McClarty's office suite until they have fully investigated his strange and unexplained disappearance. 
<P>
Still, even in the heat of August, everyone's cheery. For one thing, Bill's approval ratings are soaring (mine, I may have mentioned, have held solid at 63% for years and years); and for another . . . well, actually, it's just the approval ratings. But that's enough. Not to brag, but when Bill is reaching Gore-like heights of popularity, well, what can I say? I think Tipper's book proposal, ``Surviving the Worst -- Al and Tipper Gore's Year of Trial'' may be a little premature. 
<P>
We've had a string of foreign-policy non-disasters -- starting with normalizing relations with Vietnam. It was time, Rusty, to heal the wounds from that bloody and troubled time in our nation's history. When I voluntarily gave up my college deferment and voluntarily joined the armed forces to serve my country in a war I didn't agree with -- others made a different choice; hey, time to move on; no judgment here -- little did I know how important it would be in the future to keep the Chinese guessing, and how convenient it would be to do that, thirty years later, by allowing the Vietnamese to purchase fully licensed ``Beavis and Butthead'' paraphernalia. Two birds with one stone, Rusty. Three, if you include Bill's war record, which I don't. 
<P>
The second foreign-policy triumph was in Bosnia. We finally put that conflict to rest. Talk about statecraft! Next issue . . .
<P>
So all in all, as we cruise to Labor Day, things are decidedly on the upswing. The mood is positively giddy. When the Secret Service noticed someone lurking around the West Wing looking ``exactly like the Unabomber,'' they wrestled him to the ground and beat him unconscious with their rifle butts. Turned out it was George Stephanopoulos, who had, unbeknownst to any of us, grown a mustache and beard. The Servicemen apologized and apologized, but George was pretty calm about the whole thing -- he took it in stride. There was a time when something like that would have hit the newswires in an instant, but these days, the media's not terribly interested in George Stephanopoulos. I mean, the guy grew a mustache and a beard and no one even knew it. 
<P>
With the poll numbers looking up, we're all breathing a little bit easier on this whole Whitewater matter. The hearings are still going on, but mostly what they've revealed is that the Clintons had a whole lot of friends and a very wide circle of acquaintances, and many of these friends offered the Clintons -- in friendship -- investment advice. (Arkansas is a hotbed of investing, apparently.) And that most of these friends told some of the acquaintances not altogether the truth about these investments, and in any case, they've complied fully with every request for information, except for the requests they haven't, and the documents are being reviewed. 
<P>
See what I mean? I may as well settle in, because I've got an extra four more years surfing the 'Net from this office coming my way! 
<P>
Gotta go! The whole staff is getting together in one of the empty offices to stuff ``Dole in '96'' envelopes.

<H2>From The Editor</H2></CENTER>
<HR>
<P>
August 14, 1995
<P>
<H3>Little Girl from Little Rock</H3>
<P><LI>Searching for phrases to describe Hillary Rodham Clinton's first newspaper column, I
find myself sounding like a wine snob: ``a certain naive charm,'' ``fresh and green-tasting with
hints of corn,'' and ``needs plenty of time to mature -- keep in a dark place.''
<P>It may not be Mrs. Clinton's own handiwork, of course. It lacks, for instance, the wacky
sophomoric platitudes of her valedictory address at Wellesley  -- the collected works of Marcuse,
Abbie Hoffman, and the Weathermen put through a blender and spread very thin. Nor does it
have any taint of her earnest postdoctoral search for ``meaning.''
<P>Indeed, she seems to have regressed to the fourth grade, where she is now writing about
``places I have been'' and . . . well, read on:
<P>``I also have met a lot of interesting people. Some are famous, like Lady Bird Johnson,
Nelson Mandela, and Mother Teresa. But most are men and women we never hear about who
wake up in the morning'' etc., etc.
<P>Through all Mrs. Clinton's personality changes, however, a certain Essential Hillary shines
though: bossy, determined, ambitious, and out of her depth.
<P>Once she saw a vision on the Road to Woodstock. It turned out to be an hallucination, or at
any rate it has had very disappointing results. But there is another Vision just around the corner
if only we would keep quiet and follow her. Orders have not worked; perhaps a little soft soap
will do the trick.
<P>Hence, ``. . . this column will give me the chance to talk things over in the hope that some of
you will join the conversation.''
<P>Over to you, Florence.



<P><LI>Recent articles in NR have dealt with the delicate question of what powers should be
given to the FBI in a politicized age. Much depends, of course, on how sophisticated the feds
are; Can they distinguish between a Bollinger Bolshevik and the real thing? 
<P>I am indebted to Bob Conquest for guiding me to a footnote by the distinguished
criminologist, Sir Leon Radzinowicz, about a philosophical policeman from Scotland Yard who
did just that.
<P>Sergeant W. Reiners, of the Metropolitan Police Office, called on Karl Marx in London on
August 1, 1874, in connection with his petition to become a British subject. Marx did not fool
the London bobby.
<P>``He is the notorious German agitator, the head of the International Society, and an advocate
of Communist principles,'' wrote the sleuth in his official report, adding significantly: ``He has
not been loyal to his own King and Country.'' Hence, by implication, he was unlikely to be loyal
to Britain's.
<P>Good work, Sergeant. Keep an eye on the blighter.



<P><LI>May I make clear that the non-appearance of the Trans-O-Gram in this and the previous
issue is not my fault. I have to be categorical about this because the last time it happened, I was
verbally assaulted by a Supreme Court Justice, a distinguished historian, and several elected
officials in a public place.
<P>Mr. Kem Putney, our puzzle-maker, is indisposed. We decided not to run an earlier
Trans-O-Gram because its devotees are hawk-eyed (and so would notice) and passionate (and so
would kick up a fuss). But we may be forced to such a recourse if Mr. Putney's indisposition
continues. 
<P>Just don't blame me. 



<P><LI>And now for a real apology. I am indebted to Richard Cowden Guido for correcting my
quotation from Dostoyevsky. He points out that what Ivan Karamazov actually says in Brothers
Karamazov is that without God ``everything is permissible.''
<P>As Mr. Cowden Guido points out: ``It  was Christ who said that everything is possible, albeit
with God, not without Him.'' Not therefore a trivial mistake.
<P>My apologies and my thanks to Mr. Cowden Guido. In future I will try to live up to
journalism's first rule: Always verify.

<P><LI>Announcing he was quitting as <B>Bob Dole</B>'s South Carolina co-chairman to
take same job with Sen. <B>Phil Gramm</B>'s presidential campaign, former congressman
<B>Arthur Ravenel</B> cited as reason Dole's chief of staff, <B>Sheila Burke</B>: ``She's a
former liberal Democrat, and she's still liberal, and it's said she has a great deal of influence over
Senator Dole.'' Noting recent outbreak of articles about Burke's influence on Dole -- including
<B>John Fund</B>'s in <I>Wall Street Journal</I> and <B>Rich Lowry</B>'s in <I>NR --
Washington Post</I> ran story with headline ``Dole's Chief of Staff Is Magnet for Criticism.''
<I>Post</I> also quoted conservative activist <B>Paul Weyrich</B>: ``I was the one to fire the
first salvo. Anything good we've gotten from Dole has been over her dead body.'' . . . Dole,
though, has picked up support from unexpected quarter: Arkansas chicken mogul and former
<B>Clinton</B> buddy <B>Don Tyson</B>, whose spokesman says ``Bill Clinton's election is
the worst thing that has ever happened to Tyson Foods and the state of Arkansas.'' . . . Air of
inevitability to entry of <B>Newt Gingrich</B> into presidential race? Gingrich's recent
emphasis to interviewers that Majority Leader <B>Dick Armey</B> runs House on day-to-day

Fiske said he found no evidence that White House aide <B>Vincent Foster</B> was worried
about Whitewater when he committed suicide. In Foster's handwritten notes which were
available to Fiske, however, the committee found plenty. Fiske was initially recommended for
counsel's spot by ex-Clinton counsel <B>Bernard Nussbaum</B>, who has emerged in
committee hearings as leader of efforts to block police from searching Foster's office. In private

<head><title>IN DISPUTE -- NR</title></head>
<BODY>
<CENTER><H2>
The Cigar, Revisited</H2></CENTER>
<HR>
<P>
WILLIAM A. RUSHER
<P>
August 14, 1995
<P>
Mr. Rusher, NR's former publisher, is a Senior Fellow at the Claremont Institute.
<P>
IN THE special section on ``Pleasure & Its Perils'' in the May 1 issue of NATIONAL REVIEW, our young literary editor, David Klinghoffer, took a swing at ``pretended pleasures.'' He cites two well-known examples: one (the ``white lie,'' as in ``Doesn't the bride look lovely?'') that he approves, and one (which might be called the ``white laugh,'' since it involves laughing at a joke that isn't funny) about which he is somewhat more reserved.
<P>
Then he goes on to scorn -- quite properly, in my opinion -- those who pretend to virtue by admiring what is not admirable but only fashionable (bad foreign films, for example), or by ``abstaining from anything that might prematurely deprive [them] of life in this world: fatty foods, booze, and, above all, cigarettes.'' That sets him up for his final fusillade against water bars, coffee bars, and similar establishments that replace ``the old-fashioned, sinful kind of bar where alcohol and tobacco are ingested.''
<P>
But then Mr. Klinghoffer makes a fatal misstep, complaining that in Manhattan ``The first restaurant for cigar smokers has already opened. . . . Today, one chooses . . . not a cigarette (which is inhaled) but a cigar (which is not). . . . In sticking to safe pleasures such as a cigar, and extolling them as if they were the real thing, a person declares his allegiance to the leading ideology of the day: . . . secular left-liberalism, which took God from us and now seeks to take away even the consolation of genuine pleasure.''
Cigars ``not the real thing''? David, my boy, you have a lot to learn.
<P>
First, let's dispose of the notion that the pleasure of a good cigar must be faked because a cigar isn't inhaled. It's true that a cigar smoker doesn't (simply because he can't) inhale the way a cigarette smoker does: drawing huge billows of smoke into his mouth and thence directly into his lungs, to be exhaled in a great white cloud. Cigar smoke is stronger and thicker than cigarette smoke, and inhaling it that way is simply an invitation to choke.
<P>
But watch a cigar smoker carefully. He will draw smoke from the cigar into his mouth, exhale it gently, and then -- when it has mixed with the air -- inhale a portion of the mixture into his lungs, thereafter exhaling it quietly and almost invisibly. And the air around him will remain perfumed with cigar smoke, and available for further inhalation, almost until he draws on the cigar again.
<P>
In other words, the whole point of smoking a cigar is to savor its aroma and flavor, gentled by the air (and, of course to obtain the agreeable ``nicotine fix'' that all tobacco provides). There is nothing ``pretended'' about it. As a matter of fact, I would argue that smoking a good cigar is one of the most superbly sensual pleasures known to man. (And perhaps spiritual too -- a priest I know calls a cigar ``a sacrament.'')
What's more, just now -- right at the apogee of the national anti-smoking hysteria, when everyone's hand is turned against them -- cigars are making a comeback in the United States that deserves to be called historic. The broader cause is a pronounced upswing in the number of men who have decided to spend a little money on enjoying themselves before they die; but the immediate precipitating factor is a new quarterly magazine called Cigar Aficionado, published by Marvin Shanken, who also publishes The Wine Spectator.
<P>
Shanken is a journalistic genius who is well on his way to cornering the market in magazines catering to those in search of self-indulgent luxury. Simply to thumb through his two publications, reading the come-hither articles and looking at the ads (for everything from humidors to yachts), is to be introduced to a world of unrepentant enjoyment.
<P>
Cigar Aficionado was launched only about three years ago, but it has already led to a humongous boom in cigar sales  -- above all, in sales of the very best cigars. Cigar purveyors are being swamped with orders they cannot fill for months; cigar manufacturers are stepping up production as fast as they can, all too aware that they dare not sacrifice quality lest they ruin the reputation of their finest products. Predictably, cigar prices are going through the roof. But nobody seems to care.
<P>
On April 19 every one of the 31 Ritz Carlton Hotels in the world participated in an ``International Cigar Celebration,'' in the form of a sumptuous black-tie dinner (at $200 a plate) from which those attending took away (if they had not already smoked) eight superb cigars, including a Temple Hall Belicoso, a Partagas Limited Reserve, and a Macanudo Prince of Wales. I was number 54 on the waiting list for the affair at the San Francisco Ritz Carlton until a well-connected friend took pity on me and pulled the necessary strings.
<P>
Telling the two hundred guests at that dinner (most of them not old fogies like myself, but young San Francisco businessmen clearly on their way up) that they were proclaiming their ``allegiance to the leading ideology of the day: . . . secular left-liberalism'' would have invited either hilarity or fisticuffs. I doubt that anybody there was to the left of Newt Gingrich.
<P>
Like anything else, cigars can be overdone. One could, I am sure, smoke too many. (I recently heard of one nonagenarian who has cut back from twenty a day to eight.) And lately, as a result of Marvin Shanken's indefatigable promotion of their pleasures (and perhaps in an attempt to justify the resulting prices), efforts to describe the ineffable characteristics of particular cigars have begun to display the metaphorical excess that has long bedeviled the description of fine wines: e.g., ``filled with cocoa and coffee-bean flavors backed up by smooth woody and leathery notes'' (Cigar Aficionado, Spring 1995).
<P>
But these are quibbles. In the context of contemporary American culture, a good cigar is almost as eloquent as those little American flags that so many of us wore on our lapels in the early 1970s. It proclaims, first of all, that one is an individualist, not easily lured into the deadening conformity of cigarettes -- or, worse yet, into the smug self-righteousness of the health fascists of the anti-smoking brigade. It asserts, second, that the cigar-smoker believes in pleasure, is ready to seek it and spend money on it, and takes time to smell, if not the flowers, then at least the seductive aromas of the humidor. Finally, by its historic identification with good food, it speaks also of a high regard for the delights of the table.
<P>
``Allegiance to secular left-liberalism''? David, what do you think are passed at Bill Buckley's home, after one of Pat's magnificent dinners? What can you hear interfering, every so often, with Rush Limbaugh's enunciation as he sits there at the microphone lecturing his troops?
<P>
De gustibus non est disputandum. But for me, at least, when I have finished lunch and settled into my favorite leather armchair at my club, the Cigar Hour that follows (best of all, of course, with a new issue of NR to read) is the very quintessence of felicity -- and of conservatism.

August 14 1995
<P>

<LI>President Clinton has finally had it with Bosnia. He's thinking of deploying the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.



<P><LI>Item by item, the Contract with America is falling a couple of Republican senators
short of enactment. Regulatory reform is the latest victim. By the time the reform bill hit the
Senate floor in July it had been weakened to such an extent -- no provision for applying the
reforms to current rules; weakened provisions for judicial review of regulations -- that it had lost
the support of free-marketeers like the Competitive Enterprise Institute. Even then it was headed
for trouble with the Democrats. They set up a negotiating troika of John Kerry (Mass.), Carl
Levin (Mich.), and John Glenn (Ohio) that was less interested in compromise than in scuttling
the bill. One list of demands the negotiators submitted to Republicans actually had an asterisk
reserving the right to make more demands -- just in case the current ones were met. Meanwhile,
the OMB's czarina of regulatory affairs, Sally Katzen, kept up a drumbeat of outrageous charges,
while the media, especially ABC News, retailed its own (children dying from tainted meat
topped the list). The GOP response was lost in the buzz. In the end, Bob Dole got all
Republicans, even prodigal moderates like John Chafee, to vote for cloture on the bill. But that
wasn't enough. And it won't be until Senate Republicans get some new colleagues.



<P><LI>In the game of inside baseball, Florida Senator Connie Mack, grandson of the
legendary Philadelphia A's owner, recently hit a grand slam, as Senate Republicans adopted most
of the internal-rule reforms he had been pushing. Henceforth, at the beginning of each new
Congress, Republican senators will vote to adopt an agenda, a mini Contract with America. A
committee's choice of its chairman -- are you listening Mark Hatfield? John Chafee? -- must now
be ratified by a secret vote of the whole GOP conference. And committee chairmen will be
limited to six-year terms. All of this tends to chip away at the senatorial independence that has
made it possible for Republican senators to abandon key provisions of the Contract. Adoption of
the rules is the best thing that could have happened to Senate Republicans this year -- short of
Mark Hatfield's being sent down to the minors.



<P><LI>Yes, we want the Supreme Court rebuked sometime, somewhere. But is the
flag-burning amendment the right time and place? If Congress really wanted to light a fire under
the Court, it would invoke Article III, Section 2 (``. . . the Supreme Court shall have appellate
jurisdiction, both as to law and fact, with such exceptions, and under such regulations as the
Congress shall make''). Passing an amendment concedes the Court's power. Besides, if we need
an amendment to undo every judicial outrage, the Constitution will look like a flea market.
Leave the junk business to the courts.



<P><LI>When Harold Rogers (R., Ky.), chairman of the Commerce, Justice, State, and
Judiciary Subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee, decided to triple funding for
programs instituted by last year's Violence Against Women Act, from $25 million to $75
million, congressional women, including Republican Conference Vice Chairman Susan
Molinari, howled at his stinginess. Any funding below the Clinton Administration's $175-million
request, it seems, is sheer misogyny. Appropriations Committee Chairman Bob Livingston (La.)
-- a good cop working in a bad neighborhood -- tried to stand his ground, but a compromise
eventually sent an additional $40 million into an account for battered-women programs, much of
which will end up in the pockets of the feminist Left. Republicans need this old-style politics
like a fish needs a bicycle.



<P><LI>The White House report on affirmative action includes the following triple-negative
doozy: ``The federal programs . . . do not unduly burden non-beneficiaries.'' In English (we hope
this does not unduly burden non-English speakers), that means the onus that affirmative action
currently imposes on men and whites is, well, due. Call it the white man's burden.



<P><LI>Feminists and gay-rights advocates have taken a new turn into the perverse. Congress is
considering legislation -- put forward by Gary Ackerman (D., N.Y.) and Tom Coburn (R., Okla.)
-- to require states to test newborns for HIV, just as they test for diseases like syphilis and
sickle-cell anemia. The advantages of knowing a baby's HIV status are many. The child can be
treated immediately with AZT, which may reduce his chances of actually developing AIDS. The
mother can avoid breast-feeding, which transmits AIDS. Finally, special precautions can be
taken to protect the child against illnesses like pneumonia. But the sexual radicals don't bother
with details. The proposed testing of babies, the president of the New York City chapter of NOW
recently wrote, ``is just one example of the erosion of a woman's right to control her own [sic]
body.'' Gay-rights activists, meanwhile, don't like the idea of any testing. Forget ``Suffer the little
children.'' Try, Let the little children suffer.



<P><LI>Officials of the Republican National Committee arrived at the office one morning to
discover that most of their issues had been stolen. They were later found in the Oval Office, but
Clinton aides say they have no idea how they got there.



<P><LI>Malcolm S. (Steve) Forbes Jr. is thinking of joining the field of Republican presidential
candidates, and why not? In an earlier era his scant political resume would have been an
automatic disqualification, but when preachers, talking heads, and billionaires seek the Oval
Office, Forbes's eight years as chairman of the Board of International Broadcasting make him
seem like John Adams. Forbes represents the total-immersion wing of the supply-side
movement; his main issues are the flat tax and sound money. He thinks prosperity will solve
many of the problems that underlie the social issues. He is also unimpressed with the Beltway
fixation on balancing the budget. By itself, this seems too meager to serve as a winning formula
for him, or for the GOP. But it was certainly part of Ronald Reagan's winning formula. It would
not be a bad thing to add it to the current Republican mix.



<P><LI>Michael Lind has been described as a man full of learning, information -- and himself.
Evidence of the last appears in a review of Dick Armey's new book, <I>The Freedom
Revolution</I>, in which Mr. Lind blithely accuses the congressman of having ``bungled his
math.'' Armey had written that an individual in the lowest fifth of all incomes in 1979 was more
likely to have advanced to the top quintile ten years later than to have remained mired in the
lowest group. That struck Mr. Lind as a politically inspired howler. It isn't. Armey's statement is
verified by a Treasury Department study that tracked the ups and downs of 14,000 taxpayers
during the Eighties. Treasury found that roughly 17 per cent of the people who were in the
lowest income bracket during a typical Eighties year rose to a higher bracket in the following
year. As a result, only 14 per cent of those people stuck at the bottom in 1979 were still there ten
years later, while 15 per cent had made it to the highest income bracket. These success stories
were mainly baby-boomers, not unlike Mr. Lind himself. Unfortunately, he thinks he's the only
one.



<P><LI>Acting in unseemly haste, the U.S. Congress is voting on whether to move a statue of
some suffragettes up from the Capitol basement, where it has been sitting since 1921.



<P><LI>The banking industry's version of the abominable snowman has been spotted once
again. After massaging data from a notoriously flawed study by the Boston Federal Reserve
Bank, researchers at the Chicago Fed now claim that banks do indeed reject blacks more often
than equally qualified whites. It's not necessarily racism, mind you. William C. Hunter, author of
the latest study, allows as how bank credit officers, who are overwhelmingly white, simply have
trouble relating to applicants who are from different cultural and economic backgrounds. But if
cultural biases are at work, will Mr. Hunter explain why the relative denial rates by race are the
same at black-owned banks as white-owned banks? And why the default rates on loans approved
for blacks and Hispanics are about the same as for whites? Bankers care about money, not race.



<P><LI>``The GOP is on the brink of being embroiled in a bitter and untidy debate about
immigration reform,'' begins Jamie Dettner's story in the estimable <I>Insight</I> magazine. But
Dettner, otherwise perceptive, illustrates one reason for the untidiness. He relies on the Urban
Institute's estimates of immigrant welfare participation and net fiscal impact. But those estimates
are the result of manipulation, as UC San Diego Professor George Borjas showed in the April 17
NR. The Institute eliminates the immigration problem by eliminating problem immigrants -- for
example, Mexicans are removed from the total on the grounds that many are illegal, although
Mexico is also the leading source of <I>legal</I> immigrants. Authors Jeffrey Passel and Barry
Edmonston have yet to challenge Borjas. But in the one-way immigration debate permitted by
our political elite, they probably figure they don't have to.



<P><LI>Rebels in the Sudan captured some UN workers and then, for unknown and
unimaginable reasons, let them go. Like, we want them back or something?



<P><LI>Senator Jesse Helms has proposed a landmark foreign-policy bill that would (among
other things) abolish three semi-autonomous agencies -- the U.S. Information Agency (USIA),
the foreign-aid dispensing Agency for International Development (AID), and the Arms Control
and Disarmament Agency (ACDA) -- and fold their residual functions into the State Department.
The Helms bill has, deservedly, garnered widespread support. But Senator Joseph Lieberman has
offered an amendment that would preserve USIA's autonomy, on the grounds that its unique
``public diplomacy'' function (which includes supervision of the Voice of America) is better
served by a degree of independence from State Department micromanagement. We join many
prominent conservatives -- Jeane Kirkpatrick, Malcolm Wallop, Steve Forbes, Ed Feulner,
Michael Novak, Eugene Rostow, Richard John Neuhaus -- in seconding his motion.



<P><LI>Bill Clinton's effort to tar the Republicans as ``isolationists'' is not working abroad. The
Polish foreign minister met with Senator Dole in mid July and came away with a sense of what's
good for Poland. According to the <I>Financial Times</I>, he ``expressed doubts about the
Clinton Administration's commitment to early NATO enlargement, and suggested that his
government was already looking to a Republican President to make good on the promise after
next year's presidential election.'' All the progess in East - West relations, he added, had been
made under Republican Presidents.



<P><LI><I>New York Newsday</I> folded after ten years, victim of journalistic economics,
and of the lack of a constituency for blue-collar liberalism. In the tabloid's last week on earth,
some PC gnome changed a reference to The Five Blind Boys of Alabama, the black gospel
group, to The Five Blind Men of Alabama. Another year, and it would have been The Five
Visually Challenged Persons of the Cherokee Homeland.



<P><LI><I>Kids</I>, the hot new movie critics call ``frank,'' ``serious,'' and a ``wake-up call to
the world,'' recounts a day in the life of a middle-class white Manhattan teenager, who takes
frightening quantities of illicit drugs, talks in unremitting obscenities, beats a black man
senseless with his buddies, and pursues his hobby of deflowering virgins. He also has AIDS.
<I>Kids</I> is nothing new for the Disney-owned film distributor Miramax and its chief,
Harvey Weinstein, who brought you <I>The Crying Game</I> (adventures of a transvestite),
<I>Pulp Fiction</I> (shocking violence as cool humor), and the Catholic-bashing <I>Priest</I>.
Yet when <I>Kids</I> received an NC-17 rating, Disney pretended to draw the line by refusing
to let Weinstein market it under the Miramax name. So Weinstein set up an ``independent''
distributor called Excalibur. You know -- like <I>The Sword in the Stone</I>.



<P><LI>You are Rodney King. <I>The</I> Rodney King. And you are on a roll. Back in 1991
you led police on a 100-mph chase through Los Angeles and then tried to slug it out with them.
Those guys were rough, but when they were acquitted you had the Big R, man, that's Riot, a
billion-dollar riot. Nobody disses Rodney King any more, man. You are Rodney King. Yes, you
have been picked up twice since then for DWI. Yes, you have been picked up twice for
wife-beating. And, oh yes, you picked up a prostitute who turned out to be a transvestite and so
you tried to run him over. You're on a roll. Maybe you'll star in a movie with Hugh Grant. No
one can put Rodney King in jail, not <I>the</I> Rodney King. They dis Rodney King, they've
got another billion-dollar riot. Hop in. We can get from here to Santa Monica in ninety seconds.
Take a pull on this Old Screech Owl.



<P><LI>From the <I>New York Times</I>: ``Sounding hoarse but robust, President Boris
Yeltsin appeared on television from his hospital room here tonight to prove that while he was
sick, he was not as sick as the Kremlin had led people to believe by insisting he was fine.''

RAMESH PONNURU
<BR><I>
Mr. Ponnuru is NR's national reporter.
</I>
<P>
August 14, 1995
<P>
WASHINGTON, D.C.
<P>
``IF WE oppose set-asides and quotas,'' the memo began, ``we must be willing to support policies that will achieve equal opportunity for all, as opportunity has not been equal and is not currently equal for blacks, women, and others.'' No, the memo wasn't part of the Clinton Administration's internal review of affirmative action. Representative Nancy Johnson (Conn.) sent it to her Republican colleagues, whom she urged to adopt a ``clear, positive message on affirmative action.'' Specifically, she wanted them ``to offer women significant opportunities to compete in sports''; to let universities and employers take race and sex into account; to treat ``evidence of affirmative hiring processes'' as ``presumptive evidence of non-discrimination, encouraging employers to develop these processes''; and to favor ``socially and economically disadvantaged contractors plus women-owned companies'' in federal contracting. Her conclusion: ``Just as quotas are bad, so outlawing any consideration of difference is wrong.'' In other words, scrap preferences -- but keep preferences.
<P>
It's not a very inspiring battle-cry. Mrs. Johnson has at times seemed fearful that even Bill Clinton would go too far in criticizing preferences: she later issued the memo, slightly altered, as a press release directed at him (``Johnson Urges President to Support Affirmative Action Policies That Will Achieve Equal Opportunity for All''). Since her memo reflects the thinking of many liberal Republicans, it may prove difficult to keep them on board for an affirmative-action rollback. Indeed, the problem is not only Republican liberals: the party as a whole has shown little enthusiasm for moving toward a race-neutral legal regime.
<P>
Scrapping affirmative action wasn't supposed to be this hard. Just three months ago, the conventional wisdom held that it was about to crumble. The Congress started promisingly by killing a minority tax break; William Kristol lauded it for ``opening the entire, rusted arsenal of federal 'affirmative action' provisions to real, meaningful debate at last.'' Most of the Republican presidential candidates called for major reform. So did candidate Clinton. The California Civil Rights Initiative, designed to ban racial and sexual preferences in state hiring, contracting, and university admissions, seemed unstoppable, and sure to keep the issue in the spotlight through November 1996. Now Clinton is reaffirming the status quo, Republicans are addressing the issue tepidly if at all, the California campaign is having trouble raising funds, and the ``meaningful debate'' is stalled.
<P>Getting the 700,000 valid signatures necessary for the CCRI to qualify for the ballot will take roughly $1 million. Large Republican donors have not been opening their pocketbooks fast enough to meet that goal. The recent appointment of San Diego businessman Darrell Issa as co-chairman of the campaign may improve the situation. But national Republican leaders have largely failed to respond to requests for help. When Glynn Custred, one of the two academics who proposed the CCRI, visited Washington, D.C., in April to garner support, officials at the Republican National Committee stood him up. Lamar Alexander and Pete Wilson quickly endorsed the measure -- the latter even signing a fund-raising letter for it -- but other Republican presidential candidates have dragged their feet. Wilson's support has brought some disadvantages: by persuading the University of California Board of Regents to abandon racial preferences, he has removed some of the urgency of passing the CCRI. And the initiative has become so associated with his presidential bid that some conservative figures now appear unwilling to aid it.
<P>
ACTIVISTS in Washington have also had reason to doubt the commitment of Republicans. Repeated delays in the introduction of a bill by Bob Dole and Charles Canady to stop mandating preferences in federal hiring, contracting, and program administration have exasperated them. (Dole now promises to introduce it in late July.) A narrower proposal by Phil Gramm to end some federal set-asides by cutting off appropriations for them failed in the Senate thanks to 19 Republican defections. Not a single senator joined Gramm in speaking for the proposal during two hours of debate.
<P>
Clint Bolick of the Institute for Justice, who coordinates conservative efforts on preferences, calls Canady ``a congressional hero . . . both a solid rock and a moving force.'' Hearings before Canady's subcommittee, however, have disconcerted preference opponents. When preference supporters make a foolish or offensive comment, nobody calls them on it. When Democrats verbally abuse witnesses, Republicans don't fight back. Barbara Ledeen of the Independent Women's Forum still fumes recalling her testimony in April: at one point every Republican congressman but Canady left, while all the Democrats stayed. Republicans have been more effective in recent hearings, but the difference in intensity persists.
The Republicans' lack of focus on affirmative action results partly from legislators having their hands full with issues -- like the budget, Medicare, and welfare reform -- that have been deemed more important. In addition, congressmen are unfamiliar with the issue and reluctant to confront it. Democrats see preferences as a bread-and-butter issue politically, while Republicans merely have a mild preference against preferences. And as one staffer explains, ``It's no fun . . . being called racist, being compared to Hitler. There are a lot of weak knees.''
<P>
Some Republicans fear that attacking affirmative action could endanger an imminent breakthrough in black support for the party. David Bositis, who studies minority politics at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, pours cold water on the notion that a breakthrough is around the corner, and suggests that affirmative action would not necessarily prevent one anyway. Blacks willing to listen to what Republicans have to say, he contends, ``would be turned off if it were perceived that the Republicans were approaching this as a wedge issue,'' but not if they ``were going on principle.'' Moreover, at least one-third of black voters have long been skeptical of affirmative action.
<P>
Concern over the black vote has nonetheless led Republicans, including Newt Gingrich and Bob Dole, to seek a ``positive'' message to complement opposition to racial preferences. They want to link repeal to ``empowerment'' measures like school choice and enterprise zones, a tactic with undoubted appeal. Others fear, however, that this tactic both makes empowerment seem a crass, opportunistic ploy to appease blacks and concedes that abolishing racial preferences is a step for which Republicans should apologize. ``Color-blindness is so good in itself that you shouldn't have to link it with anything,'' says John Miller, vice president of the Center for Equal Opportunity. If Republicans want to win black votes, Bolick says, ``The key thing is a Republican presidential candidate who is willing to campaign in black churches, not a cobbled-together legislative package.''
<P>
Miller also complains that nobody is attacking ``the worst violations of color-blindness, the ones that have made the issue'': preferences in college admissions and in the private sector. Republicans are not proposing to change the legal rules that push the private sector toward quotas (e.g., treating employment practices that have a statistically ``disparate impact'' as discriminatory). Those rules were codified in the Civil Rights Act of 1991 with the support of most Republicans, many of them still on the Hill. One staffer notes, ``To require them to change their votes would kill this thing coming out of the gates.'' It would also draw opposition from big business, which has a large stake in current policies.
<P>
Sluggishness on preferences now may make the issue loom larger in 1996 -- an effect some Republican politicians will welcome. But proponents of color-blindness fear that race relations will deteriorate as long as preferences survive, creating opportunities for demagogues of all colors. They want to eliminate preferences now. But first they will have to overcome what Representative Johnson calls ``the proud history of Republicans in creating and using affirmative action.''

<P>
Works in Progress
<P>
<LI>With this issue, NATIONAL REVIEW appears in a splendid new design -- the work of our talented art director, Luba Kolomytseva. We hope that readers find it easy on the eye and enticing to read.
<P>
But further improvements will doubtless occur to Mrs. Kolomytseva after publication. And we are always attentive to suggestions from readers. Consider it a work in progress.


<P>
<LI>Exactly five years ago -- the last time that flag-burning was a political issue -- I wrote on this page: ``. . . [a] constitutional amendment would paradoxically make the flag a symbol of national disunity and partisan passions over two long years. It would be better perhaps to allow the odious antics of a few America-haters to remind the other 247 million Americans of the fundamental patriotism that unites them.''
<P>I am inclined to be even more liberal today. There has been little flag-burning in the last five years -- perhaps because the ``odious antics of a few
America-haters''<I> have</I> reminded the other 247 million Americans of the fundamental patriotism that unites them. Certainly the election results suggest so.
<P>More significantly, if expressive actions are a form of speech protected by the First Amendment, then common sense suggests that flag-burning is indeed closer to the political speech the Founding Fathers thought they were protecting than expressive actions such as nude dancing.
<P>Of course, I do not grant that expressive actions <I>are</I> constitutionally protected speech. But since I seem to have lost that battle, let me exploit my defeat.
<P>If flag-burning is protected by the First Amendment, so surely are cigar- and cigarette-burning. They clearly express hostility to the puritan regulation of our pleasures by a politically correct New Class of bureaucrats. 
<P>This argument seems stronger if the smoker is a non-smoker because his motives are presumably less mixed. The smoker might be smoking for enjoyment rather than for protest. But such an objection is easily countered: the right to free speech has never been invalidated on the grounds that the speaker liked the sound of his own voice (though, come to think of it . . . ).
<P>So, light up. You are employing your constitutional right to free speech -- and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.


<P>
<LI>O'Sullivan's Law -- ``An organization that is not explicitly right-wing will become left-wing over time'' -- continues to be confirmed by reality. 
<P>The latest organization to illustrate it is Action for Children's Television. Back in 1971, ACT asked the Federal Communications Commission to exercise greater control over television programming because (among other reasons) ``parents, no matter how attentive, sincere, or knowledgeable, are not in a position to really exercise effective control'' over what programs their children see. 
<P>By 1987, 1990, and 1994, however, ACT was leading the charge in challenging FCC bans on the late-evening broadcasting of indecent programs. It now took the view that children were at home during those hours and parents were able to supervise their TV fare.
<P>Lights! Camera! Inaction!


<P>
<LI>Friends are pressing me to run for President, but I am as yet undecided. 
<P>They argue, very plausibly, that with Jack Kemp sitting this one out, no candidate represents the upbeat, optimistic, generous-hearted spirit of the modern Republican Party. That I possess these qualities almost to excess will be confirmed by my bankers. On the other hand, February in New Hampshire is extremely cold, and I do not ski. 
<P>
The choice is a finely balanced one. I shall ponder my options through the summer, exploring the national mood through the pages of the
<I>Manchester Union-Leader</I> and working on the problem of how it is that taxes always seem to rise even when they fall. 
<P>Come Labor Day, I shall either announce for President, or not, as the mood takes me.

<H2><CENTER> Was Ames A Mortal Blow?
</CENTER></H2>
<HR>




<P>
NEW YORK, JULY 4
<P>

A legislator who is critically important on such questions as who gets U.S. funding managed a very brief exchange at an affair too noisy to permit fine conversational calibrations. He asked, ``Do you think the CIA can be saved?'' I murmured that I hoped so. He shook his head mournfully. ``I don't think so, not after Ames.''<P>
The reference was to Aldrich Ames. Four books about his treachery were reviewed over the weekend in the <I>New York Times</I> and most of what was said was vaguely familiar, including that ten Russians were martyred at his dirty hands. Less prominent in the memory was the extraordinary behavior of CIA security. Ames disguised himself about as subtly as King Kong, but it seemed that there was nothing he could do blatant enough to attract the attention of the agency whose mission it is to protect the security of the United States and protect the friends of freedom who risk their lives by joining the resistance movement. During those days, 1985 - 91, Mr. Ames feared one thing. Not the CIA or the FBI or the OMB. He feared that friends of the men he was betraying, month after month, would notice the gory disappearance of a member of the resistance and advise Washington that obviously there had been a betrayal. One or two such signals did get through, but it occurred to nobody in charge at the CIA to rope in the alcoholic traitor even though he had become so carefree in his habit that he removed from Langley not discreet copies, but the original documents identifying our hidden friends in the Soviet Union. 
<P>
One recalls the trauma in Great Britain when they caught on to Kim Philby, the traitor who gleefully consigned to death any number of British patriots. Eventually Philby wrote his memoirs, and the reviewer for the <I>Daily Telegraph</I> was Lord Birkenhead, gone to the House of Lords after a legendary record as a trial lawyer. Birkenhead wrote: ``We shall never know how many agents were killed or tortured as a result of Philby's work as a double agent. He is now safe in Russia, and we must, alas, abandon any wistful dream of seeing this little carrion gibbeted.'' Well, Ames isn't in Russia, but we don't hang our traitors.
<P>
Nor, the authors of the Ames books advise us, do we do very much about those who made possible the extravagant treason of Ames. The question seriously arises whether the Agency itself can be rescued. 
<P>
The view is widely held that James Jesus Angleton was the dominant figure in the collapse of CIA security. This is ironic, because Angleton is associated with the sternest of views on security. He was an intellectual, a poet, a gourmet, an aesthete, and a very tough hombre. He had been a close friend of Kim Philby, and when he learned that Philby was a traitor, it affected his powers of reasoning. He became so suspicious, he thought almost every approach by a Russian official was a venture in double agentry. He approached me, on one occasion, requesting support for the publication of a book whose thesis was that the break between Moscow and Peking was a phony, concocted to conceal the ongoing Communist monolith. When he came to my house, the Russian author he desired me to meet, who came in a separate car, was given instructions on an order of exactitude I'd have been embarrassed to write into any of my spy novels. 
<P>
But whatever the causes of disrepair, one hopes that Congress will not go so far as to drop the CIA. Reforms are presumably needed, and were attempted by the Church Committee in 1975, but these were largely miscast, requiring a degree of intimacy between the Executive and the Legislative that is unrealistic.
<P>
But the point is that continued intelligence is critical. Whether Mr. Deutsch,  the new director of the CIA, can get the job done isn't known, though his credentials are good; and it is true that a job worth doing is worth doing even badly.
<P>Thanks to Mr. Ames, it may be another generation before a freedom-loving North Korean, Chinese, Iraqi, Iranian, or Libyan takes the risk of sending secrets for the benefit of the United States. But making the effort to penetrate to the secret designs and resources of such countries would appear to be a strategy more important, even, than an auto-da-fe over our mishandling of the traitor Ames.

31-July-1995



<P>
<LI>A Kansas judge has given permission to exhume the remains of Jesse James. First Zachary Taylor, then John Wilkes Booth, now James. They'll be going for Al Gore next.
<P>
<LI>If good things come to those who wait, the Republican assault on affirmative action will be something to behold. A bill to ban preferences in federal hiring and contracting is said to be forthcoming from Representative Charles Canady (R., Fla.) and, more importantly, Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole. But it was supposed to be forthcoming before -- namely in late June, until Dole abruptly canceled the press conference he had called to announce his bill. Behind some of the GOP skittishness is the idea that large numbers of minority voters are on the verge of joining the GOP (``We are very close to a major breakthrough with black voters,'' one House leadership aide explained to the Washington Times), and that attacking affirmative action will alienate them. Maybe. And maybe not -- polls have always shown large numbers of black Americans opposed to racial quotas. But whatever the politics, abandoning race neutrality as a principle would be too high a price to pay for a breakthrough with anyone. Speaker Newt Gingrich says he understands this and pledged in a recent letter to the New York Times that it is his intention that ``the final [GOP] policy reflect the historic American ideal that personal success and happiness are best achieved through individual liberty and equal justice under the law.'' We're waiting.
<P>
<LI>John Stuart Mill thought that recipients of government benefits shouldn't be allowed to vote -- they're too self-interested. But should they lobby? Legislation proposed by GOP Representatives David McIntosh (Ind.), Ernest Istook (Okla.), and Bob Ehrlich (Md.) would prevent any organization that receives federal funds from spending more than 5 per cent of its non-federal income on political advocacy. Representative Bob Dornan (Calif.) goes further. He would cut off all tax-exempt advocacy groups like the American Association of Retired Persons from federal grants (in FY1994 the AARP got $73 billion in federal support). Meanwhile, neither charitable non-profits nor for-profit corporations could lobby on any matter related to any federal grants or contracts they receive. Both proposals hit the Left where it lives, so they're meeting outraged opposition on Capitol Hill -- with innocuous groups such as the YMCA taking the lead. But something along Dornan/McIntosh lines is essential to short-circuit the self-perpetuating government machine in Washington. The last thing government should be subsidizing is efforts to make it larger.
<P>
<LI>Donors who pony up $100,000 for the Democratic Party will be rewarded with a dinner with President Clinton. Those donating $50,000 also get to eat with the President, but Hillary shows up.
<P>
<LI>William Bennett, in an interview with The New Yorker, discussed his fellow social conservative Pat Buchanan. ``The worst place to stand in a fight is . . . as someone who was on his side but has now deviated by one step. It's a pathology of small differences with him. A real S&M kind of thing.'' Bennett then repeated charges that some of Buchanan's remarks have been ``flirting with'' fascism. ``This Fortress America stuff, this You the People stuff -- I think it's tricky.'' Tricky indeed, if it makes conservatives resort to left-wing arguments when they disagree. If slightly misquoting the Preamble to the Constitution is flirting with fascism, who is preoccupied with small differences? Mr. Bill wants clients who have been very bad.
<P>
<LI>Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, who submits his own versions of any promising Republican legislative initiatives, has come up with a truly Gephardtian ``flat tax.'' It has five tax brackets, just like the present tax code. The brackets are progressive, also like the present code. The rich get soaked, also like . . . But the rates are, like, rounder numbers, or something. The only thing flat about the tax is how it will fall.
<P>
<LI>Until July 10, every cent that everyone in the country earned was taxed away. Government at all levels takes 52 per cent of net national product. Only this week did we start holding on to what we earn. You may wish to keep these details in mind as you follow the debate in Washington, D.C., which is not about taking less, but about whether to slow the rate of taking more.
<P>
<LI>School choice is taking off in Milwaukee. For the last five years, an experimental program involving 800 children (1.5 per cent of the district's students) has distributed to their families vouchers worth $3,209 each, which can be applied to tuition at private non-sectarian schools in the city. Two weeks ago, the Wisconsin legislature approved Governor Thompson's request to expand the program. Allocated funds will increase from $2.4 million to $14.7 million; 7,000 students will be included, with an increase to 15,000 for the 1996 - 97 school year; and parents will be allowed to use the vouchers at religious schools. Naysayers dispute the benefits of the program, and tremble for the future of the public-school system. But consider: the program saves the state money (because private schools are almost all more efficient); parents are involved in the schools and report overwhelming satisfaction; and the quality of education is at least commensurate if not superior. RIP the public-education monopoly; long live public education.
<P><LI>
As the debate over normalizing relations continues, the White House hasn't decided whether it would be better for President Clinton or the Democratic Party to make the first move toward the other.
<P><LI>
John Major won his gamble and is still prime minister, but the balloting showed that at least a third of Tory MPs wished to be rid of him. Startling too, reports our London correspondent, Anthony Lejeune, was the near unanimity with which Conservative newspapers called for a new leader and new policies. The Majorettes now boast that their media foes were discomfited, although whether Gadarene swine should congratulate themselves on having brushed aside herdsmen crying ``Stop!'' seems doubtful. In the subsequent cabinet reshuffle Major's right-wing critics were excluded while Michael Heseltine, his potential challenger from the Left, was enthroned as deputy prime minister. And on policy Mr. Major has categorically refused to alter course. So the profound ideological split, over Britain's increasing absorption into the European Union and over its tax-and-spend policies, gapes as wide as ever. If the Conservatives had been defeated at the last election, they might now be undergoing a Republican-type revival. If they lose the next one (as, in the light of their present unpopularity, seems probable), something similar may happen. Mr. Major, meanwhile, proposes to fight on the soggy middle ground.
<P><LI>
``Rapid Reaction Force Delayed'' -- headline, British Press Association, July 5.
<P><LI>
Excited crowds gathered around newsstands as the July Fourth holiday approached, all asking the same question: Would the Wall Street Journal editorial page (Robert L. Bartley, proprietor) dare to repeat its call for a constitutional amendment proclaiming ``There Shall Be Open Borders''? This high-water mark of loony libertarianism (apart from anything else, what about disease? welfare eligibility? education costs?) first appeared a few years ago and was repeated several times. It seemed intended as an instant July Fourth tradition. But it was conspicuously absent last year, perhaps because of the obvious imminent rout of immigration enthusiasts in California's Proposition 187 campaign. And the Journal blinked this year too. The disappointed crowds had to be content with an editorial extolling the virtues of skilled immigration. Which, of course, implicitly concedes NR's point that one of the ways in which the current system is fatally flawed is precisely that skilled immigration has been choked off by the misnamed ``family reunification'' provisions of the 1965 Immigration Act. The Journal says a Great Debate on immigration has begun, although the other side is notoriously absent from its pages. Not by Eastern Seaboard windows only, when daylight comes, comes in the light.
<P><LI>
Hugh Grant became the Cary Grant/Fred Astaire of the Nineties by playing charming, diffident men who explicitly included bedding down in their badinage. In real life, he had lived for eight years with a beautiful model, reinforcing his image. Then in real life two vice cops caught him in a car performing a ``lewd act'' with a hooker. Has an illusion left us? That unregulated passion can somehow be confined to charming encounters? The difficulty of so confining it is why Cary and Fred's love interests always maneuvered them toward wedding rings -- not that they would ever have been so crude as to propose doing without them.
<P><LI>
Weighing the messy options, journalistic and ethical, the New York Times began printing the Unabomber's manifesto in 800-word installments, signed ``Frank Rich.''
<P><LI>
Lord Thou Hast Delivered Our Enemies into Our Hands Department: The American Civil Liberties Union recently took out a four-page advertisement in The New Republic. Each page addresses a contentious issue and asserts that the American public agrees with the ACLU that organized school prayer is impolitic, that gays should have special legal recognition, that marijuana use should be legal, and that women should have the right to an abortion. At the bottom of the first three ad pages is the logo ``The American Civil Liberties Union,'' underlined by the phrase ``Live and Let Live,'' picked out in white on a bold black bar. However, on the final page -- the one that defends abortion rights -- the phrase ``Live and Let Live'' is somehow missing. Aborted, you might say.
<P><LI>
Representative Patricia Schroeder (D., Colo.) says the attempt in the House to make partial-birth abortions a felony reminds her of the old days when women were persecuted as ``witches.'' It's easy to see why Representative Schroeder took refuge in similes. The partial-birth abortion -- in which a fetus more than five months old is pulled out of its mother feet first up to its neck and then has its brains suctioned out with a catheter to collapse the skull -- is as grotesque as abortion gets. Perhaps the most striking report on the subject was a New York Times article which quoted an abortionist as saying that some mothers find partial-birth abortions comforting because afterward the body can be ``dressed and held'' to allow a chance to ``say goodbye.'' All the debates about the medical nuances of this relatively unusual surgery (does the fetus die painfully during the suction process, or is it killed beforehand?) fade away beside the image of a nurse dressing the tiny, mutilated corpse in baby's clothing and handing it over to the mother for a ``goodbye'' kiss. This picture should bring instant revulsion to any human being whose brain hasn't been sucked out with a straw.

<P>Greatness in Flushing Meadows
<P>JEFFREY HART 
 
 <HR><B>
<P>1939: The Lost World of the Fair, by David Gelernter (Free Press, 418 pp., $23) 
 </B><HR>
 
<P>Mr. Hart is a senior editor at NR. 
 
 
IF YOU frequent large and miscellaneous antique shows, you learn all sorts of things from old memorabilia. 
Some are surprising, such as that Bill McKinley was the most beloved of all American Presidents. Other 
things are not so surprising, such as that the New York World's Fair of 1939 - 40, at Flushing Meadows, 
was probably the most brilliant fair of all time, including the Great Exhibition in Hyde Park in 1851. I went 
to it almost every day, and I don't need the memorabilia to tell me how important it was.
<P>Which brings me to 
David Gelernter's book, whose subtitle should be noted: <I>The Lost World of the
Fair</I>. His subject is the lost 
world of the later 1930s as much as it is the Fair itself.
<P>
I cannot do more than begin to suggest here the 
richness of his treatment. In the New York City of 1939 that he paints here the subways and streets were not 
only safe but clean. In that city there were only forty murders per year; just think of that. Executions were 
very prompt. Manners at all levels were more formal than ours. In the middle and upper classes, men wore 
suits and ties. Women never wore shorts. There were rituals about when to touch your hat and when to take 
it off, correct modes of introduction, established rules governing interaction between the sexes. Men
<I>always</I> 
remained standing until the last woman was seated. Gelernter calls this an ``ought'' culture to contrast it with 
our ``want'' culture -- not an altogether satisfactory choice of terms, but pretty good.
<P>
He notices that art, 
technology, and their cousin, design, were allied, and shrewdly sees that this was because people wanted to 
get things done and expected to do so. Engineers were heroes. Among his greatest doers were Robert 
Moses, the master builder; Fiorello LaGuardia, the mayor; and Franklin Roosevelt, the President -- all men 
of authority, a key word here.
<P>
Mr. Gelernter believes that, since the time of the Fair, authority has 
evaporated. He is certainly correct in this, but he offers no theory to explain it. Perhaps it has something to 
do with the circumstances we live in. Could LaGuardia himself have kicked off West 96th Street that 
``homeless'' maniac who terrorized the neighborhood for months? Could LaGuardia have cut through the 
years of fuss and actually put pissoirs on New York's streets? Could Robert Moses, of Jones Beach, the 
Triborough Bridge, countless playgrounds, and magnificent public swimming pools, have rescued Times 
Square or even built a new highway on the West Side?
<P>
Mr. Gelernter is good, but also not entirely 
satisfactory, on the Fair itself. His device for taking us there is a fictitious diary by a bright young woman 
who went to the Fair. This does not quite rise to the subject, nor does Mr. Gelernter's own excellent 
research. He should have looked at the Fair more closely, more continuously and intensely. Yet meaning 
after meaning emerges.
<P>
The hero of the Fair was George Washington, whose large though banal statue 
graced the place: the Father of His Country, the very image of authority. Then you had the Trylon and 
Perisphere, by the great firm of Harrison and Fouilhoux. Let us explicate.
<P>
The Trylon was, by Fair 
regulations, the tallest structure there. No other was allowed to be as tall. Of course you can guess what the 
second tallest structure was: the Soviet pavilion with the Worker atop. He held aloft a huge red star that 
gazed angrily at night toward the Trylon and Perisphere, which were gleaming white but sometimes bathed 
in pastel colors.
<P>
The Soviet pavilion was a depressing and heavy hulk of Stalinist imperial architecture. All 
that I can remember from inside were some folk dancers and a replica station from the Moscow Metro, 
chandeliers and all. You can probably imagine my reaction, even at age 9, to the aesthetics here. Good old 
Ivan -- the Worker -- was a stitch. He had a thick neck and thick wrists, infallible signs of proletarian virtue. 
He seemed disconcertingly stupid. Ah, this was what Stalin was putting up against the Trylon and 
Perisphere? At 9, I became an anti-Communist at a glance.
<P>
An adult, meanwhile, would have seen that the 
Trylon and Perisphere were not casually conceived some lazy afternoon down at Harrison and Fouilhoux. 
He would have seen that they were a climax of High Modernism, perhaps its greatest architectural 
achievement. In their geometric character, they represented pure Mind. Henri Matisse had held that all 
spatial forms could be resolved into triangles, spheres, and cubes: the beginning of Cubism. The Eiffel 
Tower had famously insulted the low mansard roofs of Paris. Architects connected with European 
formalism had experimented with huge spires as images of aspiration, and one had even been submitted in a 
design for Coney Island. Wallace Harrison and Andre Fouilhoux (Wally and Andy to their architect friends) 
knew all this and figured out how to bring it to a brilliant result.
<P>
What did the two gigantic monuments 
mean? George Washington, the Father of His Country, had his Egyptian obelisk, a symbol of maleness, in 
Washington, D.C. This had to be retained, but also transformed. The four-sided obelisk became the three-
sided Trylon. (Ezra Pound: ``Make it new.'') Meanwhile, just as the Trylon was a representation of 
masculinity, the globular Perisphere was pregnant with The World of Tomorrow, a giant model inside 
named ``Democracity.'' Between the Soviet pavilion on the one hand, and the Trylon and Perisphere on the 
other, the Fair symbolized the greatest conflict of our age, and suggested its resolution.
<P>
Much of what this 
model, and the rest of the Fair, foresaw came to pass. That poor Soviet Worker, with his thick wrists and 
thick skull, did not stand a chance against the energy and creativity of the West, represented by Harrison 
and Fouilhoux. Neither, ultimately, did the regime that shipped him here in crates. If the poor clod could 
have escaped from his Stalinist perch, I like to think he would have headed for the Parachute Jump, the 
Aquacade, and the Voyage to Mars, picking up a Zombie (a drink that was ``one to a customer'') on the 
way.
<P>
The Fair was consciously designed to represent optimism and brains at home to the cruel new utopias 
so menacing abroad. Maybe that is why we cared about it so much. The good news is that the Fair -- 
brilliance, energy, speed, electronics, intelligence -- won.

The 101st Senator<BR>
Rich Lowry<BR>
<P>

Mr. Lowry is NR's national political reporter.
<P>
WASHINGTON, D.C.
<P>SHEILA Burke stands at a phone in her spacious Capitol office, looking down as she listens to an 
unhappy senator on the other end. The senator went home last night not realizing floor votes are scheduled 
today, and wants to know why he wasn't informed. Mrs. Burke apologizes, then explains that a notice went 
to every office last night outlining today's schedule. When she sits back down for an interview, she's still 
shaking her head. ``Told him there would be votes. He left. Now he's mad there's votes,'' she sighs. ``The 
freshmen are just . . . an interesting crowd.''
<P>
Bob Dole's chief of staff can afford some exasperation over the mistakes of first-year Senators -- not only 
has she been here longer, she's probably more powerful. The shortish 44-year-old mother of three, who 
typically wears a dour expression -- as if one of the kids had just tracked mud on the living-room carpet -- is 
often called the ``101st senator,'' in recognition of the latitude given her in running the day-to-day 
operations of the Senate. Conservatives often call her other, less flattering names, ranging from ``liberal 
Democrat'' to the ``woman who runs Bob Dole.''
<P>``The one consistent theme over every major battle that conservatives lost,'' says a former Senate 
staffer, ``was a knife in the back from Bob Dole, frequently at the behest of Sheila.'' A Traditional Values 
Coalition press release recently proclaimed, ``If the American people like Hillary Clinton, they will love 
Sheila Burke,'' an over-the-top piece of rhetoric that nonetheless captures her place in the pantheon of 
conservative villains. As the Dole campaign continues to roll, neutralizing serious opposition on the Right, 
Mrs. Burke stands as a personification of all the old conservative doubts about the convictions and the 
<I>modus operandi</I> of her boss. 
<P>Sheila Burke, a nurse by training, joined Dole in the mid 1970s. At the time, she was a Democrat with, 
as she told <I>U.S. News & World Report</I> last year, ``a bias on the liberal side.'' Her resume included time 
protesting the conservative reign of S. I. Hayakawa as president of San Francisco State and involvement in 
``Nurses for Moynihan.'' No matter. Dole, she says, ``was looking for somebody to do health policy who 
had experience as a provider.'' When in 1985 he was elected majority leader, Mrs. Burke left the Senate 
Finance Committee, where she handled health care, to become his deputy chief of staff. In 1986 she moved 
into the top slot. 
<P>Mrs. Burke's politics had shifted rightward -- ``a maturation on my part,'' she says -- but retained an 
accommodationist/liberal tinge in keeping with her Senate background. The Finance Committee, which 
spends half the federal budget and raises almost all of it, is in the minds of its members a domain too 
important for partisanship. ``She is the Finance Committee,'' one Senate aide says. ``In the Finance 
Committee, people who come to the table with strongly ideological agendas, whether liberal or 
conservative, are marginalized. I think her temperament and approach to issues comport very well with the 
way the committee does business.''
<P>And with the way the Senate does business. Sheila Burke is part of what one aide calls an ``Old Boys 
Network'' of staff loyal to the traditional non-confrontational ways of the Senate (the staff director of the 
Budget Committee was recently described by <I>National Journal</I> as ``deeply perplexed by what he viewed as 
a right-wing takeover of the House''). For Mrs. Burke, the most important boys in this network have been 
women, including Finance Committee staff director Lindy Paull and, until she left to be Rhode Island's 
Director of Human Services, John Chafee aide Christine Ferguson. It's a vaguely feminist, non-ideological 
environment.
<P>All of which has made Sheila Burke, whose intelligence and competence are not in question, a 
lightening rod for conservative suspicions. Whenever Dole strays, Sheila Burke gets fingered. Supporters 
contend this is unfair. ``Dole is his own person,'' says conservative activist Don Devine. Former Finance 
Committee staff director Bob Lighthizer insists, ``Nobody who succeeds working for Senator Dole elevates 
their own agenda above his. He just doesn't tolerate it.'' But Dole tends to have a hands-off management 
style; ``work it out'' can constitute a marching order. It's within this latitude of broad instructions and the 
detailed staff work surrounding any issue that Mrs. Burke has her influence.
<P>CONSERVATIVE critics point to her role in the health-care reform fight of 1993 - 94 as the prototype. 
She maintains close ties to a nursing community not prone to right-wing views, sometimes teaching courses 
at nursing schools. ``The people she sees socially tend to have a corporatist liberal point of view,'' says one 
observer. That background has made itself felt in a variety of ways, from Sheila Burke's personally twisting 
senators' arms to get them to agree to sell a valuable piece of federal land to the Columbia Hospital for 
Women in Washington, D.C., to her interest in becoming head of the Health Care Financing Administration 
(HCFA) in the Bush Administration.
<P>At first blush an odd career move, the HCFA job might have represented a fulfillment of Sheila Burke's 
ambitions (she couldn't take it because her husband's work with Aetna represented a potential conflict). The 
agency runs Medicare and Medicaid; ``it controls American health care,'' explains one staffer.
A chance to do the same by different means came in the health-care fight. Mrs. Burke's friends fashioned 
the Chafee proposal, a pre-emptive surrender to the Clinton plan that would, among other things, have 
required insurers to offer a set of government-defined benefits. At first called Dole -  Chafee, the legislation 
represented the initial instincts of Dole and the policy convictions of his chief of staff. ``Sheila was very 
comfortable with the Chafee bill,'' says one GOP aide.
<P>AS THE health debate moved right, conservatives worried that Mrs. Burke was pulling the other way. 
She achieved unusual visibility for a staffer. On <I>Meet The Press</I> in the fall of 1993 Senator Pat Moynihan 
proclaimed, ``Sheila Burke . . . said this is an important moment. . . . We agree that government now has to 
intervene.'' Come February 1994 Hillary Clinton was hawking the same line: ``Senator Dole told me, 'If you 
and Sheila can agree, I'll vote for the plan.''' Mrs. Burke seemed to be itching to cut the deal. ``If you didn't 
want to take care of this stuff, these [health-care] issues were of such a technical nature that it was a 
discussion you could easily beg off,'' says a former Democratic staffer. ``[But] she was interested in sitting 
down with the other side and getting into all the details.''
<P>When Dole finally decided to sink any version of government-run health-care -- after getting pounded 
privately by conservative colleagues -- Mrs. Burke did dutifully assemble the operation to do it. ``I've never 
seen in my six years up here anything that approached it for sophistication, level of organization, and 
effectiveness,'' says Doug Badger of the Senate Republican Policy Committee. By the end of the process, it 
was the moderates who were complaining. Says former Chafee aide Christine Ferguson: ``I feel like she 
abandoned the ship.'' The overall trajectory of the health-care fight followed a familiar pattern: first (at the 
point when an issue is most likely to be shaped by his staff) Dole gets on the wrong side, then he rights 
himself (when other, outside influences have been brought to bear).
<P>The latest complaint about Sheila Burke comes on welfare. Conservative staff contend she has worked 
in staff-level meetings to limit welfare reform and keep the bill free of language condemning illegitimacy, 
even an innocuous statement like ``marriage is the foundation of a successful society.'' Mrs. Burke says she 
just tried to broker an issue on which the Republican conference is bitterly divided (so-called ``clean'' block 
grants v. those with some illegitimacy strings). But, as on health care, being a good soldier will mean 
crossing her instincts: the ineffective reforms of 1988, which must be scrapped to make way for any 
meaningful change this year, would not have happened without her.
<P>The welfare controversy is typical, based on impossible-to-discern intentions and a pervasive distrust. 
``It's the sense you get of the meeting before the meeting,'' says one aide, ``that her more liberal friends are 
there when you arrive -- and still there when you leave.'' Stories of her betrayals in the Senate cloakroom are 
as rife as they are difficult to confirm. Eyewitnesses recall seeing her pow-wow in late 1992 with Nancy 
Johnson (Conn.) and Fred Upton (Mich.), as the two House moderates made a last minute push for a fetal-
tissue research bill. A similar allegation -- in writing, in an unsigned memo -- had her helping cloakroom 
staff find the votes to shut down a Jesse Helms filibuster last year. ``An absolute falsehood,'' she says. ``I 
wasn't there.'' 
<P>The strained relations with the Right may have contributed to Mrs. Burke's brief move this year to the 
position of Secretary of the Senate, a powerful institutional job, but one removed from Dole's political shop. 
The Dole campaign, went the speculation, was trying to ease her out. But Mrs. Burke kept her chief-of-staff 
job, and by June had moved back to it full-time. Her 18 years of loyal service no doubt stood her in good 
stead, as on a deeper level did her sympathy with Dole. She represents a part of him, if the ``bad'' part: the 
tough-as-nails demeanor, when the ``New Dole'' is supposed to be kinder and gentler, the pragmatic 
operator, when Dole is supposed to be an avatar of conservative principle.
<P>In recent months, Mrs. Burke has presided over an office churning out a steady diet of conservative 
results, most recently beating cloture on the Henry Foster nomination for Surgeon General. But she is 
clearly acting from the head rather than the heart. Asked whether she understands the nation's new political 
currents, Mrs. Burke says. ``There are a lot of things people accuse me of, but being stupid isn't one of 
them.'' The same can be said of her boss, which at least partly explains his compelling rhetoric of late. But 
after the campaign speeches are a distant echo, Sheila Burke (the next White House chief of staff?) will still 
be around. So will the side of Bob Dole that makes her such a good fit.

<H2>LEGALIZING DRUGS: JUST SAY YES</H2></CENTER>
<P>
Legalizing drugs may be the way to help
addicts, and win the drug war. 
<P>
AN INTERVIEW WITH MICHAEL S. GAZZANIGA
<P>
Dr. Gazzaniga is Director for the Center of Neuroscience at U.C. Davis.
<P>
NATIONAL REVIEW: Professor Gazzaniga, thank you for talking with us again [cf. 
``The Federal
Drugstore,'' <P>NR, Feb. 5, 1990]. We would like to examine the possible consequences 
of legalizing drugs
in America. However, before we take up this controversial issue, perhaps you 
can sketch a quick picture
of drug use today?

<P>DR. MICHAEL S. GAZZANIGA: The current figures suggest that about 10 per cent 
of Americans use
illegal drugs. Of course, the vast majority of these users -- perhaps as many 
as 90 per cent -- are not
addicted to drugs and use them only infrequently. There is also a strong correlation 
between age and drug
use. In surveys, 13 per cent of 18- to 25-year-olds claim to have used drugs 
in the past thirty days, while
a meager 4 per cent of people over age 26 say they have done so. So, while 
a substantial number of people
have experimented with drugs in one way or another, very few become addicted.
<P><BR><B><P>NR</B>: Are there any studies that help to explain why people take drugs -- and 
why they don't?
<BR><B><P>MG</B>: Human psychology is very complex; obviously, many factors go into the decision. 

Not
surprisingly, the dominant factor seems to be simply the short-term pleasure 
of the drug experience. In
other words, drugs make people feel good. This simple fact is what causes people 
to take these
substances, sometimes at great medical and social risk. The long-term consequences 
are just not present
in their minds at the moment of arousal.
<BR><B><P>NR</B>: Nevertheless, the fear of being caught -- and the consequences of being 
caught, like fines,
confiscation, and jail terms -- must deter drug use to a certain extent?
<BR><B><P>MG</B>: Again, human psychology is more complex than a basic analysis of reward 
and punishment. There
is a large project, near completion, at the Rand Corporation, that is producing 
a lot of information and
analysis, including a cross-national analysis of drug policies and outcomes 
and a historical analysis of
pharmaceutical records from the period when cocaine was legal in the United 
States.
Many of these studies challenge the empirical basis for using deterrence as 
a means of controlling drug
use. For example, the Scandinavians imposed a severe penalty for having blood-alcohol 
levels above
.08 per cent, regardless of a driver's behavior or demeanor. There was a transitory 
drop in road fatalities
but then a return to baseline levels. This pattern is seen over and over again 
when severe penalties are
imposed.
In studies that zoom in on individual people's actual beliefs, we also find 
that the severity of penalties
plays little or no role in controlling whether or not people prone to using 
drugs actually use them. This
disregard for the law is truly remarkable since the cumulative risk of getting 
caught over an extended
career of drug use is fairly high.
<BR><B><P>NR</B>: So, you are saying that potential drug users are not all that sensitive 
to the threat of legal sanctions?
<BR><B><P>MG</B>: Yes. Dozens of studies say exactly that.
<BR><B><P>NR</B>: In that case, are there any other forces that control -- and could therefore 
be manipulated by society
to control -- the decision to use drugs.
<BR><B><P>MG</B>: There are several other forces at work here. One is the perceived health 
risk. If people believe that
drugs are physically harmful to them, they are more likely to resist taking 
drugs. Other forces, such as a
person's perception of the morality of the act, and perceptions of the morality 
of the law, also have an
effect, as do stigmatization from being caught, shame, and other dimensions 
of humiliation. There are
also informal social norms. Professor Robert MacCoun of UC Berkeley, whose 
study was part of the
Rand project, makes a strong case for the importance of these factors. However, 
on the other side of the
coin there is the forbidden-fruit effect, a process that may attract people 
to drug use. As I said, human
psychology is extremely complex.
<BR><B><P>NR</B>: You've considered drug use in terms of the individual user. Could you tell 
us a bit more about what
drug use looks like from society's perspective? For example, what does drug 
use ``cost'' society?
<BR><B><P>MG</B>: In terms of direct financial cost -- money spent on drugs that could have 
been spent more
productively -- according to the Office of National Drug Control Policy [ONDCP] 
approximately $41
billion was spent in 1990, down from $54 billion in 1988. However, those numbers 
are probably highballs.
<BR><B><P>NR</B>: Why is that?
<BR><B><P>MG</B>: Drug expenditures aren't tallied accurately like your hotel mini-bar charges. 
There's a lot of very
iffy guesswork. ONDCP tries its best by using two different methods. The ``consumption'' 
method
involves multiplying estimates of the number of drug users by estimates of 
the average amount of drugs
used. As you can imagine, neither can be measured very accurately. So they 
try to verify these estimates
by what they call the ``supply'' method, which estimates the amount of base 
crop raised in producer
countries, reduced by the amounts lost, the amounts seized or consumed in other 
countries, and the
amounts seized in our country. The remaining amount is then assessed for value 
by considering current
street prices. So the supply estimate is only as accurate as the six other 
estimates it is calculated from,
and as ONDCP acknowledges, there are even more uncertainties because much of 
drug value is bartered
for sex or for other drugs.
<BR><B><P>NR</B>: So it's possible that the drug market may not be as large as it is commonly 
represented?
<BR><B><P>MG</B>: Yes. It is likely, in fact. In 1992, Americans spent approximately $44 
billion on alcohol and $37
billion on tobacco. The number of Americans using these drugs is vast compared 
to those using illegal
drugs. Furthermore, alcohol and tobacco are not only available everywhere, 
but are actively promoted.
Taken together, it is hard to imagine that the illegal drug trade produces 
an income nearly equal to that of
alcohol or tobacco.
The overall pattern of data collected by government agencies is also at odds 
with other common
impressions. For example, how much of the drug business is centered on high-school 
and college
students?
<BR><B><P>NR</B>: Well, you're the one with the data. We'll guess at least half?
<BR><B><P>MG</B>: According to ONDCP, only $2 billion of the $41 billion spent in 1990 was 
spent by high-school and
college students. That is less than 5 per cent of the drug market, if their 
figures are correct. So, students
are not the primary drug consumers.
<BR><B><P>NR</B>: Even if we can't pin down an exact number, it is clear that a substantial 
amount of money is wasted
by drug users on purchasing drugs. On the flip side of the coin, how much of 
society's resources are being
utilized in the war on drugs?
<BR><B><P>MG</B>: The cost of the drug war is staggering at every level of government -- 
local, state, federal. For
example, federal grants to state and local drug-enforcement programs are now 
nearly a billion dollars a
year. Federal efforts on international drug control cost more than $800 million 
annually. Federal efforts
on drug interdiction are now at least $2.2 billion a year. The total federal 
drug control budget is in excess
of $12.5 billion a year, according to the 1992 Bureau of Justice Statistics 
Sourcebook. And these
numbers do not take into account the huge amount of money spent by state and 
local governments out of
their own tax sources.
<BR><B><P>NR</B>: What about non-financial costs? Certainly the criminal-justice system must 
be heavily burdened
by the war?
<BR><B><P>MG</B>: No question. In 1989, 1,247,000 people were arrested for drug-related offenses. 
Two-thirds of
those arrests were for possession only, and most of those were for marijuana. 
As for incarceration, in
1990 there were 930,000 inmates across America in federal, state, and local 
prisons. Of these, 50,000
were in federal institutions, and of these, half were in prison for drug offenses. 
Of the 684,000 prisoners
in state prisons, no less than 22 per cent were being held for drug offenses. 
The courts and jails and
prisons are just jammed with drug offenders.
<BR><B><P>NR</B>: We've eased toward the issue of legalization, and now we'll ask you straight 
out. Why not legalize
drugs?
<BR><B><P>MG</B>: Adversaries of drug legalization or decriminalization feel that relaxing 
drug laws will lead to
increased consumption. They submit that the increase in consumption in turn 
will produce an
unacceptable burden on society. This single point, for example, is the basis 
for James Q. Wilson's
anti-legalization position. However, there are several reasons to think this 
concern is misplaced.
Studies on the decriminalization of marijuana suggest that it leads to no significant 
increase in
consumption. Now, these studies have been contested because decriminalization 
occurred at a time
when overall drug use was declining for many other reasons. However, recent 
re-evaluations of
Prohibition data are consistent with the value of drug legalization.
Furthermore, current surveys indicate that among non-users, only 1.7 per cent 
thought that, if drugs
were legal, they would become users. Addicts did say they might use more. But 
controlled users thought
their own use would be unaffected.
These answers make sense, if you think about it. As I mentioned before, the 
legality of drug use is only
one among many factors that a person considers when deciding whether or not 
to use drugs. At least as
important are considerations such as risks to health, costs in terms of lifestyle, 
the morality of the act.
<BR><B><P>NR</B>: But wouldn't lots of people ``try it out'' if it were legalized?
<BR><B><P>MG</B>: It's possible that there would be a minor bulge in drug use immediately 
after legalization -- again,
the forbidden-fruit phenomenon. But think about it. Suppose heroin were legalized 
tomorrow and
available everywhere. Would you suddenly become an addict, or even a user? 
Probably not. Well, why
not? Because you would decide that the pleasure does not outweigh the risks.
As for current addicts, if they did use a little more, that would not necessarily 
increase their inability to
function, or further impair society's efforts to deal with them. Addicts already 
cause harm to themselves
and present a danger to others. But there is a limit to the amount of harm 
they can inflict on themselves
and to the degree of risk they can present to society. Is a bum on the street 
much worse off if he drinks four
bottles of Jack Daniels a day instead of only three? Is society much worse 
off?
<BR><B><P>NR</B>: Then the question, perhaps, is, Would there be more addicts if drugs were 
legalized?
<BR><B><P>MG</B>: If non-users are unlikely to begin using drugs, as we've discussed, new 
addicts would have to come
from the ranks of controlled users. As I said, controlled users believe their 
drug use would be unaffected
by legalization. Is this a credible belief? Absolutely. Because drugs are already 
widely available,
controlled users could use more right now if they wanted to. They choose not 
to use more because they
have determined how much they can take and still function. In other words, 
they regulate their own
behavior. And for that reason, they would be no more likely to become addicts 
post-legalization than
they are right now.
<BR><B><P>NR</B>: This may be a naive question, but are drugs really that widely available?
<BR><B><P>MG</B>: National Institutes of Health studies show that perceived availability 
has remained consistently
high for marijuana since 1975. As it has for cocaine. Furthermore, from 1988 
to 1992 drug availability,
by and large, increased -- despite the war on drugs. There was a 2.5-metric-ton 
increase in marijuana,
with a peak in 1989 - 90. Cocaine, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration 
as of 1993,
``remained readily available in virtually all major U.S. metropolitan areas.'' 
Heroin is available, and its
purity has increased. There are some regional variations in this pattern, but 
overall, drugs are
everywhere.
<BR><B><P>NR</B>: So legalization would not affect availability. However, the street price 
of drugs is artificially
inflated because drugs are contraband. If the price of drugs dropped precipitously 
-- as presumably it
would if they were legalized -- could this lead to increased consumption? Perhaps 
controlled users are
controlled partly by the high price of drugs.
<BR><B><P>MG</B>: Lower prices might mean increased use, but the data on this point are mixed, 
and there is some
indication that drug users are insensitive to price. That is, that they use 
similar amounts regardless of the
price of drugs. And again, consider alcohol. It is widely available and inexpensive, 
but not everyone is a
drunkard. In fact, attitudes have changed markedly as far as drunkenness is 
concerned. In the decades
after Prohibition was repealed, drinking hard liquor was a way of showing how 
sophisticated you were,
how you were more urbane than the rubes in the Women's Christian Temperance 
Union. Think of the
image of cocktail parties, of the Thin Man movies in which much of the humor 
revolved around getting
drunk, of Dean Martin's shtik. Nowadays public drinking of hard liquor to the 
point of slurring and
dizziness is just tacky. Square, corny old Johnny Carson had a running joke 
where he affectionately
teased Ed McMahon for his excessive drinking. Cool, hip Letterman and Leno 
wouldn't be caught dead
doing it. These pushes and pulls to alcohol use have nothing to do with jail 
or availability or price and
everything to do with social mores. There's no reason to think that the psychology 
of drug use is any
simpler.
<BR><B><P>NR</B>: So is the ``bulge'' you mentioned earlier something like the post-Prohibition 
bingeing you just
described?
<BR><B><P>MG</B>: Yes. But there is an important difference. Just after Prohibition was enacted, 
the drinking rate fell
off sharply. However, throughout the Twenties the drinking rate rose, despite 
Prohibition, and it was on
the rise when Prohibition was repealed. By contrast, drug use is down in every 
age group and across all
sectors of society, and it is continuing to fall. Just as an example, in 1973, 
37 per cent of 18- to
25-year-olds said they had used drugs in the previous month. In 1992, only 
13 per cent said they had.
<BR><B><P>NR</B>: That would seem to prove the point of the prohibitionists: it's the war 
on drugs that has caused drug
use to go down.
<BR><B><P>MG</B>: No. The drug war targets three specific factors that affect the drug-use 
rate, namely the availability
of drugs, the perceived risk of arrest or legal sanction, and the perceived 
risk to personal health. As far as
drug availability is concerned, the drug war has been a total failure. Drugs 
are as widely available now as
they ever have been. The risk of arrest has certainly increased -- since 1985 
drug arrests have gone up
from 718,000 to 1,247,000 a year. Remember, though, studies indicate that the 
perceived risk of arrest is
often ignored by drug users. Finally, health-education programs are widely 
promoting the belief that
drugs are bad for bodily and mental health.
So, the war on drugs may be having an effect. But it is important to understand 
that that effect is created
through several approaches. I don't know if the risk of arrest reduces drug 
use more than education does
-- or even if it reduces drug use at all. However -- and this is an important 
point -- if drugs were
legalized, health-education programs would continue to disseminate information. 
And they might then
have the resources that now go wastefully toward trying to decrease availability, 
and toward arresting
people. If we could have the same level of drug use through simple education 
programs, wouldn't we as a
society prefer that to incarcerating millions of our citizens?
<BR><B><P>NR</B>: Isn't there also a financial dimension? Education might be far less expensive 
than our current full
mobilization of the judicial system, would you agree?
<BR><B><P>MG</B>: I have seen only one attempt at estimating the potential costs and savings 
that would accrue to
society from legalization. In a recent book, Prohibition's Second Failure, 
Theodore R. Vallance, former
chief of the Planning Branch at the National Institutes of Mental Health, laid 
out a proposal based on his
experience and research. His main professional effort for many years was to 
come up with estimates and
plans concerning America's drug problem.
Vallance's analysis builds on several sources. First he used the 250-page report 
prepared for the NIH by
Dorothy Rice and her colleagues at the University of California. Dr. Rice compared 
the direct and
indirect costs of alcohol and drug abuse as well as of mental illness. Direct 
costs refer to actual program
expenditures such as those by health professionals, the police, the courts, 
and the prison system. Indirect
costs refer to such things as premature mortalities and morbidities due to 
substance abuse. These reflect
real losses in terms of productivity and participation in normal society. Not 
surprisingly, alcohol costs
society more than illegal drugs: in 1985, $70 billion versus $44 billion. For 
alcohol, most of the cost was
for treatment and estimated damage to personal health. For drugs, most of the 
cost was for law
enforcement and losses sustained by crime victims.
<BR><B><P>NR</B>: Could you break those numbers down a little?
<BR><B><P>MG</B>: Yes. Let me just review the drug-abuse numbers. Again in 1985, the year 
that was analyzed in such
detail, $13.5 billion was spent directly on the criminal-justice system -- 
police, legal adjudication, state
and federal corrections, local corrections, private legal defense, and so on. 
There was another $19 billion
in the indirect-costs category: around $1 billion for victims of crime, $4.4 
billion in loss of productivity
for those incarcerated, and $14 billion in loss of productivity for those in 
crime careers. Throw in around
$10 billion for the costs of treatment, and you have the 1985 estimate of $44 
billion. The figures for
direct costs are surely much higher today. For example, totally new moneys 
in the amount of $6 billion
were added by the Bush Administration for new task forces, prisons, interdiction 
programs, and many,
many other projects. A realistic current figure would be around $100 billion 
a year.
Vallance does not, however, simply summarize the past. He uses the Rice data, 
combines it with 1993
data on extra expenditures for enforcement, and comes up with the startling 
conclusion that legalizing
drugs could save society approximately $37 billion a year! In fact, I am sure 
his estimate is low, given the
documented increase in the direct costs already discussed. (See table.)
<BR><B><P>NR</B>: So the Vallance estimate is about $37 billion, and you say that it is probably 
low. How did he
estimate how much of the saving should be reinvested in treatment? And how 
do you measure other
dimensions of the problem like reduced suffering that might occur under a legalization 
scheme?
<BR><B><P>MG</B>: He was making best guesses based on his experience, which he writes about 
with great verve. For
years he had been pushing alternative plans within the government, only to 
be scolded by his superiors
for attempting to question other government agencies' capacity to deal with 
the drug problem. But he
emphasizes that the details could all vary a bit, but the overall pattern of 
the savings would remain the
same.
It is another matter to find a metric for human suffering. Surely a legalization 
scheme ought to find
people less fearful of criminal activity in their neighborhoods. Parents should 
feel better knowing the
police could concentrate on those criminal forces that would continue to peddle 
drugs to children.
Addicts ought to feel better knowing that society is dealing with their problem 
from a health point of
view, and surely there would have to be more programs to assist those who abuse 
drugs.
<BR><B><P>NR</B>: Thank you for your time, Professor Gazzaniga.

McNamara's Brand 
 <P>
Mr. Ferguson is a senior editor of The Weekly Standard. 
 <P>
 
I'M a little bit worried. As I write this, in early June, it's been a 
full month since I've read a nationally published article trashing 
Robert McNamara. All spring, immediately preceding the publication of 
McNamara's memoirs and then for a luscious period thereafter, you 
couldn't pick up a magazine or a reputable newspaper without exposing 
yourself to a shower of bile, all of it directed at our diminutive and 
bespectacled former secretary of defense. NR and The American 
Spectator pitched in, of course, but so did the New York Times and the 
Boston Globe, and Time and Newsweek, and The New Yorker and The New 
Republic -- even The Nation! For a while there, many of us McNamara-
despisers thought we'd died and gone to heaven (a fate, incidentally, 
that McNamara himself is unlikely to enjoy).
<P>
And then -- silence. What gives? Apparently the scribes have moved on; 
never has the press's short attention span been so criminally obvious. 
I feel like a guy at a college beer bust who senses the buzz just 
starting to kick in and wants to part-ay down, only to discover that 
everybody has gone off to the library to cram for a chem final. But 
for all that, I am an optimist; I am one of those who believe the keg 
is half full rather than half empty. And speaking only for myself, I'm 
ready for another draft.
<P>
My interest in McNamara is intensified because he exemplifies a 
peculiar Washington phenomenon. In Washington people fail up. The city 
is exempt from the laws of professional gravity. No other city is so 
accommodating of failure, so friendly to the people who fail. Large 
awards await the bunglers and bobblers, the has-beens and wannabees-
who-never-could. Our present mayor, to cite an obvious example, 
destroyed the city's finances, smoked crack on TV, went to prison -- 
and then got re-elected. Other failures have shown greater artfulness. 
You can see them cruising K Street in chauffeured Town Cars, cashing 
large checks for their "consulting" businesses, digging into filets at 
the Palm. Here's the Iran - Contra bungler, awarded a popular radio 
show for his work destroying the Reagan Administration. Over there is 
the manager of the 1992 Bush campaign, mulling offers from candidates 
to work his magic again in 1996. And over here is the chief strategist 
for Jimmy Carter during the Iranian hostage crisis -- why, he's the 
secretary of state!
<P>
McNamara is spiritual father to them all. He is the architect of a 
career breathtaking in the scope of its screw-ups, a clockwork 
progression of failure and reward, error and advancement. Imagine a 
friend who comes to visit. The first night he cooks you dinner and 
sets fire to the kitchen. The next morning he accidentally 
electrocutes the cat. He blows his nose in the curtains and never 
flushes the toilet. He borrows your car and drives through the garage 
door, then spreads a rare contagion to your kids. By the third day you 
make the decision: You ask him to move in with you.
<P>
This is the pattern of McNamara's career. At Ford Motors, in the late 
1950s, he designed the sclerotic top-down management system that 
almost sank the American automobile industry; for good measure, he 
oversaw the production of the Edsel. Accordingly, JFK handed him the 
Pentagon. There McNamara got the idea for the Vietnam War -- the Edsel 
of American foreign policy. So awed was the Washington establishment 
that it placed him at the head of the World Bank, in hopes that he 
might do for the international economy what he had done for the 
American military. And he did! Within ten years he had doubled the 
amount of money loaned, and lost, to Third World kleptocracies like 
Brazil and the Central African Empire. He was Midas in reverse. 
Wherever he draped his hand, industries wilted, economies collapsed, 
corpses piled up.
<P>
NO one should have been surprised, then, that when McNamara chose to 
write the story of his life, it should have turned out to be a 
disaster by every literary measure: mendacious, sentimental, shameless 
in its exculpation, oily in its tone, a book so badly written that no 
one would ever really want to buy it. And of course it has been a 
rousing bestseller. 
<P>
How does one explain a life thus charmed? His good looks? They may 
indeed have dazzled back in the days when no one minded goofy wire 
rims and the stink of Brylcreem. His sensitivity? It's true he cried 
often, and still does -- the one time I met him, at a think-tank 
luncheon, he teared up over the Cuban Missile Crisis -- and in the pre 
- Alan Alda Sixties a man's capacity to cry could still disarm unwary 
companions. But none of this is sufficient. Washington's inverted 
culture, where failure propels a man ever upward, bespeaks a kind of 
masochism. Of course, the actual  pain is dispersed to the country at 
large. But for the professional failure Washington remains safe 
harbor. Within weeks of the publication of the book, McNamara had been 
called "evil," a "liar," and a "hypocrite." Out in the heartland, a 
few Vietnam vets even sued him. Here in Washington Katharine Graham 
threw him a book party. Everybody who's anybody was there.

<BR>
<HR SIZE=3 WIDTH=50%>
10-July-1995 
 
<P>

<UL>

<LI> 
NR is delighted to announce the appointment of Kate Walsh O'Beirne as 
our Washington editor. Mrs. O'Beirne, who is vice president for 
government relations at the Heritage Foundation, first came to 
Washington as a staff assistant to the sainted junior senator from New 
York, James Buckley. In the Reagan Administration she served as deputy 
assistant secretary at HHS. She takes up her NR post on August 1. 
 <P>
<LI>A member of a state militia told a congressional committee the 
government is conspiring to change the weather. Is this the same 
government that can barely conspire to deliver the mail? 
 <P>
<LI>Welfare reform is getting typical Contract-with-America treatment in 
the Senate, i.e., GOP disarray followed by distressingly weakened 
legislation. Majority Leader Bob Dole and Finance Committee Chairman 
Bob Packwood both hoped to rush through a reform bill, Dole to win 
another feather for his presidential cap, Packwood to avoid a conflict 
with his end-of-June ethics hearings. But little had been done to 
ensure GOP unity, and now Senate Republicans are paying the price. The 
bill Packwood reported out of his committee -- weak on work 
requirements, silent on illegitimacy -- is unacceptable to 
conservatives like Lauch Faircloth (N.C.). And Packwood and Dole staff 
have rebuffed attempts to make the bill any more palatable to the 
Right -- even language merely declaring illegitimacy harmful to 
society was kept out of the bill. Faircloth and Phil Gramm were 
pointedly left off a task force formed to hammer out the welfare 
differences. This could herald a bloody intra-Republican battle -- 
with Phil Gramm carrying the conservative banner against the inside-
Washington maneuverings of, among others, prominent Dole staffers. Is 
the Dole campaign paying attention? 
<P> 
<LI>Beware the conciliatory Newt. At the outset of their New Hampshire 
shmooze-fest President Clinton and Speaker Gingrich shook hands on 
creating a bipartisan commission to recommend campaign finance and 
lobbying reforms. It was great feel-good theatrics, but awful policy. 
In the case of military-base closings, a bipartisan commission was 
just the trick, hammering out the unsavory details of a consensus 
goal. When it comes to campaign finance there's no consensus about 
anything, and the only meaningful role of a commission would be to 
create momentum for ill-conceived proposals, with public financing 
(a/k/a the politician's entitlement) topping the list. In case you 
doubt it: former Common Cause president Fred Wertheimer is gung-ho 
about the commission idea. Gingrich proved in New Hampshire that he 
knows moose when he sees them. If only we could say the same about 
bull. 
 <P>
<LI>Eagle-eyed Republican number-crunchers to the rescue! The President's 
budget is full of rosy assumptions, they say. Ten years down the road, 
it will still be $200 billion in the red when it is supposed to be 
balanced. You could almost hear the sigh of relief from the Democratic 
side of the aisle. 
<P> 
<LI>The House Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee recently heard 
five Federal Communications Commission officials explain why their 
bailiwick needed more funding at a time when other federal agencies 
are contemplating deep cuts. Why? The telecommunications legislation 
working its way through Congress creates so many new functions for the 
FCC that there's no way it can cope, given its current resources. The 
legislation crafted by the Senate Commerce Committee under Larry 
Pressler (S.D.) started out fairly deregulatory but got steadily less 
so under the pressure of fat-cat lobbyists and bipartisanship. By the 
time it hit the Senate floor, Bob Packwood (Ore.) and John McCain 
(Ariz.) -- the conscience of the Senate on telecom deregulation -- 
felt compelled to vote against it. The bill proposed in the House 
isn't much better. Subcommittee Chairman Jack Fields (Tex.) has been 
telling high-tech free-marketeers not to worry, reforms not made in 
the telecom bill can be taken care of in the course of re-authorizing 
the FCC. But the FCC bill Fields has just unveiled -- co-sponsored 
with liberal Democrat Ed Markey (Mass.) -- leaves FCC funding at 
current levels. Unless Newt Gingrich intervenes, the 104th Congress 
will blow an opportunity to unfetter a cutting-edge American industry 
by abolishing the FCC, privatizing the spectrum, and moving away from 
"universal service" requirements for phone service. What would the 
Tofflers say?n Gingrich will make his pitch to kids when he appears on 
an upcoming segment of MTV's Raw. Gingrich follows in the footsteps of 
Bill Clinton, whose performance on the rock 'n' roll network was a 
story second only to Michael Jackson's wedding. So, Mr. Speaker, 
boxers or briefs? 
<P> 
<LI>Ramon Cortines, the chancellor of the New York City School System, has 
resigned, and the liberal intelligentsia is in mourning. Felix Rohatyn 
called it "the saddest day in the twenty years I've been working with 
the city." But what were Cortines's achievements? Unlike his 
predecessor, Joseph Fernandez, he made some tentative but real cuts in 
an education bureaucracy larger than that of France. He reformed the 
practice of "social promotions" -- promoting sub-literate kids so they 
don't feel so bad about themselves. He gave parents the chance to take 
their children out of the program that would give them free condoms. 
But did Cortines gain from the powerful teachers' unions the right to 
dismiss incompetent teachers? Did he clean up the corrupt local school 
boards? Did he bring any discipline into a school system in which one 
teacher a day is hospitalized because of a student attack? Did he do 
anything to reduce the system's cost per pupil -- which remains 
several times that of demonstrably superior parochial schools in the 
city and of public schools in every other nation. Cortines is a decent 
man. The fact that his legacy was so meager shows how badly the 
schools need radical change. The first step toward that is to 
introduce real competition -- and not just in New York City. 
<P> 
<LI>In an annual rite of summer, New York City's "gay pride" parade will 
once again pass by St. Patrick's Cathedral, where militant homosexual 
activists will vent their hatred of the Catholic Church and its 
teaching of chastity for unmarried persons. Last year, while Rudy 
Giuliani turned a blind eye, gay exhibitionists pranced naked down the 
street and engaged in public masturbation. They chorused obscenities 
at the Cathedral, which while not illegal, as William Donohue of the 
Catholic League points out, would never be blessed by New York 
officials if it were done by Nazis in front of Temple Emanu-El, or 
Klansmen in Harlem. Mr. Giuliani has escaped political fallout so far, 
partly because Church officials have not put up much of a fight. Mr. 
Donohue, however, is another story. He has threatened to rouse the 43 
per cent of city residents who are Catholic, many of whom helped give 
the mayor his narrow victory over David Dinkins. If Mr. Giuliani 
wishes to show tolerance for gays, he should find a better way than 
tolerating bigotry against Catholics. 
<P> 
<LI>Will "even poor kids in distant areas," President Clinton asked Newt 
Gingrich, be able to cruise the Infobahn? Or "will the information 
superhighway simply give access on the Internet to [people] who tell 
you how to make bombs?" We hope not; we'd hate to see Ira Magaziner 
on-line. 
<P> 
<LI>The dramatic annihilation of Canada's pro-immigration Progressive 
Conservative Party in 1992, and its replacement in the national 
parliament by the new, immigration-questioning Reform Party, was a 
clear warning to U.S. political leaders. Now the general election in 
Ontario, Canada's largest province, on June 8 sends a warning about 
another elite-imposed policy: affirmative action, i.e., quotas. Before 
the three-week election campaign, the provincial Progressive 
Conservative leader, Mike Harris, had wisely positioned his party 
several hundred miles to the right of its late unlamented federal 
counterpart on tax and spending issues. But he still had only about a 
quarter of the vote, according to public-opinion polls. The provincial 
Liberals, with 52 per cent, appeared poised for a landslide win over 
the governing party, the socialist New Democrats. (Reform did not 
participate.) Then the New Democrats' quota policies exploded as an 
issue. Harris attacked them; the New Democrats denied they existed; 
the Liberals allowed as how they were against quotas but in favor of 
affirmative action blah blah blah. Result: Mike Harris is the new 
Progressive Conservative premier of Ontario. Typically, the Republican 
leadership in Washington was simultaneously passing the word that 
abolishing affirmative action will not, after all, be among its 
legislative priorities. 
<P> 
<LI>When Boris Yeltsin arrived in Halifax a reporter asked what it's like 
to come to a G-7 summit hoping to get a little attention. Yeltsin said 
he didn't know, but would ask Bill Clinton when he saw him. 
 
<P> 
<LI>Disney's new animated film Politicallycorrectahontas premiered in an 
extravaganza in New York's Central Park. The damage inflicted on the 
park's flora and fauna by the crowd of 70,000 certainly vindicates the 
film's message that Western Civilization has been harmful to the 
ecology of the New World. But the worst pollution was intellectual: 
Pocahontas is portrayed as a cross between Buffy Sainte-Marie, Joan of 
Arc, and Petra Kelly; the English settlers of colonial Virginia are 
brutal aristocrat/capitalist land-stealing predators. Powhatan, 
Pocahontas's father, is shown as the saintly leader of a people in 
true spiritual harmony with Nature; in reality he was a sort of Attila 
the Algonquin who conquered twenty rival tribes and annihilated some 
of them. All the facts of Pocahontas's story are so skewed that even 
her Native American descendants have complained that the film despoils 
their cultural heritage. Now we know what we were spared when Disney's 
project for an "American History Theme Park" in Virginia was 
torpedoed. 
<P> 
<LI>While hailing the encyclical Evangelium Vitae (The Gospel of Life), NR 
expressed concern on two points. The press had quoted Joseph Cardinal 
Ratzinger as saying that the encyclical's teaching on capital 
punishment represented a "development of doctrine," and that the new 
Catechism, issued only last year, would have to be revised to reflect 
the new teaching. Since then Fr. Richard John Neuhaus of First Things 
has asked the cardinal for a clarification, and has received this 
reassuring word. "Clearly, the Holy Father has not altered the 
doctrinal principles which pertain to this issue [the death penalty] 
as they are presented in the Catechism, but has simply deepened the 
application of such principles in the context of present-day 
historical circumstances. Thus, where other means for the self-defense 
of society are possible and adequate, the death penalty may be 
permitted to disappear. Such a development, occurring within society 
and leading to the forgoing of this type of punishment, is something 
good and ought to be hoped for." And there is no question of recalling 
the Catechism. The cardinal meant only that the official Latin text, 
which is being prepared after the publication of the vernacular 
versions, will refer to what Evangelium Vitae says about capital 
punishment. So Catholics relying on the Church's official teaching as 
expressed in the Catechism may in good faith disagree over whether, in 
today's circumstances, the self-defense of society requires the death 
penalty. Cardinal Ratzinger's clarification should be welcomed by all 
those who are concerned with the constancy of the Church's teaching. 
We expect it will not be welcomed by people who, ignoring what the 
encyclical says about abortion and euthanasia, triumphantly proclaimed 
that Evangelium Vitae condemns capital punishment. 
<P>  
<LI>"I am very much in favor of every American learning a second 
language," says Newt Gingrich. He adds, however, that every immigrant 
to America already has his second language and now needs to learn his 
first. After thirty years of multiculturalist foolishness, the 
government finally seems poised to make English the nation's only 
official tongue. Representative Peter King (R., N.Y.) has proposed a 
bill that would require election ballots and other federal documents 
to be in English, and would end bilingual education. To 
multiculturalism we do not bid adieu, hasta luego, sayonara, but good-
bye, farewell, so long forever. 
<P>  
<LI>The New Yorker now has a dress code. Staffers who deal with the public 
are told to wear Armani and Chanel suits. Tweedy stuff and Brooks 
Brothers are out. When the ukase came down, the staffers were told 
that "Tina" wants The New Yorker to be "a liberal, media-savvy kind of 
place." Oh. Get that oaf Thurber out of here. When New Yorker writers 
dressed like rubes and academics, they set the standard for national 
urbanity. Now they will dress up, and set the standard for mid-
Atlantic hype. 
<P>  
<LI>Recent visitors to the White House were offended by what they saw as 
"extreme and insulting" measures taken by Secret Service personnel 
against a minuscule safety risk. President Clinton has apologized for 
the Secret Service, and said the problem will be dealt with. As we go 
to press, however, the barricades on Pennsylvania Avenue have not been 
removed. 
<P>  
<LI>A study has determined that smoking reduces the risk of Parkinson's 
disease. Nyah, nyah.

</UL>
 
<H3>Lost Right?</H3>
 
IN Lost Rights James Bovard chronicled typical depredations of federal 
agencies. Each page represents an American who has faced a rigid, 
often unforgiving government, at a price in wealth or energy or 
freedom, or all three. Such encounters serve as a recruiting ground 
for the panoply of new-wave anti-government groups, from property-
rights activists to the county movement in the West to a growing 
National Rifle Association. It's no coincidence that as government has 
gotten bigger -- trying to do more for you by doing more to someone 
else -- so has the range and variety of its resisters.Along with the 
burgeoning government has come an expanded police power. Law 
enforcement no longer just means a cop walking the beat. It can mean 
someone from the Environmental Protection Agency checking to make sure 
you haven't built a new deck on supposed wetlands. It can mean someone 
from the Drug Enforcement Administration confiscating your house 
because a marijuana plant was found growing on the back forty. It can 
mean, as Charles Krauthammer recounted, an FBI agent asking you 
whether a former employee up for an Administration appointment ever 
cracked an ethnic joke. It can mean -- as we all know -- the Bureau of 
Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms barging into your house to investigate 
some suspected firearms irregularity. Hence, the increasingly uneasy 
relation between conservatives and law enforcement; it's difficult to 
support vigorous enforcement of laws that shouldn't be on the books in 
the first place. But there's a profound risk in seeming anti-law-
enforcement in an American polity that rightly cherishes law and 
order. The risk is all the greater in the wake of Oklahoma City, which 
has shone the spotlight on a right-wing fringe -- the militias -- that 
seems willing to reject the most basic governmental authority. How 
should conservatives respond? First, by sticking to their principles. 
Central government has always posed the gravest threat to liberty, and 
as Angelo Codevilla points out (page 35), liberals bent on tarring the 
entire case for limited government with Oklahoma City are engaged in a 
sinister enterprise. If their logic is taken seriously, they are 
arguing for the criminalization of a philosophical position, while at 
the same time seeking to increase the power of the central government 
to move against it. Even in small doses, this medicine promises only 
unhappy effects.The best way to ensure respect for law enforcement, 
conservatives should insist, is to ensure it for laws. And that won't 
happen until there are fewer of them. As government has grown, 
people's respect for it has dwindled. In fact, it has become an object 
of fear. But all of this fades in the public mind when it sees law-
enforcement agents confronting an armed band that has gunned down 
their colleagues. Whether the case involves David Koresh or Rodney 
King, officers who daily put their lives at risk should get the 
benefit of the doubt, regardless of the operational folly of their 
political bosses.For conservatives this means taking care about where 
to draw the line both in criticizing government and in making allies. 
Freshman Republican Steve Stockman clearly crossed it with his 
incendiary remarks about Waco and Janet Reno in Guns & Ammo. So did G. 
Gordon Liddy when he encouraged his listeners to expect federal agents 
to come busting down their doors. The NRA deserves the flak it has 
gotten for calling ATF agents jack-booted thugs. Finally, most 
militiamen might be weekend soldiers playing with guns, but others are 
paranoiacs who scramble their gun-toting friends at the first sighting 
of a U.S. military vehicle. These lapses on the Right should be 
criticized from the Right. So it was almost refreshing to hear 
Republican Peter King of New York (lifetime ACU rating: 87) say of the 
militias: "They're wackos, they're nuts, they're dangerous, and we 
should have nothing to do with them."The pull of these two imperatives 
-- to limit government but not to stand in the way of legitimate law 
enforcement -- is being felt in Congress now over the anti-terrorism 
bill. The measure has passed the Senate and will soon be considered in 
the House. In a strange-bedfellow alliance, some conservatives are 
joining the ACLU in worrying about the civil-liberty implications of 
the bill. On the strict merits, as Eugene Methvin points out (p. 32), 
these concerns are excessive. One measure that has gotten particular 
attention is the so-called roving wire-tap, which would peg a wire-tap 
to a person no matter what phones he uses. But there is no reason to 
believe this authority would diminish Fourth Amendment protections; it 
is the individual who has the privacy right, after all, not the 
telephones. Also raising concerns are provisions allowing the military 
to assist in domestic cases involving biological or chemical weapons. 
But the military involvement would be strictly limited to technical 
assistance and analogous to the limited role it now plays in the drug 
war. This sounds merely prudent in a world of technological 
terrorists, foreign and domestic. Indeed, former Attorney General 
William Barr -- hardly a liberal -- calls the legislation "balanced 
and reasonable."Still, given the expansive abuses that have occurred 
with well-meaning legislation like the RICO statutes -- originally 
meant to rein in mobsters, now brought to bear against targets as far-
flung as abortion protestors -- conservative suspicion is reasonable. 
Indeed, the current IRS audit of the NRA looks suspiciously similar. 
Hence, it's difficult to cede any more power to a Federal Government 
one can't be sure will act within its given bounds. The short answer 
is to give law-enforcement agencies the powers they need to protect 
society while keeping a careful watch on them and investigating abuses 
like Waco as soon as they come to light. If this sounds ambiguous, 
well, conservatives are doomed to ambiguity on these issues until 
government is returned to its proper place, and law enforcement again 
means foiling criminals rather than harassing citizens. 
 

 
<H3<Courting Trouble</H3>
 
SUPREME Court decisions in two affirmative-action cases mirrored the 
opinions of politicians of both parties. Judges and lawmakers know 
that something has spoiled in the refrigerator, but they can't bring 
themselves to clean it up.Adarand Constructors v. Pena was a case 
involving minority set-asides in federal transportation projects. One 
way or another, the Federal Government steers $14.4 billion a year -- 
8.3 per cent of federal procurement -- to DBEs, or disadvantaged 
business enterprises: firms owned by minorities or women. In Missouri 
v. Jenkins, the Court reviewed the public-school system of Kansas 
City, Mo., which might be called systemic affirmative action. For 
nearly a decade a federal district judge has commanded the state to 
spend $200 million a year on the schools of the inner city, to make 
them equal to the schools of the suburbs.In each case, four Justices -
- Stevens, Ginsburg, Breyer, and David He-Did-It-Again -- voted to 
maintain the status quo. Justices Scalia and Thomas wrote concurring 
majority opinions, calling for a clean slate. "There can be no such 
thing as either a creditor or debtor race," wrote Justice Scalia of 
Adarand Constructors. "As far as the Constitution is concerned," wrote 
Justice Thomas, "it is irrelevant whether a government's racial 
classifications are drawn by those who wish to oppress a race or by 
those who have a sincere desire to help those thought to be 
disadvantaged." On Missouri v. Jenkins, Thomas was even more scathing. 
Affirmative action in education means that "blacks, when left on their 
own, cannot achieve. To my way of thinking, that conclusion is the 
result of a jurisprudence based upon a theory of black 
inferiority."But the majority of the majority -- Chief Justice 
Rehnquist and Justices O'Connor and Kennedy -- would only urge the 
race-levelers to be more cautious. Racial "qualifications," wrote 
Justice O'Connor in Adarand Constructors, "are constitutional only if 
they are narrowly tailored measures that further compelling 
governmental interests." Chief Justice Rehnquist, in Missouri v. 
Jenkins, ruled that the rogue district judge was not applying "the 
appropriate test," to evaluate the success of his edicts, but 
Rehnquist's decision did not order his educational fiefdom to be 
dismantled. In other words, the majority held that reverse 
discrimination is a bad thing, unless it is done very carefully. It 
was the equivalent of installing yellow lights on a street that has 
been taken over by drag-racers.The judges were echoed by the pols. 
President Clinton has been trying to find a way of seeming to give the 
issue a second thought, without actually thinking about it. Newt 
Gingrich, meanwhile, signaled to Republican reformers, such as 
Representative Charles T. Canady (R., Fla.), that he was inclined to 
"hold hearings, but not necessarily to move quickly."Which means that 
the decision will be taken by the voters. California will have a 
referendum on affirmative action in 1996; other states will follow. It 
is only a matter of time before the congressional elections will in 
effect become referenda, to be decided by an increasingly fed-up 
majority. If the GOP doesn't enact the majority's sense of justice -- 
which is also the Constitution's -- the electorate will find other 
agents of its will. 
 

 
<H3>Republican Budgets</H3>
 
IN ADVANCING his new plan to balance the budget over the next ten 
years, President Clinton rejects the lessons of Liberal Budget Math 
101: the budget can be balanced only with a combination of tax 
increases and spending cuts, preferably in defense, and never in 
entitlements.Clinton's embrace of a zero deficit, tax cuts, and 
entitlement reforms marks a seismic shift in the political debate over 
federal budget policy. In November, the President was arguing that in 
electing a Republican Congress, voters were expressing frustration 
with the pace of liberal change. Now, though his new budget plan is 
largely phony, the rhetorical capitulation it represents acknowledges 
Republican success in setting the agenda -- perhaps for a generation. 
But it is also smart re-election politics for Bill Clinton. Abandoning 
Hill Democrats reflects the political reality of a plurality President 
seeking majority support in '96. Most surviving Hill Democrats enjoy 
what Bill Clinton lacks -- a safe liberal seat. As 1996 approaches, 
Clinton's political fortunes will improve in direct proportion to the 
distance he puts between himself and a hopelessly liberal Democratic 
caucus. He will position himself as fighting off the mean-spirited 
excesses of the Republican majority while rising above the special-
interest politics of liberal Democrats. This balancing act will be 
popular in the Senate, where there is no shortage of Republicans eager 
to stymie Newt. Come next year, Clinton will, in the time-honored 
manner, run for re-election against Washington, arguing that the 
public needs to be protected against the extremes of both parties on 
Capitol Hill. Before that happens, Republicans can advance their 
agenda by a judicious compromise -- on the question of who keeps score 
over the next few years. Under the President's budget estimates, 
Republicans could keep the full tax-cut package as passed by the House 
without sacrificing their goal of a zero deficit by 2002. In his ten-
year plan, the President uses the Office of Management and Budget's 
estimates of future growth. These are more optimistic than those of 
Congress's scorekeeper, the Congressional Budget Office, which leave 
the President with a $200-billion recurring deficit in 2005. Since the 
CBO is unwilling to recognize the growth effect of tax cuts, 
Republicans should adopt OMB's projections, thereby making tax cuts 
affordable -- even for Senator Domenici. 
 

 
<H3>Last Rites for the IRS</H3>
 
THERE is a revolution going on in Washington after all. Anyone who 
doubts this missed the three days of hearings before the House Ways 
and Means Committee on replacing the income tax. Chairman Bill Archer 
of Texas forcefully restated his commitment to "pull up the income tax 
by its very roots." The Left is apoplectic.One of Mr. Archer's star 
witnesses was William Dakin, tax counsel for Mobil Corporation. Mr. 
Dakin brought along a 76-pound, 4-foot high stack of papers -- Mobil's 
tax returns for 1993. Dakin told the stunned congressional panel: "It 
takes Mobil 57 man years at a cost of $10 million to prepare these 
income-tax returns." In a perverse way, our income-tax system has 
become one of Washington's most successful jobs programs. Historian 
Charles Adams, author of For Good and Evil: The Impact of Taxes on the 
Course of Civilization, told Congress of the events that led Britain 
to abolish an income tax in the early nineteenth century. According to 
Adams: "When the British legislature voted to defeat the income tax, 
there was the loudest exultation ever witnessed within the halls of 
Parliament. A motion then followed to have all the records of the tax 
destroyed." The tax records were burned by the citizenry in a giant 
bonfire. (Unfortunately, the Chancellor of the Exchequer "kept 
duplicate copies of the tax records in the basement of the Exchequer 
Court.")The debate in Washington is now not so much over whether to 
replace the income tax, as how. Republicans are falling into two 
camps: flat-tax proponents want to eliminate all deductions, abolish 
the capital-gains tax, scrap withholding, and put in place a flat tax 
of 17 to 20 per cent with a postcard form that could be completed in, 
say, 15 minutes. That's the moderate position. Mr. Archer wants to 
bulldoze the corporate, personal, and estate taxes entirely and move 
to a national sales tax. Of the thirty or so witnesses before his 
hearings, only one defended the current tax system -- the Clinton 
Administration witness, Les Samuels of the Treasury Department. Archer 
asked Samuels repeatedly: "Will the Administration come forward with a 
tax-reform plan, and if so, when?" Mr. Samuels's roundabout answer 
amounted to this: No, the White House likes the tax system just the 
way it is. Even the Democrats winced.Don't look for the Spirit of '76 
in the woods, it's in the House. 
 

 
<H3>The Bear at the Table</H3>
 
BORIS Yeltsin's appearance at Halifax was little more than a temper 
tantrum over Chechnya. It coincided with a bungled "rescue" by the 
supposedly elite Russian Alpha Group commando force at a hospital in 
southern Russia where Chechen guerrillas were holding two thousand 
hostages. After two days of the abortive "rescue mission," Yeltsin 
opted for negotiations with the Chechens over the hostages, as his G-7 
interlocutors had urged.The West has no direct strategic interest in 
Chechen independence. Our stake is indirect: Russia's performance in 
Chechnya is an indicator of its general disposition as a presumably 
reforming ex-imperialist power. What we have seen is a Russia that is 
once again flexing its muscles geopolitically (at least within the 
confines of the old USSR), flirting with authoritarianism, quick to 
resort to force, and not fastidious about methods. This has obvious 
implications for Russia's future behavior outside its old borders. The 
fact that the Russians were incompetent in Chechnya is somewhat 
reassuring. But no great power tolerates humiliation indefinitely. 
Already the Russian military is claiming -- and getting -- a larger 
share of the national budget. Five years from now, Russia's military 
posture may be no laughing matter.The good news is that Russia's 
desire to become a full member of the G-7 is now less likely than ever 
to be fulfilled. The G-7 is, after all, the special fraternity of the 
industrial democracies. Chechnya has dispelled most remaining 
illusions about the nature of the bear. The otherwise boring Halifax 
meeting may have been a useful field trip. 
 

 
<H3>The G-7 Bails Out</H3>
 
WHILE squabbling over Bosnia and trade policy, the world's richest 
nations managed to agree on one idea -- a global economic bailout 
fund. The fund, managed by the International Monetary Fund, would 
provide instant cash to countries facing Mexican-style currency 
meltdowns. Such aid would not be free of strings: countries that 
deliberately strayed from "acceptable" economic policies in order to 
receive funds would not be eligible. To its credit, the G-7 admits the 
moral hazards involved in offering an open-ended entitlement.Sharing 
this burden with other industrial nations is at least better than the 
sort of unilateral rescue effort rammed through by President Clinton 
for Mexico. The Halifax proposal requires that nations disclose a 
great deal of financial information they now keep secret or release 
much later. But, as NR's Ed Rubenstein points out, the economics of 
the scheme are still questionable. Consider the numbers. Currency 
trading has grown by more than 50 per cent over the past four years, 
to an estimated $1 trillion per day. At the same time, the total funds 
stockpiled by all central banks in the world to stabilize their 
currencies amount to just $1 trillion, or one day's worth of trading 
volume. So even if all of it were made available for emergency 
borrowing, the task would be quite impossible. In fact, the G-7 is 
willing to risk only a "mere" $50 billion for the new credit facility. 
The idea is to prevent a replay of the Mexican crisis. There is a 
widespread perception that the bailout orchestrated by President 
Clinton and the IMF is working well. It isn't. The peso collapse wiped 
out more than 40 per cent of Mexico's economic wealth. In 1994 
Mexico's GDP totaled about $350 billion; today it has shrunk to $240 
billion. Although interest rates range from 60 per cent to more than 
100 per cent, Mexican inflation will exceed 30 per cent this year. The 
peso remains worthless, and U.S. taxpayers will likely shell out far 
more than the $20 billion already pledged.Although stable currencies 
benefit developing economies, international aid is not the way to 
achieve them. The key lies in sound domestic monetary policy. Mexico 
erred in printing too many pesos during 1994, an election year. The 
central bank should have soaked up the excess pesos by selling off 
assets such as government bonds. The Federal Reserve does this every 
day. So do other central banks; there's no rocket science involved.The 
problem is that central bankers are often under the thumb of 
politicians. There's a way out, however. Simply convert the central 
bank into a currency board such as those that now exist in Hong Kong 
and Argentina. Under a currency board, all currency growth has to be 
exactly matched by an expansion in foreign-exchange reserves, 
guaranteeing that the currency is fully convertible. Argentina endured 
inflation of 2,300 per cent in 1990, the year before it established 
its currency board. Today Argentina's inflation rate is under 4 per 
cent.Currency boards lack the glamor and excitement of bailouts. But 
make no mistake about it, bailouts are never what they seem to be. 
Messrs. Clinton and Rubin claimed to have the Mexican people on their 
minds, but the real winners were the American banks, mutual funds, and 
pension funds that held the debt and securities the bailout saved. The 
American taxpayer came in a distant last. That's where he'll come in 
under a global bailout fund. 

 
 
<H3>Lost in the Woods</H3>
 
THE nation had something to cheer about when Air Force Captain Scott 
O'Grady, whose F-16 was shot out of the sky over Bosnia on June 2, was 
rescued six days later by a daring helicopter raid by U.S. Marines. 
The heroism of all concerned was genuine. Less admirable was President 
Clinton's blatant exploitation of Captain O'Grady's rescue to salvage 
public support for the bankrupt policy that had put the captain in 
harm's way in the first place.The cause of the shootdown was not just 
an intelligence failure or a failure to communicate timely 
intelligence to the pilot. It was a political failure, at the highest 
level.It has been known since November that the Bosnian Serbs had 
acquired anti-aircraft missiles like the high-speed mobile SA-6 that 
hit O'Grady. The missile threat, indeed, had caused NATO to cancel air 
drops of humanitarian relief supplies late last year. Since that time, 
the U.S. Air Force has been arguing to the Joint Chiefs of Staff that 
NATO ought to eliminate the missiles as a threat to its "peacekeeping" 
operations. In northern Iraq, for example, U.S. air patrols like 
O'Grady's are accompanied by a robust capability for suppressing 
hostile air defenses by electronic jamming and radar-destroying 
counter-missiles. In Bosnia, however, at UN insistence, the Air 
Force's requests were repeatedly denied by higher authority, for 
political reasons, as an unacceptable "escalation." Until now, that 
is. The rules of engagement have been changed in the wake of the 
O'Grady drama.The captain won cheers with his tale of resourcefulness 
and his forthright declaration of religious faith. Given all the self-
defeating restraints that remain in the Western powers' Bosnia policy, 
nothing short of divine intervention will avert future losses of 
American or British or French lives. Captain O'Grady, once lost in the 
woods, has been rescued. The same cannot be said of his Commander-in-
Chief. 
 

 
<H3>John Finley, RIP</H3>
 
JOHN H. Finley Jr., a relic and type of Harvard's ancestors past, died 
last week. Scholar, classicist, and Master of Eliot House from 1941 to 
1968, Finley brought Harvard's house system to its pinnacle by 
investing Herculean effort into selecting each freshman who applied to 
live there. Master Finley defined the principles of a Harvard 
education in his 1946 "General Education in a Free Society." He 
expected the best from his students, and so they delivered it (a 
lesson in an age where grade inflation and personal-esteem enhancement 
predominate). A generation of men were molded by Finley and the 
college that he loved. Atque in perpetuum, frater, ave atque vale.

(RINGING)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE VOICE: Good morning, American Broadcasting 
Company.
VPOTUS: Robert Iger, please.
UFM: Certainly. 
(CLICKS. UNIDENTIFIED MUSICAL SELECTION.)
UFM #2: Robert Iger's office.
VPOTUS: Is Mr. Iger in?
UFM #2: Whom shall I say is calling?
VPOTUS: Al Gore.
UFM #2: And you're with . . . ?
VPOTUS: Um . . . the executive branch.
UFM #2: Of . . . ?
VPOTUS: The federal government.
UFM #2: Please hold the line.
(CLICKS. UNIDENTIFIED MUSICAL SELECTION.)
(ELAPSED TIME: 11 MINUTES, 23 SECONDS)
UFM #2: Go ahead, Mr. Iger.
ROBERT IGER, CEO -- ABC TELEVISION NETWORK: Newt?
VPOTUS: No, it's Al Gore.
RI: Al Gore? Al Gore? Oh! THAT Al Gore! Well, Mr. Vice President, this 
is indeed an honor. Hey, if you're calling about the nudity and 
violence on NYPD Blue you're too late -- Bob Dole already called! Ha 
ha! I'm kidding, of course. We here at the American Broadcasting 
Company -- and by extension our corporate parents at Capital Cities -- 
hold the nation's airwaves as a kind of a sacred trust. There's 
nothing more dear to use than the VHF band, as a viewing of, say, 
Family Matters or America's Goofiest Cops will attest to. And how may 
I help you, sir? 
VPOTUS: Well, I'm calling at the behest of the president. We're 
requesting thirty minutes of network airtime to present our budget 
plan.
RI: How many minutes?
VPOTUS: Thirty.
RI: Ouch. Mr. Veep, you're killing me! Thirty minutes which day?
VPOTUS: Tuesday.
RI: Tuesday? As in Roseanne? As in 33 share? 
VPOTUS: Wednesday, then?
RI: Oooh. Double ouch. Ellen. Grace Under Fire. 37 share. C'mon. Work 
with me, here. You know what I'm thinking? I'm thinking Thursday.
VPOTUS: Well, we tried that. NBC refused. 
RI: They did? Where's their sense of civic duty?
VPOTUS: Apparently, Seinfeld and Friends are pretty popular.
RI: I know, but by God! We're all Americans, after all. Hmmmm. I'm 
thinking here. I'm thinking here. 
VPOTUS: You know, in the past, it's been traditional for the networks 
to grant time to the president as a matter of course, without 
hesitation.
RI: Yeah, and with all due respect: A), in the past, the networks 
haven't had any competition; and 2) let's be totally honest, you're 
asking for thirty minutes now, but I remember a time when you folks 
down there told me to my face that the State of the Union wouldn't go 
past forty-five minutes, and I'm watching the thing go to an hour, 
then an hour and a half, eating up all of prime time on the east 
coast, taking a big chunk out of the west, and you guys are saying to 
me ``he's wrapping up, he's wrapping up,'' but hell, I KNOW when a 
guy's wrapping up and he wasn't even close -- and that's dollars down 
the drain, and don't quote me on this, but you didn't get the health 
care thing anyway, did you? 
VPOTUS: I hate to bring up the FCC here, but -- 
RI: Can I offer you a piece of advice? In my business, when a show 
isn't going as well as it should, or it's getting overlooked, or it 
needs re-tooling, we put it on something called ``hiatus.'' You guys 
should look into that option.
VPOTUS: You want us to put the executive branch of the federal 
government of the Unites States of America on ``hiatus?''
RI: Um . . . .yeah. Why? Is that bad?
VPOTUS: You know, CBS gave us the time with no argument.
RI: Of course they did! They're in fourth place! Their ratings are in 
the toilet! You offered them thirty minutes of free programming. What 
are they going to say? No? C'mon! They've got Murder, She Wrote, which 
skews way, way, way old, one of those really bad Linda Bloodworth-
Thomason shows -- hey, no offense -- and you! If I were them I'd offer 
you guys a whole series!
VPOTUS: This is unbelievable.
RI: Hey, if your guy just skewed a little younger. Not boomer, really, 
but younger. Somewhere between boomer and Gen-X. I can sell time for 
thirty minutes of that. 
VPOTUS: Sell time?
RI: Yeah, you know. Commercials? Pay the rent?
VPOTUS: The President of the United States doesn't ``break for a 
commercial.''
RI: Yeah yeah yeah. When he needs votes, he'll play the sax and talk 
about his underwear on MTV, but then suddenly it's all ``Mr. 
President'' this and ``Dignity of the Office'' that. I got news for 
you: you can't unscramble an egg, you know?
VPOTUS: Look, CBS and CNN and NBC said that they would give us the 
time. 
RI: Okay, okay. You twisted my arm. You win, okay! You win! We'll give 
you the time.
VPOTUS: Commercial free?
RI: You're killing me, here! Killing me! But, okay, commercial free.
VPOTUS: Thanks, Mr. Iger. Bill and I really appreciate it.
RI: Now there's something that you can do for me.
VPOTUS: What's that?
RI: You wanted thirty minutes, right?
VPOTUS: Right?
RI: Can you get it down to five? I've got a Circus of the Daytime 
Drama Stars special I just can't move.
VPOTUS: I'll see what I can do.

<H3>Saving Gramm's Campaign</H3>

RICHARD BROOKHISER<P>

<I>Mr. Brookhiser is an NR senior editor.</I><P>
<BR>
NEW YORK<P>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE ="+2>P</FONT>HIL Gramm's film career bloomed and faded in Texas, 
and its dried petals were exhibited by The New
Republic in Washington, D.C., but the story found its home in Gotham. A PORN-AGAIN 
PREZ
HOPEFUL, shouted the Daily News. PORNO-GRAMM, squawked the Post. All that was 
missing was
TOPLESS BODIES FILMED BY BRAINLESS GRAMM.
<P>
The hinterlands made less of the tale. ``Not many people down here are interested 
in what The New
Republic has to say about Phil Gramm,'' said Bill Murchison of the Dallas Morning 
News.
Representative J. D. Hayworth (R., Ariz.), a strong Gramm supporter in the 
class of '94, compared the
impact of the flap in his district to a ``whoopee cushion -- it made a lot 
of noise, but the wind went out of
it quickly.'' In a few days, even the national-media pinball machine was flipping 
other news-bits.
<P>
The Gramm story shows yet again that while dirt is fun, presidential elections 
are serious affairs. The
weaknesses of the Gramm campaign are structural and intellectual. There is 
a limit to what he can do to
remedy them, but he can do quite a lot.
<P>
Phil Gramm came into 1995 trailing clouds of glory from last year's health- 
care wars. He raised more
money in one night in Dallas than most candidates see in a lifetime. He wins 
straw polls with dull
regularity. But the mountainous effort has so far produced mousey results in 
the polls. In a Zogby - New
York Post poll in late April, Gramm trailed Bob Dole by 47 points, and Pat 
Buchanan by 7.
<P>
Gramm's slow start is the result of difficulties with three Republican grouplets. 
The smallest, and
peskiest, is the guardians of New Hampshire's divine right to the first primary. 
Gramm encouraged
efforts by Arizona and Louisiana to jump to the head of the queue, and he attended 
a May convention in
Delaware despite stern warnings from New Hampshire Republicans that it was 
anathema. So, although
Gramm can show a New Hampshire senator in his corner (Bob Smith), the Manchester 
Union Leader has
sniped at him, and Stephen Merrill, the conservative governor, sits on the 
fence.
<P>
Gramm's night at the movies came in the midst of a push to shore up his standing 
with social
conservatives and the religious Right. Abortion was a symbol of his difficulties. 
Gramm has a pro-life
voting record, but he was reluctant to stress the issue in his campaign. ``Short 
of a moral reawakening in
the land, we are not going to have anything like unanimity'' on the issue, 
he had told the Washington
Times in 1993. ``I'm pro-life. I can't reach another conclusion in my heart,'' 
he told Human Events early
this March, but added that under Reagan the GOP ``attracted people who had 
many different views on
issues like abortion.'' When Gary Bauer of the Family Research Council complained 
that the ``in my
heart'' talk reminded him of the evasions of Mario Cuomo, Gramm met with him 
and James Dobson of
Focus on the Family. The meeting was frosty. ``At first there was a little 
filibuster'' from Gramm, Bauer
recalls. ``Then things went downhill.'' ``I'm not a preacher,'' Gramm told 
Dobson. ``That's your job.''
<P>
Early in May, Gramm went to Jerry Falwell's Liberty University to give the 
commencement address and
mend fences. He said that America was in the midst of an economic and a moral 
crisis, both having
``their roots in the explosion of a government'' that ``squanders the fruits 
of our labor'' and ``corrupt[s]
our values.'' The blue-movie episode that followed soon after was what they 
call ``off message,'' but
Bauer believes that it caused as little a stir as it did among social conservatives 
because Gramm had
already been out there, trying to address them.
<P>
Gramm's third problem is with a tendency rather than an organized lobby: the 
supply-side faith left over
from the Eighties. ``If we want to let people keep more of what they earn, 
we've got to not spend it,''
Gramm says. With a Republican Congress, that is now a possibility for the first 
time in decades. Would a
Republican President keep hammering the anti-tax, pro-growth message? Fear 
that neither Gramm nor
any of his current opponents would briefly encouraged supply-side publisher 
Malcolm Forbes Jr. to flirt
with running himself -- the most quixotic venture in a year that has produced 
Arlen Specter and Alan
Keyes. Forbes stayed on the sidelines, but supply-side doubts about the GOP 
field, including Gramm,
linger.
<P>
Gramm's strength is also his problem: he has a philosophy. ``He has been rock-solidly 
consistent,'' says
Jim Miller, former Reagan budget director, who went to college with Gramm at 
the University of
Georgia and taught economics with him at Texas A&M. ``When he first got into 
politics and started
calling up chambers of commerce, he gave a speech he called his 'government 
is the enemy' speech.''
He's been giving it ever since he arrived in Washington as a congressman in 
1979. You disarm the enemy
by cutting programs and cutting funding. Along the way, Gramm has made his 
share of compromises for
Texas pork -- the mohair program, the supercollider -- and in Bush-era debacles 
such as the 1990
budget deal and the 1991 Civil Rights Act. But this is where his music comes 
from. He is not going to
change it because some Beltway operatives ask him to. He is not going to change 
it because someone
shows him a better way. No one will, because Gramm's way is right. Gramm's 
knobbly personal
qualities -- abrasiveness, lecturing would-be advisors -- are not ``merely'' 
personal. They grow out of
his convictions and the pride with which, as a self-made academic, he holds 
them.
<P>
Social conservatives are looking for a soulmate. ``Something's wrong with the 
core of the country,'' says
Bauer, ``and it's not just the size of government. The size of government didn't 
make Mrs. Smith put her
kids in the lake. There is a coarseness, a depravity, a decay.'' Bauer's people 
want a leader who connects
with ``what they see in the headlines.'' Gramm won't be that leader. But he 
can show that he and they
have the same enemy in the explosion of government. Professor Gramm may think 
the connection is
obvious, but nothing is too obvious to be said one thousand times, especially 
in a presidential campaign.
<P>
Some staffers attuned to these things might help. Gramm has been dealing with 
the Bauers and the
Dobsons himself in part because he doesn't seem to have anyone around him who 
knows them.
(Compare Bob Dole, whose deputy political director is Judy Haynes, former deputy 
executive director
of the Christian Coalition.) New staff would offset some of the staff Gramm 
already has. Linda Dival, his
pro-choice pollster, will be reading the numbers through a socially liberal 
prism. She will also rub the
religious Right the wrong way every time she shows up on the box to spin for 
her man. Gramm needs
help fending off Buchanan. The Gramm campaign would prefer to ignore him, focusing 
on a battle of the
titans with Dole. But Gramm has temporarily lost titan status: his enemy of 
the moment is the man who
edged him in the Zogby poll. The shots are there to be taken -- on the Gulf 
War, on trade -- but Gramm
must understand that he needs to take them. In the meantime, the Liberty speech 
was a step in the right
direction.
<P>
Opposing Dr. Henry Foster for surgeon general will be another, if Gramm criticizes 
Foster on
philosophical grounds, namely that Foster is a bad nominee because of his record 
as a sex educator and a
supporter and provider of abortions, not because he told fibs about that record.
The supply-siders will have to grin and bear it. Phil Gramm is not Ronald Reagan. 
Gramm will not
promise morning in America. He wants high noon in Washington.

<H2>THE MISANTHROPE'S CORNER</H2>

<H3>Honey, I Shrunk the Attention Span</H3>
<P>

St. Martin's has just published The Florence King Reader, an anthology.
<P>

<FONT SIZE = "+2">T</FONT>HE American attention span always has gotten a lot 
of attention. The
first to note our easy distractibility was Alexis de Tocqueville. His findings 
were echoed by Frederick
Jackson Turner, but being an American, Turner used the more tactful and romantic 
``restlessness.''
Other commentators were people with a stake in concentration, such as teachers, 
inventors, bridge
players, and Jobean old salts who made boats-in-bottles. These earlier critics, 
who tended to use words
like ``stick-to-itiveness,'' held that Americans could not concentrate because 
we could not sit still. This
opinion prevailed until the television age, when a new kind of critic announced 
that sitting still was
destroying our ability to concentrate.
<P>
Sociologists of the Fifties warned that TV viewers were falling into the habit 
of thinking in clumps of ten
or fifteen minutes, until a commercial came on and temporarily shut down the 
cognitive process.
Actually this was the Golden Age of the American attention span. Early TV had 
some meaty shows such
as Hallmark Hall of Fame and Playhouse 90 that were presented live within the 
traditional boundaries of
the drama, so the resultant thought-clumping was not very different from what 
playwrights had been
doing for thousands of years.
<P>
The logic-friendly format of the theatrical act went out of style around the 
same time that more artistry
went into commercials. Our attention span consequently shrank to about five 
minutes, according to the
sociologists. It went on like this, with a new official attention span announced 
every few years, until it
was down to thirty seconds. It stayed at that for a while, long enough to begin 
acquiring the cachet that
attaches to permanence, but then the soundbite came along and turned thirty 
seconds into an eon.
<P>
No one has announced our new attention span yet, but there are hints. Bill 
Clinton promised to ``focus
like a laser beam'' on the economy. A current bumper sticker, ``Practice Random, 
Senseless Acts of
Kindness,'' effectively says that if you help more than one old lady across 
the street, instead of leaving
the second one standing there while you rush off to hug the squeegee man, you 
are in a rut. Computers are
getting faster and faster, with each new speed advertised as ``blazing,'' and 
Internet messages of ``snail
f---!'' greet those who still use a 386.
<P>
Movies are becoming increasingly incoherent as scriptwriters strive for new 
ways to keep the restless
interested. Gone is the orderly approach that Old Hollywood called ``backstory'' 
-- filling us in on the
action up to the point where the movie begins. It's a technique as old as storytelling. 
Hamlet: the king has
died; Rebecca: the first wife has died; The Odyssey: the hero is setting off 
for home after a long absence.
This is all we need to know to follow the plot, but we need to know it right 
away.
<P>
Apparently feeling that logical narration is for snail fanciers, today's movie 
makers eschew both
backstory and the traditional flashback in favor of the staccato technique 
known as ``cutting in and out.''
<P>
The movie opens with a scene of bankers in conference. We barely know who everyone 
is, when
suddenly the dreary discussion of loans is interrupted by a split-second shot 
of a naked smooth leg
draped over a naked hairy leg. This means that an affair was had, but we have 
as yet no idea who had it.
Back to the bankers for a few minutes, then another split-second shot of a 
knife on a kitchen counter.
When the bankers adjourn for lunch we see the entwined legs again. This time 
the hairy leg fades out and
immediately fades in again, covered now in prison orange. The orange-leg shot 
is mixed with a shot of a
boys' baseball team in orange socks; back and forth, faster and faster, man's 
leg, boy's leg, bad orange,
good orange, while the soundtrack emits whirring, clicking noises to suggest 
someone snapping still
photos as fast as humanly possible.
<P>
Never mind the popcorn, the best accompaniment for today's movies is a surge 
protector. Other
cinematic devices designed to nail our elusive attention are the split-screen 
telephone conversation and
the zoom shot that pulls a human dot on the horizon into an extreme close-up 
so fast that our stomachs
turn over. But of all the techniques for concentrating the mind, the most ironic 
is the freeze frame. A
character who stops dead in his tracks and assumes a basilisk stare is probably 
supposed to remind the
audience to focus like a laser beam, but in fact it resembles nothing so much 
as that menopausal dilemma
of standing motionless in the middle of a room, trying to remember what it 
was you came in to get.
<P>
<FONT SIZE = "+2">M</FONT>UCH of our flagging attention is a natural reaction 
against the unnecessary tedium we create for
ourselves. As the country that enshrined the clarion call of ``quick 'n' easy'' 
and still believes ads
promising mastery of a foreign language in only ``ten minutes a day,'' wouldn't 
it make sense for us to be
on the parliamentary system? We could have got rid of Bill Clinton long ago, 
but no, we wait out the
whole grinding, nerdy, petulant four years, and then wonder why we can't keep 
our minds on anything.
<P>
Our distractibility is also the inevitable residue of our undisciplined feelings. 
The American proclivity
for leaving our emotional lights on has drained the battery of our attention 
span dry. The human spirit can
take only so much of 24-hour coverage, memorial services, ribbons, teddy bears, 
crisis counseling, and
moments of silence. We pay such obsessive attention to disasters and tragedies 
that we end up seeking
respite in forgetfulness. (Quick, name one Teheran hostage.)
<P>
Welcome to America the Flea Circus. We now have a new disease, Attention Deficit 
Disorder, and like
all democratic diseases, it does not discriminate. The good news is that by 
the time we run the gauntlet of
ADD resources, clinics, programs, workshops, seminars, CBS Specials, and Sally 
Struthers promos, no
one will remember what it is. J

<H2>THE WEEK</H2>
<P>

President Clinton is reported to be contemplating a notion to develop an initiative 
to consider the
possibility of formulating an intention to assemble a framework which could, 
under certain
circumstances, be used to develop the foundation for a possible plan to devise 
a tentative policy on
Bosnia.
<P>

You don't have to be a weatherman to tell which way the wind is blowing -- 
you just need to look at Pete
Wilson. The California governor's executive order ending racial preferences 
not mandated by state or
federal law is reassuring: if Pete Wilson is out in front on affirmative action, 
there's no place safer to be.
Representative Charles Canady (R., Fla.) will soon join him there when he introduces 
his ``Civil Rights
Act of 1995,'' a measure (inspired by the California Civil Rights Initiative) 
that would wipe out
preferences at the federal level. Bob Dole will likely be close behind with 
his own version in the Senate.
It bears repeating that, in taking on affirmative action, jittery Republicans 
only have to cut through a thin
layer of media and establishment flak before meeting the broad sense of fairness 
of the American
people. Fortune, in this case, is forgiving; she doesn't favor the brave so 
much as those, like Wilson, with
elementary political smarts.
<P>

After watching House Republicans march with the precision of an honor guard 
through the first hundred
days, new-generation senators have rebelled at the stumbling on their side 
of the Capitol -- Mark
Hatfield's dissent on the Balanced Budget Amendment being the foremost example. 
So Connie Mack
(Fla.) has proposed a serious overhaul of the Senate Republican Conference. 
After each election Senate
Republicans would get together to set a policy agenda for the next Congress, 
a mini Contract with
America. Then, before electing their committee chairmen, senators could find 
out if a would-be
chairman disagreed with any of the items of this common-denominator, got-to-have-it 
agenda. If so,
would-bes might become also-rans. Moderates are screaming that this reform 
assails the ``diversity'' of
the party. But Mark Hatfield and his Old Guard soulmates would provide the 
same ``diversity'' as
ranking majority members of their committees that they now do as chairmen. 
They just wouldn't give as
much aid and comfort to the Democrats.
<P>

Telecommunications is the most thoroughly regulated industry in America, and 
it just might stay that
way. The telecommunications bill crafted by Senate Commerce Committee Chairman 
Larry Pressler
(R., S.D.) contains some ninety new rule-making functions for the Federal Communications
Commission, retains elements of the disastrous Cable Act of 1992, and raises 
the specter of new
telecommunications entitlements by possibly extending ``universal service'' 
requirements (which now
apply to phone service) to new technologies. Pressler has apparently been rolled 
by Senator Ernest
Hollings (D., S.C.), who has pulled the Senate bill ever closer to the two-hundred-page 
regulatory
monster he proposed last year. The House telecom bill is better, but it still 
suffers from timidity and the
close relationship of Representative Jack Fields (R., Tex.), chairman of the 
relevant subcommittee, to
liberal Democrat Edward Markey (Mass.). Bolder stuff comes by way of a new 
report from the Progress
and Freedom Foundation which calls for abolishing the FCC, slicing away huge 
swaths of regulation,
and privatizing the electromagnetic spectrum. It's time the Third Wave met 
the free market -- and
Republican committee chairmen met both.
<P>

Everywhere he goes, he says, people ask Colin Powell what he believes. We can 
tell you exactly what he
believes: that, ``You're not going to hear it today.''
<P>

Aliens who are convicted of felonies after coming to America are ``deportable'' 
under the Immigration
and Nationality Act. They are rarely deported, however, because they are able 
to seek endless judicial
review of the order of deportation. According to a 1995 Senate Report on Criminal 
Aliens in the United
States, a conservative estimate of the total number of deportable aliens in 
the country is 450,000. The
Immigration and Naturalization Service cannot house this many, so most of them 
are released onto the
streets, with instructions to report several months later for an INS hearing. 
Needless to say, most of them
miss their hearings. They do not vanish for good, however. A recent study by 
the General Accounting
Office found that 77 per cent of non-citizens convicted of felonies are arrested 
at least one more time. In
Los Angeles County alone, more than half of incarcerated illegal aliens are 
re-arrested within one year
of their release. Under provisions of the Senate Republican anti-terrorism 
bill sponsored by Spencer
Abraham (Mich.), aliens would still have all the due-process protections afforded 
American citizens on
the underlying offense. There would still be a hearing before an immigration 
judge, which could still be
appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals. All the Abraham provisions remove 
is the much-abused
process of judicial review of the order of deportation. But this is too much 
for Senator Edward Kennedy,
who has offered amendments to keep the status quo. If he succeeds, alien felons 
will continue to be
deported at the current pace -- about 4 per cent a year. Assuming no alien 
is ever convicted of another
felony, it would take 23 years to deport the current backlog. The first step 
to controlling our borders is
controlling Senator Kennedy.

<head><title>LETTER FROM AL -- NR</title></head><body>
<H2><I>LETTER FROM AL</I></H2>June 5, 1995
<P>Dear Rusty:
<P>

It's been pretty crazy around the Gore household these days -- the kids are 
out of school, Newt Gingrich
is dismantling the Clean Water Act, the rain gutters need to be cleaned out 
. . . it's a busy time.
<P>
Sarah and Kristin are actively seeking summer jobs. You were kind to offer 
to have them spend the
summer with you down on the Orinoco, classifying carrier ants, but after a 
long discussion, Tipper and I
decided that it would be best if they both spent the summer closer to home. 

<P>
The problem is that Little Al wants a summer job too -- he's bored mowing the 
lawn and selling
lemonade to his Secret Service detail -- but he's too young for most jobs. 
The girls couldn't be less
helpful. At every turn, they've accused Little Al of being part of the ``oppressive 
male patriarchy'' that
has kept women out of all of the ``really cool summer jobs.''
<P>
I'm starting to wonder about the National Cathedral School, Rusty. At dinner 
tonight, when I told the
girls that they couldn't spend the summer with you in Brazil, Kristin responded 
by going limp in protest
(splashing sorrel soup on Tipper's grandmother's tablecloth) and Sarah began 
scribbling furious notes in
her diary (which she has entitled: ``Sarah: A Slave Narrative''). Tipper reprimanded 
Kristin, who replied
that hand-rolled linen symbolizes an oppressive society that ``infantilizes 
women.'' And when Little Al
told Sarah that it's rude to write at the table, she shouted ``You will not 
censor me!'' and dashed out of the
room. 
<P>
I cleared the plates, made a pot of chamomile tea, and settled down to write 
you a letter. I had barely
finished writing ``Dear Rusty'' when the phone rang. An emergency National 
Security meeting at the
White House. Subject: Bosnia. 
<P>
When I arrived, the Situation Room was crowded: Bill, Tony Lake, ``Chris'' 
Christopher, Strobe Talbott,
and General Shalikashvili were missing, but Paul Begala, Ron Brown, Ron Brown's 
personal attorney
(who, it turns out, is Johnnie Cochran -- small world, no?), Stan Greenberg 
(the President's pollster),
and a lot of interns were there.
<P>
``It's grim, isn't it?'' I said.
<P>
``I'll say,'' Stan answered. ``The carnage, the loss of life, the breakdown 
of civilized norms, and worse
-- the inaction from the government. We keep saying we're going to do something, 
but we never do.''
<P>
Paul piped up. ``Let's do something,'' he said. ``Let's take off the gloves 
and get into the fight!''
<P>
``I agree,'' said Ron Brown. Cochran pulled him close and whispered in his 
ear for a moment or two.
Then Ron cleared his throat and spoke again. ``I refuse to either 'agree' or 
'disagree' or comment further
on these proceedings until the Special Prosecutor issues his report in full, 
at which time I will respond
and in detailed terms.''
<P>
``We have to do something,'' Stan said. ``The situation is starting to look 
like Bosnia.''
<P>
``Wait a minute,'' I said. ``Aren't we talking about Bosnia?''
<P>
``No. We're talking about the Republican budget,'' Begala said.
<P>
``And its 57% approval rate,'' Stan added.
<P>
``The Bosnia thing is down the hall.''
<P>
I ducked out of the room and headed down the hall. The minute I saw Strobe 
Talbott talking to Wolf
Blitzer, Michael Kramer, R. W. Apple, Brit Hume, Lesley Stahl, Joe Klein, Morton 
Kondracke, Sidney
Blumenthal, and Leon Wieseltier, I knew I was in the right place. I made my 
way through the throng of
people. ``I predicted this, you know,'' was all I heard Strobe say before I 
entered the room. 
<P>
``Hi, Al,'' Bill said.
<P>
``Sorry I'm late,'' I said as I took my seat.
<P>
``That's okay,'' Bill shrugged. ``We just decided to commit ground troops.'
<P>'
``We did?'' Leon Panetta asked.
<P>
``We did?'' General Shalikashvili asked.
<P>
``Didn't we?'' asked Bill.
<P>
``If I may, Mr. President,'' began ``Chris'' Christopher, ``I'd like to clarify 
and perhaps summarize the
sense of today's meeting by clasping my hands like so -- '' Chris folded his 
hands into a little steeple ``
-- and by looking very concerned indeed.''
<P>
As usual, we were all impressed by Chris's ability to get to the heart of the 
matter. The ground-troops
option was tabled for the moment, and in its place, finger-steepling and concerned-looking. 
I think
we've finally licked this thing!
<P>
At that moment, Strobe Talbott poked his head into the room and asked us politely 
if we'd mind moving
-- apparently, he had the room booked for a meeting with his biographers. So 
we hustled out.
This is all Top Secret -- I know I can trust you to be discreet. Plus, by the 
time you read this, I have a
feeling we'll have a new Bosnia policy. Or two.
<P>

<title>Kerrigan:  Why state health-care reforms are failing -- SBSC</title>
</HEAD>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">

<i>November 1995</i>
<hr>
<h2>Why state health-care reforms are failing</h2>
by Karen Kerrigan
<P>
</center><hr><P>
 While President and Mrs. Clinton appear to have
put aside their interest in the nation's so-called &quot;health-care
crisis&quot; for now, the issue has not gone away - especially
for small businesses and entrepreneurs struggling to purchase
insurance for themselves and their employees.
<P>
Washington terms such as &quot;employer mandates&quot; &quot;community
rating&quot; and &quot;guaranteed issue&quot; have suddenly become
staple household vocabulary due to television commercials and
radio talk show hosts.  Ad ideological clashes still exist on
how to make health insurance more accessible and affordable for
all Americans.
<P>
The Clinton plan modeled previously enacted state-based reforms
to achieve universal coverage.  Opposing sides of the debate have
each provided their own analysis of what would occur upon implementation
of the state reforms on a national scale.
<P>
According to Clinton plan advocates, health-care heaven-on-earth
would ensue, while critics have claimed a massive case of the
health-care horrors.
<P>
With the passing of another year, though, the results of these
state reforms have become much clearer.  The reforms included
in the Clinton plan have produced distorted consequences for both
policy holders and insurance companies.
<P>
Experts point to two very specific reforms that have caused headaches
for state legislators and governors who believed making everyone
pay the same insurance rates, and letting consumers get insurance
whenever they needed, was sound public policy.
<P>
Community rating and guaranteed issue became the foundation of
these now-failing reforms.  Pure community rating requires that
everyone pay the same premiums for health insurance regardless
of their age or health risks.  So a healthy 28-year-old pays the
same rate as a 58-year-old smoker.
<P>
For most younger people, who have fewer health risks, logical
economic decision-making forces them to drop coverage.  The massive
decrease in policy holders, especially healthy ones, has driven
companies to jack their rates even higher, causing additional
budget-wary consumers to drop insurance.
<P>
Guaranteed issue essentially requires insurance companies to supply
health insurance to all individuals no matter what their medical
disposition at the time.  Under this scenario, the incentive for
individuals to avoid paying for health insurance until they are
confronted with a serious medical problem are clear.
<P>
The increased costs for insurers are substantial and obviously
passed along to consumers in terms of either higher insurance
rates of fewer insurance choices.
<P>
States have not found the promised utopian effect from these reforms.
 Instead, thousands are dropping their health-care plans altogether
because of skyrocketing premium rates.  In effect, fewer people
have health-care insurance and fewer are in the market to purchase
policies because of high rates as well as the incentive to buy
insurance only when needed.
<P>
States now find that health-care accessibility and affordability
problems have become far worse, not better.  For example:
<UL>
<LI> New York imposed community rating on the small and individual
insurance market in 1993.  Since then, several major insurers
simply stopped serving the market altogether, and by some estimates
more than 500,000 New Yorkers dropped their coverage due to skyrocketing
costs.    
</UL>

<P>
The New York Department of Insurance reported that in some cases,
rates for a single, 30-year-old male increased by 170 percent.
<UL>
<LI>In 1992, New Jersey passed guaranteed issue and a phase-in
to pure community rating by 1997.  This summer, more than 100,000
New Jersey also mandates that anyone who wants insurance must
buy one of five state-designated plans.
<LI>In Vermont, The Burlington Free Press is calling for the repeal
of health-care reform enacted several years ago, which included
community rating and guaranteed issue, and prohibited individual
insurers from charging healthy people low rates.
</UL>


<P>
Now, these 7,500 healthy Vermonters who thought they were part
of a safety net are getting hit with a 60 percent rate increase
from Blue Cross.  The result?  They can't afford their health-care
plans so they are hoping state taxpayers will pick up the tab.
<P>
Not all groups appear to be sold on the negative consequences
of such mandates.  The National Association of Insurance Commissioners,
for example, is crafting model state legislation that advances
the implementation of these failed reforms.  According to a recent
draft of the legislation (called the Small Employer and Individual
Health Insurance Availability Act), community rating and guaranteed
issue will be a part of the model act that is supposed to provide
guidance to states.
<P>
Interestingly, the NAIC's draft bill notes that &quot;this act
is not intended to provide a comprehensive solution to the problem
of affordability of health care or health insurance.&quot;
<P>
In the state of Washington, the legislature repealed an entire
health-care reform act due to the market perversions and impact
it had on state policy holders and taxpayers.
<P>
In other states, market-based reforms such as medical savings
accounts - which allow smaller enterprises to pool for insurance
purchases - and state risk pools to capture those who may be uninsured
are the wave of the future.  To date, 30 states have adopted state
risk pools, and 15 have enacted medical savings account legislation.
<P>
Even Washington, D.C., has gotten the message - no heavy-handed
reform bills coming from this Congress.  The primary reform measures
coming from the new Congress are medical savings accounts, purchasing
pools for small employers and the self-employed, the move toward
tax equity for entrepreneurs to allow laid-off employees to keep
their insurance.
<P>
Elected officials at both the state and national level appear
to be listening to their constituents and those who favor market-based
solutions in health-care reform.  But one wonders, will the NAIC
actually have an audience when it comes to presenting its solutions
- after it's finalized the model bill for making health-care more
&quot;available?&quot;

<P>
Meet Michela Alioto (D), one of the heirs to the
AFL-CIO's
$35 million "windfall"
from American workers that union bosses are using in their effort
to buy back Congress.  With the help of this special "education
fund",
Alioto (D) is mounting a serious challenge to Representative Frank
Riggs (R), who currently represents California's
first congressional district.
<P>
According to FEC reports filed between January and
June, 1996, Alioto (D) has received $74,125.00 in campaign contributions
from organized labor.  Describing the diversity of her contributor
base, Alioto said,<i> "To
be perfectly honest, we had labor and that was it."</i>
 She further candidly asserted that she is "very
proud of that, and <U>will never forget it</u>."
<P>
Should she unseat Riggs (R) on November 5, these
will no doubt be words for her to live by in the 105th Congress.

<CENTER><B>Contempt for New York Union<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
The New York Sheet Metal Workers Local 28 has tried
for 25 years to blame its abysmal record of race discrimination
on everyone but itself.  The U.S. Supreme Court refused to accept
any more excuses and let stand a contempt of court citation. 
The union once again is ordered to stop discriminating against
minorities and to satisfy a court decree of reaching a goal of
29.23% minority membership.
<P>
The case stems from a suit filed by the federal government
in 1971 charging that the union discriminated against blacks and
Hispanics seeking union membership.  Minorities made up only 3
percent of the membership by 1974.  After constant legal challenges,
the union is currently subject to the order to raise minority
membership.
<P>
Over the past quarter century, the union has dragged
its feet and already been cited for contempt.  It has sought to
blame employers, the courts and the law itself for its failure
to provide equal opportunity.
<P>
As the national union bosses seek to portray the
labor movement as the champion of workers, once again we see that
that their own house is not in order. <BR>

<CENTER><I><B>In Style for 1996:</B></I></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>The Union Yes-Man<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
For years unions have spent heavily on public relations
to promote its slogan, "Union
Yes."
 This year the AFL-CIO is sinking up to $500,000,000 dollars into
its effort to buy back control of government.
<P>
In addition to buying up television time and traveling
door-to-door, the unions have unveiled a fresh crop of political
candidates who are taking the union money in their run for public
office.
<P>
Inside-the-beltway political pundits are calling
these challengers "Union
Yes-Men."
<P>
How does a Union Yes-Man stand out from the rest
of the pack.  The following "test"
is provided by an avid reader of <I>Labor Watch</I>:<BR>
<P>
If your army of campaign "volunteers"
all have Washington D.C. license plates, you might be a Union
Yes-Man.
<P>
If the phrase, "Pardon me," is a campaign payback, not a Miss Manners' nicety, you might be a Union Yes-Man.
<P>
If you plan to dress up as a "ghost
employee"
for Halloween, you might be a Union Yes-Man.<BR>
<P>

<CENTER><B>No, We Mean Other Oppressive Employers!<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
When it comes to watching out for the rights of workers,
AFL-CIO has a glaring blind spot-
its own employees!  The labor federation is under severe criticism
for forcing its "Union
Summer"
workers to put in excessive <U>unpaid</U> overtime.
<P>
In a complaint to the Department of Labor, Rep. Cass
Ballenger (R-NC) demanded an investigation into reports that participants
were given a weekly stipend of $210 and free housing and required
to put in 12-hour days.  The Workforce Protections subcommittee
chairman calculated that at least one participant apparently receive
an hourly wage of $2.76, without any overtime premium,
when the minimum wage was $4.25 an hour.
<P>
A response from the Labor Department may come soon,
but the union reaction to the charges was immediate.  
<P>
Deborah Dugan of the AFL-CIO in response to the charges
remarked, "We
feel very confident that we complied with the relevant laws,"
<I>The Washington Times</I> reported.
<P>
Why do union leaders always appear so defensive when
the Labor Department goes after them?<BR>

</B></CENTER>
<P>
Michael Petyo, a Republican challenger running against incumbent
Rep. Peter Visclosky in Indiana, is proud of his union family
heritage.  His letterhead boldly states his credentials,
"Businessman,Union Man, Veteran."
<P>
But labor leaders have turned on Petyo, by distributing his positions
on issues that he says he was never contacted about.  In fact,
Petyo supports 7 of the 8 positions that the AFL-CIO claims he
opposes in their "voter"
guide.
<P>
Here is the text of a letter sent to Jerry T. Payne, Secretary
Treasury of the Committee on Political Education, Indiana AFL-CIO:
<BR>

<P>
<I>Per our conversation by phone this morning, please understand
that I am VERY disappointed that my brothers in the AFL-CIO would
choose to do something as irresponsible as to report my positions
on union issues incorrectly.  Saying you assumed negative responses
because I failed to send in a survey I never got is beyond insulting.
 This is particularly true in light of your "voter"
guide claim that "all
information contained [was] obtained from press releases, surveys,
and questionnaires."
 I consider this to be a small time, underhanded way to operate.
 I expect and demand more from my union brothers and especially
from my leadership.</I>
<P>
<I>As I said, my campaign received no survey.  Further, if I had,
I certainly would have responded quite differently from the false
information being sent out by the AFL-CIO about me.  I am a member
of Carpenter's Local
1005 out of Hobart, Indiana.  My son is also a member of 1005.
 My wife is a member of Foodserver's
Local 1 out of Chicago, Illinois.  My family is a union family.
 You have attacked something that I have worked to instill in
my family.</I>
<P>
<I>I can not begin to try to understand nor explain to my family,
my friends, my neighbors, my fellow workers, and others why my
own union brothers and sisters would want to publish such outright
lies about me.  I am at a loss with what to do or say.  Your actions
in printing <B>Stand Up: For Indiana's
Working Families: AFL-CIO Voter Guide by Issues</B> were absolutely
wrong.</I>
<P>
<I>John Sweeney said to me as a union man that weneed to support
our own.  As a union man, I agreed with him and decided it was
time to get one of our own elected.  As a union man, I feel my
working brothers and sisters should know the truth about both
me and my campaign.  I believe that this entire affair is a contrived
inaccuracy.</I>
<P>
<I>I expect to see from my union leadership a public retraction
of these statements.  I look forward to them showing their support
for one of their own.</I>
<P>
<I>God Bless You and thank you in advance for your help in correcting
this injustice.<BR>
</I>
<P>
In a letter to Petyo, the AFL-CIO representative Payne writes:
<BR>

<P>
<I>Our record indicated, prior to receiving your fax today, that
you had NOT responded in writing to our questionnaire.  Therefore
we assumed you were opposed to the issues or else you simply did
not wish to have a written record of where you stand on the issues.
<BR>
</I>
<P>
If Petyo was a Democrat, we have to assume that they would of,
in fact, supported one of their own.<BR>

<CENTER><B>Hotel Strike Keeps Going and Going and </B></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><B>Going and . . .<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
Striking workers continue to picket at the Frontier Hotel in Las
Vegas, Nevada in what is currently the longest strike in the United
States. Over 500 workers walked off the job on September 21, 1991
because the hotel was seeking a contract with terms different
from the pact agreed to by other Strip hotels.
<P>
AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer, Richard Trumka, during his annual
visit to the strike, said that the strikers "are
teaching workers of America what solidarity is all about."
 Trumka also boasts that during the strike, not one striker has
crossed the picket line and that they have maintained pickets
24 hours a day.  
<P>
Striker Stats: Strikers have been receiving three meals a day
(free); 101 babies have been born to strikers, and union leaders
have encouraged other union members to participate in the strike
when visiting Las Vegas.
<P>
Anyone care to wager an end date to this strike?<BR>

<CENTER><B>LIUNA PAC Money Flows Freely to Democrats<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
Labor union leaders are "betting
the House" that Democrats
take control of Congress next year.  Their $35 million-dollar
ad campaign is augmented by over $40 million in PAC contributions.
<P>
  The Laborers International Union of North America (LIUNA) 
(the topic of many <I>Labor Watch </I>articles dealing with its
ties to organized crime and its relationship to the White House)
is feeding the campaign
coiffeurs of 209 Democrats through its PAC, the Laborers Political
League.  To date, $750,000 of the PAC money has made its way to
Democrat incumbents and challengers to vulnerable Republicans
this election cycle.
<P>
Countless LIUNA officials have been convicted of state and federal
offenses during the past 20 years.  And, LIUNA has been described
as a "union with clear
ties to organized crime"
by New York's Organized
Crime Task Force and the President's
Commission on Organized Crime.  
<P>
In 1994, a Justice Department report stated that: "LIUNA
has been infiltrated at all levels by corrupt individuals and
organized crime figures who have exploited their control and influence
over the union for personal gain and to the detriment of the union.
 LIUNA union officers and employees at all levels, including the
general presidency, have been chosen, subject to the approval
of, and have been controlled by, various members and associates
of organized crime."
<P>
Recently, questions have been posed by the media and legal experts
regarding Arthur Coia's
(head of LIUNA) friendship with President Clinton and the First
Lady, and whether the Justice Department is giving LIUNA favorable
treatment because of Coia's
personal ties to the Clintons.
<P>
The legal cloud over LIUNA has not stopped  Democrats from taking
LPL's money.  
<P>
In the House, Laborers Political League money is being doled out
to key Democrats in the leadership, and those ranking members
who would chair committees if the Democrats take control of Congress
next year.  
<P>
Here is a list of those Democrats and the amount of money recieved
(so far) from the Laborers Political League in 1996:<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Democrat  Position  Laborers $ $ $ $</FONT></B>
<P>
Dick Gephardt Minority Leader $9,000
<P>
David Bonior  Minority Whip $10,000
<P>
Martin Frost  DCCC Chairman $10,000
<P>
David Obey  Appropriations $6,500
<P>
Martin Sabo  Budget  $3,000
<P>

<P>
John LaFalce  Small Business $2,000
<P>
James Oberstar Transportation $7,000
<P>
Charlie Rangel Ways and Means $7,000 <BR>

<P>
What type of Return of Investment will LIUNA get for its generosity?
 Good question.  Too bad the media isn't
paying attention.

<B>Christmas in October<BR>
</B>
<P>
October 3, 1996 will go down in the history books as a red letter day in the struggle to break free of the shackles of reactionary union leaders and their congressional lackeys.  On this day, the Senate broke the Kennedy fillibuster over a labor provision in the transportation bill, and the Labor Department erased its illicit and illegal striker replacement regulations.
<P>
The Kennedy fillibuster was designed to prevent a technical correction which would have clarified that Federal Express has always been, and shall continue to be, covered by the Railway Labor Act (RLA).  Under the RLA, unions must organize all workers of a company in a nationwide system.  Union organizers have been trying to ignore that law and organize smaller portions of FedEx under the rival National Labor Relations Act.
<P>
The National Labor Relations Board has been considering this issue for almost five years.  Now that the AFL-CIO controls a majority of the votes on the Board, including the vote of former Kennedy staffer Sarah M. Fox, the agency was poised to reverse the law to favor the unions.
<P>
Also, on October 3, the Labor Department officially nullified regulations implementing the striker replacement executive order.  That order was blocked by a federal appeals court as an unlawful power grab by the President.
<P>
While the nullification of the rules closes the official book on this sordid story of special interest pandering, the theme remains alive in the Democrat platform for 1996.  That document states:  "We support the President's actions to stop the government from procuring goods and services from companies that [hire permanent replacements]."  The action, though deemed illegal by the courts, is still supported by the President and his side-kicks John Sweeney, Dick Gephardt, and Tom Daschle.
<P>
<a name="two"></a>
<B>Psst, the Law is Still the Law<BR>
</B>
<P>
Leave the Sweeney/Clinton Labor Board out of the case and the law remains the law.  In other words, a federal appeals court recently ruled that arbitrators still do not have the power to stick union contracts onto nonunion employers.
<P>
In the case involving Zcon Builders in California, the court upheld  long-standing precedent recognizing the separateness of different subsidiaries.  The union claimed that a nonunion firm was the alter ego of a unionized company, and sought to enforce its collective bargaining agreement against both.  An arbitrator issued an award of back pay against both firms, thus assuming power to act against the company that never signed the contract.  The appeals court rejected this power grab, ruling the arbitrator overstepped his authority.
<P>
The case is significant as a reaffirmation of the legitimate practice of double breasting, where businesses operate both union and nonunion subsidiaries.  It is symbolic because it comes only four months after the Sweeny/Clinton Labor Board issued its most pro-union decision to date on this or any other topic.  In the Board's Manganaro decision, reported in Labor Watch (5/17/96), the union activists on the Board ignored past precedent and ruled that unions can force contracts on nonunion subsidiaries.  The decision opened the door for imposing union membership and dues onto nonunion workers without a secret ballot election.
<P>
The good news is that the AFL-CIO policy machine has not yet annexed the federal courts.  Whether the NLRB can return to  neutral ground remains to be seen.
<P>
<a name="three"></a>
<B>Corporate Campaign Against Bridgestone/Firestone Hits the Information Superhighway<BR>
</B>
<P>
The United Steel Workers have expanded the venue of their corporate campaign against Bridgestone/Firestone from the traditional picket activities at subsidiary companies to the Internet.  The union's new world wide web site asks "cyber protesters" to send pro-union messages to the company.
<P>
Several municipal bodies, retailers and other companies have boycotted products and services of Bridgestone/Firestone.  Saturn reportedly is replacing Firestone Tires with another brand on all new cars at customers' request.
<P>
Despite the two year strike and corporate campaign, Bridgestone officials report that the company has maintained record sales and round the clock operations.  Late last month, Bridgestone/Firestone sent recall notices to all remaining strking workers.
<P>
<a name="four"></a>
<B>Labor Unions Top List of OSHA Training Grant Recipients<BR>
</B>
<P>
Labor unions have never shied away from the U.S. government money tree, and it seems that green-backs are ripe for the picking from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).  OSHA will disburse over $2 million in training grants to 26 non-profit groups to fund training  and research programs, with emphasis on ergonomics, back injury prevention, and safety and health programs.
<P>
Labor unions can expect to receive over one million dollars of the grant money.

<B>Rank-and-File vs. Sweeney<BR>
</B>
<P>
<dd>On September 1, 1996, AFL-CIO President John
Sweeney wrote an op-ed in <I>The Washington Times</I> defending
the union's use of members dues to subsidize political activities.
 On September 10, a union member responded.  Here is a brief excerpt
from the letter:
<P>
<i>As a member of an AFL-CIO-affiliated union,
I found John Sweeney's Commentary article (&quot;Debating the
AFL-CIO's Campaign Role:  Resource Allocation,&quot;- Sep. 1)
misleading and untruthful.</I>
<P>
<dd>Mr. Sweeney errs by stating that &quot;no
individual is ever forced to pay the pennies it costs each month
for his or her union's political activities.&quot;  While the
assessed amount for the &quot;grass-roots action and advertising
in the media&quot; he speaks of are small, not all unions are
complying with federal law prohibiting the use of dues for political
purposes.  I demanded a refund from the national president of
my union;  he refused to even consider this, claiming it would
jeopardize the union's standing with the AFL-CIO.  Thus, Mr. Sweeney's
claim is a lie.  While the individual amount of money may be small,
the principle being violated is not. 
<P>
<dd>...Four years of Clinton/Gore has been too
much.  This union member will be voting for Dole/Kemp this fall
because the Democrats have nothing to offer but higher taxes,
fear, misery and less freedom.  Mr. Sweeney is another power-grabbing
liberal, like the man he supports for the White House this fall.

<B>Clinton Administration Finally
Gives Up On Its Illegal Power Grab<BR>
</B>
<P>
<dd>As<I> Labor Watch</I> reader's recall, on
March 8, 1995, President Clinton issued an executive order to
bar the government from contracting with companies that fire and
permanently replace their striking workers.  The order applied
to contracts over $100,000.
<P>
<dd>The President was temporarily blocked by a
federal judge, and a federal appeals court unanimously overturned
his order on February 2, 1996.  The judge in the case said that
Clinton's actions violated federal labor law &quot;which guarantees
the right to hire permanent replacements.&quot;  They also called
the administration's arguments &quot;silly&quot; and &quot;far-fetched.&quot;
 The President's order would have covered federal government contracts
totaling $437 billion or 6.5% of GNP.
<P>
<dd>According to the senior counsel at the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce -- one of the parties that filed suit against
the order -- the decision &quot;means that when federal labor
law grants a business a certain right, the President can't just
come in and take it away by executive fiat.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<dd>The Administration decided this week not to
take the case to the Supreme Court, but Labor Secretary Robert
Reich loyally defended the President's action even though the
order was viewed as &quot;far-reaching&quot; by the courts.<BR>
<P>
<a name="three"></a>
<B>Mini Task Force on Health Care
Reform<BR>
</B>
<P>
<dd>All systems are &quot;GO&quot; for the Clinton
Administration's push for guaranteed (government-run) universal
health care coverage.  The President has tapped Secretaries Robert
B. Reich of Labor and Donna Shalala of Health &amp; Human Services
to lead the National Commission on Health Care Quality.  Membership
of the advisory panel is expected to include labor union leaders
and representatives from the health, insurance and &quot;business&quot;
communities.  The Commission, among other things, will &quot;study
the need for consumer protections, guarantee quality of care,
and assure access to health care services.&quot;
<P>
<dd>Reich and Shalala replace the dynamic duo,
First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and guru Ira Magaziner, whose
failed top-to-bottom health care reform is credited as a key reason
why Democrats where voted out of Congress in 1994.  With labor
unions and the left elated with the new commission, it is projected
that the Reich-Shalala proposals will be reminiscent of the old
Clinton-health care plan.  Even with the passage of Kennedy-Kassebaum,
President Clinton's &quot;business agenda&quot; in his second

<dd>Secretary of Labor Robert B. Reich's nationwide
sweatshop sweep recently took him to DeCoster Egg Farm in Turner,
Maine.  With a media cadre and state Democrat legislators in tow,
the U.S. Department of Labor's investigation into housing and
labor violations resulted in a $3.6 million fine against the company.
<P>
<dd>DeCoster Egg Farms is no small-time closet
operations.  It is the town's biggest taxpayer and employer, with
360 employees.  According to a city official, &quot;The town's
own inspectors had long insured that the egg farm kept up to local
codes.&quot; 
<P>
<dd> However, DeCoster agreed to comply with the
DOL findings, including purchasing new housing for workers.  Unfortunately,
the story does not end here.  The Reich investigation-turned-media
expos&eacute; damaged company sales and tarnished the company's
image - despite quick compliance.
<P>
<dd>The Administration's &quot;reinvention initiatives&quot;
calling for partnerships between government and business to correct
labor violations have proven to be empty promises.  We can expect
the 1996 presidential campaign to showcase  Reich as he conducts
more inappropriate media-laden crackdowns to make the news - 
not a difference -  on companies that supposedly violate labor
laws<BR>

<B>Unhatched and Mobilized - </B>
<br>
<B>Federal Employees Gear Up for '96<BR>
</B>
<P>
<dd>With more than 3 million federal employees now &quot;unhatched&quot;
to fully participate in partisan political activities if they
want to, President Clinton has unleashed a tremendous political
force than can help him win this November with the liberalization
of the Hatch Act in 1993.  A diversity of interests have long
opposed overhauling the 1939 Hatch Act - a bill that bars federal
workers from participating in various political activities, and
in theory, protects them from political coercion.
<P>
<dd>The main assertion has been that liberalizing the Act would give
more power to unions, and thus Democrats.  Federal union members
who can now attend Chicago as delegates to the Democrat National
Convention have not been shy about sharing what they plan to do
with their new found freedom.  As quoted in <I>The</I> <I>Washington
Post</I> on August 26, Myke Reed of the American Postal Workers
Union (APWU) says, &quot;Surveys showed that 40% of union households
voted Republican in 1994...It's not going to happen again.&quot;
<P>
<dd>The National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU) also plans to flex
its partisan muscle.  The NTEU is targeting 39 congressional seats
- those who are &quot;anti-federal employee lawmakers.  The President
of the NTEU is quoted as saying that President Clinton's changes
in the law allow them to &quot;have a real opportunity this time
to influence the outcome of a number of elections.&quot;<BR>
<P>
<a name="two"></a>
<B>Mean-Extreme Republicans are at it Again...First
They're Cutting Medicare, Now They're Raiding Pensions<BR>
</B>
<P>
<dd>The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) is encouraging
Democratic candidates to say that Republicans in Congress &quot;voted
to allow corporate raids of employee pension funds&quot; and &quot;voted
to allow companies to take the money without informing their employees
or retirees.&quot;
<P>
<dd>According a survey conducted by Stan Greenberg (oh great health
care pollster for President Clinton), the pension message tested
by him is the strongest campaign weapon yet.  A memo from the
DCCC states, &quot;The pension raids are the strongest reason
to vote against a GOP Member of Congress this fall.&quot;  The
second strongest message is &quot;Cutting medicare to pay for
tax cuts for the wealthy.&quot;  
<P>
<dd>Both claims are false, but truth has nothing to do with labor
leaders wanting a Democrat Congress next  year.  The AFL-CIO is
running ads pushing both messages.
<P>
<dd>In the DCCC memo, there is no mention of the specific &quot;pension
raid&quot; legislation to back up their claims for candidates.
 For the record, the Republican Reconciliation Bill eased the
tax burden for businesses which chose to use excess pension funds
above 125% of current pension liability for other business/economic
activity.  This minor adjustment to the tax law is &quot;the big
pension raid&quot; labor unions refer to in their rhetoric, and
in their multi-million dollar ad campaigns.  The change in law
simply encourages businesses to reinvest excess pension funds
into the company to create more opportunities for their workers.
<BR>
<P>
<a name="three"></a>
<B>Media Reality Check -</B>
<B> Union Dominance of the Democrat Party<BR>
</B>
<P>
<dd>Most news surveys have found that union members made up approximately
34% of delegates to the Democrat convention - a figure kindly
passed over as trivial matter.  
<P>
<dd>According to the Media Research Center in its daily coverage of
media reporting on the convention, the media has reported that
union members dominate the delegate count in Chicago, but they
have failed to raise questions concerning &quot;who controls the
party.&quot;   The Center's <I>Media Reality Check '96</I> reports,
&quot;Only 21% of GOP delegates said they were part of the religious
right, but in San Diego, CBS worried about their having too much
influence.  On Sunday, August 11, Face the Nation guest gave five
ominous questions.&quot;  But television guests in Chicago have
not been asked similar questions about control of the Democrat
party relative to union influence. 
<P>
<dd> Here are the number of delegates that the major unions sent to
Chicago:  the AFL-CIO sent 811 delegates to the Democrat National
Convention; National Education Association sent over 400 delegates;
and the American Federation of Teachers sent 150 delegates.<BR>
<P>
<a name="four"></a>
<B>Operation Liberty Bell<BR>
</B>
<P>
<dd>The National Right to Work Committee mounted a challenge to organized
labor's $35 million campaign against Republican members of Congress
up for re-election by kicking off a national campaign called &quot;Operation
Liberty Bell.&quot; 
<P>
<dd> The National Right to Work Committee campaign will inform workers
of their <U>Beck </U>right to a refund of the portion of their
union dues that is used for purposes other than collective bargaining
- for example, political campaigns and lobbying activities.
<P>
<dd>An April 1996 Frank Luntz and Associates poll found that 62% of
union members opposed the use of their dues for negative political
advertising against Republicans; 59% would ask for a refund of
their dues; and 78% did not know they could file a form to stop
payment of their dues for political purposes.

<b>Education Lobby Shifts Political Strategy --<br>
NEA Has New Presence at GOP Convention</b>
<p>
<dd>While the bulk of the education lobby's PAC money is dedicated to electing Democrats, the National Education Association ( NEA) claims that the '94 elections were a "wake-up call" that required their presence at the GOP convention in San Diego.
<p>
<dd>According to a new poll of NEA members, the union found that its rank-and-file is evenly split in its political affiliation -- one-third are Republicans, one-third are Democrats, and one-third are Independents. The poll also reports that union members feel that the NEA is too partisan.
<p>
<dd>Accordingly, the NEA held several events with Republicans this week at the Convention -- in order to build bridges.
<p>
<dd>A recent report showed that close to 99% of the NEA's political action funds are directed to Democrats, but nonetheless, the education lobby claims that they will not try to elect Democrats "but a pro-education majority."
<p>
<dd>There 34 NEA delegates to the GOP convention and the Republican Mainstream Coalition (liberal Republicans) hosted an event to discuss how to avoid "cuts in education." Republican members of Congress speaking at the program included Senator James Jeffords, and Representatives Sherwood Boehlert and Jim Leach.
<p>
<dd>NEA president-elect Bob Chase says he came to San Diego in search of "common ground" -- but GOP insiders say the teacher's lobby can first begin with common sense, by ending their political attacks on Republicans.
<p>
<a name="reversal"></a>
<b>A Reversal of Fortune</b>
<p>
<dd>The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) was forced to practice-what-it-preaches, in a reverse discrimination suit against the Commission from an EEOC employee. A federal district court recently sided with the plaintiff, a white-male attorney for the EEOC, who charged that he was denied promotions 10 times between 1984-1992.
<p>
<dd>The EEOC and Justice Department continue to remain tight-lipped on the case. The plaintiff received outstanding job performance appraisals in addition to receiving certification from a management training course during his long tenure at the Commission. The federal district court awarded the plaintiff $150,000 in damages and $300,000 in back pay.
<p>
<dd>The EEOC initiates discrimination suits against employers, but was reminded in court that, "Federal agencies such as defendant EEOC are under a particularly compelling mandate to adhere strictly to the requirements of Title VII."
<p>
<a name="objectors"></a>
<b>Conscientious Objectors Have Rights, Too</b>
<p>
<dd>A public sector union must accommodate the religious beliefs of a Roman Catholic worker who opposes union stances on social issues, a U.S. District Court judge ruled earlier this month. The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) must allow the union member to donate to charity, an amount equal to his mandatory union fees, so that he does not inadvertently contribute to causes he objects to on moral or religious grounds.
<p>
<dd>The worker objected to positions taken by the union on abortion and the death penalty, and also to "supporting an organization (AFSCME) that champion theses issues," according to the judge. Not only was the union ordered to allow the worker to pay an amount equal to his union fees to an "agreed upon" charitable organization, but it was ordered to refund his fees from 1991.
<p>
<a name="overhaul"></a>
<b>Time to Overhaul the NLRB</b>
<p>
<dd>The Small Business Survival (SBS) Foundation released a new report documenting the bias of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and its interpretation of labor law. The report also outlines reform measures to move both labor law and the NLRB into the 21 st century.
<p>
<dd>According to the study entitled "Time to Overhaul Labor Law and the NLRB," the NLRB has taken judicial activism to the extreme  blatant political NLRB decisions have been consistently reversed by the courts who hear such cases. In addition, current NLRB Chairman William Gould has publicly stated his support or opposition to various pieces of legislation before Congress -- an act that is unprecedented for what is supposed to be an impartial arbritor of labor law.
<p>

<CENTER>Union Money Well Spent - New Board's Decision Advances
Labor Agenda<BR>
</CENTER>
</b>
<P>
A new Administrative Review Board set up by Labor Secretary Reich
in June, has expanded the Davis-Bacon Act to include more workers.
 The Davis-Bacon Act requires government-determined prevailing
wages be paid to workers on taxpayer-funded construction projects.
<P>
Specifically, the panel ruled that <U>suppliers</U> to a federally-funded
construction project also must pay Davis-Bacon wages to their
workers even though those workers do not work at the construction
site.  In reaching its decision, the Review Board had to reverse
the decision of an administrative law judge, and evade a 1994
federal circuit court ruling that exempted off-site work from
the payment of &quot;prevailing wages.&quot;  
<P>
In this case, Bechtel Constructors was getting the raw materials
it needed (for a federal construction project) from a quarry which
did not pay prevailing wages to the quarry workers.  They must
now pay these workers back wages in accordance with the Davis-Bacon
Act.
<P>
 One ironic feature of the case is that the defendant, Bechtel
Constructors, is a big beneficiary of the Davis-Bacon Act and
opposes its repeal.   Building trade unions, which have contributed
heavily to congressional Democrats and to the Clinton-Gore campaign,
have long sought this specific change in the way the Labor Department
administers the Davis-Bacon Act.<BR>
<P>
<a name="two"></a>
<CENTER><B>There He Goes Again<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) should have greater
powers to penalize employers, according to its chairman, William
B. Gould.  In the same breath, the chairman then criticized the
Republican Congress for seeking to &quot;emasculate&quot; his
agency by threatening budget cuts.
<P>
Chairman Gould has never missed an opportunity to express his
view that labor laws should be tilted in favor of unions.  His
speech this week to the California Labor Federation was no exception.
 But the union theme of Republican bashing was an added feature.
 Gould was effusive in his expression of thanks to California
labor bosses and Democrats for their efforts to protect his budget
and their agenda.
<P>
Most Board watchers agree that members should not criticize the
very law they are sworn to uphold.  Chairman Gould has consistently
flaunted this rule of professionalism and decorum.  His partisan
attacks also continue to destroy any pretext of impartiality.
<BR>
<P>
<a name="three"></a>
<CENTER><B>Non-Union Hotels and Democrats<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
A major Chicago labor union is upset that the Democrats have included
three nonunion hotels on the list of &quot;Democrat National Convention
Hotels&quot; for next month's big convention, <I>The</I> <I>Washington
Times</I> reports.  The Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees'
Chicago local had issued a list of nonunion establishments to
be shunned at the convention, and apparently Democrat planners
were compelled to ignore the union directive due to a shortage
of room space.
<P>
The Democratic National Convention Committee (DNCC) recently conferred
official convention status upon two Marriott Hotels and  Swisshotel.
 Marriott hotels have long been prominent on every union blacklist
because its staff refuses to unionize.
<P>
Although Bill Clinton and Al Gore plan to patronize a union hotel
for the convention, the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees
are stunned and appalled at the DNCC's decision.  <BR>
<P>
<a name="four"></a>
<CENTER><B>Bond Assails Clinton Veto of TEAM Act<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
As expected, President Clinton vetoed the Teamwork for Employment
and Management (TEAM) Act, and one U.S. Senator took Clinton's
action to task. 
<P>
 Senator Kit Bond, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business,
said that political pandering by the President on behalf of organized
labor played a major role in Clinton's decision to veto the TEAM
act.
<P>
Bond said an alarming pattern had developed.  &quot;President
Clinton's message to small business is 'get to the back of the
line; what labor wants, labor gets,' &quot; he said.
<P>
The TEAM Act amends the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB)
to allow employees and managers at nonunion companies to resolve
workplace issues such as scheduling, safety and health, and even
things like free coffee and company softball teams.  The legislation
would not allow employee teams to act as unions since they could
not engage in collective bargaining or act as exclusive representatives
of employees.
<P>
&quot;Opponents and even some misguided individuals in the news
media have claimed that the TEAM Act would allow 'company dominated
unions,' an assertion that is absolutely false,' &quot; said Senator
Bond.  
<P>
Once again, President Clinton has proven that the only &quot;team&quot;
he'll play on is organized labor.<BR>

<b>D.C. Labor Unions Derail Health Clinic for At-Risk Residents</b><br>

The July 1 edition of <i>The Washington Post</i> reports that labor unions representing District of Columbia health workers have halted efforts to open a health clinic for low-income residents of the North Capitol Street area of Washington, D.C.
<p>
After hearing many complaints about the shoddy treatment at her neighborhood clinic, community activist Alverta Munlyn decided that her neighbors would benefit if they, along with private and public organizations, came together to operate the city's nearby faltering clinic.  Munlyn also figured out that the new clinic would save the financially-strapped city $700,000 initially, and $1.3 million annually in subsequent years.
<p>
Munlyn convinced Providence Hospital to manage the clinic, Georgetown University to provide the doctors; public health officials to close the faltering clinic to subsidize hers; and finally, Munlyn persuaded Mayor Marion Barry to support her efforts.
<p>
But then the labor unions stepped in. Labor leaders -- fearful that labor infested hospitals would close if too many low-income residents chose private clinics -- believe that the city's poor should be cared for through a network of union-supported services. And now, city officials who once proclaimed the clinic as the perfect model for public-private partnership, have backed off from their earlier endorsements and offer weak reassurances that Munlyn's idea will be achieved.
<p>
D.C. Council member Jack Evans (D-Ward 2), outraged at the union's narrow position, says that labor unions should put their "interests aside for the better interest of the community."
<p>
But, the labor unions have not backed-off, putting their interests above the low-income residents in the District of Columbia. <i>Labor Watch</i> concludes that when labor leaders talk about universal health care for all, they only approve of such services when the jobs and money are fimnelled through them.

If the Sweeney/Clinton Board Thinks It's Bad, It Must Be Awful
</b><br>
What is black and white, and walked all over? The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) settlement agreement with striking unions at the <i>Detroit News</i> and the <i>Detroit Free Press</i>.
<p>
Fed up with picket line misconduct, the NLRB is threatening Detroit's striking newspaper unions with a court injunction if the misconduct is not ended. Earlier in the labor dispute, the NLRB reached an "informal" settlement with the striking unions in which the "unions pledged not to block entrances to the newspaper's property, threaten or coerce replacement workers or employees who have crossed the picket lines, or engage in other strike misconduct." According to the Board's Detroit Regional Office, the agreement was breached "almost as the ink was drying." Unions however deny involvement in picket line misconduct, and say the violence is caused by the newspaper's private security.
<p>
The NLRB is currently seeking a "formal" settlement with the unions. If broken, the unions would be forced to end the misconduct and could force fines and other penalties.

Labor-loving Republicans Snubbed by Labor
</b><br>
A two-term, labor-loving Republican will not receive the '96 endorsement of local labor leaders as he did in 1994.
<p>
But maybe someone forgot to tell Rep. Jack Quinn (R-NY) that he's not a Democrat. Nope -- Sorry! Buffalo Labor Relations Council President John Kaczorowski did in fact remind Quinn of his party status.
<p>
According to a July 15 article in <i>The Washington Times</i>, Kaczorowski said, "We even told him if he were a Democrat he wouldn't be having this problem." The Labor Council has endorsed Quinn's opponent -- a Democrat -- even though Quinn voted against NAFTA, against the TEAM Act, led the fight for the Family and Medical Leave Act, and authored the bill in the House to hike the minimum wage.
<p>
Quinn is appealing the local decision to the state AFL-CIO, but it looks bleak for a reversal. According to the state director, overturning the decision remains questionable. "Basically we don't feel that the labor agenda has progressed much this year," she said. The state AFL-CIO will announce their endorsements mid-September.

Teamsters Will Be Teamsters
</b><br>
The Teamster's nominating convention at the Philadelphia Convention center was disrupted early on by shouts, jeers and rude chants by supporters of James Hoffa, the challenger to incumbent president Ron Carey. Carey's detractors claim that he has taken power from the locals, denied democratic process to reform-minded Teamsters, and drained the union's finances. At the convention, Carey refused to allow anyone to speak in opposition to his appointment of 120 unelected delegates. A voice vote on the issue was held, and Carey declared victory despite an apparent majonty of opposing votes. He ignored calls for a stand-up vote, and pandemonium ensued.
<p>
The booing, cheers, and catcalls drowned out the Pledge of Allegiance, Carey's speech, and those of everyone else who came to the podium with the exception of Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua's invocation. Sen. Arlen Specter (R-PA) was invited to speak, but both his introduction by Carey and the Senator's attempted remarks were overpowered by the anarchy. Afler delivering a scathing criticism of the Teamsters' behavior, Specter left in disgust. When asked whether the day's disruption had discredited the union, one official responded, "We're Teamsters, we're not choir boys."

<a name="one"></a>
 <center><h2>Right-to-Work Law Goes Down in Senate</h2></center><p>
Twenty-one states have right-to-work rules, but the Senate didn't come close to applying the law nationwide.  The law would bar union contracts from requiring nonmembers to pay dues as a condition of employment.<p>
Sounding like a limited government type-of-guy, Senator Ted Kennedy used the following rationale in leading the charge to kill the bill.  He said:<p>
We do not want the long arm of the federal government interfering with the legitimate interests of the states.<p>
<hr>
<a name="two"></a>
 <center><h2>Clinton: Not a TEAM Player</center></h2><p>

The Teamwork for Employees and Management (TEAM) Act was approved by the Senate (53 to 46) yesterday, with identical legislation overwhelmingly approved by the House last year.  <p>
But don't expect the President to sign the legislation even though he touts the concept of teamwork in the workplace. Organized labor deeply opposes the measure, and surely Clinton will veto it. <p> 
The TEAM Act amends the National Labor Relations Act to permit teams composed of employees and employers in nonunion settings to address mutual concerns in the workplace including scheduling, work assignments, health and safety issues, training, job descriptions and work rules.<p>
Clinton portrayed the TEAM Act as a vehicle for company-dominated unions to suppress workers and undermine employees rights to elect their own representatives.<p>
Many businesses have abandoned the workplace teams practice in fear that they may become the target of a National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) complaint, with the Board ruling against them as they have with several companies.<p>
The only TEAM Clinton is on these days is big labor.  Another election-year payoff appears to be in the works.<p>

<a name="three"></a>
<center><h2> Labor Chat</center></h2><p>

A chatroom on the Internet found some rank-and-file members disillusioned with their former union.
In this case, former members of the Wisconsin State Employees Union were lamenting about the AFSCME (American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees) judicial process.  Not happy with how their local union was operating, a union member thought AFSCME could help.  
According to the former union member:<p>
Anyone that's gone through AFSCME 'judicial process' knows it's essentially a political process designed to suppress union democracy.  That's true for the labor movement, and which is part of the reason there's only about a 16% national union membership.  Think about it: Who wants to pay dues to be suppressed?
Good question - and one which more union members are asking.<p>
 
 
  <hr>
<a name="four"></a>
 <center><h2>Another One Bites the Dust, Part III</center></h2><p>
Another union boss being ousted for corruption may sound like just another ho-hum story, but its big news for the 26,000 members of the Carpenters District Council in New York.<p>
The union took action against the local leadership after discovering well documented ties between several New York crime families and district council leaders, the preferential treatment of individuals tied to crime families at the expense of rank-and-file members, the use of union funds to pay the legal costs of defending council leaders against charges of corruption and the misuse of members benefit funds.<p>
One of the ousted leaders, Council President Frederick W. Devine, succeeded Paschall McGuinnes who is the current secretary-treasurer of the AFL-CIO Building and Construction Trades Department.  Devine, who was earning $360,000 a year, allowed preferential hiring for mob-tied workers at a major New York City construction project, and attempted to establish a labor-management cooperation fund that would have paid him an additional $175,000.<p>
<hr>
<a name="five"></a>
 <center><h2>An Inspector In Every Worksite</center></h2><p>

As reported in past editions of Labor Watch, the  Labor Party was founded in Cleveland, Ohio June 6 - 9.  Labor Watch promised to bring you more platform highlights that define the agenda of the new party.  In platform item #15, the Labor Party calls for an increase in the number of worksite inspections as well as the placement of in-house inspectors in all workplaces.  <p>
The platform reads:<p>
<ul>
<li><i>For starters, we need the right to act and to enforce any and all safety and health regulations.
We call for national legislation to train and deputize workers to be on the job inspectors in each and every workplace.<p>
<li>Such inspectors should be protected against corporate harassment and discrimination and should be able to do their job without fear of reprisal.<p>
<li>Such inspectors should have the power to shut down hazardous operations; enforce the right of every worker to refuse unsafe work;should have the power to investigate incidents to uncover their root cause; and to force the implementation of their findings.<p>
</i><ul><p>
In other words, the Labor Party is simply calling on business owners to allow the government and unions total management control of their operations.<p>

<P>
<a name="one"></a>
<B><i>The NLRB <FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">,</FONT> Unabashed
Advocate for Big Labor<BR>
</B></i>
<P>
Here is the ultimate proof that Organized Labor has received what
it paid for <FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">,</FONT> a National Labor
Relations Board (NLRB) that will satisfy the union agenda in every
instance.
<P>
Last week, NLRB Chairman Gould cast aside all sense of propriety,
decorum and lip service to impartiality by publicly denouncing
the TEAM Act, a bill to promote workplace cooperation.  Using
such rhetoric terming the bill &quot;classic Republican overkill,&quot;
 while renaming the measure the &quot;Employer Domination Act,&quot;
Gould left the arena of ideas and wholly joined the AFL-CIO propaganda
machine.
<P>
NLRB board members are judges.  The Labor Board is not supposed
to be the policy arm of the Clinton Administration, the Democratic
National Committee, nor the AFL-CIO. Gould has not only chosen
to embroil himself in a major legislative controversy, he's proven
himself an unabashed advocate of big labor rather than an impartial
judge of the law.
<P>
Just last month, as reported in <I>Labor Watch,</I> the Clinton
NLRB reversed long-standing law by giving unions the power to
shut down businesses in their effort to unionize separate companies.
 That case, involving a construction firm, established the new
rule of law that unions are free to strike, harass, and destroy
companies with which they have no bargaining relationship, so
long as the unions claim they are entitled to the type of work
in question; i.e., as part of a work preservation effort.
<P>
As Bill Gould showed last week, what John Sweeney and labor leaders
want from the NLRB, John Sweeney and the labor leaders get.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<a name="two"> </a>
<i><B>Proposed Legislation Strengthens Beck Decision
<BR>
</B></i>
<P>
Workers will have a right to know how labor leaders spend their
union dues under new legislation introduced by House Republicans.
 The Worker Right To Know Act, H.R. 3580, strengthens provisions
under the <I>Beck</I> decision, which allows workers to obtain
a rebate of the portion of their dues not related to collective
bargaining.
<P>
Key provisions under the Worker Right to Know Act:
<P>
<FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">-</FONT>Require unions to get annual
written authorization from each worker before accepting or demanding
payment of money  not spent for collective bargaining and contract
administration; i.e., for political purposes;
<P>
<FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">-</FONT> Establish an independent
auditor to determine the percentage of dues money that is spent
on collective bargaining or noncollective bargaining;
<P>
<FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">-</FONT> Prohibit unions from forcing
workers to join and pay dues as a condition of employment;
<P>
<FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">-</FONT> Allow workers to participate
in a union without paying the portion of dues that goes towards
non-collective bargaining activities; and
<P>
<FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">-</FONT> Require unions to report
annually to the Department of Labor on how dues money is spent.
<P>
AFL-CIO President, John J. Sweeney labeled the new bill as &quot;a
calculated effort to chill our exercise of First Amendment rights
to inform members and the public about attacks this Congress is
leading against working families.&quot;
<P>
In reality, the legislation simply gives workers more protections
and say over how their union dues is spent.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<a name="three"></a>
<B><i>The Little Theater that Could<BR>
</B></i>
<P>
A small, nonprofit children's theater in New York City could boast
of standing-room-only if not for the fact that the crowds have
been union pickets.  The New Victory Theater on 42nd Street has
been the target of big Broadway unions who are trying to muscle
their way on stage.
<P>
New Victor uses nonunion workers, which helps keep ticket prices
down.  The theater's practice has not received warm reviews from
the labor unions, including ushers, makeup artists, and press
agents.  They fear that potential new neighbor, Disney, will follow
New Victory's lead when they move in down the block.  In the meantime,
the show will go on, union pickets and all.<BR>
<P>

<i><B>New Labor Party Imports European Model for Economic
Disaster<BR>
</B></i>
<P>
As reported in the June 6 edition of <I>Labor Watch</I>, a new
American Labor Party met June 6 - 9 in Cleveland, Ohio.  The Labor
Party agreed to 16 principles that they would pursue as part of
their legislative and political agenda.  <I>Labor Watch</I> will
periodically list these principles <FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">,</FONT>
in this edition, we highlight Principle 6:
<P>
<CENTER>Less Work, More Money<BR>
</CENTER>
<P>
The Labor Party calls for amending the Fair Labor Standards Act
to:
<P>
<FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">-</FONT> A 32-hour, 4-day work week
(without loss of pay or benefits).
<P>
<FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">-</FONT> Provide a minimum of double-time
pay for all hours worked over 32 hours a week and 8 hours a day.
<P>
<FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">-</FONT> Forbid compulsory overtime.
<P>
<FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">-</FONT> An hour off with pay for
every 2 hours of overtime.
<P>
<FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">-</FONT> 20 mandatory paid vacation
days plus all federal holidays.
<P>
<FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">-</FONT> One year paid leave for every
7 years of work.
<P>
Together with the Labor Party's call for universal health care,
paid family leave, free child and elder care for all, and a constitutional
requirement that all Americans be guaranteed a job at (a minimum)
of $10 per hour adjusted for inflation <FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">,</FONT>
they claim these proposals will help create millions of new jobs.

<i><B>Taxpayer Outrage:  Union Officials' Salaries Paid with
</B></i>
<P><i>
<B>Medicare &amp; Social Security Trust Fund Dollars<BR>
</B></i>
<P>
And you thought labor unions were opposed to reforming  Social
Security and Medicare only because they cared about elderly Americans
being tossed onto the mean streets - hah!  The real reason has
recently emerged from scant media reports exposing blatant federal
subsidies to unions.
<P>
According to a June 6 editorial in the <I>Dallas Morning News</I>:
<P>
<I>The practice in question happens at the Social Security Administration.
 The federal agency pays the salaries of employees who work full
time or part time on labor union business.  It pays them from
the Social Security and Medicare trust funds, which most taxpayers
wrongly assume go exclusively to pay the retirements and health
care of U.S. workers.</I>
<P>
<I>It is all very legal.  Federal law requires it.  In fact, the
law also requires Social Security to provide office space and
administrative support services to its unions.</I>
<P>
According to the editorial, Social Security employees paid $4.8
million in union dues last year.  Still, taxpayers subsidize about
145 full-time and 1800 part-time union officials.  Under Clinton's
tenure (citing <I>Dallas Morning News </I>figures): <I>the amount
spent by Social Security on union business increased 83% to $11
million from 1993 to 1995...The number of employees who worked
full time as union representatives increased 81% during the same
period.</I>
<P>
Of course, the $4.8 million the unions collect in dues could easily
cover union officials' salaries <FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">,</FONT>
but why bother when the taxpayer is picking up the tab?
<P>
Recent studies show that Medicare will be bankrupt by 2001 and
Social Security by 2029.  And if unions keep pigging-out in their
share of trust fund money by beefing up both part time and full
time union staff, the trust funds will surely be empty sooner
than their anticipated bankruptcy in 2013.<BR>
<P>
<i><a name="two"></a>
<B>Irrational Labor Relations Board<BR>
</B></i>
<P>
Once again the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has been
slapped down by a federal appeals court for stacking the law against
employers.  The NLRB sought to force employers to hire union activists
who apply for positions that have  access to confidential and
sensitive labor relations information.
<P>
The Clinton NLRB required that an employer must produce objective
evidence showing that an applicant for a confidential job would
be disloyal to the employer.  Union membership or union activities
were not considered sufficient grounds.  The appeals court in
the Seventh Circuit rejected the NLRB position,  explaining that
the rule had &quot;no rational basis,&quot; that it &quot;is not
a <B>rational</B> construction of the Act,&quot; and &quot;requires
an employer to make an almost impossible showing.&quot;
<P>
The case was sent back to the Clinton appointees who no doubt
will make another stab at curtailing employer rights.<BR>
<P>

<B>Big Labor Getting On Democrat's Nerves <FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">,</FONT>
Columbus Mayor Seeks 'Management Rights'<BR>
</B></i>
<P>
The current Mayor of Columbus, Ohio <FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">,</FONT>
known throughout his six years in the state Senate as a liberal
Democrat <FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">,</FONT> has apparently
had it with Ohio's &quot;obstructionist&quot; collective bargaining
law.  Mayor Michael R. White detailed his frustrations with the
law in a May 20 letter to Senate President Stanley Aronoff, a
Republican from Cincinnati.
<P>
The letter, also sent to Governor George Voinovich, comes as White
has attempted to privatize some city operations, and improve city
services in an effort to save money.  According to the <I>Cleveland
Plain Dealer</I>, White asked the state legislature to change
the 13-year old law.  The letter      contends that the law permitting
government workers to organize &quot;has become a tool of unions&quot;
and has caused the &quot;emasculation of meaningful management
rights.&quot;  White also criticized the State Employment Relations
Board because the collective bargaining law had been distorted
by the board's rulings.
<P>
While conservatives are jubilant over their newfound ally in Mayor
White, union reaction has been bitter.  The head of the Cleveland
Police Patrolemen's Association said, &quot;The guy's got a lot
of nerve.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<i><a name="four"></a>
<B>A Kodak Moment We Wish We Had<BR>
</B></i>
<P>
Union summer &quot;Boot Camp&quot; unleashed the new generation
of union activists this week, and AFL-CIO President John Sweeney
took an active role in training sessions.
<P>
In Boston, Sweeney role-played a &quot;hostile employer&quot;
with the young activists in order to prepare them for the organizing
campaigns of hospital workers, city employees and laundry workers.
<BR>
<P>
<i><a name="five"></a>
<B>Union Rank-and-File vs. Labor Dictators<BR>
</B><i>
<P>
&quot;I've always been taught that unions are a brotherhood. 
To me this is more like the Mafia.  We are not supposed to come
out and use our own heads.  But this is not communism.  You don't
just vote for the party anymore.&quot;

<B>June 6, 1996<BR>
</B>
<P>
<a name="one"></a>
<i><B>An American Labor Party Will be Officially Launched
Early June<BR></i>
</B>
<P>
Some 1200 delegates representing local unions, central labor councils
and national unions will soon meet in Cleveland, Ohio to officially
announce the formation of an American labor party.  While the
name of the party has yet to be decided upon, its agenda and political
strategy has been well conceived.
<P>
The labor party will not endorse candidates (it believes the Democrat
Party has moved too far to the right) or run candidates for office
for several years, but it does intend to be a major political
force on issue advocacy and use the party to &quot;frame the nation's
political debate in terms of class <FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">,</FONT>
a broad working class against irresponsible, unacceptable corporate
power.&quot;  According to a May 27 article written for <I><B>In
These Times</B></I> (a twice-monthly left-leaning newspaper),
labor party advocates claim that its union supporters now number
over 1 million people <FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">,</FONT> or
6% of the labor movement.
<P>
According to the article, the labor party's statements of principle
include the following <FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">,</FONT> &quot;a
constitutional right to a job at a living wage; an income stability
fund to protect workers against job dislocation and downsizing
(see <I><B>Labor Watch</B></I> May 10, Issue 12 on New Jersey
proposal); free higher education for all; assurances of basic
social needs (single-payer health care, longer paid vacations,
affordable day care); and shorter work time.&quot;  The principles
also include union dominance in the workplace and &quot;just transition
to a non-polluting economic system and genuine equality of opportunity.&quot;
<P>
Interestingly, the party's chief organizers and advocates say
that they've made a major effort to &quot;minimize the influence
of small sectarian left groups.&quot;
<P>
Lastly, both labor party organizers and the AFL-CIO see their
goals as complimentary as the agenda of the new party is &quot;not
all that different&quot; from the unions.<BR>
<P>
<a name="two"></a>
<B><i>Going Postal<BR></i>
</B>
<P>
A new theory behind workplace violence was unveiled at the recent
meeting of the National Academy of Arbitrators <FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">,</FONT>
and all indications are that attendees may be in need of having
their heads examined.
<P>
Psychologists and unions now attribute incidents of employee violence
to failures in the workplace <FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">,</FONT>
<U>not</U> &quot;bad people,&quot; or &quot;crazy workers.&quot;
 For example, workplace factors that lead to violence can include
an employee reaction to unbearable workplace stress, such as downsizing
or the interaction with a person, or a situation.
<P>
While unions were quick to pin the blame of this serious issue
directly on human resource managers and employers, they were slow
to provide helpful solutions to the problem.  Unions denounced
the use of preventative measures, such as psychological profiles,
to help identify potentially violent employees.  According to
an official with the public-employee union American Federation
of State County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), lots of profiles
of violent employees &quot;sound like the profile of a good union
steward.&quot;<BR>
<P>
<a name="three"></a>
<i><B>Teaching Discord<BR>
</B></i>
<P>
At its 1995 convention, the National Education Association (NEA)
again defined itself as one of the leaders of the &quot;Big(ger)
Government Coalition.&quot;  Some of its resolutions include:
<P>
Endorsed single-payer Canadian-style health care;
<P>
Endorsed statehood for the District of Columbia;
<P>
Endorsed Gay and Lesbian History Month;
<P>
Denounced giving parents the right to choose their children's
schools;
<P>
Denounced home-schooling; and
<P>
Denounced a moment of silence in schools.
<P>
The NEA contributed $4.1 million in PAC funds to Democrats between
1993 and 1995.<BR>
<P>
<a name="four"></a><i>
<B> Stand for Clinton Rally Brings Out the Left<BR>
</B></i>
<P>
Unions weren't the only members of the radical fringe working
the crowd at last Saturday's Stand for Children rally.
<P>
Mike Golash stood near the rally stage hawking <U>Challenge</U>,
a publication of the Revolutionary Communist Progressive Labor
Party.  Its headline: &quot;CAPITALISM NO PLACE FOR KIDS.&quot;
<P>
According to a <I><B>Washington Post</B></I> report, Golash said,
&quot;What I hope to see is millions and millions of people warming
to the communist ideals <FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">,</FONT>
abolishing the wage system, ending racism and sexism, ending child
exploitation.  I see people realizing that we can take power through
revolution from the capitalists, and we can build a new society
based on production for equality, not production for profits.&quot;
<P>
The <I><B>Post</B></I> goes on to quote Golash as saying, &quot;Oh,
in the revolution, most of those people [conservatives] will be
destroyed.  They'll take up arms against us <FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">,</FONT>
there'll be a war, a civil war.  And they will be, you know, gotten
rid of, basically.&quot;<BR>
<P>
<a name="five"></a><i>
 <B>Minimum Wage Quote<BR>
</B></i>
<P>
&quot;I oppose not only an increase in the starting wage, but
a mandated starting wage period. It represents another death nail
in the coffin of the United States' free enterprise system.&quot;

<B><i>LIUNA Turns to Print Campaign to Clean-Up It's Image</i></B>
<P>
<B>Blames &quot;Right-Wingers&quot; for Its Trouble</B>
<P>
Feeling a little sensitive about being exposed for a rich history
of corruption and its ties to organized crime, the Laborers International
Union of North America (LIUNA) was compelled to purchase a full-page
ad in <I>The Washington Post</I> this week to &quot;answer its
critics.&quot;  Of course, LIUNA officials charged &quot;right-wing
extremists&quot; for their own internal troubles.
<P>
In a lengthy discourse (1849 words) the full-page ad reveals LIUNA's
own wrongdoings.  Boasting that LIUNA has implemented &quot;a
tough new Ethics and Disciplinary Code with zero tolerance for
any form of misconduct,&quot; the union is also proud of the fact
that it has hired, full-time, &quot;a former top official in the
Justice Department's Organized Crime Unit,&quot; and a former
top official in the investigative unit of the FBI.
<P>
The full-page ad, in essence, documents the massive irregularities
and corruption which has plagued the union for years.
<P>
The ad then proceeds to blame Republican leaders (&quot;Opponents
of Change&quot;) and &quot;Moronic Media Coverage&quot; for making
fraudulent charges against LIUNA.  These &quot;charges&quot; just
happen to be the details of the facts so competently described
in LIUNA's lengthy full-page ad.  While LIUNA wrote extensively
in the ad about their own problems and the corrective actions
they were taking to clean up the union, the only charges of &quot;Right-Wing
Mud-Throwing&quot; detailed in the ad were that House Speaker
Gingrich and Majority Leader Armey &quot;are dusting off all of
the old, discredited myths and buzzwords: big labor, out-of-touch,
union bosses.&quot;  LIUNA also takes aim at a recent <I>Reader's
Digest</I> article that chronicles the history of LIUNA and its
current leader, Arthur Coia.  LIUNA, in the ad, had nothing to
say about Coia's questionable ties to organized crime, and only
took aim at the details of the ongoing investigation of the union
by the federal government.
<P>
In effect, LIUNA took out the full-page ad to report that it has
been forced to take massive and unprecedented corrective measures
to clean up its operation, and is blaming &quot;right-wing extremists&quot;
for further reporting on and exposing its problems.  LIUNA boasts
of its clean-up efforts, but the question remains:  If LIUNA were
accountable to its members, and ran the union in an ethical and
legal manner, would the full-page ad been necessary in the first
place?
<P><a name="two"></a>
<B><i>Teachers Plan Fall Agenda</i></B>
<P>
<B>'96 Elections - Not the Classroom - Focus of Meeting</B>
<P>
The National Education Association (NEA) just completed a three-day
meeting with congressional contacts to devise a strategy for teachers'
unions in the fall elections.  The NEA and the American Federation
of Teachers (AFT) are the two main unions, with over three million
members.
<P>
According to <I>Investor's Business Daily</I>, a study of the
NEA's liberal legislative agenda shows that they and the American
Federation of Teachers are firmly established in the liberal tax-and-spend
pro-union Democrat camp.  In 1994, for example, Democrats got
99% of its PAC money, and 99% of the AFT's.  Passage of everything
on the NEA's spending &quot;wish list&quot; that year would have
cost taxpayers an extra $702 billion a year.  That shakes out
to $10,544 a year in additional taxes for a family of four.  In
addition, the NEA's plan would increase the size of government
by nearly 40%.  Of course, most of the issues on their list have
little or nothing to do with education.

<i><B>Rank-and-File vs. Sweeney:</i></B>
<P>
<B>AFL-CIO &quot;Officially&quot; Against MSAs Despite Popularity
Among Membership</B>
<P>
An official publication of the AFL-CIO, the <I>Trade Union Courier</I>,
is publicly on the record in support of Medical Savings Accounts
(MSAs), but the union's president, John Sweeney, has made it official
that the AFL-CIO will help Senator Ted Kennedy, and oppose MSAs
in health care reform legislation currently moving through Congress.
<P>
At the same time that America's &quot;Leading Labor Newspaper&quot;
is advocating that &quot;Congress should pass MSAs right now&quot;
(and as 50,000 United Mine Workers in West Virginia enjoy the
benefits of their negotiated MSAs), AFL-CIO chief Sweeney and
other union leaders who apparently don't heed the call of rank-and-file
members have stated the union's staunch opposition to MSAs.
<P>
The article entitled &quot;Who's Making Your Healthcare Choices?
MSAs let you do what is best for you,&quot; reveals that perhaps
labor leaders are not representing what's in the best interest
of the rank-and-file.  The article states:
<P>
<I>You've heard the MSA arguments; its rich versus poor, healthy
versus the sick, Democrats versus Republicans.  But who is speaking
for you?</I>
<P>
<I>Maybe no one; or worse maybe they are putting words in your
mouth.  You are not alone in thinking this is a good idea.  A
lot of rank and file members feel as you do.</I>
<P>
<I>. . . Let them (members of Congress) know that it should be
up to you to pick your own doctor, not some politician or HMO.</I>
<P>
<I>Let them know that you are wise enough to make the decisions
that are best for you.</I>
<P>
During the past several months, those favoring government control
of the health care system (like Ted Kennedy, and his friends on
the left like John Sweeney) have been fighting against the inclusion
of MSAs in health care reform.
<P>
The total disregard that Sweeney has displayed for his member's
views was recently uncovered in a poll conducted by Luntz Research
for Americans for a Balanced Budget.  The poll concluded that,
overwhelmingly, union members want a balanced budget, and tax
cuts (among other initiatives pursued by the Republican-led Congress)
which Sweeney is fighting <U>against</U> in Washington, and through
a multi-million dollar attack ad campaign funded by his members'
dues.  The rift over MSAs is just another example of Sweeney taking
liberties with his newfound power as chief of the AFL-CIO - putting
the name of the union behind efforts to kill legislation that
is contrary to the wishes and views of his membership, and aggressively
bankrolling media and political campaigns to reinforce Sweeney's
leftward views and desire to return the Congress back to Democrat
control.
<P>
The <I>Trade Union Courier</I> is published out of New York City.
Its circulation is the 1.4 million members of the AFL-CIO.

<blockquote>
<i><B>Another Clinton Payback: NLRB Decision Allows Disruption of
Construction Markets</B></i>
<P>
Late last week, the Clinton National Labor Relations Board (NLRB)
issued its most blatantly pro-union decision yet.  The NLRB ruled
that construction unions can demand, strike over, and enforce
so-called &quot;anti-dual shop&quot; clauses.  This decision could
force contractors to shut down nonunion subsidiaries, or impose
union membership on nonunion workers without a secret ballot vote.
<P>
The case arose over a decade ago when the Painters union sought
to block open shop (nonunion) encroachment into what it considered
union markets.  The same union that for years fought paint rollers,
spray painters and other labor-saving devices for its workers,
has tried to prevent union contractors from setting up &quot;dual
shop&quot; organizations.
<P>
Dual shops allow construction firms to operate both union and
open shop companies in order to compete in distinct markets for
construction services.  For example, government work, because
of the Davis-Bacon prevailing wage law, has become a special market
niche for union firms.  Residential and most commercial construction
work across the country today is built nonunion.  In order to
compete for government and private work, a parent firm must operate
separate and distinct subsidiaries.
<P>
The NLRB ruled that &quot;anti-dual shop&quot; contract terms
will be considered legal <U>despite</U> the prohibitions in the
statute against imposing contract terms on neutral employers.
 The immediate result of the decision will be the immediate demand
by construction unions that contractors shut down open shop subsidiaries.
 While business spends the next several years fighting such crippling
demands, the courts must sort out the NLRB's shaky reasoning.
 The outcome of the Clinton NLRB's gift to unions will be higher
construction costs, major business disruptions and lost opportunities
for workers.
<P><a name="two"></a>
<i><B>No Comment from Clinton on </B></i>
<P>
<B>&quot;Corporate Responsibility&quot; Proposals</B>
<P>
At the White House Conference on Corporate Responsibility on May
16, President Clinton stressed good &quot;corporate citizenship&quot;
but was mute on his support for proposals advocated by Labor Secretary
Reich and leading Democrats that give special tax breaks and regulatory
favors to businesses that institute government-preferred employee
programs.
<P>
Honoring businesses (mostly large) that provide an array of benefits
for their employees, the President also announced the creation
of the &quot;Ron Brown Corporate Citizenship Award.&quot; 
<P>
&quot;Corporate Responsibility&quot; proposals have been pushed
by the labor unions, Reich and key supporters in the Congress,
but the business community has been less enthusiastic about having
to adopt cookie-cutter employee benefits programs in order to
receive special tax breaks.  With the higher fixed labor costs
associated with such programs (as in the non job-producing economics
of Europe), such rigid programs will make it more difficult for
employers to hire new employees.  Interestingly, small businesses
(the job creating engines of the U.S. economy) were not featured
at the White House event.  According to Clinton, all of the very
financially healthy corporations featured at the event &quot;proves
you can do the right thing and make money&quot;  - but for many
small businesses, the Clinton tax increase and proposed minimum
wage hike won't even give small start-ups a chance.
<P><a name="three"></a>
<i><B>Greed Crosses Union Lines</B></i>
<P>
Some members of the AFL-CIO's Building and Construction Trades
Department (BCTD) feel that the Laborer's International Union
of North American (LIUNA) is overreaching its jurisdictional boundaries
in its zeal to add new members to its declining rolls.
<P>
In a recent meeting of the fifteen BCTD union bosses, the Bricklayers'
chief John Joyce called for a censure on Arthur Coia's LIUNA &quot;for
its predatory objectives and behavior.&quot;  In LIUNA's &quot;expansionist
program,&quot; organizing methods allegedly have included cash
bribes and job offers to lure over representatives of other unions,
as well as negotiating to include the definition of other crafts
in their own collective bargaining agreements.  Joyce claims the
Plasterer's Union has had problems with LIUNA's encroachment on
their territory, and feels his bricklayers will be next.
<P>
Although members of the construction unions have for years bickered
and battled over jurisdictional issues, Joyce stated that the
censure was proposed because LIUNA &quot;has exhausted everyone's
patience.&quot;  But Joyce may have another motive in taking such
a hard line against LIUNA.  Coia supported the opponent of Joyce
ally, Robert Georgine, in the last BCTD presidential election.
<P>
Instead of censure, the BCTD gave LIUNA 30 days to resolve its
problems and make peace with the other unions to demonstrate solidarity.
<P><a name="four"></a>
<i><B>But Another Controversial Payback Struck Down Again by the
Courts</B></i>
<P>
Last week, the full court of appeals in Washington, D.C. refused
to cooperate in President Clinton's effort to tilt the balance
of power in labor's favor.  By a 9 to 2 vote the court rejected
the Administration's request for a rehearing of the decision to
invalidate the Clinton Striker Replacement Executive Order. 
<P>
That order would have prohibited federal contractors from hiring
permanent replacements during strikes and other labor disputes.
 If it had stood, a large group of employers would have been defenseless
against exorbitant demands by unions.  In February, however, a
panel of the D.C. Court of Appeals struck down the Executive Order
because it conflicted with clear, longstanding labor law principles.
<P>
The full court decision issued last week left no doubt that the
rule of law is superior to the President's wishes to pander to
unions. Terming the Administration's arguments &quot;far-fetched&quot;
and &quot;silly,&quot; the court refused to reconsider the earlier
decision of the three-judge panel.  The case in now likely to
go to the U.S. Supreme Court.
<P><a name="five"></a>
<i> <B>Starting Wage Fact</B></i>
<P>
Within one year, more than 60% of workers earning the minimum
wage will receive a raise of at least 20%.  This is as much as
the Clinton Administration's proposal but without the job loss.

<blockquote>
<i><B>Unions Follow Corporate America's Lead</B></i>
<P>
Consolidation.  Efficiency.  Layoffs.  These facts of corporate
life have come to the union movement.  The Laborers Union has
ordered the consolidation of 10 of its locals in New York City.
 Emulating the best in the corporate public relations field, the
union spokesman announced:  &quot;We realize that this will cost
some local union officers their jobs, but...members were paying
too much for the services they were receiving.&quot;
<P>
The union's restructuring was a matter of survival, but not from
the forces of competition like businesses face.  The District
Council of the union has been operating under a Trusteeship since
settlement of a Labor and Justice Department lawsuit in 1994 alleging
corruption.  The New York reorganization was required because
an investigation found that the structure was &quot;organizationally
and financially inefficient.&quot;  More damning, the union setup
provided &quot;unacceptable opportunities for organized crime
to corrupt the internal operation of the locals.&quot;
<P>
<a name="two"></a><i><B>Union Sued By Workers - Broke &quot;Job Security Vow&quot;</B></i>
<P>
According to an article from the Institute for Global Communications
(a labor internet news group), forty laid-off workers from the
Bath Iron Works Corp. are suing the Industrial Union of Marine
and Shipbuilding Workers of America.  The workers are suing on
the grounds that the union assured them of continuous employment
through 1997.
<P>
The union's lawyers claim that the workers should be suing the
company, not the union.  But according to one worker, who is now
on  welfare and trying to feed his family of four on $242 per
week, a union rep. was present at each worker interview stating
that &quot;everything would be ok.&quot;
<P>
The workers are seeking damages for lost wages, emotional distress,
and want to be reimbursed for union dues collected during their
employment.
<P><a name="three"></a>
<i><B>NLRB Advocacy Put on Hold...For Now</B></i>
<P>
The Congress passed, and the President has signed, a significant
provision curbing an abuse of power by the National Labor Relations
Board (NLRB).  As part of the 1996 spending bill enacted recently,
the Labor Board cannot spend any money to finalize its infamous
&quot;single location bargaining unit&quot; rule.
<P>
That rule has been roundly criticized by small business owners
as a blank check for union organizers to more easily organize
retail shops, restaurants and other businesses across the country.
<P>
According to a recent article by Bloomberg Business News, it is
estimated that a unionization effort at a small business would
cost the business as much as $100,000 to hire a lawyer and labor
negotiator.
<P>
The recently enacted ban remains in effect through this fiscal
year, September 30, and NLRB officials have said no final action
would be taken until Fall.
<P><a name="four"></a>
<i><B>New Jersey and You - Downsizing Together</B></i>
<P>
A New Jersey union is launching a grassroots campaign to support
proposed legislation that would financially punish businesses
that downsize.  &quot;The Job Destruction Penalty Act&quot; was
introduced in the New Jersey Assembly on May 2.   It would require
companies of 100 or more employees to give 2 months of severance
pay (for each year of service) to permanently laid-off workers.
 In addition, a fine of $4,000 per employee, per lay-off would
be levied against the company, and (in theory) would be given
 back to the community to help off-set the job and tax revenue
loss.  The New Jersey Industrial Union Council is leading the
grass- roots mobilization efforts.

<i><B>Clinton Asks Americans to Celebrate Labor's Rich Heritage</B></i>
<P>
On May 3, President Clinton proclaimed May 1996 &quot;Labor History
Month.&quot;  The President calls on all Americans to &quot;observe
this month with ceremonies, activities, and programs that encourage
reflection on the labor movement's heritage and its many contributions
to the creation and maintenance of a just America.&quot;
<P>
In his proclamation he extolled the virtues of unions and declared
that &quot;Each new generation of workers must embrace the activism
that has characterized labor's rich history...&quot;
<P>
Indeed, Americans will find a rich history, but unfortunately
the highlights of the labor movement are equally matched with
&quot;lowlights,&quot; including corruption, extortion and scandal.
 Of course, none of this is mentioned in the President's official
proclamation.
<P>
Could you imagine if &quot;each new generation&quot; embraced
AFL-CIO V.P.  Richard Trumka's  techniques?  <I>Labor Watch </I>readers
remember Trumka's kind remarks to those who don't see things his
way: &quot;...we'll knock you flat on your --.&quot;  
<P>
Traffice terrorism, hostile and unethical corporate campaigns,
violent strikes, bomb threats, and labor leader corruption are
other items looked over by the Clinton proclamation.
<P><a name="six"></a>
<i><B>White House to Sponsor Conference on</B></i>
<P>
<B>&quot;Corporate Responsibility&quot;</B>
<P>
On May 16, the White House will bring in its choice of the country's
&quot;best companies&quot; and sponsor a conference on good corporate
citizenship.  The CEOs that received the White House seal of approval
will breakfast with the President and participate in panel discussions
at Georgetown University.  Topics to be discussed will probably
include:  Family-Friendly Workplaces, Economic Security, Investment
in Employees, Partnership with Employees, and Safe &amp; Secure
Workplaces.
<P>
According to a copy of &quot;The President's Corporate Citizenship
Challenges&quot; distributed on March 23, ways that companies
can best help employees (in the above-mentioned areas) is by getting
them involved in the workplace, and by giving them a voice.  
<P>
Union organizing, as a way to help employees, is not mentioned.
 In fact, Clinton's &quot;Challenges&quot; sound very much like
the TEAM Act, legislation passed by the House and being pursued
by Sen Dole along with the minimum wage hike.  The unions strongly
oppose the TEAM Act.
<P><a name="seven"></a>
<i><B> Starting Wage Fact:</B></i>
<P>
<B>According to the National Governor's Association, a $1 increase
in the starting wage amounts to the largest unfunded mandate imposed
by the GOP-lead Congress</B>.

</blockquote>
<P>
These were just two of the quotes that Luntz Research received
in a recent survey of union members to gauge rank-and-file sentiment
regarding big labor's heavy investment in congressional races.
 The unions are targeting Republican members in order to help
return the Congress to Democratic hands.  Over 1,000 union members
were surveyed for Americans for a Balanced Budget from April 23
- 28.
<P>
Key findings include:
<P>
<ul>
<li>By an overwhelming 84% to 9% margin, union members want to force
their leaders to explain what happens to their dues, where the
money is spent and why.
<P>
<li>Campaigns and politics <U>are</U> <U>not</U> the priorities of
the rank-and-file - only 4% said engaging in political election
activities were important.  Preserving jobs came out on top at
58%; increasing wages and benefits was second at 27%; and improving
the image of unions was third at 8%.
<P>
<li>Who is John Sweeney?  The rank-and-file membership would like
to know too.  Only 18% knew of him well enough to offer an opinion
of him.  82% had no opinion or knowledge of him.
<P>
<li>Rank-and-file members are not aware that they have a right to
get a refund for dues spent on political activities, despite union
leaders comments to the contrary.  Only 19% knew of this right.
 More strikingly, one-fourth of those belonging to a union for
two or more decades know about their right to a refund. Needless
to say, the union leadership has not publicized the issue with
its rank-and-file.
<P>
<li>Union members reaction was hostile to the fact that $35 million
dollars of their dues is being used to defeat Congressional Republicans.
 Overall, 41% are &quot;strongly opposed&quot; to the effort while
21% &quot;somewhat oppose&quot; it.  Of those supporting the campaign,
15% &quot;strongly support&quot; it, while 16% &quot;somewhat
support&quot; the effort.
</ul>
<P>
On specific issues, the rank-and-file membership appear to be
more in line with Republican-led initiatives. In fact, the union
leadership has pumped millions of dollars into lobbying and media
campaigns that run counter to the wishes of their membership.
<p>
For example:
<P>
<ul>
<li>By an 82% to 11% margin, union members support the Balanced Budget
Amendment.
<P>
<li>Welfare reform  that requires recipients to work is supported
by union members by 87% to 7%.
<P>
<li>The $500 tax credit pushed by the GOP is supported by 78% of those
surveyed.
</ul>
<P><a name="two"></a>
<i><B>Union Boss Lashes Out at Government Bureaucrats</B></i>
<P>
Sounding like an outraged small business owner, Bricklayers Union
boss John T. Joyce recently complained, &quot;If the [Labor Department]
is going to keep coming up with new technicalities and making
decisions on the flip of a coin, it is futile to try to do it
the right way.&quot;  The reason for Joyce's outburst: A DOL lawsuit
challenging his reelection for a fourth five-year term as international
union president.
<P>
The lawsuit, seeking to rerun the election, alleges widespread
use of union funds for payment of campaign personnel, improper
electioneering, and use of union equipment and resources by the
Joyce campaign.  Joyce defeated challenger Gerald Carlisle by
1,995 votes out of 88,235 votes cast.
<P>
&quot;This is precisely the senseless misuse of bureaucratic power
that erodes public confidence in the federal regulatory process,&quot;
Joyce laments.  &quot;In the case at hand, DOL understands neither
the law they administer nor the organizations they regulate.&quot;
<p>
At last - we agree on something.
<P><a name="three"></a>
<i><B>Kennedy and Labor Bosses Fighting Against Tax Free MSAs</B></i>
<P>
Labor leaders have joined the chorus of those condemning medical
savings accounts (MSAs).  In the weekly edition of <I>Work in
Progress</I>, an AFL-CIO publication, MSAs are described as &quot;controversial&quot;
calling them tax breaks for the healthy and wealthy.  
<P>
As confirmed by the Luntz survey, labor leaders seem to be out
of touch with their rank-and-file membership.  This certainly
proves to be the case with  MSAs.  Case in point: the United Mine
Workers of West Virginia bargained to get a MSA prototype in their
contracts.  According to the <I>Courier-Journal</I> of Louisville,
Kentucky, &quot;Each contract year, the company gives members
$1,000 for out-of-pocket health care costs; $1,000 is the deductible.
 Members not using the money for health care can keep it.&quot;
 Sounds like a MSA to <I>Labor Watch</I> staff.
<P>
Labor's &quot;hero&quot; Ted Kennedy is of course fighting against
MSAs - he prefers that the mine workers be taxed unfairly for
their health care benefits rather than giving them tax parity
with big corporations.
<P><a name="four"></a>
<i><B>Sweeney Youth Unleashed</B></i>
<P>
<i><B> &quot;Union Summer&quot; Campaign Begins June 1</B></i>
<P>
Political activism, union organizing and garden variety militancy
are the activities of AFL-CIO boss John Sweeney's summer internship
program.  Enlisting up to 1,000 young people from across the country,
Sweeney vows to put them to work &quot;planning, phone calling,
door knocking, organizing, and demonstrating.&quot;
<P>
At a press conference and barbecue on May 1, the union chief identified
the corporate campaign against the Detroit Newspapers as well
as Service Workers Union organizing drives as two of the projects
to which the interns will be assigned.  Sweeney also acknowledged
that the political activists will be put to work on grassroots
minimum wage fights at the state and local level, and agitating
against the California Civil Rights Institute.
<P>
Sweeney Youth will be deployed to cities across the United States
for three-week stints. The activists will receive training, free
housing, and a stipend of $210 per week.
<P>
(For a list of cities the interns will be sent to, contact SBS
Foundation at 202-785-0238.)

<i><B>AFL-CIO Grades It's Congressional Targets</B></i>
<P>
The  latest propoganda from an AFL-CIO mail campaign was given
to <I>Labor Watch</I> staff.  The mailing, a &quot;report card,&quot;
targeted 33 House members who received mostly &quot;Fs&quot; from
the union -  31 of the targets were Republicans, and 2 were Democrats.
 At first glance, the direct mail campaign appeared &quot;bi-partisan&quot;
- until it was discovered by <I>Labor Watch</I> staff that the
2 Democrats are leaving Congress.
<P><a name="two"></a>
<I><B>Another Payback</B></I><B>: Clinton's Latest Agent for Unions</B>
<P>
Add the Security &amp; Exchange Commission (SEC) to the list of
federal agencies dedicated to boosting the union agenda.  This
winter, the SEC ordered the Dupont Company to include in its proxy
statement, a proposal by its union to dedicate a seat on the board
of directors for a union member.
<P>
The company had opposed the election of a director that &quot;represents
a particular point of view or particular constituency other than
shareholders as a whole,&quot; reports the <U>Daily Labor Report</U>.
 The SEC ignored the management view and ordered inclusion of
the proposal that was drafted by the Independent Brotherhood of
Dupont Workers.
<P><a name="three"></a>
<i><B>Employers Are Fighting Back:</B></i>
<P>
<B>Field Hearings Focus on &quot;Salting&quot; as a Corporate
Campaign Technique</B>
<P>
Some of unions' most abusive campaign tactics came under fire
April 12 as contractors and their employees took their cases to
a congressional field hearing in Kansas City.  At issue was the
union scheme of &quot;salting&quot; - work sites with union organizers
who file discrimination charges with the National Labor Relations
Board (NLRB), disrupt work, and run-up employer costs.  Union
manipulation of the law and NLRB complicity were the primary themes.
<P>
Gregory E. Hoberock's testimony was typical:  &quot;Forcing employers
to hire persons whose intent is to bankrupt the employer does
not make sense.&quot;  His family-owned business in Union, Missouri,
suffered dozens of frivolous charges filed with the NLRB at a
cost of $15,000 to $25,000 in legal fees.
<P>
The hearing was called by Rep. Harris Fawell (R-IL), Chair of
the House Opportunities Committee Employer-Employee Relations
Subcommittee, and Small Business Committee Chair Jan Meyers (R-KS).
 Rep. Fawell has introduced, H.R. 3211, the &quot;Truth in Employment
Act,&quot; addressing the problem of salting.  As he stated at
the hearing, H.R. 3211 &quot;merely seeks to alleviate the legal
pressure imposed upon employers to hire individuals whose overriding
purpose for seeking the job is not to become a bona fide employee,
but to organize the employer's workplace and/or otherwise inflict
economic harm on the employer.&quot;
<P>
The criticism of salting was not limited to business owners. 
Electrician Richard Oberlechner complained, &quot;We are tired
of the harassment tactics [by unions], both on a company basis
and against us individually.&quot; Echoing the concerns of many,
he stressed, &quot;We do not want our future jeopardized for the
monetary gains of others.&quot;
<P>
The message to Congress was compelling.  &quot;Right now it is
David facing not one, but two Goliaths...the unions with their
large coffers and the NLRB,&quot; said David Meyer of Meyer Brothers
Building Co., a Blue Springs, Missouri general contractor employing
50 workers.  He concluded, &quot;Small businesses are the backbone
of our country.  Please do not stand by and watch the small businesses
and our FREE ENTERPRISE system be destroyed by the unions and
a tax-supported branch of our government.&quot;
<P><a name="four"></a>
<i><B>As John Sweeney Sees It </B>- </i>
<P>
<B>Labor <I>Can't</I> Do It On It's Own</B>
<P>
&quot;We're in the battle of our life,&quot; declares AFL-CIO
President John J. Sweeney.  &quot;If we don't change this Congress,
believe me, we've only seen a taste of what their agenda will
be.&quot;
<P>
With this rallying cry, Sweeney told a conference of the New York
State Labor-Religion Coalition that the key to labor's strategy
for the future is building coalitions with religious, environmental
and other groups.  Also key, according to Sweeney, is electing
a Democratic Congress.
<P><a name="five"></a>
<i><B>Minimum Wage Madness</B></i>
<P>
Maybe Republican members of Congress supporting a $1.00 increase
in the minimum wage need to contact the Democratic Leadership
Council (DLC) to get a primer on why the wage hike is bad for
business and bad for workers.  
<P>
According to the DLC, the &quot;moderate&quot; Democratic institution
once led by President Clinton, the wage hike is &quot;counterproductive,
raising prices for poor people while helping mainly middle class
families.&quot;  The hike would also &quot;reduce job creation
 for low- skilled people.&quot;
<P>
The DLC continues, &quot;Increasing the minimum wage would produce
a regressive transfer, making most poor people a little worse
off in order to improve the lives, at least for a time, of a group
of people which is predominately non-poor.&quot;
<P><a name="six"></a>
 <i><B>Starting Wage Fact</B>:</i>
<P>
The 90-cent starting wage hike will directly cost business $12.3
billion over the next 5 years according to the CBO.

<blockquote>
<i><B>Another Clinton Payback Owed</i> - Clinton Coordinated Closely
With </B>
<P>
<b>Unions During Government Shutdown</b><P>
Led by the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE),
the unions helped President Clinton develop his confrontational
strategy with Republicans over the budget, and were informed that
the shutdown, as well as a delay in increasing government's borrowing
authority, would not adversely impact government operations and
 social security,  or  other transfer payments.  At the same time,
the Treasury Dept. was telling the public exactly the opposite.
 According to an April 1, <I><B>Washington Times</B></I> story,
the AFGE did not tell members about Treasury's use of retirement
funds.  Instead it sent weekly alerts to its members warning about
the default's &quot;danger.&quot;
<P><a name="two"></a>
<i><B>The Reich Report: Mixed Messages</B></i>
<P>
Is the U.S. economy creating high-wage or dead-end jobs?  The
answer depends on what soil Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich is
standing.
<P>
In France earlier this month, Reich defended the 8.4 million jobs
that have been created while the Clinton Administration has been
in office.  Apparently, Europeans are under the impression that
these are low-skilled and low-wage jobs.  He and the Administration
boasted that &quot;the fastest growing job categories in the U.S.
are the highest paying ones...60 percent of those new jobs are
high-wage positions in areas such as finance, telecommunications,
and other high-tech areas.&quot;
<P>
At home, Reich follows the union cue and bemoans the &quot;anxious
class&quot; fearful of dead-end jobs.  The Labor Secretary's friends
at the AFL-CIO dictate a similar message.  A union resolution
declares:  &quot;Loaded with debt... threatened with downsizing
and outsourcing, and a growing pool of low-wage, no-benefit contingent
labor, American workers are frustrated, anxious and angry.&quot;
 
<P>
Except for some unwarranted credit taking, Reich was on the ball
while in France.  The next time he speaks on the issue in the
U.S., employers hope he speaks as glowingly about American jobs
as he does overseas.
<P><a name="three"></a>
<i><B>The Corporate Campaign: USA Today, Now More Than Ever</B></i>
<P>
It's official, reading<I><B> USA Today</B></I> is now politically
incorrect.  Top union boss John Sweeney has ordered unionists
not to buy or advertise in the national newspaper because its
owner, Gannett Publishing, has refused to yield to union demands
in Detroit.  A similar &quot;Do Not Buy&quot; order went out against
<I><B>The Miami Herald</B></I>, the flagship paper of Knight-Ridder.
<P>
The much publicized union strike against the<I><B> Detroit Free
Press</B></I> and <I><B>Detroit News</B></I> is going into its
ninth month.  Undaunted by formal complaints by the government
and by legal action arising out of the strikers' campaign of violence,
the union hopes to broaden public awareness of their dispute.
 As AFL-CIO leader Richard Trumka vowed last month, &quot;We will
be moving on a rather nationwide basis to expose what Gannett
is doing to workers in Detroit.&quot;
<P>
The unions have recently gone into competition with the Detroit
papers by publishing their own &quot;Sunday Journal&quot; for
which they are soliciting advertisers.  No doubt the real Detroit
newspapers are not worried about the new weekly.  With union work
rules, featherbedding, and grievance procedures, it is highly
unlikely that the strikers' &quot;Sunday Journal&quot; will turn
a profit in this lifetime.
<P><a name="four"></a>
<i><B>Labor Chat - Spiked AFL-CIO Survey From '94 Resurfaces on the
Internet</B></i>
<P>
According to a 1994 posting on Labor Talk, an on-line newsgroup
through the Institute for Global Communications, a '94 survey
commissioned by the AFL-CIO was too embarrassing to share with
the public - or its own members for that matter.
<P>
The survey, &quot;Being Heard,&quot; included these findings:
<P>
<ul>
<li>Of the 4 out of 5 Americans living in non-union households,
only 29% have positive feelings about unions, 39% negative, and
32% neutral.
<P>
<li> Only 25% feel that unions are concerned about all working
people - 65% say that unions are concerned only about their members.
</ul>
<P>
The authors of the report, a pro-labor consulting firm, also concluded
that the unions were perceived as &quot;undemocratic institutions,&quot;
increasingly irrelevant, and &quot;outdated, old-fashioned, hidebound
guardians of the status quo.&quot;  According to the Labor Talk
article, the report was published on March 21, 1994.
<P><a name="five"></a>
<i><B>Union Money Making &quot;Fad&quot;</B></i>
<P>
Like a sponge to water, organized labor has taken to soaking money
from the U.S. Treasury.  According to the Federal Assistance Awards
Data System (FAADS), unions receive over $39 million per year
in grants through not-for-profit organizations, and the U.S. Department
of Labor.  The following unions and their affiliates were some
of the recipients during 1993-1994:
<P><pre>
AFL-CIO    				$2,038,000
<P>
AFSME       				$148,000
<P>
American Fed of Teachers     		$143,000
<P>
American Nurses Assoc.        		$965,000
<P>
Int'l Assoc of Machinists  		$1,770,000
<P>
National Education Assoc.       	$385,000
<P>
Teamsters       			$3,542,000
<P>
Service Employees Int'l Union		$137,000
<P>
United Auto Workers            		$805,000
<P>

<blockquote>
<i><B>Pressure from the Pressmen</B></i>
<P>
The Clinton National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has shown its
prounion colors, judging from a recent Court of Appeals decision.
 It appears that the union-packed NLRB has forgotten the violence
that marked the 1985 strike against the <I>Chicago Tribune</I>
stirred by the hiring of replacement workers.  The strike ended
in 1986, and by May, 1989 the process of reinstating striking
workers was well on the way.  The Pressman's union has since been
seeking the names and the addresses of replacement workers who
are still employed at the <I>Tribune.</I>
<P>
The NLRB ordered the <I>Tribune</I> to furnish the names and addresses
of replacement employees to the union on the basis that the &quot;passage
of five years since the violence tilted the balance in favor of
disclosure.&quot;   A ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the Seventh Circuit has however, refused to enforce the NLRB order.
 Violence against replacement workers during the strike included
tire slashing, death threats, as well as the stabbing of a delivery
driver. 
<P>
The <I>Tribune</I> offered to conduct a third party mailing to
the replacement workers, would permit communications during nonwork
times, the posting of union notices on company bulletin boards
and allow distribution of union notices in nonwork areas.  Replacement
employees could also choose to provide the union with their own
address.  This was not good enough though for the union or its
supporters on the Labor Board. The federal court disagreed with
both the NLRB and the union to ensure employee protections.
<P><a name="two"></a>
<i><B>Whose Rights Are They Anyway? </B></i>
<P>
Employees have the right to object to union political activities,
but it is illegal for employers to tell them so.  That is the
argument behind a complaint filed by the General Counsel of the
Labor Board against nursing home operator Beverly Enterprises.
<P>
The company has been cited for breaking labor laws by notifying
employees of their rights under the Supreme Court's <U>Beck</U>
decision.  That case recognized the right to object to paying
the portion of compulsory union dues which is spent on political
causes opposed by the employee.
<P>
The Clinton NLRB recently ruled that unions are not required by
law to give their members effective notice of their <U>Beck</U>
rights.  If the Labor Board is successful in its case against
Beverly, employers will be prohibited from letting their employees
in on this secret.  That leaves to Clinton appointees the task
of spreading the word about rights the unions oppose.
<P><a name="three"></a>
<i><B>No Minority Rights</B></i>
<P>
Like all democratic institutions, union bosses are supposed to
represent the views of their constituents - the dues paying members.
 So if a large share of union members vote Republican, the elected
union officials pay heed, right?
<P>
You be the judge.  A recent Communications Workers of America
(CWA) union poll showed that its members favored President Clinton
over Bob Dole by 53% to 27%.  The union's executive council unanimously
endorsed the Clinton-Gore ticket.  CWA President Mort Bahr says
&quot;our jobs is to make sure the 53% [favoring Clinton] stays.&quot;
 Bahr is also reported to have charged his members to work for
the election of  Democrats to the U.S. House in an effort to recapture
the chamber.
<P><a name="four"></a>
<i><B>Attention Blue Light Shoppers -</B></i>
<br>
<B>Campaign Targets K-mart</B>
<P>
One of America's retail giants is experiencing a text book corporate
campaign.  The target: Kmart.  Unions are working every angle
to convert productive employees of the company into dues paying
members so they can attack every level of the company's operations.
<P>
The International Brotherhood of Teamsters and Union of Needletrades
Industrial and Textile Employees (UNITE) are seeking employee
representation on the company's board of directors.  They are
also pressing for annual board elections for all directors and
the elimination of retirement plans for nonemployee directors.
 The unions believe that their representation on the board will
also improve Kmart's stock value. 
<P>
The Teamsters represent a small percentage of Kmart employees
and own 500,000 shares of the company's stock.  UNITE is currently
seeking to organize over 500 Kmart employees in Greensboro, NC.
 Last fall, the union made allegations of discriminatory employment
practices and instituted a consumer boycott - standard tactics
in corporate campaigns.
<P>
The unions are backing Stephen Hester for Kmart's board.  Hester's
speciality is  employee stock ownership programs, and he is credited
with helping unionized employees of Northwest Airlines gain stock
ownership and representation on its board of directors.
<P>
The Teamsters and UNITE blame the lack of  an  independent voice
on the board of directors for the decline in Kmart's stock value.
 They see Kmart competitor, Wal-Mart, gaining  a significant share
of the market.  No doubt when the unions decide to take on non-union
Wal-Mart, they will  conclude that Wal-Mart's competitive edge
could vastly improve with union representation.

<B>Sweeney Youth to be Trained for &quot;Union Summer&quot;</B>
<P>
AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney wants to train members of the
MTV generation to be union activists.  Desperate for new dues-paying
members, he has devised a plan to recruit the children of existing
members - and other young people - into service this summer. 
Participants will promote the joys of union membership under the
guise of social justice.
<P>
The three-month boot camp, called &quot;Union Summer,&quot; will
immerse young recruits in union rhetoric, teach the the principles
of union activism and put them to work on organizing campaigns
and union projects around the country.
<P>
In a recruitment flyer for &quot;Union Summer,&quot; the AFL-CIO
asks prospects to &quot;join hundreds of workers and students
making history.  Spend three weeks in the streets and neighborhoods,
organizing for workplace rights and social justice.  Make this
a summer America will never forget!&quot;
<P>
&quot;Union Summer&quot; applications are currently being accepted.
 Applicants are asked to &quot;describe a defining moment or life
experience that relates to your desire to fight injustice.&quot;
<P><a name="two"></a>
<B>New Clinton Payback Revealed</B>
<P>
In a recent address before the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, House
Republican Conference Chairman, John Boehner (R-OH) revealed President
Clinton's latest payback to organized labor.  According to Boehner,
just two weeks before receiving big labor's endorsement, Bill
Clinton &quot;instructed the government's personnel office to
proved labor unions with the home addresses of all federal employees
in bargaining units - whether or not they are union members.&quot;
<P>
<I><B>Labor Watch</B></I> pondered the potential uses of this
data:  re-elect Clinton campaign, political literature, mailings
of related union propaganda, and personal visits to the homes
of nonmembers.
<P><a name="three"></a>
<B>Cookie Monsters: Tales from the Corporate Campaign Front</B>
<P>
The St. Louis Girl Scouts are the latest target of a union corporate
campaign.  Members of an electrical workers union local have threatened
a boycott, and are picketing two Girl Scout camps in Eastern Missouri
after a nonunion electrical contractor was awarded the work for
major renovations and construction at the camps.
<P>
Building and Construction Trades Council officials have warned
the area executive director of the detrimental impact upon her
organization over its failure to use union contractors.  She agreed
to try to change the decision.  The pickets remain camped out
while awaiting the final outcome, and plans to put the Girl Scouts
on the unions' &quot;We Do Not Patronize&quot; list were put on
hold.
<P>
The question remains as to whether union officials will issue
the ultimate boycott - a refusal to buy Girl Scout cookies.
<P><a name="four"></a>
<B>Union Backing</B>
<P>
A kindler, gentler union movement?  You decide.  Richard Trumka,
AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer, recently whipped the Pennsylvania
union conventioneers into a frenzy with this rallying cry:  &quot;Our
message is that unions are back.  Get in our way and we'll knock
you flat on your (expletive).&quot;
<P><a name="five"></a>
<B>&quot;Government Stewardship&quot; of Unions  Lousy Says Union
Members</B>
<P>
Even Teamsters complain that government can't run anything right.
 In response to petitions from 12,000 rank-and-file members of
the union, two Members of Congress are seeking a review of the
effectiveness of the Independent Review Board (IRB), which oversees
the operation of the nation's largest labor organization.
<P>
In a consent decree with the Justice Department, the IRB was formed
in 1989 to root out organized crime within the Teamsters and monitor
its financial affairs.  Reps. Michael Flanagan (R-IL) and William
Lipinski (D-IL) report that union members &quot;contend the union's
financial condition has worsened in its years under government
stewardship&quot; and have called for an investigation.
<P><a name="six"></a>
<B>Rights on the Left</B>
<P>
Some Rights are more right than others, in the union mindset.
 Beating the union drum at the March 25 AFL-CIO convention in
Washington, Vice President Gore blasted Republicans and demonstrated
the Administration's affinity with Big Labor as he declared: &quot;To
them, the right to strike is a luxury...but to us the right to
strike is a right.&quot;
<P>
The right to work, on the other hand, is considered an unsavory
concept by the AFL-CIO.  National Right to Work is high on their
hit list of proposed legislation in these days of frantic efforts
to shore up dwindling union rolls.  If workers could no longer
be forced to join unions in order to keep their jobs, the decline
in union membership might just go into freefall.

<i><B>Another Clinton Payback - &quot;Prevailing Waste&quot;</B></i>

<P>
&quot;We were caught abetting fraud and incompetence, so give
us more money.&quot; That is the unmistakable message from the
Labor Department as it tries to explain a request to spend $3.75
million more to administer the Davis-Bacon Act.
<P>
Last year the Department of Labor stonewalled every effort to
expose fraud in the calculation of &quot;prevailing wages&quot;
which federal government contractors must pay under the Davis-Bacon
Act. Until pressure came to bear, the Department refused to provide
access to public documents or even to disclose the names of union
officials who submitted bogus data - data which the DOL says it
relies on to calculate wages. Without the dogged determination
of Oklahoma Commissioner of Labor, Brenda Reneau, who uncovered
the fraud, and the outrage of Reps. Cass Ballenger (R-NC) and
Pete Hoekstra (R-MI), the federal Department would have denied
any problems existed.
<P>
In an investigation by Reneau and her staff, it was found that
&quot;certain parties&quot; submitted bogus projects to the DOL
including inflated wage rates of ghost employees.
<P>
This week the DOL admits in the Clinton Budget that &quot;the
current [wage determination] system's reliance on the 'third party'
data submissions has recently exposed the vulnerability to manipulation
through submission of false or selective data, and raises serious
questions about the accuracy of some of the wage determinations
that are issued.&quot;
<P>
The Labor Department's answer to those questions: Pour about $4
million more into the black hole of Davis-Bacon. In the near future
ABC t.v. program<I> 20/20</I> will air a special report on Davis-Bacon.
Investigative reporter, John Stossel produced the segment.
<P><a name="two"></a>
<i><B>BIG LABOR'S REAL AGENDA: </i>
<br>Clinton Appointee Fired for
Aiding a Corporate Campaign - Big Labor-Big Government Incestuous
Relationship Exposed</B> 
<P>
A top Department of Labor (DOL) appointee has been forced from
office because of his efforts to abet a union's corporate campaign.
Richard Sawyer, Labor Secretary Reich's chief representative in
the West, lost his job March 8 for contacting Hewlett-Packard
Co - threatening the company that the DOL would seize its products
- because its janitorial service, (which the Service Employees
union are attempting to organize) was &quot;going to get caught
doing bad things eventually.&quot; Mr. Sawyer is a former Service
Employees International Union (SEIU) local president.
<P>
The target of the corporate campaign was Somers Building Maintenance
in Sacramento, California. Board member for the company, Randy
Schraber, said, &quot;We were the subject of wrongdoing, and we're
pleased to see that it won't happen to another company.&quot;
<P>
Rep. Pete Hoekstra (R-MI) had investigated the incident and concluded
that Mr. Sawyer had &quot;disclosed investigative information
which was damaging to Somers,&quot; and &quot;influenced the Department
of Labor's Wage &amp; Hour Division in an attempt to intimidate
Somers into recognizing the union.&quot; After Hoekstra made Sawyer's
action public, the DOL was forced to oust the presidential appointee.
<P>
An Inspector General's (IG) report investigating the California
incident confirms allegations that Sawyer threatened Hewlett-Packard.
The report also showed that no actions had been taken against
Somers in regards to charges that they violated wage and hour
laws. Half of California's wage and hour investigators had been
assigned to the Somer's case. According to Mr. Schraber, the investigators
found that the janitorial company actually <I>overpaid</I> its
workers between $300 - $600.
<P>
SEIU has quickly come to the defense of Sawyer by mobilizing California's
unions in a lobbying effort aimed at President Clinton and Reich
on his behalf. Hoekstra's subcommittee is planning to hold hearings
on the DOL's political motivation behind the Somer's incident
and other cases. The subcommittee will also look into alleged
politicization of OSHA and the National Labor Relations Board.
<P><a name="three"></a>
<i><B>AFL-CIO TO MEET IN WASHINGTON - </B></i>
<br>
<B>CLINTON ENDORSEMENT, SWEENEY TAX LIKELY</B> 
<P>
The AFL-CIO is expecting over 500 union delegates to gather at
the Capitol Hilton in Washington, D.C. next week. The union leaders
are expected to endorse President Clinton's reelection bid, and
ratify a special assessment on each union member to help subsidize
AFL-CIO Chief Sweeney's political and organizing agenda. Central
Council leaders will hold meetings on Sunday, March 24, and state
federation delegates will meet through Tuesday, March 26.
<P>
A key agenda item is the 15 cents monthly fee that each union
member will be charged, adding $2 million per month to union coffers.
The funds will go to pay for a $35 million dollar &quot;grassroots
campaign&quot; to heavily promote unions, as well as subsidize
an ongoing series of political ads targeting freshman Republican
members of Congress for elimination in this fall's elections.
The funds will also be used to step up the use of corporate campaigns.
Unions hope that the campaign will rally support for their political
agenda and establish a permanent pool of 100 union grassroots
activists in each Congressional district.
<P><a name="four"></a>
<i><B>Time Out for Teamsters</B> </i>
<P>
Grand theft is a felony which carries hefty prison terms and loss
of voting rights for life; but for Teamsters bosses, it brings
a one-year suspension. That is the penalty imposed by Teamsters
President Ron Carey against three Minnesota Teamsters officials
who were guilty of embezzling funds from their local.
<P>
In addition to their suspension, the three will be barred from
holding any Teamster office for two years. A fourth official was
permanently barred from membership or holding office, and all
must share in fines totalling $189,000.
<P>
An internal report by a court-appointed Independent Review Board
found numerous questionable practices, including selling union
cars at markedly discounted rates, and charging members fees to
attend their own union meetings.

<i><B>The Reich Report</B></i>
<P>
Labor Secretary Robert Reich touts &quot;corporate responsibility&quot;
on the speaking circuit, but it appears he has been a little more
than irresponsible with taxpayer dollars.  According to a <I>Wall
Street Journal</I> article, the Joint Committee on Printing (JCP)
contends that  Reich sidestepped federal guidelines by rushing
a printing job to an all-night copying service without &quot;prior
approval.&quot;  The JCP has rejected Reich's request to pay Kinko's
of Washington for the unapproved printing job.  Labor officials
finished President Clinton's &quot;Middle-Class Bill of Rights&quot;
too late they say to have the Government Printing Office (GPO)
do the job - the document was ready for printing late in the evening
on the eve of the State of the Union address last year.  The 18-page
document will reportedly cost taxpayers $31,380 - if Kinko's ever
gets paid - compared to the GPO price of $500.  Rep. Pete Hoekstra,
chairman of the House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigation
is apparently outraged by the waste.  The Labor Department contends
that the incident is turning into &quot;something political.&quot;
 
<P>
Perhaps the &quot;Middle-Class Bill of Rights&quot; should have
included a section on the responsible use of tax dollars by government
officials who portend to represent the hard-working middle class.
<P><a name="two"></a>
<i><B>BIG LABOR'S REAL AGENDA:</i><br>CORPORATE CAMPAIGN TARGET FIGHTS BACK
- VICTORIOUS OVER SEIU MILITANT TACTICS</B>
<P>
A Washington, D.C. jury may have stopped  a local Justice for
Janitors &quot;in-your-face&quot; campaign in its tracks.  The
decision may have an effect on similar cases nationwide according
to the winning attorney.
<P>
On October 21, 1993, Justice for Janitors invaded the headquarters
of United States Service Industries, Inc. (USSI), a janitorial
company that cleans office buildings in the D.C. area.  The nationwide
Janitors' campaign is the brainchild of former Service Employees
International Union (SEIU) leader John Sweeney who now heads the
AFL-CIO.  
<P>
According to a press statement released by USSI, Justice for Janitors
assaulted an officer of the corporation, and kept employees imprisoned
for several hours preventing them from leaving the building. 
<P>
Three USSI employees sued.  The Union settled with one employee,
and the other two went to trial.  A jury found there was an assault
and battery, as well as false imprisonment of both employees.
 One employee was awarded $1,000, and the other $2,000 in compensatory
damages by a jury verdict on March 11, 1996.  In addition, $30,000
in punitive damages were awarded on March 13, 1996, as a result
of clear and convincing evidence that the union demonstrators
were motivated by ill-will and willful disregard for the rights
of others.
<P>
USSI attorney, Joel Keiler, believes that future activities of
this kind could result in much larger punitive awards.  Keiler
also believes that individuals and companies nationwide will use
this verdict in their impending lawsuits, as will many of those
who were trapped by demonstrating SEIU &quot;Janitors&quot; who
blocked traffic on the 14th Street Bridge and the Roosevelt Bridge
in Washington, D.C.  last year.

<i> <B>NLRB's Gould Continues Campaign For Single-Site Rule</B></i>
<P>
Earlier this week in Tampa, Fla., National  Labor Relations Board
(NLRB) Chairman William Gould continued pushing for his proposed
single-site facility rule - a rule designed to help unions more
easily organize small businesses, and single units of multifacility
businesses such as fast-food restaurant chains.
<P>
The single-site rule would be a boon for AFL-CIO chief John Sweeney,
who wants to make good on his promise to more aggressively and
successfully organize the largely non-union service sector.  The
single-site rule applies one-size-fits-all standards to organizing,
applying illegitimate union organizing preferences over legitimate
market and business issues.  Opposition from the Republican Congress
and the business community has been fierce on the issue, but Gould
predicted that the NLRB would prevail.

<b><i>How</i> NOT <i>to Win Friends and Influence People</B></i>
<P>
Hoping to unionize thousands of Kaiser Permanente workers in North
Carolina, organized labor in that state has joined regulators
in denouncing the quality of care provided by the big HMO.  Criticizing
the product a company manufacturers may work in the case of bluejeans,
but a fatal flaw exists in the union's strategy  of attacking
the delivery of health care.  The unions are criticizing  the
very people they hope to organize - the HMO health care workers.
<P>
Of course, a &quot;fair&quot; contract is the cure prescribed
by the labor bosses.  They also hope it will undue any public
relations damage caused by the unions' smear campaign against
Kaiser Permanente workers.

<i><B>Minimum Wage Campaigns Take Off in the States</B></i>
<P>
As part of their multi-faceted election-year strategy to galvanize
union members to the polls, labor unions and allied groups are
aggressively attempting to put minimum wage increase initiatives
on the ballot in the upcoming November elections.  The AFL-CIO
is leading the signature gathering charge in most states with
the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN)
lending a hand.  Signature drives are up and running in Arizona,
California, Idaho, Missouri, Montana, and Oregon - with other
states targeted for activity soon.
<P>
On March 25, the AFL-CIO will hold a special meeting in Washington,
DC to kick-off their &quot;America Needs a Raise&quot; road show
(while at the same time increasing their own rank-and-file union
membership dues.)  The 29-city tour will promote the minimum wage
issue.  States that are currently considering starting wage increases
in state legislatures are also targeted for a campaign stop. 
For a complete listing of efforts to increase the starting wage
at the state and local level, contact Ren&eacute;e Stikes at 202-785-0238.
<P><a name="two"></a>
<i><B>Old Salt</B></i>
<P>
The career of the new chief organizer for the AFL-CIO, Richard
Bensinger, proves that unions are doing nothing new.  They're
just more blatant about it.
<P>
In the 1970's, while working as a paid union organizer, Bensinger
went undercover at a nonunion apparel plant in Colorado.  He was
quickly promoted into management, and was able to feed the union
valuable information on the company's response strategy to an
organizing campaign.
<P>
Today's unions, particularly those in the construction industry,
forego undercover work and opt instead to smother nonunion competition.
 The so-called &quot;salting campaign&quot; orders union members
to (1) apply for work at the target company, (2) make clear their
union affiliation, (3) organize other workers, if hired, (4) file
NLRB charges if not hired, (5) lure away good employees to work
for union contractors, and (6) generally create bedlam and other
problems on the job site - all at the direction of the union.

Bensinger is now directing the salting scheme nationwide that
he perfected in Colorado 20 years ago.  He serves as Deputy Director
of the AFL-CIO Organizing Institute.
<P>
Bensinger was quoted recently as saying: &quot;We're not crazy
radicals out to destroy a company; we're into cooperating with
a company...&quot;
<P>
The Electrical Workers are a little more honest about the real
purpose of salting campaigns: &quot;to threaten or actually apply
the economic pressure necessary to  cause the employers to...raise
his prices to recoup additional costs, scale back his business
activities, leave the union jurisdiction, go out of business,
and so on.<I> (IBEW Union Organizer Manual) </I>

<i><B>BIG LABOR'S REAL AGENDA: Palming Off Jobs </B></i>
<P>
<B> An Update From the Corporate Campaign Front</B>
<P>
Anywhere but in labor relations, barely mustering a support rate
of 14% is considered an abysmal failure.  But the Palm Restaurant
of Boston knuckled under to &quot;public pressure&quot; when 27
of 200 local celebrities refused to let their caricatures be hung
on the eatery's walls due to union complaints.
<P>
<I>Labor Watch</I> readers may recall this latest corporate campaign
which discovered this  particular victim's unique charm and sought
to destroy it.  The restaurant's well-known &quot;wall of fame&quot;
honors local notables as its feature attraction.  Construction
unions waged their anti-caricature campaign because they were
offended that the restaurant selected an open shop contractor
who bid 38% below the union competition.
<P>
Of the 200 celebrities offered spots on the restaurant walls,
only 27 - or less than 14%  - sided with the union and refused
to participate.  One of those sympathizers, Boston Mayor, Thomas
Merino, negotiated a deal that requires the restaurant to rebid
up to $100,000 of work using union workers.  All future work is
slated to go to union firms.  Even as the country approaches the
21st century, organized labor continues to demonstrate that an
aggressive minority - 15% union membership in the work force,
14% of celebrities - can overcome market and economic logic.

<i><B>Sweeny Predicts</B></i>
<P>
&quot;If Affirmative Action goes down, Davis-Bacon, the Service
Contract Act, the Fair Labor Standards Act and the minimum wage
bill will all follow,&quot; said AFL-CIO boss John Sweeney to
Jesse Jackson's Rainbow Coalition.  Now those fighting labor's
agenda know where to start.
<P><a name="five"></a>
<i><B>The Check is Not in the Mail</B></i>
<P>
What is it about the Post Office that promotes antisocial behavior?
 Postal union presidents are lambasting Postmaster General Marvin
Runyon in the harshest of terms for &quot;stingily, crassly, and
greedily&quot; postponing a cost of living increase for two weeks.
 The amount withheld from employee paychecks?  Four dollars.
<P>
Postal worker unions typically tie up the legal system by filing
petty complaints - amounting to 7% of the National Labor Relation
Board's entire case load. Forget the rain, sleet, and dark of
night ... a national grievance over a delayed increase of $4.00
is now worth halting mail delivery.

<i><B>AP Study Finds Unions Abuse OSHA</B></i>
<P>
Employee complaints to OSHA increase during labor unrest, according
to an extensive Associated Press (AP) analysis.  Over a third
of job site inspections prompted by complaints at unionized facilities
turn up no violations at all, says the AP study.  Complaints filed
by nonunion workers are more likely to lead to real safety problems
the study concludes.

<blockquote>
<i><B>Another Clinton Payback - When Even 99% Is Not Enough</B></i>
<P>
The AFL-CIO is complaining about a recent decision by the Clinton
National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) which went 99% of the way
to gutting important employee protections from union abuses. 
Eight years after the Supreme Court ruled that workers <U>cannot
be forced </U>to pay for the political activities of unions, the
Board issued its first interpretation of the so-called <U>Beck</U>
decision.  Except in the clearest form of political bankrolling,
according to the NLRB, unions are free to spread out their costs
among all members.
<P>
What has the unions so upset is the one part of the case that
went against them.  As AFL-CIO attorney Jon Hiatt said: &quot;Perhaps
the most significant - and distressing - aspect of the decision
is the holding that unions have a legal obligation to affirmatively
tell employees that they do not have to become union members.&quot;
 
<P>
<B>The unions are outraged that employees must be informed that
union membership is a choice, not a mandate.</B>
<P>
National Right-to-Work Committee spokesman Tom McCorville had
these comments regarding the real victims of the case:
<P>
&quot;A string of Supreme Court precedents have been ignored.
 Instead, the Clinton-appointed NLRB has genuflected to Big Labor
in an election year - when employees are most in need of protection
against forced dues politicking.  As far as Big Labor's forced-dues
funded political activities goes, it's business as usual.&quot;
<P><a name="two"></a>
<i><B>The High Price of a Sweeney Presidency</B></i>
<P>
AFL-CIO head John Sweeney promised to spend $35 million on political
activity this year to reportedly &quot;defeat Republicans,&quot;
but he never said where the money was going to come from.  It
now appears that Sweeney's &quot;American Needs a Raise&quot;
campaign will probably come out of the pockets of the rank-and-file
membership.
<P>
The high price of Sweeney's new campaign is in need of a new &quot;spending
stream.&quot; Consequently, a special convention has been called
for in late March to approve a new &quot;assessment&quot; on each
union member to subsidize Sweeney's political action agenda. 
The new &quot;Sweeney Tax&quot; is expected to cost members 15
cents per month (generating $20 million).  Each affiliated union
is expected to kick in a contribution as well.
<P>
Sweeney promised to recruit hundreds of thousands of new members
to invigorate the labor movement.  But it looks like he's going
back to the trough to further milk the rank-and-file membership
in order to subsidize an uninspiring union agenda.  
<P><a name="three"></a>
<i><B>BIG LABOR'S Real Agenda: Creating Some Havoc</B></i>
<P>
<B>Tales from the Corporate Campaign Front</B>
<P>
The following is the first installment in a case study on how
unions today try to crush those companies that fail to cave in
to their demands.  The case - the seven month old Detroit newspaper
strike.
<P>
Until now, the strike against the <I>Detroit Free Press</I> and
the <I>Detroit News</I> has utilized anticipated tactics:  replacement
workers have been terrorized, advertisers have been intimidated,
and NLRB charges have flowed.  The unions have proudly declared
that the newspaper companies have lost substantial amounts of
money, fostered bad will in the community, and the loss of newspaper
circulation will take a long time to rebuild.
<P>
The unions are now exploring ways to &quot;create some havoc -
to find leverage...,&quot; says Teamsters boss Ron Carey. Lately,
activists have been distributing propaganda at the headquarters
of <I>Detroit Free Press</I> parent Knight-Ridder, and its own
flagship paper, <I>The Miami Herald</I>.  Actions against <I>Detroit
News</I> owner Gannett are being promised at its <I>USA Today</I>
headquarters in suburban Washington.  As AFL-CIO leader Rich Trumka
vowed, &quot;We will be moving on a rather nationwide basis to
expose what Gannett is doing to workers in Detroit.&quot; 
<P>
What those moves will be is an indication of how far organized
labor will go in the 1990s to preserve featherbedding and other
rampant union abuses.
<P><a name="four"></a>
<i><B>Achy Breaky Kneecaps</B></i>
<P>
Billy Ray Cryus' dad is living his own version of the country
singer's smash hit, &quot;Achy Breaky Heart.&quot;  Ron Cyrus
has a number of jobs.  The senior Cyrus is the head of the Kentucky
AFL-CIO, a state Representative for Flatwoods, and Chairman of
the Labor &amp; Industry Committee in the state legislature.
<P>
Ron's latest opus is a bill to prohibit employers from hiring
permanent replacements during strikes in the strike-happy state.
 Billy Ray may make his fans swoon, but Dad appears satisfied
with bringing companies to their knees.
<P><a name="five"></a>
 <i><B>Command and Control Corporate Welfare</B></i>
<P>
Senate Democrats unleashed a set of proposals this week to appease
every ally of their party, while providing a boost to themes echoed
by Labor Secretary Robert Reich and - not surprisingly - principles
found within Labor's &quot;America Needs a Raise&quot; campaign.
<P>
The plan, called &quot;Building Allies for America's Working Families,&quot;
links business tax cuts and de-regulation to liberal, anti-business
precepts of class warfare, and statist ideals of  &quot;corporate
social responsibility.&quot;  Of course, the program is saturated
with union promotion.
<P>
In order to qualify for a tax cut, a company must limit CEO pay,
participate in a collectively bargained (union) pension plan utilizing
an employee trustee, invest in employee training on an ongoing
basis, and meet other standards that (for the most part) give
unions and the government control of participating businesses.
 The &quot;Building Allies&quot; program not only echoes AFL-CIO
themes, but is an integral part of the union's rebuilding effort.
 That is why &quot;Building Allies,&quot; in the name of economic
policy to help the struggling middle-class, also calls for treble
damages and debarment against businesses that violate labor laws.
<P>
As one commentator remarked, &quot;'Building Allies' is simply
more public relations gloss on the &quot;Unions Need a Boost&quot;
campaign by the new AFL-CIO leadership.

<i><B>Another Clinton Payback - Putting Unions First</B></i>
<P>
Vice President Al Gore paid homage to assembled union leaders
at their annual Bal Harbour, Florida retreat last week.  Mr. Gore
promptly delivered the President's response to union demands.
 The following is a partial score card:

<hr>
<P>
The AFL-CIO has set March 25th for its vote on whether to endorse
President Clinton for reelection.
<P><a name="two"></a>
 <B>A Dose of Democracy - Send in the U.N.?</B>
<P>
The Laborers International Union has a rich history of corruption.
 The Justice Department thinks it can change that with a healthy
dose of democracy.  The union has agreed to its first rank-and-file
election of officers, scheduled for September.
<P>
The Laborers leadership agreed to reforms in order to rid the
union of its tainted past of corruption and links to organized
crime, and to avoid a government takeover of its operations. 
The old system was so fraught with cronyism and fraud that a federal
overseer must now spend months devising election rules, teach
union members how to exercise rights they did not previously enjoy,
and monitor 500 local meetings where convention delegates are
selected.
<P><a name="three"></a>
<i><B>BIG LABOR'S Real Agenda:</B></i>
<P>
<B>Corporate Campaign Exposed</B>
<P>
Apparently organized labor's concerted effort to bring corporate
America to its knees devolves to the downright petty.  Construction
unions in Boston are trying to shame the Palm Restaurant into
paying prix fixe when a la carte makes more sense.
<P>
The unions are not picketing the site of the new restaurant. 
They are not attacking the company's building permits or filing
frivolous lawsuits.  They are not even trying to block financing
for the project by threatening local bankers.  Rather, <I>The
Wall Street Journal</I> reports that the building trades unions
are threatening the decor of the restaurant to force the Palm
to fire a non-union contractor and submit to build on the union's
terms (at a 38% premium).
<P>
Hoping to decimate the collection of celebrity caricatures which
adorn the walls of each Palm location, the unions are begging
local notables to pull their faces from the walls of the Palm.
 Several have acquiesced  - Sens. Ted Kennedy and John Kerry,
<I>Atlantic Monthly </I>editor Jack Beatty, and legal beagle Alan
Dershowitz.  Some, less sympathetic types, might consider this
urban renewal.
<P><a name="four"></a>
<i><B>Letter Carriers Are Big Winners in Oregon Vote-by-Mail Election</B></i>
<P>
According to a <I>Washington Times</I>  mention entitled &quot;Delivering
the Vote,&quot; the labor unions were quite pleased (in more ways
than one) with Oregon's recent special election.  The newspaper
notes:
<P>
&quot;The National Association of Letter Carriers (NALC), AFL-CIO
carried two headlines in its newsletter concerning Ron Wyden's
recent election to the Senate.  &quot;Letter Carriers Major Factor
in Wyden Oregon Senate Win,&quot; the NALC bulletin said.  &quot;Vote-by-Mail
Balloting Receives Praise.&quot;   
<P><a name="five"></a>
<i><B>AFL-CIO Charged with Crossing the Line in Campaign Activity</B></i>
<P>
The National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) filed a
complaint last week with the Federal Election Commission (FEC)
charging that &quot;PROJECT '95&quot; - an AFL-CIO special campaign
 - violated the law because its goals were to defeat House Republicans
using union members' dues.  The NRCC charges that the AFL-CIO
was engrossed in &quot;active electioneering&quot; in Federal
campaigns.  House Republicans on the PROJECT '95 target list were
saturated with radio and television advertising, and other outreach
activities in their congressional districts.  According to the
NRCC though, PROJECT '95 was coordinated with the Democratic Party
- the list of targeted House Republicans was distributed at a
key meeting of assembled House Democrats.
<P>
&quot;The AFL-CIO's PROJECT '95...misused the dues paid by the
hard-working men and women who belong to the member unions,&quot;
states a NRCC press release.  The NRCC also charges that AFL-CIO
chief John Sweeny's proclamation that the union will use $35 million
of its treasury to defeat Republicans in 1996 also violates federal
election law.

<blockquote>
<i><B>Another Clinton Payback - Fox in the Henhouse</B></i>
<P>
The name Sarah Fox is soon to become synonymous with the most
cynical form of union power grab.
<P>
Under attack for three years for politicizing the National Labor
Relations Board, the Administration pushed the envelope further
by naming Ted Kennedy's chief labor strategist to a recess appointment.
 Acting in the dead of night with questionable legal authority,
President Clinton installed the legislative specialist in the
role of labor law judge for a &quot;temporary&quot; appointment
for up to two years.
<P>
Control of the Labor Board gives the unions an opportunity to
revitalize their agenda.  Through selective enforcement of the
labor laws, complicity in union harassment campaigns and abolition
of long-standing employer protections, the pro-union NLRB will
seek to shift the balance of power clearly in favor of labor.
 Not to mention the fact that the Board rules on allegations of
unlawful union conduct as well.
<P><a name="two"></a>
<i><B>Reich Rhetoric</B></i>
<P>
The key solution to &quot;our greatest remaining challenge&quot;
is a strong union movement.  That is the declaration of Labor
Secretary Robert B. Reich in an official publication from his
Department.
<P>
Citing a host of newly discovered evils in the economy, Reich
declares, &quot;Closing the gap between paychecks and profits
is our greatest remaining challenge.&quot;  In addition to the
usual liberal solutions of raising the minimum wage and spending
more on training, Reich offers these telling steps:  <B>Enforcing
the Nation's labor laws</B> (against employers) and <B>Maintaining
a strong labor union movement.</B>
<P>
He states, &quot;Building strength through numbers is perhaps
the most important way workers can boost their bargaining power
in order to earn a family wage.&quot;  <I><B>Translation:  </B></I>Pandering
to union leaders in official Labor Department documents is perhaps
the most important way for Bill Clinton to secure labor's endorsement.
<P><a name="three"></a>
<i><B>Big Labor's Real Agenda:</B></i>
<P>
<B> Corporate Campaigns . . . Extortion by any other name</B>
<P>
Anywhere else but under the labor laws, actions to disrupt work,
run up costs and intentionally drive the company out of business
would be considered both criminal and tortuous.  But because unions
are considered &quot;special,&quot; the rules of law do not apply
to their so-called corporate campaigns.
<P>
The Electrical Workers describe their goal as follows:  &quot;to
threaten or actually apply the economic pressure necessary to
cause the employer to...raise his prices to recoup additional
costs, scale back his business activities, leave the union's jurisdiction,
go out of business, and so on.&quot;  (<I>IBEW Union Organizing
Manual)</I>
<P>
Again...extortion by any other name. 
<P><a name="four"></a>
<I><B>Two Wrongs Make a Filibuster</B></I>
<P>
Remember the scene in &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&quot;
in which Jimmy Stewart filibusters for hours <U>against </U>corruption
and wrong.  On behalf of the unions, Democrats are filibustering
the Labor Department funding bill in <U>support</U> of wrongdoing.
<P>
That bill in the Senate has a provision that would block enforcement
of President Clinton's Executive Order prohibiting federal contractors
from hiring permanent replacements for strikers.  The Order was
recently ruled <U>illegal </U>by a federal court - but organized
labor's friends keep filibustering.
<P><a name="five"></a>
<i><B>Unions Decline Further, </B></i>
<P>
<B>Except When Government is There</B>
<P>
Union membership continues to decline, this time by 300,000 workers
in 1994 to below 15% of the work force.  Where do unions remain
strongest? In industries with the closest relationship to government.
<P>
Federal, state and local governments employ about 6.9 million
union members, or about 37.8% of public employment.  In the private
sector, heavily regulated industries such as transportation and
public utilities had the highest level of unionization at 27%.
 Construction followed with 18%, helped in large part by the Davis-Bacon
Act and other laws which inflate public construction costs and
protect unions from competition.
<P>
Labor's former stronghold, manufacturing, continued its rapid
decline, suffering fully one-fourth of the overall loss in union
members for the year.  Not surprisingly, manufacturing in recent
years has moved further away from cohabitation with government
toward free competition.

<h2>
 Clinton probably won't be a TEAM player<BR>
</h2>
by <a href="/sbsc/kerrigan.html">Karen kerrigan</a>
</center>
<P>
<blockquote>
<hr>
August 1996 -- By far, the most effective and beneficial trend
in recent decades has been the empowerment of workers through
participation in quality circles, safety committees and other
&quot;teams.&quot;  While hundreds of businesses use the team
approach -- which allows managment and employees to confer over
issues of mutual concern and interest -- recent rulings by the
National Labor Relations Board have many employers concerned that
teams violate existing labor laws.
<P>
To correct the bias of the Depression-era law, both Houses of
Congress passed the TEAM, or Teamwork for Employees and Managers
Act -- legislation that creates a safe harbor for workers and
management to confer over issues of shared interest.
<P>
Section 8(a)(2) of the National Labor Relations Act makes it an
unfair labor practice for an employer to &quot;dominate or interfere
with the formation or administration of any labor organization
or contribute financial or other support to it...&quot;  The purpose
of the law then, was to outlaw sham unions created by a company
to avoid true unionization of the employer's workplace.
<P>
In the ensuing six decades since the law was written, the workplace
has experience tremendous changes, thus making the Depression-era
law outdated and restrictive.  In 1992, the NLRB ruled that many
cooperative teams are illegal in nonunion settings.  Critics claim
that the board ignored the fact that teams are established to
address important business concerns such as quality or production.
 Worker-management cooperative teams that took up topics such
as wages, hours and working conditions, traditionally the domain
of labor unions, were treated under the law in the same manner
as if managment had created a full-blown company union.  Numerous
other decisions have further narrowed the usefulness of teams.
<P>
Organized labor opposes the TEAM Act, claiming it allows for the
formation of company-sponsored unions while hindering union organizing.
 Supports of the act vehemently disagree.  They say it provides
an outlet for employees to express their concerns and offer opinions
when no union is on the scene.  And, with only 11 percent of the
private work force represented by unions, the number of workers
who could participate in the team concept is considerable.
<P>
David Thompson, Workplace Counsel for the Washington-based Business
Leadership Council, says passage of the TEAM Act by the Congress
represents a clear turning point in workplace policy.
<P>
&quot;We are glad to see that the House and Senate both rejected
the charge of union leaders that company efforts to solve problems
through consensus were part of a vicious plot to institute company
unions,&quot; says Thompson.
<P>
According to Thompson, labor leaders will oppose any effort to
modernize the law because it weakens their political influence
and sends them down the road to irrelevancy.
<P>
&quot;Workers and management understand the need for companies
to prosper in order to stay competitive in this highly-competitive
global economy.  That is why workplace cooperatio through the
team approach is so popular,&quot; adds Thompson.
<P>
Sen. Christopher &quot;Kit&quot; Bond, Rmo., chairman of the Senate
Small Business Committee, hailed the passage of the TEAM Act by
the Senate as a major victory for small business.
<P>
&quot;This is a common-sense measure that provides those 90 percent
of employees in America who do not belong to labor unions a stronger
voice in their workplace,&quot; he noted.
<P>
The TEAM Act will make its way to the White House, but President
Clinton has promised union leaders that he will veto the bill.
 The business community has responded that the veto would represent
more political pandering to labor leaders in exchange for the
exorbitant sums of money they are putting into key congressional
races to defeat Republicans.
<P>
Thompson of the BLC says it's a sad commentary on the state of
political affairs when the president of the United States would
hold back the growth, productivity and competitiveness of American
business in order to appease special interests.
<P>
Bond agrees and adds that President Clinton's failure to sign
the TEAM Act into law would prove beyond any doubt that he is
no friend of the small-business entrepreneur.

 Business Would Suffer Under Chemical Weapons<BR>

<blockquote>
<hr>
August 1996 -- On or before September 14, 1996, the U.S. Senate
will vote to ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) -- a
treaty with lofty goals to rid the world of chemical weapons.
 Meanwhile, thousands of American businesses are still unaware
that they will be forced to help end the production and stockpiling
of these treacherous weapons.  
<P>
For the first time in U.S. history, businesses using chemicals
for legitimate commercial purposes would be subject to international
inspections conducted by an agency falling under the umbrella
of the United Nations.
<P>
Opponents of the CWC are not only concerned that thousands of
small and medium-sized businesses would have to comply with extra-stringent
reporting requirements, but also question whether the treaty would
stop the proliferation, use and stockpiling of chemical weapons.
<P>
It is not only the big chemical companies that fall under the
treaty's new regulatory requirements, but small and medium-sized
ones that will be required to fill out burdensome paperwork and
host international bureaucrats through on-site inspections.
<P>
 Paint manufacturers, distilleries, automotive, biotechnology,
pharmaceutical, textiles, food processing and cosmetic companies
for example, could fall under the CWCW as a result of the chemicals
they use for legitimate manufacturing purposes.
<P>
According to information supplies to the Senate by the Arms Central
and Disarmament Agency, between 3,000 and 8,000 companies will
be affected by the treaty.
<P>
While several government agencies reviewing CWC document the cost
of the new treaty at $200 million per year, many experts conclude
that the costs will be much higher.  
<P>
Baker Spring of the Heritage Foundation suggest that the indirect
costs to businesses, such as those stemming from the loss of confidential
information are difficult to estimate, but &quot;billions in losses
are not out of the question.&quot;
<P>
Businesses covered by the CWC treaty would have to submit reports
to a new U.N. body called the Organization for the Prohibition
of Chemical Weapons on each chemical they use.  It is estimated
that the paperwork will take a firm about nine hours for each
&quot;Schedule 1&quot; chemical its production process uses, 7.2
hours for each &quot;Schedule 2&quot; chemical, and 2.5 hours
for each Schedule 3 chemical it uses.  
<P>
Many businesses both large and small use hundreds if not thousands
of chemicals in their manufacturing process.  Under the CWC, affected
businesses will be subjected to two types of inspection -- routine
and challenge.  The Defense Department estimates that large companies
could incur costs as high as $500,000 per inspection and small
firms may incur costs between $10,000 - $20,000.  Each business
inspected also must pick up the tab for the inspectors meals and
lodging.  
<P>
The inspectors would represent various countries signing the CWC,
but not the United States. 
<P>
 Besides sharing proprietary business information with international
inspectors, inspections may also involve production shutdown.
 Private businesses just learning of CWC implications are concerned
that such visits may compromise confidential business information
and produce significant costs.  
<P>
One medium-size company alerted the Senate that they use over
5,000 different chemicals in their production process of household
products and that the reporting system would impose a significant
administrative burden.  
<P>
Most disconcerting, though, is the claim by foreign policy experts
that rogue countries that harbor chemical weapons are not planning
to sign the treaty.  As non-signatories to the treaty, countries
such as Egypt, Iraq, North Korea, Syria and the Republic of China
will not be bound by CWC's provisions. 
<P>
 At the same time, American businesses will pay a huge price and
suffer real losses for a treaty whose goals cannot be met because
rogue countries will continue to stockpile and produce chemical
weapons.

Will You Be Required to File Electronically?<BR>
</h2>
by <a href="/sbsc/kerrigan.html">Karen Kerrigan</a>
</center>
<P>
<blockquote>
<hr>
The one thing that annoys business owners about Washington, D.C.
is the fact that they often find out about a new rule or regulation
well after it has been signed into law.  Most recently, thousands
of small and medium-sized businesses have been receiving notices
from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) about a new law passed
under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) which requires
more businesses to start filing their payroll taxes electronically
by January 1, 1997.<BR>

<P>
An unrelated provision to the 1993 NAFTA legislation required
that the federal government build a nationwide Electronic Federal
Tax Payment System (EFTPS) in order to receive federal depository
taxes electronically.  The new program began with 800 of the largest
U.S. businessses on January 1, 1995, and 800 more were added to
the mandated system at the beginning of 1996.  On January 1, 1997,
1.2 million more businesses were slated to become mandated electronic
filers.  That deadline has been extended to July 1, 1997 due to
the efforts of Senator Kit Bond (R-MO), Chairman of the Senate
Small Business Committee, and other business allies on Capitol
Hill.<BR>

<P>
According to phase-in requirements of the IRS' EFTPS, businesses
whose aggregate federal payroll tax deposits exceding $50,000
must begin depositing these taxes electronically.  The IRS began
informing small companies of the requirement with the following
notice: &quot;YOU MUST ENROLL AND DEPOSIT ELECTRONICALLY.&quot;
 To all the recipients of the IRS mailing, the notice came from
out of the blue.<BR>

<P>
When small businesses started complaining to members of Congress
about the surprise notices, Senator Bond and others stepped in
to help those targeted by the fast approaching deadline.  In a
July 24 letter sent to Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and IRS
Commissioner Margaret Richardson, Sen. Bond wrote that many small
busineses did not understand what the IRS notice meant in practical
terms.  Sen. Dale Bumpers (D-AK), ranking minority member of the
committee, co-signed the letter.<BR>

<P>
Senator Bond said that some small businesses in response to the
notices thought that the IRS would start &quot;debiting bank accounts
without taxpayer permission, while others believe that they must
invest in new computer and telephone systems in order to conduct
the transfers.&quot;<BR>

<P>
In another letter to Senator William Roth (R-DE), Chairman of
the Senate Committee on Finance, over thirty business organizations
-- including the American Payroll Association -- expressed concern
that the EFTPS system will not be prepared to handle over 1.3
million new electronic filers.  In addition, the business groups
assert that the IRS is not adequately education those obligated
to electronically file.<BR>

<P>
For example, the letter points out that in a recent meeting of
over 600 Certified Public Accountants held in Boston, not one
of the attendees knew of the mandate.  In addition, a survey city
by the letter confirms that most of the businesses falling under
the next phase-in are unaware of the new filing commitment --
over 70% of &quot;soon-to-be mandated taxpayers are not aware
of these requirements.&quot;  Also, spot calls of IRS district
offices have revealed that the tax-collecting agency's employees
are not even aware of the new requirements.<BR>

<P>
According to Sen. Bond, the need for the IRS to communicate more
effectively with small business taxpayers falls under the Small
Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA) which became
law in March.  Under SBREFA, federal agencies are supposed to
publish regulations in &quot;Plain English&quot; so that small
businesses can comply with the law.<BR>

<P>
Following the various letter writing campaigns to the IRS and
key committee chairman, the IRS published a Legislative Fact Sheet
on July 29.  In that four page summary, the IRS provides an overview
of the EFTPS in a question &amp; answer format.<BR>

<P>
Even so, for some business groups and others opposed to the phase-in
requirement, the new mandate will create a major new cost burden
that will disrupt many businesses.  Also, of the two options offered
by the IRS for electronic payment -- Automated Clearing House
&quot;Credit&quot; or &quot;Debit&quot; -- many small businesses
may not be able to select the credit option because local and
rural banks are not equipped to offer it.<BR>

<P>
Most problematic however is the fact the IRS and the Treasury
Department will not test the system first to determine if it will
properly work.  The business organizations writing to Congress
estimate that about 2 million businesses will be required to enroll
in the system, which means that financial agents will be processing
16,600 enrollments per day.  And if each taxpayer has two questions,
the IRS will be answering about 33,000 inquiries per day.<BR>

<P>
Under the new Small Business Jobs Protections Act passed early
August (the bill that hiked the minimum wage), the January 1997
deadline has been extended to July 1, 1997 so that businesses
can more fully understand how to comply with the new electronic
filing law.  The extension also gives the IRS more time to fully
educated small business, banks, payroll processors, and accountants
about the procedure.<BR>

<P>
Those businesses with less than $50,000 in payroll taxes may want
to take this opportunity to find out more about the requirements
-- 1999 the requirement drops to $20,000.<BR>

<P>
Is the IRS capable of answering questions that hundreds of thousands
of businesses will have about filing electronically, and will
they be prepared to fully implement the program on July 1, 1997?
 According to question #14 on their recent Legislative Update,
if a taxpayer does not understand the enrollment process, form
or instructions, they can call 1-800-555-4477 or 1-800-945-8400.

<h2>Chairman of House Small Business Committee A True
Champion<BR>
</h2>
by <a href="/sbsc/kerrigan.html">Karen Kerrigan</a></center>
<P>
<hr>
<br>
 Recently I had the opportunity to talk with the
Chairman of the House Small Business Committee. The topic was
the accomplishments of the 104th Congress regarding small business
issues.  Chairman Jan Meyers (R-KS) was proud of the record of
the 104th Congress, but expressed frustration with President Clinton
as many of the small business initiatives fell victim to his veto
pen.<BR>
<P>
The frustration stems from the fact that key tax
and regulatory reforms had &quot;enough support to pass both Houses
of Congress.&quot;  In addition, all of the reforms were priorities
that were recommended by the White House Conference on Small Business
-- an event called for by the President.  For example, legislation
to cut capital gains taxes, tort reform, increased expensing for
small businesses, and estate-tax reform, were passed by the House
and Senate (some by large margins with bipartisan majorities)
but rejected by the President.<BR>
<P>
 Meyers identified several reasons why more ground
wasn't won on behalf of small business.  For one, the Republicans
lost the media battle on key issues.  Also, the President portrayed
small business legislation as dangerous and unfair.  &quot;It's
difficult for us to respond to his type of bullypulpit,&quot;
stated Meyers.<BR>
<P>
 Many members of Congress feel that both the press
and the President successfully depicted Republican-led reforms
as &quot;extreme.&quot;  The multi-million dollar ad campaigns
sponsored by organized labor and environmental groups echoed this
theme.<BR>
<P>
 &quot;The tax issue is especially easy to demagogue,&quot;
says Meyers.  The Chairman refers to the fact that it is easy
to communicate in a ten-second sound bite that something &quot;benefits
the rich&quot;  According to Meyers its more difficult to quickly
articulate how cutting capital gains taxes provides job-creating
small businesses with access to capital to help start or grow
their enterprises.<BR>
<P>
Despite some of the criticism that Meyers has for
the President, she's more upbeat than critical and feels that
the Congress has indeed advanced the small business agenda on
Capitol Hill.  For one, she has changed the focus of the Small
Business Committee to actually focus on small business issues.
 The Committee's agenda is not random or personal, but one driven
by the needs of small businesses.<BR>
<P>
 &quot;We went to the small business community to
see what is important to them -- then we went after these issues,&quot;
says Meyers.<BR>
<P>
 Small business owners and various groups in Washington
representing the small business community feel welcome in Rayburn
2359 -- the committee hearing room where all the action takes
place.  Scores of small business owners and entrepreneurs have
been invited to testify before the Committee to deliver their
personal accounts of how they have been impacted by regulation
and taxes, or how they would benefit or possibly be hurt by legislation
before the Congress.<BR>
<P>
 And Meyers is proud that some pieces of legislation
originating in her Committee were signed into law by the President.
 For one, the Regulatory Flexibility Act has been strengthened
to protect small businesses from burdensome regulations.  The
strengthening of the Act will make, &quot;regulatory agencies
look more closely at rules and regulations and their impact on
small businesses before they put them out,&quot; states Meyers.
<BR>
<P>
 Under the leadership of Meyers, the health care
tax credit given to small businesses was increased from 25% to
30% and made permanent.  &quot;It was wrong for small businesses
to come to Congress each year and beg to have this credit extended.
 They couldn't plan for the future,&quot; she says.<BR>
<P>
 The Paperwork Reduction Act was also signed into
law requiring that the federal government reduce the paperwork
burden on Americans by 10% in its first year, and 5% annually
thereafter.<BR>
<P>
 The Committee has jurisdiction over the Small Business
Administration (SBA), and Meyers reports that they have been able
to trim the size of the agency &quot;without taking away a single
program of vital importance to small business.&quot;  The SBA's
budget was trimmed from $800 million to $500 million with its
popular loan programs intact.  The Chairman's goal was to provide
diligent oversight of the SBA loan program to ensure it remains
sound with a relatively low loss rate.<BR>
<P>
 Meyers has served on the Committee since 1985, and
admits that their are tough challenges ahead both for the Congress
and small business.  Earlier this year, she announced her retirement
from Congress and hopes to tackle one more issue before her departure..
 That issue is the SBA's 8(a) program -- a program that awards
contracts to minority-owned business noncompetitively.  Meyers
feels the program is riddled with fraud and abuse, and directly
contradicts the recent <U><I>Adarand</I></U> decision by the Supreme
Court.<BR>
<P>
 Meyers believes that the program began with good
intentions, but is now out of control.  According to Meyers, of
the $4.37 billion awarded in 8(a) contracts, only 9% are awarded
competitively.  The government can save taxpayers over $1 billion
if these contracts were competitively bid.  The Government Accounting
Office (GAO) reports that the 8(a) program has failed to foster
self-sufficiency for its small business participants.  According
to a GAO report, &quot;SBA's success in helping disadvantaged
firms to become self-sufficient and competitive was minimal...many
firms relied on 8(a) contracts and viewed the program an end in
itself.&quot;<BR>
<P>
 Meyers admits that because she has decided to tackle
this issue -- her preference is to abolish the 8(a) program --
she may leave Congress on a controversial note.  But Meyers feels
she has an obligation to address the issue.  &quot; I don't feel
comfortable leaving Congress without addressing this costly problem&quot;
she says.<BR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Whatever note she happens to leave on, the small
business community in Washington is unanimous that Chairman Meyers
has been a champion of small business during the 104th Congress.

<H2>Cost Of Government Makes July 3 A Special Day</H2><br>
by <a href="/sbsc/kerrigan.html">Karen Kerrigan</a></center>
<p>
<hr><p>
<blockquote>
On July 4, the United States celebrates its independence from Britain. On the same day, a Washington-based group says, Americans can celebrate their independence from having just paid their share of the cost of government.
<p>
Americans for Tax Reform, a government watchdog and taxpayer advocacy organization, figures that Americans spend more than half the calendar year working for the government. Cost of Government Day according to ATR, "is the date of the calendar year on which the average American has earned enough gross income to pay off all his or her direct and hidden taxes" - hidden taxes being the cost of regulation.
<p>
AU federal, state and local outlays (taxes plus borrowing) are included in Cost of Government Day. Although much of the public has become familiar with Tax Freedom Day - calculated by the Tax Foundation as the date when the average American's  earnings cover her tax bill - ATR believes it is important to include regulatory costs as well.
<p>
Cost of Government Day is calculated to help people understand the combined cost of the tax and regulatory burden. "The extra money and human resources businesses must spend to comply with regulations is just as much a financial burden on consumers as direct taxes. Regulations are essentially hidden taxes," says ATR President Grover Norquist.
<p>
According to the group, regulations are passed on to the consumer in the  of higher prices. Also, most economists acknowledge that regulatory costs are passed along from employers to employees in the  of lower wages while constraining a business's ability to invest and grow.
<p>
ATR has calculated the cost of government in 1996 at $3.38 trillion. That breaks down to $13,000 for every man, woman and child in America. Of that total, nearly $1 trillion results from federal and state regulation. The federal government alone accounts for more than $739 billion in hidden regulatory costs (more than $2,800 for every man, woman and child in America).
<p>
According to ATR, the total cost of state and local regulations is vastly underestimated because no quantifiable data has been assembled to account for all costs. For example, the costs associated with state and local environmental protection, worker safety and consumer protection are not included.
<p>
The cost of federal regulations, however, has been calculated by Rochester Institute of Technology Professor Thomas D. Hopkins, a leading authority on regulatory costs. Recently Hopkins conducted a study for the U.S. Small Business Administration documenting the impact of regulations on smaller companies. Hopkins found that the average federal regulatory cost per worker in smaller firms is three-quarters higher than for larger businesses.
<p>
And when businesses are surveyed, they consistently bemoan the burdensome nature of regulations. For example:
<ul>
<li>In March, the Center for the Study of American Business at Washington University in St. Louis reported that 52 percent of midsize companies surveyed said government regulation is their biggest challenge.
<li>In a recent survey of small manufacturers conducted by the National Association of Manufacturers, nearly half reported that regulations had prevented their hiring new workers.
<li>The SBA says that small-business owners spend 1 billion hours each year filling out government forms at a cost of $100 billion.
</ul>
Although most surveys have found that Americans believe federal regulations do more harm than good, this sentiment has not translated into a major regulatory overhaul in the federal government.
<p>
In fact, just the opposite has occurred. The Clinton administration's regulatory budget has
grown much faster than federal spending. And between 1989 and 1992 - during the Bush administration - the government burden on small business increased more than 34 percent, according to the House Joint Economic Committee.
<p>
Not only are businesses saddled with higher costs due to increased regulations, but county governments will be forced to spend almost $3 billion by 1998 to comply with mandates imposed by the Americans with Disabilities Act, according to estimates by the National Association of Counties.
<p>
Still, the ATR's Norquist believes Cost of Government Day will eventually roll backward instead of forward.
<p>
"While the new Congress has been attacked by defenders of the status quo for wanting to reform regulations and cut taxes for working families and small businesses, ATR believes we have only seen the beginning of the debate to overhaul the tax system, trim the size of government, and relieve Americans of burdensome regulations."
<p>
The 1996 elections will be a referendum on the size and scope of government, he believes.
<p>
While most Americans will be observing the country's independence on the Fourth of July, ATR hopes they also will observe what the government has cost them on July 3. According to Norquist, being informed is the first step to helping his group move Cost of government Day several days backward each year.

<blockquote>
What government costs taxpayers has been well-documented by many groups. And it's beginning to get even more attention.
<p>
According to the Washington-based Tax Foundation, "Tax Freedom Day" fell on May 7 this Year. That date marks the point at which the average American's earnings covered his or her tax bill for the year. "Cost of Government Day," a day calculated by Americans for Tax Reform, goes further by including taxes, regulations and total government spending. According to that group, the average person has not finished paying the government until July 3. Now, a Michigan-based group wants to remind workers how much government costs each pay period by including the information on payroll stubs. The Mackinac Center for Public Policy has developed "The Right to Know Payroll Form" to show workers the cost of government and how these costs translate into less take-home pay.
<p>
For years, watchdog groups have warned that increased regulation and taxation mean employers must pass costs on to employees through lower wages and fewer benefits. The right-to-know form shows how these mandates quickly add up to sizable amounts for each employee.
<p>
"Many workers don't realize the actual cost that government imposes through its spending and regulations. The Right to Know Payroll Form helps citizens become better able to participate in the democratic process because it makes them better informed," said Mackinac Vice President Joseph Overton.
<p>
Beyond the usual pay-stub information of state and federal income tax and Social Security payments, the Right to Know Payroll Form includes:
<ul>
<li>The employer's share of Social Security and Medicare taxes.
<li>The employer's unemployment insurance and workers' compensation costs.
<li>The costs of administering the taxes.
<li>The costs of complying with state and federal personnel-related mandates, such as the Americans With Disabilities Act and Family and Medical Leave Act.
</ul>
Employers are hit with additional regulations from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Internal Revenue Service, the Environmental Protection Agency and other government agencies. So, for most businesses, the right-to-know effort hits only the tip of the regulatory iceberg.
<p>
The business community has responded positively to the Mackinac project. According to Mackinac spokesperson Joseph Lehman, "dozens of private businesses are working to implement the.system right now."
<p>
The center launched their effort on Tax Freedom Day and continues to recruit employers to use the system.
<p>
In addition to employers in the private sector, Mackinac has found an unlikely partner - the state of Michigan. Starting in July, more than 60,000 state employees will receive revised pay stubs documenting how much money it takes to keep them on the payroll.
<p>
The new payroll stubs will include how much the state pays for the employee's share of Social Security and Medicare taxes and the state-paid portion of health insurance and other benefits.
<p>
According to the center, developing the data for a right-to-know form is simple. Beyond the standard payroll deductions shown on the typical pay stub, the form lists all the employer's costs. Such items as the employer's share of payroll taxes per employee, easily quantifiable government mandates and the administrative cost of compliance are included.
<p>
The employer's costs are itemized and deducted from the Estimated Payroll Allocation to produce gross pay. The withholding tax is subtracted from gross pay to produce net pay, just as most payroll forms do now.
<p>
According to the center's brochure promoting the right-to-know program; both employers and employees benefit. 
<p>
Workers understand better how government-imposed mandates affect job creation and growth. Employers understand better how mandates and taxes impact workers' pay.
<p>
For small companies, this is especially critical because they feel more harshly the effects of mandates and taxes.

<H2>Right To Know Form Shows Payroll Bite</H2><br>
by <a href="/sbsc/kerrigan.html">Karen Kerrigan</a></center>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<blockquote>
The amount that government costs taxpayers has been well-documented by a variety of groups.
<p>
According to the Washington, D.C.-based Tax Foundation, "Tax Freedom Day" fell on May 7 this year. That date marks the point at which the average American's year-to-date earnings covers his tax bill for the year. "Cost of Government Day," a day calculated by Americans for Tax Reform, goes further by including taxes, regulations and total government spending. According to that group, the average person works for the government until July 3.
<p>
Now, a Michigan-based group, wants to remind workers how much government costs them each pay period by including this information on employee payroll stubs. The Mackinac Center for Public Policy has developed "The Right to Know Payroll Form" to show workers the cost of government and how these costs translate into less take-home pay.
<p>
The Mackinac Center says that workers will benefit from the new pay stub because it shows employees the cost of government programs and mandates.
<p>
For years, watchdog groups lamenting the size and scope of government have warned the public that increased regulation and taxation mean that employers have to pass these costs on to employees through lower wages and fewer benefits. The Right to Know Form breaks down those costs by showing how these mandates quickly add up to sizable amounts per employee.
<p>
"Many workers don't realize the actual cost that government imposes through its spending and regulations. The Right to Know Payroll Form helps citizens become better able to participate in the democratic process because it makes them better informed," said Mackinac Vice President Joseph Overton.
<p>
Although pay stubs already show the employee's share of state and federal income tax and Social Security payments, the Right to Know Payroll Form includes other costs. These unseen costs include the employer's share of Social Security and Medicare taxes; the employer's unemployment insurance and workers' compensation costs; the costs of administering such taxes; and the costs of complying with state and federal, personnel-related mandates, such as the Americans With Disabilities Act and Family and Medical Leave Act.
<p>
Employers are hit with additional regulations from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Internal Revenue Service, the Environmental Protection Agency and other government agencies. So for most businesses, the right to know effort only hits the tip of the regulatory iceberg.
<p>
The business community's response to the Mackinac project has been positive. According to Mackinac spokesperson Joseph Lehman, "dozens of private businesses are working to
implement the system right now."
<p>
The Mackinac Center launched the effort on Tax Freedom Day and is actively recruiting employers. Although many employers in the private sector have called the center to pledge their adoption of the payroll form, Mackinac has found an unlikely partner - the state of Michigan.
<p>
Starting in July, more than 60,000 employees of the state will receive revised pay stubs, which will document how much is paid to keep them on the payroll. While Michigan did not include all Right to Know Payroll Form recommendations, the new payroll stubs will include how much the state pays for the employee's share of Social Security and Medicare taxes, and the state-paid portion of health insurance and other benefits.
<p>
According to the center, developing the cost data to use for a firm's own right-to-know form is simple. Beyond the standard payroll deductions that are shown on the typical pay stub, the Right to Know form extends payroll accounting to include all the employer's costs. Such items as the employer's share of payroll taxes per employee, easily quantifiable government mandates and the administrative burden of complying with such costs are included.
<p>
Firms participating in the program have used accountants and tax and benefits managers to calculate these costs to determine the average cost per employee. Once the costs are estimated, they are added to the gross pay to produce an Estimated Payroll Allocation.
<p>
On the form, the employer's costs are itemized and deducted from the Estimated Payroll Allocation to produce gross pay. The withholding tax is subtracted from gross pay to produce net pay, just as most payroll forms do now.
<p>
According to the center's brochure promoting the Right to Know program, both employers and employees benefit. Workers will better understand how government-imposed mandates impact job creation and growth.
<p>
Also, employees will better understand how mandates and taxes impact workers' pay. For small firms, this is especially critical as mandates and taxes are more harshly felt by this sector of the economy.

<H2>Wage Hike Won't Help The Poor But Will Hurt Business</H2><br>
by <a href="/sbsc/kerrigan.html">Karen Kerrigan</a></center>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<blockquote>
Who would have thought our nation's small businesses would be facing a mandated increase in their labor costs under a Republican-controlled Congress? President Clinton had the opportunity to push through a minimum-wage increase during his first two years in office, but chose not to.
<p>
But the politics of an election year are shifting into high gear, and each party is looking for ways to shore up its base of support. For the Democrats, an increase in the minimum wage is the perfect way to show the American public that they care about the working class. It also ensures that the labor unions will continue to support the Democrats' campaign to win back control of Congress.
<p>
Increasing the minimum wage will do little to help the working poor in America, but the emotional appeal of the issue obviously benefits the party that is pushing it. To that extent, the Republicans don't want to appear uncaring, so they're working to craft a package they feel will more adequately respond to the needs of the working poor.
<p>
But first, some of the facts regarding who benefits from an increase in the minimum wage:
<ul>
<li> According to the Democratic Leadership Council, a moderate group of Democrats that Clinton once headed, more than 70 percent of minimum-wage workers are in families that are well above the poverty level. Nearly 40 percent of the workers are in families with incomes in the top half of the income distribution.
<li>Of the 1.96 million workers who earned the minimum wage in 1995, 59 percent were 24 years old or younger, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
<li>Analyzing the 12 million workers who make between $4.25 and $5.15 an hour (the proposed new wage), the Employment Policy Institute found that only 9 percent of these workers are married and their families' sole wage earner. Only 3 percent are single parents.
<li> Also, according to Employment Policy Institute, the average wage of minimum-wage workers increases from $4.25 to $6.08 an hour within a year.
</ul>
Wage-hike proponents say that the minimum wage is at a 40-year low. But this declaration, made often by Labor Secretary Robert Reich, compares apples to oranges. Forty years ago, the minimum wage applied mostly to skilled jobs in manufacturing and transportation - restaurant and retail jobs were exempt. Reich and his fellow wage-hike crusaders are essentially comparing the pay of skilled workers yesterday to unskilled workers today.
<p>
Of course, the small-business lobby in Washington is not surprised that it must continue to fight wage-hike proposals. According to an industry representative fighting against the wage increase, "The American public continue to support an increase in the starting wage because it's a feel-good proposal. Unfortunately, most Americans do not understand the harmful effects of artificial wage hikes - they cost jobs and cause price increases for the working poor."
<p>
The Democratic Leadership Council appears to agree. In a recent position paper on the wage increase, the council asserts that "the costs of an increase ... would be borne disproportionately by lower-income families" because they would be forced to pay higher prices. The council calls this a "regressive transfer, making most poor people a little worse off in order to improve the lives, at least for a time, of a group of people that is predominately nonpoor."
<p>
Recognizing this dynamic, one Republican freshman has come up with a creative idea to allow minimum-wage workers to keep more of their pay rather than allowing the government to eat away at their wages.
<p>
Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind., proposes allowing minimum-wage earners to keep the payroll taxes that are currently withheld from their paychecks. McIntosh is calling his increase proposal the Minimum Wage Tax Cut. According to the freshman member, the proposal would increase the take-home pay of those earning the minimum wage without causing the job losses that a government-mandated wage hike would produce. It's estimated that an increase in the minimum wage would cost the economy 300,000 to 500,000 jobs.
<p>
McIntosh's proposal would cut federal taxes for workers earning between $4.25 and $5.25 an hour by allowing them to keep federal income, Social Security and Medicare taxes - now deducted from their paychecks. The proposal would raise workers' net hourly rate to $4.57, compared with the current $3.76 when federal withholdings are deducted.
<p>
"What proponents of raising the minimum wage to $5.15 don't tell you is that after federal taxes are deducted, workers will only take home $4.56 an hour," McIntosh said. "By avoiding government-mandated wages, taxes can be cut for minimum-wage earners and their weekly paychecks will increase," he added.
<p>
Early estimates of the McIntosh proposal by the Congressional Budget Office show that it could cost $8 billion to $10 billion annually. To make up the difference, McIntosh proposed cutting federal welfare by 10 percent, amounting to $9 billion. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the 90-cent wage increase will cost businesses about $12.5 billion over five years.
<p>
But whatever the wage hike will cost the business community, most of the evidence proves that the real losers would be lower-skilled workers who become priced out of the labor market.

<H2>Small Businesses Fighting For Medical Accounts</H2><br>
by <a href="/sbsc/kerrigan.html">Karen Kerrigan</a></center>
<p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>
Another health-care reform battle is brewing on Capitol Hill. But rather than fighting against employer mandates, small-business organizations and their allies are fighting to include medical savings accounts in health-care legislation this year.
<p>
What is an MSA? An employer takes a portion of funds currently spent on health insurance and deposits it into an MSA - up to $2,000 for an individual or $4,000 for a family.
<p>
The money can be used to pay for out-of-pocket medical expenses. Some can be used to purchase a catastrophic policy covering all medical expenses after a deductible is met. And, at the end of the year, the insured can keep any unused MSA funds.
<p>
This provides an incentive for the insured to shop around for healthcare needs - injecting much-needed competition into an industry in which the third-party payment system has left the consumer with no incentive to spend less.
<p>
Under the Health Coverage Availability and Affordability Act of 1996 passed by the House of Representatives, individuals and the self-employed could deduct from their federal taxes 100 percent of the funds deposited in their MSAs. This would be in addition to the 35 percent of a catastrophic policy premium they are already allowed to deduct.
<p>
This feature, say MSA advocates, would make individual taxes fairer in comparison to what corporations pay. And tax equity, combined with the portability feature, would help
solve the "job-lock" problem experienced by so many Americans who want to change jobs.
<p>
The Kennedy-Kassebaum bill in the Senate does not include an MSA provision. Key Democrats have said MSAs were too controversial to include, and they are aggressively working to make sure that MSAs are kept out.
<p>
MSAs have long been supported by small business. At the White House Conference on Small Business in June 1995, the adoption of MSAs was a key recommendation delegates sent to the president and Congress. In fact, it's estimated that nearly 3,000 businesses - mostly small and medium - are currently using an MSA prototype.
<p>
Evidence reveals that MSAs help reduce health-insurance costs for businesses, while giving employees greater physician choice and control over health-care spending.
<p>
That's why MSA supporters are baffled at flip flops-taken by politicians who have been long-time supporters. In particular, minority leaders Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., in the House and Tom Daschle, D-S.D., in the Senate are leading the charge against MSAs, despite the fact that both were champions of MSAs in the previous Congress.
<p>
Less than two years ago, when asked about the prospect of MSAs being included in health-care reform, Gephardt responded, "Absolutely. This is an idea the Ways and Means Committee has worked-on for three or four years. It's very popular . . . I think it's a great option."
<p>
In fact, MSAs unanimously passed the Ways and Means Committee in the last Congress. Every member of the committee, with the exception of one Democrat, voted for them. In the current Congress MSAs were included in the bipartisan balanced-budget package sent to President Clinton, which he subsequently vetoed.
<p>
Just recently, Sen. Daschle referred to MSAs as the "Dr. Kevorkians of health reform, but in the last Congress he cosponsored the Medical Cost Containment Act of 1992, which according to the legislation, "would allow employers to provide their employees with an annual allowance in a Medical Care Savings Account to pay for routine health-care needs."
<p>
MSA advocates say the flip-flops exhibited by Daschle and Gephardt smack more of partisan politics than a newfound skepticism of MSAs.
<p>
"This is what the American people hate about Washington," said Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, a longtime advocate of MSAs.
<p>
"Because some Democrats view this as a simple case of Republicans getting credit for a popular reform, they are stonewalling with the hope of receiving some sort of partisan gain," Norquist added.
<p>
With recent reports showing that proposals like Kennedy-Kassebaum have been an abysmal failure in states that have enacted similar reforms - such as the total collapse of the health-insurance system in Washington state - antics on Capitol Hill to kill MSAs may backfire.
<p>
According to MSA advocates, a grassroots revolution is brewing in favor of the reform, especially among small businesses and the self-employed. Indeed, President Clinton is attempting to reach out to constituencies that he has not been too popular with in the past. The support of MSAs may be one of those issues he finally embraces.

<H2>'A-Corps' Plan Would Hobble Small Business</H2><br>
by <a href="/sbsc/kerrigan.html">Karen Kerrigan</a></center>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<blockquote>
Democrats and Republicans are both marketing themselves as job creators and wage boosters, placing American business at the center of their policy prescriptions. Their proposed solutions, though, are ideological opposites.
<p>
To Republicans, the key to robust economic growth, higher wages and more jobs lies in providing businesses with significant tax and regulatory relief.
<p>
Their solutions also include giving individuals the widest options available for obtaining financial security, education and training, and benefits such as health care through the equalization of tax benefits.
<p>
Democrats believe American business won't help workers on its own and that the federal government must provide the incentives to encourage business to do so.
<p>
According to Secretary of Labor Robert Reich, "If we want companies to do things which do not necessarily improve the returns to shareholders, but which are beneficial for the economy and society as a whole . . . we have to give business an economic reason to do so."
<P>
But rather than provide all businesses with across-the-board tax and regulatory relief, proposals being offered by Reich and Democratic leaders in the House and Senate would reduce taxes and regulations only for companies that achieve "certain minimum requirements."
<p>
Democratic Sen. Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico, chairman of the Senate Task Force on High Wage Jobs, recently released a package of proposals aimed at alleviating economic insecurity and wage stagnation.
<p>
The report, titled "Scrambling to Pay the Bills: Building Allies for American Working Families," would provide businesses with favorable tax and regulatory treatment if they meet certain tests established by the federal government.
<p>
"A-Corps" businesses would be required, for example, to meet some of the following standards: 
<ul>
<li>Contribute an amount equal to at least 3 percent of payroll to pension plans.
<li>Commit an amount equal to at least 2 percent of payroll for employee training.
<li>Offer all U.S. employees a health-care plan approved by the government. Employers would have to pay at least 50 percent of the plan's cost.
<li>Give employees the option of participating in a profit-sharing, stock option or stock ownership plan. An employee-elected trustee would manage the plan.
<li>Place caps on compensation for the chief executive officer and other employees.
<li>Make sure at least 90 percent of plant and equipment purchases, and employment costs resulting from product and service production, delivery and consumption in the United States occurred in the United States.
<li>Meet or exceed all occupational, safety and environmental standards.
<li>Pay dues and belong to an industry association approved by the Department of Commerce.
</ul>
Businesses meeting the criteria would be given a favorable tax rate, their current corporate income tax replaced with a "business activities tax." Under a BAT plan, payments companies make to other businesses, including the purchase of new equipment and plant construction, are subtracted from taxable income. Only imports would be taxed.
<p>
A-Corps participants would receive a lower tax rate than nonparticipating businesses, though the proposal doesn't specify what those rates might be. However, under the BAT system, small businesses with gross annual receipts of $100,000 would be exempted from the tax.
<p>
In terms of regulatory relief for A-Corps participants, businesses would still be required to meet all federal laws, but could get quicker review and decision-making from federal agencies; participate in voluntary compliance programs; and take advantage of safe-harbor provisions from certain regulatory requirements.
<p>
Qualified A-Corps companies would also be given special treatment in bidding on government contracts.
<p>
Critics of Bingaman and Reich's approach charge that the "most-favored" corporate method is flawed in that businesses could not possibly participate in the A-Corps program without giving up control to the federal government.
<p>
In addition, they say, the proposal assumes businesses do not value workers - a predisposition that runs counter to reality. An economic policy update issued recently by the Senate Joint Economic Committee contends the "corporate responsibility" proposals would "make workers more dependent on their current employers at a time when public policy should be encouraging individual responsibility through upward mobility and portable benefits."
<p>
In addition, the IEC report argues that these policies would discriminate against small businesses and the self-employed.
<p>
According to the report, "because [small businesses] need to invest in building the business, they're less likely to have the free cash to spend on 'corporate responsibility.'
<p>
Also, says the study, a more prudent course would focus tax benefits on individuals, whether or not they receive health insurance, pension plans and worker training from their employers or elsewhere in the marketplace.
<p>
The best way to help the economy and individuals would be to expand individual retirement accounts, make pensions truly portable by allowing individuals the same tax benefits as company-sponsored plans, enact medical savings accounts and lower the marginal tax rates for all.
<p>
As Democrats and Republicans on the campaign trail and in Washington struggle to articulate their competing messages to the American people, small businesses already know what needs to be done to allow their businesses to grow and succeed. Entrepreneurs need help competing against global competitors.

<H2>Finally, Congress Moves To Limit Tax Increases</H2><br>
by <a href="/sbsc/kerrigan.html">Karen Kerrigan</a></center>
<p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
Most analysts agree that reviving tax cuts is a political nonstarter this year. Congress approved a balanced-budget package coupled with tax cuts for small business, but it stopped short at President Clinton's desk.
<p>
With April 15 fast approaching millions of small business owners and taxpayers look at the annual ritual with anger and frustration. But certain members of Congress are banding together to make sure that raising taxes will be just as difficult as cutting them.
<p>
On April 15, the House of Representatives will vote on a Tax Limitation Amendment to the Constitution that would require a two-thirds majority vote of each house of Congress to increase taxes. The effort is being led by Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, along with a bipartisan group of House members including Pete Geren, D-Texas; Ralph Hall, D-Texas; and John Shadegg, R-Ariz.
<p>
On the same day, the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Federalism and Property Rights will hold hearings on a companion resolution to the tax-limiting amendment, introduced by Sen. Jon Kyle, R-Ariz.
<p>
Proponents of the amendment contend a constitutional requirement is absolutely necessary to protect taxpayers from the unending tax increases that followed the adoption of the 16th Amendment in 1913. Before the 16th Amendment was enacted, no income tax was allowed. Since then, federal tax collections have climbed more than 175,000 percent.
<p>
Tax-limitation amendments are not untested. Already, 28 states have some form. Ten have adopted the majority legislative vote to approve higher taxes, and one-third of states require more than a majority, according to Americans for Tax Reform.
<p>
Studies have shown clearly the effect of higher taxes on economic growth. A 1993 study by the Joint Economic Committee of Congress tracking state economies during 1989 to 1993 found:
<ul>
<li>The top 10 income tax-increasing states lost nearly 200,000 jobs from 1989 to 1993. The top 10 income tax-reducing states created nearly 1 million.
<li>Unemployment rose by 2.3 percent in the states that increased taxes the most, but only by .3 percent in the income tax-cutting states.
<li>Income per family of four fell by an average of $600 in the tax-increasing states, and rose $150 in the top 10 tax-cutting states.
</ul>
Tax increases are especially hard for the small-business, entrepreneurial sector, which the United States depends on for creating jobs.
<p>
The 1993 tax hike, for example, was sold as a plan to soak the rich but the majority of those affected were small businesses. A 1994 Small Business Survival Committee survey found that 28 percent of respondents raised prices, 26 percent postponed expansion plans, 14 percent terminated one employee, and 9 percent were forced to take two of the actions.
<p>
Tax-limiting proponents say the 1993 tax hike never would have made it into the history books if the two-thirds majority requirement had been in place. The increase passed by only one vote in the House and Senate.
<p>
According to Americans for Tax Reform four of the last five tax increases were passed with less than a two-thirds majority. They added $666 billion to the tax bill of American taxpayers.
<p>
Does a tax limitation requirement have the support of the public? In 1992, a National Taxpayer's Union Foundation survey found that 78 percent of respondents favored "a constitutional amendment that would- limit the growth of federal taxes."
<p>
More recently, delegates to the 1995 White House Conference on Small Business recommended to the president and Congress that a two-thirds majority requirement be adopted.
<p>
Taxpayers may want to tune into C-SPAN April 15 to see which members of Congress argue to limit increases and which members argue for unlimited power to dig deeper into their pockets.

<H2>Immigration Reform Taking Center Stage</H2><br>
by <a href="/sbsc/kerrigan.html">Karen Kerrigan</a></center>
<p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
If anyone forgot that the immigration issue is emotionally charged, Republican presidential hopeful Pat Buchanan is aggressively reminding America about the issue's volatility.
<p>
Among other measures, Buchanan proposes to erect some type of stronghold along the southern border of the United States and impose a five-year moratorium on legal immigration.
<p>
Congress, meanwhile, is prepared to take action on immigration reform legislation, and the business lobby in Washington is gearing up to oppose provisions that would put employers at the center of enforcing the nation's immigration laws.
<p>
American Business for Legal Immigration - which was formed to protect legal employment immigration - recently held a press conference in Washington to announce its opposition to Wyoming Republican Sen. Alan Simpson's immigration proposal, the Immigration Reform Act of 1995. Simpson's legislation calls for the following:
<ul>
<li>A 35 percent cut in business-related immigration each year, equating to a reduction of 50,000 employment-based visas (from 140,000 to 90,000);
<li>requiring employers who hire legal immigrants to subsidize training programs for U.S. workers;
<li>new taxes - each employer would be required to pay either $10,000 or 10 percent of the foreign worker's annual compensation package (whichever is higher) to the U.S. government;
<li>more regulations, restrictions and paperwork.
</ul>
Simpson's bill attempts to tackle both illegal and legal immigration reform in one sweeping measure. But ABLI contends that it is misguided to combine the two issues, blurring the distinction between the value that skilled legal immigrants bring to the U.S. economy versus a different set of concerns Americans have with illegal immigration.
<p>
"Although Simpson's proposal does seek to address the issue of illegal immigration in the U.S., it confuses legal and illegal immigration and unreasonably threatens the competitiveness of American business in today's global marketplace," says ABLI Director Jennifer Eisen. ABLI strongly supports differentiating between the problems posed by illegal immigration and the benefits of legal immigration.
<p>
ABLI members defend their need to search for and hire skilled talent where they can find it to boost U.S. competitiveness. The coalition also contends that in a highly competitive global economy, it is unrealistic for U.S. policy leaders to attempt to hinder and micromanage employer personnel decisions on top of the current requirements in the legal immigration system.
<p>
According to Kirby Dyess, corporate vice president of Intel Corp., his company already wades through six inches of government forms to comply with regulations and paperwork for each foreign professional it hires. The cost per employee is approximately $7,000 to $10,000. "We don't go through all of this time and expense to displace U.S. workers," Dyess says.
<p>
Harris Miller, president of the Information Technology Association of America, agrees with Dyess. Miller explains that the overhead costs associated with hiring a foreign worker today are sufficient to make it the last resort for most employers. As a result, the current ceiling for business visas is not being reached. ABLI says that employers use about 93,000 of the 140,000 employment-based visas available.
<p>
ABLI also asserts that legal immigrants stimulate domestic job growth by bringing much-needed expertise, technological skill and patented concepts to the nation's industries and economy. Innovations by legal immigrants have propelled American companies to new successes and have allowed these companies to capitalize on new product inventions and technologies.
<p>
ABLl and its members agree that illegal immigration is a problem that must be addressed. Although efforts to split the legislation to address legal and illegal immigration may win out, the business lobby is also concerned about provisions that attempt to stop illegal immigration.
<p>
For example, both House and Senate legislation include proposals to put into place a centralized employment verification system operated by the federal government. Employers would be required to call a government toll-free number to identify the worker as eligible and give the prospective employee's Social Security number.
<p>
During this big political year, politicians and U.S. presidential hopefuls are reacting to hot emotional issues. But quick and rash policy prescriptions for the nation's illegal immigration problem could end up hurting the U.S. economy more than it will help if both legal and illegal immigration are "reformed" in one sweeping measure.

<H2>OSHA Reforms Winding Through Congress</H2>
<p><br>
by <a href="/sbsc/kerrigan.html">Karen Kerrigan</a></center>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<blockquote>
Despite the first session of the 104th Congress marking a historic change in the direction of the federal government, far-reaching legislative initiatives have been stalled by the ideological and procedural differences in the House and Senate.
<p>
The House can successfully boast of many tax, regulatory and fiscal reforms it passed in 1995. But without-similar action in the Senate, Congress can't claim a long list of legislative accomplishments, which provide the conventional yardstick by which the media and public measure a productive Congress.
<p>
As Congress-bashers contend that a "do nothing" Congress is the best kind, political analysts predict that President Clinton may exploit Congress' record and pull a page out of campaign history books in his attempts to secure a second term in the White House.
<p>
Just as Harry Truman ran successfully against a "do-nothing" Congress in 1948, President Clinton is considering that strategy in 1996. The "do-nothing" label is something Congress will try to avoid, so congressional leaders are taking a second look at their unfinished 1995 agenda.
<p>
Plenty of opportunities exist to pass meaningful tax and regulatory reforms without stirring up too much of a special-interest hornets' nest. The re-evaluation, say observers, will match targeted legislative opportunities with 1996 political realities.
<p>
OSHA reform is one such area where Congress may accept modest legislative gains. The President and Congress agree that the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) needs to be reformed. Differences arise, of course, when the degree of reform is discussed.
<p>
Republican Rep. Cass Ballenger of North Carolina proposed an OSHA reform bill last year in the House, and it appears that the Senate may soon act on a lighter version of his bill.
<p>
Republican Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas is resurrecting the reform effort in the Senate, with Sens. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., and Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., taking lead roles through co-sponsorship of S.R. 1423, the Occupational Safety and Health Reform and Reinvention Act.
<p>
"Since OSHA was created 25 years ago, the agency has expanded its authority far beyond the original intent of Congress," Hutchison said. "As a result, companies must worry about compliance with standards and regulations that have little or nothing to do with real safety issues."
<p>
S.R. 1423 strives to address real safety issues instead of penalizing business owners for paperwork violations and minor infractions.
<p>
The costs of these so called violations can add up to big fines, as one small roofing company in Houston learned.
<p>
The company was fined 23 times for a total of $13,000 for the following violations: A cut in the insulation of an extension cord that was no longer in use, a bent rung on the bottom of a ladder and a splintered handle on a discarded shovel.
<p>
The Senate reform bill redirects OSHA's energy to consultation programs and voluntary compliance. The bill would codify the Voluntary Protection Program, which exempts employers from general inspections if they have excellent safety and health records.
<p>
There would also be a reduction in penalties for nonserious violations (for example, nonserious hazard citations would be lowered from $7,000 to $100), and penalties waived for nonsignificant violations. Warnings would be issued in lieu of citations, and OSHA inspector quotas would be prohibited.
<p>
Employees would be encouraged (not required) to complain to their employer before they call OSHA. Employee involvement in safety committees is also encouraged through federal labor law modifications.
<p>
Most critically for business, the bill recommends that the employer should not be held responsible if a trained employee disregards health and safety rules.
<p>
OSHA itself has recognized the need to change.
<p>
If there is general agreement on basic principles, is it possible that an OSHA reform bill could move through both houses of Congress and on to the president for his signature?
<p>
Perhaps, but organized labor could deal a blow to even minor reform efforts. Labor unions are opposed to OSHA tinkering, which puts the president in a pickle if a reform bill makes its way through both chambers of Congress. The president is dependent on labor's support and big money for the '96 election.
<p>
Signing an OSHA reform bill backed by the majority of Congress could prove to the electorate and small businesses that the president indeed is governing like a "New Democrat." There's a good chance, though, that election-year friends like the "Old Democrat" much better.

<p>
If you ask most small-business owners, every politician talks a good game of making our
nation's tax system less burdensome. The immense task of overhauling the system, though, keeps most politicians talking. Tax reform is again taking center stage, and perhaps in the near future, tax system overhaul may actually become a reality.
<p>
Many small businesses agree with Republican presidential hopeful Steve Forbes when he says we need to "drive a stake" through the current tax system.
<p>
The small-business sector - responsible for most of the dynamic growth in the economy - fares the worst under the current system. Not only do high taxes inhibit small business growth and job creation, but compliance costs can be financially draining.
<p>
According to a 1991 Tax Foundation report, small companies spent at least $382 in compliance costs for every $100 paid in taxes.
<p>
In addition, it's estimated that businesses squander 3.4 billion hours in tax-related paperwork. And the cost of compliance is big business; more than $200 billion is spent on complying with tax laws.
<p>
Forbes advocates a "pure" flat tax, while . Dole's vision of reform is a "fairer and simpler" type of system.
<p>
Bold tax reform efforts received a big boost from an economic soul mate of Forbes. Jack Kemp, chairman of the National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform, released a long-awaited report whose aim is to help guide and shape the debate to overhaul the system. With such high-profile attention given to the issue, tax reform is destined to become a major election-year issue.
<p>
Kemp's Tax Reform Commission begins the report by recommending to Congress and the president "that the current Internal Revenue Service Code be repealed in its entirety."
<p>
No mincing of words there. The principles guiding the new tax code would have to stand up to the TRC "tax test:"
<p><ul>
<li>Economic growth through incentives to work, save and invest;
<li> fairness for all taxpayers;
<li> neutrality that lets people and not government make choices;
<li> visibility to let people know the cost of government;
<li> stability so people can plan for the future.
</ul>
The TRC advocates that the "failed system" be replaced with a single low rate, taxing income only once with a generous personal exemption and full deductibility of the payroll tax.
<p>
The TRC stops short of advancing one type of tax system over another and does not suggest what the single low tax rate might be. (Forbes suggests a 17 percent rate starting at income above $36,800 for a family of four - below that income level, no taxes would be owed.)
<p>
To end the current tax code bias of rewarding consumption over saving and investing, the report says that the tax system "either must let savers deduct their saving or exclude the returns on the saving from their taxable income. It must also end double-taxation of businesses and their owners and permit expensing of investment outlays."
<p>
The report also recommends that capital gains taxes be abolished. Although the commission recognizes that estate and gift taxes make "little sense," it does not call for the elimination of such taxes, which prove particularly burdensome for family owned businesses.
<p>
The commission strongly endorses full deductibility of payroll taxes for employers and employees. If federal payroll taxes are tax-deductible, taxes would be determined on a worker's real net income.
<p>
Once a tax rate is set into place, the commission recommends that a two-thirds majority vote in Congress be required to raise taxes. For most tax reform advocates, this is critically important. As the law now stands, it only takes a majority vote in Congress to raise taxes and a supermajority to lower them.
<p>
Although many business organizations cheered the results of the TRC recommendations, most concluded that the real work lies ahead. The commission's report is not long on details, and the political realities of implementing such reforms depend on whether those in public office in 1997 will defend the current tax system by tinkering around the edges or totally dismantling it.

<h2>Rhetoric throttles aid for small businesses</h2>
by Karen Kerrigan
<P>
</center>
<hr><P>
While some people would have you believe otherwise,
the small-business provisions within the Contract With America
amounted to only minor changes.  Now, even the small-scale tax
and regulatory reforms proposed within the contract have been
watered down.
<P>
Many of the contract's key provisions, such as regulatory relief
and legal reform, have either died in the Senate or have been
put on the back burner until after the protracted budget battle.
<P>
Special-interest groups opposed to tax and budget cuts, as well
as reforms that would make bureaucrats more accountable, have
painted the contract as extreme.  Labor unions alone have pumped
more than $2 million into media ads to decry proposals that &quot;drastically
cut&quot; Medicare and pare back safeguards that protect worker
safety and the environment.
<P>
Medicare reform is a perfect example of how the public has swallowed
distorted ad campaigns without checking the facts.  According
to a recent survey by Public Opinion Strategies, most Americans
are woefully misinformed about the basic facts regarding Medicare
reform proposals.
<P>
Under the GOP plan, Medicare's budget would undergo a slower rate
of growth in spending than under current law.  In fact, if Medicare
reform were left up to the 1,000 Americans who responded to the
Public Opinion Strategies survey, reform opponents would have
had a severe problem on their hands.
<P>
For example, when it was explained that the GOP plan would increase
spending for Medicare by 45 percent over the next seven years
--- twice the projected rate of inflation --- 80 percent of those
polled believed the increase was too high.
<P>
The GOP plan increases spending per recipient from $4,800 to $7,100
over the next seven years.  But when asked what they thought the
GOP plan would do, 27 percent said that the plan would cut spending
below $4,000; 24 percent said spending would remain the same;
and only 22 percent most accurately portrayed the plan --- that
it would increase spending per recipient.
<P>
The problem, according to Medicare reform supporters, is that
the American public has been consistently exposed to misleading
ads and political rhetoric.
<P>
According to Pam Bailey, president of the Healthcare Leadership
Council and co-chair of the Coalition to Save Medicare, President
Clinton's plan was not very different from the GOP's.  Under the
plan approved by Congress, the government would spend $1.65 trillion
on Medicare over seven years.  Under the president's plan, it
would spend $1.682 trillion.
<P>
Political rhetoric can be blamed for the demise of many tax and
regulatory changes that would have benefited millions of small
businesses.   Interest groups supportive of the status quo were
quick to distort Republican proposals, which were supported by
many Democrats as well, as giveaways to big business.
<P>
Sure, big companies would have marginally benefited from the changes
proposed by Republicans.  But small businesses would have been
the main beneficiaries.
<P>
Small businesses will see <I>some</I> tax relief and incentives
soon, but according to most small-business groups, the results
are a big disappointment compared with original expectations.
 Small businesses can probably expect a $25,000 expensing provision,
a capital gains tax reduction and targeted estate tax relief for
family-owned businesses.  The final agreement, however, will mandate
that the tax provisions be phased in over seven years.
<P>
Home office users can say goodbye to efforts this year to clarify
the home-office deduction.  But on a more positive note, the self-employed
will see an increase from 30 percent to 50 percent in the amount
they can deduct for health-care expenses (phased in over seven
years).
<P>
Distortion and political rhetoric may help guardians of the status
quo avoid passing reforms that put the country back on a track
of fiscal stability, while helping millions of small business
owners and entrepreneurs create jobs.  But for these millions
of small business owners, the truth is generally reflected in
their bottom lines, which the government plays a big part in helping
or hindering.

<title>Kerrigan:  Balanced budget means bottom-line gains -- SBSC

<h2>Balanced budget means bottom-line gains</h2>
by Karen Kerrigan
<P>
</center>
<hr><P>
 &quot;Balanced budget means bottom-line gains&quot;
Will balancing the federal budget have a real
impact on our economy, or is it merely a populist issue that picks
up votes at the ballot box?
<P>
As Congress and President Clinton bicker over the details of a
seven-year plan to balance the budget, recent public opinion figures
still show widespread support for the effort.
<P>
An early November survey conducted by Alexandria-based Public
Opinion Strategies showed 83 percent of 1,000 registered voters
said it was important to balance the federal budget in the next
seven years.
<P>
At the same time, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin was predicting
wholesale chaos in the financial markets if Congress didn't increase
the federal debt limit.  But 69 percent of those surveyed said
the debt limit should not be increased without a balanced budget
in place.
<P>
Of course, the November deadline passed, Congress and the White
House reached a temporary agreement to re-open government after
a brief shutdown, the country's debt obligations are being paid
and the financial markets appear robust as ever.
<P>
In the end, you may ask:  Does a balanced budget really matter?
 And more importantly, how will a balanced federal budget affect
the livelihood of American families, businesses and individuals?
<P>
A recent crop of economic reports has concluded that balancing
the federal budget will have broad economic benefits and tangible
bottom-line gains for families, individuals and almost all sectors
of the American economy.
<P>
Economists at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank
in Washington, conclude that GOP plan to balance the budget --
with tax cuts -- will lead to greater business investment, higher
earnings per hour and faster economic growth than under current
law.
<P>
Heritage economists found the following would occur  with a balanced
budget in place:
<UL>
<LI>Gross Domestic Product would grow by $10.8 billion more than
under current law in the year 2002;
<LI>there would be an additional $32.1 billion in real disposable
income from 1995 through 2002;
<LI>there would be an additional $66.2 billion in consumption
expenditures from 1995 through 2002;
<LI>there would be an additional $88.2 billion in real non-residential
fixed investment from 1995 through 2002;
<LI>there would be and additional 104,000 housing starts from
1995 through 2002;
<LI>there would be a decrease of .4 percent in the conventional
mortgage rate --- meaning that a homeowner would save about $10,000
over the life of a $100,000, 30-year mortgage;
<LI>auto sales would increase by 600,000 units over the next seven
years --- that's $10 billion worth of cars.
</UL>


<P>
Another report has more good news.
<P>
With the government taking a smaller bite out of the economy,
interest rates should fall dramatically, according to the Senate
Joint Economic Committee.
<P>
A report from the Committee showed that a typical American family
could save nearly $1,800 a year in loan payments if the Republican
plan to balance the budget passes.
<P>
For example, a family with a $75,000 mortgage, a $15,000 auto
loan and an $11,000 student loan could save $1,800 a year if interest
rates drop just one percentage point.
<P>
The national debt of all consumer borrowing for home mortgages
and auto debt is $4.8 trillion --- a 1 percentage point drop in
interest rates would save more than $48 billion per year.
<P>
&quot;Clearly, the benefits of a balanced budget would extent
to all Americans,&quot; says Grover Norquist, president of Americans
for Tax Reform.  With the public still on the side of balancing
the budget, observers believe that the President will accept most
elements of the Republican plan.

<h2>Are union leader's tactics too divisive?</h2>
by Karen Kerrigan
<P>

</center><hr><P>
The power wielded by labor unions has deteriorated
in recent years.  Even labor officials admit their political clout
is not what it used to be.
<P>
Lower membership combined with labor officials' inability to aggressively
advance their agenda has caused severe rifts within the labor
movement.  These same factors led to the unprecedented election
of a new AFL-CIO president and probably will lead to more aggressive
organizing strategies.
<P>
On Oct. 25, John Sweeney - then president of the Service Employees
International Union (SEIU) --- defeated acting federation leader
Thomas Donahue for the AFL-CIO presidency.
<P>
Sweeney's win marked a historic moment for the AFL-CIO; his run
for the presidency was the only contested election in the federation's
40-year history.
<P>
As head of the SEIU, Sweeney increased its membership by 37 per
cent.  The SEIU under Sweeney also enjoyed a reputation for effective
organizing and activism --- points labor sees as critical to rebuilding
its political clout.
<P>
While Sweeney's performance at SEIU was striking in comparison
to other unions' activity, the methods used to bolster both its
membership and effectiveness have been questioned not only by
those who were the target of its tactics, but fellow union heads
as well.
<P>
During and after his election, Sweeney forcefully stated that
he will embrace civil disobedience and militancy &quot;if necessary.&quot;
 Sweeney found it necessary to use such tactics at the SEIU and,
based on his past success using such methods, is expected to employ
militant activism at the AFL-CIO.  Sweeney will also have a bigger
budget to work with.
<P>
While most unions spend about 5 percent of their budget on organizing
activities, the SEIU spends five times that amount.  Sweeney promised
to do the same at the AFL-CIO and committed $20 million of its
budget to union organizing efforts.
<P>
In addition to a strategy of funneling money directly to local
unions, Sweeney's goal is to train 1,000 union organizers over
the next two years to assist AFL-CIO members nationwide.
<P>
Metropolitan areas already have a taste for Sweeney's brand of
activism, and union watchers warn that businesses, as well as
local governments, should prepare for this larger campaign of
&quot;in your face&quot; activity.
<P>
For example, the SEIU and its local unions have tried to disrupt
businesses and local governments in the following manner:
<UL>
<LI>To protest cuts in Washington's budget, Justice for Janitors
(a campaign arm of the SEIU) blocked three main highways during
morning rush hour, delaying commuters for two hours.  Other cities
have also experienced this traffic tactic.
<LI>A Detroit SEIU Local protested the popular North American
International Auto Show because it &quot;portrays life in Detroit
as better than it actually is.&quot;
<LI>Noted real estate developers in major cities, including Atlanta
and Washington, have been targeted by the SEIU's Justice for Janitors
because their agenda demands they pay more of their &quot;fair
share&quot; of taxes.
</UL>

<P>
Sweeney has promised to use the &quot;corporate campaign&quot;
with greater frequency to get concessions at the collective bargaining
table that ordinarily would not be forthcoming without outside
pressure.
<P>
The strategies used by unions in corporate campaigns include targeting
a business with intense media pressure --- both earned media and
paid advertising; thwarting critical business plans by organizing
coalitions around their defeat; filing frivolous charges against
a business with government agencies (local, state and federal);
and helping to pass stock-holder resolutions that promote union
crusades.
<P>
The AFL-CIO and Sweeney can also count on the support of the Clinton
Administration and U.S. Labor Secretary Robert Reich to aid the
AFL-CIO's resuscitation and agenda.
<P>
Clearly, President Clinton must rebuild bridges with labor and
will show a marked interest in its agenda during the upcoming
election year.  Sweeney has promised to punish all elected officials
-- including Democrats -- who do not support labor's objectives.
<P>
Whether Sweeney will succeed in his new role is questionable at
best.  His grand promises to win labor back the political clout
it once had, while simultaneously adding 250,00 workers to its
membership rolls, appear to be a tough road indeed.
<P>
More importantly:  How much is Sweeney willing to alienate labor
from the general public through the use of militant tactics to
achieve short-term objectives?  Not all of labor's rank and file
agree with Sweeney's tactics.
<P>
As former AFL-CIO president Donahue stated in his keynote address
at the convention where he lost the election:  &quot;We must worry
less about building bridges to the rest of society.  We must enlist
the support of the public, not inconvenience as many as possible.&quot;
<P>
The acceleration of unions' decline could indeed quicken under
the AFL-CIO leadership of Sweeney if he chooses the opposite course.

<title>Kerrigan: Superfund Program Needs Its Own Cleanup -- SBSC</title>

<h2>Superfund Program Needs Its Own Cleanup</h2>
by Karen Kerrigan
<P>
</center>
<hr><P>
 
With broad-based regulatory relief probably on
hold for this year, members of Congress are selecting the most
egregious agencies and programs to reform.
<P>
Superfund  --  a super wast according to its critics  --  is one
such program that has been particularly troublesome to small businesses.
<P>
In its 15-year history, and despite tens of billions of dollars
of both private and public expenditures, only a fraction of the
waste sites targeted by the Environmental Protection Agency under
Superfund have actually been cleaned up.
<P>
The federal government has spent $10 billion on Superfund and
forced private parties to kick in another $80 billion.  According
to a 1994 report in BusinessWeek, only 49 out of 1270 waste sites
&quot;have been completely cleaned up.&quot;
<P>
In theory, the Superfund can be used to clean up a site on the
EPA's National Priority List.  The EPA then tracks down &quot;potentially
responsible parties&quot; and assigns responsibility for waste
site cleanups.
<P>
Often, though, the EPA forces parties to undertake the cleanup
from the start.  Noncompliance without &quot;sufficient cause&quot;
results in a fine of at least $25,000 per day.
<P>
Who are these responsible parties?  Superfund extends the liability
for cleanup to practically any entity that may have a disposed
of waste in the specified EPA site.
<P>
They include large and medium-sized companies.  But they also
include dry cleaners, automobile dealers, butcher shops, pizza
parlors and more.  Nonprofit groups and public entities have also
been caught in the Superfund web -- hospitals, schools and local
governments have been casts as polluters.
<P>
Here are a couple examples of small businesses put under the gun
by the EPA's Superfund program:
<P>
&#183; Formal Ware Rental Services of Tulsa, Okla., was notified
by the EPA that it would be held responsible for the cleanup of
a local Superfund site because it paid someone $14 in 1972 to
haul trash to the site.
<P>
&#183; Bob Novak, owner of the Jolly Butcher Shop, had to fork
over $11,000 originally destined for store improvements, because
the glue from cardboard boxes that he shipped to Ludlow Sanitary
Landfill in New York was deemed hazardous.
<P>
The current liability scheme remains the root of the problem,
according to critics who want to overhaul Superfund.  In determining
liability, the EPA uses illogical criteria.
<P>
Superfund, for example, allows for strict liability that holds
parties accountable regardless of intent or negligence.  The liability
is also retroactive, meaning actions taken before the law was
enacted still apply.  Even if firms were in full compliance of
the law prior to 1980, Superfund still exposes them to liability.
<P>
Joint and several liability also applies under Superfund.  Therefore,
the EPA can require that one business pay for the entire cleanup,
without regard to the degree of its own contribution to the waste
site and without total consideration tot the total number of contributors.
<P>
No concept of fair share exists under Superfund.  A business targeted
 by the EPA for cleanup naturally files lawsuits against other
businesses connected to the waste site.  All parties then tend
to turn to their insurance companies for reimbursement.
<P>
In addition, the type of waste disposed of by a firm is not factored
into the liability scheme.  A firm depositing fairly innocuous
materials may still be held liable.
<P>
Lawyers benefit handsomely from the Superfund quagmire.  It's
claimed that as much as one-third of Superfund money pays for
legal fees alone.  
<P>
Several congressional committees, including the House Small Business
Committee, are starting their hearings on Superfund reform.
<P>
The &quot;Superfund Liability Equity and Acceleration Act,&quot;
which repeals the law's retroactive liability provisions and replaces
the joint and several liability standard, was recently introduced.
 Parties will be held liable for the amount they contributed and
no more.
<P>
Small businesses and taxpayers may begin to rest easier at night
knowing that the weekly task of putting out the garbage may be
less of a liability with forthcoming congressional action.  Perhaps
the environment will actually get cleaned up as well.

<title>Kerrigan:  Capital Gains Tax Cut Needs Inflation Hedge -- SBSC</title>
</HEAD>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">

<center>
<i>October 1995</i>
<hr>
<h2> Capital Gains Tax Cut Needs Inflation Hedge</h2>
by Karen Kerrigan
<P>
</center>
<hr><P>
A cut in the capital gains tax is almost assured
this year.  Both the House and Senate are committed to the reduction,
and despite President Clinton's &quot;tax cuts for the rich&quot;
rhetoric, even he has hinted at supporting a capital gains tax
cut.  The House has passed legislation reducing the capital gains
tax from its current top level of 28 percent to 19.8 percent and
indexing the rate for inflation.  The measure calls for prospective
indexing (calculated from Jan. 1, 1995) on assets held for at
least three years.
<P>
It's expected that the Senate will pass a similar bill calling
for a 50 percent exclusion on capital gains income.  However,
it's unknown whether the Senate's version will allow taxpayers
to index for inflation.
<P>
According to investment experts and economists who favor cutting
(and eliminating) capital gains taxes, a huge expanse exists between
non-indexed and indexed capital gains tax rates.
<P>
Inflations can be a tax in itself by eroding purchasing power,
savings and investments.  The current nominal capital gains tax
rate is 28 percent.  However, when inflation is factored into
the capital gains equation, the real capital gains tax rate rises
substantially.
<P>
For example, on an investment with a one-year return of 10 percent,
assuming a 3 percent inflation rate, the non-indexed 28 percent
capital gains tax rate jumps to an inflation-adjusted rate of
40 percent.
<P>
Even with the proposed non-indexed rate of 19.8 percent, the real
rate on such an investment leaps to 28.3 percent.  And if inflation
reaches 5 percent, the rate doubles from 19.8 percent to 39.6
percent.
<P>
&quot;Lower rates of return and/or higher rates of inflation will
translate into even higher real capital gains tax rates,&quot;
says Ray Keating, chief economist of the Small Business Survival
Foundation.  &quot;These real capital gains tax rates act as severe
disincentives to investment and entrepreneurship,&quot; Keating
adds.
<P>
Without indexation, the government ends up taxing illusory profits.
 In fact, some individuals can wind up paying taxes on real capital
losses.  That is, after factoring for inflation, a nominal profit
on a transaction can turn out to be a real loss, yet the investor
still pays taxes on the nominal gain.
<P>
An investor's willingness to invest is substantially hindered
by taxing capital gains.  According to Keating and other economists,
indexation would eliminate inflation as a factor in capital gains
determination  --  equalizing stated and real capital gains tax
rate.
<P>
The lower real rate would reduce uncertainty and generate investment,
economic growth and job creation.
<P>
If non-indexation is so unfair, they why isn't its passage guaranteed
as part of a capital gains tax reduction?  The apparent roadblocks
are money and complexity.
<P>
Although history has shown that reducing capital gains tax rates
actually yields higher revenue for the U.S. Treasury, budget leaders
in the Senate are advocating an agenda of &quot;revenue neutrality&quot;
 -- meaning that for every dollar of tax cuts, a dollar of spending
cuts must be enacted in order to balance the budget by 2002.
<P>
Accordingly, indexing capital gains tax rates for inflation will
cost the government more money, meaning political leaders will
have to cut spending more deeply.
<P>
Opponents also claim that indexing is too complicated for taxpayers
to figure out.  In reality, indexation would require merely one
additional step of multiplication for taxpayers.
<P>
&quot;If taxpayers in Great Britain and Australia can deal with
indexing, I'm sure U.S. taxpayers can as well,&quot; responds
Keating.  Keating adds that if the complexity of indexation is
so troubling to our elected officials, then the most simple reform
is still available -- elimination of the capital gains tax.
<P>
Since late last year, investors have been counting on the capital
gains tax proposal offered by the House.  According to investment
experts, the failure to deliver on the tax cut would be a blow
to capital markets.
<P>
Keating points out that start-up and high-growth companies would
particularly be hurt, noting that the potential returns on high-risk
investments would be lower --- therefore, so would equity prices.
 Trillions of dollars of locked-up capital would not be available
for investment opportunities.
<P>
Venture capital, whether raised from one's family and friends
or from professional investors, remains a critical source of funding
for entrepreneurial  enterprises.
<P>
More often than not, small-business funding comes from someone
the entrepreneur knows.
<P>
Although lowering capital gains tax rates provides an additional
incentive to investors in prospective high-risk ventures, inflation
still remains a silent force working against an entrepreneurial
boom.
<P>
With a new majority in Congress advocating &quot;tax fairness,&quot;
indexing capital gains for inflation is not only fair, but good
for economic growth as well.

<title>SBB:  Spectrum Auctions Could Help Lower Deficit</title>
</head>

<h2>Spectrum Auctions Could Help Lower Deficit</h2>
                                                     </center>
<hr>

October 1995 --  The communications revolution has played a pivotal role in how America does business and impacts the personal lives of most Americans.  As Congress looks for ways to reduce the federal deficit, a debate has surfaced over the use of our nation's airwaves -- otherwise known as the "spectrum." 
<P>
Only twenty years ago, the average person could probably only identify a few uses of the spectrum -- namely broadcast television and  radio.  With technological advancements, though, have come more uses of the spectrum.  For example satellite TV, wireless computer networks and cellular phones all utilize the nation's airwaves.  And, the technological boom has caused the spectrum to jump in value.
<P>
Recognizing a handsome revenue source for the federal government, Congress in 1993 mandated that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) auction all licenses for new spectrum uses.   Recent auctions for the Personal Communications Services spectrum have raised more than $8 billion.  And, as budgetary pressures continue to bear down on the 104th Congress, spectrum auctions are being closely examined because of their revenue potential.
<P>
House and Senate Commerce Committees in the 104th Congress have been charged with raising $14 billion to help balance the budget by 2002.  Over the past several weeks, congressional hearings have revealed several areas that can be targeted to meet these tight revenue requirements.
<P>
A controversial but lucrative target for auctions are the airwaves now set-a-side for television broadcasters to develop high-definition television (HDTV).  In 1991, the FCC allocated six megahertz of extra spectrum for the broadcasters to make the transition to HDTV.  
<P>
After the switch, the broadcasters would then hand back their current channel, now used for analog TV transmission.  	But technology and the market outsmarted bureaucrats in Washington.  With technological gains, broadcasters can now provide digital (but not high definition) television utilizing a fraction of the airwaves.  In other words, rather than providing just one channel of HDTV, the broadcasters have the capability for multiple channels of digital television, while leaving space for other lucrative services.      
    
<P>
While the broadcasters still maintain that they will continue to develop HDTV with the allocated airwaves, they have also asked for "spectrum flexibility."
<P>
The flexibility will allow them to use the extra airwaves for any number of telecommunications services:  Six new channels of television, or 72 compact-disc quality radio signals, or cellular phone services, or interactive data services, or they can mix and match.
<P>
This proposal, however, does not sit well with telecommunication companies that have been required to purchase airwaves through auctions.  They view spectrum flexibility for broadcasters as a special government giveaway.
<P>
In a recent letter to Congress, the president of Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association (CTIA), Thomas A. Wheeler, expressed "shock and dismay as the broadcasters seek to ram through the Congress a special deal" that allows them to obtain new spectrum for free, while the wireless industry has had to pay $8 billion.
<P>
Like the broadcasters, members of CTIA did receive their initial spectrum allocation for free, but all subsequent wireless telecommunications spectrum has been acquired through auctions.    The broadcasters claim that they have been singled out, and the government has plenty of warehoused spectrum that should be auctioned off first before the broadcasting industry is disrupted.
<P>
The broadcasters also weigh in with their public-service responsibilities as an argument to exempt them from auctions.  And, they claim financial hardship in competing with other telecommunication industry players.
<P>
"If the spectrum earmarked for the transition to digital is auctioned, it will destroy the ability of local television stations to stay in business as the communications market moves to digital technology," Robert Wright, CEO of NBC, told the Senate Commerce Committee.     
<P>
Faye Anderson, Executive Director of the Council of 100, a national network of African-American Republicans, questions the broadcasters' claim of financial hardship, and the assertion that the government is sitting on a valuable reserve of spectrum.
<P>
Anderson points to the multi-billion dollar deals involving Disney's purchase of ABC/Cap Cities, and Westinghouse's bid for CBS to counter the argument that the broadcasters will not be able to compete in spectrum auctions because of a lack of capital.
<P>
Just how much money can be raised from the sale of the HDTV airwaves?    According to John Reidy, a managing director at the brokerage firm Smith Barney, Inc., who testified before the Senate Commerce Committee, $30 billion could go to the U.S. Treasury from the auctions.  Other experts say $30 billion is conservative.
<P>
With other important matters budgetary matters before Congress (such Medicare and welfare reform), industry observers and advocacy organizations are carefully following the spectrum issue as a barometer for "true change" in the Congress.

<title>SBB: Maximum Opposition to Minimum Wage Increase </title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><center><h2> Maximum Opposition to Minimum Wage Increase </h2>                                                     </center><hr>



September 1995 - Almost three years ago, then presidential candidate Bill Clinton stated that increasing the minimum wage is "the wrong way to raise the incomes of low-wage earners."  The wrong way back then, but the right way now as increasing the minimum wage is viewed as a politically popular strategy to reconnect with the Democrat's traditional base of working class Americans.
<P>
While most economists agree that minimum wage increases do more economic harm than good (both for workers and the economy), President Clinton has proposed a 21 percent increase from $4.25 to $5.15 an hour.
<P>
Democratic party leaders in the Congress are also working feverishly to include a minimum wage hike into welfare reform proposals, presumably to be acted upon this fall.
<P>
Studies conducted over the past 25 years have consistently concluded that with each 10 percent increase in the minimum wage, a corresponding 1 percent to 2 percent decline in entry-level employment results.  The General Accounting Office, the Brookings Institution, the Employment Policies Institute Foundation, the Congressional Budget Office and various Presidential Commission's have all reached this universal conclusion.
<P>
Even the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC), the "New Democrat" organization once led by the President, declared that "the minimum wage can be allowed to fade into history."
    <P>
As minimum wage hike proponents pose the issue as improving the living wage of lower-income workers, most businesses and their workers view minimum wage jobs as entry-level positions -- by which the majority of workers gain skills to move onto higher-paying work.
<P>
An independent study in 1992 demonstrated that within a 12 month period, 63 percent of American workers at the minimum wage earned higher wages.   Not surprisingly, about half of minimum wage employees were either young adults under the age of 21, or teenagers.
<P>
According to a study by The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think-tank in Washington, D.C., raising the minimum wage emotionally appeals to most Americans, but doing it would be a mistake.
<P>
According to the foundation study:
<P><ul>
<li>Raising the minimum wage will harm the nonworking poor by raising prices and destroying entry-level job opportunities.
<li>Raising the minimum wage does not generally help low-income households -- the increased income from minimum wage jobs would mostly go to families far above the poverty level, not to poor minimum wage workers.
<li>Employers will respond to a minimum wage increase by cutbacks in hiring, reducing workers' hours, or lowering pay and benefits and skipping pay raises -- responses that hurt, not help, workers.
<li>A $5.15 increase in the minimum wage will result in approximately 400,000 lost entry-level jobs.  A wage increase may result in more skilled workers being enticed into the job market, but fewer unskilled job opportunities (entry-level jobs) would be available.</ul>         
<P>
Grant Maloy, a small business operator from Orlando, Fl., testified earlier in the year before the Joint Economic Committee on the President's proposal to raise the minimum wage.  As the owner of a wholesale foliage nursery, Maloy stated that his industry pays $5.24 for entry-level work, well above the minimum wage.
<P>
"Wages have increased because of pressure both within the industry and from other industries, as well as the need to keep quality employees.  How is it possible that one central government can know what millions of businesses can afford to pay?  The answer is they can't," says Maloy.
<P>
According to Maloy, minimum wage policy is insincere.  While the government expects a business owner to pay a minimum wage, the owner himself may be making much less.  Maloy estimated that he was making about $2.00 an hour when he started his business.
<P>
Surveys of the American public continue to show widespread support for increasing the minimum wage, and in 1989 Congress overwhelmingly backed the last minimum wage increase -- more than 90 percent voted in favor of the hike.
<P>
Political experts agree that if a proposal to increase the minimum wage makes its way to the House or Senate floor for a vote, it may pass.  No member in Congress wants to be labeled as "anti-worker" despite the widespread research showing the negative effects of increasing the minimum wage on those it purportedly is supposed to help.
<P>
On the other hand, the public's dissatisfaction with Washington and misguided government attempts to solve every problem may indeed resonate with the minimum wage issue as well.
<P>
More importantly however, is how the public will view the President's proposal.  Is the President proposing to raise the minimum wage to truly help the working poor?  Or will the public perceive his proposal as a political ploy to gain votes in 1996.
<P>
What remains certain though, is the growing universal belief that the minimum wage does little for increasing job opportunities for those who need it most.

<h2>FDA's Stubborn Inefficiency is Killing Business and Jobs</h2>                                                 </center>
<HR>
September 1995 -- The 104th Congress is leaving no stone unturned in terms of its examination of federal government agencies.  OSHA, EPA, IRS, FBI, ATF, EEOC, and other agencies are being probed for inefficiency and counterproductive impact on American business.
<P>
Included in this review is the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -- long held in high regard by the American public.
<P>
The FDA has squandered its goodwill with the industries it regulates, as well as with patient groups and politicians from Democratic and Republican camps for its growing inefficiency and unaccountability.  One major criticism, concerns FDA's severe shortcomings in approving new drugs and medical devices.
<P>
Breakthrough medical devices, for example, face lengthy approval times.  Although FDA guidelines maintain that the approval process is supposed to be completed within 180 days, independent studies have revealed that actual approval periods take anywhere from 437 to 840 days.
<P>
In testimony before the House Joint Economic Committee in 1994, Robert DeHaven of the American Electronics Association (AEA) testified that the FDA's "inordinately slow" regulatory process was threatening "the global competitiveness" of the medical device industry -- a $70 billion industry with more than 11,000 companies.
<P>
A recent survey conducted by the AEA found that 40 percent of medical device firms reduced their number of U.S. employees because of FDA delays, 29 percent boosted investment in foreign operations, and 22 percent moved U.S. jobs out of the country.
<P>
Robert Higgs, in a report for the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI), notes that medical technology firms invested about $321-$333 million abroad annually from 1989 to 1991.  In 1992, though, "when the FDA abruptly made its enforcement and approval policies more onerous, capital outflow jumped more than 200 percent to $993 million."  
<P>
Along with the export of capital to international shores goes American innovation, entrepreneurship, high-paying jobs and our best growth industries say critics.
<P>
"The FDA seems more intent on exporting American ingenuity and entrepreneurship, rather than encouraging the production of U.S.-made drugs and medical devices," says Raymond Keating, chief economist with the Small Business Survival Committee.
<P>
U.S. pharmaceutical companies also face the same regulatory maze and bureaucratic gridlock as medical device companies.  Although established drug companies have learned how to deal with the FDA's red tape, longer approval periods mean higher development costs, which translate into higher drug prices for consumers.
<P>
Between 1986 and 1993, the median approval time for generic drug applications increased from 12 months to 38 months.  These time periods exclude FDA requirements placed on firms that extend development time.
<P>
In a study conducted by researchers at Tufts University for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America,  drugs originating here often are available in foreign markets many years before becoming availability in the U.S.  For example, of all drugs approved in the U.S., 12 percent had been available in foreign markets for six to 10 years, and another 9 percent for more than a decade.
<P>
Despite the drug approval lag, safety does not appear to be enhanced in the U.S.  According to the Tufts study, although Great Britain gets drugs to market quicker that the U.S., safety discontinuations as a percentage of total new drug introductions are similar in each country -- 4 percent in Great Britain and 3 percent in the U.S.
<P>
As reports and criticism mount against the FDA, its staff and defenders contend that the agency is in dire need of more funds to keep up with its workload.  A look at the FDA's budget growth over the years shows that from 1989 to 1994, real FDA budget authority increased by 52.6 percent -- or by an average annual real rate of more than 10.5 percent.  FDA's 1994 budget was just more than $900 million.
<P>
During those same years, the number  of employees grew by a substantial 25.3 percent, totaling more than 9,000.   Critics claim American taxpayers are paying more to get less.
<P>
Of course, a multitude of other industries are impacted by FDA regulation:  food, cosmetic, restaurant, retail druggist, manufacturers of medical devices and now the tobacco  industry has its own gripes about the FDA's heavy-handedness.
<P>
The key for Congress is balancing the concerns of the American public that the FDA preserve and protect the public health, with the concerns of business that the FDA's inefficiency has gone to far -- costing Americans jobs, as well as access to breakthrough drugs and medical devices.
<P>
Critics claim that FDA Commissioner Dr. David Kessler has spent too much time on aggressive enforcement and investigation of businesses rather than cooperating with the industries he regulates to move the approval process along in a timely manner.
<P>
Former FDA officials also cite Commissioner Kessler's obsession with regulating tobacco at the expense of other agency responsibilities.   A former chief FDA investigator sent a letter to the U.S. House Commerce Committee stating that, for example, the FDA's foreign inspection program was a "disaster waiting to happen."
<P>
According to a Washington, D.C. newspaper, the same official said that he attempted to meet with and contact Kessler several times on important matters " and was told by his secretary that if my topic was anything other than cigarettes, the commissioner would have no time for me."        
<P>
    With the FDA under attack from industry, Congress and patients groups who want faster approval times for life-saving drugs and medical devices, the agency may begin to change course and reinvent itself.   However, under mounting criticism from these constituencies, Congress itself may devise an FDA reform bill that forces  Kessler and his staff to put their time and resources into more productive efforts that save lives, American jobs and entire industries.

<title>Time to cut the fat out of Davis-Bacon Act</title>
</head>

<h2>Time to cut the fat out of Davis-Bacon Act</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
August 1995 - Early this summer, the National Policy Forum, a Washington-based
Republican think tank, released its Agenda for Small Business  --- a seven-point plan to ensurethe vitality and prosperity of the small-business, entrepreneurial sector.  The plan includes tax and regulatory relief, capital access measures, tort reform and several other proposals near and dear to small business.<p>
Item No. 7 on NPF's agenda is a very specific reform aimed at helping small businesses compete for federally funded construction projects.  It calls for the elimination of the Davis-Bacon Act.<p>
The Davis-Bacon Act mandates that a "prevailing wage" be paid to all workers on
federally funded construction projects in excess of $2,000.  The U.S. Department of Labor sets these wage rates for thousands of job classifications in scores of regions across the country.<p>
The Coalition to Repeal Davis-Bacon, a coalition of nearly 70 organizations ranging from the National School Boards Association to Citizens Against Government Waste, claims that prevailing wage rates are vastly inflated and generally reflect union rates.<p>
And the Congressional Budget Office estimated in 1995 that the Davis-Bacon act raises construction costs by at least $2.7 billion over five years.<p>
What's more, according to David Thompson, a Washington attorney specializing in labor law, Davis-Bacon creates an artificial market in which only large companies can compete.<p>
"Excessive paperwork requirements, arbitrary work rules and classifications and bloatedpay scales block access for small companies.  The law creates an unrealistic environment in which small local companies cannot afford to participate," says Thompson.<p>
Union leaders say wage rates set by the Labor Department do reflect market wage rates.  However, an investigative report done by the state of Oklahoma suggests that the wage surveying process itself may be corrupt.<p>
The report concludes that fraudulent wage data was submitted to the U.S. Department of Labor to "influence the outcome of U.S. Department of Labor wage surveys and, consequently, to take advantage of the taxpayers."<p>
In the voluntary wage-surveying process, any group or individual can submit completed
projects to help the Labor Department make its wage decisions.  In one example of fraud, asurvey claimed that 20 employees, compensated at $21.05 per hour, worked on a $2 million underground storage tank.  The investigation found that tank was never built.<p>
According to Oklahoma officials, if this type of fraudulent practice is occurring in one
place, it's probably occurring in others.<p>
"The prevailing wage law is premised on the false assumption that the government can
accurately determine what wage is prevailing.  There's no reasonable way to obtain true
prevailing wage information and therefore the entire system must be scrapped," says Ike Casey, executive vice president of Independent Electrical Contractors Inc.<p>
Members of Congress who support repealing Davis-Bacon contend that the market is the best determinant of wage rates.  That's why efforts for repeal are quickly moving through the House and Senate.  Senator Nancy Kassebaum (R-Kan.) has pushed a repeal bill through the Labor and Human Resources Committee, while legislation moving through the House is on an identical track.<p>
Repealing the Davis-Bacon will not be easy.  Labor unions and other beneficiaries of
Davis-Bacon will aggressively lobby Congress with a very effective argument  --- a vote to repeal Davis-Bacon is a vote to "cut our wages."<p>
Labor unions believe keeping Davis-Bacon is in all workers' interest, while supporters of
repeal feel it protects a privileged few at the expense of taxpayers.<p>

<title>A New Test For Independent Contractors</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<center>
<h2>A New Test For Independent Contractors</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
August 1995 - There is plenty about the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that raises the ire of small business owners and entrepreneurs.  The 20-factor test utilized by the IRS to delineate between independent contractors and employees is one such issue causing both confusion and agitation.<p>
Clarifying the status of independent contractors has long been a concern for small
businesses and the self-employed.  The need for the IRS to provide a more concise, objective standard for independent contractors was the priority issue voted on by thousands of delegates at The White House Conference on Small Business earlier this summer.<p>
Rep. Linda Smith (R-Wash.), chairman of the Subcommittee on Taxation and Finance of the Small Business Committee, recently held hearings on the complexity of the issue as well as proposed legislation to amend the criteria used by the IRS.<p>
"For too long, the IRS has been retarding job growth and business expansion because of fear it will re-classify independent contractors as employees," said Smith in announcing her hearings.<p>
Rep. Jon Christensen (R-Neb.) agrees with Rep. Smith, and testified on legislation he
sponsored, the Independent Contractor Tax Simplification Act -- a bill to modify and simplify the 20-factor test.<p>
"Almost everyone will agree that the 20-factor test is unclear and far too subjective.  It is quite possible to take two seemingly identical situations and find employee status in one, and independent contractor in another.  Nevertheless, in recent years the IRS has bludgeoned small businesses over the head with the 20-factor test," said Christensen.<p>

     Indeed many individuals who prefer to work as independent contractors have had their status challenged by the IRS.  Even though it may be an individual's choice to work autonomously, the test used by the IRS may re-classify them as an employee, causing back-taxes and penalties for the business contracting with the individual.<p> 
According to one recent study, the IRS has reclassified 439,000 independent workers
since the mid-1980s, resulting in the collection of $678 million in taxes and fines.  The IRS simply states that it is only doing a very tough job -- it attributes about $2 billion in lost revenues to employers who wrongly misclassify workers.<p>
Christensen's bill would not eliminate the 20-factor test, but simply provides an
alternative for those who comply with all income reporting requirements.  Rather than attempting to determine who is an employee, Christensen's legislation defines who is not an employee.<p>
"It establishes distinct, clear and objective criteria for those seeking to perform services as an independent contractor," says Christensen.<p>
The three-part test established by Christensen requires that an independent contractor
demonstrate independence, investment in his or her business, and a written agreement between the parties.<p>
While Part Three of the test, Contract, is easy to establish, demonstrating independence and investment each have several sub-tests.  The independent contractor is required to meet only one criterion of the sub-tests to satisfy that portion of the test. <p>  
For example, Part One of the three-part test is Investment.  The individual would have to satisfy one of the following sub-tests to satisfy Part One.  Does the individual:<p>
(1)  have a significant investment in training or assets; or<br>
(2)  incur significant unreimbursed expenses; or<br>
(3)  agree to work for a specific time or complete a specific result, and is liable for<br>
damages for failure to perform; or<br>
(4)  receive compensation primarily on a commission basis; or<br>
(5)  purchase a product for resale?<p>     
Under Part Two of the test, the independent contractor would also be required to meet 
one of several subtests to satisfy his or her independence.  <p>
If, however, the independent contractor and the business for whom services are being
provided do not comply with income reporting rules, the 20-factor test would apply to their business relationship.<p>
Acknowledging problems with worker classification, the IRS has developed reforms of
its own to deal with the controversial issue.  On August 2, it released a set of initiatives.<p>
"I've spent a lot of time talking with small businesses who believe this is a big
problem...We can do better, and will do better in handling worker classification issues," said IRS Commissioner Margaret Richardson in a statement.<p>
In order to improve the administration of worker classification, the IRS would provide
greater training for their auditors, consolidate the review process when employers challenge the status of worker determinations, and better coordinate national enforcement to ensure consistency of worker classification by industry and region.  Anything else, says the IRS, can only be implemented through legislation.<p>
Critics contend the IRS initiatives are weak and meaningless.<p>
"I'm very concerned that the administrative programs the IRS may wish to strengthen, are actually part of the problem because there are still no clear rules for implementing them," said Chairman Smith.<p>
As technology and corporate downsizing continue to shape the independent workforce, the IRS will eventually be forced to simplify and clarify the status of independent contractors.  If the IRS doesn't, it will literally take an act of Congress to change the bias against independent contractors.  That change, is well under way.<p>

<title>OSHA Has Forgotten its Original Purpose</title>

<h2>OSHA Has Forgotten its Original Purpose</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
July 1995 - Business owners who've experienced an OSHA inspection get very emotional when talking about the government agency whose job it is to ensure that America's workplaces are safe and hazard-free.  According to many of these businesses, inspectors create a no-win situation by playing a "gothcha-game," with OSHA finding fault no matter how safe the work environment.<p>
Critics of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) claim that the agency has
completely turned away from advising on, and promoting workplace safety and health.  OSHA, claims business, is a complete adversary of business.<p>
According to Rep. Cass Ballenger (R-NC), Chairman of the Workforce Protections
Committee of the U.S. House Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities, OSHA's mission is enforcement driven -- find violations and issue penalties.<p>  
"In my view, nothing illustrates how OSHA has gone off the track more clearly than the
fact that today few, if any, employers would ever call OSHA and ask for assistance or advice on workplace safety or health," said Ballenger when introducing H.R. 1834, an OSHA reform bill. <p>
Called the "Safety and Health Improvement and Regulatory Act of 1995," Ballenger
thoroughly aims to change the way OSHA operates.<p>
A key reform of H.R. 1834 allows businesses to correct violations found by OSHA,
without paying a penalty when the citation is issued.  If a business fails to take corrective action, only then will a fine result -- not the situation today.<p>   
"It does not matter whether the violation is not threatening to any employees.  Nor does it matter whether the employer knew of the regulation -- he or she is presumed to know all of what is printed in the Federal Register, and the unending "compliance directives" from Washington," said Ballenger.<p>
Many businesses hire OSHA consultants in preparation for an inspection.  Even so,
inspectors generally find something wrong and a monetary fine is usually issued.  This is unfair according to Ballenger, and under his plan OSHA will work with employers to identify and correct hazards.<p>
Ballenger's subcommittee recently began holding hearings on OSHA reform, and heard from both supporters and detractors of  H.R. 1834.  Business organizations were extremely supportive of the measure, while representatives from organized labor were not pleased.<p>
Thomas Donahue, Secretary-Treasurer of the AFL-CIO ripped apart the measure by
calling it a "cruel and regressive measure that puts workers' lives in danger."<p>
"It [H.R. 1834] presumes that employers will act responsibly on their own, without
government oversight or intervention, in the best interest of workers, despite a long history demonstrating this not be the case for many employers," testified Donahue.<p>
Ballenger's bill does not remove enforcement, but shifts the balance 50-50 with non-enforcement efforts to be phased-in over three years.<p>
Expansion of non-enforcement programs in H.R. 1834 include:<p>
<ul>
<li>State consultation grant programs for on-site assistance to small businesses in high hazard industries.
<li>Increasing OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program (VPP)  -- which recognizes employers with exemplary safety programs and records, and grants exemptions from enforcement inspections.
<li>An emphasis on training and education to promote safe work practices for both
employers and employees.
<li>A new certification program to allow individuals to conduct workplace inspections.  A
business would not be inspected by OSHA as long as the business remained 
accident-free and had no employee complaints.<p></ul>
The Clinton Administration has also heard an earful from both employers and members
of Congress regarding OSHA's heavy hand.  In response to political pressure, and criticism from the business community, OSHA lowered financial penalty rates that were vastly increased by Labor Secretary Robert Reich.  OSHA assistant secretary Joseph Dear will not pursue controversial ergonomic rules which the agency has been preparing for years.<p>  
And, the Administration has put forward its own reform initiative that would "reinvent"
OSHA.  While recognizing the need for changes in OSHA, President Clinton believes
Republican plans go way beyond reform. <p>
"They're [Republicans] not trying to reform the system of worker protection as we are,
but instead to dismantle it," said Clinton.<p>
The Congress is scheduled to have more hearings on OSHA reform -- not soon enough for business groups who must deal with sometimes silly and outrageous regulations. <p>
The National Roofing Contractors Association (NRCA), for example, has its own top-ten list of "favorite" roofing regulations.  Eight out of ten are OSHA inflicted.  For example, OSHA's rules:<p>
<ul>
<li>Prohibits gum chewing while roofing. 
<li>Require the posting of signs saying respirators are required even when they are not. 
<li>Require employers to train employees on hazards of exposure to deadly materials like chalk, lumber and dishwashing detergent.
<li>Fines employer if a roofer smokes on the job. <p></ul>
...and the list continues.<p>
According to Washington business leaders, the time has come to reform OSHA.  Craig
Brightup, Vice President of Government Relations at NRCA, says changes are long overdue.<p>
"Over the past 20 years, the very foundation of OSHA has held business completely in
the pejorative. They believe business cannot be trusted to implement meaningful health and safety programs themselves, and this is simply not true," says Brightup.<p>   
According to Brightup, H.R. 1834 is designed to reward and support businesses who
make a good faith effort, which most employers do.
While everyone, except organized labor, believe OSHA must be reformed, the question
remains as to how far the President will go to make the agency less burdensome.  With the '96 election cycle moving quickly upon us, the Administration needs the support of labor at the ballot box making business groups wary of the President's intentions.<p>

<title>Is It Time to Eliminate the Commerce Department?</title>
</head>
<center>
<h2>Is it Time to Eliminate the Commerce Department?</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
July 1995 - Former Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher recently referred to his old Department as "nothing more than a hall closet where you throw in everything that you don't know what to do with."  Presumably, Washington budget-cutters agree and have decided that its time to clean out the Department of Commerce's closet. <p>
The U.S. House and Senate recently passed balance budget resolutions that would erase the deficit in seven years.   The budget-cutting ax has been broadly wielded, cutting and eliminating many government programs and agencies which have traditionally  benefitted American business.  The Department of Commerce is one such program targeted for elimination by both the House and Senate budget plans.<p>
The Commerce Department has long been a target of conservative budget cutters who see the department as wasteful, inefficient and duplicative of other programs.<p>
The government's own watchdog agency, the Government Accounting Office (GAO),
uncharitably describes Commerce as well.  GAO reports that the department "faces the most complex web of divided authorities" sharing its "mission with at least 71 federal department, agencies and offices."  More than 60 percent of its budget is allotted to programs entirely unrelated to its mission.<p>
Legislation proposed in the House and Senate would eliminate most  of Commerce, while transferring, consolidating and privatizing its useful functions.  Rep. Dick Chrysler (R-Mich.) recently introduced "The Department of Commerce Dismantling Act of 1995" in the House, while Sens. Spencer Abraham (R-Mich.) and Lauch Faircloth (R-NC) introduced a companion bill in the Senate.<p>
"This is not just a reckless effort to slash programs for the sake of cutting government," said Chrysler.  Chrysler chaired a three month effort in the House to study and examine the Commerce Department.<p>
"If we found that a program was duplicative, we consolidated it.  If a program was better performed by the private sector, we privatized it.  If it was beneficial, we streamlined it," added Chrysler.<p>
In addition, programs found wasteful were eliminated.  The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that both Senate and House Commerce Department elimination measures would save taxpayers more than $7.765 billion over five years.<p>
What parts of Commerce would be eliminated, while others salvaged under the
Department of Commerce Dismantling Act of 1995?  Highlights include:<p>
<ul>
<li>Administrative functions of Commerce and the Office of the Secretary, General Counsel and Inspector General -- eliminated.  <b>Estimated savings -- $250 million.</b>
<li>Minority Business Development Agency -- eliminated.  Found to be duplicative of the functions of the Small Business Administration and private sector.<b>  Estimated savings -- $1.139 billion.</b>
<li>United States Travel and Tourism Administration -- eliminated.  Promotional activities already considered performed by the private sector, states, localities and public sector organizations.<b>  Estimated savings -- $75 million.</b>
<li>Technology Administration.  Gone are programs that specifically fund applied research  programs, and invest taxpayer dollars in new technology promotion.  The National Technical Information Service is privatized while the weights and measure functions of the National Institutes for Standards and Technology is transferred to the National Science Foundation.<b> Estimated Savings -- $1.872 billion.</b>
<li>Patent and Trade Office.  Transferred to Justice Department and supported through fees.<b>Estimated Savings -- $375 million.</b>
<li>Economic and Statistics Administration.  Bureau of Census transferred to Justice.  Bureau of Economic Analysis transferred to the Federal Reserve System. <b> Estimated Savings: $827 million.</b>
<li>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which accounts for more than 40 percent of Commerce's budget, would have its various functions privatized and
transferred to more appropriate agencies. <b> Estimated savings:  $2.338 billion.</b>
<li>Export and Trade Administration functions would largely be transferred to the Office of Trade Representative while other miscellaneous duties eliminated.  <b>Estimated savings -- $385 million.</b></ul><p>                   
The threat of closing Commerce's door has not brought with it a firestorm of protest from the Washington business lobby.  While some business leaders see the elimination of Commerce as the price to pay for a more fiscally sound government, others have remained silent on the prospects of its closure. <p>
A recent private survey conducted by Business Week magazine, however, found that 69 percent of  business CEO's  it polled favored eliminating the department.<p>
Commerce Secretary Ronald Brown remains the biggest advocate of preserving the
department.  In his efforts to save Commerce, Brown contends that the department is crucial to business and U.S. competitiveness.  Brown also believes that eliminating Commerce would leave a void for business in the Administration.<p>
"These plans to cut Commerce would eliminate business' voice at the Cabinet table just when we have created the most successful public-private partnership relationship in history," remarked Brown.<p>
Critics of  the Clinton Administration do not view Brown's presence during Cabinet
meetings as having been beneficial for business.<p>
Richard Rahn, Chairman of the Business Leadership Council remarked that "It's a sad commentary on the Clinton Administration when only one cabinet member thinks he represents the interests of business.   Secretary Brown is a spokesman for only a fraction of the business community.  All Cabinet members should have a shared agenda of economic growth and job creation through policies that include lower taxes and reduced regulations, a real pro-business agenda -- an agenda we have not seen from Mr. Brown or the Clinton Administration." <p>
With hardly a whimper from the business community to keep the doors of Commerce open, elimination may happen.  But President Clinton and Secretary Brown have made several political friends through Commerce Department activities (such as private trade missions abroad) and may ask those who benefitted to turn up the heat on Congress to stop its door from shutting for good.<p>

<b>Washington, D.C.</b> -- Nearly 4 million illegal aliens are living permanently in the United States. In response to a growing problem, momentum is building in Congress to create a national worker database which would verify the employment eligibility of all U.S. citizens and eligible immigrants.<p>

	Critics of the proposed system have voiced concern that a worker registry would cost taxpayers billions while adding an expensive regulatory condition on U.S. businesses.<p>

	At a time when elected officials are aiming to lift regulatory burdens on U.S. business, the critics say a worker registry would create more paperwork, cause more delays interfere with hiring decisions and spawn legal concerns because of unchartered civil rights issues.<p>

	The national worker registry was recommended by the Commission on Immigration Reform -- more widely known as the Jordan Commission -- chaired by former Rep. Barbara Jordan. The worker registry would be created by merging the databases of the Social Security Administration (SSA) and the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS).<p>

	Legislation proposed by Senator Alan Simpson (R-WY), Chairman of the Immigration Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee, would require employers to call the worker registry system to verify that an applicant is legally authorized to work.<p>

	A forthcoming proposal in the House by Lamar Smith (R-TX) is expected to call for the establishment of a national worker identity card. The ID system would consist of a single tamper-proof card modeled after the social security card.<p>

	The Clinton administration has favored such an approach, as well as the national computer registry. In his proposed 1996 budget, President Clinton included $28 million to start integrating various government databases so the work registry can be developed.<p>

	The administration has also been testing its own program, the Telephone Verification System (TVS). With this system, businesses would be required to purchase special equipment to comply with worker verification.<p>

	For two years, nine companies have participated in the TVS project. The companies call
the INS to verify that non-citizens who apply for work are eligible for employment. A review of this project found that the INS could not accurately rely on the computer information 28 percent of the time and had to perform a manual search of its records.<p>

	According to a special report by the Justice Department, which evaluated the TVS project, secondary verifications were very burdensome to employers. Businesses, which already complain about the burdensome nature of the current employee verification system (the I-9 form), would have more forms to complete as part of the hiring process with a national computer registry. Employers would have to maintain authorization receipts on each employee they check through the new system. Employees subject to secondary verification will require yet another form.<p>

	Of serious concern to business groups and those involved with civil liberty issues, is the federal government's ability to competently manage the immense database. Accuracy of data will be critical to making the registry work, and both the INS and SSA have been widely criticized for inaccuracy in record keeping.<p>

	In California, for example, the INS admitted it lost 60,000 green-card applicant files. And the INS has experienced error rates as high as 30 percent. SSA has estimated that cleaning up its database would initially cost $122 million, and each year thereafter $30 million to maintain.<p>

	According to a 1988 General Accounting Office report, of about 210 million Social Security numbers active "at least 75 percent issued without proof of the individual's identity or citizenship."<p>

	With 65 million Americans changing jobs or entering the job market each year, even a 1 percent failure rate could be problematic -- 650,000 workers could be affected by even minimal errors.<p>

	In addition, those concerned about privacy have speculated that a centralized system would spur the government to include more information about individuals.<p>

	A key feature of the proposed is a monitoring system that tracks which companies access the system. The government would then have the ability to track business's hiring practices, as well as the individual employment history of every American.<p>

	With other major issues before the Congress such as deficit reduction and tax cuts, the proposed national worker registry has received little attention from the news media or the Congressional leadership in either the House and Senate. However, as such legislation makes it way through committees in both chambers, more Members of Congress are beginning to pay attention to the ramifications of a centralized worker registry.<p>

	Will Congress enact a data system affecting 100 percent of the population to combat the problem of 1.5 percent who live in the United States illegally.<p>

	Given the momentum to limit the size and scope of the federal government, the worker registry will indeed be put through a rigorous examination process in Congress. As more business groups learn about the proposed system, the debate will become even more rigorous.<p>

<title>SBB: The Consumers Added to the Equation of Health Care Reform </title>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><center><h2> The Consumers Added to the Equation of Health Care Reform </h2>                                                     </center><hr>



 June 1995 - This time last year, small business organizations were fighting against President and Mrs. Clinton's plan to radically overhaul our nation's health care system. The employer mandate, the centerpiece of the failed proposal, did not sit well with small businesses.  The "crisis" rhetoric seems to have toned down, but high health care costs along with the inability of many businesses to provide health care for their employees still remains a priority issue for our  nation's smaller employers.
<P>
The magnitude of the problem was recently confirmed at the White House Conference on Small Business where nearly two thousands elected delegates from all corners of the country gathered in Washington from June 12-15 to develop a national small business agenda for the Clinton Administration and Congress.  The dominant health care issue was tax equity.  Small businesses and the self-employed only want what corporations already have -- the ability to deduct 100 percent of their health care insurance expenses.
<P>
Is health care reform dead under the leadership of the new Republican controlled Congress?  The answer is no.  But rather than big government schemes and mandates, health care proposals are emerging from the new Congress that are more market-based.  One idea, that has been tried and tested in the private sector is tax free Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs).  The concept has taken Capitol Hill by storm, and it seems that all serious proposals to reform our nation's health care cost problem include an MSA provision.

<P><b>Health Care's "Sick" Underlying Structure</b><P>
   The MSA, say its supporters, will re-establish the buyer-seller relationship between consumers and suppliers of health care services.  Under the predominant third-party system of payments, neither consumers nor providers have an incentive to be concerned about costs.  Therefore, costs naturally rise.
<P>
The two veins to the third party system, government involvement in the health care market (especially since the inception of Medicaid and Medicare) and an expanded definition of "insurance," have perverted health care costs while shielding the health care industry from real market forces that produce competition.   By definition, insurance is supposed to cover catastrophic and unforeseen events.  Today, health insurance plans cover small and predicable expenses.
<P>
Such an expansion of the definition of health insurance, says Small Business Survival Foundation Chief Economist Raymond Keating, "would be the equivalent of extending one's home-owners insurance to cover the costs of mowing the lawn, trimming bushes and painting the house."
<P>
Third-party payments have drastically increased over the past three decades.  In 1950, for example, government financed 25.3 percent of health care expenditures, private insurance 15.8 percent, and 58.9 percent was covered out of pocket.  According to the <i>Statistical Abstract of the United States</I>, by 1991, government financed expenditures equalled 43.9 percent, private insurance and other private sources 36.9 percent, and only 19.2 percent was out of pocket.  
The effect of the usurpation of the buyer-seller relationship has been steadily rising costs.  For example, per capita U.S. health care expenditure between 1965 and 1991 increased by 1,306 percent, versus a rise in the consumer index of 332 percent.

<P><b>Medical Savings Accounts</b><P>	The most common MSA scenario would shift standard health care plans to a split system of an MSA combined with a catastrophic plan.  A standard plan costing $5,000, for example, could be replaced with $3,000 going into an employee's MSA and $2,000 covering a catastrophic plan with a $3,000 deductible.
<P>
The employee withdraws funds from the MSA, penalty free, to pay out-of-pocket medical expenses.  Since the employee now has an established "budget" and is able to keep what he or she does not use by year-end, the employee has an incentive to comparison shop for health care purchases and needs.  As consumers become more concerned with costs, MSA supporters contend that health care providers are forced to be more cost sensitive in pricing health care services -- in other words real competition will be injected into the health care market.
<P>
According to Dan Perrin, Executive Director of the Business Coalition for Affordable Health Care, a 1.6 million member coalition of business organizations that support MSAs, lower income individuals would especially benefit from the reform.  "Under the current system, most people must shell out money until they reach their $500 deductible.  With an MSA, employees have immediate access to funds, easing financial concerns which makes them more happy," says Perrin.
<P>
The MSA account is also owned by the employee, and therefore portable.  Individuals can also build savings in their MSA accounts, which in turn helps offset health care costs in case the employee loses their job.

<P><b>MSA Legislation</b><P>
On June 13, Reps. Bill Archer (R-TX) and Andy Jacobs (D-IN) introduced the Family Medical Savings and Investment Act.  The centerpiece of the legislation includes the creation of MSAs.   At a time when the new Congress is working to be more budget conscious, detractors of MSAs contend that the bill will "cost" taxpayers too much.
<P>
However, Perrin claims that whatever the bill will cost (according to some Capitol Hill sources estimates have been placed at $1.18 billion over five years), it is as close to revenue neutral as you will get, but with dramatic results for our nation's health care system in terms of making health care more affordable for all Americans.  Businesses, too, will benefit from MSAs as administrative costs are reduced according to Perrin.  Forbes, Inc., using an MSA plan since 1991, has reduced its insurance premium costs by 27 percent.  
<P>
Perrin predicts that MSA legislation will be enacted by early fall.  According to other supporters, the current Republican leadership in Congress is anxious to address the health care reform issue, and believes that MSAs will empower individuals while providing incentives to save for expenses not covered in their health plans.  Businesses will be given an opportunity to participate or shift to a system that is more consumer-oriented and puts employees directly in control of their health care purchases.
<P>
The new Congress may not immediately give small businesses and the self-employed the equal tax treatment they are looking for, but perhaps they are giving Americans the opportunity to be consumers once again in the health care market.<P>

<title>Small Business and the Flat Tax</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<center>
<h2>Small Business and the Flat Tax</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
May 1995 - While a hot, mid-summer debate is expected between the U.S. House and
Senate regarding the size and scope of tax cuts (if any at all), both chambers are moving full speed ahead on hearings to study a complete overhaul of our nation's tax system. <p> 
Committees in the House and Senate have already held hearings on the "flat tax"  -- a
simplified postcard system popularized by Republican Majority Leader Dick Armey.  The House Ways and Means Committee will hold a three-day marathon session from June 6-8 on all leading alternative tax systems.   The main plans for replacing the current income tax system include a flat tax, a national sales tax, a consumed-income" tax, or a value-added tax (VAT).  <p>
Hearings on the flat tax and its impact on the small business and entrepreneurial sector were held by the Subcommittee on Taxation and Finance of the House Small Business Committee.  Chairman, Linda Smith (R-WA), a freshman who operated a tax consulting business, is particularly interested in determining the effects of the flat tax on small business.<p>  
"We are placing them [small businesses] at the forefront of the debate on revamping the federal tax system to ensure their voice is heard," said Smith.   <p>
The Subcommittee heard from a diverse group of economists and business organizations, as well as Majority Leader Dick Armey and Senator Arlen Specter (R-Penn) who testified on their respective flat tax proposals.  The Armey Flat Tax plan includes the following elements (after being fully phased in over a three year period):<p>
<ul>
<li>all wages, salaries, and pensions would be taxed at a flat 17 percent rate (begins at 19 percent);
<li>capital gains, earnings from savings, and dividends would not be subject to taxation.
<li>a personal exemption of $13,000 would be permitted for a single person, $17,200 for a single head of household, and $26,200 for a married couple filing jointly, and $5,300 for each dependent.  Exemptions would be indexed for inflation.
<li>business owners would pay a 17 percent rate on the difference between revenues and  expenses, assuming of course that revenues exceed expenses.  The tax would be levied on gross revenue minus purchases of goods and services, capital equipment, structures, land and wages paid to employees.  Deductions would not be allowed for fringe benefits, interest, or payments to owners.<p></ul>
Concerns of members of the subcommittee ranged from transitional issues -- eg: how will small businesses be impacted as the federal government moves from the current tax system to the flat tax? -- to questions about what deductions small businesses may lose under the flat tax scenario.  Economists as well as business leaders agreed that transitional issues are important because business owners have made long-term business decisions based on the current U.S. tax code.<p>
In terms of the impact on business deductions, economist Alvin Rabushka (author of the notable book The Flat Tax) stated that all costs associated with operating a business are fully deductible as business expenses.  According to Rabushka, home offices, advertising costs, and business meals, for example, are qualified business expenses.<p>    
Raymond Keating, chief economist of the Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC)
outlined his criteria for members of Congress to consider upon designing a tax system:<p>
<ul>
<li>Low Flat Tax Rate to Promote Economic Growth
<li>No Taxation of Capital
<li>The Inflation Factor (its effects should be factored into a system's design)
<li>Clarity
<li>Simplicity
<li>Limited Bureaucracy and Intrusiveness
<li>Minimum Incentives For Tax Avoidance
<li>No Additional Boost to Government Spending<p>
</ul>
In his overall assessment of the flat tax before the subcommittee, Keating stated that the flat tax scores high as measured against these standards.  The main downside according to the SBSC economist was that the flat tax was still an income tax which historically has been "high-octane fuel for government spending." <p>
While most small businesses agree that the current tax code is a convoluted mess, the race is still on to convince them that elected officials can design a more fair, less-taxing system.  But as recent surveys show, the flat tax is becoming more popular with business owners and entrepreneurs.  In a recent nationwide survey of 500 small business owners sponsored by SBSC, 56 percent of respondents supported the Armey flat tax proposal.<p>
Powerful interest groups lay waiting in the wings, however, firmly convinced that they
will be severely impacted by the flat tax.  The housing industry, realtors, bankers, accountants and tax attorneys feel they have much to lose under a flat tax system.   Under the Armey flat tax plan, the home mortgage interest deduction would be abolished.  Specter's flat tax (a 20 percent rate) retains the home loan benefit up to $100,000.<p>
To some Washington observers, overhauling the nation's tax system will be politically
impossible.  To others, just being in a political environment where hearings are actually
occurring is a miracle in itself.  Still yet to come is the bottom-line analysis of how the various tax proposals impact the engines of economic growth -- the nation's small businesses.<p>

<title>The Capital Gains Tax Cut Good for Business?</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<center>
<h2><a href="http://www.accf.org">The Capital Gains Tax Cut Good for Business?</a></h2>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
May 1995 - The debate of the 1980's is back, and it is focused on a cut in the capital
gains tax and who benefits from it.  Opponents say it's a big tax cut for the wealthy and will drain the U.S. Treasury.   Supporters contend the cut will benefit everyone by increasing investment, savings, the availability of capital, and tax revenues for the government while decreasing the cost of capital for business investment.<p>
The Republican's Contract With America proposes a reduction in the capital gains tax rate from 28 percent to 19.8 percent by providing for a 50 percent exclusion on capital gains income, and indexing the rate for inflation.  For corporations, there would be an alternative tax rate of 25 percent on capital gains.  The capital gains tax cut in all likelihood will pass the U.S. House of Representatives, but is expected to meet stiff resistance in the Senate.<p>
Partisan sparks flew on the first day of  the Ways and Means Committee tax bill mark-up in the House of Representatives setting the stage for a series of heated and lively debates when the bill hits the floor for a vote.  Minority Leader Richard Gephardt (D-MO) warned that "the Republican tax cuts amount to a massive perk for the privileged, while hard-working middle-class families barely benefit at all."  <p>
Responding to Gephardt, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer (R-TX) said that the Minority Leader was conducting a "misinformation campaign."  The capital gains tax cut measure, included within a $188 billion tax cut proposal for families and businesses, passed the powerful tax writing committee by a 21-14 party-line vote.<p>
What do the experts say about the capital gains tax?  Is it really a tax cut for the rich? 
And, even if it is, does that mean that every one else loses?<p>
<center><b>Economic and U.S. Job Growth</b><p></center>
The U.S. is heavily dependent on its entrepreneurial and small business sector for new job creation.  Over 80 percent of the new jobs in 1993, according to Duns and Bradstreet, were created by small businesses.  But many business owners and entrepreneurs still face a major obstacle to start-up, growth and expansion -- the daunting task of raising capital.  The business advocacy groups in Washington, D.C. favor a capital gains tax cut because it will encourage investment in the small business and entreprenuerial sector. <p>
According to the American Council for Capital Formation (ACCF) Center for Policy
Research, the favorable tax treatment of capital gains is critical to start-up businesses which tend to be riskier investments.  The ACCF Center, in a special report entitled Questions and Answers on Capital Gains, states that most start-up money comes from the family and friends of entrepreneurs.  Lower capital gains taxes encourages these potential investors to risk their savings due to a return in appreciated stock.<p>
High capital gains tax rates significantly cut into potential returns thereby diminishing
incentives to invest.  In the real world of risk-and-reward tradeoffs, the opportunity for high returns must be present in order to entice investment in high-risk ventures, even in new and existing businesses of families and friends.<p>
A examination of venture capital investment in the United States over the past decade has shown a deep decline.  Venture capital was on the rise up to 1986 as the U.S. capital gains tax rate declined; followed by a dramatic downturn as the rate was hiked from 20 percent to 28 percent in 1987 (see chart).  Supporters of reducing and eliminating capital gains tax rates claim that capital would be unlocked, and more capital access to budding and expanding businesses with lower rates.<p>
Critics of  lowering the capital gains tax rate say it will do little for the market,  and
doubts the cut will "free up" capital for investment.  In a paper entitled Another Tax Break for the Wealthy, Dean Baker of the Economic Policy Institute writes that lower tax rates create incentives to hide other income in tax shelters.  Rather than increasing investment in business, a reduction would only add to the tax shelter industry.<p>
<center><b>Capital Gains Tax Spectrum</b><p></center>
A review of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) individual income tax returns show that
capital gains tend to be spread across a wider income spectrum than many believe, or what is reported.  According to 1992 federal income tax returns, 56 percent of returns claiming capital gains were from incomes $50,000 or less, including the capital gain.  Total incomes of $100,000 or less claimed 83 percent of returns with capital gains.<p>

<title>'Contract' Reforms Lift Business Burdens</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<center>
<h2>'Contract' Reforms Lift Business Burdens</h2>  
</center>                                 
<hr>
<br>
April 1995 - Many newly-elected members of the 104th Congress campaigned on a pro-business agenda.  These mostly Republican members of the U.S. House of Representatives, many of whom are small business owners themselves, used the Contract With America as the centerpiece of their campaigns.  What's in store for the business community according to the new Republican majority?  A less-meddlesome, less-regulating, less-taxing federal government.<p>
Already the U.S. House has enacted many of the "Contract" reforms they promised. 
Quite remarkably, most of the legislation to date has easily sailed through the House with the solid support of pro-business Democrats.  But, the most contentious parts of the "Contract" remain, as the House turns to a comprehensive tax relief and spending cuts package.  U.S. Senate passage of many "Contract" provisions also remain in doubt, as Senate leaders say they have their own agenda and timetable for legislation. <p>
Special interests opposed to the "Contract," such as environmental groups, consumer
organizations and the trial lawyers to name a few, have largely focused their lobbying efforts and resources on the upcoming battle in the Senate.<p>
<center><b>Regulatory Relief</b></center><p>   
A comprehensive regulatory reform package,  and a year-long moratorium, or "time-out," on newly proposed regulations easily swept through the House.  Nearly 4,500 new regulations proposed by the Clinton Administration are subject to the moratorium.  The Senate's version of the legislation gives President Clinton the authority to exempt regulations he views as needed to prevent an "imminent" threat to the health and safety of the public.  The Clinton Administration opposes the moratorium. <p>
     Highlights of regulatory reform legislation enacted by the House include:
<ul>
<li>Cost-benefit analysis and risk-assessment standards to be applied to proposed regulations.
<li>The paperwork burden on businesses to be reduced by 10% annually.
<li>Stepped up protection and compensation for private property owners when government regulations reduce the value and use of property.
<li>The Regulatory Flexibility Act, a law already on the books to protect small businesses from excessive regulation, to be strengthened to give small businesses the right to take legal action against the government to enforce the law.
</ul><p>
At a press conference celebrating the passage of reform in the House, regulatory pointman, Majority Whip Tom Delay (R-TX), said the legislation is "the first step toward freedom for millions of individual Americans and hundreds of thousands of job-creating businesses and industries."  <p>
<center><b>Legal Reform</b></center><p>
It seems that if your business involves any risk (which inherently it does) it's not a matter  of when you'll get slapped with a lawsuit, but how much it will cost.  Business interests in Washington played a key role in passing the Common-Sense Legal Reform Act in the House.  The goal behind the legislation, say its supporters,  is to stem the tide of  frivolous law suits, and give business more freedom to do business and pursue innovation.<p>  
Major components of the legislation include:<p>
<ul>
<li>A "loser-pays" rule whereby the losing party in the law suit pays the attorney's fees of the winner.  The amount, however, is limited to the total cost of the loser's own legal fees.
<li>Product Liability:  joint liability for noneconomic damages are abolished under the Act, and a $250,000 cap on punitive damages. 
<li>Lawyer accountability strengthened and "junk-science" testimony disallowed.
<li>Greater protection for growth companies against class-action shareholder law suits.
<li>Written notice must be given to the defendant at least thirty days before a plaintiff can bring suit.  
</ul><p>
<center><b>Tax Relief? What's on the Line for Your Bottom-line</center></b><p>
Remaining "Contract" items of direct consequence to the business and entrepreneurial
sector include a comprehensive tax relief package, coupled with deep spending cuts.  It is shaping up to be the most contentious battle to date in the House.  What's on the line?  Tax cuts for business include:<p>

<center><b>Capital Gains Tax Cut</b></center><p> 
Supporters of the 50 percent cut in, and indexation of the capital gains tax say it will spur economic growth, reduce the cost (while increasing the amount) of capital for investment in small business, and bring in more tax revenues to the federal treasury.  For corporations, there would be an alternative tax rate of 25 percent on capital gains.  Detractors say its a tax cut for the rich, and will drain the treasury.  With class warfare heating up, and widespread support for reducing the deficit, a cut in the capital gains rate may squeak by the House, but looks dimmer every day for passage in the Senate.<p>

<center><b>Home-Office Deduction</b></center><p>  
The tax laws concerning home offices are contradictory and confusing according to many home-office users.  The "Contract" proposal clarifies the deduction for home-offices.  A business owner will qualify if the office is essential to the user's business, is used on an exclusive and regular basis and when tasks in the office cannot be performed elsewhere. <p>

<center><b>Business Expensing</b></center><p>  
The amount small businesses can deduct for equipment purchased in its first year would double to $35,000.  The proposal includes competitive depreciation rules for all businesses under the Neutral Cost Recovery System.  The top-tax writer in the House, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer (R-CA), also determined that the alternative minimum tax should be repealed on a phased-in basis.<p>
<center><b>Estate Tax Exemption</b></center><p>  
The proposal calls for an increase in the exemption from $600,000 to $750,000 to help small businesses pass on a family-owned enterprise to the next generation.  Quite often, the heirs to the family business are forced to sell the business to pay estate taxes under current law. <p>   
<center><b>Paying for the Cuts</center></b><p>
While business likes what it sees on the tax relief and regulatory reform end of the deal,
Republican leaders are bracing for an onslaught of direct lobbying when the spending cuts program is unveiled.    Federal government subsidies to large corporations and industries, as well as the Small Business Administration and other government agencies, are on the chopping block to "pay for" the tax cuts package. <p>
With the public calling for fiscal accountability in government, and many business
owners irked that they have to balance their books to stay in business, lawmakers in  Washington, they contend, should be forced to do the same.  The questions remains as to whether the majority of members in the 104th Congress believe they can reduce the deficit, while providing Americans and businesses with much needed relief.<p>

<P>
Washington, DC 20510<BR>

<P>
Dear Senator ____________:<BR>

<P>
As a small business owner heavily burdened by taxes, I am writing
to urge your support of Senator John Kyl's efforts to eliminate
the federal estate, gift and generation&#173;skipping taxes. 
His &quot;Family Heritage Preservation Act&quot; is long overdue.
 Death taxes must be abolished, nothing less will suffice.<BR>

<P>
I work hard for my family and my employees.  Along the way, I
seem to pay almost every tax imaginable, including income, payroll,
sales and property taxes, not to mention a wide range of fees.
 Naturally, these taxes make it very difficult for me to build
up savings and make additional investment in my business.<BR>

<P>
On top of all this, the government imposes various death taxes.
 It is incomprehensible to me that after paying taxes all my life
&#173;&#173; both personal and business &#173;&#173; the government
could take up to 55% of my buinsess and personal assets.  <BR>

<P>
Please tell me what kind of an incentive I have to continue investing
in and expanding my business?  Indeed, as I get older, why should
I continue in business at all?<BR>

<P>
It is my hope that the business I built will continue on after
I'm gone, hopefully under the guidance of one of my children or
grandchildren.  The federal government's death taxes make this
dream less likely.  It is my understanding that 60% of businesses
fail to make it to a second generation, and 90% don't survive
to a third.  No doubt taxes are a major cause for this dismal
survival rate.  <BR>

<P>
In addition, for all the trouble caused, federal death taxes apparently
count for only 1 percent of federal revenues.  It seems to me
that the government would be far better off getting rid of these
taxes, and thereby encouraging more investment.<BR>

<P>
Again, I urge you to support the &quot;Family Heritage Preservation
Act.&quot;  I don't think it is fair to pay taxes all your life,
and then have the government ask for even more at death.  I believe
that the inherent unfairness of the tax is something reasonable
members of both parties can agree on.  I urge you to repeal this
punitive job-killing tax.<BR>

Sincerely,<BR><P>

<htmL><HEAD><title>SBSC Issues:  Davis-Bacon Repeal</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><center><h2>Davis-Bacon Repeal</h2><p><hr size="4" width="45%"></center>
<P>SBSC has fought hard for the repeal of the notorious Davis-Bacon Act.  This Act was enacted six decades ago in an effort to reduce the influx of black southern workers into northern federal construction projects.  The Act grants the federal government power to determine an area's "prevailing wage."  This anti-market provision has resulted in driving the costs of construction up, thereby increasing costs to taxpayers, while simultaneously creating a large paperwork burden.  Davis-Bacon has prevented small construction firms, who cannot afford to pay the inflated prevailing wages, from competing for federal construction projects.  Davis-Bacon has also prevented many contractors from hiring minority and unskilled workers, who are denied employment opportunity due to hiring preferences resulting from Davis-Bacon.
<P>
Davis-Bacon repeal was recently taken out of the Republican budget bill, and some members of Congress wish to strengthen Davis-Bacon (which they mistakingly call "reform") by applying it to off-site construction. The Department of Labor recently imposed Davis-Bacon wage and paperwork requirements on those who build ships for the federal government.  Obviously, it is important that we step up the fight for Davis-Bacon repeal.  
<P><i>See Karen Kerrigan's testimony "<a href="/sbsc/ct2-15-5.html">Repeal of the Davis Bacon Act</a>", or Raymond Keating's "<a href="/sbsc/reg1-5.html">Repeal the Davis Bacon Act</a>" for more information.</i>

<html><head><title>SBSC Issues:  Immigration Reform</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<center><h3> Immigration Reform Act of 1995, S. 1394
<P>
Immigration in the National Interest Act, H.R. 2202</h3><hr width="45%" size="4"><P>
</center>
In the name of immigration reform, the House immigration subcommittee
recently passed H.R. 2202 sponsored by Representative Lamar Smith
(R. TX).  Contrary to the smaller-government principles espoused
by the Republican Congress, H.R. 2202 and similar Senate proposals
(S.269 and S. 1394), increase federal government spending, expand
governmental control over businesses, and will ultimately weaken
the United States' economy.  
<P>
The latest statistical report from the Immigration and Naturalization
Service (INS) noted a drop in United States legal immigration
for the fiscal year 1994.  Ironically, our nation's legislators
and presidential hopefuls believe that illegal immigration and
legal immigration are pressing national problems requiring immediate
and drastic measures.  
<P>
The Senate immigration subcommittee will soon begin markup of
Senator Alan Simpson's (R. WY) legal immigration proposal, S.
1394.  Unfortunately, Senator Simpson's legal immigration legislation
intensifies the restrictive measures of H.R. 2202.
<P>
Senator Simpson seeks a 25% tax on businesses that hire foreign
workers.  Under S. 1394, companies hiring foreign help would have
to pay a tax equal to one-quarter of the employee's annual compensation
including wages and benefits.  In addition, employers would be
forced to pay that employee 105% of the prevailing wage (an expansion
of the job-killing Davis-Bacon Act).
<P>
  Moreover, H.R. 2202 and S. 269 (a similar Senate <I>illegal
</I>immigration proposal authored by Senator Simpson) mandate
another costly regulation on businesses -- employment verification
system.  Analysts estimate that this latest government-imposed
absurdity, will costs U.S. businesses approximately $4.4 billion
dollars.  And analysts predict the system will do nothing to halt
illegal immigration.
<P>
Furthermore, economists predict U.S. businesses will feel the
force of the mandate at least three times: first, when taxes are
raised to pay for the creation of the database; second, when employers
are required to purchase the machinery to operate the verification
system; and third, when employers are denied eligible employees
because of flawed data. 
<P>
The Clinton Administration and sponsors of the immigration reform
measures are expanding big government to unimaginable levels.
<P>
 Unfortunately, the majority of persons who will get caught in
the system will be American citizens, whose right to work should
never be hindered, and the employer, whose right to employ should
never be relinquished to a government entity.
<P>
For more information on the telephone verification system, see
Karen Kerrigan's Small Business Briefing article Worker Database
Could Cost Businesses Billions.

<html><head><title>SBSC Issues:  Independent Contractors</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<center><h2>Independent Contractors</h2><hr width="45%" size="4"><P>
</center>
On June 30, 1995, Representative Jon Christensen (R-NE) introduced
H.R. 1972, the &quot;Independent Contractor Tax Simplification
Act of 1995.&quot;  This piece of legislation seeks to establish
clear criteria for defining the tax status for the self-employed
as independent contractor.  Currently, the IRS subjects numerous
individuals who work autonomously to an infamous 20-factor test.
<P>
 This test challenges the tax status of many of those who choose
to work independently.  Additionally, the ambiguous, subjective
20-factor test may reclassify independent contractors as employees,
causing back-taxes and penalties for the business contracting
with the individual.
<P>
Rep. Christensen's bill would clearly state who is not an employee,
and it allows independent contractors to avoid the 20-factor test.
<P>
 Currently H.R. 1972 is in the House Ways and Means Committee.
<P>
Despite large support from the small business community and many
legislators, this bill requires a continuous effort to ensure
passage.  For more information, see Karen Kerrigan's article &quot;IRS
should revise contract-worker tests.&quot;
<P>
Send a letter to the following Senators and Congressman expressing your support of the Independent Contractor Tax Simplification Act:<p>

<html><head><title>SBSC Issues:  Minimum Wage</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<center><h2>Minimum Wage</h2><hr width="45%" size="4">
<p></center>
Congress is once again considering a minimum wage hike.  The Senate recently approved a procedural motion that will bring a minimum wage increase vote within the next several months. The minimum wage, which is politically popular, is most harmful to small businesses.  Most employers pay above the minimum wage, and many determine wages according to the minimum wage.  Thus an increase in the minimum wage will have a ripple effect on the wages paid by businesses - many small firms simply cannot absorb such a budget impact.

<h3>
Time to Overhaul Labor Laws and the NLRB<BR>
</h3>
<P>
<b>
by Raymond J. Keating
<br>
Chief Economist
<br>
Small Business Survival Committee
</b>
<hr>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>
Since its creation in the midst of the Great Depression and the
New Deal, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has been a
source of great controversy.  Depending upon which political party
controlled the White House, therefore controlling the appointment
of the NLRB's five board members, accusations would fly regarding
the NLRB leaning too far in favor of either the rights of workers
or management.  <BR>
<P>
Unfortunately, the controversy created by the NLRB perpetuates
the outmoded notion that business managers/employers and their
employees must always be in conflict.  Under its current modus
operandi, the NLRB hurts both workers and businesses &#173;&#173;
and therefore, the economy in general.<BR>
<P>
The Unfair Labor Practices Controversy.  The NLRB was established
under the National Labor Relations Act (the Wagner Act) of 1935.
 The Board is empowered to conduct and certify elections to determine
if employees desire to be represented by a union, and to prevent
unfair labor practices by both employers and unions or their agents.
 <BR>
<P>
While the Wagner Act and other pieces of federal labor legislation
over the years are usually portrayed as benefitting employees,
in a very real sense, such legislation takes away the individual's
right to contract.  In congressional testimony on February 7,
1996, Richard L. Trumka, Secretary&#173;Treasurer of the AFL&#173;CIO,
asked: &quot;Are we still committed to the right of working men
and women to associate freely?&quot;  Unfortunately, the answer
to this question is &quot;no,&quot; and has been &quot;no&quot;
for decades.  Labor laws &#173;&#173; supported by Mr. Trumka
and his union &#173;&#173; require individuals to join unions
and/or pay union dues, who otherwise would not choose to do so.
 The interests of labor's leaders win out over the interests of
non&#173;union workers and individuals who have no interest in
joining a union.<BR>
<P>
More prominent controversies arise related to the NLRB function
of preventing unfair labor practices.  As James Bovard puts it
in his book Lost Rights: The Destruction of American Liberty:
&quot;In reality, an 'unfair labor practice' is whatever displeases
a majority of the five political appointees to the National Labor
Relations Board.&quot;  Not surprisingly, a body carrying the
title the &quot;National Labor Relations Board&quot; carries an
inherent bias in favor of labor unions.  A cursory examination
of NLRB decisions reveals just such a bias:<BR>
<P>
<ul>
<li> Earlier this year, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals
reversed an NLRB decision which created, according to the Court,
the &quot;imprimatur of industrial anarchy.&quot;  In the Earle
Industries case, the NLRB sanctioned an employer who had disciplined
an employee for escorting a trespasser, activist Jesse Jackson,
through the plant during a union organizing campaign.  The Court
ruled that the employee's interest in unionizing could not override
the employer's interest in protecting its property.1  <BR>
<P>
<li> Again in Lost Rights, James Bovard notes stark differences
in how the NLRB treats employer and union actions: &quot;NLRB
officials have a very expansive concept of coercion when it comes
to management behavior; companies have been found guilty of 'unfair
labor practices' for merely criticizing unions or for offering
raises to their workers before the workers vote on whether to
join a union. ...  Yet the NLRB ruled in July 1993 that a Teamsters
union local affiliate's filing of a $20 million class&#173;action
lawsuit against an employer just before an election was not objectionable
conduct or an unfair labor practice.&quot;  In addition, Bovard
outlines various cases of union violence and the lack of response
by the NLRB.  Bovard concludes:<BR>
</ul>
<P>
&quot;Picketing routinely degenerates into a simple economic blockade
&#173;&#173; an effort to cutoff entrances and exits of the picketed
site.  Thus, it is surprising that the NLRB finds excuses or pretexts
to discount the reality of picket&#173;line violence.&quot;<BR>
<P>
Indeed in certain ways, the NLRB has become a means for perpetuating
union violence and threats.  For example, as reported in SBS Foundation's
Labor Watch (Issue 8), the NLRB apparently forgot the violence
associated with the 1985 strike against the Chicago Tribune stirred
by the hiring of replacement workers.  The strike came to a close
in 1986, and by May 1989, the process of reinstating striking
workers was well under way.  The Pressman's union has since been
seeking the names and addresses of replacement workers still employed
at the Tribune.  The NLRB ordered the Tribune to hand over the
information.  Fortunately, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh
Circuit ensured employee protections and refused to enforce the
NLRB order.  Violence against replacement workers during the strike
included tire slashing, death threats, as well as the stabbing
of a delivery driver.<BR>
<P>
The Clinton NLRB.  President Clinton's NLRB has exhibited overt
favoritism toward the labor union agenda.  Indeed, the NLRB now
has crossed the line from a largely judicial body into the realm
of public&#173;policy advocacy and politics.<BR>
<P>
For example, NLRB Chairman William B. Gould IV has publicly declared
his support for banning the employer's right to hire striker replacements.
 Gould also has denounced the TEAM Act, which would allow employers
and employees to form committees to work together on workplace
issues &#173;&#173; a simple act of teamwork and cooperation that
the NLRB deems in many cases as illegal under the Wagner Act.
<BR>
<P>
Also, the NLRB has proposed implementing a single&#173;site rule,
which carries huge potential benefits for labor unions.  The rule
presumes that a single facility of an employer is the appropriate
bargaining unit under most circumstances.  This makes union organizing
efforts far easier for smaller entities such as restaurant franchises.
 <BR>
<P>
Other recent pro&#173;union NLRB decisions include:
<P>
<ul>
<li> In Manganaro, the NLRB legalized anti&#173;dual shop clauses
which could allow unions to shut down non&#173;union subsidiaries
or impose union membership on non&#173;union workers without a
secret vote.<BR>
<P>
<li> In California Saw, the NLRB virtually neutered employee
Beck rights by letting the unions themselves to decide what are
and are not union political expenses.<BR>
<P>
<li> In Elliott Turbomachinery, the Board gutted property and
ownership rights by ignoring contract language granting an employer
exclusive discretion in relocating its facilities.<BR>
<P>
<li> In Shepard Convention Services, the Board ruled against
its own regulations and ordered a mail ballot election, and then
certified a union even though it was endorsed by only 9 percent
of eligible voters.  This decision was reversed upon appeal, however.
</ul>
<BR>
<P>
In addition, President Clinton made clear the political nature
of the NLRB.  Late last year, the President formally nominated
Senate staffer Sarah M. Fox (Sen. Ted Kennedy's chief labor counsel
on the Labor and Human Resources Committee) to the Board.  Ms.
Fox's pro&#173;union credentials are quite formidable.  She has
been a union lawyer and a key strategist for pro&#173;labor union
legislation.  Knowing this appointment was in grave danger, the
President added Ms. Fox to the Board through a recess appointment
in January.<BR>
<P>
The President reportedly now seeks two Republican appointees to
bring the Board to full complement.  Though, the strong union
ties of the three current Democrat members are no way in doubt.
<BR>
<P>
Reform Measures.  Labor law and the NLRB are in desperate need
of reform in order to protect the rights of individual workers
and business owners.  Ideally, the federal government should extract
itself from involvement in labor issues altogether.  However,
chances of repealing federal labor laws and leaving matters to
the states are currently quite remote, to say the least.  Therefore,
the following principles should lie at the center of labor reform
efforts:<BR>
<P>
<ul>
<li> No individual's right to contract should be subjugated
to other individuals' desires for union representation.  A National
Right to Work law stating that no one should be required to join
a union, nor be forced to pay dues to a union, needs to be passed.
<BR>
<P>
<li> Severe consequences should result from union violence.
 Some argue that the pro&#173;union labor laws of the early half
of this century were implemented in response to employer violence
against union organizers.  In the second half of the twentieth
century, union violence against non&#173;union workers and employers
calls for clear and severe penalties against unions and their
members who participate in and promote violence.  Clearly, the
NLRB should not establish acceptable levels of violence permitted
on picket lines before action is taken (as the Board currently
does).  No degree of violence is acceptable.  The law should be
unequivocal, including decertification of unions involved and
jail time.<BR>
<P>
<li> The NLRB has been reluctant to put an end to union &quot;salting&quot;
campaigns, whereby union organizers apply for jobs at non&#173;union
sites with the intent of either bringing discrimination charges
against the employer to the NLRB, disrupting the workplace, or
running up employer costs.  Such individuals do not seek legitimate
employment, but instead seek to organize and inflict economic
damage.  Clear laws against salting are needed.  <BR>
</ul>
<P>
Put an End to Activist Regulators.  The NLRB is an example of
judicial activism taken to the extreme.  Politically appointed
&quot;judges&quot; have a documented history of making decisions
based on their own views of the world, rather than according to
laws.  The NLRB also exemplifies the general problem with Congress
and the White House delegating powers to regulators and rule&#173;making
bodies.  Indeed, the time has come for our elected officials to
take direct responsibility for the federal regulatory apparatus,
including the NLRB.  The powers of regulators should be clear
and limited, and all rules, regulations, and fines approved by
Congress and the President.<BR>
<P>
In the end, as for the NLRB, its blatantly political and activist
decisions call into question its very existence.  If the federal
government is to remain intertwined in labor issues, then oversight
of elections and initial prevention of unfair labor practices
are reasonable duties that can be carried out with some degree
of objectivity.  However, Congress should give serious consideration
to allowing disputes arising from this process to go directly
to federal courts and eliminating the NLRB's judicial role altogether.

<h3>Costs of Another FDA War:Economic Fallout from Reduced Advertising and Promotional Expenditures</h3><b>by Raymond J. Keating<br>Chief Economist<br>Small Business Survival Committee</b></center><p><hr><p>
Under the generalship of Commissioner David Kessler, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has declared war on a host of businesses and industries.  Recent FDA battles include raids on vitamin clinics and orange juice producers, a pseudo-science attack on silicone breast implants, and a bureaucratic assault on the nation's health and economic vitality through long delays in drug and medical device approvals.1  By outflanking its original mission, now the FDA adds an attack on the tobacco industry to this seemingly ever-growing list.  A question remains: Is this a "just" regulatory war?<p>Considering that tobacco products always have been legally produced and sold in this country and that individual freedom and choice is rightfully cherished in a land of liberty, clearly makes this new FDA regulatory war just as unjust as the battles listed above.  Simply because a handful of elected officials and federal government bureaucrats do not like certain products does not give them the right to rage a regulatory jihad in response.<p>In addition, any just war theory calls for no direct attacks on or injuries or fatalities to non-combatants.  Hence, during wartime, attacks on civilian targets usually generate moral outrage.  In regulatory wars, noncombatants of the economic type always suffer.  The FDA's move against tobacco will have a real and significant impact on noncombatants -- lending even greater weight to the charge of the FDA waging an unjust regulatory war.  Numerous among these noncombatants will be a host of small businesses, including convenience and grocery stores, advertising companies, a variety of manufacturers, print shops -- the list goes on and on.  <p>FDA's Proposed Tobacco Regulations.  According to the Federal Register, the FDA proposed tobacco regulations include prohibiting cigarette vending machines, free samples, mail-order sales, and self-service displays; limiting advertising and labeling "which children and adolescents are exposed to" to black-and-white, text-only formats; no advertis
ing within 1,000 feet of a school or playground; banning the sale or distribution of branded non-tobacco items such as hats and t-shirts; and restrict sponsorship of events to the corporate name only, not the tobacco product brand name.  Also, the proposed regulations would federalize 18 years as the legal age for purchasing tobacco products and require that manufacturers fund anti-smoking educational campaigns.  <p>Specifically, the FDA's stated goal is to cut youth smoking by half within seven years, and if not achieved, then taking unspecified, additional steps.  Of course, the impact of these measures would reach well beyond any youth market and raises worrisome questions about the FDA's long-term goals relating to the tobacco industry.  After all, an August 1995 report by the FDA declared "that nicotine in cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products is a drug, and that these products are drug delivery devices within the meaning of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act."  If true, the criminalization of tobacco products production and distribution must be a real possibility.  One has to wonder: Is the FDA seeking prohibition with all its commensurate woes?<p>For the short term, though, this FDA effort is essentially based on the highly questionable notion that advertising has a significant impact on youth decisions to smoke -- much more so than the more likely influences of peer pressure and family life.  The FDA also assumes that the federal government should, and can, direct the personal tastes and habits of Americans.  As in other cases where the nanny state runs amok, real and significant economic costs are incurred.<p>
<b>FDA Faulty Estimates</b>  According to an economic analysis performed for the Small Business Survival (SBS) Foundation by the American Economics Group, Inc.2,  the FDA's projections of potential job losses due to these regulatory proposals are grossly underestimated.  The FDA asserts that approximately 1,000 jobs annually would be lost in the tobacco warehouse, manufacturer, grower, and wholesaler sectors for about 10 years.  While a ten-year total of 10,000 jobs lost is nothing to gloss over, the American Economics Group report notes that this amounts falls far short of the actual numbers: "Incredibly, the FDA does not include a job loss estimate for the sectors that would be most vulnerable to its regulations -- the advertising, manufacturing and retail industries."<p>Substantive Cost Estimates.  The American Economics Group study for SBS Foundation examined the sales, employment, and wage impact of promotional and advertising expenditures by tobacco firms and found the following:<p>
<ul>
<li> Based on 1993 numbers, direct spending on advertising and promotion by tobacco companies employs an estimated 78,836 workers in the United States, and by the time you factor in the additional activity generated by these individuals, "the cycle of buying, all begun by tobacco advertising and promotion, continues until ... 209,112 persons are employed as a result."<p><li> Direct advertising and promotion purchases by tobacco firms amounted to more than $6.1 billion in 1993, with total generated purchases topping $17.9 billion.  Direct wages and salaries amounted to more than $1.9 billion, and "subsequent activity" generated more than $3.2 billion for a total of over $5.2 billion in wages and salaries in 1993.<p>
<li> Direct advertising and 
promotion expenditures by tobacco firms fall into 11 major industry categories -- food products and tobacco, apparel, printing and publishing, rubber and leather products, instruments and related products, miscellaneous manufacturing industries, transportation, wholesale trade, retail trade, business services, and miscellaneous services.  Subsequent derived expenditures impact 37 different industry groups.<p>
<li> The proposed FDA tobacco 
regulations place much of these advertising and promotional expenditures at risk, and therefore, the businesses -- many small, entrepreneurial firms -- tied into such activity as well.  <p>
<li> In terms of lost jobs, the report concludes that about 45,000 full and part time direct jobs and at least 65,000 derived jobs could be lost over a three to five year period.  This job loss estimate is 11 times the FDA's estimate.  And it should be remembered that these American Economics Group estimates only count jobs related to a decline in advertising and promotional expenditures by tobacco firms due to the proposed regulations, and not additional job losses due to any kind of decline in the purchase of tobacco products.  <p>
</ul><b>Excess Regulation Hurts the Economy</b><p>
  If a federal government agency is going to declare war on any industry with increased oversight and regulation, then a full accounting of the potential damage should be undertaken.  Increased federal regulation is not a costless endeavor.  Regulations have the same impact as taxes -- raising the costs of investing, risk taking, and generally "doing business."  These costs translate into less investing and entrepreneurship, lower profitability, increased chances of business failure (especially for smaller firms operating on a razor's edge), and less employment.  Therefore, federal agencies like the FDA have a responsibility to realistically examine the costs and benefits of their regulatory initiatives.
  <p>Unfortunately, when 
undertaking a regulatory jihad, FDA officials fail to even concern themselves with proper jurisdiction -- tobacco regulation has never fallen within the FDA's regulatory domain -- never mind real costs.  Orange juice producers, vitamin clinics, medical device firms, drug companies, and now tobacco-related businesses -- more and more industries are being sucked into the FDA's unjust regulatory wars.

<h3>Costs of Another FDA War:Attack on Vending Machines, An Attack on Jobs and Small Business</h3><b>by Raymond J. Keating<br>Chief Economist<br>Small Business Survival Committee</b></center><p><hr><p>

In the <a href="/sbsc/rw-fdaw1.html">first installment</a> in this three-part series, it was noted that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) proposed tobacco regulations could cost the economy -- at minimum -- an estimated 110,000 jobs over a three to five year period.1  This far outpaces the FDA's own estimate of 10,000 jobs over ten years.  The FDA failed to account for the full cost of its proposed legislation.
<P>One industry hit particularly hard by the proposed regulations is vending services.  Under the proposed FDA tobacco regulations, the sale of cigarettes through vending machines would be completely banned.  
<P>In a recent Wall Street Journal article ("If Cigarette Industry Coughs, Remote Areas Expect to Catch Cold," October 26, 1995), Mark Stomel, the owner of a vending machine company, noted who would be hurt by such a ban: "The man that fills the vending machines, the mechanic that fixes them, the people who do the maintenance of the vehicles. ... It spreads like wildfire."  He also reported that 25 percent of Stomel Vending Co.'s sales would be wiped out.
<P>The National Automatic Merchandising Association (NAMA) reports that cigarettes and tobacco sales represent 7.1 percent of sales by automatic merchandise machine operators, and a ban on these sales would mean thousands of lost jobs.
<P>The FDA claims that it has undertaken this regulatory assault on tobacco in order to cut youth smoking in half in seven years.  The FDA assumes that an end to cigarette distribution through vending machines will greatly assist this effort.  However, NAMA's numbers tell a different story.  <P>
<ul>
<LI> Cigarette purchasing habits of individuals ages 13 through 17:<P>				Convenience stores		43%				Gas stations			29%				Grocery stores			11%				Vending machines		  9%				Drug stores			  6%<P>

<LI> Location of vending 
machines:<P>		Locales rarely frequented by minors		77.5%			Bars, cocktail lounges		31%			Industrial plants		27%			Offices				12%			Hotels/Motels			  4%			Universities/Colleges		  3.5%		
Other Locales					22.5%			Restaurants			13%			Terminals, Rec - Bowling Centers, misc.	  9.5%			   <P>These numbers raise serious questions regarding the FDA's efforts.  Meanwhile, such a highly questionable undertaking presents real risks to an industry completely dominated by small businesses.  Vending Times reports that 26 percent of vending service providers are one-person (or family-only) establishments; 15 percent have only one part-time employee; another 28 percent claim 1-3 full-time employees; and 10 percent have 3.5-5 full-time employees.  In total, an incredible 90 percent of all vending firms employ less than 20 employees.  The survival of many of these firms is placed in jeopardy due to the proposed ban of cigarette sales through vending machines by the FDA.  </ul>
<P>While the FDA should not be involved in tobacco regulation at all, the aforementioned numbers addressing the purchasing habits of young smokers and the location of vending machines, show that little, if anything, would be gained on the youth smoking front by banning vending machines and throwing small businesses into turmoil.  The job of stopping youth smoking -- a goal worth supporting -- falls to parents, not federal government bureaucrats in Washington, D.C.  Governmental social engineering always fails -- and at great cost to the taxpayer, business, and the economy.<P><hr><P><center><b>End Notes</b></center><P>

<h3>FDA Facts: Exporting Entrepreneurship</h3><b>by Raymond J. Keating<br>Chief Economist<br>Small Business Survival Committee</b></center><p><hr><p>

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has become the model of a plodding, costly, and even deadly government bureaucracy.  The agency remains infamous for its ability to throw monkey wrenches into the machinations of some of the most dynamic industries of the late twentieth century, such as medical devices and pharmaceuticals.  Indeed, the FDA is slowing medical progress, hampering entrepreneurial enterprises, and destroying jobs due to regulatory obstacles and bureaucratic gridlock.	The FDA seems more intent on exporting American ingenuity and entrepreneurship, rather than encouraging the production of U.S.-made drugs and medical devices.	
<p>
FDA Responsibilities.  The FDA carries a long list of responsibilities, summarized as: regulating drug, food, cosmetics, biological product, and medical device labeling; approving new drugs, biological products, and medical devices; setting drug, biological product and medical device manufacturing guidelines; and establishing safety and effectiveness standards for drugs, biological products, and medical devices.	
<p>
To implement this ambitious agenda, the FDA staff totaled 9,217 in 1994, up from 1,678 in 1960 -- an increase of 449 percent.1  In 1994, the FDA's gross budget authority equaled $935.7 million.2	
<p>
<b>FDA vs. Entrepreneurs</b>
<p>
  As is the case with most regulatory agencies, the FDA seemed like a good idea at first, but it has grown into a massive, misguided undertaking.  The FDA has placed enormous burdens on the food, pharmaceutical, and medical device industries -- discouraging investment and risk taking in some of America's leading industries.	Examples of the havoc being wrought by the FDA abound:<p>
<ul>
<li> In the August/September 1995 issue of Reason magazine, Rick Henderson reported that "the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health takes more than three times longer to approve a Class III or 'substantial risk' medical device (such life-saving products as heart valves or CAT scanners) than do the agency's counterparts in Europe."  The impact of such delays?  "In the past 10 months, reports a survey published in June by the Health Industry Manufacturers Association, 50 percent of the more than 500 device makers surveyed had moved some clinical trials of new medical devices overseas; 56 percent refused to test new devices on Medicare patients; and 75 percent planned to move their trials to Europe."	
<p>
Henderson also noted, "The average time it takes a drug company to develop and gain approval of a new drug has almost doubled over the past 30 years -- from 8.1 years in the 1960s to 14.5 years today.  And, reports the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America ... more than 60 percent of new drugs and biologics (genetically engineered pharmaceuticals) approved here in the 1990s were first approved in another country."<p>

<li> Thomas G. Donlan noted industry trends driven by the FDA's regulatory maze in the July 3, 1995 issue of Barron's: "The failure of U.S. regulation can ... be seen in the scrambles that have roiled the industry to put research and manufacturing offshore, to make partnerships with foreign drug firms and to merge and merge and merge again in an attempt to create firms that are large enough to weather all the risks of regulation."	Of course, market-driven mergers in an industry are by no means worrisome.  However, substantial industry changes being driven by regulatory costs should cause regulators and their supposed overseers -- i.e., elected officials -- to re-evaluate their regulatory activities.<p>

<li> Robert Higgs, in a report for the Competitive Enterprise Institute, noted the hurdles companies face even when making improvements in already existing products or in their manufacturing processes: "Changes in the product or the manufacturing process, no matter how small, might cause the product to be consigned to an indefinite stay in preapproval purgatory.  FDA failed to differentiate between new devices and manufacturing changes for existing devices.  Manufacturers therefore had a reduced incentive to make the minor improvements that, cumulating over time, could greatly improve the performance of their products and the efficiency of their manufacturing operations."<p>

<li> Higgs also reported that FDA policies and conduct have boosted costs for medical device firms considerably -- perhaps adding $10 million to $20 million to a firm's budget, as well as several additional years before a new device gets to the market.  Such costs greatly reduce venture capital investment in new and expanding enterprises making medical devices.  One can only speculate as to the total number of potentially life-saving innovations and inventions that fail to reach consumers because regulatory costs reduce potential returns to such an extent that capital simply dries up.	In addition, Higgs noted that from 1989 to 1991, U.S. medical technology firms invested roughly the same amount abroad annually -- $321 million-$333 million.  "Then in 1992, when FDA abruptly made its enforcement and approval policies more onerous, capital outflow jumped more than 200 percent to $993 million."<p>

<li> One also has to wonder whether large firms feel the FDA's battering as severely as smaller and start-up enterprises.  Rick Henderson asserts in Reason that large, established pharmaceutical companies have benefited from the FDA's regulatory maze.  New, smaller firms lack the resources, expertise, and patience to surf the FDA's regulatory tidal wave.  Hence, entrepreneurs wipe out -- the system results in fewer competitors for established firms.<p>

<li> A 1993 report from the House Energy and Commerce Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee acknowledged the woes tied to the FDA's approval process for medical devices: "The situation is intolerable.  The backlog for pending device applications exceeds 1,100. ... The FDA's enforcement practices have demoralized and perplexed much of the medical device industry."3  <p>

<li> In testimony before the House Joint Economic Committee Hearing on Technical Innovations in Health Care on June 24, 1994, Robert C. DeHaven of the American Electronics Association declared that the FDA's "inordinately slow" regulatory process was threatening "the global competitiveness" of the medical device industry -- a $70 billion industry with more than 11,000 companies.<p>

<li> A recent American Electronics Association survey reportedly found that 40 percent of medical device firms reduced their number of U.S. employees because of FDA delays, 29 percent boosted investment in foreign operations, and 22 percent moved U.S. jobs out of the country.4  <p>

<li> FDA approval times have mounted.  For example, in 1988, it took an average of 78 days for the FDA to approve a product change (i.e., a 510-K application); by 1992, approval time had grown to an average of 126 days.5  This number further ballooned to 173 to 213 days by 1994.6   These applications are supposed to be approved within 90 days, according to FDA guidelines.  		Approvals of new devices take anywhere from 437 to 840 days.7  New device approvals, however, are supposed to be completed within 180 days.	Meanwhile, the median approval time for generic drug applications stretched out from 12 months to 38 months between 1986 and 1993.8  Of course, all of these numbers exclude FDA requirements placed on firms that extend development time.<p>

<li> The chief executive of the Minnesota-based Minntech Corp., Louis Cosentino, best summed up the effect of the FDA on entrepreneurs and the U.S. economy: "The attitude of the FDA is so antibusiness and so negative at this point that any prudent CEO has to be looking outside the U.S. as a safe haven."  Minntech laid off 50 Minnesota employees while expanding in Europe.9  <p>	

Meanwhile, the so-called benefits for consumers from all these added delays and costs remain difficult to detect.  In fact, bureaucratic delays by the FDA apparently cost tens of thousands of lives annually, as products and treatments are being denied to American consumers.	Export Restrictions.  Adding insult to injury, the FDA erects barriers to the export of U.S. medical products as well.  Even if a product has been approved for use in a foreign country, the FDA generally does not allow for exportation to that nation if the product has not received FDA approval.  Again, in the case of medical devices, a lengthy FDA approval process is needed in order to export.10  	

The CEO of a medical device company was denied permission to export by the FDA -- so he moved the company from the U.S. to Switzerland.  The CEO observed: "The FDA denied us permission to export. ... So we had to export our manufacturing plant."11  	
</ul>
<P>
<b>Entrepreneurs in the Regulatory Process?</b>
<P>
  One can at least be somewhat encouraged by the fact that the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives recognizes the many woes of the FDA.  In fact, Speaker Newt Gingrich went so far as to refer to the FDA as a "Stalinistic" agency and the "leading job killer" in the nation.12  Under the FDA's yoke, entrepreneurs and businesses possess every incentive to cease research and development, shift operations and jobs out of the country, or close down operations altogether.	
<p>
Congress needs to take bold steps.  Reports about FDA incompetence, abrasiveness, gridlock, intrusions, and costs are so numerous that they lead one to believe that more than mere reform is required.  Former U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan pointed in the right direction when he wrote in the June 27, 1995 Washington Times: "Instead of making yet another effort to reform a system that seems incapable of reform, we should begin thinking about the design of a new system.  In my view, such a system would require considerable decentralization, perhaps along the lines of the European systems, where non-government institutions play a much greater role in the process of reviewing and approving new medical products."	
<p>
According to economist James Bovard writing in the December 8, 1994 
Wall Street Journal: "Rep. Gingrich favors replacing the FDA with an agency staffed with medical entrepreneurs, with strict limits on their time in government."  While one has to wonder why entrepreneurs would be willing to staff a government agency, the sentiment is correct.  In addition, this addresses a nagging question regarding the FDA: Can regulators ever be qualified enough to register sound judgments regarding such dynamic industries as biomedical companies?  Tapping medical entrepreneurs is a good idea, but would be better achieved by allowing private firms to undertake FDA safety approvals.  Meanwhile, efficacy should be left to the marketplace.	
<p>
>b>Global Competition</b>
<P>
  The FDA is taking a heavy toll on the U.S. economy in terms of lost entrepreneurship, investment, jobs, and international competitiveness.  In a world where both capital and labor can move with increasing ease and freedom, the U.S. regulatory regime is operating within an increasingly competitive global environment.  An agency that delays the approvals of beneficial drugs and medical devices to the degree that the FDA does ensures that U.S.-based firms operate at a severe disadvantage.  Of course, not only does this mean less investment, slower economic growth, and fewer jobs, but it also means that U.S. consumers often are denied access to life-saving  devices and treatments.  	
<p>
Competition can do wonders.  The U.S. regulatory regime acts as a severe drag on our economy.  Congress must act to make the U.S. food and drug regulatory environment more competitive on the world stage, or continue to lose cutting-edge firms and high-paying jobs to other nations.

<h3>FDA Facts: Strong-Arming American Business</h3><b>by Raymond J. Keating<br>Chief Economist<br>Small Business Survival Committee<p></b></center><hr>
<p>		
In the previous Small Business Reg Watch 1995, "FDA Facts: Exporting Entrepreneurship," the Small Business Survival Committee examined many of the costs and delays that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration  (FDA) imposes on firms in the medical device and pharmaceutical industries.  As a result, enterprises have either cut back on research and development, moved operations out of the country, or simply closed their doors.	However, the FDA does not stop at mere incompetence and bureaucratic gridlock.  In the 1990s, under the guidance of FDA Commissioner David Kessler, the FDA's enforcement efforts have become increasingly aggressive and intrusive.  One might say that the FDA has been strong-arming U.S. businesses.	FDA Intrusions.  Reports abound of the FDA's move to more aggressive and confrontational methods under Dr. Kessler's reign.  For example:<p>
<ul>
<li> In the May 1995 issue of Reason magazine, analyst Alexander Volokh reported: "Since 1990, when David Kessler took over as FDA commissioner, enforcement has been one of the FDA's top priorities.  In his first two months, Kessler added 100 new criminal investigators to his enforcement staff, many of them formerly with the Secret Service and Drug Enforcement Administration.  Armed raids on alternative health clinics and dietary supplement dealers followed, as well as increased warning letters, product seizures, and criminal prosecutions in the drug and device industries."<p>

<li> In the January 1995 issue of The American Spectator ("Double-Crossing to Safety"), James Bovard reported on the FDA's raid on Proctor & Gamble's "Citrus Hill Fresh Choice" orange juice.  The FDA disputed the use of the word "fresh" on the label, saying it was misleading.  Proctor & Gamble noted a survey showing that consumers knew that "Fresh Choice" did not mean fresh squeezed, and besides, "Made from Concentrate" was also on the label.  Bovard reports: "Kessler ... took sweeping action: He ordered U.S. marshalls to seize the juice -- 12,000 gallons, as it turned out -- and destroy it.  Federal law declares that a 'misbranded' or 'mislabeled' product is automatically unsafe, and provides FDA with the authority to confiscate the merchandise."<p>	

Naturally, the orange juice was perfectly safe, not to mention healthy.  Dr. Kessler action was meant to send a message to American businesses that the FDA was calling the shots.<p>

<li> Bovard noted another, similar raid.  This time it wasn't orange juice, but vitamins the FDA was after: "On May 6, 1992, a platoon of sixteen FDA inspectors and local police in flak jackets carried out a no-knock raid, smashing in the door of the Tahoma Clinic in Kent, Washington.  They held the staff at gunpoint, ostensibly so that nobody could try to hide the vitamins.  The raiders seized more than $100,000 in products and office supplies -- including address books and diaries -- and spent 14 hours cleaning out the office; they even tore the phones out of the wall.  FDA agents were supposedly concerned about the clinic's use of injected B-vitamins, which have been widely used in Germany with no adverse health problems."<p>

<li> Commissioner Kessler was appointed by President George Bush.  Refusing to resign from his post under a directive given to all presidential appointees during a normal transition to a new administration, Kessler worked hard to ingratiate himself with the president-to-be with a list of aggressive regulatory actions.  On December 8, 1992, during the White House transition, Kessler offered his view of the FDA in remarks before the Food and Drug Law Institute's 36th Annual Educational Conference.  His emphasis on re-regulation and more aggressive enforcement was clear, as noted by the following excerpts:<p>"We needed to send out a message that, ultimately, it was in no one's interest to deregulate a public health regulatory agency."<p>"We're paying more attention to our field these days.  We've become once again an FDA that vigorously enforces the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, and not just an agency that approves products and educates consumers and the industry."<P>"Our enforcement people have fewer hoops to jump through, fewer boxes that must be checked off."<p>"We rely much less on voluntary agreements and much more on court-enforceable consent decrees."<p>"To complement the regular FDA field force we've created an Office of Criminal Investigations, not to be confused with the new Office of Investigations.  Thirty new special agents began intense training last week at a federal law enforcement training 	center in Georgia."<p>"In just over a year we've cleared the deck of uncompleted and abandoned regulatory proposals; we're getting new regulations out faster than ever before ..."<p>	Commissioner Kessler, of course,  kept his job.<p>

<li> This time writing in The Wall Street Journal (December 8, 1994), James Bovard observed another FDA tactic: "FDA employees are also sowing fear with a deluge of official Warning Letters (up more than 300% since Dr. Kessler took office).  Once the FDA issues a Warning Letter, it can seize a company's products or get a court injunction to paralyze its operations.  The FDA has refused to establish clear guidelines or rules for issuing its letters.  As a result, manufacturers can find themselves in a nightmare at the whim of a mid-level FDA employee."<p>

<li> In a letter to The American Spectator (April 1995), Dennis Plank, Editor-Publisher of the FDA Hotline, writes on how well federal regulatory agencies work together when it comes to regulatory crack downs: "A frightening current trend is how successful the FDA has become in pushing the buttons at other federal agencies to attack vitamin, supplement, and herbal manufacturers and suppliers.  We have reported on stepped-up enforcement actions by OSHA, FTC, Customs, Postal Service, and the DEA.  The Federal Trade Commission has now become the FDA's bully boy with no less than twenty cases pending against vitamin and natural product manufacturers."<p>

<li> One of the FDA's most aggressive moves just occurred.  It did not involve a physical raid on a company's facilities.  Instead, it amounts to the beginnings of a power raid on an entire American industry.  According to published reports, on Wednesday, July 12, 1995, the FDA declared nicotine to be a drug, linking this conclusion to concern over tobacco products being sold to minors.  	

<p>Of course, it is currently illegal to sell tobacco products to minors.  In reality, the FDA's declaration of nicotine as a drug lays the ground work for extensive control over the manufacturing and distribution of tobacco products by the FDA.  	Most recognize that smoking is bad for your health, as are so many other undertakings.  Tobacco, like other things, is a legally grown, packaged, and sold product in the United States.  What happens now that the FDA is calling nicotine a drug?  Are tobacco farmers and convenience store owners to become outlaws, part of organized crime, or perhaps pharmacists?  Are the FDA's enforcement tactics, as described above, to be extended to tobacco farms and convenience stores?  What about smokers?  The effect of the FDA calling nicotine a drug goes well beyond concern over youth smoking -- it is an issue of extending the control of the nanny state.	

<p>Indeed, why stop at nicotine?  What about other habit forming substances?  I'm overweight and enjoy drinking caffeine-laden beverages.  Will the FDA soon classify cheeseburgers, caffeine, and sugar as drugs -- how about hot dogs?<p>	

As government agencies often do, the FDA has proven to be both hypocritical and incompetent.  If Dr. Kessler and the FDA truly cared about the public's health, they would improve the efficiency of their medical device and drug approval processes.  Unfortunately, Dr. Kessler's reign seems more about control.<p>	
</ul><P>

<b>A Return to Safety Approvals and Education</b>
<P>
  The list of FDA abuses continues.  The time has come to rein in what has become largely a personal crusade. Much to the chagrin of FDA Commissioner Kessler, the FDA indeed should be "just an agency that approves products and educates consumers and the industry."  In the regulatory environment, anything more seems to breed hostility, often insurmountable costs, over-zealousness, arrogance, and massive intrusions on the part of regulators -- such as seizures of orange juice and armed raids on vitamin clinics.  The FDA's philosophy should not be one of making an example of a company in order to send a signal to other firms.  Instead, it should be one of cooperation with some of America's most dynamic and crucial industries.  	

<p>In light of potential litigation costs, lost profits, and the possibility of going out of business, firms in the medical device, food, and drug industries possess every incentive to produce safe products.  As usual, the market offers its own system of checks and balances.	

<p>Entrepreneurs in the medical device, pharmaceutical, and food industries are meeting the most essential human needs -- food and medical care.  The costs and risks of improving upon and/or creating new products in such areas remain substantial.  Unfortunately, the FDA has managed to significantly add to these costs -- not only through delays and additional regulatory requirements, but through unpredictable, intrusive actions, as touched upon in this paper.    Entrepreneurs are not the enemy; they are the driving force behind society's great leaps in technology, new products and services -- not the FDA.  	

<p>Former U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Louis Sullivan was correct when he recently observed in The Washington Times (June 27, 1995) that the FDA "seems incapable of reform."  The FDA needs to be scrapped in favor of a smaller agency geared toward safety and education, with  a food, medical device, and pharmaceutical safety approval process largely contracted out to private-sector firms.<hr>

<h3>FDA Facts: Spending More to Get Less</h3><b>by Raymond J. Keating<br>Chief Economist<br>Small Business Survival Committee</b></center><p><hr><p>

Delays in  medical device and drug approvals by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have become infamous.  As noted in the <a href="rw-fda1.html">first installment</a> in this short series, for example, new device approvals now take anywhere from 437 days to 840 days, and approvals for mere changes in existing products take an average of 173 days to 213 days.  These periods compare with the required approval times of 180 days and 90 days, respectively.  Median time for approving new drugs tops three years -- 38 months in 1993 vs. 12 months in 1986 -- with the average time stretching out even farther.  Meanwhile, the total time to develop and gain FDA approval of a new drug has risen from an average of 8.1 years in the 1960s to 14.5 years today.	When confronted with such a dismal and costly performance record, FDA defenders will say that the agency is in need of more resources.  A quick look at FDA budget and employment levels tells quite a different story.	FDA Budget.  Figure 1 provides a glimpse at the FDA's budget authority for select years since 1955 in inflation-adjusted 1994 dollars.  To say the least, budget growth at the FDA has been robust.  For example:<p>
<ul>
<li> Just from 1989 to 1994, real FDA budget authority increased by 
52.6 percent -- or by an average annual real rate of more than 10.5 percent.
<P>
<li> Between 1970 and 1994, real FDA budget authority increased by 221.1 percent.
<P>
<li> And between 1955 and 1994, the FDA's real budget authority rose by 2,978 percent.  Though the FDA's powers were enhanced considerably in the early 1960s, an average annual boost in real FDA budget dollars since 1955 of more than 76 percent cannot be justified.<p>
</ul><P>

<b>FDA Employees</b>
Figure 2 illustrates the growth in employment at the FDA.  Again, a shortage of manpower does not seem to plague the agency.  For example:<p>
<ul>
<li> Between 1989 and 1994, FDA full-time employees grew by a substantial 25.3 percent.
<P>
<li> Between 1970 and 1994, FDA full-time employees increased by 115.7 percent.
<P>
<li> And between 1955 and 1994, full-time employees at the FDA increased by 933.4 percent.	
</ul><P>

<b>Incentives Problem</b>
<P>
 Considering the great leaps in real budget authority and employment at the FDA, it would seem quite a stretch of the imagination to believe that the FDA lacks sufficient resources.  Instead, what the FDA lacks are proper incentives -- as is the case with most government undertakings.  Costs and performance in government -- unlike the private sector -- take a back seat to concerns over expanding power, budgets, and employment.   Also, given the fact that the FDA suffers when an approved product fails, but garners little attention for the woes brought on by its own delays, the agency's incentives to prolong its approval process remain clear.   Taxpayers and consumers are spending more to get less from the FDA.  FDA delays, added costs, export restrictions, narrow-minded regulations, bigger budgets, and overly aggressive regulators are costing the United States in terms of lost businesses, jobs, and even lives.  Real reform means reduced costs and improved performance.  Such an outcome can only materialize if private-sector involvement in the safety of U.S. food, drugs, and medical devices is enhanced.<p><hr><P>

<h2>Repeal the Davis-Bacon Act</h2>
<h3>by Raymond J. Keating</h3>
</center>
<hr>
<p>
"By imposing high wages and restrictive work practices on nearly any federally funded construction project, the Davis-Bacon Act costs taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars in excess construction fees every year -- and freezes tens of thousands of unskilled workers out of jobs."<p>
 
--Eugene H. Methvin, "<i>A Scandalous Law That's Costing Taxpayers Millions</i>," Reader's Digest,  December 1994
<p>
"Davis-Bacon increases costs to such an extent on federally-funded construction contracts that most small businesses are effectively precluded from bidding -- limiting competition and further raising costs for taxpayers."<p>
  --Karen Kerrigan, President, SBSC<p>
<hr>
<p>
Should the United States Congress and President Clinton repeal a regulatory act that denies opportunity to lower-income workers; panders to special interests; claims some racist origins; increases costs to taxpayers and the economy; and hurts small business?  Of course, the answer should be a resounding "yes."  The Davis-Bacon Act of 1931 does all of the above, and therefore, should be repealed.<p>
The Davis-Bacon Act requires that contractors on federally-funded construction contracts in excess of $2,000 pay workers what is termed "prevailing wage" in the region.  Supporters claim that Davis-Bacon was passed to ensure that local labor standards prevailed and local wages were not driven lower.  Most others tell another story.<p>
 
<h3>Pandering to Organized Labor and Racism</h3>

In a December 1994 Reader's Digest article, Eugene H. Methvin writes that Davis-Bacon was a "cruel relic of the Jim Crow era."  He points out that Davis-Bacon "was born in the Great	Depression year of 1931, after an Alabama contractor had submitted the low bid to build a veterans hospital on New York's Long Island and hired black laborers who had been largely shut out of the higher-wage construction unions."  New York Representative Robert L. Bacon and Pennsylvania Senator James J. Davis introduced the bill to block lower wages, and President Herbert Hoover signed it -- limiting the benefits of competition, while pandering to organized labor and racism.<p>
Just as was the case in the 1930s, low-income earners, limiting competition especially inner-city minorities, continue to be hurt by the Davis-Bacon Act.  Less-skilled, generally non-union workers are denied economic opportunity as Davis-Bacon inflates wages beyond the point where it makes economic sense for contractors to employ such inndividuals.<p>

<h3>Damaging Small Business</h3>

Small businesses are particularly hurt by the Davis-Bacon Act.  Government-determined "prevailing wages" often well exceed the actual prevailing wages in an area.  In an effort that even central planners in the former Soviet Union might have shied away from, the Department of Labor makes tens of thousands of wage determinations annually to guide Davis-Bacon contracts.  Of course, these estimates tend to be arbitrary, dated, and/or rely solely on union rates.  Many small businesses cannot afford to pay these government-imposed higher wage rates.  In particular, small businesses in inner-cities, who are willing to provide critical experience to less-skilled workers, are denied that opportunity due to government wage rates that do not reflect economic reality.<p>

In addition, the paperwork requirements associated with Davis-Bacon take a particularly heavy toll on small contractors.  In 1934, the Copeland Act was passed requiring employers on Davis-Bacon contracts to submit payroll records to the Department of Labor or contracting agency on a weekly basis.  This requirement forces many small contractors to higher additional clerical employees, invest in additional equipment, and/or alter their payroll schedules.  The result: higher costs that discourage small contractors from bidding on Davis-Bacon contracts.<p>

As these higher costs exclude many small businesses from bidding on Davis-Bacon contracts, costs to taxpayers are pushed even higher due to limited competition.<p>


<h3>Costs to Taxpayers and the Economy</h3>

This lack of competition, increased paperwork, and inflated wages, of course, translate into higher costs for taxpayers and the economy.  Various estimates of the increase in total construction costs due to the Davis-Bacon Act have been made, including:<a href="#foot1">1</a><p>
<ul>
<li>According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) in 1993, if Davis-Bacon were repealed and Copeland Act requirements lifted, federal taxpayers would have saved $3 billion over the following five years.                                                         
<li>The Department of Defense estimated in the mid-1980s that Davis-Bacon induced an added cost premium of 5 percent.
<li>In 1979, the General Accounting Office (GAO) estimated an average cost inflation of 3 percent to 10 percent tied to Davis-Bacon.
<li>Some local officials have estimated that Davis-Bacon increased the cost of various community development projects by 20 percent to 50 percent.  Also, an Oregon State University study estimated cost inflation on federally-funded construction contracts in rural areas of 26 percent to 38 percent due to the Davis-Bacon Act.
<li>The GAO and CBO estimates do not include the costs of foregone competition -- raising the total cost of Davis-Bacon even higher.
</ul>

In addition, part of the Davis-Bacon rationale was to protect local workers from contractors outside the region.  Yet, as noted in a 1986 study by Armand J. Thieblot for the Wharton School, local contractors have gained a larger share of private contracts than they do Davis-Bacon contracts.<p>

Also, the Davis-Bacon Act spawned numerous state-level imitators -- placing similar requirements on state and local government contracts.  Just as does the federal Davis-Bacon Act, these state acts raise costs for taxpayers, deny economic opportunity to many less-skilled workers, and damage small business.<p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

Wages are best determined in a competitive marketplace, not according to the unrealistic estimates from Department of Labor bureaucrats in Washington, D.C.  The market allows wages and costs to adjust according to a host of criteria, including competition, skill levels and productivity, demand, supply, capital investment, et al.  The Davis-Bacon Act's wage criteria distorts the marketplace -- artificially favoring large businesses over small, entrepreneurial firms; and higher-skilled and paid workers over less-experienced, lower-skilled workers independent of job criteria.  Costs rise; the entrepreneur suffers; unemployment increases; and taxpayers foot the bill.<p>

The Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC) supports the straightforward remedy proposed by U.S. Representative Tom Delay (R-Tx.) to the many problems created by the Davis-Bacon Act.  Rep. Delay's bill simply reads: "Davis-Bacon of March 3, 1931 (known as the Davis-Bacon Act) is repealed."<p>

Raymond J. Keating serves as economics advisor to the Small Business Survival Committee, and is the co-author of D.C. By The Numbers: A State of Failure (University Press of America, 1995)<p>

<center><h3><I>Small Business</I> Budget Watch</h3> 
<i>November 1995</i> 
<P>
<I><B>Talking Points on H.R. 2472 (Davis-Bacon Expansion)</B></I>
<hr size="3" width="45%"></center>
<UL>
<LI>H.R. 2472 expands the coverage of Davis-Bacon off-site. This
bill applies inflated Davis-Bacon wage rates to <I>&quot;laborers
and mechanics employed by the contractor or subcontractor to work
directly upon the site of the work, including work at fabrication
plants, batch plants, tool yards, rock pits, or similar facilities

... that are not located on the project site, but the principal
purpose is to provide construction materials for the project;
and laborers and mechanics employed by a contractor or subcontractor

... to transport debris, materials, supplies, and equipment to
or from the site of the work...&quot;</I> 
<P>Obviously, this will
dramatically increase the cost of federal construction as other
industries are drawn into the Davis-Bacon wage trap. This bill
also would apply Davis-Bacon to all federally-assisted construction
(presently, Davis-Bacon applies only to contracts entered into
by the federal government or through related acts). Small firms
which materially support and transport material to/from federal
projects and those who perform work on federally assisted projects
would be severely burdened by the expansion of this harmful law.
<P>
<LI>While this bill would raise the Davis-Bacon threshold to $100,000,
it fails to produce any real cost savings. Although roughly two-thirds
of the total number of federal contracts will be eliminated from
Davis-Bacon requirements, less than 4% of the dollar volume of
federal contracts will be eliminated, resulting in minuscule savings
for the taxpayer. The renovation and repair threshold, which would
apply to <I>&quot;repair, rehabilitation, reconstruction, or alteration,
including painting and decorating, of public buildings or public
works of the United States...&quot;</I> is set at $25,000 -- this
creates a bifurcated threshold, which will increase legal and
administrative burdens.
<P><LI>This bill would allow any &quot;laborer, mechanic, or organization&quot;
to petition the Secretary of Labor in order to determine the applicability
of Davis-Bacon. This provision would increase the likelihood of
legal squabbles. Many small firms cannot absorb such litigation
costs.
<P><LI>This &quot;reform&quot; does not even significantly reduce
the Davis-Bacon paperwork requirements imposed on contractors.
</UL>

<P>
This bill is not reform, it's a ploy to increase the applicability
of the Davis-Bacon Act. Actually, Davis-Bacon is not reformable
-- it has no place in American government. This law, which has
cost taxpayers billions of dollars and denied opportunity to small
firms and minority workers, can prove useful only if eliminated.
Reports of fraud indicate that as long as Davis-Bacon exists,
it will continue to impose unjust, wasteful costs on taxpayers.
Time is running out on the Davis-Bacon Act, as Congress and the
public are beginning to realize it is beyond repair.

"With high taxes and a burdensome tax system impeding the
growth and survival of small businesses, taxes will be a priority
for each and every small business person who votes on November
5," said Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC) President
Karen Kerrigan.
<P>
Kerrigan made her remarks on Capitol Hill  at a press conference
supporting the <I><B>Taxpayer Protection Pledge</B></I> -- an
effort sponsored by Americans for Tax Reform (ATR), a 60,000 member
national taxpayer organization.
<P>
"In 1992 Bill Clinton promised a middle-class tax cut, instead
middle-class small business owners got hit with the biggest tax
increase in history.  President Clinton made a campaign promise
to cut taxes, instead he raised them.  The <I><B>Pledge</B></I>
separates the true friend of the taxpayer from the big tax-and-spenders,"
said Kerrigan.
<P>
There are 2 versions of the <I>Taxpayer Protection Pledge</I>:
state and federal.  Signers of the state pledge promise to oppose
and vote against <U>any and all</U> efforts to increase taxes
while federal pledge signers promise to oppose increases in marginal
income tax rates and reductions or elimination of deductions and
credit.
<P>
 To date, GOP Presidential candidate Bob Dole, Libertarian Presidential
candidate Harry Browne, 210 U.S. House of Representatives, 35
U.S. Senators, and over 700 candidates or incumbents for state
legislators have signed the pledge.  
<P>
To find out if your congressional candidate has signed the pledge,
contact SBSC at 800-223-7526 or visit the ATR home page at <B>www.atr.org</B>.

<P>
First, a quick thank you for those of you who weighed in to help
us defeat the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), and the Employment
Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA).  As you know, both would have placed
new regulatory burdens on business.<BR>
<P>
<B>CWC</B> -- In the end, the Senate did not have enough votes
to pass the CWC so supporters decided to pull it from consideration
for ratification.  What this means is that our CWC victory is
temporary.  The bad news is that the CWC will probably rear its
ugly head next year.<BR>
<P>
<B>ENDA</B> -- The same can be said for ENDA.  While ENDA was
defeated in the Senate by only one vote, the legislation will
continue to come before the Congress as long as Ted Kennedy remains
a member of the United States Senate.  Stay tuned and prepared.
<BR>
<P>
<B>Immigration </B>-- Legislation to curb illegal immigration
will be voted on soon.  We remain strongly opposed to the voluntary
employee verification program due to the burden it will place
on employers and employees alike.  The &quot;voluntary&quot; system
will most definitely become mandatory in the future.  SBSC believes
that the new system is flawed in that it will be riddled with
errors thus delaying the hiring process.  Please call SBSC to
receive more information so you can contact your member of Congress
with your concerns.

Clinton signed several of the initiatives target to help small

<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>SBSC applauded the Congress for its passage
of health insurance reforms to help small business including the
phasing-in of deductibility to 80%, and passing Medical Savings
Accounts.  In addition, regulators are now more accountable to
small businesses because Congress put teeth into Regulatory Flexibility.
 Regulators must also publish their rules and regulations in &quot;Plain

and vote to reject them.<BR>

CALL TO ACTION: Chemical Weapons Treaty Nears Scheduled Vote
</b>
<P>
 September  6, 1996<p>
 Issue No. 20<BR>
<hr>
<P>
 The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC)<BR>
</center>
<P>
The United States' Senate has scheduled a  ratification vote of
the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) before September 14, 1996.
 
<P>
Ratification of the CWC - a treaty to supposedly end the production
and stockpiling of chemical weapons - would risk the United States'
national security,  expose U.S. private industry to international
industrial espionage, and cost U.S. private firms billions in
regulatory costs associated with treaty compliance.
<P>
The treaty risks United States' national security because rogue
nations like Iraq, Syria, Libya, and North Korea have not signed
the treaty and thus are not bound by the CWC's provisions.  For
other countries such as Russia and China who are signatories,
their ratification of CWC is uncertain.
<P>
Secondly, treaty compliance would be difficult to ascertain. 
Former Central Intelligence Agency James Woolsey, stated before
the Foreign Relations Committee in June 1994 that &quot;The chemical
weapons problem is so difficult from an intelligence perspective
that I cannot state that we have high confidence in our ability
to detect noncompliance, especially on a small scale.&quot;  
<P>
<U>The CWC is a nonverifiable, nonenforceable treaty.</U>  The
United States would set a dangerous precedence ratifying the CWC
given that the treaty's provisions would strip the United States
of its ability to protect itself,  while allowing nations  hostile
to U.S. forces the ability to continue their production of chemical
weapons unabated.  
<P>
 In order to detect the production of chemical weapons, the treaty
institutes <U>a time-consuming verification program that is applicable
to a wide range of U.S. companies, that use certain chemicals
in the manufacturing process including - pharmaceutical companies,
textile mills,  paint manufacturers, food processing companies,
breweries, and distilleries.  </U>  The verification system  assigns
regulated chemicals  to &quot;schedules&quot; based upon what
is believed to be their relative usefulness for chemical weapons
production.  Each schedule has reporting requirements which include
copious amount of paperworks for each chemical and inspection
liabilities for the producing and consuming firms.  The U.S. Department
of Commerce estimates that filling out the paperwork will take
anywhere from 2.5 - 9 hours for <B>each</B> chemical depending
on its schedule classification.  
<P>
Instead of committing precious hours to operating a profitable
firm, business owners - many of whom are small business owners
- would be required to spend countless hours filling out paperwork
to prove that a chemical regulated by the treaty is used for their
legitimate business purposes.   
<P>
The CWC would be the first treaty in U.S. history to subject U.S.
industry to international authority.  
<P>
There would be 2 kinds of inspection: routine and challenge. 
Routine inspections would be directed at sites producing chemicals
that are perceived to present the greatest risk of diversion to
weapons use.  A firm could be subject to up to 20 routine inspections
per year.    Challenge inspections would be conducted when requested
and can take place within a 12 hour notification period.  There
is no limit on the number of challenge inspections a firm can
be subjected to.  
<P>
Inspectors would be permitted to interview site personnel, inspect
records, photograph on-site apparatus, take samples, record equipment
readings and use instruments to monitor processes.  <U>The company
 would be expected to comply completely with the inspectors' demands.
 The company is  also responsible for bearing the full cost of
the inspection - including  meals and lodging of the inspectors,
as part of the &quot;cost of doing business&quot; in chemicals.
 The Defense Department estimates that U.S. private industry would
pay anywhere from $10,000 to $500,000 for &quot;hosting&quot;
each inspection.  </U>
<P>
The figures given are just an estimate, but the cost to business
could be substantial given the costs associated with the loss
of confidential, proprietary information.  Furthermore, distinct
possibilities exist that due process rights could be violated
in relation to warrantless searches and personnel being compelled
to answer questions, and provide information and access.  
<P>
SBSC President Karen Kerrigan asserted, &quot;By all accounts,
the treaty is flawed, and we strongly urge the U.S. Senate to
take a sober look at the CWC.  We believe an honest assessment
of the treaty will reveal that the costs to U.S. businesses, the
loss of our economic freedom, and the compromising of rights protected
by the United States Constitution do not justify ratification
- especially since the treaty will threaten United States' national
security.&quot; 
<P>
<B>Please call or write your Senators immediately and urge them
to oppose ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention.  </B>A
sample letter follows:  <BR>
<P>
<I>Dear Senator:<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>I urge you to oppose ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention
(CWC) when it is considered by the Senate in September.</I>
<P>
<I>Chemical weapons can be inexpensively and secretly manufactured
and no treaty is going to change that fact.</I>
<P>
<I>What this treaty will do is make it significantly harder for
thousands of Americans to operate their businesses.  Small businesses
- unable to afford the thousands of dollars involved in new paperwork
- will be especially hard hit by the CWC's regulatory and administrative
requirements. The loss of trade secrets will add countless loses
to business operations.  Our economy will suffer irreparable harm.</I>
<P>
<I>Please vote to spare American businesses this unjustifiable
burden by defeating the Chemical Weapons Convention</I>.

 <B>Less Government, Less Taxes, More Freedom<BR>

<P>
1994 saw a record number of entrepreneurs and successful small
business people elected to Congress.  
<P>
 With 32 of 86 Congressional freshman former (or current) small
business owners heralding the economic advantages of small business
growth, the 104th Congress shifted from an anti-business to a
pro-entrepreneur agenda.   See Congress Becoming More Friendly
to Small Business.
<P>
Small-business Congress members have helped lawmakers focus on
fiscal and tax policies that aid small businesses in creating
new job opportunities for Americans.   
<P>
According to a 1995 March U.S. News &amp; World Report, there
are now 191 representatives who used to work in business-related
occupations, compared with 170 who worked in law.  
<P>
 This week <I>Small Business Hill Alert </I>highlights a speech
by small business woman, Sue Wittig, a candidate for New York's
 26th congressional district.   Ms. Wittig's speech typifies SBSC's
freemarket, limited government ideology. 
<P>
Sue Wittig's address was delivered to GOP delegates at the Republican
convention on August 12th, 1996.  <BR>
<P>
<I>My name is Sue Wittig, and I'm running for Congress.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>I'm a small business woman from Saugerties, New York.  Along
with my husband, I run a paint and wallpaper store, a family business
that was started by my Dad over thirty years ago...<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>Together with my Mom, [my Dad] built a business - and a family.
 And [he] taught me the value of both.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>We need representatives who understand the value of families...
<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>We need representatives who understand the marketplace.  It
is the small businesses of Newburgh, Kingston, Ithaca, and Owego
who are creating tomorrow's jobs.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>We need representatives who understand limited government.
 Congress was designed to be a citizen Legislature, for people
to ..., serve their community and country, and</I> <B>go back
home</B><I>.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>...From the small business owners...and the mothers and fathers
struggling to pay their taxes ....<BR>

<CENTER><B>Time to Overhaul the NLRB <BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
The Small Business Survival (SBS) Foundation released a new <I><B>Small
Business Reg Watch</B></I>  documenting the bias of the National
Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and its interpretation of labor law.
 The report also outlines reform measures to move  labor law and
the NLRB into the 21st century.
<P>
According to the study entitled &quot;Time to Overhaul Labor Law
and the NLRB,&quot; the NLRB has taken judicial activism to the
extreme - blatant political NLRB decisions have been consistently
reversed by the courts who hear such cases.  In addition, current
NLRB Chairman William Gould has publicly stated his support or
opposition to various pieces of legislation before Congress -
an act that is unprecedented for what is supposed to be an impartial
arbritor of labor law.
<P>
For a copy of the study, call SBS Foundation at 1-800-223-7526

<P>
The 104th Congress has improved markedly over the previous Congress
in terms of its votes on legislation to help small business and
enhance entrepreneurship. 
<P>
 &quot;Especially during its first term, the 104th Congress was
enthusiastically pro-entrepreneur.  Tax and regulatory relief
legislation, combined with proposals to cut the size and scope
of government all comprise the small business agenda,&quot; said
SBSC President Karen Kerrigan.
<P>
Kerrigan continued, &quot;The change in Congress marked a tremendous
shift in the direction of the small business agenda on Capitol
Hill.  Rather than small business being on the defensive, we were
able to consistently support legislation being considered on the
floor of both Houses.&quot;
<P>
 However, while Congress passed an unprecedented level of legislation
supported by small businesses and entrepreneurs, these measures
were largely vetoed by President Clinton.
<P>
&quot;Unfortunately, the bulk of legislation aimed towards the
growth and survival of small business was rejected by the President,&quot;
Kerrigan noted.
<P>
At the time of the release of SBSC's <I>Ratings of the 104th Congress</I>,
Congress was preparing to send the minimum wage hike amendment
to the President's desk for approval. 
<P>
The ratings were completed prior to the wage hike vote.  Its consideration
would have proven damaging for many members ratings.
<P>

<P>
<B> The Dole Economic Plan and the Entrepreneur<BR>
</B>
</center>
<P>
With the announcement of the Dole economic plan, tax cuts are
back on the front burner of the nation's public policy debate.
 And though one can find all sorts of opinions on whether this
is a good or bad thing, from the perspective of small business,
entrepreneurship, and economic growth, the major proposals put
forth in the Dole plan make for sound economic policy.<BR>
<P>
<ul>
<li> <U>Cutting the capital gains tax.</U>  The Dole plan calls
for a 50 percent cut in the top capital gains tax rate on individuals
from 28 percent to 14 percent.  <BR>
</ul>
<P>
Barring a complete tax overhaul, there is no tax cut that will
do more to spur entrepreneurship, investment,economic growth,
and job creation than a sharp reduction in the capital gains tax
rate.  The great hurdle to starting up and/or expanding a business
remains access to capital.  Investing and entrepreneurship are
high&#173;risk endeavors.  High risks require the opportunity
for substantial returns.  Slash the capital gains tax in half
and you enhance the potential returns from risk&#173;taking.<BR>
<P>
A 50 percent reduction in the capital gains tax rate would provide
a major boost to small business, entrepreneurship, and the economy.
<BR>
<P>
<ul>
<li> <U>Across&#173;the&#173;board cut in personal income taxes.</U>
 A 15 percent across&#173;the&#173;board cut in personal income
tax rates works favorably for small business and the economy in
three key ways:<BR>
<ul>
<P>
1) Boosts incentives for individuals to work, save, invest, and
take risks.  Again, this is a straightforward relative price argument
&#173;&#173;as the old saying goes, the less you tax something,
the more of it you get.<BR>
<P>
2) Resources are shifted from the unproductive sphere of government
to the productive private sector.  Or another way to put it, individuals
operating in the private marketplace spend and invest their money
far more efficiently and wisely than do government bureaucrats.
<BR>
<P>
3) Since about 79 percent of all business tax returns are either
sole proprietorships or partnerships (the other 21 percent being
corporations), then an across&#173;the&#173;board personal income
tax cut directly impacts the bottom line of millions of U.S. businesses.
 Lower taxes mean more funds available for capital investment,
additional employees, et al. <BR>
</ul>
<P>
<li> <U>Additional measures.</U>  The Dole plan calls for other
tax cuts and reforms impacting small businesses and entrepreneurs,
including: <BR>
<ul>
<P>
&#173;<I>Unrestricted tax&#173;free medical savings accounts (MSAs)
and 100 percent deductibility for health insurance for the self&#173;employed.</I>
 MSAs inject choice and accountability into the health&#173;care
system, and 100 percent deductibility places all businesses on
an equal plain in terms of the tax treatment of health care expenses.
<BR>
<P>
&#173;<I>Estate tax reductions</I>.  The estate tax amount to
nothing more than a government hostile takeover of family businesses.
 All cuts in the estate tax are welcome, hopefully on the path
to complete repeal of the estate tax.<BR>
<P>
&#173;<I>Repeal of the 1993 tax increase on Social Security beneficiaries.</I>
 Again, this will boost incentives to work and keep resources
in the private sector.<BR>
<P>
&#173;<I>Expanded IRAs and institution of spousal IRAs</I>.  Such
measures will boost incentives to save and expand loanable funds
available to business.<BR>
<P>
&#173;<I>Regulatory reform.</I>  Requiring peer&#173;reviewed,
science&#173;based risk assessment and cost benefit analysis for
new regulations, regulatory review of all new regulations every
four years, and a task force to review and recommend sunsetting
ineffective and costly regulations, all point toward gaining some
much&#173;needed control over a federal regulatory apparatus strangling
businesses, investment, and entrepreneurship.<BR>
<P>
&#173;<I>Legal reform.</I>  Measures such as limiting punitive
damages in most cases, abolishing joint and several liability
for non&#173;economic damages in civil cases, and curbing contingency
fee abuses, all amount to a good start at alleviating many of
the burdensome costs of our legal system that damage or destroy
countless businesses and the jobs they create.<BR>
</ul>
</ul>
<P>
U.S. businesses and entrepreneurs need tax cuts, regulatory relief,
and legal reform.  The cost of government is massive, inhibiting
new business formation, economic growth, and job creation.  Once
fully implemented, the proposals in the Dole economic plan would:
<BR>
<P>
<ul>
<li> Increase incentives for working, saving, investing, and
entrepreneurship.<BR>
<P>
<li> Boost rates of economic growth and job creation.<BR>
<P>
<li> Help both equity and bond markets, as incentives for investment
are enhanced and faster economic growth eases inflation threats
(assuming sound monetary policy).  After all, inflation results
from too much money chasing too few goods &#173;&#173;faster growth
means more goods and services.<BR>
</ul>
<P>
<B>The bottom line is: Tax cuts help small businesses and entrepreneurs.

<h3>An Action Alert to Advance the Small Business Agenda on Capitol Hill</h3><p>
<i>July  29, 1996 <p>
Issue No. 17</i><p></center><p>
<i><center> Call to Action : Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC),  Institute for Justice Study Participation</i></center>

<hr>
 <center><h2>Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC)</center></h2><p>

<u><b>On or before, September 14</u></b>, the Senate will consider ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), a treaty that is supposed to ban the stockpiling and production of chemical weapons.   <p>
Grave  concerns about  the treaty's effectiveness, and its cost  to  national security and business have been raised by defense and policy experts.  <p>
<b>One of the biggest concerns regarding ratification of the CWC is the threat to national security.</b>  Few countries possessing chemical weapons are likely to cease buildup of their chemical weapons program because of the treaty.  In fact, six of fourteen countries suspected by the U.S. of possessing chemical weapons have not signed the treaty.  <p>
Rogue nations like Libya, North Korea, Iraq, and Syria continue production of chemical weapons unabated while China and Russia  - countries with the largest chemical weapons arsenal in the world - provide inconsistent and contradictory data on their chemical weapons program.  <p>
CWC poses a threat to national security because noncompliance can not be easily detected.  Since the CWC allows ample time for inspected facilities to conceal their activities,  noncompliance  would be impossible to detect.   Former Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), James Woolsey, testified that the CIA lacks high confidence in our ability to detect noncompliance, especially on a small scale.  Noncompliance is therefore unverifiable.  <p>
Signing and ratifying a treaty which is unverifiable sets a dangerous precedent for future arms control agreements and threatens the United States national security.  <p>
<u><b>Another major concern regarding CWC ratification is the direct and indirect cost to U.S. industry.</u></b>   Under the treaty, U.S. private industry would be subject to foreign inspection, thus exposing American businesses to the real threat of international industrial espionage.  Long-held trade secrets and other proprietary information could be compromised in a matter of seconds.  International inspectors  located in the Hague, Netherlands would be responsible for carrying out inspections of U.S. companies.<p>
In addition, American firms - such as distilleries,  breweries, and insecticide, pharmaceutical, ceramic, nylon, paint, textile, soap, detergent, and electronic manufacturers  -  which produce or use a scheduled chemical  would be required to fill out additional paperwork under a new four-tiered process.  (The additional regulatory burden is estimated to take administrators 9 hours for every Schedule 1 chemical, 7.2 hours for every Schedule 2 chemical, 5.3 hours for each Organic Chemical and 2.5 hours for every Schedule 3 chemicals.) <p>
It is estimated that roughly 8,000 businesses currently do not have compliance mechanisms in place.  These businesses and smaller businesses will be hardest hit by the increased regulatory burdens treaty ratification will bring.  (Past studies have shown that the per employee cost of federal regulations is 50% higher for firms with fewer than 500 employees.)  Right now it is estimated that the cost of hosting an inspection is $10,000.  If the inspection is challenged, the cost could be $200,000 - $500,000.   
The CWC is riddled with problems that should concern all Americans.  It will be voted on by mid-September.  Please call or write your United States Senators immediately and tell them not to ratify the CWC in its current form. A sample letter follows:<p>

<i>The Honorable ______<br>
United States Senate<br>
Washington, D.C.  20510<p>

Dear Senator _______:<p>

I am writing to express my serious concerns with the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).  The CWC, in its current form, will seriously damage United States national security and impose a massive, new regulatory burden upon thousands of U.S. businesses.<p>
The CWC will do nothing to reduce the chemical weapon arsenals of terrorist countries and other nations hostile to the United States.  In fact several countries of most concern to the United States have not signed or ratified the treaty.  <p>
I am also concerned with the treaty because it  is unverifiable. Former Central Intelligence Agency Director, James Woolsey, testified that noncompliance of the treaty will be virtually impossible to detect.  
And finally, ratification of the treaty will create another bureaucracy costing U.S. taxpayers millions of dollars and imposing costly regulatory burdens on thousands of U.S. companies.<p>
I urge you to preserve our national security and protect U.S. businesses by voting against ratification of the CWC.<p>

For more information on the CWC, please call SBSC at 800-223-7526.<p>

 The Institute for Justice, a nationally acclaimed public interest law firm, is currently analyzing six cities across the U.S. for  government-created barriers to entrepreneurial opportunities.  The study focuses on the following areas: transportation; hairbraiding and cosmetology; newsstands; daycare; recycling and street vending (pushcarts, foot peddlers, truck peddlers).   Institute for Justice staff will be in Baltimore,  Detroit, Charlotte, Boston, San Diego, and San Antonio looking for small business owners  who would like to  participate.  If you would like to take part in the study, please contact Nina Shokraii, Director of Outreach at the Institute for Justice.  Ms. Shokraii's number is 202-955-1300.

<b>Davis Bacon Update<p></b>

Recently, the Coalition to Repeal Davis-
Bacon met privately with Oklahoma 
Department of Labor Commissioner, Brenda 
Renau.  At issue were cases of fraud and 
abuse that she and her team of investigators 
have discovered.  Because of the U.S. 
Department of Labor's unwillingness to 
cooperate in reform, it is likely that more 
cases of abuse are entrenched throughout the 
U.S.  The Congressional Budget Office 
estimates that $7.3 billion in government 
funds could be save in just five years 
without the act which establishes "prevailing 
wages"that employers must pay, usually at 
much higher-than-market prices.  Call 
Representative William F. Clinger, Jr., chair 
     of the House Oversight Committee at     
202-225-5074 to voice your concern.<p>

<b>Starting Wage Hike<p></b>

As you now, both the House and Senate 
recently voted to mandate an increase in the 
starting wage by $.90.  The Senate measure 
is strikingly similar to its House counterpart 
but includes a number of tax breaks for 
small businesses, among them: an increase 
in the spending limit of small businesses 
under Section 179 from $17,500 to $25,000; 
a simplified pension plan for small business 
employers; and deductible contributions to 
individual retirement accounts by non-
working spouses.  Since the bill is not in its 
final stage however, Sen Kennedy and 
others anti-business congressmen are still 
threats.  An amendment offered by Sen. 
Kennedy that would have shortened the 
duration of the subminimum wage ($4.25) 
from 90 days to 30 days failed.  Call your 
Senator or Representative to express your 
strong desire that the small business tax 
credits stay in the bill despite any last 
minute deals by Sen. Kennedy and the like.  
We must remain vigilant if we are to prevail. <p>

<b><a href="http://politicsusa.com/cvc">CAFE Standards</a></b><p>

The CAFE standards will prove to be a hot topic 
on the Hill later this summer.  If President 
Clinton has his way and the standards are 
increased, small business owners could see a 
dramatic increase in the cost of doing business.  
Please write or call President Clinton to express 
your support for the current CAFE standards.  
The following is a sample letter to serve you as 
a guide.<p>

Sample Letter to the White House<br>
Small Business Owner<p>
Sample #1<p>

President William J. Clinton<br>
The White House<br>
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW<br>
Washington, D.C.  20500<p>

Dear President Clinton:<p>

In the last election, voters sent a message to 
Washington:  "Cut excessive Government 
regulation."  As a small business owner, I can 
tell you how important that is.<p>

Several recent news articles blamed the owners 
of light trucks for recent gas price increases.  
They also suggested the answer was increased 
governmental regulation of motor vehicle fuel 
economy.  I disagree.<p>

Higher gas mileage standards would hurt small 
business owners in two ways.  First, the price of 
the larger pickups and vans like we use would 
probably go up to encourage sales of smaller 
vehicles.  Or the manufacturers would have to 
reduce the size and weight of those vehicles-- 
which means I'd have to buy an even bigger, 
more expensive vehicle than I need to support 
my business.<p>

President Clinton, don't let that happen.  We 
need less regulation, not more.  Say that you 
will leave vehicle fuel economy standards right 
where they are.<p>

Sincerely,<p>
<p><br>

At the June 5 press conference, SBSC President Karen Kerrigan
stated, &quot;The President has been given ample opportunity to
support the small business agenda...it is clear that he continues

of the economy, rather than the entrepreneur.&quot;<BR>
<P>

<P>
Marking the start of National Small Business Week, the Small Business
Survival Foundation formally released a report that provides a
measure of government-related costs affecting the business decisions
of investors, entrepreneurs, and businesses across the United
States.  The report, the <B>Small Business Survival Index</B>,
combines nine major costs (whether rates, ratios, or indexes)
levied on small businesses and entrepreneurs into one comparative
index number.  <BR>

</B></CENTER>
<P>
 All businesses <FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">,</FONT> including
small businesses <FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">,</FONT> face additional
regulations through the proposed adoption of the employment verification
measure.  It passed in both the House and Senate versions of the
immigration proposals. San Diego employers currently using a toll-free
verification system similar to House measure report that the system
can take up to &quot;three calls, several minutes, and sometimes
several days to verify a Social Security number...&quot;  At this
point, the verification system will be voluntary, but SBSC believes
it will eventually become mandatory.
<P>
SBSC's position:  The verification system does not recognize the
administrative and regulatory burdens associated with operating
a business.  Illegal immigrants who show remarkable deftness at
skirting U.S. laws will continue to do so even under the system.
 Hence, the law-abiding employer using the proposed system (and
American citizens) will be the only persons &quot;caught&quot;
by this intrusive system.
<P>
       <B> Time still exists to make your voices heard</B>.  Call
your Representatives and Senators, tell them to say no to additional
regulations  -- &quot;voluntary&quot; or not.<BR>
<P>
<CENTER><B>Starting Wage Proposal in the Senate <BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
The Senate will soon offer their version of the starting wage
bill.  It is expected to closely parallel the House proposal and
increase the starting wage by $0.90 by 1997.  The following provisions
have been added: (1) tipped employees would have the federal cash
wage frozen at $2.13 per hour, instead of 50 percent of the current
federal starting wage and (2) new hires would be paid an &quot;opportunity
wage&quot; during their first 90 calendar days of employment.
 
<P>
It is probable that Senator Kennedy will offer an amendment to
strip these provisions - thereby attempting to force a straight
starting wage bill with the $0.90 increase.  
<P>
<B>Small business owners still have time to weigh-in with the
Senators.   </B>Let them know that you oppose any increase in
the starting wage, but if an increase is unavoidable, then include
the small-business provisions passed by the House.  <U>Most importantly,
tell your Senators not to support any amendment that strips the
tip credit or the opportunity wage language.<BR>

<B>The Budget That Won't Go Away, Tax System Overhaul Gets Another Boost</B></center>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<b>Backed Into a Corner?</b>
<P>
If the budget negotiations were to be decided by who has 
compromised more, the Republicans would be victorious.  
The GOP Congress has compromised $68.5 billion more 
than President Clinton since the beginning of budget talks, 
as the chart below outlines.  (Budget figures are the most 
recent offers of 1/9/96 in billions of dollars.)
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<PRE>
	GOP Compromise		Clinton Compromise

Medicare	+ $58		- $27

Medicaid	+ $48		- $22

Welfare		+$3.5		- $3

EITC		+ $12		- $3

Tax Cuts	- $51		+ $20

Discretionary	+ $60		- $89
---------------------------------------------------<P>
$232.5 toward the Pres.		$164 toward Congress
</pre>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
The Republicans have compromised more than the  
President in every disputed area with the exception of 
discretionary spending.  The President's latest tax cut 
proposal, which does not provide for a cut in capital gains 
taxes, shows that he has moved less than half than the GOP 
in the area of tax reduction.
<P>
Recent reports suggest that a capital gains tax cut is likely to 
be included in a budget deal.  The Clinton Administration 
may formally propose a 7.5% cut in the cap gains rate for 
individuals with a 17.5% cut for Americans in the lowest tax 
bracket.  Separately, Congressional Democrats have 
continued to rail against a cap gains tax cut, and Vice 
President Gore reportedly has said that opposition to cuts in 
cap gains taxes was "a theological issue" for Democrats.
<P>
Language within the first continuing resolution (CR) to fund 
parts of the government allowed for "protecting our 
priorities" -- which may well mean increased spending 
levels for those politically sensitive areas the President does 
not want to cut.  That vague language has come back to 
haunt the GOP and other proponents of meaningful spending 
and tax reduction.  And, it appears that the compromises by 
the GOP have gone unnoticed.  Republican leaders have 
suspended the budget negotiations, denying them airtime to 
advance their position on the negotiations.  Pres. Clinton 
will use the State of the Union address on January 23 to try 
to bolster his.  Republicans may attempt to move forward by 
enlisting the help of conservative and moderate Democrats, 
though some GOP leaders (including Newt Gingrich) doubt 
that a budget agreement can be reached this year.
<P>
<b>Kemp Commission Points the Way to Tax Reform</b>
<P>
Citing the current tax code's "oppressiveness," "complexity," 
and "intrusiveness," the National Commission on Economic 
Growth and Tax Reform - chaired by former Congressman 
and HUD Secretary Jack Kemp - recommended scrapping 
the entire code.  The Commission advocated a new 
beginning for the American tax code, and laid out a set of 
principles to advance strong economic growth, small 
business expansion, and job creation.  House Speaker Newt 
Gingrich (R-GA) and Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole (R-
KS) voiced support for the findings of the Commission.
<P>
Despite a lack of specificity in its final report, the 
Commission has established a strong, meaningful start for 
tax reform.  The Commission called for a flat, fair tax rate 
that embraces simplicity and stability.  The 
recommendations pointed toward abolishment of capital 
gains taxes, full deductibility of the federal payroll tax, an 
end to double taxation, a two-thirds majority to raise the flat 
rate, and expensing of investment outlays.
<P>
The crux of the Commission's report is that the tax code 
should be submissive to the public, particularly small 
business owners.  An unruly IRS is no longer tolerable.  
There is little doubt that the findings of the Commission 
fulfill promises of tax system overhaul, and SBSC supports 
the general guiding principles of the Commission.  As noted 
in an SBSC press statement, however, the report: "is not 
long on details.  Now comes the heavy lifting of making 
detailed, principled tax overhaul a reality."
<P>
Although the Commission recommended including a 
generous personal exemption in tax reform proposals, critics 
attacked the report's embracing of a fair flat tax rate as a 
giveaway to the rich (surprise, surprise).
<p>
The Commission's report is expected to have an  impact on 
current tax reform proposals in Congress.  One leading 
Republican, House Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer 
(R-TX), was critical of the Kemp Commission's findings.  
Archer supports a tax based solely on consumption and felt 
the report said nothing new.

<B>Budget Politics, the Numbers Game, and Minimum Wage Follies</B>
<P>
<U><B>&quot;Serious&quot; Budget Talks to Get Underway</B></U>
</center>
<P><hr>
<P>
<I>The New York Times</I> has reported that budget officials expect
to strike a deal by Friday (December 22).  The budget negotiations
began late November, and since that time little progress has been
made in deciding our country's fiscal fate for the next seven
years.  Unfortunately, it has been &quot;politics-as-usual&quot;
at the negotiation table, particularly for the Clinton Administration.
 As the federal debt approaches a massive $5 trillion dollars
with annual deficits of $192 billion (and as anemic economic growth
continues), you would think circumstances would dictate substantive
spending cuts.  Instead, secretive budget negotiations have us
asking whether Santa will bring us a seven-year balanced budget
with pro-growth tax cuts.  Bah Humbug.
<P>
<B>CBO: How Many Billions Can We Spare?</B>
<P>
Recently, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released its revised
economic projections - the result of a compromise between President
Clinton and Republican Congressional leaders.  The latest CBO
numbers paint a more positive forecast for the U.S. economy, and
the CBO projects that under the Republican plan, an additional
$135 billion in revenues will be available by 2002.  Washington
insiders rejoiced at this news.  The Administration budget negotiating
team felt that the additional $135 billion would bring Congressional
Republicans closer to the President's spending demands.  Economic
forecasts have failed to live up to expectations in the past.
 While CBO numbers are the most accurate, SBSC was disappointed
that the &quot;expected&quot; additional revenues will be sacrificed
on the negotiating table instead of applied to spending cuts --
which means tax cuts will more than likely be sacrificed as well.
<P>
The more Republicans negotiate behind closed doors with the Clinton
Administration, the more we are likely to see the President's
type of &quot;investments&quot; emerge- a code word for more spending.
 The gross federal debt is over 70% of the Gross Domestic Product
($4.96 trillion).
<P>
<B>MESSAGE TO CONGRESS: Invest in the Future By Cutting Spending
Now and Giving America $245 Billion in Tax Cuts.</B>
<P>
<B>The Minimum Wage Hike Returns</B>
<P>
President Clinton included a minimum wage hike in his recently
proposed budget.  The President proposes to raise the minimum
wage to $5.15 (a 21% increase) by July 1, 1997, with an interim
increase to $4.70 in July, 1996.  President Clinton's proposal
is driven by  politics  rather than economics.  As one of his
officials said earlier this year: &quot;There are few of us who
actually think it is good economic policy, but more than a few
think it might be good politics.&quot;
<P>
An increase to the minimum wage is definitely not 'good economic
policy.'  Numerous studies and sources, including the General
Accounting Office  and Brookings Institution, have concluded that
a 10% increase in the minimum wage results in a 1%-2% decline
in overall entry-level employment.  <I>President Clinton's proposal
is  projected to cost 400,000 jobs.</I>
<P>
Only 4.7% of the workforce earns the minimum wage.  Minimum wage
workers are four times more likely to be young, single, and inexperienced
when compared to other hourly employees.  Economists estimate
that only about 11% of minimum wage increases go to individuals
at or below the level of poverty.
<P>
The President's proposal should be treated for what it is - an
unfunded mandate for America's small business owners.  Considering
63% of minimum wage workers get a raise within twelve months (with
an average wage increase of 20%), wage rates would be better left
to small business owners - rather than the President.
<P>
<B>MESSAGE TO CONGRESS: No More Unfunded Mandates Like Minimum
Wage Hikes- Cut Regulations and Taxes For the Best Pay Increase.</B>

<B>Public Voices Support for Seven-Year, Tax-Cutting Balanced
Budget &amp; The Case for Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs)</B>
<P>
<B>Poll Indicates Voter Support for a Seven-Year Balanced Budget
with Tax Relief</B></center>
<P><hr>
<P>
After hearing some of the provisions of the Republicans' seven-year
balanced budget, 57% of those polled said that they had a very
positive/somewhat positive impression of the plan, according to
a poll commissioned by The Coalition for America's Future and
Coalition for a Balanced Budget: 7,200 voters were surveyed between
Nov. 29-Dec. 2.  86% said that the Congress and President Clinton
should deal with the federal budget issue this year: 47% percent
of those surveyed support a balanced budget with spending cuts
<i>and tax relief</i> compared to 39% who support a balanced budget
without tax relief.
<P>
<B>Financial Officers, Greenspan Point to the Need for a Balanced
Budget</B>
<P>
A poll of chief financial officers by the Financial Executives
Institute (FEI) found strong support for a balanced federal budget.
 FEI stated that a balanced federal budget this year will prevent
increased interest rates, falling stock prices, reduced sales,
and higher unemployment.  77% of the financial chiefs said the
economy would take a downturn if there is a failure to reach a
budget agreement this year.
<P>
Similarly, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told Capitol
Hill that the recent fall in interest rates, which lowers mortgage
rates and boosts housing and automobile sales, was caused by the
market's anticipation of an agreement between the president and
Congress to balance the budget over a determined period of time.
<P>
<B>ACTION ITEM: Continue to Contact your Member of Congress in
Support of a Seven-Year Balanced Budget with Tax Cuts.</B>
<P>
<B>Medical Savings Accounts - Good for Small Business and Health
Care</B>
<P>
Tax-free medical savings accounts (MSAs), which have been praised
by the many businesses that have adopted them as the health care
vehicle for employees, are included in the GOP's Balanced Budget
Act.  MSAs end burdensome paperwork requirements for consumers,
doctors and insurance companies.  And MSAs are portable - each
MSA plan belongs to the employee.  The market dynamics of MSAs
inject cost-consciousness into the health care system.  Thus,
MSAs directly benefit small businesses constantly faced with spiraling
health care costs.
<P>
The congressional budget plan allows MSA tax-free savings of up
to $2,000 for an individual and $4,000 for a family.  The accumulated
interest is not taxed under the Balanced Budget Act.  There is
a 10 percent penalty for non-medical withdrawals to MSAs.  (Please
call SBSC for more information on MSAs and how they work.)
<P>
<I>Concord Management, a real estate management firm which employs
nine people, uses MSAs as a health plan.  One Concord employee,
Richard Norton, suffers from asthma.  After obtaining his MSA,
Norton shopped around for the cheapest asthma medication.  Consequently,
he now pays one-fourth the amount of the medication provided by
his employer under Blue Cross and Blue Shield coverage.  At the
end of the year, Norton received a check for $750 -- the unspent
balance in his $1,500 MSA.</I>
<P>
The GOP budget plan includes medical savings accounts.  The president's
plan, offered on Wednesday, does not.
<P>
<B>ACTION ITEM: Write or Call (202-456-1111) President Clinton
to Include MSAs in the Budget Package. (fax: 202-456-2461, e-mail:

<P>
<B>The Congress' Balanced Budget Act Addresses the Security of
Family-Owned Businesses and Spiraling Growth of Entitlement Programs</B><P>
<B>Why We Must Cut Estate Taxes</B></center>
<P><hr>
<P>
One of the biggest obstacles to the generational transfer of family-owned
businesses is the estate or inheritance tax.  Approximately 60
percent of family-owned businesses fail to make it to the second
generation, and 90 percent do not make it to the third generation.
 Are estate taxes the cause?  They are a major contributor.  Nine
out of ten successors to a family-owned business cited trouble
paying estate taxes according to a 1993 survey.  Family-owned
businesses generate about 60 percent of our GDP, and during the
1980s they were essential to the increase of more than 20 million
private sector jobs.
<P>
The Republican budget would &quot;phase-up&quot; the estate tax
exemption from $600,000 to $750,000 each year from 1996-2001.
 The Budget Act would begin factoring in inflation after 2000,
and provide for a total amount of exclusion per decedent for qualified
family-owned business interests equal to $1.75 million.  Although
the modifications stop short of a repeal of the estate tax, SBSC
was pleased to have seen the Congress take steps to turn back
the harmful effects of the inheritance tax.
<P>
It is ludicrous that government claims under the estate tax up
to 55 percent (or any percent) of an individual's assets upon
death, considering that individual had established a business,
worked hard, and paid taxes over a lifetime.  What is even more
ludicrous is the fact that this act of class envy is a big money
loser for the government!  In 1994, estate and gift taxes accounted
for a mere 1.2% of total federal receipts ($15.2 billion).  At
least 75% of that revenue is eaten up by compliance and litigation
costs of the IRS and Treasury.
<P>
A cut in the estate tax, besides being morally correct, is good
for the economy.  A 1993 study estimated that without an estate
tax by the year 2000, the GDP would be $79.2 billion higher, 228,000
more jobs would be created, and $630 billion more in savings and
capital would accumulate.
<P>
<B>MESSAGE TO CONGRESS: Don't Give in to Class Warfare Rhetoric!
 Stand by the pro-job, pro-growth Estate Tax Cuts</B>
<P>
Capitol Hill Switchboard 202-225-3121
<P>
<B>&quot;Cutting&quot; Medicare and Medicaid</B>
<P>
Unless the President and Congress tame Medicare and Medicaid spending,
the two programs will eventually consume all federal revenues
and/or collapse.  If left on present course, entitlements and
interest on the debt will devour all federal revenues by 2012.
 Medicare and Medicaid are the fastest growing entitlement programs.
<P>
The Republican plan proposes to cut the <i>growth</i> of Medicare
and Medicaid, not the actual programs.  Yet this fact has been
deafened by shear political demagoguery.  The plan would hold
the growth of Medicaid to 5.2% and the growth of Medicare to 7.2%.
 The programs would still experience a major funding increase
between now and 2002.  Medicare outlays would increase from $158
billion to $244 billion.  The chart below illustrates the growth
differences between the Republican plan and the status quo. (CBO
estimates)<HR>

<P>
If left untouched, payroll taxes would have to be hiked to 4.23%
(from 2.9%) in order to preserve Medicare over the next 25 years.
 Cuts in the growth of these two entitlement programs are necessary
if we intend to restore America's fiscal security.  Politics should
not get in the way of reforming these programs.
<P>
<B>MESSAGE TO CONGRESS: Medicare and Medicaid Spending are out
of Control - Americans Know the Difference between a Real Cut
and a Cut in the Growth - Keep Cutting!</B>

<B>Economic Growth Through Tax Cuts and a Balanced Budget are
Truly at Stake</B></center>
<P><hr>
As President Clinton and Republican congressional leaders reconcile
their budget differences, it is important to reiterate your support
to your Senators and U.S. Representatives for a seven-year balanced
budget using Congressional Budget Office (CBO) numbers.  While
the president signed an agreement saying he supports a seven-year
balanced plan, already he is backing down from his word.
<P>
<B>ISSUE #1 - A Balanced Budget</B>
<P>
A balanced budget with tax cuts means we will keep more of what
we earn and spend it the way we see fit, rather than government
bureaucrats and politicians.  Will  a balanced budget translate
to a stronger U.S. economy where everyone wins?  Numerous economic
studies say yes.
<UL>
<LI>According to the Joint Economic Committee, a balanced budget
will lead to the creation of 6.1 million more jobs in 10 years,
and will boost real per-capita income 16.1%.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>A balanced budget means lower interest rates on home mortgages,
car loans, and student loans.  This, coupled with the tax credit,
could mean a &quot;balanced-budget bonus&quot; of up to $2800
a year for a family of four.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>According to a Heritage Foundation simulation, moving to a
balanced budget between 1996 and 2002 will result in the additional
construction of 104,000 homes and additional sales of 600,000
automobiles over the next seven years. <B>The simulation showed
an additional $32.1 billion in real disposable income through
2002.</B>
</UL>

<P>

<P>
It is obvious that a balanced budget within the next seven years
will have tremendous economic benefits for our economy and American
families.  But it is important that the president stick to the
seven-year agreement and use what he said were the most truthful
figures - CBO numbers.
<P>
MESSAGE TO CONGRESS: Pass a 7 Year Balanced Budget Using CBO Numbers
<P>
Capitol Hill Switchboard (202) 225-3121
<P>
<B>ISSUE #2 - Capital Gains Tax Cuts</B>
<P>
Despite class warfare rhetoric from congressional Democrats and
President Clinton, capital gains tax cuts will benefit all Americans,
not just the rich.  According to SBSC Chief Economist Ray Keating,
the Republican proposal for a 50% exclusion on capital gains income
is the most &quot;pro-growth&quot; step Congress can take this
year.  Firms will pay a top rate of 28%.
<UL>
<LI>A recent study by DRI/McGraw-Hill found that a top capital
gains tax rate of 25% coupled with indexation of cap-gains taxes
for inflation and retroactivity of the cuts to Jan. 1, 1995 would
reduce the cost of capital by 12% and increase the GDP by 1.7%
from 1996-2005.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>According to the Joint Economic Committee, 83.7% of the returns
claiming capital gains came from families with incomes less than
$100,000.  The remaining 16.3% of claims were from families with
incomes over $100,000.  The largest segment of the population
claiming cap-gains (56.9%) have incomes below $50,000 -- the so-called
&quot;rich.&quot;
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>According to Economist and SBSC Board Member Richard Rahn,
&quot;The capital gains tax is a direct levy on investment and
entrepreneurship...the lifeblood of a vibrant economy...the current,
non-indexed federal tax rate of 28 percent on cap-gains remains
a formidable obstacle to economic expansion...and small business
growth.&quot;
</UL>

<P>

<P>
President Clinton says he wants a capital gains  tax cut as long
as &quot;it creates jobs and promotes economic growth.&quot; 
The Republican proposal meets that criteria.
<P>
Please make your voice heard and support capital gains tax reduction.
<P>

<B>The Reconciliation Bill -- What Does it Mean for Small Business

<P><hr>

The House and Senate are finishing work on an enormous budget
package which includes many provisions helpful to small business
owners.  Though the budget plan doest not reduce spending and
taxes as much as SBSC had hoped, we believe the plan is a significant
and necessary step toward fiscal security.  This seven-year balanced
budget proposal faces an imminent veto upon reaching the President's
desk.  Despite strong support for the package within both chambers
of Congress, many lawmakers are feeling the heat from the special
interests.  <B>We encourage all interested small business owners
to contact their elected officials, including President Clinton,
and voice their support for a seven-year balanced budget.</B>
 Some of the pro-small business elements of the package are outlined
below.  Your representative or Senator may be reached at 202-225-3121.
<P>
<B>Capital Gains Tax Cuts -</B> The budget bill would cut taxes
on capital gains (profits from the sale of stock, property or
other assets) $35.7 billion.
<P>
The proposed maximum capital gains tax rate is 19.8% for individuals
and 28% for corporations.  The proposal would make these cuts
retroactive to January 1, 1995.
<P>
The indexation of capital gains to inflation will take effect
in 2001.  Both individuals and corporations would have reduced
capital gains tax rates for investment in qualified small business
stock.
<P>
SBSC feels these measures are a step in the right direction as
we fight for elimination of the highly regressive tax on capital
gains.
<P>
<B>Expensing</B> - The expensing amount would be raised for small
businesses.  The amount, currently $17,500, would be increased
gradually to $25,000 by 2002.
<P>
<B>Medical Savings Accounts</B> - Medical savings accounts (MSAs)
are included in the congressional plan.  Under the plan, individuals
would be allowed to make tax-deductible contributions to an MSA.
 Earnings would be tax free and distributions would also be tax-free.
 Maximum tax-favored contributions for individuals would be $2000,
for families the maximum would be $4000.
<P>
<B>Family Tax Relief</B> - The plan grants a $500 tax credit for
children under age 18 ($125 in 1995) for families earning less
than $110,000, reduces the marriage penalty, and allows for breaks
for those who adopt children or provide custodial care for the
elderly.
<P>
<B>Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs)</B> - The plan would
expand eligibility for traditional deductible IRAs, while also
creating a new IRA in which contributions would be taxable but
earnings would be tax-free.  Also, the plan allows for penalty-free
withdrawals from deductible IRAs.
<P>
<B>Estate and Gift Taxes</B> - An estate tax relief proposal was
included in the package.  The unified credit would be phased up
to $750,000 and a portion of small business assets would be excluded
from the estate tax.
<P>
<B>Self-Employed Health Insurance Deduction</B> - The bill would
raise the health insurance deduction of America's self-employed
to 50% by 2002.
<P>
While not perfect, the congressional package of tax cuts and debt
reduction is a fine way to approach fiscal security for America's
future generations.  The Small Business Survival Committee encourages
its members to congratulate Congress on a job well done and to
urge their representatives to stand by the proposal's tax-cutting,
spending reduction measures.

<title>Unleashing America's Potential -- Introduction -- TRC</title>

<h3>SETTING THE EAGLE FREE</h3><br>
<HR>

<P>
<B>INTRODUCTION</B>
</center><p><blockquote><blockquote>
<I>&quot;In short, it is a paradoxical truth
that tax rates are too high today and tax revenues are too low,
and the soundest way to raise the revenues in the long run is
to cut the rates now...The purpose of cutting taxes now is not
to incur a budget deficit, but to achieve the more prosperous,
expanding economy which can bring a budget surplus.&quot;</I>
<P>
John F. Kennedy<BR>
Economic Club of New York<BR>
December 14, 1962</blockquote>
<P>
These words of President Kennedy were a great inspiration to me as the tax reform movement was 
launched in the early 1980s with the Kemp/Roth tax cut.  Kennedy's vision and
courage can serve as examples for all Americans as we struggle
to make this nation better for our children and grandchildren.
 His remarks from the Economic Club of New York ring as true today
as they did in 1962. 
<p>
 At the first meeting of our commission back in June, I held up a blank sheet of paper and said, &quot;This
is what we start with.&quot;  That was our charge: Senate Majority
Leader Bob Dole and House Speaker Newt Gingrich appointed the
National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform to study
the current tax code, listen to the suggestions and ideas of people
from around the country, and submit to Congress our recommendations
for comprehensive reform.  
<P>
A very diverse and dedicated group of 14 people, with the help of an invaluable, overworked, and
underpaid staff, set out to design an entirely new tax system
for America's 21st century; one which would promise a booming
economy, promote job creation, and ensure the greatest possible
opportunity for all Americans to work, save, invest, and reach
their potential.  We operated under the premise that an economic
growth rate of 2.5% is unacceptable to the American people.
<p>
This commission was empowered not merely to offer superficial reforms,
to trim a rate here and close a loophole there, but to begin with
a <I>tabula rasa</I> and map out a totally new tax structure for
America's next century.  We also wanted to help inform the whole
world, particularly the emerging democracies, that the goal of
tax policy is raising revenue, not redistribution of wealth. 
<p>
Our nation has arrived at a unique moment in history.  With the
passing of the Cold War, we are standing at the edge of a new
millennium with extraordinary possibilities.  Our country is poised
to help lead the world into a new era of economic growth fueled
by an information-age technological revolution that can yield
unparalleled expansion in jobs, productivity, innovation, and
prosperity.  We must embrace this opportunity and challenge. 
However, such an embrace will prove difficult, perhaps impossible,
if we remain saddled with our current tax code.  The current system
is indefensible: it is riddled with special interest tax breaks,
and it overtaxes both labor and capital.  We must construct a
tax system that reflects our highest values and unleashes our
greatest potential.
<p>
  The comments and concerns we heard from the
American people over the last several months, coupled with a systematic
review of the current tax code, helped us establish certain principles
to guide us to our conclusions.  Surely, a tax code which is simple
and fair must generate sufficient revenue so that the federal
government may carry out its legitimate tasks.  Second, it must
not place a tax burden on those members of society least able
to bear one.  And, perhaps most important of all, it must not
restrict the innovative and entrepreneurial capacities of Americans
upon which rising living standards and our general prosperity
so greatly depend.  Our proposals are in keeping with these principles.
<p>
Wildly excessive and unjust taxes have locked away access to capital
and credit necessary for lower-income Americans to launch the
next generation of entrepreneurship.  Today, sadly, we see the
American people's sense of dynamism and hope, their ability to
strive and compete diminished by a tax code which penalizes success,
retards investment, and sends capital fleeing overseas.  The commission
is united in the belief that only a pro-growth tax code can restore
America's confidence at home and her greatness abroad.  We want
a tax code and an overall economy that will liberate the American
dream and remove the barriers to upward social and economic mobility.
 The American ethos of entrepreneurship and optimism made America
great once before.  We believe these proposals will bolster that
ethos again and help restore integrity and honesty to our system.
<p>
The author John Gardner has observed that there are many contributing
factors to the rise of civilization - accidents of resources,
geography, and military power.  But whatever other ingredients
comprise the greatness of nations, he writes, &quot;There occurs
at breathtaking moments in history an exhilarating burst of energy
and motivation, of hope and zest and imagination, and a severing
of the bonds that normally hold in check the full release of human
possibilities.  A door is opened, and the caged eagle soars.&quot;
 That eagle, the symbol of our nation, represents the creative
spirit, talents, and aspirations of the American people.  The
charge of this commission and the intent of our recommendations
is to open the door and help set that eagle in all of us free.

<p>Ive admired over the years the fine work that the Foundation has done, in terms of its college campus work... its support of student activities, these national conferences during the summer, and the many other things that they do to bring conservatives to campuses, providing an opportunity to balance the debate.  On most of our campuses you dont always have the opportunity to have conservative speakers as readily as people representing other points of view.  What the Foundation does to balance that out, even it up, is certainly a very important thing.</p>

It is one thing to back a speaker after he has gained recognition, but you helped me promulgate the ideas in Illiberal Education long before they were fashionable or in any sense hot.

<h2>Regional Confrence Galvanizes Activists</h2>
<h4>Over 400 Eager Students Hear North, Evans, Robinson</h4>

<img alt="Students.gif" src="students.gif">
<hr><i>Egar Texas students turn out in force for Young America's Foundation regional confrence in Dallas.  Over 400 students came to hear from <b>Ollie North, Michael Williams, Stan Evans, Ron Robinson, Senator Steve Symms, Floyd Brown</b> and others during the two-day event.</i>
<hr>

Taking its campus road trip to the heart of Texas, <b>Young America's Foundation</b> headed to Dallas for a conference with over 400 college students in attendance on February 17 and 18.<p>

<b>Colonel Oliver North</b> kicked off the event Friday night with a rousing speech to students about the future of the conservative movement. He said that while conservatives had a great victory in Novernber, they need to stay true to their principles and keep their word to the American people. He called the Contract with America "something unique in American political experience." This is the first time government has established a "set of parameters" on which to govern and by which individuslc will be judged. Colonel North encouraged his primarily student audience to get involved in public policy
and make a difference.<p>

<img alt="Ollie North" src="north.gif"><br>
<hr>
<i><b>Ollie North</b> joins students during the cofrence, urging them to be active on their campuses and to make a difference.</i><hr>

Saturday began with a lecture by former <b>Senator Steve Symms</b>, president of Freedom Alliance, on the ability of young people to have a voice in policy making. He cited his career in politics which began at
age 34, when as a virtual unknown in the political world, he ran for and won a seat in the United States
House of Representatives.<p>

<b>Michael Williams</b>, assistant secretary for civil rights for the Department of Education during the Bush Administration, followed with a lively discussion on political correctness and racial issues on campuses. He encouraged students to seek support in the black student community. He said, "You will put out your hand and they will slap it; that will happen again and again. But if you persist, you will reach them."<p>

<img alt="Michael Williams" src="mwill.gif"><hr>
<i><b>Michael Williams</b> talks with a student following his remarks on political correctness and racial issues on campus.</i><hr>

Foundation President <b>Ron Robinson</b> and Director of Program Development <b>Kate Obenshain Griffin</b> talked to students about the urgency and opportunities of campus activism, saying now that conservatives have taken over Congress, liberals are turning their attention to the campuses and the next generation with renewed vigor. In order to challenge their leftist professors, Mr. Robinson urged students to take the initiative in educating themselves about conservative ideals by reading conservative journals and books. He told student activists to surround themselves with supportive people who would work with them in promoting conservatism on campus. And he encouraged students to "be enthusiastic about your ideas and convictions. Only then will you capture the interest and imagination of your fellow students whom you are trying to reach."<p>

Mr. Robinson warned students to remember as they seek to reach other students that a perfect audience is never assembled and that they need to reach out to a broad audience. And finally, citing the examples of <b>William Buckley</b> and <b>Rush Limbaugh</b>, Mr. Robinson told students, "Start your own organization if your conservative voice is not being heard through existing ones." Instead of working for the <i>New Yorker</i> magazine and the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>, Mr. Buckley started up his own publication, <i>National Review</i>. Similarly, instead of working his way up with ABC and CBS news Limbaugh started his own radio show.<p>

Following an introduction by Foundation board member and Texas native <b>Wayne Thorburn</b>, <b>M. Stanton Evans</b> delivered the luncheon address, discussing his book, <b>The Theme Is Freedom</b>. He chroIlicled and corrected the fallacies of the liberal history lesson students are taught regarding the development of our nation and the roots of the freedom we enjoy.<p>

<b>Floyd Brown</b>, president of Citizens United, spoke on the Clinton presidency, detailing the Whitewater controversy and providing insights on the Mexican bailout. He chided Mr. Clinton for misleading the American people and disgracing the office of the president.<p>

<b>Tom Pauken</b>, chairman of the Texas Republican Party, closed the conference discussine the continuation of the Reagan Revolution. He also talked about his book <b>The Thirty Years War</b>.<p>

<img alt="Michelle Sharp" src="sharp.gif"><hr>
<i><b>Michelle Sharp,</b> Young America's Foundation's program officer for lectures, speaks to students about bringing prominent conservative speakers to their campuses.</i><hr>

University of Dallas student and Young America's Foundation activist <b>Tom Lagarde</b> said, "We need more events like this one. Conservative students from across the region have the chance to get together with one another and find out how students are coping with different situations. And we get to hear from more great conservative speakers in one day than most would hear from in four years at school."<p>

Each year, Young America's Foundation hosts regional student conferences in several states around the country.<p><p>

<title>"Intellectual Scandal" Uncovered By Evans</title>

<h2>"Intellectual Scandal" Uncovered By Evans</h2>
<h4>Salvatori Speaker Urges Understanding of Our Founding</h4>

Before a packed house of 400 college students from across the country, <b>M. Stanton Evans</b> urged students to remember the religious roots of our liberty as understood by America's Founding Fathers. The student event was sponsored by Young America's Foundation and the Fund for American Studies at  the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington, D.C on February 18. Mr. Evans is the Henry  Salvatori Distinguished Lecturer for 1994-1995, and will be sponsored by Young America's Foundation to  speak before twelve college audiences during the current academic year.<p>

Refuting what he calls "the liberal history lesson, " Mr. Evans said his latest book, <b>The Theme is Freedom</b>, deals with the origins of freedom in the United States and the role faith and religion played in establishing that freedom.<p>

<img alt="Mr. Evans" src="evans1.gif"><hr>
<i>Mr. Evans signs his book, <b>The Theme is Freedom</b>, for students following his speech.</i>
<hr>

Specifically, he dealt with three interrelated issues: first, where our freedom comes from; second, why we have freedom in America; and finally, how we sustain freedom.<p>

The issue of the role of faith in our founding has implications for modern political dilemmas such as prayer in school, abortion, and the so-called Religious Right.<p>

Liberals argue that faith and freedom are in conflict and that if we want freedom, we must keep religion out  of the public sphere. That line of reasoning, Mr. Evans said, is the premise for recent court decisions  banning prayer in school and forbidding any form of religious observance from public settings.<p>

According to Mr. Evans, such rulings, as well as the theory that faith and freedom are at odds, "are products of the way we are taught political and intellectual history-that is, through what I call the liberal 
history lesson."<p>

The liberal history lesson posits that freedom, philosophy, drama and other worthy practices existed in the ancient world, prior to Christianity. Mr. Evans said we are taught that in the early 5th century, the fall of classical antiquity "was followed by 1000 years of nothingness.... The Christian church ruled in an era of oppression and dictatorship."<p>

During the Renaissance, the liberals teach, classical antiquity was rediscovered, the institution of the 
church was rejected and there emerged what became the modern era's secular, rational basis for democracy,  freedom and the nation-state. Our Constitution, and the resulting rationalistic free system, is a product of the Enlightenment, according to the Left.<p>

"This is the framework," said Mr. Evans, "in which most of us, for decades, have learned our intellectual history." American history is being taught, for the most part, as a "subset" of the larger world history lesson.<p>

That lesson, according to Mr. Evans, is a "complete misstatement of the facts and of the record. It is an effort to impose secular liberal concepts on our system."<p>

There is no validity to the argument that faith and freedom are in conflict, and in reality, "They must go together, both conceptually and as a matter of history."<p>

Conceptually, Mr. Evans said, liberals argue that relativism, or the belief that there are no absolute standards, is necessary for a tolerant and just society-that a society can only be free when judgment is suspended. If that were the case, according to Mr. Evans, and there were no moral absolutes, no right or wrong, then a society could not pass judgment on Adolph Hitler. "How does one condemn any atrocity?" he asked. "All totalitarian regimes were relativist."<p>

<img alt="Mr. Evans" src="evans.gif"><hr>
<i>As part of the Henry Salvatori Distinguished Lecture Series, <b>M. Stanton Evans</b> speaks during a student luncheon, hosted by Young America's Foundation, at the Conservative Political Action Confrence.  Mr. Evans said the modern interpretation that prayer has no place in the public sphere is a travesty.  "it is an intellectual scandal and it's unconstitutional."</i><hr>

Faith and freedom must go together according to historical fact as well. In the Declaration of Independence, for instance, Thomas Jefferson wrote that it is  "self evident" that human beings are created equal. But Mr. Evans said, "If it was so evident to Jefferson, and to us, why wasn't it self evident to Aristotle, arguably the smartest man who ever lived? " Aristotle believed that some are born to be slaves and that all citizens belong to the state.<p>

According to Mr. Evans, the notion of limits on governmental power that stems from the Bible did not exist in Aristotle's time. Our Founding Fathers derived the notion that people should seek freedom rather than the bondage of a king from the Book of Samuel.<p>

Mr. Evans notes that both the Magna Carta and the Mayflower Compact are religious documents which were fundamental in the formation of our free form of government. Revisionists often say that the pilgrims who wrote the Mayflower Compact in 1620 found their inspiration for the document in John Lockerather than the Bible. Locke, however, was not born until 1632. The document is based purely on covenental theology, and subsequently, had a major impact on all of our governmental institutions with which we are familiar today.<p>

The First Amendment, Mr. Evans said, has suffered most grossly the inaccuracies of liberal revisionism. Modern history lessons, and in turn, the Supreme Court, now declare that the First Amendment was intended "to banish relizion from the public order."

According to Mr. Evans, that notion is "Orwellian and a complete inversion and falsification of our history."<p>

At the time the First Amendment was written, states established churches and even imposed religious requirements for holding pub- | lic office. We are told that Congress adopted the First Amendment in order to prohibit tax-supported prayer. Yet on September 25, 1789, one day after Congress passed the First Amendment, it passed a resolution calling on the president to declare a day of prayer and thanksgiving, which President Washington did.<p>

The modern interpretation of the Constitution, which states that prayer has no place in the public sphere, is a "travesty," according to Mr. Evans. "It is an intellectual scandal and it's unconstitutional."<p>

Mr. Evans said it is up to conservatives to recover the true history of our nation. While liberals have embraced revisionist history, conservatives must "get the basics right about the principles from which our freedoms developed."<p>

As part of the Henry Salvatori Distinguished Lecture Series, Mr. Evans' campus appearances have included, among others, <b>Canisius College</b> in New York on February 23, <b>Regent College</b> in Virginia on March 23, <b>Fordham University</b> in New York on April 5, and <b>Princeton University</b> on April 18.<p><p>

<h2>On the Home Front</h2>

<img src="cartoon.gif"><hr>
<i>In February, Young America's Foundation President <b>Ron Robinson</b> called on Rutgers University President <b>Francis Lawrence</b> to resign.  After enacting a speech code which threatened students with expulsion or suspension if they made a statement likely "to cause annoymance ... even if communicative in nature," Mr. Lawrence violated it.  Students were outraged when he stated that minorities don't "have the genetic, hereditary background to have a higher [SAT] average."  While Young America's Foundation is unalterably opposed to speech codes designed to restrict the free flow of ideas, Mr. Robinson said that college administrators who impose these regulations should abide by them.</i><hr>

<h4>Novak To Be Flowers Lecturer</h4>

Young America's Foundation is pleased to announce that <b>Robert Novak</b> will be the featured speaker for the <b>1995 William H. Flowers, Jr. Lecture Series</b>.

<h4>Short, Griffen, Rosenberger Return To Foundation</h4>

<b>Marc Short</b> returned to Young America's Foundation as national director after serving as <b>Oliver North's</b> director of the Virginia Finance Committee during Northis senatorial campaign. Marc originally joined the Foundation as national director after graduating from Washington and Lee University in 1992.<p>

<b>Kate Obenshain Griffin</b> concluded her tenure as Governor George Allen's special assistant for policy development and returned to the Foundation as director of program development. In 1991, after graduating from the University of Virginia, Kate became the Foundation's lecture director.<p>

In the midst of his high-profile Supreme Court case against the University of Virginia, <b>Ron Rosenberger</b>joins the Foundation as a program officer. Ron served as an intern at the Foundation while a student at the University of Virginia. As a campus activist at Wa, Ron founded <i>Wide Awake</i>, a publication which was denied student activities funds on the basis of it being a "religious activity." Ron filed suit agains UVa and his case is currently before the Supreme Court.<p>

<title>Campus Crisis</title>
</head>

<body background="/yaf/ground2.gif">

<h2>Campus Crisis</h2>

<h4>Deceiving Donors</h4>

Having misled alumnus <b>Lee M. Bass</b> on its plans to develop a program on Western Civilization, Yale University has agreed to return Mr. Bass' $20 million gift to the school. While the program was scheduled to begin in the fall of 1993, it was not until the spring of 1995 that Yale informed Mr. Bass that they were prepared to go ahead with the program. In the intervening years, however, Yale had scrapped the original implementation plan for the Western Civ program and appointed a new advisory committee to develop a scheme more acceptable to leftist critics. This shift occurred unbeknownst to Mr. Bass, who had been assured by Yale President <b>Richard Levin</b> that he would be kept abreast of the program's development. A skeptical Mr. Bass, aware of Yale's move toward a more multicultural approach to teaching history, asked to approve the professors scheduled to teach the course. Yale refused and has agreed to return the gift. Student <b>Pat Collins</b> said, "I'm disappointed that the university wasn't able to conduct itself in a  trustworthy way to allay the concerns of the donor."<p>

<h4>PC Strikes Again</h4>

Ironically, one week before the Supreme Court was set to hear the case of <i>Wide Awake</i>, a University of Virginia publication denied funding due to its Christian perspective, UVa struck again. This time the Student Council defunded the conservative student magazine, the <i>Virginia Advocate</i>. According to Student Council, the <i>Advocate</i> represented a "political activity." Student Council appropriates funds to leftist political organizations such as the National Organization for Women, Gay and Straight for Equality, and the Lesbian, Bisexual and Gay Student Union. UVa also funds decidedly liberal student newspapers such as the <i>University Journal</i> the <i>Declaration and Pride</i>. Student editors of the Virginia Advocate are appealing the decision to defund the paper and plan to take their case to court if necessary.<p>

<h4>Objections Raised To Communist Chair</h4>

<b>Angela Davis</b>, tenured professor of the history of consciousness at the University of California at Santa Cruz, has been named to the prestigious Presidential Chair by Jack W. Peltason, president of the university system. Her appointment has raised objections by California state senators who are concerned about Ms. Davis' "reputation for racism, violence and Communism."  As chair, Ms. Davis will have an additional $30,000 a year at her disposal, which she plans to use to develop an ethnic studies program.<p>

<h4>Strange Course Requirements</h4>

At Virginia's Tidewater Community College students taking a course in human sexuality have the option of reading five books other than their textbook or they may undertake one of the following: watch an X-rated movie, visit an adult bookstore, go to a gay bar, visit a family-planning center or an STD clinic, or speak to a member of the clergy concerning the church's philosophy regarding sexuality issues.  When a student objected to the activities the course was encouraging, the state's associate director of the State Council for Higher Education said the course sounded "perfectly legitimate" and said, "I can't imagine any student has the right to complain."<p><p>

<h2>Conservative Black Speakers Hit the Campus</h2>

<h4>Foundation Program Countering Black Racist Speakers on Campus</h4>

In response to the overwhelmingly leftist bent of Black History Month on campuses, Young America's 
Foundation initiated the Alternative Black Speakers Program. The program enables Young America's Foundation to send conservative black speakers to college campuses across the country, giving students an alternative to the often radical and irresponsible message of black lecturers appearing on campuses as part of official university programs.<p>

Young America's Foundation is offering the Alternative Black Speakers Program to students who are 
disappointed in the liberal, divisive message being promoted by their schools during Black History Month. Radicals such as <b>Joycelyn Elders</b>, former surgeon general under <b>President Clinton</b>, who recently stated that students should be taught about masturbation at an early age, and <b>Anita Hill</b> are frequent speakers on college campuses. Rap musician, <b>Ice T</b>, who sings about killing police, brought his message to Radford University in Virginia. During a lecture at West Chester University in Pennsylvania, <b>Khalid Muhammad</b> told students, "Now is the time to stand up and fight back.... There are no good crackers [white people], and if you find one, kill him before he changes. " At the University of Pennsylvania, <b>Louis Farrakhan</b> accused Jews of -"using God as a shield for [their] dirty religion.<p>

<img alt="William Allen" src="allen.gif"><hr>
<i><b>William Allen</b> talks candidly with students at Young America's Foundation's 1994 Summer Confrence.</i><hr>

<b>Stokely Carmichael</b> called for a complete revolution during a speech at the University of California at Irvine. He urged African Americans to overthrow the American capitalist society. Mr. Carmichael said, "No human advances are possible without the shedding of blood.... Student movements must have a strong wational base," he said. "They must be clear and precise. One must be willing to kill and die for it."<p>

The Foundation's experience with the Alternative Black Speakers Program has shown that there is great demand for conservative black speakers, and, while the project is entering its second year, that demand continues unabated. Young America's Foundation receives calls daily requesting information on this program.<p>

Young America's Foundation has sponsored twentyfour speeches by black conservative :-speakers. Speakers include <b>Walter Williams</b>, an economics professor at George Mason University, who speaks on free market issues; <b>Star Parker</b>, a former welfare recipient who broke free of dependency and became highly successful in business; and <b>Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas</b>, who will speak at two schools in the fall.<p>

<img alt="Star Parker" src="parker.gif"><hr>
<i><b>Star Parker</b> talks with a student at Florida State University following her remarks during Black History Month.</i><hr>

Young America's Foundation's Alternative Black Speakers Program has provided thousands of students with an opportunity to hear conservative speakers during Black History Month and throughout the year. Star Parker's appearance at Swarthmore College in December was highly successful. and
students were able to obtain cosponsorship with the "Women of Color" organization on their campus. During the speech, Ms. Parker said, "Capitalism is opportunity, it gives people vision, structure,
absolutes and order.... The American dream does not involve socialism, it involves capitalism." She 
explored the pitfalls and disincentives of the welfare state, saying, "Where else can you go that you get 
$500 a month for getting pregnant? "<p>

Florida State University conservative student activists also hosted Ms. Parker during Black History
Month. Young America's Foundation activist and FSU student, <b>Stephen Slivinski</b> said, "Star Parker was bright and articulate -- a glittering personality. She spoke with the conviction and compassion that liberals claim conservatives don't have. The audience was diverse in ideology as well as race-something that would make the affirmative action proponents proud, save for the fact that the audience showed up to be enlightened and challenged, not by dint of some governmental program."<p>

Walter Williams spoke to 650  students at Texas A&~~M University during the College Republican "Rush Week." He addressed the role of government in a free society, saying, "Expanding government is not the answer; the free market should determine where the dollars go." His address was featured an the front page of the school newspaper.<p>

Over 350 students turned out at the University of Arkansas to hear Dr. Williams, who said that the nation is headed toward more totalitarianism and governmental control. Our problems as a nation, according to Dr. Williams, are caused by "a significant departure from the principles of individual freedom that made us a rich nation to begin with Dr. Williams said that this diagnosis could carry us part of the way toward solving our national problems. "One good thing about Americans is that they never do the wrong thing for a long time." He said he is expecting the American people to change their present economic course.
At what students called the best attended lecture in years, over 400 students at Penn State University heard Dr. Williams speak. He has also spoken at Iowa State University and the University of 
Wisconsin - Milwaukee.<p>

Through the Alternative Black Speakers Program, Young America's Foundation has identified dynamic black speakers who are eager to bring a conservative message to the campuses for years to come. While 
colleges and universities instinctively bring liberal speakers to their school, Young America's Foundation is 
working daily with students to offer an alternative, conservative message from black speakers.<p><p>

<h3>Rebirth, Return, Reunion:  Hungary's Euro-Atlantic Agenda</h3>

By <b>His Excellency Arpd Gncz</b><br>
President of the Republic of Hungary<br>
October 26, 1995<br>
<P>
It is a great pleasure and honor for me to be able to brief you, an audience of one of the most prestigious policy think tanks of the United States, on the principal foreign policy endeavors of Hungary. In your full-fledged democracy, the activity of research institutes devoid of the burden of day-to-day politics but dedicated to the thorough analysis of long-term processes and historical causality plays an important role beside the protagonists of politics. When it comes to shaping U.S. foreign policy, people at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue no doubt pay heed to the work of <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a> as well as the opinion of its researchers. I, therefore, address you now not only as researchers and people interested in the subject, but also as persons who have influence, to a lesser or greater extent, on the United States' foreign policy towards the Central European region, including Hungary, and thus on the success of Hungary's foreign policy objectives.
<p>
<b>Rebirth</b>
<p>
For well over 40 years Hungary, similarly to other Central European states, lived torn from the bosom of her natural European environment. In the wake of the imposition of Soviet rule, the Iron Curtain that fell across the center of Europe and along Hungary's western border hermetically isolated Central and Eastern Europe from the western part of the continent. The countries under Soviet rule were forcibly subjected to the inhumane and unnatural experiment of building communism. While east of the Iron Curtain the world witnessed the continuous destruction of human, moral, and material values, the United States and Western Europe registered never-before-seen democratic and economic progress, thus bringing about the cooperation of the community of prosperous democracies.
<p>
The non-viable Soviet regime eventually collapsed under its own weight, due in no small measure to the fact that it was simply unable to keep pace with the rate of development and the arms race dictated by the United States. It is clear today that the staunch anti-communist stance of President Reagan, accused of reviving the Cold War chill, in no way slowed the agony of the communist system; on the contrary, it reduced its duration considerably. In 1989 the zombie states of Central Europe came around from 40 years of inertia and set about building, on the ruins of communism, an open and democratic society working on the principles of a market economy. The undertaking has turned out to be a lot harder than was expected, in either East or West. The countries of the Central European region have had to come to grips with a gamut of difficulties posed by the simultaneous change of the whole political and economic system. This constitutes an unparalleled historical challenge for the region and, I daresay, the whole of the Euro-Atlantic zone as well.
<p>
The complexity of the tasks surfacing with the transformation is well illustrated by the example of Hungary. Democracy and the idea of an economy based on private property and healthy competition came as no novelty to Hungary. Perchance not all of you know that the basic principles of democracy and the thought of freedom had touched Hungary way back in the mid-19th century. Although the war of independence waged against Habsburg absolutism was lost in 1849, its ideals lived on and materialized to a large extent in the wake of the Austro-Hungarian compromise of 1867. Lajos Kossuth, leader and symbol of the Hungarians' freedom fight, is remembered to this very day as the champion of liberty not only in Hungary, but also in the United States, where his bust stands in the Capitol. It is also worth recalling that Hungary, albeit only as part of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, formed an integral part of the economy and culture of Europe at the turn of the century, and her legal system met the requirements of the age.
<p>
All the above-mentioned traditions notwithstanding, the transformation following the events of 1989 has been an extremely painful process, particularly from the point of view of the economy. Nothing characterizes better the enormity of the undertaking than the fact that transforming the structure of the economy has called for exceptional efforts even from Hungary, a country that was the first and only state in the communist bloc to introduce gradual market reforms from 1968 onwards.
<p>
The fundamental institutions of democracy -- a multi-party system, free parliamentary elections, accountable government, independent courts, and the freedom of information -- had all been created by the end of 1990. Adapting to a market economy, however, entailed negative phenomena with repercussions to date, such as galloping inflation and unemployment, the waning of whole branches of industry, and the bankruptcy of state enterprises. Although these phenomena are obviously understandable for an economist, they provoke discontent among the people. The change of structure has, nevertheless, been completed by now, and today the economy is governed by market mechanisms. The private sector now accounts for some 60 percent of production. In 1994 the economy began to register a slight growth. Over 70 percent of Hungary's foreign trade is carried on with industrially developed countries. Besides, the influx of foreign capital into Hungary in the last six years has amounted to some 9 billion U.S. dollars, more than in any other country of the region. I am pleased to see that U.S. companies lead the way in the field of investment in Hungary with an approximately 40 percent share. Such favorable changes, together with strict financial stabilization measures, are creating the bases of long-term development.
<p>
In addition to the radical transformation of home affairs and the economy, Hungarian foreign policy has also undergone change. Hungary has turned towards the West again and is determined to return to the community of Western democracies. With the experience of the past well heeded, this time the overtures towards the West do not imply burning the bridges towards the East. Hungary has a vested interest in maintaining good relations with all the countries of the region. This intention, as well as our effort directed at our Euro-Atlantic integration, enjoys the backing of all the parliamentary parties and public opinion.
<p>

<b>Return</b>
<p>
Hungary thus has irreversibly launched a program to try to catch up with the developed world politically and economically, and hopes to be able to join as soon as possible the Euro-Atlantic integrational organizations, primarily NATO and the European Union. Our integration would not be complete without our membership in the OECD and the defense organization of the European Union, the Western European Union.
<p>
Our Euro-Atlantic integration is a means to an end and a symbol at the same time. It is a means to an end because, we firmly believe, securing lasting stability and prosperity hinges on Hungary becoming a member of NATO and the European Union. Twentieth century history has proved without the shadow of a doubt that the Central European region must not be abandoned or left to wither into a grey zone. Both world wars broke out partly as a direct consequence of expansionist powers regarding Central Europe as spoils of war. We are justified in stating that Hungary and her neighbors, with the exception of some tragic states of the former Yugoslavia, have to face no external threat at the moment; therefore, her Western integration is not a matter of life and death right now. Yet it is precisely the bitter experience of the past that urges both Hungary and her neighbors to preempt even the shaping of potential crises and drop anchor firmly in the community of Western democracies. Integration is a symbol too, as it indicates as clear as daylight that Hungary, a country that holds values and pursues objectives identical with those of the Western democracies, has the right to seek her due place in the Euro-Atlantic community.
<p>
It is in the sphere of the economy that the European Union could best promote the stability of the region and Hungary. On the one hand, it is a well-known fact that economic growth and the resulting prosperity considerably reduce animosity between different countries. On the other hand, the common market system of the Union is what could make Hungary's market, small just by itself, and production capacity really viable. The integration accomplished within the European Union is at the same time the symbol of reconciliation and cooperation in Europe. Although not primarily a defense organization, the Union provides, nonetheless, some form of guarantee against both outside aggression and conflicts between member states. Integration results in a kind of mutual dependence that excludes the possibility of inner hostility while shaping a bloc that, by its mere size, may serve as a deterrent. In the wake of the change of regime, Hungary did not delay in widening and institutionalizing her ties with the European Union, and is by now linked to the organization through an association agreement. Parallel to this, domestic processes have been launched in the fields of economic policy and law harmonization, which are prerequisites of admission to the Union. Hungary made an official announcement of her intention to join in the spring of 1994 and hopes to become a full-fledged member of the Union by the end of the millennium. Allow me to focus from this point forward on NATO above all else, since it is in this organization that your country plays the leading role.
<p>
In the course of the Cold War, NATO proved that it could deter any potential outside aggression and that its members could rely on the organization's "hard" security guarantees. The engine of the alliance's success was the United States, whose brave leaders of vision realized that the security of America and the security of Europe are inseparable, and that it is worth making sacrifices in the interest of common security. Beside the actual military defense and the U.S. nuclear shield, we must not fail to remark the alliance's good influence on relations between the members, in particular on relations between France and Germany.
<p>
Although the Cold War has ended and the Soviet Union has fallen apart, history has not come to an end, as Francis Fukuyama predicted a few years ago. On the contrary, the war in the Balkans and the conflicts raging in the former Soviet republics have shown that new and less predictable dangers encroach on the peace of the Euro-Atlantic region. The circumstances may have changed, and the tasks ahead may be different, yet NATO and an active United States presence in Europe are still needed as much as ever. Hungary, having taken the initiative to dissolve the Warsaw Pact, came to the early recognition that in order to ensure her long-term security she would have to become a member of the Union and join NATO. One cannot emphasize enough that Hungary's hope of becoming a member of the alliance is in no way directed against others. In other words, Hungary would not wish to use her eventual membership to the detriment of her neighbors in the region. On the contrary, it is in our interest that other Central European countries also be able to meet the requirements set for joining and be admitted to the organization, since security can be envisaged only in a wider context. Just to give you an example, the security of Romania and Slovakia, for instance, has a strong bearing on the development and security of Hungary, and vice versa.
<p>
Speaking of Hungary's intention to join the Euro-Atlantic integration, and the future of the Central European region, the question arises:  What interest does NATO, and particularly the United States, have in expanding the organization and, thus, covering the subsequent defense expenditure?  Among the numerous reasons, allow me to mention the most significant ones.
<p>
Guaranteeing human and minority rights and ensuring conditions for a free-market economy and democracy rank among the foreign policy priorities of the United States. In order for these values to prevail without any risks in Central Europe, not only today but in the future, the stability of the region must be increased, for which the expansion of NATO presents itself as the most convenient means. In the course of the Cold War, the world would have been swept to the verge of a catastrophe in the form of another world war had the United States endeavored to insist on the prevalence, even beyond the Iron Curtain, of the values she held dear. Today American values could spread and American interests could be guaranteed without a single gunshot and without any risk of a world war.
<p>
The United States has a vested trade interest in the stability and smooth economic development of the region, seeing that this region is becoming an increasingly significant market for U.S. products and investment. Expanding NATO may constitute a lasting means of securing this market. By the same token, the mere fact of NATO membership may exert a stimulating influence on investors, ever fearful of political risks.
<P>
We are positive that Hungary's NATO membership would benefit the security structure of the organization and, indirectly, the whole region and even the whole continent, in the geopolitical sense, as:
<p><ul>
<li>It would contribute to increasing stability in the Central European region;
<p>
It would ensure NATO an access route to the Balkans, which, despite the peace process currently under way, can be expected to continue as a region of instability in the future; and
<p>
<li>The Hungarian Army would contribute, albeit only to a modest degree, to the many-sided development of the alliance's military strength and even more favorable positions.
<p>
<li>NATO membership is a foreign policy goal based on substantial social consensus in virtually all the countries of the region. The expansion of NATO would, therefore, have a favorable effect on the faith our societies have in Western values, would increase their sense of security, and would prevent the eventual upsurge of frustration, which could well emerge should the extension be prolonged for too long.
</ul><p>


<b>Reunion</b>
<p>
Now that we have reviewed what motivates Hungary to approach NATO and what interest NATO has in extension, it is worth summing up briefly what we have actually done with a view to joining.
<p>
The fact that the Atlantic alliance has recognized the need for eastward extension and has launched the preparatory process for the admission of new members is an encouraging sign for us. We particularly welcome the initiatives in this issue of U.S. politicians, both in the Administration and in Congress. We regard the Partnership for Peace initiative, outlined in the fall of 1993 and launched in 1994, as an integral part of the road leading to membership. Not forgetting her size and possibilities, Hungary for her part endeavors to make the most of the opportunities offered by Partnership for Peace by taking part in the different operations and training programs. I was thrilled to hear that the Hungarian units taking part in Operation Cooperative Nugget, held in Louisiana this summer, stood their ground excellently. The mere fact of a joint operation tells a tale in itself. Just think it over. No more than six years ago, we would have laughed at the idea of the units of a small member state of the Warsaw Pact joining American and other allied troops for a military operation somewhere along the Mississippi.
<p>
Beyond Partnership for Peace, other forms of excellent cooperation now characterize relations between Hungary and NATO and NATO member states. For Hungary it was a great honor that the North Atlantic Assembly, NATO's parliamentary organ, held its May 1995 conference in Budapest, since it was the very first time it had held its session in a non-member state. The fact that NATO intelligence aircraft, the famous AWACS, carry on their activity in Hungarian air space in connection with the crisis in the Balkans provides promising bases for our future institutional cooperation. The joint U.S.-Hungarian military rescue operation held recently in Hungary was also a success. Military and technical compatibility, cited as a precondition for admission, is considerably improved by the Hungarian Army's increasing number of defense arms purchases from American companies.
<p>
We are fully aware that in today's world, security transcends the military aspect and embraces political, economic, social, and even cultural areas. Hungary does her utmost in order to ensure that her own peace and that of the region rest on stable foundations. Joining NATO as soon as possible serves our interest, but only as part of a complex process that aims, in the final analysis, at increasing the stability of the whole Euro-Atlantic region.
<p>
Keeping this objective in mind, Hungary pays particular attention to the most all-around possible strengthening of relations with her neighbors. Hungary looks upon the Hungarian minorities living in the neighboring countries as the cement of bilateral relations and not as a source of conflict. I must emphasize at this point that relations between Hungary and neighboring Austria, Slovenia, Croatia, and Ukraine are virtually problem-free. This spring we were able to sign a basic treaty with Slovakia with a view to accomplishing comprehensive progress in our relations and regulating the situation of the minorities. The agreement has already been ratified by the Hungarian Parliament, and we hope the Slovakian legislature will soon follow suit. We have conducted negotiations with Romania for nearly a year in order to draft a similar document, but unfortunately no breakthrough has yet come during the talks. I wish to stress that signing a basic treaty, while important, is not the sole element of relations between Hungary and Romania. We strive to deepen bilateral relations in all areas regardless of whether there is or is not a basic treaty. What gives us hope for the future is that economic, trade, and military ties are developing well between Hungary and Romania. All the aforesaid goes to show that Hungary has no problem with any of her neighbors that could even remotely hold the threat of a "second Bosnia," as is occasionally alleged by some who oppose the extension of NATO.
<p>
In connection with a more comprehensive interpretation of security, I wish to mention the pivotal role of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. The OSCE, among whose members the United States plays an active part, is the only Euro-Atlantic institution with wide-ranging security competence. Hungary, in her role as Chairman- in-Office, has recognized the OSCE's unique opportunities in the field of confidence building, crisis prevention, and management, and strives to make the most of them.
<p>
In 1995, under Hungary's chairmanship, the organization opened a mission in Grozny, the capital of Chechnya, and appointed three ombudsmen responsible for human rights, thus considerably enhancing the activity of the Sarajevo mission. Another mission, soon to be inaugurated in Croatia, is also to serve the comprehensive settlement of the conflict in the Balkans. These missions everywhere spare no effort to reach a peaceful settlement in the conflicts. In Chechnya this led to the signing of an agreement between the warring parties on July 30. If the guns in the Balkans are silenced for good, the OSCE is ready to undertake an increasingly active role in consolidating peace and the process of rehabilitation following the conflict. In the same manner, the OSCE provides an institutional framework for Russia to discuss Euro-Atlantic security issues. This function of the organization is expected to gain more impetus as NATO expansion materializes.
<p>
<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>
After the fall of the Berlin Wall, Hungary did not delay in setting off on the road to Euro-Atlantic integration, and she is now doing her utmost, both in the area of preparing the country and in her foreign policy, to become a full-fledged member of NATO and the EU as soon as possible. The fact that Western democracies and integrational organizations have recognized the importance of the chance to open towards the East and are willing to cooperate with the fledgling democracies of Central Europe is a source of encouragement for us. And yet, opinions are voiced over and over again criticizing the too speedy reintegration of Hungary and her neighbors in the region and questioning the justification for NATO extension. Such opinions are fearful of accepting new responsibilities and the consolidation, not to mention the possible defense, of the Central European democracies. Any delay or uncertainty may eventually exact a high price, since there is no excluding the possibility of the situation in these fledging democracies growing critically worse due either to their own internal problems or to any unfavorable developments in the region east of them.
<p>
Our common task and responsibility is, therefore, possibly even greater than it was in 1989, when the picture was rather more simple. All the hard work of recent times may have been in vain unless Hungary and her neighbors in the region are able to drop anchor as soon as possible, and for good, in the safety of the developed democracies' haven. In conclusion, permit me to quote the great statesman, President John F. Kennedy:  "The United States will pay any price, bear any burden in defense of freedom around the world.... "<sup>1</sup> If President Kennedy's message still holds good, bearing a not-too-big burden today, for the same purpose and right on the finishing line, cannot constitute a matter for discussion. The burden must be borne.

<h3>Homer, Shakespeare, and Tolstoy: What Literature Teaches About the Collapse and Recovery of Home and Family</h3>
<p>
By <b>David Patterson</b><br>
Associate Professor of European Literature, Oklahoma State University
<p>
The second <a href="/heritage/kirk/kirklect.html">Russell Kirk Memorial Lecture</a>, October 19, 1995.
<P>
In a Heritage Foundation lecture titled "The Fraud of Multiculturalism," <a href="/heritage/kirk/kirkmem.html">Russell Kirk</a> noted that "cultural restoration, like charity, begins at home."  And he was quite right. For cultural restoration entails the restoration of what is most high, most dear, most enduring. And the ground for all such things is the home. The home is the place where our names are first uttered with love and therefore where we first discover that we mean something. It is the site where both human beings and human values first make their appearance in the world. It is the center from which we define and understand the nature of everything we encounter in the world. The home, then, is not one thing among many in a world of things; nor is it merely the product of a culture. Rather, the world of things derives its sense, and a culture its significance, from their relationship to the home. Without the home, everything else in the world or in a culture is meaningless.
<P>
Just as the home is not one thing among many, the human relationship from which it arises is not one among many. I am speaking, of course, of marriage, or, more properly, of holy matrimony. The sanctity of the home is rooted in the sanctity of marriage. And the holiness of human life is rooted in the holiness of this union through which life is born into the world. Indeed, from ancient times marriage has been a metaphor for the expression of the relation between the human and the holy. In the Christian tradition, for example, the Church is called "the Bride of Christ."  And according to the Jewish tradition, the two tablets given to Moses at Sinai signify a bride and groom, indicating that Israel is betrothed to God as a wife is betrothed to her husband. Marriage alone makes it possible to overcome a fundamental condition of exile and thus dwell in the world. Why?  Because in the union of holy matrimony the seed of the home is planted. That seed comes to life when a wife becomes a mother and a husband becomes a father; it comes into being upon the birth of a child, when the family comes into being. The home, then, might be better understood not as a place or a thing, but as an event in the life of the holy.
<p>
Viewed as such an event, the emergence of the family that constitutes the home is far more than just a biological phenomenon or even a natural wonder. A mother, for example, is not just one who gives birth, but one who emanates light, love, and compassion. Through her humanity receives a revelation of the light created upon the first utterance of Creation, the light that sanctifies all Creation. Indeed, only through the wife and mother of a household does blessing fall upon a home; for as the bearer of life she is most intimately aligned with the miracle and mystery of life. Indeed, she and the Creator of life at times share the same name. In Hebrew, for instance, the Creator is sometimes referred to as <i>Ha-Rachamim</i>, or "the Compassionate One," a term that has the same root as the word <i>rechem</i>, which means "womb." 
<p>
Similarly, the father of a family is more than the sire of some offspring. If he is a father, then he is also a teacher who by his example imparts to his children and his community something about truth, tradition, and moral responsibility -- about what there is to stand for and what we must refuse to stand for. A man, therefore, does not fully grow to manhood until he becomes a father; that is, until he becomes such a teacher and sets such an example, whether he actually sires children or not. That a father bears such a significance is demonstrated by the condition of families and communities that have been abandoned by their fathers.
<p>
Finally, the child born of the holy union of husband and wife signifies the dearness of all life and is a manifestation of holiness itself. If the world endures thanks to a direction we pursue, then it endures thanks to the child. For the child sets before us a direction and therefore a future, in which our most sublime aspirations, our most moving inspirations, and our most urgent questions might be decided. Those who have gazed into the eyes of an infant only seconds old and who have then looked up to behold the world transformed know what it means to realize, if only for a moment, what is infinitely precious. Infinity, you see, comes in small packages.
<p>
This gazing down upon the child is a looking up toward a height that elevates humanity from the realm of biology to the realm of spirituality. Here a survival of the strongest and the fittest is overtaken by a dwelling in the dearest and the highest. Without the home humanity loses this dimension of height that ordains and sanctifies all of being. Without the family we are left to a flat land that is a waste land and wander in an exile steeped in emptiness and indifference. Because the home and family have such a significance for human life, human meaning, and human values, a concern for the collapse and recovery of the home forms a significant part of much of the world's literature. For literature is not just a mirror held up to life. More than that, it is an interaction with life in the light of the truth that sustains life; it is part of the human seeking that takes us forever homeward. 
<p>
In order to illustrate this point, I have selected three literary masterpieces that address these issues in various ways. While they come from very different times and cultures, they represent a human condition that is as common to all humanity as motherhood, fatherhood, and childhood. They are the <i>Odyssey</i> of Homer, William Shakespeare's <i>King Lear</i>, and Leo Tolstoy's novel <i>Anna Karenina</i>. Let us consider, then, the various perspectives on home and family that these texts offer us. In doing so, we may see why these works, like home and family, are among the permanent things.

<p>
<b>An Exile's Movement Homeward: The <i>Odyssey</i> of Homer</b>
<p>
Most of us know the <i>Odyssey</i> as a tale of adventure, in which the hero undergoes various trials on his return to home and family from the Trojan War, a war fought over the break-up of a home. The adventures of Odysseus have a mythical quality that may at first keep his ordeals at a safe distance from us. But if we take a closer look at this tale, we discover its deeper, universal aspect precisely in its mythical features. For in myth, as Joseph Campbell has shown, a shallow mind may perceive only the local scenery, but a deeper mind encounters "all the stages of the Way from the ethnic to the elementary idea, from the local to the universal being, which is Everyman, as he both knows and is afraid to know."  In the case of Odysseus the stages of the Way lead not only from the local to the universal being, but also from exile to home, which is the dwelling place of Everyman, as he learns what there is to fear and what there is fear for.
<p>
Every tribulation that Odysseus must endure, then, entails overcoming a threat to the integrity and the sanctity of home and family. Here we shall consider a few familiar examples to make this point. Recall, for instance, what transpires in the Land of the Lotus Eaters. There, says Odysseus, anyone who ate of the lotus would "forget the way home."  What immediately comes to mind in this connection is the threat that drugs pose for every family in every home. But why, exactly, do drugs pose such a threat? 
<p>
First there are the obvious reasons:  Drugs lead to health problems, the squandering of resources, and a plummeting into irresponsibility. But Homer notes a deeper, more insidious threat to the home that underlies the obvious ones:  It is the loss of memory. In the <i>Republic</i> Plato teaches us that "we must not list the forgetful soul among the lovers of wisdom, but we require a good memory."  A good memory is the memory of the Good, which is the mark of wisdom itself. If the Good first manifests itself in the home, then wisdom entails an understanding of the significance of the home. And since the home is the place where our names are first uttered, the memory of home includes a memory of who and what we are, which is the memory of the responsibility to and for the Good that only we can meet. To be sure, to bear a family name is to bear this memory. Therefore, according to a Jewish legend, when we die and the Angel of Death comes to take us to the Holy One, we must answer a question before we can find our way to God:  What is your name?  For to know the answer to this question is to know the Good that opens up the path to the holy, which is the path that takes us homeward.
<p>
What must be remembered, moreover, as Homer indicates, is not just the home but the way home. The home is not something permanently given but something permanently sought, so that memory here is memory of a direction. And that makes it the memory of meaning. For to have meaning is to have a direction, and to have a direction is to be in motion toward a good that is yet to be fulfilled. Memory, then, orients us not only toward a good established in the past, but also toward a good to be sought in the future. And this good, in the words of Martin Buber, "is the movement in the direction of home," which is sustained by memory. Therefore, drugs threaten that movement homeward because drugs bring on oblivion, and in our world we have made oblivion into a multibillion-dollar business, not only in the drugs we peddle, but in the diversions we promote. Indeed, so dear to us is our deadly sleep that we ignore, ridicule, or even kill people who try to shake us from it.
<p>
In Homer's tale, as in our own time, then, we find that violence follows in the wake of oblivion. For after the Land of the Lotus Eaters Odysseus comes to the Land of the Cyclopians, where, says Homer, there are "no laws" and "no one cares for his neighbor."  There the Cyclops Polyphemos declares to Odysseus,
<p>
<bq>"Stranger, you are a simple fool, or come from far off, when you tell me to avoid the wrath of the gods or fear them. We do not concern ourselves over Zeus of the aegis, nor any of the rest of the blessed gods, since we are far better than they."</bq>
<P>
With these words -- and with the consistency of a logician -- Polyphemos proceeds to devour the companions of Odysseus.
<p>
The one-eyed monster here has a vision of only one thing:  a power that justifies anything -- that is what makes him monstrous. Where power is the only reality, there is no law other than the law dictated by the one in power. The monster does not act for his neighbor but manipulates his neighbor, even to the point of consuming him. And he has no regard for God because he sets himself up in the place of God, thereby regarding himself as better than God and in need of no one. Hence, he has no home that he might open to others but seals himself up in a tomb-like cave, like an animal holed up in his lair, without wife or children.
<p>
Violence toward others does violence to the home because violence is an assault on the Holy One who sanctifies the home in the sanctification of the family through holy matrimony. And because humanity comes into being with the appearance of the family, violence aimed at God is perpetrated upon humanity. "He who kills, kills God," Elie Wiesel has repeatedly said; the Eternal is eternally the victim. By contrast, those who would nurture life rather than take life enter into marriage and form a family by bringing life into the world. This nurturing of life entails not only bearing children, but also affirming the sanctity of the other human being, beginning with our husband or wife. Matrimony derives its holiness from this saying of you to another person in such a way that we attest to the holiness of the other that derives from the Holy One Himself. This relation that lies at the heart of the family makes all other relations meaningful. For this is the relation that opens up a higher truth that is opposed to power. As we see in the case of the Cyclops, without this truth that is revealed in the home there is no law or care for our neighbor. And so it is no coincidence that those who do violence to others generally come from broken homes. When homes break up bodies get broken.
<P>
The oblivion that leads to violence against others also takes the insidious form of a subtle violence done to oneself, as well as to others, in the mode of sensuality. Here, as in the case of violence, getting physical means being reduced to a purely physical, animalistic nature, as Homer's <i>Odyssey</i> suggests. After escaping from the Cyclops, Odysseus makes his way to the island where the sorceress Circe lives. There his men are tempted by the voluptuous beauty of the sorceress, who gives them fine foods poisoned with a drug "to make them wholly forget their native land," as Homer says. And she then turns them into pigs. But they had already forgotten their native land as soon as they acted on the sensual, and they had already lost their human image as soon as they succumbed to their animalistic nature. When animal instinct overtakes moral responsibility, the human form becomes the form of a pig, and the home is reduced to a sty.
<p>
In contrast to this succumbing to temptation we have the refusal to succumb on the part of Odysseus when he was marooned on the island of Calypso. There he tells the goddess,
"I know that...Penelope can never match the impression you make for beauty and stature. She is mortal after all, and you are immortal and ageless. But even so, what I want and all my days I pine for is to go back to my house and see my day of homecoming."
<p>
Like Circe, Calypso possesses all that sensual beauty can offer. But the home is constituted by the spiritual, and not by the sensual. And the difference lies in the caress. In the groping and grabbing of sensuality, we manipulate and appropriate the other for ourselves, for our own pleasure. The caress, however, is an opening and offering of the self to another, whether it is between husband and wife or parent and child. It is an instance of a contact not between skin and skin but between soul and soul -- that is what makes it spiritual rather than sensual. The caress, therefore, seeks what cannot be touched. It seeks what lies at the heart of the home, and it reveals what lives in the heart of the family. For without the loving caress, neither home nor family can come into being.
<p>
Thus the <i>Odyssey</i> culminates in a husband's caress of his wife, and it ends with his embrace of his father. His return to his family includes a return both to the one with whom he brings life into the world and to one who lies at the origin of his life. Returned to both, Odysseus returns to a responsibility for life, which means:  He returns to the family.
<P>
The threat to the family, however, comes not only from without, as in the tale of Odysseus, but also from within. This brings us to the next work we shall consider.
<P>

<b>The Undermining of a Family: Shakespeare's <i>King Lear</i></b>
<p>
<i>King Lear</i> is a drama about the premature collapse and failed recovery of a monarch's household. While Homer's epic generally unfolds in the external geography of adventure, Shakespeare's play focuses more on the internal struggle of a soul trying to regain a native ground that has crumbled out from under him. But what exactly threatens the home and family of the King and, indeed, brings them to ruin?
<p>
The home and family in this drama come to ruin as the result of a fundamental confusion about nature and natural law, where natural law may be understood much as Thomas Aquinas understands it. Natural law, he explains in the <i>Summa Theologiae</i>, is "the participation in eternal law by rational creatures," and eternal law is defined as "the rational governance of everything on the part of God."  The idea here is that God operates by design and that, since they bear the image of divine being, human beings have a responsibility to become part of that design. The rational governance of Providence implies an ordering of the world with the aim of pursuing the Good, that is, with the aim of attesting to what is most precious in life. Natural law, therefore, establishes a bond between the human being and divine being; it summons humanity to take up a path that would nurture and sanctify life, as God sanctifies life when He pronounces it to be "very good."  Inasmuch as the relation between the holy and the human finds its first expression in the home and family, the life that unfolds in this realm bears witness to a natural law expressive of a sacred aim in life.
<p>
King Lear's confusion, then, is a fundamental confusion about the life that unfolds in the home, and it is revealed in his relation to the surviving members of his family, his daughters Regan, Goneril, and Cordelia. In the play's opening scene Lear does not offer his daughters a loving embrace expressive of a higher relation, according to the family bond determined by natural law. Instead, he arranges a business transaction, whereby he tries to purchase their words of affection by offering them portions of his wealth. Two of his daughters, Regan and Goneril, are eager to exploit this confusion that undermines the family:  They exchange the testimony to life as determined by natural law for lifeless property. And so the seeds of death are sown.
<p>
The bond of love that is established by natural law to sustain the family, on the other hand, is precisely what Cordelia invokes when she declares to her father,
<p>
"I love your majesty<br>
According to my bond, no more nor less." (I.i)
<p>
It is not that Cordelia knows her place, but rather that she knows what is placed on high. Inclined toward a higher responsibility, she obeys the commandment of natural law, and not the whim of the King. But Lear insists upon the false authority of his own whims:  Rejecting Cordelia's simple affirmation of her bond, he refuses what natural law commands. Refusing the commandment of natural law, he loses his relation to the eternal law that sustains the home and sanctifies the family. And so he is left homeless, turned over to the merciless power of the elements as exemplified by the storms in the fields. There he has no dwelling place, for there he is exiled from the truth of natural law.
<p>
Usurping the authority of natural law, Lear loses his identity both as the king of a realm and as the father of a family. Here we realize that the task with which natural law confronts us is not simply to follow some rule, but to be who we are. And who we are is defined by the eternal truth that sanctifies the family. Thus, as soon as Lear violates his family by casting out Cordelia, his daughter Regan notes that "he hath ever but slenderly known himself" (I.i). For he knows himself only by the power of manipulation, and not by the truth of family relation. Once he becomes powerless in the face of his daughters' deception, Lear himself cries out, "Who is it that can tell me who I am?"  (I.iv). He does not know himself because he does not know himself as a father, and he is a father before he is a king. To know himself as a father would be to know the natural law that binds him to his daughters in truth, and not through power.
<p>
Therefore, as we recall, Cordelia alone speaks the truth, for she alone knows the bond of nature that ties her to her father and, through her father, to a higher truth. Hence, it is she, says Shakespeare,
<p>
"Who redeems nature from the general curse<br>
Which twain have brought her to." (IV. vi)
<p>
Cordelia works this redemption by restoring to Lear the relation between father and child -- and with it the higher relation -- that her sisters have undone. But this undoing was also Lear's doing. Like most of those who exchange the truth of natural law for the power of human arrogance, he reaps what he has sown. The man who had understood himself only in terms of the power he could wield is overpowered and eventually crushed by the two daughters who would wrench power away from him. 
<p>
The corruption of nature and the destruction of the family exemplified by Regan and Goneril manifests itself not only in their treatment of their father, but also in the violence that they bring down upon Gloucester by blinding him. The central figure in the play's subplot, he is a father who is betrayed by his child Edmond and who mistakenly suspects his son Edgar of betrayal. Like Regan and Goneril, it is the bastard son Edmond who is the "unnatural villain" (I.ii), as Gloucester states it, and whose villainy includes the betrayal not only of his father, but also of Cornwall and Albany, the husbands of Regan and Goneril, respectively. For part of his power play involves making promises to take up with each of these wives who are Lear's daughters. And, having betrayed their father, they are all too willing to betray their husbands and chase after Edmond.
<P>
Thus, the violation of the relation between parent and child entails the violation of the relation between husband and wife:  The family is assaulted at every turn by those who would be a law unto themselves in a usurpation of natural law. And so when Albany suspects his wife's treachery, he says to her, 
<p>
"O Goneril,<br>
You are not worth the dust which the rude wind<br>
Blows in your face. I fear your disposition:<br>
That nature which contemns its origin<br>
Cannot be bordered certain in itself."  (IV. ii)
<p>
That nature which contemns its origin -- the child who dishonors her father -- is a perverted nature that despises the family. Despising this origin of humanity, such a nature has nothing to limit its contempt for humanity. Goneril, then, divorces herself from all the limitations of natural law, which, as we have seen, is our link to the eternal law that sanctifies the family and all of humanity. Thus divorced from the family, Goneril is cut off from the origin of all that is holy in human life and ends by murdering her two sisters. And the murder of Cordelia, of course, results in the death of her father Lear.
<p>
Set in a time that came long before Shakespeare's time, this play continues to speak to us in our own time. As a commentary on our own humanity, it sheds light on the ways in which we, too, stand by and tolerate the assault on the family. It tells us, for example, something about the sickness of a society that hides away its parents to die in "homes" that are the antithesis of a home and that leaves the care of its children to people who are not their parents. It reveals to us a connection between murder and adultery, between the hand that steals, the mouth that lies, and the eye that covets. For all of these things belong to a nature that contemns its origin and therefore has nothing but contempt for the family. All of them result from the undermining of the natural law that lies at the center of the home and that links the life of the family to the life of the eternal. 
<p>
In these last five transgressions I have mentioned you will recognize the second five of the Ten Commandments. Here we may recall an ancient Jewish teaching, according to which the Ten Commandments were written on two tablets in order to designate two realms of relation. The first five commandments pertain to the relation of <i>adam la Makom</i>, or the human relation to the divine, and the second five pertain to the relation of <i>adam l'adam</i>, or the human relation to other human beings. What is of interest to the concern at hand is this:  The commandment to honor mother and father belongs to the first category. Which means:  The integrity of the family belongs to the integrity of the divine. Holding to the sanctity of the family, therefore, is prior to the sanctification of all other realms of human relation. Once Lear's daughters violate the family and destroy the home, there is no crime that they cannot commit. And justify.
<p>
Thus, the truth that comes to us through <i>King Lear</i> arises in an antiquity that long precedes it and lives in a modernity that far exceeds it. Truly among the permanent things, this truth finds another expression in a literary masterpiece that appears nearly three centuries after Shakespeare's play. Which brings us to the third work to be considered.

<p>
<b>Families Lost and Found: Leo Tolstoy's <i>Anna Karenina</i></b>
<p>
Tolstoy's masterful novel <i>Anna Karenina</i> has found its way into the popular culture through various film versions, including one starring Christopher Reeve that was made for television. Generally speaking, the popular view of the novel that has resulted from these films is that it is the tale of an exciting but tragic love affair between a frustrated housewife and a dashing young aristocrat. Like many popular conceptions, however, this is a misconception. Tolstoy's aim in his portrayal of the adulterous love affair is to expose the moral corruption that leads to the dissolution of the family. And he makes this point by contrasting Anna's love affair with Levin's marriage.
<p>
A key to the contrast that Tolstoy sets up is the figure of the child; indeed, as we have noted, it is with the appearance of a child that a family comes into being. Should anyone suppose that Anna's affair with Vronsky is exciting and wonderful, we have only to recall Tolstoy's account of how this indulgence devastates her son Seryozha. He is described as "the compass which showed [his mother and her lover] the degree of their divergence from what they knew was right, but did not want to see."  It is not as a judge, however, that Seryozha reveals to them their divergence from what is right. Rather, it is as a victim. Because he is a child, he represents a precious but fragile possibility for life; because he is a child, he embodies the meaning and direction that open up a future in which some redemption from a life void of meaning may be sought. Hence, the child is the core of home and family. And the child is just the one who is betrayed in Anna's illicit love affair.
<p>
"I love two beings only," says Anna of Seryozha and her lover Vronsky, "but the one excludes the other."  And we know which one she chooses. After she has left her family, one of Seryozha's "favorite occupations," says Tolstoy, "was keeping a lookout for his mother during his walks."  But she is almost never to be seen. Once she has a child by Vronsky, in fact, we are told that "the separation from her son...did not trouble her," since she had grown so attached to the daughter she had by Vronsky "that she rarely thought of her son."  And yet the declaration of her love for "two beings only" was made long after the birth of her daughter. This attachment too, therefore, is soon eclipsed by her preoccupation with Vronsky's love for her and with a personal happiness that is forever longed for but never realized. 
<p>
Why is it never realized?  Because in truth Anna loves no being other than the counterfeit being she has fashioned by making herself her own heroine in a romance whose outcome is determined from the start. Living with her lover in a house that is not a home and in an arrangement that is inimical to marriage, she exchanges a family life for the illusion of a love life. To her, happiness is my happiness, and not the happiness of her family. Thus, becoming a sign only of herself, and not of the significance of the other human being, Anna is drained of all significance. Like Narcissus at the pool, she gazes into the mirror of her self-styled fairy tale until, as Tolstoy says, she no longer recognizes herself. For she has lost the image of wife and mother that would be the basis of such recognition. The only action that remains for her to establish some significance in life is to take her own life. This she does without a thought for the children who would be orphaned by her action.
<p>
What is missing from Anna's love for Vronsky is precisely the love that forms the basis of the family, which is a love for the other person expressive of a higher relation. It is the love for the holy, as it is evinced by the love between husband and wife, the love that puts the holy into holy matrimony. Only when marriage rests on such a foundation can a family come into being. In <i>Anna Karenina</i> Tolstoy illustrates this point through the tale of Levin, which is the tale of a movement into life that runs counter to the story of the title character.
<p>
Modeled after the author himself, Levin is a man who is engaged in a constant struggle for meaning in life. And it is through the pursuit of family life that meaning in life finally opens up to him. In contrast to Anna, who sets up a household with a man to whom she is not married, Levin enters into marriage with Kitty under the auspices of the Church. Despite his religious skepticism at the time, he embraces the prayers said at his wedding. When, for example, he hears the words "Give unto them perfect love, peace and help, O Lord," he is struck by them, thinking, "How did they know that it is help, yes, help, that one needs?"  And when he hears the priest say, "Who unitest them that were separated and who hast ordained for them an insoluble union in love," he realizes, "How profound those words are and how they fit with what one feels at this moment!"  Thus, he sees that the words addressed to One who is above consecrate the marriage between two here below.
<p>
Levin continues to engage in a struggle for life's meaning in the face of death even after he is married. But, "thanks to his wife's presence," says Tolstoy, this struggle "did not drive him to despair:  in spite of death he felt the need for living and loving."  For his wife's presence signifies the presence of the sacred in his life, as it was invoked on the occasion of his marriage. Unlike Anna, who sought to be loved by Vronsky outside of marriage, Levin seeks to offer his love to the wife he has taken in holy matrimony, and that is what sustains him in life. Knowing his wife, he comes to know something of life's origin; moving toward life's origin, he moves toward a meaning in life that is stronger than death.
<p>
Through this love that links him to the origin of life, he joins with his wife to bear life into the world. Here too, of course, the figure of the child is crucial to the condition of the home and family. Contrary to Anna's disregard for her children, Levin sees in the birth of his child a revelation of something beyond the human. And so we read, "The birth of a son, which they promised him, but which he still could not believe in -- so extraordinary did it seem -- appeared to him on the one hand such an immense and therefore impossible happiness, and on the other hand such a mysterious event that the assumed knowledge of what was going to happen and, as a result of it, preparations as for something ordinary, something human beings themselves were responsible for, seemed scandalous and degrading to him."  Thus, upon the birth of his child -- if only for a moment -- his skepticism gives way to a deeper vision, to a higher vision, and a prayer comes to his lips in spite of himself, as though the prayer had a life of its own. All his doubts, says Tolstoy, "fell away, like dust, from his soul. To whom else was he to appeal, if not to Him in whose hands he felt himself, his soul, and his love to be?"  The vessel of this revelation?  A newborn babe.
<p>
This vision of a mystery that transcends the handiwork of humanity is precisely a vision of the family. The vision unfolds as the family emerges in a place where there had been two but there are now three. And it is the vision of the family that makes it possible for Levin to receive the meaning in life that he has sought all along, a meaning that is as essential to the soul as bread is to the body. Near the end of the novel he meets a peasant who offers him the key to what he had struggled for, expressed in deceptively simple terms:  Live for God, and not for yourself. At first these words seem so simple to Levin as to be meaningless. But then he thinks to himself, "Well?  Did I not understand those meaningless words?"  And he answers himself, "No, I understood them just as he understands them:  I understood them perfectly and better than I understand anything in life, and I have never in my life doubted it or could doubt it." 
<p>
And yet he does not fully grasp the truth of the peasant's words until he sees his wife and son nearly killed by a bolt of lightning. Seeing their lives threatened, he sees what his own life is for. What does it mean to live for God and not for yourself?  It means living for your family and thereby creating a home through which the holy may enter life and instill it with meaning. As God breathed life into the first human being, the family breathes life into all humanity. Only where such a breath is drawn can dwelling happen. And only where dwelling happens do we approach a realm called home.
<p>

<b>Concluding Thoughts</b>
<p>
While the literary masterpieces we have considered are varied in their approach to home and family, they do have a few things in common. In all three cases, for example, the assault on home and family entails a violation of holy matrimony. Recall, for example, the suitors who invade the home of Odysseus, Edmond's designs on Regan and Goneril, and Anna Karenina's love affair. And we find that when the holiness of marriage is threatened, the holiness of human life is compromised:  The suitors plot to kill Telemachus, Goneril plans the murder of Cordelia, and Anna ends by killing herself.
<p>
In all three cases, moreover, the issue of a wife's fidelity is directly tied to the presence of the mother. Because Penelope remains faithful to Odysseus, she remains a mother to Telemachus; therefore, it is thanks to her that Odysseus has a home and family to return to. Anna Karenina cannot take up with Vronsky without abandoning her child Seryozha; in contrast to her betrayal we have Kitty's faithfulness to Levin, which ultimately makes it possible for Levin to realize what is most dear in life. And in Shakespeare's play the mother is absent altogether because the devotion of a wife to a husband is altogether absent; there the absence of the mother is symbolically manifested in Lear's alienation from the earth itself when he is turned over to the chaos of the stark elements.
<p>
Similarly, all three works address the role of the father as a teacher and a witness. Odysseus is able to restore the integrity of his home, which includes a return to his own father, because he has attested to the higher relation that home and family signify. When, as in the case of Lear, that testimony is absent, the home and family collapse; Lear's tragedy is that by the time he realizes who he is as a father, the consequences of his absence as a father are already in place. And in Tolstoy's novel we find that only when Levin becomes a father does there open up for him an avenue to the Most High enabling him to recognize his responsibility for what is most sacred here below.
<p>
All three of these masterpieces also bear witness to the importance of the child to the sanctity of home and family and to the meaning of life itself. Before he relates the trials of Odysseus, for example, Homer establishes the position of Telemachus as the son of Odysseus and as the heir to his wisdom. If Penelope makes it possible for Odysseus to return to a home established in the past, Telemachus receives a legacy that posits a future necessary to the family. In the case of Lear, the presence or absence of the child parallels the presence or absence of his own identity. Lear is who he is -- and therefore might become more than he is -- only through his relation to Cordelia. In <i>Anna Karenina</i>, we recall, Anna's child reveals to her a moral path that she is summoned to follow, and Levin's child shows him the way to salvation. Indeed, in all three of these works the child bears a salvific significance.
<P>
What does all of this tell us about our own condition and the salvation that we are all in need of?  In a word, it tells us that if we are not mothers, nothing has value; if we are not fathers, we ourselves are nothing; and if we have no children, everything is meaningless. And yet, as never before, the mother, father, and child are under massive assault in our society. As in the literary works we have considered, that assault begins with an assault on holy matrimony, which is an assault on the holy itself. Divorce rates, for instance, are staggering, and they are higher among people who live together before they get married than among those who do not. Why?  Because those who live together out of wedlock have no regard for the sanctity of marriage. 
<p>
Premarital and extramarital sex, moreover, is not only tolerated -- it is romanticized and is therefore encouraged. Sex, I have been told, is a way of "getting to know someone."  No longer, then, is the sexual relation understood to be an expression of a higher relation, whereby a husband and wife join with the Creator to bring life into the world. Indeed, the last thing that most people want when they engage in sex is to become a mother or a father. Therefore, the question raised in the sexual relation is not "How do I express my devotion to God through this relation to another human being?"  but rather "Am I protected?"  And yet the more we are concerned with this protection, the more we plunge into ruin.
<p>
Because the sexual relation is central to bearing life into the world, our views on sex are directly tied to the value we place on human life. And as sex becomes more casual, motherhood and fatherhood become more corrupt. Instead of viewing motherhood as a blessing, we view abortion as a right. Women who have babies and decide to be mothers by staying home with their children are taken to be either deprived or deficient and are made to feel that they have to apologize for some transgression. As for fathers, they are held to no standards at all. Many abandon their families altogether, and when fathers are absent communities collapse into a combination of lotus eaters and Cyclopians -- those among whom the life of the other human being means nothing.
<p>
I am not speaking only of city neighborhoods where most households are headed by single mothers. No, the entire land has taken on the aspect of the Land of the Lotus Eaters. There is no evidence more convincing or more terrible to support this than the fact that the most common form of death among children between 15 and 19 years of age is the death related to drugs and alcohol. This has come to be the case not because our children have failed to learn what we teach them, but because they have learned all too well and have followed our teachings to their logical conclusions. These are the teachings that regard the family as a social unit, and not as a center of life's sanctity; that regard the ego as the center of the universe, and not as the seat of responsibility to and for the other human being; and that take morality to be a cultural curiosity, and not a means of expressing our relation to the God who summons us to be moral.
<p>
As in the case of Odysseus, violence follows in the wake of the lotus. And, of course, violence in the streets finds its way into the home. It goes by the scandalous name of "domestic violence."  Domestic violence is not the cause of the breakdown of the family; it is the result of that breakdown. For domestic violence is the outcome of a loss of the sacred in life, and the family is the primary ground for the manifestation of what is sacred. A man who understands his relation to his wife to be an expression of a relation to the Most High is far less likely to beat her than a man who has no such understanding. A father who sees that his children are a blessing from God and the basis of all there is to hold dear is far less likely to abuse them than one who has no such insight.
<P>
But we shall remain blind to this understanding and insight as long as we send women into wars, give the nod to abortions on demand, grant divorces without grounds, romanticize adultery, and accord so-called homosexual marriage the same status as a marriage that can bring children into the world. Much more than the signs of changing times, these are the signs of the loss of meaning; much more than the manifestation of cultural evolution, they are a manifestation of cultural collapse. As Abraham Joshua Heschel once said, "We have bartered holiness for convenience, loyalty for success, wisdom for information, prayers for sermons, tradition for fashion."  Which amounts to saying:  We have traded the home for the void and the family for the abyss.
<p>
Cultural restoration not only begins at home, as Russell Kirk has pointed out; it begins with the restoration of the home and of the family that constitutes the home. If home and family are indeed among the permanent things, as the literature we have discussed indicates, they require a permanent vigilance. For the permanent things are the most precious things. And nothing is more fragile than what is most precious.

<h3>The Mystic Chords of Memory: Reclaiming American History</h3>
<b>By Wilfred M. McClay</b>
<p>
<a href="/heritage/kirk/kirklect.html">The Russell Kirk Memorial Lectures</a>, Delivered December 
13, 1995
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;I am delighted to be with you this afternoon and to have a role in the Heritage Foundation's worthy 
project of commemorating Russell Kirk's many contributions to American intellectual life. My own 
task today is to explore the subject of historical consciousness in America -- a subject about which, 
strange to say, Russell Kirk actually did not write a great deal, at least not addressing the subject 
directly. But he didn't need to. His entire life and work were nothing less than an extended 
elaboration of that very theme. Historical consciousness seemed to have been infused into the air he 
breathed and mixed into the soil of the ancestral land in which he chose to live. No place or thing, 
however ordinary, was too humble for him to grant it the dignity of a story. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;One notices this historical tendency even in Kirk's language. It has a most peculiar lilt, which often 
charms and sometimes startles the reader with its unexpectedly fanciful and antique echoes. (As an 
example of the latter, I remember being shocked when I read Kirk describe a leading social critic as 
an exemplar of "defecated intellect" -- shocked, that is, until I looked the word up, and saw that 
Kirk used the word in an older and more etymologically informed sense than my own, strictly 
scatological understanding.) What struck many readers as mannered or affected diction in Kirk was 
actually something quite different. It was evidence of his strong conviction that words, like people, 
are living things, bearing living pasts deserving of recognition and respect. That was typical of him. 
He had the ability to make even the dullest things gleam with the luster of historical imagination. 
With all due respect to Governor John Engler, who inaugurated this series of lectures, who would 
have thought that Michigan could ever be made a name to conjure with?  Yet Kirk made his many 
readers curious to see his beloved "stump country" and to explore the tiny burg of Mecosta. 
Although his Gothic and Romantic tastes drew him to old European cathedrals, Roman ruins, and 
other such haunted sites, he was not prone to sigh, in the perennial complaint of American writers 
such as Hawthorne and Henry James, that America was too new or raw or commerce-minded to be 
the stuff of art. On the contrary, Kirk knew how to see monuments, and ruins, everywhere he 
looked. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;What others called "junk" Kirk thought of as "cultural debris," which is a short way of saying that 
Kirk took a long view of the disorders of our contemporary American world, seeing them in light of 
the thousand follies and disorders that have come before us in the human procession. Historical 
consciousness gave him a broad, capacious vision, which always insisted that the civilization we 
enjoy has deep living roots. Those roots of American order extend back in time not only to 18th-
century Philadelphia, but further back, to London, Rome, Athens, and Jerusalem. Virtually 
everything he wrote testified to his intense awareness of the immanence, inescapability, and 
indispensability of the past, and not only the past of the previous generation or two, but the distant 
past -- the past of the Law and the Prophets, of Solon, Cicero, Augustine, the English constitution, 
Montesquieu, Burke, Lincoln. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Kirk's career, then, went against the American grain, and it did so in two different ways. In the first 
place, he was an intellectual genuinely at ease in America. He may have fancied himself a 
Bohemian Tory, but he was never that most tiresome of bores, "the alienated American 
intellectual," a restless species that grazes in herds of independent minds. He knew he was fortunate 
to live in a country free and prosperous enough to permit him a career as an independent writer, and 
he never forgot that fact. But at the same time, he was never an uncritical celebrant of American 
culture. He loved his country, but he did not idolize it. Instead, he held it accountable to a 
transcendent standard, against which he often found it seriously wanting. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In particular, Kirk lamented the deification of progress, the cult of absolute equality, the advance of 
the Leviathan state, the licentiousness of the autonomous self, the transvaluation of values, and 
other such modern abstractions that have transformed and eroded the American republic. While he 
vehemently opposed ideology in all its forms, including conservative ideology, he at the same time 
lamented Americans' fixation upon short-term, practical, problem-solving, results-oriented, and 
utility-maximizing thinking in place of a deeper reflection upon the proper ends of things. Kirk, 
then, was trying to do something characteristic of traditionalist conservatives: fight on two fronts at 
once. He was defending the American way of life against its cultured despisers -- while at the same 
time challenging many elements of that way of life by holding it up to its classical and Judeo-
Christian antecedents. He comforted the afflicted and afflicted the comfortable -- and sometimes 
they were the same people. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Kirk was not the only one to act this way. Many American conservatives feel caught in a similar 
bind. Most of them are dyed-in-the-wool patriots, and yet they wonder whether the very America 
they so ardently defend is only too willing to sell its birthright for a mess of pottage -- or, for the 
more ideologically inclined, a pot of message. Even here at Heritage, which is a very busy, worldly 
place, teeming with clever people and clever ideas addressing themselves to the immediate concrete 
policy questions and debates of the day, one is likely to encounter that very American question: Of 
what use is historical consciousness? 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The dangers inherent in this characteristically American attitude are wonderfully illuminated by a 
joke I heard the other day, which with your indulgence I will retell -- not only because it bears 
directly upon the point, but because storytelling seems a very Kirkean way to get at a Kirkean truth. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The tale begins with a tourist, wandering through the back alleys of San Francisco's Chinatown, 
where he comes upon a little antique shop, filled with curious pieces of statuary and other art 
objects. What especially catches his eye is a beautifully wrought, life-size bronze statue of a rat. He 
asks the elderly shopkeeper for the rat's price. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"The rat costs twelve dollars," says the shopkeeper, "and it will be a thousand dollars more for the 
story behind it."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"Well, you can keep the story, old man," responds the tourist, "but I'll take the rat."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;After buying the rat, the tourist leaves the store, carrying his newly acquired statue under his arm. 
As he crosses the street in front of the store, he sees two live rats emerge from a sewer drain and fall 
into step behind him. He looks nervously over his shoulder and starts to walk faster. Soon more rats 
appear and begin to follow him. In a few minutes rats are coming out of every sewer, basement, 
vacant lot, and landfill, forming themselves into swarms and packs and massing in step behind him. 
People on the street point and shout at him as the pursuing rats force him into a trot, and then a dead 
run. But no matter how fast he runs, the rats, now squeaking and squealing grotesquely, stay right 
behind him. By the time he reaches the water's edge, the line of rats trailing him extends back for 
twelve city blocks. Finally, in desperation, the tourist leaps as high as he can up onto a lamppost 
and hugs it by one arm while, with the other, he flings the bronze rat far out into the waters of San 
Francisco Bay. To his amazement, the hordes of rats race right by him and follow the statue, 
surging over the breakwater and leaping into the Bay -- and then promptly drowning. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Whereupon the tourist hurries back up to the antique shop. When he appears at the door, the 
shopkeeper smiles knowingly and says, "Ah, yes, sir. So now you've seen what the statue can do, 
and you've come back to find out the story?" 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"No, no, no," replies the tourist excitedly. "Now I want to buy a bronze statue of a lawyer!"
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There's nothing more rich with cultural meaning than humor. Clearly the main point of this joke is 
its hardwired animus toward lawyers. But there's another point, too. The tourist in this story is a 
man interested only in immediate results, and things, and in what those things can be deployed to 
do. He couldn't care less about "knowing the story."  And the punch line assumes that we pretty 
much agree with him. If the statue eradicates lawyers, who cares how it works?  A picture may be 
worth a thousand words, but no story is worth a thousand bucks. Such is the characteristic 
American attitude toward the past -- You can keep your story, old man; I'll take the rat. But the 
tourist makes a completely unwarranted universalistic assumption -- that all bronze statues from 
this shop will have the same effect. How can he know that, until he has heard "the story?"  His lack 
of interest in "the story" is not only philistine; it is foolish. Hasn't he learned that you get what you 
pay for?  Yet this is the sort of mechanistic attitude, which has rightly been called "crackpot 
realism," that Kirk always had to battle -- as do all of us who care about the American past and 
about the state of our historical consciousness. For you can't really appreciate the statuary of 
American political and institutional life, or know the value of American liberty and prosperity, 
unless you pay the price of learning the story. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Of course, we also now have another, very different, problem: that the older "story" of the 
American past is increasingly regarded, especially by our academic historians, as nothing but a 
story of rats, which is another way of saying that the struggle to reclaim historical consciousness in 
contemporary America has to occur on two different fronts, too. It is one thing to believe the past is 
unworthy of our attention. It's another thing to assert that it is unworthy of our respect. We now 
confront both of these attitudes at once, and it is hard to say which is the more threatening. It is 
alarming to have our suspicion confirmed, most recently by a Department of Education survey of 
22,000 American schoolchildren, that our young people are learning next to nothing about 
American history. But it is equally alarming to contemplate what passes for historical study in the 
academy, the arena in which our leaders are educated. There the reign of identity politics and 
political correctness has, if anything, only fortified its hold in recent years. It sometimes seems that, 
to paraphrase the old blues song, if it wasn't for bad history, we wouldn't have no history at all. 
Indeed, it is a melancholy thing to reflect, as I sometimes do, that the only consolation to be had for 
the execrable courses our students endure is the fact that they won't remember them after they 
graduate. Unfortunately, though, they may not remember any of the good stuff either. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It's time, then, to recover some fairly basic truths. Historical consciousness is to civilized society 
what memory is to individual identity. One cannot say who or what one is -- one can't say one is 
anyone, or anything, at all -- without some selective retention of experience and source of 
continuity. One cannot learn, use language, pass on knowledge, raise offspring, or even dwell in 
society without the aid of memory. Without memory there are no workable rules of conduct, no 
standard of justice, no basis for restraining passions, no sense of the connection between an action 
and its consequences. There can be no sense of the future, as a moment in time we know will come, 
because we remember that other tomorrows have come, too. And there can be no recognition of the 
sacred, no act of consecration or devotion to the unseen -- for nothing exists but the proximate and 
the sensate. A culture without memory will necessarily be barbarous, no matter how 
technologically advanced and sophisticated, because the daily drumbeat of artificial sensations and 
amplified events will drown out all other sounds, including the strains of an older music.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In our day, even the academic study of history has begun to yield to such barbarism. For an 
increasing number of younger historians, the whole point of studying the past is to "prove" that all 
our inherited institutions, beliefs, conventions, and normative values are arbitrary -- mere "social 
constructions" in the service of ignoble power -- and are therefore utterly without legitimacy or 
authority. In this view, it is absurd to imagine that the study of the past could have any purpose 
beyond serving the immediate needs of the present -- and anyone who thinks otherwise is either 
disingenuous or stupid. The very idea of being enlarged or drawn out of ourselves by encountering 
the strangeness of the past -- and the strange familiarity of the past -- now seems quite beside the 
point. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Kirk's view of the matter was different, first of all because, for him, the past was a land of 
enchantment, pervaded with flitting shadows and ghostly presences. But it was also the source of 
what little real solidity there is to be found in the world. The study of the past, he believed, should 
cause us to recognize the ways that the past has authority over us. For historical consciousness, as 
he understood it, is not merely an awareness of the past and of one's own connection to it. It is the 
cultivation of respect for what cannot be seen, for the invisible sources of meaning and authority in 
our lives -- for the formative agents and foundational principles that, although no longer tangible, 
have made possible what is worthy in our own day. To borrow from the language of religious faith, 
the tutelage of historical consciousness teaches us what it means to walk by faith, and not only by 
sight. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;We see, then, that historical knowledge and historical consciousness are two very different things; 
and the acquisition of historical consciousness, properly understood, will have to be something 
different from the academic study of history -- though the latter does not preclude the former. The 
acquisition of historical consciousness means learning the discipline of memory, which is far more 
than a matter of personal memory -- though that is, of course, where it begins and ends. Historical 
consciousness means learning to appropriate into our own moral imagination, and learning to be 
guided by, the distilled memories of others, the stories of things we never experienced firsthand. It 
means learning to make these things our own, learning to look out at the world we experience 
through their filter, learning to feel the living presence of the past inhering in the seeming inertness 
of the world as it is given to us. Of course, discernment between and among memories is of great 
importance. Not all are worth preserving, and not all are reliable. Here is where the practice of 
professional historians has been especially valuable, in preserving so much that would otherwise be 
lost and in ferreting out the evidence for certain propositions while uncovering the faulty basis for 
others. But the advocate of historical consciousness is likely to give preference to those memories 
whose importance and reliability have been established not merely by a select committee of the 
American Historical Association, but also by the passage of time. To repeat, historical knowledge 
and historical consciousness are different things, and the latter can never become the province of a 
historical priesthood.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;An outside observer cannot easily tell when an individual's vision of reality itself has been 
transformed. No one else can see with another person's eyes, feel with another person's heart. But 
let us imagine a visitor to the battlefield at Gettysburg who knows the history of that battle and war, 
knows the text of Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, and knows something of subsequent American 
history -- not only knows these things, but has digested and internalized this knowledge. That 
visitor will experience something very different on his visit from what an uninformed eight-year-
old child will see. What the educated observer sees when he gazes at the modest grassy bump of 
Cemetery Ridge will be, in a sense, more real than what the unimpressed young child sees, even 
though they are looking at the same thing. Such an example undercuts the positivistic notion that 
we live in a world of inert facts to which we impute values. Insofar as we are historical, 
remembering creatures, we inevitably participate in the meanings that we apprehend -- a mysterious 
form of participant knowledge that is, as John Lukacs argues, something very different from mere 
subjectivity. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Part of what makes our visitor different, too, is the fact that he comes to Gettysburg as a part of 
what sociologists call a "community of memory."  His reactions are not determined merely by his 
idiosyncratic impressions, though he may well have had some, or by his extensive knowledge, 
however detailed it may be. Instead, he is one of many people who remember what happened in 
that place, and in some way he is connected to all of them, to all who are bound together by 
remembrance of that story. In the end, communities and nation-states are constituted and sustained 
by such shared memories -- by stories of foundation, conflict, and perseverance. The leap of 
imagination and faith, from the thinness and unreliability of our individual memory to the richness 
of collective memory, that is the leap of civilized life; and the discipline of collective memory is the 
task not only of the historian, but of every one of us. Historical consciousness draws us out of a 
narrow preoccupation with the present and with our "selves," and ushers us into another, larger 
world -- a public world that "cultures" us, in all the senses of that word.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Historical consciousness is, then, part of the cement that holds America together and makes us 
willing to strive and sacrifice on her behalf. One might think of the Gettysburg Address as an 
exemplary text in this respect, since it sought to give meaning to the suffering of the present 
precisely by reference to the visionary sacrifices of the Founders. Instead of deconstructing the past 
in the name of the present, it reinterpreted the present by reference to the past. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;An even better example, however, is Lincoln's first inaugural address, from which the haunting 
phrase in my title, "The Mystic Chords of Memory," is taken. To understand what sort of appeal 
Lincoln was making with these words, we need to recall the setting in which the address was given 
in March of 1861. In the wake of Lincoln's election to the presidency in 1860 without the support of 
a single Southern state, seven states from the Deep South had already left the Union, and the crucial 
border states were on the verge of doing so as well. The Union that Lincoln so greatly cherished 
seemed to be dissolving before his eyes. With this inaugural speech, Lincoln began his attempt to 
counter this disintegration. He made it clear that, so far as he was concerned, the union of states 
under the Constitution could not be broken, for it was meant to be a perpetual union, rather than 
being revocable at the whim of a single state or combination of states. The speech takes a variety of 
turns, offering legal, political, moral, and prudential reasons for its case. Its tone is by turns both 
conciliatory and stern. But with its final clinching paragraph -- added (it is said) at the suggestion of 
William Henry Seward -- the speech soars to immortal heights: 
<p><blockquote>
	&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;I am loath to close. We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies. 
Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection. The 
mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to 
every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus 
of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our 
nature.
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It is a rich, complex, intricately balanced sentence, built around a delicate musical image. The 
"chords of memory" will eventually be "touched" by our better angels -- one can almost envision 
them plucking the strings of a harp -- and once those memories have been made vibrant, they will 
elicit other sympathetic vibrations, the intervals and overtones that energize and "swell the chorus 
of the Union."  These are "mystic" chords, which means that they must come from a divine, 
mysterious source; and these mystic chords somehow have the power to link "every battlefield and 
patriot grave" to "every living heart and hearthstone" in the land. When they are sounded, the 
mystic chords have the power to connect past and present, inner and outer, private and public, 
household and polity, locality and nationality in a single harmonious whole. During times of 
confusion and crisis, such as the nation was then facing, it could find composure and direction in 
recalling the Spirit of '76 and the Founders' heroic sacrifices. Citizens will draw strength and 
comfort from associating their love of the nation with the same warm devotion that attaches them to 
their own hearths.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;For Lincoln, though, the battlefields and patriot graves deserved our reverence not simply for 
sentimental reasons, or out of reverence for our ancestors' great sacrifices, but because of the cause 
for which they sacrificed. It would not have been enough had they merely died for the 19th-century 
equivalent of baseball, hot dogs, apple pie, and Chevrolet. They died, as Lincoln expressed it in the 
Gettysburg Address, in order that government of the people, by the people, and for the people "shall 
not perish from the earth."  They died, he asserted, to sustain the possibility of a nation "dedicated 
to the proposition that all men are created equal."  The mystic chords of memory, then, also draw us 
back to first principles and to an understanding of America as a nation self-consciously founded, at 
a distinct moment in time, with particular ends in view. From this perspective, the United States is a 
nation with a uniquely creedal sense of national identity -- a nation, as Chesterton put it, with the 
soul of a church. In this view, one becomes an American less by <i>descent</i> than by 
<i>consent</i>.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Thus, Lincoln's oratory offered two different effects of invoking the mystic chords of memory -- 
first, as reminders of an inherited way of life and, second, as reminders of a set of universal 
propositions. This duality is at the heart of a longstanding debate about the nature of American 
institutions, and indeed it now presents itself at the heart of contemporary debates about 
multiculturalism, immigration, and national identity. Is America a transnational nation, founded 
upon certain abstract and universalistic principles which it both exemplifies and promotes?  Or is it 
a civilization built upon a series of specifically Western European, and largely British, historical 
accretions with language, laws, customs, conventions, institutions, and belief systems arising 
organically out of those particular legacies?  Such questions are exceedingly difficult to answer 
with finality, and the balance between them may remain contested for as long as the United States 
stays in business as a country. It is hard to imagine either one of the perspectives they represent 
ever being excluded from our sense of national identity.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Now let me turn to the possibility of "reclaiming" the American past, alluded to in my subtitle. 
What is meant by this?  First, a recognition that genuine historical consciousness ought to be the 
common possession of all. Quite simply, a democratic nation needs a democratic history. By this I 
do not mean the sort of fashionable history that ignores politics and constitutions and intellectual 
elites and insists upon viewing the past exclusively "from the bottom up."  There is in fact a kind of 
unconscious scorn buried in the assumptions behind such writing -- as if political and intellectual 
history is beyond the common people's means, and as if no one could be expected to be interested 
in anything that does not involve them directly. Surely, however, such assumptions are false. 
Instead, we need to encourage serious historical writing that is sufficiently accessible to shape and 
deepen the public mind. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Here, too, one will need to battle on two fronts, challenging both the ignorance of the public and the 
malfeasances of the scholarly establishment. The American public has to want to reclaim its 
history, and it will have to be willing to work at it and overcome the tendencies so well illustrated 
by the rat joke. But that willingness will come far more easily if something can be done about the 
combination of political ideology and professionalization that has enveloped historical writing in 
recent years. The dangers of ideology are fairly obvious; but the dangers of exclusive 
professionalization are nearly as great. Though the professionalization of historical writing has been 
a source of many great improvements in our historical knowledge, it has wounded our historical 
consciousness. The time may have come to rethink the matter.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The recent dust-ups over the Enola Gay exhibit at the Smithsonian and the National History 
Standards are revealing in this respect. In both cases, the American public reacted decisively, and 
negatively, to what it saw as efforts by anointed experts to hijack the American past and transpose 
the mystic chords into a minor key. What has been most notable in both episodes has been the 
surprised and outraged reactions of the historical profession (or more precisely, of its spokesmen). 
The responses have run the gamut: astonishment, shock, fury, wounded dismay, dripping 
condescension. And I regret to say that even now I do not think my colleagues quite grasp what has 
happened to them. It has long been fashionable in academe to talk about who "owns" history and to 
make very democratic noises whenever the matter is under discussion. But all the while, it seems as 
if the professional historians have not doubted that <i>they</i> own it, or at least deserve to, and if 
one could take control of the American Historical Association and other professional organizations, 
one could transform history in a manner nearer to one's heart. They now have discovered that what 
flies in the hermetic world of academic scholarship will not fly with the great American public. In 
the Enola Gay episode in particular, the use of a public, and publicly funded, commemorative 
exhibition to put forward a revisionist interpretation of the American war effort in 1941-45 crossed 
a line, and the public would not tolerate it. And they were right not to.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Let me hasten to add that I am not saying history ought to be all comforting myth. Nor am I 
suggesting that historians should never challenge conventional wisdom. On the contrary; we badly 
need such challenges. But surely this does not mean historians enjoy <i>carte blanche</i> 
protection against being themselves challenged in turn, particularly when they choose to address 
sensitive public issues. Indeed, the public has a responsibility to offer such counterchallenges, 
whenever appropriate, to test and ventilate the findings of academicians. That is part of what it 
means to have a democratic history and democratic discourse. Yet it was precisely the mounting of 
such challenges that most offended the historical clerisy: The <i>effrontery</i> of all those World 
War II veterans, thinking they knew something important about the war that had escaped the 
attention of the Smithsonian's baby-boomer curators!  The future may well bring many, many more 
such acts of effrontery as the public's patience with the follies of higher education wanes -- and, 
may it be hoped, as their interest in reclaiming the past waxes.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It will, however, take more than challenging academic revisionism to accomplish much along these 
lines. The two fronts I spoke of before symbolize two problems that are, in fact, mutually 
reinforcing. Revisionism would have little power in a country that was less ignorant of its past. The 
docu-slanders of Oliver Stone would be laughed out of court. So would the childish fantasies of 
<i>Dances with Wolves</i>. Hence, in engaging the second front, we must resist the temptation to 
blame others, to play the game of anti-anti-Americanism, and instead face up to our weaknesses. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In this connection, it seems to me that Russell Kirk was right to stress that technological progress 
and the unhindered market are not the answer to everything. Notwithstanding their many blessings 
and benefits, one cannot ignore the pathologies and casualties they engender -- and the loss of 
historical consciousness has been one of them. We live in a culture of such ceaseless, turbulent 
change -- economic, social, technological -- that for many of us it seems almost ridiculous, and 
certainly quixotic, to be speaking of chains of continuity linking generations past with generations 
to come. Indeed, the emerging postmodern understanding of the self counsels that it is fruitless, and 
even unhealthy, to seek continuity and consistency within one's self. Better to be a protean self, 
hanging loose, refashioning one's identity as changing circumstances dictate. Postmodernism is 
itself symptomatic, the <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> of a pervasive tendency within our society. It 
may be crackpot realism of the worst sort to think we can go on this way very much longer, 
particularly if it is true that the social problem at the bottom of all others -- the disintegration of the 
family -- is ultimately a problem of discontinuity between the generations. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Our popular culture conspires in a thousand ways to reinforce our sense of discontinuity and 
generational isolation. Consider, to take but one example, what has happened to professional sports 
in our time. When I was a boy, professional sports formed a central part of my life. They provided a 
tremendous source of common experience linking me not only with my own friends, but with my 
father and mother and members of their generation. I had a typical American boy's fascination with 
baseball statistics and delighted in my then-extensive knowledge of them. I did not realize it at the 
time, but those statistics were also a source of historical consciousness. For to enter seriously into 
the world of baseball statistics is to become aware of a world much larger and longer than your 
own, to see all major-league baseball players competing in one great continuum of slugging 
percentages, earned-run averages, and stolen bases. One becomes a kind of historian. I learned to 
care not only about the active players I followed, like Boog Powell and Brooks Robinson, but about 
long-gone players my parents had followed, like Dizzy Dean, Stan Musial, Joe DiMaggio; and that 
was a wonderful bond between us. I will always have a soft spot for the St. Louis Cardinals, even 
though I grew up following the Baltimore Orioles, because the Cardinals had been my parents' team 
when they were young. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;I do not have any such soft spot, however, for the Indianapolis Colts. Nor do I expect to care much 
about the Baltimore Browns football team. When I was a boy, I was well aware that professional 
sports was a business. But I could never have imagined the degree to which it is now little else. We 
now have not only the free agency of players, but the free agency of franchises; and the rules, 
materials, schedules, game sites, players -- everything about the game -- are considered plastic and 
subject to revision. This is the triumph of utility-maximizing over all else, and I cannot help but 
think professional sports will ultimately be undone by it. In my own case, there is no magic left, 
and I am relieved that my own son has no interest in professional sports. Another chain of 
continuity broken.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Even so, there will always remain the irreducible lure of seeing excellence in performance, a 
healthy antidote to the cult of victimization and self-pity that has swept our culture. But one cannot 
feel that lure without first having a consciousness of the larger historical context which so engaged 
me as a boy, that universe of statistics and records. After Cal Ripken, Jr., broke Lou Gehrig's 
consecutive-game record this past year, he spoke some very simple but hauntingly appropriate 
words which captured this fact perfectly. As you may remember, there was some feeling that 
Ripken ought not break the record, that to do so robbed Gehrig of his distinction. But Ripken knew 
that the opposite was true: that he best honored Gehrig by competing with him. If Gehrig were 
looking down on this, Ripken said, he would not be thinking about the record; he would instead 
reflect that here was "an example of what is good and right about the great American game."  It was 
a simple, wonderful statement -- one that, in its own way, sounds the mystic chords of memory, 
stretching from every batter's box and bleacher seat to every hearth and TV room in this broad land. 
It recognizes that a determination to achieve and a reverence for the past are by no means opposites. 
But of course, Ripken would never have used the words he did had there not been so much that is 
neither good nor right about the great American game in its present condition.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;I have delved into the example of baseball, but I could have picked any number of features of our 
popular culture -- our popular music, our extreme geographical mobility, our disintegrating 
families, our declining churches and voluntary associations, our mania for the bulldozer and the 
wrecking ball. Indeed, I think there is a growing recognition of these problems across the 
intellectual spectrum. It is important, however, to formulate the problem rightly. It is not the 
<i>commodification</i> of all things (to use a trendy, overused word) but the <i>fungibility</i> of 
all things, which is to say their <i>impermanence</i>, that afflicts us -- the fungibility of 
marriages, lovers, jobs, habitations, even genders. It is not just that all things are for sale, but that in 
the process all things are being made commensurable and interchangeable, and therefore ultimately 
homogeneous. An odd goal for a world that professes to prize diversity but is in fact frightened by 
it. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;All of which should give added force in our minds to Kirk's permanent emphasis, in season and out 
of season, upon "the permanent things."  But it should also remind us that the recovery of historical 
consciousness is not merely an intellectual matter, a matter of rereading the great books and 
reemphasizing the roots of American order, as Kirk called them. It is also a very concrete matter, a 
matter of taking stock of the way we live, of what our pastimes and pleasures, our families and our 
marriages, our habits and our aspirations all say about our sense of connection to the past -- and, 
therefore, about ourselves. Karl Marx insisted that the past did not deserve our reverence; it was 
nothing but a snare. "The tradition of all the dead generations," he declaimed, "weighs like a 
nightmare on the brain of the living."  He was wrong about that, as about so much else. But too 
many of us live, whether we know it or not, as if we believed he was right. Perhaps it is time for 
that to change.

<TITLE>What Is The Third Generation? -- Heritage</TITLE>

<P>
<H2>Third Generation</H2>
<hr><p>

The term Third Generation describes a generation of conservatives whose primary purpose in Washington is to roll back the liberal policies of the last 60 years. First Generation conservatives were the intellectuals, including Russell Kirk, Bill Buckley, and James Burnham. Far removed from power, these intellects drew the philosophical map for later generations. 
<p>
The crushing defeat of Barry Goldwater in 1964 sparked the Second Generation of conservatives -- men and women dedicated to putting conservatives in office.  The Third Generation of conservatives emerged from Ronald Reagan's landslide victory in 1980.  Liberals, discredited intellectually by the First Generation, and defeated politically by the Second, were dismayed as swarms of young conservative activists came to Washington to chip away at their centralized power.
<p>
In January of 1984, The Heritage Foundation initiated the Third Generation project to identify young conservative leaders and bring them together in an informal setting to discuss the issues challenging them today and in the future.  Since then, Third Generation members have met every other Wednesday night for lectures and refreshments in Heritage's Lehrman Auditorium. 
<p>
While the initial goal of the Third Generation project was, and is, to identify and network young conservatives, its importance to the success of conservative policies runs much deeper. As a speaker said several years ago, "the central mission of the Third Generation is to continue to build the lines of communication between the various interests within our movement and develop a set of signals so that we can all move in one direction, to accomplish a common objective the rebuilding of America along the principles established by this country's founders."

<center><h2>HOLLYWOOD TV RATINGS TURN PARENTS<br>
INTO &quot;GARBAGE GOALIES&quot;</h2>

<p>

<h4>BAUER BLASTS VALENTI FOR &quot;MORAL POSTURING&quot; 
SAYS NEW SYSTEM WILL ENSURE THAT TV WILL &quot;PUMP MORE 
TRASH INTO AMERICA'S LIVING ROOM&quot;</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> The parental TV ratings system unveiled
Thursday by Motion Picture Association of America's President Jack Valenti
is &quot;an insult to parents everywhere, and a clear sign that
Hollywood has no intention of curbing sex, violence and foul language
on television,&quot; Gary Bauer, President of Family Research
Council said.  &quot;At best, this moral posturing promises no
changes in programming and turns parents into garbage goalies.

<p>

&quot;Mr. Valenti said that content-based ratings are impossible
because no one could distinguish hugs and kisses on <I>Dr. Quinn,
Medicine Woman</I> from Sharon Stone's sexual explicitness in
<I>Basic Instinct</I>.  And these are the people who will rate
the shows?  Somehow I have trouble working up a lot of faith in
this system.

<p>

&quot;Mr. Valenti offers lots of flowery rhetoric about parents'
concerns, but he never once has suggested that Hollywood should
curb the production of sex, violence and swearing that are common
during prime-time, even in the 'family hour,'&quot; Bauer said.
&quot;The net effect of this system will be to pump more smut
into America's family rooms.

<p>

&quot;I personally find the TV-14 rating the most revealing category.
Mr. Valenti said, 'We're ratcheting up now.'  I think he should
have said, 'We are ratcheting down -- toward the gutter.'  TV-14
says that programs suitable for 14-year-olds contain 'sophisticated
themes, sexual content, strong language and more intense violence.'
In their manufactured polls, I bet they didn't ask parents whether
they thought 14-year-olds ought to get a TV diet of sexual content,
foul language and 'more intense violence,'&quot; Bauer continued.
&quot;Even the TV-PG category shows Hollywood's true intent.
'Infrequent coarse language, limited violence, some suggestive
sexual dialogue and situations' are supposed to be suitable for
more children.  What planet is Mr. Valenti living on?  I'll tell
you -- Planet Hollywood.&quot;

<p>

Bauer called on Hollywood to &quot;quit hiding behind this phony
ratings ploy and pledge to clean up your act.  Be the good citizens
that you want parents to believe you are -- stop the trash, don't
just rate it.&quot;

<center><h2>PENTAGON DRAGS ITS FEET TO KEEP PORN<br>
IN MILITARY STORES</h2>

<p>

<h4>&quot;Military must show that it's serious
about sexual harassment and obey the new law banning porn sales,&quot;
Maginnis said</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council Military Readiness
Project Director Lt. Col. Robert Maginnis criticized the Pentagon
Wednesday for not following the law signed by President Clinton
three months ago banning &quot;the sale or rental of sexually
explicit written or videotaped material on property under the
jurisdiction of the Department of Defense.&quot;  Although the
law is scheduled to go into effect December 22, Maginnis said
&quot;the smut will likely remain on the shelves for now because
the Pentagon is more afraid of pornographers than Congress.&quot;

<p>

Claiming the ban will hurt porn sales, Bob Guccione, publisher
of <I>Penthouse</I> magazine, filed suit in New York asking for
an injunction to stop the Pentagon from removing his magazines
from military bookshelves.  Military lawyers' main objection to
the law is that it raises &quot;serious constitutional and administrative
problems,&quot; however Maginnis said the issue is not about constitutional
rights but about money.  Although customers pay less than the
market price for pornography in military stores, the Pentagon
earns over $4 million in annual sales.

<p>

&quot;The major constitutional obligation in this area is for
Congress to protect the military's combat fitness,&quot; Maginnis
said.  &quot;Congress has declared that selling pornography is
bad for readiness, and the military should obey.&quot;

<p>

Research shows that there is a direct association between exposure
to pornography and sexual misconduct.  The 1986 Attorney General's
Commission on Pornography cites studies which show that over half
of rapists say they were &quot;incited to commit an offense&quot;
by pornography and that 42 percent of child molesters &quot;implicated
pornography&quot; in their crimes.

<p>

&quot;The Pentagon must show that it is serious about sexual harassment
and military readiness,&quot; Maginnis said.  &quot;While Aberdeen
Proving Ground's sexual harassment hotline continues to ring off
the hook, pornography will remain on its shelves.  If the Pentagon
won't read the research, they must listen to female U.S. Army
officers based in Bosnia who complain about the 'rampant presence
of pornography, which is offensive to women, degrading to the
command atmosphere and encourages misconduct.'&quot;

<center><h2>TV RATING SYSTEM CALLED<br>
AN &quot;END-RUN AROUND PARENTS&quot;</h2>

<p>

<h3><i>Hollywood Looking for &quot;Excuse to Pollute,&quot; 
Bauer says</i></h3></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> The TV industry's proposed age-based rating
system is &quot;an excuse to pollute the airwaves,&quot; said
Gary L. Bauer, President of the Family Research Council on Wednesday,
one day before the industry prepares to release its ratings system.

<p>

Bauer made the following statement: &quot;Parents ought to be
able to tell whether a television program contains explicit sexual
scenes, vulgar language, violence and graphic murder portrayals,
or homosexual themes and references. What parent, in their right
mind, would accept a package at the front door labeled simply;
'Suitable for your 10-year-old,' and hand that package to their
child without checking further?  Parents need to know the contents
of the programming that Hollywood wants to give to our children.

<p>

&quot;What Hollywood thinks is acceptable is not the issue. The
entertainment industry should help parents make intelligent decisions
for their children with content-based ratings. Any claims that
more informative labels are not possible ring false when you consider
that many cable stations already provide information on program
content before a movie or show.

<p>

&quot;The age-based ratings constitute an end-run around parents,
who will be told that it is up to them to be monitors at all times
and in all places their child might be affected.  A similar system
was unveiled in 1965 for the movie industry, and it freed film
makers from any sense of responsibility.

<p>

&quot;You be the judge:  In 1965, <I>The Sound of Music</I> was
awarded the Oscar for Best Picture.  Four years later, the X-rated
<I>Midnight Cowboy</I>, about a bisexual hustler, won for Best
Picture.  Hollywood's attitude seems to be, as long as we rate
it, we can make anything we want and parents should shut up.

<p>

&quot;The new ratings system will perpetuate, not clean up, a
culture already soaked with sex, violence and foul language,&quot;
Bauer continued.  &quot;It's like setting a bunch of drunk drivers
loose on the streets while telling motorists that, in return,
they'll get upgraded bumpers and seat belts.  The industry needs
to clean up its act, period.  And content-based ratings could
help in that effort.&quot;

<center><h2>SUPREME COURT TO REVIEW COMPUTER PORN RULING</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> The Supreme Court announced Friday
that it will review the <i>Reno v. ACLU</i> decision to enjoin
the Communications Decency Act made earlier this year by a three-judge
panel in Philadelphia.

<p>

Family Research Council Director of Legal Studies Cathy Cleaver
said that the Department of Justice's appeal of the Philadelphia
ruling is the right thing to do, and that now the Supreme Court
has the opportunity to &quot;reverse the radical ruling which
gave Bob Guccione the right to give his <I>Penthouse</I> magazine
to our children on the Internet.&quot;

<p>

Cleaver continued, &quot;Laws against selling porn magazines to
kids are not unconstitutional.  Why should we have to tolerate
the same degrading images of women being given to those same kids
on-line?&quot;

<p>

Family Research Council presented a &quot;friend of the court&quot;
brief with the Philadelphia judges in <I>ACLU v. Reno</I> defending
the cyberporn provisions of the Communications Decency Act.  Cleaver
said the Philadelphia decision contradicts previous Supreme Court
decisions on the distribution of indecent material through the
media.

<p>

The Communications Decency Act:

<center><h2>Judge Chang Has &quot;Ravished the Rule of Law<br>
in Hawaii,&quot; FRC's Knight Says

<p>

Calls Marriage Ruling a &quot;slap in the face of Hawaiians<br>
-- and Americans everywhere,&quot; and Asks for Judge's<br>
Removal from Office</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;In striking down Hawaii's state
law that preserves marriage as the union of one man and one woman,
Judge Kevin Chang has ignored the wisdom of the ages, the will
of the Hawaiian people, and ample evidence of the state's compelling
interest in preserving this vital institution&quot; said Robert
Knight, Director of Cultural Studies for the Family Research Council.

<p>

&quot;His ruling legalizing the fiction of homosexual 'marriage'
essentially destroys the rule of law in Hawaii, and is a slap
in the face of  the Hawaiian people, who have made abundantly
clear their wish to resist judicial tampering with society's foundational
institution,&quot; Knight continued.  &quot;It is also a slap
in the face of the American people, who overwhelmingly support
marriage as a union reserved to one man and one woman.&quot;

<p>

Knight asserted that the Hawaiian Attorney General's office deliberately
underargued the case by &quot;ignoring a  mountain of evidence
that homosexuality is destructive to individuals, families and
society and that homosexuality is a changeable condition.

<p>

&quot;The state hung its case on a single factor -- the possible
effects on children -- which Judge Chang apparently has ignored,&quot;
Knight continued.  &quot;Concern for children, all by itself,
should have been enough reason for a sitting judge to uphold the
rule of law, of nature and of nature's God,&quot; Knight said.
&quot;No law that contradicts the fundamental moral law is legitimate.
This means that the court has now acted lawlessly, and the people
of Hawaii, who have spoken repeatedly and clearly about this issue,
would be well justified in seeking Judge Chang's removal from
the bench.

<p>

&quot;This decision underscores Congress' wisdom in enacting the
Defense of Marriage Act, which protects other states from the
Hawaiian courts' reckless activism.

<p>

&quot;It's time for Americans to examine and to exercise ways
to nullify the actions of judges who flout the law.  This is no
small legal matter but an assault on morality and the rule of
law itself.  Hawaiians can assist the entire nation by ending
the judicial arrogance that has precipitated this national threat
to marriage.&quot;

<center><h2>POLL FINDINGS ARGUE AGAINST NEW<br>
WELFARE ROLE FOR HILLARY</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</B> First Lady Hillary Clinton recently
touched off a firestorm (even within her own party) when she revealed
that she intends to take on a &quot;formal&quot; role on welfare
issues in the coming months.  Apparently, Mrs. Clinton envisions
leading an effort to reverse some of the key features of the welfare
reform legislation passed last year by the Congress and signed
by the President.

<p>

<b>But a new poll commissioned by the Family Research Council
finds that most Americans strongly support the new welfare bill
and do not want to see it reversed</b>. The survey, which was
conducted in November, 1996 by the Voter/Consumer Research polling
firm, found that only 12 percent of the 1,000 registered voters
surveyed felt that welfare reform &quot;has already gone too far.&quot;
Another 11 percent said that President Clinton and the Congress
&quot;have done enough&quot; to reform welfare, and a whopping
<b>72 percent said that the President and the Congress &quot;should
do more to reform welfare.&quot;</b>

<p>

In addition, another question in the FRC survey found Americans
quite unwilling to return to &quot;the era of big government.&quot;
When asked whether &quot;President Clinton and the Congress should
return to a greater role for the federal government in addressing
the country's domestic problems or should they continue cutting
back the size of the federal government,&quot; 62 percent called
for further cuts in government spending.  Only 26 percent supported
an increased federal role.

<p>

&quot;These poll findings make it clear that Hillary Clinton's
objectives on welfare are at odds with the will of most Americans,&quot;
FRC President Gary L. Bauer said today.  &quot;If the First Lady
wants to carry out the people's wishes on welfare reform, she
should be shouting, 'Charge!,' rather than 'Retreat.'&quot;

<center><h2>CENSUS STUDY PRESENTS MIXED PICTURE</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council Sr. Writer
for Cultural Renewal William Mattox on Tuesday called the results
of a new Census Bureau report on household and family characteristics
a &quot;mixed picture.&quot;  He said the new Census numbers show
that:

<p>

<li><b>Reports of the traditional family's death are greatly exaggerated.</b>
The report begins by asking, &quot;Are 'traditional' households
dead?;&quot; and then gives great attention to the fact that &quot;married,
with children&quot; families  now comprise only 25 percent of
all households.

<p>

But buried within the report is an acknowledgment that more than
half of all households are headed by a married-couple (some of
whom have yet to have children while others have already raised
children) and an acknowledgment that much of the growth of non-family
households is due to the rise in the number of elderly people
living alone after the death of their spouse.

<p>

Moreover, when one looks only at the universe of <I>families</I>
-- rather than all households -- more than three-fourths (77 percent)
of all families are headed by a married couple, and seven in ten
families with children are headed by a married couple.  Thus,
to a certain degree, the more things change, the more they remain
the same.

<p>

<li><b>The rise in single-parent households continues to be a cause
for concern.</b> While we should not overlook the prevalence
of married-couple families, neither should we ignore the significant
rise in single-parent households.  Clearly, the dramatic rise
in the number of single-parent households is the most disturbing
demographic change of the last 25 years.   While it is reassuring
to know that most families are still headed by a married couple,
the fact that single-parent households have nearly doubled in
number over the last quarter-century is a clear sign that all
is not well on the home front.

<p>

<li><b>The rise in unmarried households should not be a cause for
celebration.</b> Unlike the spin doctors in the Census Bureau's
public relations department, many Americans are troubled by the
rise in unmarried households.  Among those most likely to view
recent trends as a cause for concern are children being raised
without the benefit of two parents (a group we know to be growing
in size) and single women who would like to be married (a group
that appears to be growing in size -- if the fact that <I>The
Rules</I> stands atop the current best-seller list is any indication).

<center><h2>FRC TALKS TURKEY</h2>
<h3><i>OFFERS RESULTS OF RECENT POLL<br>
OUTLINING MENU FOR ACTION IN 105th CONGRESS</i></h3></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;Just as the Pilgrims and the
Native Americans learned to live harmoniously together, the American
people definitely want Congressional Republican leaders and the
Democratic President to work together in the coming year,&quot;
said Gary L. Bauer on Tuesday as Family Research Council released
its 1996 post-election poll.

<p>

But after being served bland mashed potatoes day after day for
most of the 1996 presidential campaign, Americans responding to
a recent Voter/Consumer Research poll commissioned by the Family
Research Council want to make sure the menu for action in the
105th Congress includes:

<p>

<h4>1. THE MAIN COURSE:</h4>

<p>

<li><b>A Pro-Family Tax Cut Big Enough to Put a Turkey in Every
Pot.</b> Seventy-two percent of the 1,000 Americans responding
to the FRC survey say they favor a cut in federal income taxes.
In the 104th Congress, the House and Senate passed (but President
Clinton vetoed) a tax cut bill which included a $500 per-child
tax credit.  When the 105th Congress convenes in January, this
pro-family tax measure should be at the top of the economic agenda.

<p>

<h4>2. THE TRIMMINGS:</h4>

<p>

<li><b>More Carrots for the States to Continue Welfare Reform.</b>
One of the major achievements of the 104th Congress was the passage
of a welfare reform bill which, among other things, offers states financial
incentives for lowering their out-of-wedlock birth rate.  When
asked about the welfare reform issue, 72 percent say President
Clinton and the Congress &quot;should do more to reform welfare,&quot;
11 percent say their elected officials in Washington &quot;have
done enough to reform welfare,&quot; and only 12 percent say that
&quot;welfare reform has already gone too far.&quot;

<p>

<li><b>Balanced-Budget Peas that Must Be Eaten.</b> Seventy-one
percent of Americans responding to the FRC poll say they &quot;strongly
favor&quot; balancing the budget.  Another 22 percent say they
&quot;somewhat favor&quot; this policy objective.

<p>

<li><b>Sweet Potatoes -- with No Artificial Sweeteners Added (Not
Even for Medicinal Purposes).</b> Seventy-one percent of the
public say they &quot;strongly favor&quot; increased federal efforts
to fight drug trafficking. Another 15 percent &quot;somewhat
favor&quot; this objective. Moreover, 71 percent say President
Clinton and his top officials have failed to pull their weight
in America's war on drugs. Only 24 percent say the Clinton adminstration
has &quot;been doing what could be expected.&quot;

<p>

<li><b>Educational Choice of Whole Apples, Cut Apples, Cooked Apples,
Applesauce, Apple Pie, Etc.</b> Seventy-one percent of the public
say they support education vouchers that would give &quot;parents
the ability to choose the private or public school their children
attend.&quot;  Apparently, this support is not only broad, but
is also quite deep -- two-thirds of those who favor school choice
say they do so &quot;strongly.&quot;

<p>

<li><b>Fat-Free Desserts (since the Era of Big Government Is Over).</b>
Sixty-two percent of the respondents say they believe
the President and the Congress should &quot;continue cutting back
the size of government.&quot;  Only 26 percent say they want their
elected officials to &quot;increase the federal government's role&quot;
in addressing American's domestic problems.

<p>

<h4>3. OTHER CONSIDERATIONS (Table Rules, Manners, etc.)</h4>

<p>

<li><b>Extra Seats at the Table for Babies Saved by Abortion Restrictions.</b>
Seventy-three percent of the respondents say they favor efforts
to require &quot;the consent of parents before a teenager is given
abortion counseling or referrals.&quot;  A similar majority (60
percent) express support for parental consent &quot;before teens
are given condoms, pills, or other forms of birth control.&quot;

<p>

<li><b>No Seconds (or Other Special Privileges) Until Everyone Is
Served.</b> More than four out of five Americans (83 percent)
say that gays and lesbians in the workplace should <i>not</i>
&quot;be given special protections, like those given to minorities
or the disabled.&quot;  Only 13 percent say they support measures
to extend job protections to gays and lesbians (like the legislation
Senator Ted Kennedy championed in the 104th Congress).  Moreover,
64 percent say they think the news and entertainment media devote
&quot;too much attention to homosexuality.&quot;  Only eight percent
say there is &quot;not enough&quot; coverage of these issues.

<p>

<li><b>A Prayer of Thanksgiving Acknowledging God's Providence.</b>
Nearly half of all Americans (44 percent) say the news and
entertainment media devote too little attention to the role of
religion in American life.  Thirty-seven percent say the amount
of media attention given religion is &quot;about right.&quot;
Only 14 percent say &quot;too much&quot; attention is devoted
to religion by the news media.

<p>

The Voter/Consumer Research survey for the Family Research Council
was conducted by telephone from November 6 through November 10,
1996, under the direction of FRC policy analyst Bill Mattox.
The sample of 1,000 registered voters was selected by using random-digit
dialing procedures.  The margin of error was roughly plus or minus
three percentage points.

<center><h2>BAUER ISSUES CHALLENGE TO GOP</h2></center>

<p>

<i>Gary L. Bauer, President of the Family Research Council and a 
Republican strategist challenged the Republican Party today to 
find its voice on values and to redirect its economic policy toward 
working class and middle class families. Here are some exerpts from 
his speech at the Heritage Foundation</i>.

<p>

"The great danger facing America is not from barbarians at the gates, 
but the sickness of our own hearts. What is at stake is whether this 
great experiment in ordered liberty under God can survive. That was 
the great issue that should have been central to the presidential 
election. Instead, in some bizarre role reversal, the party most 
associated with the permissiveness of the last thirty years constantly 
talked about values, while the party, <b>my</b> party, that counts on 
the votes of millions of Americans worried about our virtue deficit, 
instead seems obsessed with our wallets ...

<p>

"The warning signs of the failure of the 1996 campaign were these 
from the beginning. Our unelected party leadership was obsessed for 
the last four years with the mantra of 'big tent'. A big tent for 
what? To what end? To change America how? To improve the prospects 
for our families and children in what way? We can mock Bill Clinton's 
bridge to the 21st century, but it at least signals ideas. Big tent 
signals that when it comes to ideas we don't care enough to make a 
case for what we believe ...

<p>

"The key fact of the American economy is this: It is getting harder, 
not easier, for working families to make ends meet. Yet the elite of 
my party often seem not to recognize the problem. It isn't just a 
problem of slow economic growth. The real problem is that the take-home 
pay of workers has fallen behind the growth of the economy. They get to 
keep less and less of what they earn. Here's a stunning fact. We have 
created 10 million-plus new jobs, but only eight million more workers 
are now employed. Every three workers are holding down four jobs. One 
income used to provide for a family. Then it took two. Now, increasingly, 
it takes three! ...

<p>

"The days are over when a few Washington think tanks can be allowed 
to make elite economic policy for a party that is increasingly the 
party of small businesses, entrepreneurship, and Main Street. There 
is much to be done, from pro-family tax reform to placing entitlements 
on a sound footing. But the goals of these efforts can be summarized 
in a single phrase: we must be, we <b>will</b> be, for working families. 
We must support families that 'work' in that they are able to support 
themselves with the fruits of their labor ...

<p>

For way too long now both political parties have been guided by 
political consultants, pollsters and focus group gurus who substitute 
media manipulation for a governing philosophy. We need to look no further 
for the growing cynicism of the American people. I have little influence 
on the Democratic Party, so this advice will be to my fellow Republicans. 
Save your donors a lot of money by jettisoning the whole political clique 
of Washington manipulators. You don't need them to tell you what to 
believe. This is the party of Lincoln. Appeal to the better angels of 
the American people and trust them to respond as they always have when 
they hear the truth."

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br>

<p>

<center><h2>'A MISSION IMPOSSIBLE':<br>
MILITARY'S POLICY ON WOMEN IN COMBAT</h2></center>

<p>

<b>Washington, D.C. --</b> &quot;Sexual harassment and criminal
misconduct should be strongly condemned and the guilty must be
prosecuted.  But anyone who has worked with mixed gender settings
in a 24-hour per day, high stress and away-from-home environment
knows such settings are ripe for sexual improprieties even under
the best leaders,&quot; said Robert Maginnis, Director of Family
Research Council's Military Readiness Project, and retired military
on Thursday. &quot;But the result is a two-fold problem.&quot;

<p>

&quot;The first issue, and most important, is a moral one. The
incidence of outright coercion by officers against the women in
their command shows that character does matter. The breakdown
of values and lack of moral character are creating a debt that
men and women are paying and will pay well into the future. The
vulnerable become victims of the ruthless.

<p>

&quot;The Armed forces must make sure that those responsible for
misconduct receive swift and sure punishment. American parents
must be assured that their daughters who serve their country will
not be raped or forced into harmful, sexual situations.

<p>

&quot;The second issue is a different kind of problem -- that
of consensual sex within the military ranks. Because of the pressure
to ignore the differences between men and women in the name of
political correctness, we are creating a recipe for national disaster.
Our attempts to incorporate women are nothing like the successful
polices that integrated the races because the two issues are completely
different. With gender policies, problems will continue as long
as men and women are sexually attracted.

<p>

&quot;These radical changes came without Congress answering the
question, 'Does removing most exemptions for women promote military
readiness?' The answer for many commanders is no! We have created
sexually tense situations.

<p>

&quot;Consider this sad situation: Calls to Aberdeen's sexual
harassment center have exceeded 3,100 and involve all services
reaching back to World War II. So far, 341 cases are under
criminal investigation.

<p>

&quot;As planes begin to lift-off for Zaire for yet another deployment
of soldiers to primitive and wrenching places, <B>it's time to
rethink why we have saddled the military with a mission impossible</B>.
Sex happens when men and women stay long enough in forced intimate
situations. It happened in Haiti and Somalia, aboard dual gender
ships and in Bosnia. It will happen in Zaire, too. Sexual relationships
in units hurts effectiveness.

<p>

&quot;The goal of the military is to protect and defend the Unites
States of America. But social experiments are weakening the men
and women on whom we all depend. Those guilty of sexual impropriety
must be punished, and the status of  women in the Armed Services
must be reviewed to protect those who serve.&quot;

<center><h2>'96 ELECTION A WIN FOR CONSERVATIVES --<br>
REAL AND PRETEND, SAYS BAUER</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;Bill Clinton's
victory began when he recast himself as a pro-family conservative
and modeled Ronald Reagan's re-election campaign,&quot; Family
Research Council President Gary L. Bauer said Wednesday about
the election. &quot;As the President moved to the right, many
people were led to believe that his pro-family speeches meant
he had abandoned his liberal agenda. What we're more likely to
see is the same Bill Clinton of the last four years who will appoint
liberal judges, advance gay rights and insist on abortions even
in the ninth month of pregnancy.&quot;

<p>

Bauer continued: &quot;Once again, we see the winning formula.
Those candidates that support lower taxes, smaller government,
family values and respect for life get elected. Those who focus
on economics alone lose. Our hope is that the Republican leadership
finally understands this.

<p>

&quot;Throughout the campaign the true heart of the Republican
resurgence was evident in the conservative tone of the issues
supported and the race for the right. 'Liberal' was a dirty word
... even Bill Clinton took time on the stump to help redefine
Paul Wellstone as a conservative.

<p>

&quot;The big mistake the media and pundits make now is to ignore
the mandate the newly elected congress has to pursue principled
economic and family policy. Despite millions of dollars spent
by the labor unions and the Democratic Party, the vast majority
of the freshman House members survived -- strengthened by their
values.

<p>

&quot;This Congress has a mandate to act on behalf of the family
-- to support genuine family tax relief, to reenact the Partial
Birth Abortion Ban Act -- a critical issue that helped to bring
Ann Northup to the House -- and to act aggressively on the drug
problem that threatens our children. And since <I>everyone</I>
now claims to be a pro-family conservative, perhaps some of these
things can be achieved.&quot;

<center><h2>&quot;PORNOGRAPHY AWARENESS WEEK&quot;...<br>
BATTLING PORNOGRAPHY IN THE<br>
INFORMATION AGE</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;From protecting minors from on-line
pornography to eliminating the government's role as pornography
salesman, the 104th Congress took significant steps in waging
the ongoing war against pornography in the changing environment
of the Information Age,&quot; Family Research Council Director
of Legal Studies Cathy Cleaver said Thursday.  &quot;Celebrate
these victories during this year's <B>'Pornography Awareness Week'
(Oct. 27 - Nov. 1)</B>, but keep in mind that the cable and cyberporn
battle is far from over.&quot;

<p>

<h4>PROGRESS MADE....</h4>

<p><ul>

<li>Pro-family support made passage of the Communications Decency
Act (CDA) possible. With a strong provision to combat cyberporn,
the CDA prohibits adults from knowingly sending or displaying
indecent material to minors on the Internet.

<p>

<li>Additional protection for children came in the Child Pornography
Prevention Act of 1996.  It extends existing child pornography
restrictions to include any visual depiction that <I>appears to
be</I> a child engaging in sexually explicit conduct.  In other
words, it prohibits &quot;simulated&quot; pictures created by
computer programs, &quot;morphing&quot; images together, artistic
renderings which look like real children, and pictures of young
adults who are made to look like and are advertised as children.

<p>

<li>Congress also passed an amendment to the 1997 Defense Authorization
Act that prohibits the sale or rental of pornography by the government
anywhere on U.S. military property.

</ul><p>

<h4>THE ROAD AHEAD FOR CYBERPORN...</h4>

<p>

The Department of Justice
this month appealed to the Supreme Court a Philadelphia federal
court's ruling against the CDA. (<I>ACLU v. Reno</I>)  The court's
decision allows adults to knowingly send and display pornography
to minors on the Internet and maintains that it is &quot;either
technologically impossible or economically prohibitive&quot; for
pornographers to comply with the regulations. FRC filed a brief
defending the cyberporn provisions in the CDA and will continue
at the Supreme Court level to support ways to protect children
from on-line pornographers.

<p>

Cleaver said, <b>&quot;Cyberspace is our children's new playground,
and it is a world where pornography knows no bounds.  Failure
to defend strong laws would be like leaving a loaded gun in that
playground.  Families report that this is a serious problem, and
the burden of protecting children from exploitation should not
rest solely on them.&quot;</b>

<center><h2>SUPREME COURT &quot;KNOWS A SOLID RULING<br>
WHEN IT SEES ONE,&quot; FRC SAYS

<p>

FRC COMMENDS COURT'S DECISION TO<br>
UPHOLD LAW EXCLUDING HOMOSEXUALS<br>
FROM MILITARY SERVICE</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council commended the
Supreme Court's decision Monday to turn down a challenge to the
law excluding homosexuals from military service in <I>Thomasson
v. Perry</I>.  &quot;The Court knows a solid ruling when it sees
one,&quot; FRC Attorney Melissa Wells-Petry said Monday. &quot;Military
people support the ban and so do the American people.&quot;

<p>

FRC was given the rare opportunity to present oral arguments in
this case before the Fourth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals.  Wells-Petry,
a former Army lawyer who has defended the military's ban on homosexuals
for years, submitted friend-of-the-court arguments to the effect
that the dismissal from the Navy of Lt. Paul G. Thomasson, a self-identified
homosexual, should be upheld.

<p>

&quot;The Fourth Circuit not only upheld the law excluding homosexuals
from military service,&quot; Wells-Petry continued, &quot;it also
made hash of the Administration's regulations implemented to enact
the law.&quot;

<p>

Technically, FRC and the Clinton Justice Department were on the
same side of this case, however their arguments differed greatly.
The Justice Department opposed FRC's arguments, which were based
on the intent of the law passed by Congress rather than on the
often contradictory directives prepared by the Administration
to implement the law.  The Justice Department also submitted a
brief opposing FRC's participation.  The Justice Department rested
their case, as their brief stated, on the &quot;paramount interest
in defending the validity of Directives&quot; issued to implement
the law.

<p>

&quot;Friends of the armed forces are pleased the Court let this
excellent ruling stand,&quot; Wells-Petry said.

<center><h2>&quot;ONCE GAY, ALWAYS GAY&quot; NOT TRUE,<br>
LOVE OFFERS REAL HOPE, KNIGHT SAYS</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;For too long, many people have
come to believe that people with homosexual desires cannot change. <b>The
'once gay, always gay' fiction has persuaded more than a few Americans
to support so-called 'gay rights' out of a misdirected sense of
compassion.</b> But it is anything but compassionate to tell
someone they have no hope of change and that they might as well
indulge in sexual behavior that is unhealthy, immoral and in many
cases, even fatal,&quot; Bob Knight said Thursday during a ground
breaking news conference.

<p>

Knight, Family Research Council Director of Cultural Studies,
participated in a 9:30 a.m. news event to unveil PFOX -- Parents
and Friends of Ex-Gays (Contact: Anthony Falzarano) -- a new,
national parents group that will counter the pro-homosexual PFLAG. The
news event, which included former homosexuals and lesbians, also
highlighted the Second Annual National Coming OUT OF Homosexuality
Day. (Contact: Michael Johnston)

<p>

Knight made the following comments during the news event at the
<b>National Press Club</b>:

<p>

&quot;Over on the mall this week, the AIDS quilt is a silent and
wrenching testimony to the hundreds of thousands of people struck
down with premature death.  The quilt also symbolizes tragic choices
made by many people who were misled into believing they had no
other option.  How many of these sons, daughters, fathers, brothers
or sisters would be alive today if they had had access to compassionate
people like these around me who have been caught up in sexual
or drug addiction but have broken the deadly pattern?

<p>

&quot;Today's message is very simple:  No one has to be 'gay.'
No one should reject a family member because that family member
is 'gay.' But love does not require accepting behavior that is
harmful. In fact, real love in action is a conscious effort to
steer someone away from behavior that can hurt or even kill. 
It isn't always easy, but it can be done, as evidenced by the
many who have.

<p>

&quot;Parents, Family and Friends of Ex-Gays (PFOX), which is
being introduced today, has been formed to aid people who have
family members struggling with homosexuality.  PFOX is dedicated
to correcting the many distortions and increasingly abusive assertions
made by homosexual activist groups against those with whom they
disagree. The homosexual activist movement despises and attacks
the ex-gay movement out of fear that these people are exactly
who they say they are: people once in bondage to homosexuality
but now freed to pursue a fuller life. But their lives are evidence
of options rarely discussed but very real.&quot;

<p>

<i><b>NOTE: From 10-11 a.m. on Friday, Oct. 11, former homosexuals
and lesbians will join together for a time of testimonials, sharing
and outreach on the West Front of the Capitol. Their efforts are
timed to coincide with the AIDS Quilt.  All are welcome.</b></i>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Timed in conjunction with National
Coming Out Day, which is organized to affirm the homosexual lifestyle,
a Thursday news conference will focus on the other options and
organizations that are available to help people struggling with
homosexuality.

<p>

National organizer Michael Johnston, a former homosexual who is
HIV-positive, has joined with more than 100  local and national
organizations to coordinate the second annual &quot;National Coming
Out of Homosexuality Day.&quot; Coming Out of Homosexuality Day
is a project organized to counter the events of the Human Rights
Campaign, which works to further the agenda of homosexual activists.

<p>

<b>The news event, co-sponsored by Family Research Council,  will
be at: 9:30 a.m. Thursday, Oct. 10, in the Zenger Room of the
National Press Club.</b>

<p>

The news event will include the exciting unveiling of a parents
and friends organization -- PFOX, Parents and Friends of Ex-Gays,
an outgrowth of  D.C.- based Transformation Ministries. PFOX was
organized to provide family viewpoints ignored by PFLAG, the pro-homosexual
parents organization.

<p>

<b>On Friday, Oct. 11, National Coming Out of Homosexuality Day
organizers will also host a time of testimonials, sharing and
outreach from 10 a.m. to 11 a.m. The media are welcome to talk
with former homosexuals at this event geared for reaching out
to practicing homosexuals about their other options. The location:
TBA, but it will be organized around the AIDS quilt activities.</b>

<center><h2>ASSISTED SUICIDE CASES DRAW<br>
ATTENTION OF PRO-FAMILY GROUPS</h2>

<p>

<h3><i>Stop the &quot;cheapening of human life,&quot; Cleaver 
says</i></h3></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> The Supreme Court Tuesday announced
its decision to review two recent U.S. federal court cases on
assisted suicide.  The Ninth Circuit in <I>Glucksberg v. Washington</I> 
struck down a Washington statute prohibiting doctors from
prescribing lethal &quot;medication&quot; as violative of the
Constitution's liberty interest, using reasoning identical to
the Supreme Court abortion cases.  <I>Quill v. Vacco</I> from
the Second Circuit concluded that New York's anti-assisted suicide
violated the Equal Protection Clause on the ground that there
is no difference between &quot;allowing nature to take its course&quot;
and intentionally causing death.  Family Research Council is preparing
<I>amicus</I> briefs on these cases for the Supreme Court, urging
the Court to reverse the decisions from Washington and New York.

<p>

Director of Legal Studies Cathy Cleaver said, <b>&quot;It is a
tragic irony that our country is moving to a place where we prohibit
only the killing of the healthy and strong, while we sanction
the killing of the frailest members of our own families: our
unborn children and elderly parents and grandparents.&quot;</b>

<p>

Cleaver cited a recent report produced at the request of Congressman
Charles Canady on euthanasia in the Netherlands:  &quot;The <B>Netherlands
Report</B> presents some alarming facts,&quot; Cleaver said. 
&quot;In 1990 alone, 2,300 people were killed by Netherlands doctors
in its euthanasia program.  While this is certainly tragic, what
is more shocking is that, in the same year, more than 1,000 people
were <I>euthanized without their consent</I>; 140 of these cases
involved a fully competent person who was never given a choice.&quot;
<B>Euthanasia perverts and demeans the health profession by not
giving doctors the tools of life but rather putting in their hands
the instruments of death.</B>

<p>

Cleaver continued, &quot;The cheapening of human life which was
begun with the sanctioning of killing of our unborn children must
not be expanded to include the elderly or disabled who may be
the weakest and most needy among us.  The persons most likely
to be pressured into assisted suicide are the very people who
need us most to help them rise above depression and illness. 
A truly compassionate society will offer assistance and hope to
its citizens in need; relegating them to the morgue is the height
of utilitarian arrogance and greed.&quot;

<center><h2>DON'T FUND DR. DEATH, FRC SAYS</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council commended Friday
the efforts of Rep. Charles Canady in the production of the Congressional
Report on Assisted Suicide in the Netherlands.  FRC Director of
Legal Studies Cathy Cleaver said Friday she believes the report
is an important contribution to the debate concerning physician
assisted suicide and euthanasia in America.

<p>

<b>Cleaver said, &quot;It is a tragic irony that our country is
moving to a place where we prohibit only the killing of the healthy
and strong, while we sanction the killing of the frailest members
of our own families:  our unborn children and elderly parents
and grandparents. Euthanasia perverts and demeans the
health profession by not giving doctors the tools of life but
rather putting in their hands the instruments of death.&quot;</b>

<p>

FRC also praised the efforts of Senators John Ashcroft and Byron
Dorgan to prohibit federal funding for assisted suicide.  Already
in Oregon, the director of Medicaid has announced his intention
to use federal funds for assisted suicide.

<p>

&quot;The <b>Netherlands Report</b> presents some alarming facts,&quot;
Cleaver said.  &quot;In 1990 alone, 2,300 people were killed by
Netherlands doctors in its euthanasia program.  While this is
certainly tragic, what is more shocking is that, in the same year,
more than 1,000 people were <I>euthanized without their consent</I>;
140 of these cases involved a fully competent person who was never
given a choice.&quot;

<p>

This October, the Supreme Court is likely to announce its decisions
regarding review of two recent U.S. federal court cases on assisted
suicide.  The Ninth Circuit in <I>Glucksberg v. Washington</I> struck
down a Washington statute prohibiting doctors from prescribing
lethal &quot;medication&quot; as violative of the Constitution's
liberty interest, using reasoning identical to the Supreme Court
abortion cases.  <I>Quill v. Vacco</I> from the Second Circuit
concluded that New York's anti-assisted suicide violated the Equal
Protection Clause on the ground that there is no difference between
&quot;allowing nature to take its course&quot; and intentionally
causing death.  Family Research Council is preparing <I>amicus</I> 
briefs on these cases for the Supreme Court.

<p>

Cleaver continued, &quot;The cheapening of human life which was
begun with the sanctioning of killing of our unborn children must
not be expanded to include the elderly or disabled who may be
the weakest and most needy among us.  The persons most likely
to be pressured into assisted suicide are the very people who
need us most to help them rise above depression and illness. 
A truly compassionate society will offer assistance and hope to
its citizens in need; relegating them to the morgue is the height
of utilitarian arrogance and greed.&quot;

<center><h2>DEATH SENTENCE FOR UNBORN IS STAIN ON<br>
THE LAND OF THE FREE, HOME OF THE BRAVE</h2>

<p>

<h3><i>THIS ISSUE WILL NOT GO AWAY, BAUER SAYS</i></h3></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;This tragic vote, condemning
the lives of thousands of our children, will not be the end of
debate over Partial Birth Abortion. The President and those who
stood with him should be ashamed for blinding themselves to tragic
deaths in an attempt to win political points,&quot; Family Research
Council President Gary L. Bauer said Thursday after the Senate
voted 57 to 41 -- 8 votes short of those needed to overturn Bill
Clinton's veto.

<p>

&quot;The only pain Bill Clinton seems to feel is his own. This
vote is about the kind of 'choice' people make when they see others
dying on a roadside. Some stop to help. Others keep walking. It
is inhumane to know how children are being killed as they pass
through the birth canal -- and do nothing.

<p>

&quot;Partial Birth Abortion is the sleeper issue of 1996. It
is a measure of the kind of people we are.

<p>

&quot;This vote will not rest easy on the conscience of the American
people. This is a nation built on the idea that all people are
created equal. This will stick in their throats. We are a better
country than one that takes the lives of defenseless children
in this way.&quot;

<p>

Earlier today Gary Bauer stood with many distinguished senators
and a dozen of pro-family, pro-life, and religious leaders, including
Dr. James Dobson, in the office of Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott to denounce partial-birth abortion and to call on the Senate
to override President Clinton's veto of the Partial-Birth Abortion
Ban Act.

<center><h2>ENOUGH BLAME, TIME FOR ACTION IN<br>
WAR ON DRUGS,<br>
FRC SAYS</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, DC --</b> &quot;It's time to wake up and admit that
we have a major crisis on our hands,&quot; FRC Senior Policy Analyst
Bob Maginnis said Thursday. &quot;For the second time in a month,
new statistics have been released showing a dramatic increase
in the number of teens who use drugs.&quot;

<p>

According to a study released Wednesday by the National Parents'
Resource Institute for Drug Education (PRIDE), the number of teens
in grades six through twelve using illicit drugs on a daily basis
increased 147 percent in the past decade.

<p>

These latest findings, along with the results of the Columbia
University study released in August, are a cause of great concern
to parents, teachers and politicians alike.  A joint Congressional
hearing Thursday will look into the causes of the recent jump
in teenage drug use.

<p>

&quot;The current Administration has virtually ignored the fact
that anti-drug abuse campaigns like former First Lady Nancy Reagan's
'Just Say No' program work,&quot; Maginnis said, &quot;There is
a definite correlation between the absence of such high-profile
nationalized efforts and the recent rise in drug use among teens.&quot;

<p>

&quot;It's time to stop complaining and get to work,&quot; Maginnis
explained. &quot;We've dropped the ball on the drug issue.  All
the evidence says the same thing, 'Talk to your kids about drugs.
Make them aware of the real dangers surrounding drug abuse, and
they will be less likely to experience firsthand the pain of addiction.'
We also need to reconsider a balanced interdiction and demand
reduction policy.&quot;

<p>

Maginnis returned last week from Zurich, Switzerland where he
addressed the Association for the Advancement of Psychological
Understanding of Human Nature and several other international
organizations on the topic of teen drug abuse in the U.S.

<center><h2>SLEEPER ISSUE OF 1996 WAKING UP<br>
PRO-FAMILY MAJORITY, BAUER SAYS</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;Americans of many faiths stand
here today in unity because of the horrifying reality of Partial
Birth Abortion,&quot; <b>Family Research Council President Gary
L. Bauer</b> said Thursday morning, before the anticipated Senate
veto override vote. &quot;In recent days, liberals and conservatives,
Democrats and Republicans and those who worship in many ways have
joined their voices to speak for those children killed as they
pass through the birth canal.&quot;

<p>

Bauer made the following statement from the U.S. Capitol with
leaders from the Protestant, Catholic and Jewish communities.
The news conference followed an ecumenical prayer breakfast for
our nation's children and the partial birth abortion vote.

<p>

<b>&quot;However this vote goes, this will not rest easy on the
conscience of the American people. This is a nation built on the
idea that all  people are created equal. This will stick in their
throats. We are a better country than one that takes the lives
of defenseless children in this way. The President should be ashamed.

<p>

&quot;Partial Birth Abortion is the sleeper issue of 1996</b>.
It has proved a powerful rallying cry for many Americans. And
as it is described, more and more people recoil in horror from
what really happens to thousands of our children.

<p>

&quot;It is an issue that is waking up a pro-family majority.
And it is an issue that illustrates just how radical Bill Clinton's
abortion position is. <b>Apparently, he does not feel the pain
of healthy children</b> killed moments from birth. <b>Apparently
he does not feel the pain of children who may have handicaps to
overcome</b>, but have a world of love to offer.

<p>

&quot;We Americans have to choose what kind of people we will
be. This 'choice' screams of injustice.&quot;

<p>

<center><h2>REAGAN-PROCLAIMED &quot;RELIGIOUS<br>
FREEDOM WEEK&quot; SIGNIFIES BATTLE FAR<br>
FROM OVER FOR PEOPLE OF FAITH,<br>
FRC SAYS</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council announced this
week its support for &quot;Religious Freedom Week,&quot; beginning
Sept. 23.  Proclaimed in 1988 by President Ronald Reagan, Religious
Freedom Week began because &quot;(t)he American people have long
recognized that the liberty we cherish must include the freedom
to worship God as each of us pleases.&quot;

<p>

In celebrating Religious Freedom Week, FRC, whose motto is &quot;Defending
Family, Faith, and Freedom,&quot; joins hundreds of pro-family
organizations and religious institutions to acknowledge the importance
of faith and religious freedom in our country.

<p>

In believing that our Founding Fathers did not intend to establish
the principle of &quot;freedom <I>from</I> religion&quot; but
rather &quot;freedom <I>of</I> religion, &quot; FRC policy and
legal analysts have worked for years on ways to promote and protect
the freedoms people of faith enjoy in this country.

<p>

FRC President Gary Bauer has taken the issue of religious freedom
to Capitol Hill on numerous occasions testifying before Congress
on a proposed Religious Liberty Amendment and on the world-wide
persecution of Christians.

<p>

The rising occurrence of church burnings and of religious persecution
both in schools and in the workplace reveals the need for continued
efforts to restore the original intent of our Founding Fathers
in the Constitution.  As President Reagan noted, the First Amendment
&quot;is the protection of religion and conscience from government
interference.  It creates neither hostility between government
and religion nor a civil religion of secularism.&quot;

<p>

Plans have already begun to build greater awareness for Religious
Freedom Week in 1997. FRC policy analysts and government affairs
office have also begun developing policy initiatives and legislative
strategies to protect religious liberty in the 105th Congress.

<center><h2>PARTIAL BIRTH ABORTION:<br>
'THE SLEEPER ISSUE OF 1996'</h2>

<p>

<h3>Bauer commends House;<br>
calls on Senate to overturn Clinton veto</h3></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;Partial birth abortion is the
sleeper issue of 1996,&quot; Family Research Council President
Gary L. Bauer said Thursday. As the House voted 285 to 137 to
overturn President Bill Clinton's veto of legislation to ban a
horrific procedure used in the late stages of pregnancy, Bauer
made the following comments.

<p>

&quot;The fact that the late-term abortion technique called Partial
Birth Abortion even exists shows just how terrible is the slippery
slope message that children should be 'planned and wanted' before
having value. Americans on both sides of the life debate have
joined together to say that this cruel procedure goes too far.

<p>

&quot;The Clinton administration has presented us with tremendous
irony this week in their defense of Partial Birth Abortions and
their aggressive support of abortion-causing drugs, called RU-486,
and then their surprise at the increase in child abuse. When the
political elite use the bully pulpit to argue that life has no
value unless it's healthy, planned and desired, society's weakest
members become vulnerable.

<p>

&quot;Family Research Council commends the House for their courage
in highlighting a procedure so terrible, it could not be used
on animals ... and should not be used for our unborn. And we call
on the Senate to join their collegues from both sides of the aisle
to overturn Clinton's veto of the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act.&quot;

<center><h4>** MEDIA ADVISORY **</h4>

<p>

<h2>HOUSE TO VOTE ON PARTIAL-BIRTH<br>
ABORTION OVERRIDE THURSDAY</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> On the day of the vote to override
President Clinton's veto on the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act
(H.R.1833) in the U.S. House of Representatives, Family Research
Council Director of Communications Kristi Hamrick said, &quot;By
telling people that only 'planned and wanted' children have value,
we have opened a deadly Pandora's box for our most helpless members
of society.

<p>

&quot;This week in the news, we see the Clinton administration
pushing chemical abortions, talking about partial-birth abortions
and then commenting on an increase in child abuse. But it is no
surprise to pro-family Americans that children are being injured
as we communicate the message that children are not a blessing,
but an option or a problem.  We must talk about all children --
born and unborn -- as valuable and worthy of our sacrifices for
them. Pro-family America calls on all members of Congress to override
the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act veto. We must act today to
support all our children.&quot;

<p>

The House will begin one hour of debate at 10:30 a.m. Thursday
morning followed by a vote.

<p>

<center><h4>What Experts are Saying About Partial-Birth 
Abortions</h4></center>

<p>

&quot;I believe that Mr. Clinton was misled by his medical advisors
on what is fact and what is fiction in reference to late-term
abortions.  Because in no way can I twist my mind to see that
the late-term abortions as described -- you know, partial-birth,
and then destruction of the unborn child before the head is born
-- is a medical necessity for the mother.  It certainly can't
be a necessity for the baby.  So I am opposed to ... partial birth
abortions.&quot;

<p>

-- <i>World-renowned pediatric surgeon and former Surgeon General
C. Everett Koop, in an August 19, 1996 interview with <U>American
Medical News</U>, &quot;The view from Mount Koop,&quot; p.3.</i>

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

&quot;Pro-choice activists categorically insist that only 500
of the 1.5 million abortions performed each year in this country
involve the partial-birth method, in which a live fetus is pulled
part way into the birth canal before it is aborted ... But interviews
with physicians who use the method reveal that in New Jersey alone,
at least 1,500 partial-birth abortions are performed each year
-- three times the supposed national rate.  Moreover, doctors
say only a 'minuscule amount' are for medical reasons.&quot;

<p>

-- <i>&quot;The facts on partial-birth abortion,&quot; by Ruth
Padawer, <U>The Sunday Record</U> (Bergen County, NJ), September
15, 1996.</i>

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

&quot;Congress, the public -- but most importantly women -- need
to know that partial-birth abortion is never medically indicated
to protect a mother's health or her future fertility.  On the
contrary, this procedure -- which has never been evaluated in
mainstream, peer reviewed literature -- can pose a significant
threat to both her immediate health and future fertility...  We,
and many other doctors across the United States, regularly treat
women whose unborn children suffer these and other serious conditions.
Never is the partial-birth procedure medically indicated.  Rather,
such infants are regularly and safely delivered live, vaginally,
with no threat to the mother's health or fertility.  Sometimes,
as with hydrocephalus, it is first necessary to drain some of
the fluid from the baby's head.  And in some cases, a cesarean
section is indicated.  In no case is it medically necessary to
partly deliver the child vaginally, and then terminate his or
her life before completing the delivery.&quot;

of more than 230 physicians, mostly professors and other specialists
in obstetrics, gynecology, and fetal medicine.</i>

<center><h2>RU-486: IT'S NO MIRACLE CURE</h2>

<p>

<h4>&quot;WHERE ARE THE GUARDIANS OF WOMEN'S HEALTH?&quot; HSU 
ASKS</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;The Food and Drug Administration
has a responsibility to ensure the safety and effectiveness of
any drug that would be marketed for U.S. consumption. <b>But
with this rushed acceptance of RU-486, the FDA has clearly shown
that those safeguards can be ignored for political purposes</b>,&quot;
Family Research Council analyst Gracie Hsu said Wednesday as the
news broke of the conditional approval of the abortion-causing
drug regimen.

<p>

&quot;The Clinton Administration threw its political weight behind
pushing this abortion-causing drug past the safeguards that protect
American women. But this interference was not to save women's
lives. It wasn't for a breast cancer treatment or even for experimental
drugs for life-threatening diseases like AIDS.  It was simply
to approve a drug whose sole purpose is to end the life of a child,&quot;
Hsu said.

<p>

<center><h3><u>QUESTIONS THAT NEED TO BE ANSWERED:</u></h3>

<p>

<h4>HOW WILL RU-486 AFFECT WOMEN'S HEALTH?</h4></center>

<p>

During the U.S. clinical trials earlier this year, four women
required blood transfusions because they lost so much blood, 15
women required surgery, 21 required hospitalization, 13 percent
required treatment for bleeding, and five percent of all the women
in the study required narcotics for the pain.  All of these side
effects happened in spite of the fact that the women who participated
in the clinical trials were highly motivated, closely monitored,
and underwent follow-up.  We can expect that women will suffer
results far worse than these when RU-486 becomes available to
all U.S. women without the ideal conditions associated with clinical
trials.

<p>

Furthermore, the FDA has still failed to answer pressing questions
regarding how RU-486 will affect women's health.  For example,
if the drug fails to result in a complete abortion -- whether due
to drug inefficacy or failure of the woman to comply with protocol -- the
medical complications could be severe, i.e., infection,
sterility, or giving birth to a deformed baby.  There is also
a dangerous void of research about the long-term effects of RU-486
on women, including the future fertility of women, the possible
link with breast cancer, and the medical complications resulting
from the drug's accumulation in the body.

<p>

Beyond these issues of physical health, RU-486 will also negatively
impact women's emotional and psychological health.  The numbers
of women suffering from post-abortion trauma are already reaching
a critical mass, and we can expect these numbers to dramatically
increase with the introduction of RU-486.  This is because RU-486
requires women not only to take the abortion drug with their own
hand, but also to bear the psychological trauma of viewing their
unborn children after the &quot;products of conception&quot; are
passed.

<p>

<center><h4>WHO WILL BE RESPONSIBLE IF WOMEN BLEED TO DEATH?</h4></center>

<p>

The Clinton administration partnered with an abortion advocacy
organization, the Population Council, to bring RU-486 to the United
States. The drug manufacturers did not advocate or advance this.
Therefore, who will be legally responsible for what happens to
women?  Will women who are harmed by the drug have recourse to
sue?  Will the American taxpayers foot the bill for any problems
since this administration pushed the drugs even without the corroboration
of a drug manufacturer?

<p>

<center><h4>*Most asked media question*<br>
WHERE WILL THE PRO-LIFE MOVEMENT GO IF THERE ARE NO
PRAYERFUL PROTEST SPOTS?</h4></center>

<p>

The pro-life community is hardly confined to abortion clinics.
Rather, the pro-life movement is composed of concerned citizens
all across the United States who believe that human life is valuable
at all stages of life, from the moment of conception to the time
of natural death.  While some in the pro-life community choose
to peacefully protest abortion by praying in front of abortion
clinics, the pro-life community is widely represented by its compassion
for women in crisis pregnancies.  Crisis pregnancy centers provide
pregnant women with hope in the form of financial, material, and
emotional support.  These pregnancy care centers also provide
loving counsel for those women who suffer from post-abortion trauma.
Furthermore, adoption agencies provide women with a way to give
their children the gift of a family.  These ministries to women
will not change, but the pro-life community is saddened that the
approval of RU-486 will only cause more women to seek their services
as more women face the tragedy of post-abortion trauma.

<center><h2>FRC EQUIPS <i>MOMS AND DADS</i> WITH<br>
<i>SCHOOL SURVIVAL GUIDE</i>, A TOOL FOR<br>
KEEPING PARENTS AWARE AND<br>
INVOLVED</h2>

<p>

<h4>&quot;WHAT A DIFFERENCE A PARENT MAKES,&quot; BAUER SAYS</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council released Tuesday
the 1996 <I>Moms and Dads School Survival Guide</I>, a 64-page
resource to help parents stay informed and involved in their children's
educational process.

<p>

&quot;Parents today are spending too much time combating condoms,
offensive curriculum, and failed federal programs,&quot; FRC President
Gary Bauer said upon the release of the <I>Survival Guide</I>.
&quot;While test scores plummet, horror stories about flagrant
breaches of parental rights are coming to us from around the country.&quot;
Here are some of the stories:

<p><ul>

<li>On March 19, 1996, 59 sixth-grade girls in East Stroudsburg,
Pennsylvania, were required to submit to a genital examination
as part of a &quot;routine&quot; physical.  Without parental consent,
the school conducted the exams blocking the exit door and refusing
to allow the crying and pleading young girls to call their parents.

<p>

<li>Psychological testing under the guise of standardized testing
includes intrusive questions about the child's emotional state
and his relationship with his parents.  For example, a 149-question
survey used in Minnesota public schools without parental approval
contains questions such as:  Have you ever tried to kill yourself?
How often have you run away from home?  Have you felt so discouraged
or hopeless that you wondered if anything was worthwhile?

<p>

<li>In Stephens County, Georgia, parents were shocked to discover
that their 14- and 15-year-old daughters had been driven to a
birth control clinic by a public school staffer without their
knowledge.  The county clinic dispensed birth control pills and
condoms to the girls and administered Pap smears and AIDS tests.
The parents were then denied access to the test results by the
school, which defended its actions on the grounds that the counselor
believed she was doing what was best for the girls.

</ul><p>

Author and FRC Education Policy Analyst Jennifer A. Marshall said
the <I>Moms and Dads School Survival Guide</I> was designed to
help parents not only know their rights in these situations but
also how to prevent them from happening in the future.

<p>

&quot;Families need not simply survive school,&quot; Marshall
said. &quot;They should be free to thrive and excel in any environment
- public, private, or home-based education.  Parents playing an
active role makes all the difference in children's educational
attainment.  They are the key to everyday school survival, and
we need to equip them to do the job they do best.&quot;

<p>

The <I>Survival Guide</I> is a detailed look at educational issues
facing all parents, whether they help with homework or homeschool.
The guide defines education jargon, like &quot;outcome-based
education,&quot; &quot;one-stop shopping center,&quot; and &quot;vouchers&quot;;
it explains students' religious liberties in the public school;
and it details what parental rights are and how parents can defend
them.  The <I>Guide</I> also introduces parents to the variety
of educational options available to them, including classical
and parent-based education.  Extensive reference lists place key
resources, from newsletters to on-line information, at parents
fingertips.

<p>

&quot;Parents are looking for alternatives and answers every day,&quot;
Marshall said. &quot;By getting information into the hands of
each parent, this guide is a simple, yet powerful way to restore
parents to their proper place at the helm of their child's educational
journey.&quot;

<center><h2>FRC SUPPORTS BILL TO ELIMINATE<br>
GOALS 2000</h2>

<p>

<h4>&quot;This long overdue legislation will send federal
tax dollars back where they are needed the most -- in the hands
of the parents and teachers who can best decide how to use them,&quot;
Marshall says.</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, DC --</b> Family Research Council supported the
&quot;Goals 2000 Elimination Act&quot; introduced by Rep. Lindsey
Graham (R-SC) at a news conference on Capitol Hill Wednesday.

<p>

&quot;This legislation repeals the federal Goals 2000 program
and sends its funding back where it belongs,&quot; FRC policy
analyst Jennifer A. Marshall said, &quot;to the local school boards,
elected by parents and community members, who have the authority
to make decisions for their own schools.&quot;

<p>

&quot;Goals 2000 snatched local authority and put it in the federal
government's hands.  Under Goals 2000, state and local school
districts must spend their money according to Washington's bureaucratic
priorities, not their local needs,&quot; Marshall said.

<p>

&quot;Take a closer look at Goals 2000 and you'll see that it's
not about the 3 R's.  Read the eight national education goals
and objectives, and you'll find Goals 2000 talking about enhanced
prenatal health care, comprehensive sex education and requirements
for American businesses with regard to education.  The program
isn't about education -- it's about using our schools to forward
a broad, liberal social agenda,&quot; Marshall explained.

<p>

&quot;We all know that education in America is suffering,&quot;
Marshall says, &quot;but Goals 2000 is not the solution.  Enhanced
social services -- including school-based health care and sex
education beginning as early as kindergarten -- can't solve the
fundamental crisis our schools.  A return to what schools <I>ought</I>
to do best -- teaching the academic basics like reading, writing
and arithmetic -- is the right answer.

<p>

&quot;FRC applauds Rep. Graham's commitment to the family and
to education as demonstrated by the Goals 2000 Elimination Act.&quot;

<p>

<center><h2>&quot;AMERICA DODGES THE BULLET,&quot;<br>
BAUER SAYS OF ENDA DEFEAT</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;America has dodged the bullet,&quot;
Family Research Council President Gary Bauer said of the Senate's
narrow (49-50) defeat of the so-called Employment Non-Discrimination
Act (ENDA).

<p>

&quot;For the U.S. Senate to come within one vote of enshrining
homosexuality along with race, sex and ethnicity in our nation's
civil rights laws represents a disconnect from reality.

<p>

&quot;Many ENDA supporters equated homosexuality with being black
or Hispanic. But minority groups that enjoy special protections
do so because of group histories of political powerlessness, economic
deprivation and unchangeable characteristics.  Homosexuals do
not qualify in any of these categories.

<p>

&quot;This was a homosexual jobs bill, pure and simple. It would
have forced employers to keep detailed records of the private
sexual preferences of their employees. How bizarre that the defenders
of <I>the constitutional right of privacy</I> were prepared to
annihilate privacy in the service of the homosexual agenda.

<p>

&quot;ENDA would have led, inexorably, to quotas and set-asides.
All the most divisive social conflicts in America today would
have been inflamed by the passage of this ill-advised legislation.
Can nearly half of our senators really want that?  Supporters
of  ENDA shrewdly used paper exemptions for churches and synagogues
to create a facade of deference to the religious community.  But,
make no mistake, this bill would have been used as a sledgehammer
to smash faith-based, for-profit institutions -- like religious
broadcasters, like religious publishing houses and bookstores,
like summer camps for religious youth.

<p>

&quot;Passage of ENDA would have signaled the contempt of Senate
liberals for the legitimate rights of the states, one-third of
which still list sodomy as a crime. Worst of all, ENDA would have
encouraged more young people to enter an immoral and unhealthy
lifestyle. Society cannot be indifferent to the signals -- subtle
and not-so-subtle -- that it sends its youth. ENDA would have meant
that the U.S. government doesn't care whether young people who
are struggling with their sexual identity resolve to live normal,
heterosexual lives or not.

<p>

&quot;But this <I>is</I> a day to savor victory. It is sweet because
it was so hard won. The overwhelming vote of the Senate (85-14)
in favor of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA)
sends a clear message that this basic institution is valued and
will be fought for. No one can take seriously the argument that
it is beneath the dignity of the Senate to debate the survival
of marriage. Failure to pass DOMA would have exposed the entire
federal union -- <I>all</I> the states, <I>all</I> branches of the
federal government -- to the dangers of an imperial judiciary. With
this stunning vote, the Supreme Court of Hawaii has all the justification
it needs to <I>reject</I> gay marriage. Let's put this bad idea
to rest now -- and forever. President Clinton should now eat his
spinach and sign DOMA immediately.&quot;

<center><h2>SENATE'S PASSAGE OF DOMA IS<br>
&quot;A VOTE FOR COMMON SENSE,&quot; BAUER SAYS</h2>

<p>

<h4>Calls on President to &quot;eat your spinach<br>
and sign the Defense of Marriage Act&quot;</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council President Gary Bauer
hailed the overwhelming vote of 85 to 14 by the U.S. Senate to
pass the Defense of Marriage Act, which puts the bill on President
Clinton's desk.

<p>

&quot;Now that Congress has done its job and passed this wise
and needed legislation, we are saying to the President, 'eat your
spinach and sign the Defense of Marriage Act as you promised.'&quot;
Bauer said. &quot;Given the gravity of the judicial challenge
in Hawaii, it is imperative that DOMA become the law of the land
as soon as possible so that the states won't be forced to accept
counterfeit 'marriage' should the Hawaiian courts take the radical
step of destroying the traditional definition.

<p>

&quot;It is amazing that we even had to fight a battle to ensure
that marriage remained the legal union of a man and a woman,&quot;
Bauer continued. &quot;But it was also heartening that so many
people around the nation rallied to defend this irreplaceable
institution.  The huge margin of victory was won by millions of
people who let their representatives know how they felt.&quot;

<p>

&quot;We commend Sen. Nickles and Reps. Bob Barr and Steve Largent
for their leadership in bringing the Defense of Marriage Act to
passage.

<p>

&quot;Failure to pass DOMA would have jeopardized the moral foundation
upon which the rest of society is built,&quot; Bauer continued.
&quot;Marriage has already suffered a loss of respect thanks
to the sexual revolution.  Many people are struggling with broken
families and are trying to put their lives back together.  Many
have prevailed over difficult circumstances and sought a better
life for their own families.  But society must never deliberately
raise the bar higher for the next generation of children. They
deserve the marriage-based blessings that previous generations
have enjoyed.

<p>

&quot;America's commitment to marriage has been strengthened by
this Act.&quot;

<center><h2>ENDA WOULD USHER IN NATIONAL<br>
HOMOSEXUAL AGENDA, KNIGHT SAYS</h2>

<p>

<h4>&QUOT;'GAY JOBS BILL' THREATENS FREEDOMS OF RELIGION,<br>
CONSCIENCE, ASSOCIATION AND SPEECH&QUOT;</h4></center>

<p>

&quot;The Employment Non-Discrimination Act (HR 1863; S972) is
a radical change in workplace discrimination law,&quot; said Robert
Knight, Family Research Council's Director of Cultural Studies.
This legislation, sponsored by Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-MA), is
currently under consideration in the Senate and could be voted
on at any time.

<p>

&quot;What is being described as a harmless gesture of 'tolerance'
toward homosexuals in the workplace is actually a mighty weapon
to be used against both employers and employees who believe that
homosexuality is wrong.  This 'gay jobs bill' threatens the freedoms
of religion, conscience, association and speech,&quot; Knight
said.  &quot;ENDA puts children's camps, Christian- and Jewish-owned
businesses, and many other institutions in the crosshairs of homosexual
activist lawyers.  At its root,&quot; Knight noted, &quot;ENDA
would distort the concept of civil rights by creating an unprecedented
behavioral component whose outer limits cannot even be imagined.

<p>

&quot;The so-called 'religious exemption' in Kennedy's amendment
is so narrow that it will leave millions of devoutly religious
Americans exposed to the heavy hand of big government.  ENDA's
sweeping protection based on &quot;sexual orientation&quot; eliminates
any legitimate questions as to appropriateness of sexual behavior,&quot;
Knight said.  &quot;ENDA guarantees an onslaught of costly litigation
which could hurt small businesses most of all.

<p>

&quot;ENDA paves the way for quotas based on sexual preference,
regardless of a provision that stipulates that no quotas are allowed;
(remember Hubert Humphrey's promise in 1964 that the Civil Rights
Act would never lead to quotas?); prohibits employers from disciplining
or taking into account in any way sexual activity <b>on or off
the job</b> by an employee (the term &quot;sexual orientation&quot;
is infinitely expandable); defines &quot;sexual orientation&quot;
so broadly that all sexual proclivities, from pedophilia to bisexuality,
are given special protection and therefore moral status on a par
with sex within marriage; and suggests the federal government
is officially supportive of sexual promiscuity, since bisexuals
by definition have sex with more than one person.

<p>

&quot;People want homosexuals to have the same rights -- not more
rights -- in the workplace as anyone else,&quot; Knight said.  &quot;The
federal government has no business ordering millions of Americans
to accommodate behavior that they believe is wrong and destructive.&quot;

SURRENDER&quot;</i></h2>

<p>

<h4>Available NOW along with other policy works
on the growing drug problem in America.</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;The policy debate over the drug
problem has radically changed from one that tried to find effective
ways of keeping our children from drugs to 'harm reduction' strategies
which facilitate 'safer' drug use ... and you can see the result
of that seriously flawed switch,&quot; said Robert L. Maginnis,
drug policy analyst for the Family Research Council. The policy
expert made his comments as more evidence was unveiled this week
on the growing drug crisis in America.

<p>

&quot;Illicit drugs kill 20,000 Americans every year,&quot; Maginnis
noted. &quot;We must get serious about the life and death struggle
that casual attitudes toward drug use ignore.&quot;

WEEK:</h4>

<p>
<li>Pro-life candidates win all three primaries -- Georgia, Kansas
and Michigan.

<p>

<li>These included:

<p><ul>

-- the fight for Dole's senate seat<br>
-- the Speaker's home state<br>
-- the state of a governor who has been on the short list of
Vice Presidential candidates

</ul><p>

<li><I>New York Times'</I> polling shows what Gary Bauer has said
all along, the people making up the GOP delegation are primarily
pro-life.

<p>

<li>To the contrary of what pro-abortion Republicans have said,
the platform remains a document that reflects the majority view
of the GOP -- that life is an important issue.

<p>

<li>Gary Bauer continues to be a champion in the fight for life,
meeting with the majority of the delegation repeatedly during
these days to find reasonable ground.

<center><h2>DO YOUR KIDS INFLUENCE YOUR VOTE?<br>
FAMILY RESEARCH COUNCIL SAYS<br>
TRACK THE &quot;PARENT GAP&quot;</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON --</b> In the last presidential election, the &quot;Parent
Gap&quot; proved to be far bigger than the &quot;Gender Gap,&quot;
as voters with children in the home showed less support for Clinton
than childless voters or empty nesters.  In fact, &quot;the demographic
peers of George Bush and Ross Perot were more responsible for
the election of Bill Clinton and Albert Gore than any other age
group,&quot; noted Family Research Council Vice President for
Policy Bill Mattox.

<p>

Mattox made his observations in &quot;The Silent Minority -- The
Hidden Electoral Impact of Children&quot; based on original, scientific
polling FRC commissioned after the last presidential election.

<p>

On Wednesday, Mattox noted that the research tracks with current
polling which underscores that <i>marriage and property ownership
are good indicators</i> of whether someone votes conservatively.

<p>

&quot;<i>But tracking marriage alone is not enough</i>. The presence
of children in the home is sometimes even more important than
marital status,&quot; Mattox said.

<p>

<b>In the last election, &quot;none of the standard demographic
variables -- gender, income, ethnicity, religion, age, marital
status, or education -- was as reliable in predicting whether
or not someone voted for Clinton as the presence of children in
the home,&quot; Mattox reported.</b>

<p>

In fact, the presence of children in the home is a good indicator
of conservative leanings as a whole and a heightened interest
in &quot;values&quot; issues specifically, Mattox said.

<center><h2>FDA SHOULD NOT APPROVE RU-486 DUE TO<br>
ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS, FRC SAYS</h2>

<p>

<h4>&quot;The federal government should not promote a drug whose 
sole purpose is to destroy human life,&quot; Policy Analyst Gracie 
Hsu says.</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;Indeed, we would all be outraged 
if the federal government ever issued an approval of Dr. Kevorkian's 
killing machine simply because he claims there are 'therapeutic' 
effects for his patient,&quot; Family Research Council Policy Analyst 
Gracie Hsu said Thursday.  &quot;We know otherwise.  In the same way, 
the federal government should not give its imprimatur to RU-486 
because no government should ever be responsible for the killing 
of innocent human beings or an accomplice to the mothers who would 
take the lives of their own children.&quot;

<p>

Hsu made her statement as Family Research Council and the National 
Right to Life Committee co-sponsored a news conference on the 
medical risks and legal implications of RU-486.   The news conference 
was held one day before a hearing by the Reproductive Health Drugs 
Advisory Committee of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to 
consider whether the abortion drug RU-486 should be recommended for 
use in the United States. Hsu is scheduled to testify before the 
Advisory Committee Friday.

<p>

&quot;It is unacceptable for the federal government, through the 
vehicle of the FDA, to promote a drug whose sole purpose is to 
destroy the life of another human being.  There are no therapeutic 
effects of RU-486,&quot; Hsu said.

<p>

&quot;Furthermore, the FDA has an ethical duty not to approve a 
drug that would be harmful to the mothers taking the drug.  We 
already know that at least one woman in Iowa lost so much blood 
as a result of taking RU-486 that she almost died.  And there are 
other issues regarding the abortion drug's safety and efficacy.  
For example, if the drug fails to result in a complete abortion -- 
whether due to drug inefficacy or failure of the woman to comply to 
protocol -- the medical complications could be severe, i.e., 
infection, sterility, or giving birth to a deformed baby.  There 
is also a dangerous void of research about the long-term effects 
of RU-486 on women, including the future fertility of the women, 
the possible link with breast cancer, and the medical complications 
resulting from the drug's accumulation in the body.

<p>

&quot;The FDA has heretofore compromised its objectivity and ethical 
standards because FDA Commissioner David Kessler promised that he 
would place RU-486 on a fast track and approve the drug within six 
months.  FRC calls on the FDA to halt its attempt to circumvent its 
own approval statutes to ensure safe and effective drugs for the 
sake of the lives and safety of both women and children.&quot;

<p>

<center><h2>FAMILY RESEARCH COUNCIL PULLS OUT<br>
OF &quot;STACKED&quot; HEARING UNDER STRONG<br>
PROTEST</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;Ordinarily, we are honored to
be invited to testify at a congressional hearing, but we won't
allow ourselves to be used as a fig leaf for a propaganda party
on a homosexual 'civil rights' bill,&quot; said  Robert H. Knight,
Director of Cultural Studies for the Family Research Council.
&quot;It is obvious that they are staging this stacked hearing
now to try to cripple final passage of the Defense of Marriage
Act.&quot;

<p>

Knight had been slated to testify on July 17, 1996 before the
Government Programs Subcommittee of the House Small Business Committee,
chaired by Rep. Peter Torkildsen (R-MA).  The topic was to be
the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) (HR 1863) which would
give homosexuals special rights in the workplace that other employees
do not enjoy.

<p>

Knight, who had testified in 1994 before the U.S. Senate Judiciary
Committee on an earlier version of the bill, canceled after learning
the lineup of witnesses.  The July 17 hearing lineup consisted
of three panels, with 10 of 12 people speaking for ENDA.

<p>

The first panel was slated to be of five businesspeople, all of
whom were supporters of ENDA.  The second panel was to consist
entirely of purported &quot;victims&quot; of discrimination because
of their sexual orientation.  No speakers were invited who had
suffered at the hands of homosexual activists wielding 
&quot;anti-discrimination&quot; charges. No former homosexuals were 
invited to counter the faulty research that has been publicized on 
causes of homosexuality.

<p>

The final panel was to have included Family Research Council and
a spokeswoman from the Small Business Survival Committee, along
with two pro-homosexual witnesses.

<p>

Both Family Research Council and Small Business Survival Committee
pulled out of the hearing, citing similar reasons:  the hearing
was a stacked showcase for ENDA, and not enough notice was given
to attain more witnesses to provide balance.  The Small Business
Survival Committee representative also said she had a prior commitment.

<p>

&quot;Torkildsen's Massachusetts colleague, Sen. Ted Kennedy,
has announced his intention to attach ENDA to DOMA when the bill
is considered in the Senate.  Since this addition would be unacceptable,
it is clearly an attempt to kill DOMA,&quot; Knight said.

<p>

&quot;ENDA is being raised at this time not on its own merits
but as a vehicle that they hope will derail the Defense of Marriage
Act (DOMA) which passed the House on a vote of 342-67,&quot; Knight
said.  &quot;Why would anyone who supports DOMA want to be a party
to this charade?&quot;

<p>

&quot;President Clinton has said he <I>would sign it in its current
form</I>. Any effort to tamper with the language might jeopardize
final passage of the bill,&quot; Knight said.

<p>

Family Research Council had urged the Chairman's staff to contact
several other potential witnesses, including Anthony Falzarano,
Director of Transformation Ex-Gay Ministries in Washington, D.C.;
Seattle businessman Bryan Griggs, who was forced to defend himself
against a false charge of discrimination by a homosexual employee,
and Joseph Broadus, a George Mason University law professor and
expert in civil rights law.  Falzarano was never contacted; Broadus
was unable to be reached, and Griggs received a call at about
3:30 p.m. Washington time the day before the hearing, after Family
Research Council and Small Business Survival Committee had pulled
out under protest.  Statements from Broadus, Falzarano and Griggs
are available from Family Research Council.

<p>

&quot;The timing of the hearing and the lack of balance constitute
a naked attempt to use ENDA as a way to harm passage of DOMA,
and Family Research Council will not be used as a pawn in this
cynical game,&quot; Knight said.

<center><h4><i>** MEDIA ADVISORY **</i></h4>

<p>

<h2>RU 486: SUNNY RHETORIC OR BLOODY REALITY?</h2></center>

<p>

On <b>Thursday, July 18</b>, one day before the FDA Advisory Board
hearing to review the application to market the RU 486 abortion
technique in the United States, Family Research Council and a
number of national pro-life groups will hold a news briefing to
highlight the viewpoints of medical and legal experts on the dangerous
aspects of RU 486.

<p>

<center>The news conference will be held:<br>
<b>Thursday, July 18, 1996<br>
10:00 a.m.<br>
First Amendment Room, National Press Club</b></center>

<p>

This highly controversial drug has been put on the fast track.
Reports claim that the American trials have had no serious problems,
however there are many crucial questions that remain unanswered.
In fact, one doctor's patient was close to death after having
an RU 486 abortion.  Dr. Mark Louviere, an Iowa physician who
supports legalized abortion, will speak Thursday about his experience
administering the drug to a patient who lost more than half of
her blood volume after taking RU 486.

<p>

Other doctors and an attorney will address the many risks and
complications of RU 486, including: the psychological trauma,
safety and liability issues, and the problems with the approval
process.  For example, five Committee members and the executive
secretary of the Advisory Committee may have a conflict of interest
and bias in favor of abortion.

<p>

Family Research Council Policy Analyst <b>Gracie Hsu</b> will
testify Friday before the Advisory Committee for Reproductive
Health Drugs and will be present at the news conference for interviews.

<center><h2>FAMILIES SALUTE CONGRESS ON DEFENSE<br>
OF MARRIAGE VOTE</h2>

<p>

<h4>&quot;It is not intolerance to believe in traditional morality,&quot; 
Bauer says.</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;<b>Defending normalcy is not
an intolerant act.</b> It is not intolerance to believe in traditional
morality. The vast majority of Americans, from Hawaii -- where
this attack on marriage originates -- to the other 49 states,
all agree that marriage is the bringing together of the two sexes.
Family Research Council applauds this historic affirmation of
marriage,&quot; Family Research Council President Gary L. Bauer
said Friday.

<p>

Bauer made the following statement after the House voted 342 to
67 to pass the Defense of Marriage Act, which would define marriage
as the union of a man and woman in federal law and would allow
states to refuse to recognize same sex unions as marriage.

<p>

Bauer said: &quot;<b>We commend those pro-family champions who
voted today to protect marriage</b> from the aggressive legal
actions of homosexual activists and the ambitions of liberal judges.
The House made an important first step in defending marriage from
its attackers. <b>Family Research Council calls on the Senate
to also support the foundational, fundamental union of marriage
when the bill reaches it shortly. And FRC calls on the Senate
to reject diversionary efforts -- as the House did -- to alter
the bill.

<p>

&quot;Often I am asked, what does it matter if two men or two
women down the street want to call what they have 'marriage'?
Why does it hurt you or your marriage? Well it doesn't -- unless
they bring the law into it.</b> Then the fiction is imposed on
everyone and the counterfeit will do great harm to the special
status that genuine institution has earned. The force of law would
come against businesses, school and all institutions -- such as
the Boy Scouts -- that do not embrace homosexuality as a good
and normal behavior.

<p>

&quot;There are many relationships in which love is involved.
But marriage is a unique bonding of the two sexes, with the probable
expectation of procreation of children. It is the core of civilization
and is universally honored.

<p>

&quot;Good men and women of varying beliefs have been subjected
to a barrage of name-calling and abuse for simply saying that
marriage ought to be the union of a man and a woman and that the
law should protect this vital social norm. <b>It is not hatred
to prefer normalcy</b>.&quot;

<p>

On <B>Thursday, July 11</B> at <B>10:00 AM</B>, Family

&quot;This is by far one of the most crucial pieces
of legislation ever to be voted on in Congress,&quot; Bauer said

<center><h2>SUPREME COURT DECISION FREES CABLE<br>
OPERATORS TO REFUSE PORNOGRAPHIC<br>
PROGRAMS</h2>

<p>

<h4>&quot;Major Court victory will allow local cable companies
to protect our children from pornography,&quot; Cleaver
says.</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> American families fighting to shelter
young children from cable television pornography won a major battle
today as the Supreme Court upheld the right of private cable operators
to screen pornographic programs from their leased access channels
in its <I>Denver Area Educational Telecommunications Consortium,
Inc. v. FCC</I> decision. &quot;This is a major victory for parents,
children and the First Amendment alike,&quot; says Cathy Cleaver,
Director of Legal Studies for the Family Research Council.

<p>

&quot;The Court's reaffirmation of the indecency standard as a
check to determine which material is suitable for children is
significant,&quot; Cleaver continued. A June 12th federal district
court decision in Philadelphia ruled that the definition of indecency
as &quot;patently offensive communication, taken in context, which
describes or depicts sexual or excretory activities or organs,
as measured by contemporary community standards&quot; is too vague
as it applies to the Communications Decency Act (CDA) which sought
to protect children from indecent material on the Internet.  According
to Cleaver, &quot;This latest decision greatly increases the likelihood
of a reversal of the Philadelphia decision when it is heard by
the Supreme Court.&quot;

<p>

In today's decision, the Court upheld the First Amendment rights
of cable operators by giving back to them the editorial power
to decide what programming they <I>do not</I> want to transmit.
However, the Court struck down provisions that <I>required</I>
cable operators to &quot;segregate and to block&quot; transmission
of sexual programs which they <I>choose</I> to show.  The Court
did not free cable operators to refuse pornographic programs on
public, educational or governmental channels because &quot;cable
operators have not historically exercised editorial control&quot;
over such channels.

<p>

&quot;The Court has done its part by giving cable operators the
ability to refuse pornographic programming,&quot; Cleaver said.
&quot;Now it is time for citizens to hold cable operators accountable
to the community.  Anyone who is concerned with this issue should
contact their local cable company and let them know, in no uncertain
terms, that pornography -- on any channel -- is simply unacceptable.&quot;

<center><h2>CLINTON ADMINISTRATION TREADS<br>
ON RELIGIOUS, CIVIL RIGHTS<br>
OF CATHOLICS IN THE MILITARY</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;President Bill Clinton's administration
has gagged Catholic chaplains in the military,&quot; Family Research
Council President Gary L. Bauer noted on Friday.

<p>

In response to a massive post card mailing from the National Conference
of Catholic Bishops calling upon the Congress to ensure the acceptance
of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, HR 1833, Clinton's appointees
in the Pentagon moved to silence Catholic chaplains. An order
was sent from the Pentagon to the military chaplains not to participate
in the post card mailing.

<p>

&quot;Catholic service members and their families will thus be
denied the guidance of their priests and their bishops. They will
also be prevented from participating in an effort to communicate
to the Congress their own strongly held beliefs on one of the
premier moral issues of our day,&quot; Bauer said.

<p>

Bauer said he deplored the Clinton administration action. &quot;This
is denial of the religious and civil rights of Catholic Americans
serving in the military. Every day, these loyal Americans put
their lives on the line to defend our liberties. They deserve
respect, not abuse.&quot;

<p>

Bauer noted Clinton administration claims that the pro-life post
card campaign constitutes &quot;partisan political activity.&quot;
But this claim is belied by the fact that the Partial-Birth Abortion
Ban was passed by overwhelmingly bi-partisan majorities in both
houses. Among the supporters in the House were such leading Democrats
as Minority Leader Dick Gephardt (Mo.), Minority Whip David Bonior
(Mich.) and freshman Patrick Kennedy (R.I.).  In the Senate, respected
senior Democrat, Daniel Patrick Moynihan (N.Y.) vowed to support
the override of Clinton's April 10 veto.  &quot;It's just too
close to infanticide,&quot;  Moynihan said.

<p>

&quot;Family Research Council endorses the efforts of the National
Conference of Catholic Bishops to communicate with their co-religionists
in the armed forces,&quot; Bauer said. &quot;We will stand beside
our friends in defense of children threatened by this hideous
and painful method of abortion.&quot;

<center><h2>ON THE &quot;MORNING-AFTER PILL&quot;:<br>
FRC TO FDA: VOTE NO ON RELABELING,<br>
IT'S NEITHER &quot;EMERGENCY&quot; NOR<br>
&quot;CONTRACEPTION&quot;</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council Director of
Communications Kristi Hamrick on Friday urged the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) to reject relabeling of oral contraceptives
to include abortion-causing uses.

<p>

Mrs. Hamrick said: &quot;Although proponents of the 'morning-after
pill' like to call it 'emergency contraception,' the effect of
relabeling oral birth control pills for post-coital use would
make the pills neither 'emergency' nor 'contraception.'  Indeed,
we can expect that, if relabeling occurs, girls and women may
forgo other forms of birth control and simply choose to consume
larger dosages of the pill after sex.  And, the major function
of the pill when used after sex, if conception has occurred, would
not be 'contraception' (preventing fertilization) but 'abortion'
(preventing implantation of a living human being).

<p>

&quot;On the societal level, the 'morning-after pill' further
distances the act of sex from the physical consequence of pregnancy
and especially from its proper context within marriage.  Therefore,
it would be much harder to send a message of responsible sexual
behavior, especially to young men and women, when the immediate
potential effect of pregnancy is removed.  But even without pregnancy,
sex has consequences -- both physical and emotional.  Without
the fear of pregnancy, some might mistakenly presume that it is
'safe' to engage in sex, and therefore, initiate sex earlier or
engage in sex more frequently with multiple partners.  However,
these behaviors significantly increase the risk of sexually-transmitted
diseases and infertility.  On the emotional level, more often
than not, it is the woman who gets hurt by these noncommittal
liaisons.

<p>

&quot;Furthermore, a 'morning-after' remedy would give men 'a
way out' from assuming responsibility for their sexual behavior,
shifting the power balance even more in favor of men.  The real
result of this overdose of birth control pills would be to cut
more of the moral ground out from under women who are trying to
make good choices for their lives.

<p>

&quot;Why should the FDA be so interested in relabeling oral contraceptives
when the drug manufacturers haven't petitioned for the change?
Currently, consumers can hold their physician liable if a drug
used for off-label purposes results in adverse health consequences.
Relabeling may protect physicians from liabilitiy, but it hardly
helps their patients, especially when long-term physical and social
consequences have not been carefully examined.&quot;

<p>

<i>Mrs. Hamrick made her statements on the eve of the FDA Reproductive
Health Drugs Advisory Committee hearing set for Friday</i> in
Maryland.  The continued push for relabeling comes from liberal
feminist and pro-abortion groups such as Planned Parenthood, the
Center for Reproductive Law &amp; Policy and the American Medical
Women's Association which filed a citizen's petition to force
the issue.

<p>

<b>An FDA decision to relabel oral contraceptives for use as a
&quot;morning-after pill&quot; would be troubling for several
reasons:</b>

<p>

(1) If the girl/woman did indeed become pregnant (post-fertilization),
the morning-after pill <i>would work, except in rare cases, as
an <b>abortifacient</b></i>, thickening the uterine lining to
prevent implantation.  The embryonic human being has already been
alive and growing for about a week, and since human life begins
at the moment of conception, preventing implantation is not 
&quot;contraception,&quot; it is &quot;abortion&quot; and should be 
treated as such.

<p>

(2) Furthermore, there are <i><b>serious potential risks</b></i>
to the women taking the &quot;morning-after pills.&quot;  For
example, it is quite likely that FDA approval of post-coital use
would cause women to change their behavior and use &quot;contraception&quot;
only after sex rather than the currently specified daily dosage
at a particular time.  The effect of consuming larger dosages
of birth control pills frequently is not known. <i>There are
apt to be <b>side effects</b></i>, potentially on future fertility,
possibly producing birth defects in surviving children, certainly
on the woman's immediate health, for it would compound the discomfort
of the regular-dosage &quot;pill&quot; -- nausea, bleeding, etc.

<p>

(3) These &quot;morning-after pills&quot; also <i>give men an
upper hand in <b>highly pressured sex situations</b>, and tilt
the power relationship in favor of the man</i>.  Recent research
reveals that many girls feel pressured to have sex by their boyfriends.
With the availability of these FDA-approved post-coital pills,
no longer can these girls appeal to the fact that they are not
&quot;on the pill&quot; or that they fear pregnancy; indeed, this
removes one of the most effective reasons which these girls may
use to defend themselves.  This could have the societal effect
of cheapening women, and sexual abuse may occur more often.

<p>

(4) One societal consequence of relabeling oral contraceptives
would be to <i>falsely create an equivalency between abortion
and contraception</i>.  It trivializes human life even more to
say that the pills' abortifacient nature in this context is no
more significant than simply using contraception.  It also helps
foster an attitude of irresponsibility with regards to sex, <i>placing
a misguided emphasis on <b>short-term rather than long-term thinking</b>
and consequences</i>.

<p>

(5) Drug manufacturers haven't petitioned for the change. <i>Relabeling
shifts the burden from physicians protecting patients, to patients
protecting themselves</i>.  If patients suffer from adverse consequences
associated with taking the &quot;morning-after pill,&quot; relabeling
may protect physicians from liability, but it doesn't help the
patients who have less recourse against such harm.

<center><h2>SUPREME COURT DOOMS<br>
EDUCATIONAL DIVERSITY</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> The Supreme Court today struck down
the Virginia Military Institute's 157-year-old tradition of providing
single-sex education in <I>U.S. v. Commonwealth of Virginia</I>.
The Family Research Council had filed a friend of the court
brief in this case favoring single-sex public colleges.  FRC Senior
Policy Analyst Bob Maginnis noted that the decision &quot;limits
the diversity of education alternatives and obstructs a state's
traditional duty to provide education.&quot;

<p>

Maginnis said, &quot;Through eliminating publicly funded single-sex
education, the Supreme Court effectually instituted the Equal
Rights Amendment which failed to muster support from a majority
of the American people.  The ERA sought to equate gender with
race for discrimination laws despite the obvious differences between
men and women which do not exist among different races.  Nevertheless,
the Supreme Court by-passed the Constitution attempting to equate
race with gender by judicial fiat.&quot;

<p>

While this particular case appears to empower a woman's ability
to select the university of her choice, the shift in equal protection
jurisprudence may invalidate all 87 single-sex education facilities,
82 of which exist for females.  This shift precludes both men
and women from choosing to receive the benefits of single-sex
education.

<p>

Maginnis noted that &quot;research shows single-sex education
enables students to achieve higher educational performance and
encourages women to pursue majors such as science, math, and management.
Recognizing differences between the sexes and preparing educational
curriculum accordingly is rational; ignoring obvious differences
between the sexes in hopes they will disappear is nonsensical.&quot;

<p>

Although single-sex education may still exist in private schools,
the Supreme Court decision eliminates the possibility of single-sex
education for a large segment of the population who cannot afford
the cost of attending a private institution. Maginnis said that
&quot;the options available to individuals seeking an education
most appropriate for their specific needs is eliminated.&quot;

<center><h2><u>MISSION IMPOSSIBLE:</u><br>
REDEFINING MARRIAGE WITHOUT<br>
DESTROYING AMERICAN SOCIETY

<p>

HOW DO WE KNOW?<br>
ASK THE TOUGH QUESTIONS AT A MEDIA<br>
&amp; HILL STAFF BRIEFING ON JULY 2</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> In a special briefing for media and
Capitol Hill staffers, national leaders in the fields of law,
medicine, education and culture will outline the societal implications
of redefining marriage.

<p>

<b>Family Research Council President Gary L. Bauer will host
this historic briefing from 9:30 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. in the U.S.
Capitol, room HC-5, on July 2. Speakers list TBA.</b>

<p>

&quot;Marriage was not invented to oppress homosexuals,&quot;
Bauer noted. &quot;But most of the conversation on the Defense
of Marriage Act has centered around people's perceptions of the
homosexual experience, rather than on the consequences of  a tremendous
cultural change. The purpose of this event is to present intellectual
answers to the toughest questions. And to introduce national leaders
to the media on a revolutionary topic.

<p>

&quot;We have not begun to discuss, as a nation, the implications
of same sex 'marriage' on the law, our school, or our community.
We have barely acknowledged the many benefits of marriage between
a committed man and woman. We owe it to ourselves to understand
the possible outcomes of this unprecedented change.&quot;

<center><h2>GARY BAUER AND GRASSROOTS LEADERS ON<br>
THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT ...

<p>

HOW DOES AMERICA VIEW AN END TO<br>
MARRIAGE BETWEEN HUSBAND AND WIFE?</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> For a discussion of the grassroots
implications of redefining marriage, reporters, columnists and
editors should plan to attend a <B>9:30 A.M. MONDAY, JUNE 24</B>
news conference in the <B>MAIN LOUNGE</B> of the <B>NATIONAL PRESS
CLUB</B>. Family Research Council President Gary L. Bauer and
grassroots leaders will detail the need for the Defense of Marriage
Act along with the implications of destroying this pivotal union.

<p>

&quot;Nothing is as foundational for a culture as family. And
with poll after poll showing that American's number one concern
is family breakdown, this effort to cause the family death by
political correctness is even more out of place,&quot; said Bauer.

<p>

To discuss the grassroots reaction and strategy of DOMA, pro-family
leaders from the following states will attend: MICHIGAN, OHIO,
CALIFORNIA, ILLINOIS, KENTUCKY, MISSOURI, SOUTH DAKOTA, IDAHO,
MAINE and VIRGINIA.

<p>

Many of the men and women who will be represented have already
won battles to protect marriage. Others are in the legislative
process in the states, and all will be calling for Washington
to respect the right of citizens to set the laws for their individual
states.

<p>

The Defense of Marriage Act both defines marriage for the federal
codes and establishes the right of states to make laws governing
marriage for their citizens.

<center><h3>DEMOCRATIC LEADERS PREPARE TO RELEASE<br>
&quot;FAMILIES FIRST&quot; AGENDA SUNDAY...</h3>

<p>

<h2>BUT YOU CAN GET YOUR COPY TODAY</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b>What is a pro-family agenda? What would
America look like if family policy was more than just political
rhetoric? For answers to those questions, reporters and editors
do not have to wait for the Democratic event scheduled for Sunday.
Gary L. Bauer, president of the Family Research Council, has spent
more than 20 years answering those questions and has written a
concise book detailing what a pro-family America would look like.

<p>

For any reporter wondering how a prominent pro-family conservative
evaluates family issues, the book is a great reference and easy-to-use
guide. In fact, at the end of every chapter, yes-or-no questions
make it simple to analyze the kinds of policy initiatives making
daily news.

<p>

Already, Gary Bauer's book has sold more than 300,000 copies.
In fact, it is the number one best-selling paperback on the Christian
book sellers list.

<p>

Some people think it takes a village to figure out what's best
for children. For millions of Americans, parents decide one on
one every day.

<p>

<b>If you're looking for a pro-family American agenda, call Family
Research Council at 1-800-225-4008 or 202-393-2100.</b>

<center><h2>HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES HAVE WORSENED SINCE<br>
CHINA RECEIVED MFN STATUS</h2>

<p>

<h4>&quot;It's time to put teeth to our convictions<br>
and stop rewarding barbarity&quot; FRC says.</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;For 15 years, the United States
has extended 'most favored nation' trade status to China.  Originally,
it had been argued that an economic 'open door' might encourage
the Chinese government to shape up their human rights policies,
but in these past 15 years, we have only seen the barbarity and
cruelty of this communist regime increase,&quot; Family Research
Council Policy Analyst Gracie Hsu said Tuesday.

<p>

Hsu made her comments as Rep. Chris Smith's International Operations
and Human Rights subcommittee began its hearing on &quot;China
MFN:  Human Rights Consequences.&quot;  FRC urged Congress to
pass legislation revoking China's &quot;most favored nation&quot;
trade status because of China's continuing human rights abuses.
The House of Representatives is expected to take up legislation
regarding China's MFN status next week.

<p>

&quot;It was seven years ago when Chinese democracy-seekers were
ruthlessly gunned down at Tiananmen Square;&quot; Hsu continued,
&quot;it was only last year when Hong Kong newspapers reported
that aborted human fetuses were being cannibalized in China, sold
as health food. Last September, directly before the United
Nations Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, the Chinese
government executed nine prisoners to 'send a message' to their
own people that they should not attempt to demonstrate against
the Chinese government.

<p>

&quot;In addition to these 'newer' human rights violations, other
abuses which existed in China prior to their receiving MFN status
continue to go unabated.  For example, the Chinese government
continues to exploit prisoners for slave labor in their gulag
system known as 'laogai,' as Harry Wu has demonstrated.  Furthermore,
Chinese women continue to be forcibly aborted or sterilized, state-run
orphanages continue to starve female children to death, and Christians
continue to be systematically tortured and imprisoned.

<p>

&quot;The failure of the United States to hold China accountable
for its heinous behavior has only encouraged the communist regime
to become more oppressive because it no longer fears that any
sanctions will be taken against it.  Year after year, the United
States has issued only empty threats against the Chinese government,
and in doing so, we have strained our credibility and undercut
our own stature as a moral leader in the world.  Instead, the
U.S. has sent the shameful message that, as a country, we care
more about succeeding economically than about championing universal
human rights.

<p>

&quot;It is time for the United States to put teeth to our convictions
and revoke China's 'most favored nation' trade privileges.&quot;

<center><h2>WHO CARES ABOUT MARRIAGE ...<br>
AND WHY OFFICIAL WASHINGTON<br>
SHOULD CARE</h2>

<p>

<h4>GRASSROOTS LEADERS TO STAND WITH FAMILY RESEARCH<br>
COUNCIL ON THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> The grassroots implications of the
Defense of Marriage Act will be the topic of a <B>Monday, June
24, news conference</B> called by the Family Research Council
and Family Policy Councils from across the nation. The event will
take place in the <B>National Press Club Main Lounge at 9:30
a.m.</B>

<p>

&quot;One of the hottest issues in the public debate today is
same sex marriage. And there is every reason to believe that it
will be hotly debated by Bob Dole and Bill Clinton,&quot; said
Gary L. Bauer, Family Research Council president. &quot;FRC will
stand with state leaders who have already earned their stripes
on this issue at the local level in defense of marriage.&quot;

<p>

&quot;For anyone wondering whether the defense of home, family
and marriage is a winning issue, the grassroots victories and
support for the Defense of Marriage Act should make it clear.
Every major religion and every successful society has understood
the importance of marriage as the bringing together of the sexes.
And families across America also know just how important this
foundational institution is.&quot;

<p>

Many of the state leaders who will be in attendance have already
won battles in defense of marriage in their legislatures and will
be calling for the federal government to respect the views of
their state citizens. Others are in the middle of legislative
action on state marriage initiatives.

<p>

Family policy councils are state-based organizations that monitor
and advocate at the state level as FRC operates at the federal
level. Leaders from <b>Michigan, Ohio, California, Idaho and Missouri</b>
will be attending. Other state leaders, such as from <b>Pennsylvania,
Indiana, North Carolina and South Dakota,</b> will participate
either by statement or in person. Updated state information on
other participants will be available throughout the week.

<center><h2>SUPREME COURT EXTENDS<br>
JUDICIAL TYRANNY TO CITY LEVEL</h2>

<p>

<h4>&quot;Court has quit being a constitutional umpire</br>
and now bats clean-up for homosexual activism,&quot; Knight
says.</h4></center>

<p>

<b>Washington, D.C.--</b> In throwing out a lower court's ruling
that upheld Cincinnati's Issue 3 amendment to the city charter,
the U.S. Supreme Court went beyond its ill-reasoned decision last
month in <I>Romer v. Evans</I>, said Family Research Council Director
of  Cultural Studies Robert Knight on Monday.

<p>

In <I>Romer</I>,  the court had ruled that Colorado (or any state)
could not pass a law barring homosexuals from receiving special
civil rights protections at the state or local levels.  The law,
Colorado's Amendment Two, was designed to afford statewide protection
of speech, assembly and religion from coercive homosexual activism.

<p>

&quot;In today's Cincinnati case, the court says that voters can't
even amend their own city charters to preclude the enactment of
laws giving homosexuals more rights than other citizens,&quot;
Knight said. &quot;In remanding the case with instructions to
look at <I>Romer v. Evans</I>, the court is extending its illogic
to a new level.&quot;  As Justice Scalia said in today's dissent,
&quot;the consequence of holding this provision unconstitutional
would be that nowhere in the country may the people decide, in
democratic fashion, not to accord special protection to homosexuals.&quot;


<p>

&quot;As the sexual revolution keeps grinding, new litigants seeking
rights for pedophilia, polygamy and other sexual 'lifestyles'
will soon surface,&quot; Knight said. &quot;The people of Cincinnati
were right to try to keep 'sexual orientation' from being awarded
special protection.

<p>

&quot;The Supreme Court is stacking the deck against parents,
clergy, the Boy Scouts and businessmen who are being targeted
by coercive 'gay rights' laws.  In so doing, the court has quit
its role as constitutional umpire and is now batting clean-up
for the homosexual rights movement,&quot; Knight said. &quot;Let's
hope and pray that the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals won't be
cowed into creating more bad law.&quot;

<center><h2>ARROGANT DECISION CONTRADICTS PRIOR<br>
CASES ON PORNOGRAPHY DISTRIBUTION TO<br> 
MINORS, FRC SAYS</h2></center>

<p>

<center><h4>FRC Director of Legal Studies Cathy Cleaver says decision on
the Communications Decency Act not a pro-family defeat</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;What else should we expect from
an ACLU-hand-picked judge than a sweeping, radical decision allowing
adults to knowingly send and display pornography to minors on
the Internet?&quot; Director of Legal Studies Cathy Cleaver said
Wednesday. &quot;Nevertheless, this is not an ultimate defeat
for American families and children.  No matter where this case
goes next - either to the full Eastern District Court or the Supreme
Court - the Department of Justice will have a better opportunity
to defend the constitutionality of this statute.&quot;

<p>

Cleaver made her remarks as the Federal District Court for the
Eastern District of Pennsylvania released their decision Wednesday
on the <I>ACLU v. Reno</I> case involving the regulation of pornography
distribution to minors on the Internet.  Family Research Council
presented a &quot;friend of the court&quot; brief defending the
cyberporn provisions of the Communications Decency Act.  The decision,
written by Dolores K. Sloviter, Chief Judge of the 3rd Circuit
Court of Appeals and Carter appointee, contradicts previous Supreme
Court decisions on the distribution of indecent material through
the media.

<p>

&quot;It is an arrogant decision which flies in the face of the
Supreme Court and our society,&quot; Cleaver said.&quot; We have
long embraced the principle that those who peddle harmful material
have the obligation to keep the material from children. Outside
cyberspace, laws restrain people from displaying sexually explicit
images in public places and from selling porn magazines to children.
So, on the Internet, the burden of protecting children from exploitation
should not rest solely on the parents.&quot;

<p>

In her decision, Judge Sloviter maintains that it is &quot;either
technologically impossible or economically prohibitive&quot; for
pornographers to comply with the regulations. However, Cleaver
said that &quot;this decision reflects the Court's unwillingness
to consider proposed regulations by dismissing them as 'burdensome.'
There are constitutional ways to protect children from cyberporn
but not restrict the freedom of speech of the pornographers or
the adults.&quot;

<p>

Cleaver continued, &quot;Cyberspace is a work in progress. We
should not squander the opportunity to examine and appreciate
a world where pornography knows no bounds. Failure to enact strong
laws is a concession that the information superhighway should
belong to pornographers.  It would be like leaving a loaded gun
in a playground.&quot;

<center><h4><i>** MEDIA ADVISORY **</i></h4>

<p>

<h2>JUDICIARY COMMITTEE TO MARK UP<br>
DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE<br>
AND RELIGIOUS LIBERTY BILLS</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> The House Judiciary Committee begins
mark up today of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) (H.R. 3396)
and the Church Arson Prevention Act (H.R. 3525). 

<p>

Family Research Council President Gary Bauer said that &quot;Congress
and the President should do everything they can to extinguish
the fires that are causing the religious liberty of thousands
Americans to turn to nothing but embers.&quot; On the DOMA bill
Bauer added that &quot;the stability of this country rests on
our faith and our families. Without defending our nation against
the current threat of a redefinition of marriage, the traditional
family unit will never be the same.&quot; 

<p>

Both bills are on the fast track due to current events in Hawaii
and in the southern states.  As the date for the Hawaiian Supreme
Court case on &quot;gay marriage&quot; rapidly approaches, the
full House Judiciary Committee presses forward on DOMA today.
In the next few weeks, the Senate Judiciary Committee plans a
hearing at which Gary Bauer will testify on DOMA.

<p>

As the number of reported church fires in the southeast nears
60 since January 1995, the House Judiciary Committee begins mark
up of the Church Arson Prevention Act.  Co-sponsored by Chairman
Henry J. Hyde (R-IL) and ranking Democrat John Conyers (D-MI),
this bill enables Federal authorities to more quickly and efficiently
investigate and prosecute these cases and also protects the freedom
of religious expression.

<center><h2>WILL THERE BE ANY PRO-LIFERS IN THE BIG TENT?

<p>

GARY BAUER COMMENTS:</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> The following is a statement from Gary
L. Bauer following up on Senator Dole's comments on CNN <i>Inside
Politics</i> regarding the pro-life plank in the platform:

<p>

&quot;Senator Dole had, this past weekend, navigated some tough
shoals.  Today the ship has been run a ground again. I hope sometime
soon the senator will stop debating fellow Republicans on abortion
and start debating the most pro-abortion President in American
history.  If this keeps up, the so-called big tent won't have
any pro-lifers in it.&quot;

<center><h2>BIG GOVERNMENT CAN'T STAND FOR CHILDREN<br>
BUT IT COULD STEP ASIDE FOR PARENTS,<br>
FRC STANDS WITH MOMS AND DADS</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. -- &quot;If the tobacco lobby tried to rally
for smokers' rights, most people would mock their efforts</b>,
but when more than a 100 organizations that lobby for and receive
federal grant monies get together to pressure for more welfare
spending, they're treated as though the name of the event equals
reality. But to stand for children, you need to stand for families,
not big government,&quot; said Kristi S. Hamrick, Family Research
Council Director of Communications on Friday.

<p>

Mrs. Hamrick made her comments on the eve of the liberal Children's
Defense Fund &quot;Stand for Children&quot; rally set for June
1. She and other pro-family leaders stood together with families
who have had struggles in areas of taxes, adoption and education.
The news conference highlighted the many issues and organizations
pointedly unnoticed in the so-called &quot;non-partisan&quot;
event.

<p>

She said: <b>&quot;Big government doesn't best stand for children,
parents do</b>. And in the last 30 years, through excessive taxes,
failed welfare programs and overbearing federal control of education,
<b>parents have been squeezed out of the driver's seat of their
family cars, to be replaced by Big Brother. It's too bad he's
been headed in the wrong direction</b>.

<p>

&quot;During the last 40 years, the tax burden on the American
family has gone from one dollar in 50 to one dollar in four. It's
a reverse Robin Hood situation, taking from the poor to give to
bloated government programs and bureaucrats who act as though
they know what's best for other people's money and children.

<p>

&quot;<b>We need the $500 per child tax credit</b>. We need a
balanced budget. We need adoption tax credits. And we need them
now. We applaud the fact that Congress kept its promises and passed
this long overdue tax relief for families and began to address
the burden of debt that will be left to our children. Unfortunately,
liberal activists -- like the Children's Defense Fund -- prevailed
upon President Bill Clinton to veto this necessary tax relief
and balanced budget legislation.

<p>

<b>&quot;The Children's Defense Fund has embraced the attitude
that liberal elites know better</b> than parents. The goals of
federal policy should not be to replace the family or parents,
but to affirm them. In particular, we need to help those children
most in need get into stable families.

<p>

&quot;It is shameful that foster care, 'a temporary' program,
becomes a quasi-parent for more than 600,000 abused and neglected
children. Ten percent wait more than 7 years for the system to
give them legal, loving parents. These languishing children deserve
better. We can help them by freeing them for adoption after a
set period of time, and supporting adoption tax credits.

<p>

<b>&quot;It shouldn't surprise anyone</b> that the groups invited
to attend the rally -- groups like The Gay and Lesbian Victory
Fund, Planned Parenthood, Zero Population Growth, National Organization
for Women -- support government as surrogate parent. But men and
women nationwide understand that it's parents who best know and
best love their children. And for radical activists to claim that
they are advocates for children is so lacking in credibility,
it doesn't pass the straight face test.&quot;

<center><h2>TO THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND:<br>
THE <i>REAL</i> QUESTION IS WHO BEST STANDS FOR<br>
CHILDREN ... AND THE ANSWER IS PARENTS</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. -- &quot;The best advocates of children today
-- and the most unappreciated -- are mothers and fathers, working
together to stand for children,&quot;</b> said Gary L. Bauer,
president of Family Research Council on Wednesday, May 29. &quot;The
best thing we could do as a society to stand for children is affirm
and support parents.&quot;

<p>

<b>Bauer made his comments on the eve of the Stand for Children
Rally</b> scheduled to take place on June 1 in Washington, D.C.
The rally was organized by the liberal Children's Defense Fund
known for supporting big government intervention in the family.

<p>

<b>&quot;For Children's Defense Fund</b>, the organizer of the
impressively-named 'Stand for Children' event, the best advocate
a child has is a government official or bureaucrat. But government
is often part of the problem, both by implementing family un-friendly
policies and diminishing the importance of the people who best
love children -- parents,&quot; said Bauer.

<p>

&quot;The Children's Defense Fund has embraced the attitude of
parents as 'guilty until proven innocent.'  But healthy societies
have understood that parents are almost always those who best
defend children. And only when the home has broken down should
the state intervene to save the child and assist in getting that
child permanently into a loving family.

<p>

<b>&quot;Family is key</b>. Children from broken families should
not be captives of temporary government solutions. It is shameful
that foster care, a 'temporary' program, becomes a quasi-parent
for more than 600,000 abused and neglected children.  Ten percent
wait more than seven years for the system to give them legal,
loving parents.  These languishing children deserve more than
'bought' foster care.  As one system child of 10 years said, 'I'm
all wrapped up in programs, what I need is a mom and a dad.'

<p>

&quot;Not surprisingly, the groups invited by CDF to attend the
rally were primarily those who believe that government should
be a child's best friend. In fact, despite well-spoken words about
faith in child rearing, an anti-faith attitude has marked CDF's
policies. Children's Defense Fund has been hostile to the role
religious organizations can play as advocates for children and
families in place of government.

<p>

<b>&quot;CDF has taken the attitude that experts know best</b>
--  rarely parents -- and have consistently fought against school
choice for parents and day care vouchers for poor parents who
want their children instructed in a values setting.

<p>

&quot;But most significantly, time and time again, the Children's
Defense Fund has missed the mark on <b>the greatest crisis facing
our children -- family breakdown</b>. For them, every problem
is an economic one, explained not in the loss of values or loving
homes, but in dollars and cents. The last 30 years has shown clearly
the failure of these approaches. Unless we all stand together
for the family, our society will fall.&quot;

<center><h2>BAUER CALLS<br>
AMENDMENT TWO DECISION<br>
'DISASTER FOR SELF-GOVERNING PEOPLE'</h2>

<p>

<h4>'THE COURT IS TAKING AWAY AMERICANS'<br>
FREEDOM TO DISAGREE ON HOMOSEXUALITY'</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;Today's 6-3 Supreme Court decision
in <I>Romer v. Evans</I> is a disaster,&quot; said Gary L. Bauer,
President of the Family Research Council.  &quot;The legal details
will be debated, but the ruling's immediate impact is clear enough:
No state in the country may amend its constitution to bar the
granting of special rights for homosexuals.

<p>

&quot;No one -- including the people of Colorado -- is suggesting
that homosexuals should lose any rights; but nobody has the right
to 'win' at the ballot box even when losing.  Homosexual activists
lost at the ballot box, but now they will see their will imposed
on the people of Colorado -- and the rest of the nation -- by an 
out-of-control, unelected judiciary.

<p>

&quot;Now, with state laws being struck down, it is clear that
the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) is urgently needed.
Otherwise, marriage itself will be redefined radically by unrestrained
judges. DOMA may just be the antidote to the judicial lunacy.

<p>

&quot;As Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in a stinging dissent, 'Today's
opinion has no foundation in American constitutional law, and
barely pretends to.  The people of Colorado have adopted an entirely
reasonable provision which does not even disfavor homosexuals
in any substantive sense, but merely denies them preferential
treatment . . . Striking it down is an act, not of judicial judgment,
but of political will.'

<p>

Bauer continued: &quot;On yet another question of profound public
concern, the legislative voice of the American people has been
silenced.  Even the illusion of a level playing field evaporates
before our eyes.

<p>

&quot;Here's how it works:  Homosexuals may win laws providing
themselves with special rights, and Americans who disagree may
not pass any laws to the contrary. No other group has that kind
of power to impose its agenda on the rest of the people.  This
decision, apart from its policy consequences, should send chills
down the back of anyone who cares whether the people of this nation
any longer have the power of self-rule.&quot;

<center><h2>FAMILIES SHOULD NOT BE FORCED<br>
TO FUND CONDUCT UNBECOMING<br>
TO OUR NATIONAL HERITAGE</h2>

<p>

<h4>MEDIA INVITED TO VIEW VIDEOTAPED ACCOUNT</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;Everyone -- the media and public
-- is invited to view a 6-minute videotape detailing some of the
events that transpired during the homosexual 'Cherry Jubilee'
parties held in taxpayer-funded government buildings in April,&quot;
Family Research Council Director of Cultural Studies Robert Knight
said Wednesday.  &quot;Rep. Steve Gunderson has said the events
at two parties have been misconstrued in a written eye-witness
account -- but a picture is worth a thousand words.&quot;

<p>

&quot;The Family Research Council became concerned about a possible
misuse of family tax dollars after reading lewd advertisements
for the events in homosexual publications and other media outlets.
The gay-friendly, Washington, D.C. libertarian newspaper <I>City
Paper</I> described the Cherry Jubilee Main Event Party as a &quot;gay
'circuit' party....Circuit parties are all-night -- and usually
drug-infested -- gay dances.&quot;

<p>

&quot;Video footage taken at the Main Event clearly shows half-naked
men dancing to a disco beat in the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium,
a hall that has been used for presidential ceremonies,&quot; Knight
said.  &quot;And earlier footage shows the same auditorium hosting
the indescribably vulgar Sado-Masochistic Leather Fetish event
during the 1993 Homosexual March on Washington.  It is inappropriate
in the city of Washington, Jefferson and Lincoln for vulgar parties
thrown by anyone for any reason to be staged in our taxpayer-funded
facilities built to accomplish the noble goals of democracy. 
Hardworking American families should not be forced to facilitate
conduct unbecoming to our national heritage.  And the Rayburn
House Office Building should not be used for Sunday disco parties.

<p>

&quot;The offensive use of taxpayer-funded buildings set aside
for federal agencies and the business of the House shows that
the issue here is not 'tolerance.'  Unfortunately, that word has
been abused to force Americans to endorse, support and facilitate
offensive behavior.  And when people object to this abuse, they
are assailed as 'bigots' or 'haters.'&quot;

<p>

&quot;Despite Rep. Gunderson's words on the House floor that
nothing inappropriate took place, <b>here are four accounts to
note:</b>

<p><ul>

<li><i>&quot;...the dancing became increasingly lewd and
suggestive.  As the night wore on, the dancers began simulated
sex gyrations.  There was intense groping and stroking of each
other.  Some couples dancing on table tops, mimicked anal sex
through their clothing, while others pantomimed oral sex.....At
about 4 a.m., two men proceeded to engage in illicit sexual behavior
in the main auditorium.....oral intercourse....The restroom stalls
at the Mellon auditorium were constantly being occupied by two
men at a time....evidence of illegal drug use was present.  Audible
snorting could be heard throughout the evening in the bathroom
stalls.&quot;  -- free-lance video journalist Marc Morano in an
eye-witness account published in the Congressional Record.</i>

<p>

<li><i>&quot;Jim Jennings of Hill &amp; Knowlton, a sponsor
of the event, said he didn't witness drug use but added, 'I would
not be surprised, though, that in any group of 20-to-30-year-olds...[that]
there would be some who had done drugs...If it became clear that
[drug use] was a serious element of this event we'd stop it.'
Instead, he said he simply witnessed 'very provocative dancing.'&quot;
-- Paul Bedard, &quot;Gay GOP lawmaker defends 'Jubilee,'&quot;
The Washington Times, May 15, 1996, p. A-1.</i>

<p>

<li><i>&quot;I saw a couple of instances of people in a
corner using drugs...a fair number of people using drugs.&quot;
-- City Paper homosexual reporter John Cloud, as quoted in The
Washington Times.</i>

<p>

<li><i>&quot;The stately place was incredible -- we felt like
we were in a hallowed hall. We spent much of our time out on the
dance floor trying to cop a feel, or back in the sponsors' lounge
trying to cop a feel, or outside in the designated smoking area
trying to cop a feel and a smoke.&quot; -- columnist in the homosexual
Metro Weekly, as quoted in The Washington Times.</i>

</ul><p>

&quot;Pro-family Americans are tired of having their values disparaged
and their tax dollars wasted on undignified personal agendas,&quot;
Knight said. &quot;These charges are serious enough that they
should be investigated by Congress, by the Metro Police and by
the General Services Administration, which is responsible for
events at the Mellon Auditorium.&quot;

<center><h2>DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT IS &quot;IN<br>
CIVILIZATION'S BEST INTEREST,&quot;<br>
BAUER SAYS</h2>

<p>

<h4>FRC URGES HOUSE COMMITTEE TO SUPPORT H.R. 3396</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> The Defense of Marriage Act (H.R. 3396)
&quot;is one of the most urgent and essential pieces of legislation
to be considered in this century.  The institution of marriage
must not be taken lightly,&quot; said Family Research Council
President Gary Bauer. &quot;Clearly, those who care deeply about
children, about morality, about the well being of the larger society,
must resist the attempts by a tiny segment of the population to
diminish the foundation on which society stands.&quot;   Bauer
made these comments as the House Judiciary Constitution Subcommittee
held a hearing on the legislation that would preserve marriage
from being redefined by state courts.

<p>

Sponsored by Representatives Steve Largent (R-OK) and Bob Barr
(R-GA) and with a companion bill introduced by Senator Don Nickles
(R-OK), the Defense of Marriage Act would protect the traditional
definition of marriage as a legal union between one man and one
woman in the U.S. Code, and also protect states from any redefinitions
imposed by courts.

<p>

The issue of the definition of marriage has been quickly raised
to the federal level because it is widely believed that the Hawaiian
courts will soon take the radical step of striking down that state's
marriage law. Under the Constitution's &quot;full faith and credit&quot;
clause (Article IV), this decision could jeopardize marriage laws
in the other 49 states.

<p>

&quot;Marriage has been the foundation of civilization for thousands
of years in cultures around the world. It is the single most important
social institution, and it is the basis for the procreation of
children and the heart of family life,&quot; Bauer said. &quot;Marriage
is a societal good even without children, as husbands and wives
serve as role models for children in their neighborhoods. Marriage
between one man and one woman gives children the best economic,
emotional, and psychological environment in which to grow up.

<p>

&quot;We must step up our efforts to defend marriage now.  Instead
of submitting to radical demands that would destroy marriage,
we need to restore the primacy of marriage within the law and
the culture.&quot;

<center><h2>FRC LABELS NEEDLE EXCHANGE<br>
PROGRAMS BAD MEDICINE FOR<br>
FIGHTING AIDS</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;The fight to establish federally-funded
needle exchange programs is being urged as a wedge issue to gain
drug legalization,&quot; Family Research Council's policy analyst
Robert Maginnis said today.  &quot;Linking drug addiction with
the emotion-charged AIDS epidemic under the pro-drug umbrella
called 'harm reduction' may be good political strategy, but it's
an awful idea that is gathering momentum, and it must be countered.
Needle exchange programs are simply bad medicine.&quot; 

<p>

Maginnis spoke today at the National Conference of State Legislatures
on the topic, &quot;Getting to the Point: The Role of Sterile
Syringes in HIV Prevention.&quot;

<p>

Needle exchange programs are intended to curb the practice of
sharing needles among injecting drug users to reduce the risk
of transmitting the AIDS virus.  Exchange advocates claim that
the science conclusively supports these programs, however on close
examination the science is seriously flawed.

<p>

&quot;The science downplays sexual transmission of HIV among addicts,&quot;
Maginnis said.  &quot;Some resort to prostitution to fund their
addiction.  After all, non-needle-using crack addicts have a high
incidence of HIV. Most of the needle studies fail to interview
neighborhood residents to see whether they approve of the effect
of these programs.  They also tend to trivialize the drug problem
and offer no alternative solutions.

<p>

&quot;Needle exchanges promote a breakdown in law and order. They
are poor medicine and poor public health practice. Our goal should
be to eliminate drug abuse, not find a safer way to do it.  The
best way to curb the spread of HIV among injecting drug users
is to get them off drugs.&quot;

<center><h2>DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE IS &quot;CULTURAL<br>
WATERSHED,&quot; BAUER SAYS</h2>

<p>

<h4>FRC GIVES FULL SUPPORT TO DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> The Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA)
&quot;is one of the most crucial pieces of legislation to be considered
in this or any year. This is a cultural watershed,&quot; said
Family Research Council President Gary Bauer. &quot;Will America
move to protect marriage -- the foundation of civilization --
or will America become the first nation to destroy marriage? At
stake is nothing less than the future of the nation and the well
being of our children.&quot;

<p>

The Defense of Marriage Act was announced today in the House and
the Senate, and Family Research Council gave its full support
to the legislation that would protect marriage against current
attempts to redefine it.  Sponsored by Representatives Steve Largent
(R-OK) and Bob Barr (R-GA) and with a companion bill introduced
by Senator Don Nickles (R-OK), the Defense of Marriage Act would
protect the traditional definition of marriage as a legal union
between one man and one woman in the U.S. Code, and thus protect
states from any redefinitions imposed by courts.

<p>

The issue of the definition of marriage was raised to the federal
level because it is widely believed that the Hawaiian Supreme
Court will soon take the radical step of striking down the state's
marriage law. Under the Constitution's &quot;full faith and credit&quot;
clause (Article IV), this decision could jeopardize marriage laws
in the other 49 states.

<p>

Bauer noted that more than 30 states have legislative activities
underway to address this threat and 9 have already enacted such
laws. But because marriage is referenced in the U.S. Code, the
Uniform Code of Military Justice, and in Social Security regulations,
federal law is necessary to ensure that no state would be forced
to submit to a redefinition of marriage should another state's
court system take that step.

<p>

&quot;The heart of family life is marriage,&quot; Bauer said.
&quot;It brings the two sexes together in a unique legal, social,
economic and spiritual union -- no other relationship provides
society with the benefits that marriage does. As we have drifted
from the defense of marriage, we have experienced severe social
and economic problems, and now, marriage is under attack as never
before. If the one-man, one-woman definition of marriage is broken,
there is no logical stopping point for continuing the assault
on marriage. No civilization has ever introduced a counterfeit
definition of marriage, and those who have allowed the family
to be weakened have not survived.&quot;

<center><h2>HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES DISQUALIFY<br>
CHINA FROM RECEIVING<br>
&quot;MOST FAVORED NATION&quot; STATUS</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> The Family Research Council on Tuesday
urged the Clinton Administration to revoke China's &quot;most
favored nation&quot; trade status because of China's myriad human
rights abuses.

<p>

Policy Analyst Gracie Hsu released the following statement prior
to the press conference held by the Coalition to Stop MFN for
China: 

<p>

&quot;China's horrific record on human rights is undisputable.
Its blatant disregard for the sanctity of human life has led
to such abuses as the massacre of democracy-seekers at Tiannanmen
Square, the exploitation of prisoners as slave laborers, women
being forcibly aborted or sterilized, female infanticide, and
the systematic intimidation, torture, and imprisonment of Christians.

<p>

&quot;In the 15 years since the United States has granted China
'most favored nation' trade status, our economic 'open door' policy
has not resulted in even one of these human rights abuses being
halted or abated.  Even if there was, at one point, justification
for extending MFN status to China, arguing that economic trade
might lead to greater influence in the human rights realm, China's
record of continued human rights abuses should completely dispel
that notion.

<p>

&quot;Up to now, the Clinton Administration has only paid lip
service to human rights.  For even while Hillary Clinton was verbally
condemning coercive abortion policies last September in Beijing,
President Clinton was refusing to grant asylum to several Chinese
women who fled their homeland to escape their country's forced
abortion policies.  It is time for President Clinton to put actions
to his words.

<p>

&quot;The oppressive nature of this Chinese government regime
is well-known.  And if the United States does not use the carrot
of its economic markets to encourage China to a humane standard,
then the stick should be the closing of our economic doors.

<p>

&quot;Those obsessed with the idea that there is money to be made
in China seem to forget that the United States is the richest
market in the world and has a lot to offer or withhold. If all
that we communicate to the world is that money making is our only
value, then we cannot be surprised when dictators rise to power,
promising only economic concessions while people die.&quot;

<center><h2>FRC SUPPORTS DEFENSE BILL<br>
CUTTING GOVERMENT'S ROLE AS<br>
PORNOGRAPHY SALESMAN</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> The U.S. House of Representative's
National Defense Committee passed by voice vote an amendment today
to the 1997 Defense Authorization Act that would prohibit the
sale or rental of pornography anywhere on U.S. military property.

<p>

Robert Maginnis, FRC's director for the Military Readiness Project
and a retired Army lieutenant colonel, said &quot;This legislation
will aid in strengthening the moral character of our military
personnel, as well as protect the military family. Sexually explicit
material intended to appeal to prurient interests should not be
sold in government stores.&quot;

<p>

But in 1995, the Army Air Force Exchange Service sold more than
$5 million of pornographic materials and today the Pentagon's
bookstore sells <I>Playboy, Penthouse, Playgirl, Penthouse Letters,
Penthouse Comics and Penthouse Men's Adventure Comix</I>. 

<p>

According to Colonel Maginnis, &quot;Pornographic material, like
alcohol, is a powerful stimulant.  Beginning with 'soft'  pornography
sold in military stores, the desire for sexually explicit material
grows to require more explicit images in order to reach the previous
level of sexual arousal.  Gradually, the addict becomes desensitized
even to the more explicit material and may act out sexual fantasies
inspired by the material.&quot;

<p>

The Military Honor and Decency Act comes in the wake of the rape
of a 12-year-old girl in Okinawa by a U.S. sailor and two Marines,
and the groping of a female sailor by a drunken chief petty officer
on a commercial flight.

<p>

Under current policy, military store managers select magazines
based on sales volume, customer preferences, and, in the case
of pornographic material, whether it fits the definition of obscenity
outlined by the Supreme Court. The high court's criteria were
written to protect freedom of speech and expression but there
are kinds not protected by the Constitution.  These include, among
others, slander, libel, perjury, yelling &quot;fire&quot; in a
crowded theater and child pornography.

<p>

&quot;The government should not be involved in the distribution
of material that conflicts with the principles of honor and decency,&quot;
said Maginnis.  &quot;With the growing number of sexual misconduct
cases in the military, it is time the federal government sever
its involvement in the pornography trade.&quot;

<center><h2>GOVERNMENT SHOULD DO UNTO OTHERS...<br>
ORDINARY PEOPLE DESERVE THE SAME PERKS<br>
AS FEDERAL WORKERS, BAUER SAYS</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council President Gary
L. Bauer joined with Sen. John Ashcroft Tuesday in calling for
increased workplace flexibility and more &quot;comp time&quot;
options. Currently, laws on a 40-hour workweek prohibit flexible
schedules, and rather than merely offer time-and-a-half money
for overtime work, comp time could be expanded to offer time-and-a-half-off
options as well.

<p>

Bauer made the following comments during a 3 p.m. news conference
in S-211 of the U.S. Capitol:

<p>

&quot;Ironically, the federal government has boasted of its success
in providing flexible scheduling for the people who fill its ranks
... but rank and file Americans don't have the same options. Government
should do unto others what it has done for itself -- remove the
restrictions on a work week and allow freedom to enter the kinds
of  start-up businesses that are on the cutting edge of growth
and opportunity. And to allow those businesses which built America
to offer the same options that federal workers receive.

<p>

&quot;Recent focus groups have shown that women in particular
are deeply concerned about the amount of  time they have to spend
together as a family. Children's schedules are not always compatible
with corporate America. We need to get government bureaucrats
out of the scheduling business that takes place between employers
and employees who are juggling jobs and families. A recent study
conducted by the Family and Work Institute found that 66 percent
of employed families with children under 18 indicated that they
didn't have enough time for their children. And an original poll,
conducted for the Family Research Council, showed that 61 percent
of Americans favor more time over more money. We have the ability
to address the Family Time Famine in America.

<p>

&quot;Increasing opportunity is a women's issue, a children's
issue and most particularly, a family issue.

<p>

&quot;And I would also urge the Congress to adopt the $500 per
child tax credit, because it would reduce economic pressures on
families, thereby freeing parents to spend more time with their
children. These are the kinds of changes that men and women desired
when they voted for a change in Washington D.C. And I commend
Sen. Ashcroft's leadership in spearheading this positive change
in today's workplace.&quot;

<center><h4>EDITORS' NOTE: REPORTS INDICATE CLINTON TO RELEASE 
PARTIAL-BIRTH VETO STATEMENT AT 5 P.M.</h4>

<p>

<h2>CLINTON SHOWS SHOCKING DISREGARD FOR THE VALUES OF THE 
<i>MAJORITY</i> OF AMERICANS, AGAIN REWARDS PRO-ABORTION ALLIES</h2>

<p>

<h3><i>&quot;Clinton seems to find no life worth saving</i>,&quot;
says Bauer</h3></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;Clinton's veto of  the overwhelmingly
supported Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act shows once again his
absolute loyalty to the most extreme abortion advocates,&quot;
Family Research Council President Gary L. Bauer said on Wednesday.

<p>

Bauer made the following statement after Clinton vetoed the Partial-Birth
Abortion Ban Act -- a measure which passed both houses with wider
margins than almost any bill this session.

<p>

Bauer noted: &quot;Polling out this week shows once again that
the vast majority of Americans -- more than two-thirds -- support
either restrictions on abortion or its elimination. These numbers
tell a story that every man and woman of conscience understands.
People do not want to see life casually ended. And they do not
accept abortion as the highest and best offering of our great
Constitution. They are troubled by a 1.5-million person death
count every year. And the overwhelming success of pro-life candidates
in the last election, both Democratic and Republican, underscores
the troubled electorate's concern for run-away abortion 'rights'
turned into societal wrongs.

<p>

&quot;Bill Clinton has again aligned himself with the most extremist
elements of the abortion lobby -- those who see no value in life
poised on the edge of birth. Bill Clinton said he wants abortion
to be rare, but he seems to see no life worth saving, not even
a fully viable child, whose living brain tissue is vacuumed out,
causing painful death.

<p>

&quot;I am among the majority of Americans who knows that our
nation has more to offer than abortion. And from my travels around
the country, I can say for certain that this veto will mark the
Bill Clinton presidency with a stain that will not be white washed
with any amount of election rhetoric.&quot;

<center><h2>FAMILY RESEARCH COUNCIL<br>
DEFENDS MILITARY LAW<br>
IN <i>RICHENBERG V. PERRY</i></h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> <I>Richenberg v. Perry</I>, a military
case that involves a former air force captain challenging his
discharge for homosexuality, will be heard today in a federal
appeals court in St. Louis, Missouri.  The Family Research Council's
Military Readiness Project, the only national group actively defending
the military's legal ban in court, filed an amicus curiae brief
defending the federal law.  MRP representatives will be attending
the case in St. Louis and will be available for interviews. 

<p>

MRP Director Robert Maginnis, a retired Lieutenant Colonel, explains,
&quot;FRC is in court because the Clinton administration refuses
to defend the law.  Rather, it defends a faulty implementation
of the law labeled &quot;Don't Ask, Don't Tell&quot; which permits
homosexuals to serve.  The American people, the law and military
tradition have spoken clearly on this issue:  homosexuals are
not permitted to serve in the armed forces.&quot;

<p>

MRP counsel Melissa Wells-Petry, a former Army litigator, wrote
in the brief that Richenberg's case is fatally flawed when it
attacks the &quot;Don't Ask, Don't Tell&quot; implementing regulations.
&quot;This policy,&quot; she says, is only &quot;a political myth.&quot;
According to Wells-Petry, Richenberg's case argues that &quot;treating
detected and undetected homosexuals differently in terms of eligibility
for military service renders the policy irrational, in that it
furthers no legitimate governmental goal&quot; by sifting homosexuals
into two camps, separated only by detection.  On this, she notes,
&quot;No doubt the policy described by Richenberg might pose the
constitutional questions he attempts to raise.  But no such policy
is at issue in this case.&quot;

<p>

In addition, she holds that the Department of Justice does not
even need to defend the regulations.  Instead, the law passed
by Congress, 10 U.S.C. &#167; 654, is what really is at issue
and is quite clear:  all homosexuals are barred from service.
Thus, there is no legal loophole through which homosexuals can
serve in the military.  The Military Readiness Project has long
maintained that the real problem is the Clinton Administration's
persistence in claiming the law permits homosexuals to serve instead
of enforcing the law's true intent, namely, to codify the armed
forces' long and constitutional policy of prohibiting homosexual
service.

<p>

MRP has provided briefs in similar cases concerning homosexual
servicemembers.  In the 4th Circuit case of <I>Thomasson v. Perry</I>,
it was given the unusual opportunity to make oral arguments before
the full court.

<p>

The <I>Richenberg</I> case is one of eight appellate cases making
their way to the Supreme Court. It's expected that either the
2nd Circuit's <I>Abel</I> case or the <I>Thomasson</I> case will
likely be heard on appeal by the high court in its next session.

<center><h2>BAUER TO EDUCATION SUMMIT:<br>
&quot;Empowering Parents helps Kids&quot;</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;When all is said and done, the
highest goal of an education summit should be our children's improved
learning,&quot; Family Research Council President Gary Bauer said
on Tuesday as the Governor's Education summit began. Bauer, undersecretary
of education during the Reagan Administration, urged the attendees
of the summit to focus their attention on initiatives that help
children -- not bureaucrats.

<p>

&quot;We know that these kinds of meetings over the years have
made the participants feel good, but on the whole, they've done
little to improve American education,&quot; Bauer said. &quot;But
when it comes to our kids, it's worth the effort to find what
really works. I would urge the attendees to follow these principles:

<p><b>

<li>Empower Parents not bureaucrats.<br>
<li>Reject the anti-American National History Standards<br>
<li>Submit any agreements made at the summit to the American
people.

</b><p>

&quot;I do not believe government-funded or endorsed national
standards will increase local control or lead to better education,&quot;
Bauer said. &quot;Summit leaders can score real achievement by
voting to reject the outrageously biased, anti-American history
standards.  Proponents of national standards have had a difficult
time assuring the American people that their standards would be
high enough to make America internationally competitive and at
the same time low enough so that the vast majority of students
could achieve to such levels.&quot;

<p>

Bauer noted that a goal since the Reagan Administration was to
dismantle the U.S. Department of Education. &quot;Governors have
a keen interest in education. They therefore should support calls
for abolishing the Department of Education. We need to bring decision
making authority back to local schools and local leaders.&quot;

<p>

&quot;But no matter what is agreed upon,&quot; Bauer said, &quot;I
urge the governors not to sign any agreement that has not been
released for public comment in their states.  I urge CEO's not
to sign any agreement that would increase government interference
with the American economy. American students deserve our best
efforts in their behalf.&quot;

<p>

<i>REPORTERS PLEASE NOTE: FRC Special Assistant to the President
Robert Morrison is attending the summit and will be available
for comment on site.</i>

<center><h2>CLINTON WRONG AGAIN ON<br>
TEENS AND AIDS</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> A White House report issued today shows
that 25 percent of Americans who are infected with AIDS each year
are under the age of 20.  The report calls for more explicit AIDS
education, and HIV testing without parental notice.
<p>
&quot;This is a policy-driven tragedy unfolding, and the Clinton
Administration is offering only more of the same prescription
that got us here in the first place,&quot; said Family Research
Council Director of Cultural Studies Robert H. Knight.  &quot;To
say that lack of information is causing the problem is outrageous.
The schools inundate children with graphic sex information beginning
in kindergarten, and when record numbers of teens experiment and
contract diseases and unwanted pregnancies, the answer, we are
told, is always more of the same -- more condoms, more 'education,'
more knowledge of deviant sex practices -- and less parental input.
<p>
&quot;Teens themselves have told reporters that information is
not the problem -- it's the presentation of sex as an inevitable
plumbing exercise in a sex-saturated culture, without regard for
marriage.  According to a University of Minnesota study by a homosexual
researcher, young males &quot;often engaged in high-risk sex despite
good knowledge about HIV.&quot;  The teens &quot;correctly recognized
they were more likely than others to be infected, but were not
deterred from dangerous behavior.&quot;  (Dr. Gary Remafedi, survey
of 239 gay and bisexual males aged 13 to 21, 1994).
<p>
Knight adds, &quot;The condom-based approach has failed miserably
for 20 years and ruined countless lives.  Good programs are available
that work, but the Clinton Administration and their allies are
trying to kill them off.  And the same government that wants to
steal children's innocence now wants to test them for HIV without
parents' knowledge.
<p>
&quot;Parents across America are vitally concerned about their
children's well-being, and they -- not the government -- should be
the primary counselor in their child's sexual development,&quot;
Knight said.  &quot;Parents must not be cut out of their children's
lives, especially if their child's life is in jeopardy. No one
should face HIV test results alone,&quot; Knight said.

<center><h2>MILITARY CASE <i>PHILIPS V. PERRY</i><br>
TESTS HOMOSEXUAL LAW</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C.</b> --  In Seattle today, a Federal Appeals
court will <I>hear Philips v. Perry</I>, a case involving an openly
homosexual sailor who admitted to past misconduct and who intends
to continue that practice.  On October 27, 1995, the Family Research
Council filed a friend of the court brief calling for the dismissal
of the case.
<p>
Lieutenant Colonel Robert L. Maginnis (U.S.A., Ret.), FRC's director
of the Military Readiness Project (MRP) will attend the Seattle
hearing.  He said, &quot;Machinist Mate Mark Philips confessed
to homosexual misconduct in 1992 but he filed a lawsuit blocking
his discharge.&quot;  FRC first joined this case in early 1995
by filing a court brief at the trial court level.  Philips lost
that challenge.
<p>
&quot;Philips is a homosexual crusader,&quot; said Colonel Maginnis,
&quot;who wants to use the court to air and resolve national policy
on homosexuals in the military and in particular Congress' constitutional
authority to dictate military personnel policy.&quot;
<p>
Machinist Mate Philips claims that his discharge is based on homosexual
&quot;status&quot; when in fact the Navy board was swayed by his
admission of misconduct.  He also claims there are sexual acts
that are guaranteed within a constitutionally protected zone of
privacy.
<p>
This case is one of five military homosexual cases now pending
at the Federal Appellate Court level and three cases at the Federal
District Court level.  The MRP is involved in all the appellate
cases as an amicus and had the unusual opportunity last December
to make oral arguments before the Fourth Circuit's <I>Thomasson
v. Perry</I> hearing. 
<p>
As the nation's leading organization defending the military's
ban, FRC argues that many of these cases came about because the
Clinton administration purposely did an end run around the law
and wrote implementing regulations labeled &quot;Don't Ask, Don't
Tell&quot; which permit homosexuals to serve.  The law prohibits
service by homosexuals.

<title>February 28, 1996 Press Release</title>
<body>
<center><h2>MEMO</h2></center>
<p>
<b>February 28, 1996
<p>
TO:     National News Media<br>
FROM:   Gary L. Bauer, President, Family Research Council<br>
RE:     Statement on Religious Bigotry in Media Coverage</b>
<p>
<b>Religious bigotry, and facile appeals to such bigotry, have no place in the 
American political lexicon.</b> In the past few weeks, some media coverage of 
the 1996 Presidential campaign has betrayed a disturbing insensitivity to the
standards of civil discourse that our nation's founders intended to prevail in
public debate.  Last Friday night's edition of ABC's Nightline is only the latest
example of this insensitivity, an uncharacteristically superficial report by Ted
Koppel that attempted to legitimize the idea that American Catholics in the
1940s and 1950s were given to reflexive prejudice against their fellow Jewish
Americans.
<p>
<B>Americans of all faiths -- and even no faith -- cherish a heritage of religious 
liberty that celebrates the contributions of diverse denominations to our 
national life.</b>  They honor the examples of tolerance and courage that abound
in our history, from Sam Adams' call that the First Continental Congress open
with the prayer of a clergyman not of his own denomination, to the famed
incident of the four chaplains -- a rabbi, a Methodist minister, a
Catholic priest, and a Dutch Reformed minister -- who sacrificed their 
life-jackets to other men and perished in the sinking of the troop ship 
Dorchester in July 1943.
<p>
<b>Prejudice has certainly written dark chapters in every era of American 
history, but ABC breaches its responsibility to the American people when it 
paints a misleading and malignant portrait of American Catholics.</b>  As an
organization representing hundreds of thousands of American families, including
Catholics, the Family Research Council deplores ABC's report.  We urge everyone
engaged in coverage of the 1996 elections to maintain the highest standards
of journalistic ethics and to cover the issues with factuality and fairness. ABC
owes all religious people of goodwill a swift and heartfelt apology.

<center><h2>CLINTON WRONG ON PARTIAL BIRTH</h2>
<p>
<h4>PRO-LIFE AMERICANS AND CLINTON KNOW THAT<br>
HEALTH OF THE MOTHER = ALL ABORTIONS</h4></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council Policy Analyst
Gracie Hsu made the following statement following President Clinton's
comments regarding his new position on the Partial Birth Abortion
Ban Act:
<p>
&quot;After Congressional hearings and extended public debate
and no doubt prayerful consideration, members of both houses of
Congress, on both sides of the aisle, passed a bill which would
ban partial birth abortions.  However, President Clinton has now
announced that, after 'praying' long and hard, he will support
the late-term abortions of babies who are breech-delivered alive
until all but the head remains in the mother's womb, and who die
because the abortionist stabs the back of their heads to suction
out their brains.
<p>
&quot;That President Clinton would veto a ban on a procedure characterized
as 'four-fifths infanticide and one-fifth abortion' shows his
clear disregard for the value of human life.
<p>
&quot;Even worse, Mr. Clinton has tried to cloud his extreme pro-abortion
stance by saying that he, in fact, supports the ban except 'to
save the life of the mother and <I><B>for the mother's health</B></I>.'
<p>
&quot;The Partial Birth Abortion Ban, as passed by both houses
of Congress, already includes a life of the mother exception.
But the health clause that President Clinton seeks to include
is so broadly defined in U.S. law that it would make <b>all</b>
partial-birth abortions acceptable, including the 80 percent of
partial birth abortions that are performed for purely elective
reasons.
<p>
&quot;The 1973 <I>Doe v. Bolton</I> Supreme Court decision defined
'health' as encompassing '<I>all</I> factors -- physical, <I>emotional,
psychological, familial</I>, and the woman's age -- relevant to
the <I>well-being</I> of the patient' (emphasis added).  As a
Yale Law school graduate, President Clinton is completely aware
that adding a health exception to the partial birth abortion ban
would render the bill meaningless.  And his attempts to deceive
the public by talking about prayer and health will not overcome
the overwhelming objections to this heinous form of infanticide.&quot;

<center><h2>SUING SUCCESSES, FLAUNTING FAILURES:<br>
HENRY FOSTER'S RECORD<br>
ON TEEN PREGNANCY</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C.</b> -- Family Research Council Policy Analyst
Gracie Hsu made the following statement Wednesday in response
to President Clinton's teen pregnancy task force under the leadership
of failed Surgeon General nominee Dr. Henry Foster:
<p>
&quot;<B>Dr. Foster and Planned Parenthood</B> -- Dr. Henry Foster
has had a long-time association with Planned Parenthood and promotes
its goals.  Dr. Foster was a member of the Board of Directors
for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA) for several
years beginning in 1975.  In 1989, Dr. Foster served on PPFA's
National Leadership Committee in their Campaign to Keep Abortion
Safe and Legal, the main purpose of which was to fight against
parental consent laws, waiting periods, and other moderate restrictions
that states have the right to set.  In 1992, Dr. Foster was one
of PPFA's Public Policy Advocates, promoting PPFA's goals and
programs in the public policy realm.
<p>
&quot;<B>Suing Successes</B> -- Planned Parenthood has filed lawsuits
against pregnancy prevention programs that work.  For example,
in Hemet, California, Planned Parenthood sued to remove three
successful abstinence programs -- <I>Teen-Aid, Sex Respect, </I>and<I>
Choosing the Best</I> -- from the school district.  In independent
evaluations, all three abstinence programs proved to reduce the
teen sexual activity level, the teen pregnancy rate, and help
change students' attitudes towards saving sex until marriage.
In Jacksonville, Florida, Planned Parenthood filed a lawsuit
against <I>Teen-Aid</I> despite the fact that Teen-Aid reduced
the teen pregnancy rate by 35 percent just 3 years after its implementation.
<p>
&quot;<B>Flaunting Failures</B> -- Dr. Foster sought to become
Surgeon General on the platform of combatting teen pregnancy due
to his experience with his own Nashville-based program, &quot;I
Have A Future&quot; (IHAF).  But IHAF's contraceptive-based approach
was a proven failure -- participants in the program actually showed
<I>higher</I> rates of sexual activity than those outside of the
program, according to a Carnegie Corporation evaluation.  These
results are consistent with other contraceptive-based programs
-- all of which show an increase in sexual activity rates, teen
pregnancy rates, and increased exposure to sexually-transmitted
diseases.
<p>
&quot;<B>What's Wrong With This Picture?</B> -- Why has President
Clinton chosen Dr. Foster as his senior advisor on teen pregnancy
when it is clear that Dr. Foster's policies and philosophy have
failed?  And, why has Mike McCurry said that the task force will
pursue contraceptive-based approaches when research clearly shows
that such approaches only put our children at higher risk?  Most
of all, why select a senior advisor on teen pregnancy who associates
himself with suing prevention programs that do indeed work?  President
Clinton, the American people await your answer.&quot;

<center><h2>CHALLENGE TO PRESIDENT CLINTON:<br>
SUPPORT <i>REAL</i> PREVENTION OF<br>
TEENAGE PREGNANCY</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C.</b> -- Family Research Council Policy Analyst
Gracie Hsu made the following statement Tuesday in response to
President Clinton's newly formed task force to combat teen pregnancy
under the leadership of failed Surgeon General nominee Dr. Henry
Foster:
<p>
&quot;<b>For the Record --</b> In his State of the Union address,
President Clinton said that he would form an organization which
would 'support grass-roots community efforts all across our country
in a national campaign against teen pregnancy.'
<p>
&quot;<b>Abstinence Programs Work</b> -- If President Clinton
is really serious about decreasing the teenage pregnancy rate,
he needs to look no further than the myriad of successful abstinence
programs around the country.
<p><ul>
<li>For example, <I>Best Friends</I> is a program which connects
teenage girls with mentors and utilizes the benefits of positive
peer pressure to promote abstinence.  A recent evaluation showed
that only 1.1 percent of its participants became pregnant, as
opposed to the 25 percent pregnancy rate for other girls in the
city.
<p>
<li>An evaluation of <I>Sex Respect</I>, an abstinence-based curriculum,
found that students participating in the program had considerably
lower pregnancy rates than those in a comparison group (5 percent
vs. 9 percent).
<p>
<li>Since Jacksonville, Florida (the fifteenth largest school
district in the nation) implemented the abstinence curriculum
<I>Teen-Aid</I> three years ago, the rate of teen pregnancy has
dropped by 35 percent.
<p>
<li>Other successful programs abound such as <I>True Love Waits</I>,
<I>Reasonable Reasons To Wait</I>, <I>Choosing the Best</I>, and
<I>AANCHOR</I>, among others.  And the one common denominator
in all these programs is that they emphasize abstinence and character
development.
</ul><p>
&quot;<B>Contraceptive-Based Approaches Fail</B> -- The data are
clear:  President Clinton should not support contraceptive-based
programs because they have proven to fail, increasing not only
the teen pregnancy rate but also teen sexual activity.
<p><ul>
<li>A study using data from the 1988 National Survey of Adolescent
Males (NSAM) found that adolescent males who had been instructed
in sexual biology and birth control were at a higher risk of early
intercourse than were those who had received no instruction.
<p>
<li>After Balboa High School in San Francisco instituted a condom
availability program, the school's overall teenage pregnancy rate
increased by a fourth in just two years.
<p>
<li>A recent <I>Washington Times</I> article reported that teen
pregnancy rates are higher in states that teach condom use than
in states that eschew sex education or stress abstinence.
<p>
<li>Participants in Dr. Henry Foster's Nashville-based program,
&quot;<I>I Have A Future</I>,&quot; actually showed higher rates
of sexual activity than those outside of the program, according
to a Carnegie Corporation evaluation.
</ul><p>
&quot;<B>What Will The Future Record Show?</B> -- The real question
is, will the Clinton/Foster task force support the abstinence
programs which have proven successful in reducing not only teenage
pregnancy, but also teenage sexual activity?  Or, will the task
force continue to support failed contraceptive programs and policies,
such as Dr. Foster's very own &quot;I Have A Future&quot; program?
<p>
&quot;We urge the President to carefully examine the data.  The
Family Research Council hopes that this task force will support
SUCCESS over IDEOLOGY.&quot;

<center><h2>PROMOTING FAILED POLICIES ON<br>
TEEN PREGNANCY:<br>
DR. HENRY FOSTER, TAKE 2</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C.</b> -- Family Research Council Policy Analyst
Gracie Hsu made the following statement Monday in response to
President Clinton's newly formed task force to combat teen pregnancy
headed by failed Surgeon General nominee Dr. Henry Foster:
<p>
&quot;<B>Disappointing -- </B>Bill Clinton in his State of the
Union Address sounded a very loud call for sounder values in society.
We were skeptical but hopeful that he intended to follow through
with the ideas expressed in his speech. Unfortunately, this appointment
shows that that is not the case.
<p>
&quot;<B>Replicating Failure -- </B>When President Clinton nominated
Dr. Henry Foster for Surgeon General, he said that he wanted Foster's
program, 'I Have A Future' replicated throughout the nation. 
But part of  the reason Dr. Foster was rejected as Surgeon General
was because his program, like all contraceptive-based programs,
was a proven failure.  Participants in Dr. Foster's 'I Have A
Future' program actually showed <I>higher</I> rates of sexual
activity than those outside of the program, according to a Carnegie
Corporation evaluation.
<p>
&quot;During Dr. Foster's confirmation hearings, Senator Nancy
Kassebaum (R-KS) said that 'the bottom line' was that 'there were
difficulties' (with Foster's program), including a 'dropout rate
[of]...at least 47.6 percent.'
<p>
&quot;<B>What Works?</B> -- Evaluation studies are crystal clear:
the only programs that really work to reduce teen pregnancy are
ABSTINENCE programs.  During his State of the Union address, President
Clinton noted that the teen pregnancy rate has dropped for two
years in a row.  The reason for this decline is <b>not</b> due
to federally-funded &quot;safe sex&quot; programs nor Joycelyn
Elders' conscience-assaulting promotion of condoms. Rather<I><B>,
teen pregnancy is declining because more teens are choosing abstinence</B></I>
despite all of the federal government's efforts to promote the
contrary. Statistics published by the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention show that the decrease in teen pregnancy rates
is concurrent with the rising number of teens choosing to abstain
from sex.
<p>
&quot;<B>Lacking Common Sense</B> -- Why has the President appointed
Dr. Henry Foster to head a task force to combat teen pregnancy
when Dr. Foster's own program has a proven track record of failure?
Why has the President ignored all the data about the effectiveness
of abstinence-based programs and instead chosen to promote a failed
policy nationwide?
<p>
&quot;The American people rejected Joycelyn Elders, Kristine Gebbie,
and Dr. Henry Foster because they all promoted the same disastrous
policies.  Each of them was finally ousted because of the outcry
of the American people against their programs.  The President
should know that he cannot escape accountability simply by giving
Dr. Foster a back door by which to enter to do more harm to our
children.&quot;

<center><h2>FORGET DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN SPINNING<br>
WHAT IS A PRO-FAMILY PLATFORM?<br>
HOW CAN YOU KNOW WHO WILL FIGHT FOR IT?<br>
<p>
THERE IS A SINGLE SOURCE.<br>
<i>OUR HOPES, OUR DREAMS</i></h2></center>
<p>
<B>WASHINGTON, D.C</B>. -- &quot;At Family Research Council, we
don't endorse candidates. But we want <b>every</b> candidate to
deal with the breakdown of values and the disintegration of the
family that is eroding the America of our hopes and dreams,&quot;
said Gary L. Bauer, president of Family Research Council and author
of the soon-to-be released <I><B>Our Hopes, Our Dreams: A Vision
for America.</B></I>
<p>
<b>This book is the answer to the most asked questions</b>, &quot;What
do you want for America?&quot; and &quot;What do you want people
to do about it?&quot; Gary Bauer is uniquely qualified to answer
those questions. His almost 30 years in political life include
serving President Ronald Reagan as domestic policy advisor and
serving as undersecretary of education under William Bennett.
<p>
Bauer notes, &quot;Every politician talks about supporting the
family, but when the election results are in and the rhetoric
dies down, different visions are in conflict. And every time,
America's families wonder why the people who sounded so good,
could make such bad policy. My book is a tool for deciphering
exactly what a politician means by 'pro-family policy.'
<p>
&quot;<b>Hillary Clinton says it takes a village to raise a child</b>,
but the real 'village' is founded on strong parents, supported
by family, friends, churches, schools and the local community.
Big government isn't a village. And bureaucrats in Washington,
D.C. are not better able to make decisions for children than loving
parents. The village must be an environment in which families
are supported and strengthened.
<p>
&quot;<b>The problem today <i>is</i> the village</b>. Cultural
pollution, crime, violence, liberal government policies, sexually
explicit images, unresponsive educators and anti-faith bigotry
are among the 'village forces' that work against families trying
to teach their children right from wrong and trying to give them
a sense of  the American dream.
<p>
&quot;<b>The dream is not the pursuit of money</b>, but it is
the hope that every person will have the opportunity to succeed
in a world that does not self-destruct, but has enduring values
that protect us and our families.&quot;
<p>
Published by Focus on the Family,<I> Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I>
is a valuable grassroots tool. You can order a copy by calling
1-800-225-4008. <I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I> will be available
Feb. 1 at your local Christian bookstore.
<p>
&quot;<b>Dr. James Dobson and I want to get this book to one
million readers in 1996</b>,&quot; Bauer noted, &quot;so that
every American will have a pro-family resource. At the end of
each chapter, Yes-or-No questions make it possible for people
to take the spin out of the rhetoric.
<p>
&quot;But the heart of the book is the 'Compact with Our Fellow
Americans,' a commitment for those who sign it  that we will work
together to heal America and make it the place of  our hopes and
dreams.&quot;

<center><h2>AFTER JUDGE WITHDRAWAL, U.S. APPEALS<br>
COURT SET TO HEAR ABEL CASE</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> After almost a month delay, <I>Abel
et. al, v. U.S.A. et. al</I>, one of the many cases involving homosexuals in 
the military, will be heard today in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second 
Circuit in New York City.  On Dec. 19, Judge Guido Calabresi recused himself
from the case because of a letter he had written in favor of a
more liberal position than the law at the time set out.  Today,
a new three judge panel will hear arguments about six service
members' discharges on the basis of admission of homosexuality.
 Family Research Council filed a friend of the court brief, written
by Melissa Wells-Petry, counsel for FRC's Military Readiness Project,
in the case.  Experts will be available for comment in New York.
<p>
The lower court ruled that Abel's six service members' First and
Fifth Amendment rights were violated when the military sought
to discharge them solely based on their admission of homosexuality.
 But as pointed out in the recent <I>Thomasson</I> hearings in
Richmond, Virginia, the military homosexual cases are about the
Clinton Administration's effort to make an end-run around Congress
by defending vague regulations rather than the 1993 law which
clearly excludes homosexuals from military service.
<p>
&quot;The Clinton Administration is doing all it can to put homosexuals
in the military,&quot; said Bob Maginnis, FRC Director of the
Military Readiness Project and a retired Army lieutenant colonel.
&quot;Congress passed the law excluding homosexuals serving in
the military in support of what the American people demanded,
but the Clinton Pentagon has subverted the law with bad implementing
regulations -- many say deliberately creating a legal quagmire.&quot;
<p>
Maginnis continued: &quot;The Clinton Administration wants the
law viewed through the prism of the bad regulations which create
two classes of homosexuals, those who have sex and those who don't.
 But the law presumes and the courts have long affirmed that a
homosexual is one who regularly engages in, or intends to engage
in, same sex activity. While some who struggle with homosexual
temptations may never act on them, there is no such thing as a
chaste homosexual,&quot; Maginnis said.
<p>
&quot;The pro-homosexual Clinton Justice Department has created
a constitutional thicket for the courts by adding to the law what
was never intended.  FRC's brief points out this thicket and calls
for the court to affirm the law and the Pentagon's discharge for
self-avowed homosexuals.&quot;
<p>
Because of <I>Abel's</I> delay, <I>Thomasson v. Perry</I>, another
case on this issue recently heard in the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Fourth Circuit, may reach the Supreme Court before <I>Abel</I>.
FRC presented oral arguments in <I>Thomasson</I> and may have
the opportunity to argue before the highest court in the land
one of the most controversial issues of our day.
<p>
<center><h4>Both Maginnis and Wells-Petry will be available for comment
at the hearing. They also can be reached by contacting the FRC
media office.</h4></center>

<center><h2>FRC APPLAUDS TELECOM BILL<br>
CYBERPORN LANGUAGE,<br>
SAYS LAW PROTECTS MINORS<br>
FROM A &quot;LOADED GUN&quot;</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council applauds the
Telecom Conference Committee's decision to include pornography
restrictions in the Telecommunications Bill.   &quot;Leaving pornography
unrestricted in cyberspace is like leaving a loaded gun in a playground.
The new language will help parents protect their children by making
cyberporn inaccessible by children,&quot; Director of Legal Studies
Cathy Cleaver said.
<p>
Highlights of the cyberporn provisions:
<p><ul>
<li>Use of court-approved &quot;indecency&quot; standard, defined
in the bill as an <B>&quot;image or other communication that,
in context, depicts or describes, in terms patently offensive
as measured by contemporary community standards, sexual or excretory
activities or organs&quot;</B> 
<p>
<li>Indecent communications <B>restricted from children</B>, available
to adults
<p>
<li>People liable only for <B>knowing violations</B> of the law
<p>
<li>Online service providers not liable for violations beyond
areas they own or control
<p>
<li>E-mail privacy laws unchanged
<p>
<li>Those taking good faith efforts to restrict pornography from
children have a defense
</ul><p>
Cleaver noted that, contrary to much of the current rhetoric,
the cyberporn provisions will not find Shakespeare or any other
serious work of literature or library art to be indecent. &quot;Adults
with common sense do not confuse art and literature with patently
offensive materials which degrade women, corrupt children, and
ruin men,&quot; Cleaver said, &quot;and the courts will be obliged
to evaluate material in its proper context.&quot;
<p>
FRC's Assistant to the President for Government Relations Marty
Dannenfelser noted that a few other provisions of the bill are
still unresolved and urged the conferees and the Congressional
leadership to make every effort to conclude these matters as soon
as possible.
<p>
&quot;I hope that both the House and the Senate are able to give
final approval to this important legislation by the end of the
year, so that we do not risk losing the opportunity to protect
our children from the cultural poison of cyberporn,&quot; Dannenfelser
said.

<center><h2>NEW DIVORCE RATES RELEASED</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> The national divorce rate is 4.6,
according to a compilation of new data released today by the Family
Research Council.  In 1994, 4.6 of every 1,000 Americans divorced.
<p>
Massachusetts and Connecticut rank 1st and 2nd, respectively,
for having the lowest divorce rates in the nation.  Both states
experienced a moderate drop in divorce rates between 1992 and
1994 to remain at the top of the list.  Massachusetts fell from
2.8 in 1992 to 2.4 in 1994, while Connecticut fell from 3.1 to
2.8.
<p>
Nevada once again had the highest divorce rate in the country,
even though it experienced the most marked drop in divorce rates
during the two-year period.  Nevada fell from 11.4 in 1992 to
9.0 in 1994.
<p>
Currently, divorce laws in almost every state give greater legal
rights to spouses who want to end the marriage than to spouses
who want to try to work out their marital problems. According
to FRC's 1995 Family Issues Survey, 55 percent of the American
public want to see these laws modified to offer greater protection
to spouses interested in saving the marriage.  &quot;Clearly divorce
reform is an issue that needs to be addressed at the state level,&quot;
said Gary L. Bauer, president of the Family Research Council.

<center><h2>NEW ILLEGITIMACY RATES RELEASED</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Thirty-one percent of all births in
the U.S. are to unmarried women, according to a compilation of
new data released today by the Family Research Council.
<p>
&quot;Most Americans believe preventing out-of-wedlock pregnancy
is a realistic goal,&quot; said FRC president Gary Bauer.  He
cited findings from FRC's 1995 Family Issues Survey showing that
most Americans actually have greater hope for illegitimacy prevention
programs than for workfare programs designed to move single mothers
off welfare.
<p>
In addition, FRC's poll showed that most Americans consider &quot;putting
the child up for adoption&quot; and &quot;marrying the child's
father&quot; to be better responses to an unwed pregnancy than
single motherhood.  A clear majority -- 55 percent -- say abortion
is the &quot;worst&quot; response to an unwed pregnancy, Bauer
said.
<p>
The state with the lowest percentage of births to unmarried women
is Utah, with 15.5 percent.  Like Utah, most other states with
low illegitimacy ratios are sparsely-populated states west of
the Mississippi River.  East of the Mississippi, only Vermont
and New Hampshire show a ratio of less than 25 percent of births
to unmarried women.  
<p>
Of the 50 states and the District of Columbia, 10 states have
illegitimacy ratios at or above 35 percent.  All of these states,
with the exception of New York, are along the southern rim of
the 48 contiguous states.

<center><h2>ABEL JUDGE PULLS OUT OF CASE<br>
GOOD NEWS FOR FAMILIES, SAYS FRC</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> When Family Research Council staff got to
the New York court on Tuesday where the <I>Abel et al v. William
Perry </I>was being heard, they were prepared to hear arguments
about six service members' discharges on the basis of admission
of homosexuality. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit
in New York City was the next stop for the case which could go
on to the Supreme Court. 
<p>
However, at the last minute, Judge Guido Calabresi recused himself
from the case because of a letter he had written in favor of a
more liberal position than the law at the time set out. Court
watchers said that the judge pulled out after the Justice Department
reminded him of the letter. Since there were only two judges left
to hear the case, rather than the three needed, the hearing had
to be postponed.
<p>
&quot;This is very good news for pro-family Americans,&quot; FRC
Director of the Military Readiness Project Robert Maginnis said,
directly after the hearing. &quot;The New York court is not expected
to be as favorable to the view of most Americans, the law and
military experience -- the view that homosexuals should not be
allowed to serve in the military because of the problems their
presence cause.&quot;
<p>
&quot;Abel was one of two cases on this issue making its way toward
the Supreme Court. The other, <i>Thomasson v. Perry</i>, was heard
recently in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit,
and Family Research Council presented oral arguments. Now, Thomasson
may very well make it to the Supreme Court first, and Family Research
Council could argue before the highest court in the land one of
the most controversial issues of our day.
<p>
&quot;The Clinton Administration has not been making the case
that has traditionally fallen to the government -- the case for
a strong military force, free from a sexually charged environment.
It is critical that a fighting force be able to work as a team
without the complications of sexual politics.&quot;

<center><h2>ABEL CASE DOES END-RUN AROUND THE LAW,<br>
SET FOR TUESDAY HEARING IN NEW YORK</h2></center>
<p>
<b>Washington, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council, a national
leader in the battle opposing homosexuals in the military, filed
this summer a friend of the court brief in the <I>Abel et al v.
William Perry</I> federal case which is scheduled for arguments
on Dec. 19.  Either this case or the 4th Circuit's <I>Thomasson
v. Perry</I> case is expected to reach the Supreme Court next
year.  Family Research Council will be at the U.S. Court of Appeal
for the Second Circuit in New York City when the case will be
heard, and experts will be available for comment.
<p>
The lower court ruled that Abel's six service members' First and
Fifth Amendment rights were violated when the military sought
to discharge them solely based on their admission of homosexuality.
 But as pointed out in the recent Thomasson hearings in Richmond,
Virginia, the military homosexual cases are about the Clinton
Administration's effort to make an end-run around Congress by
defending vague regulations rather than the 1993 law which clearly
excludes homosexuals from military service.
<p>
&quot;The Clinton Administration is doing all it can to put homosexuals
in the military,&quot; said Bob Maginnis, FRC Director of the
Military Readiness Project and a retired Army lieutenant colonel
 &quot;Congress passed the law excluding homosexuals serving in
the military in support of what the American people demanded,
but the Clinton Pentagon has subverted the law with bad implementing
regulations -- many say deliberately creating a legal quagmire.&quot;
<p>
Maginnis continued: &quot;The Clinton Administration wants the
law viewed through the prism of the bad regulations which create
two classes of homosexuals, those who have sex and those who don't.
 But the law presumes and the courts have long affirmed that a
homosexual is one who regularly engages in, or intends to engage
in, same sex activity. While some who struggle with homosexual
temptations may never act on them, there is not such thing as
a chaste homosexual,&quot; Maginnis said. 
<p>
&quot;Feeling pulled to do something is not the defining issue.
A person who is tempted to shop lift when a clerk's back is turned
is not a thief. A thief is the person who acts on that temptation
or who enters the store looking for an opportunity to steal,&quot;
Maginnis said.
<p>
&quot;The pro-homosexual Clinton Justice Department has created
a constitutional thicket for the courts by adding to the law what
was never intended.  FRC's brief points out this thicket and calls
for the court to affirm the law and the Pentagon's discharge for
self-avowed homosexuals.&quot;
<p>
After the hearing, a ruling could be expected sometime between
March and May, Maginnis said. The brief was written by Melissa Wells-Petry, 
counsel for FRC's Military Readiness Project. 
<p>
<b>Both Maginnis and Wells-Petry will be available for comment
at the hearing. They also will be reachable by calling the FRC
media.</b>

<center><h2>CLINTON'S JUSTICE DEPARTMENT USES<br>
SUPREME COURT TO PROMOTE<br>
ANTI-FAMILY AGENDA</h2></center>
<p>
<b>Washington, D.C. --</b> Today, the Family Research Council
filed a friend of the court brief in the Supreme Court case of
<I> U.S. v. Commonwealth of Virginia</I> (the Virginia Military
Institute). FRC Policy Analyst Bob Maginnis noted that &quot;in
this case, the Clinton Administration is promoting a radical agenda
that would enact the goals of the failed Equal Rights Amendment
without a vote.&quot;   Oral arguments are set for January 17,
1996.
<p>
Clinton's Justice Department goes well beyond the issue of whether
single-sex public colleges should be legal.  According to the
government's brief, Clinton wants the high court to impose a &quot;strict
scrutiny&quot; test which would make all classifications by gender
very hard to defend legally.  With high court approval, this would
be a back door to the Equal Rights Amendment reviving old debates
about Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, homosexual marriage and unisex
bathrooms.
<p>
The brief was written by Melissa Wells-Petry, counsel to FRC's
Military Readiness Project.
<p>
&quot;Ironically, this case would strike its hardest blow on women's
institutions,&quot;  Wells-Petry said. &quot;Single-sex schools
for women number 87, compared to two all-male partially state-supported
schools. Educators working with both sexes have long appreciated
that for some girls and some boys, a single-sex education provides
unique benefits. We can include the First Lady and a quarter of
the female members of Congress among leading Americans who are
single-sex education alumni.&quot;
<p>
The government's Supreme Court brief states, &quot;The long history
of discrimination against women, the general irrelevance of sex
as a ground for official decision-making, and women's continuing
under representation in government, all support the application
of strict scrutiny here.&quot;   This ignores differences between
men and women which were cited in the VMI hearings and helped
defeat the ERA.
<p>
The Clinton Administration appealed the decision by the U.S. Court
of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit  which accepted Virginia's proposal
to offer a military-style alternative at Mary Baldwin College
in Stauton, Virginia.  The government claims that  the 1976 forced
integration of women at the service academies shows that &quot;the
admission of women into a rigorous, military-style educational
program does not impair any governmental interest in producing
military personnel, let alone 'citizen-soldiers.'&quot; 
<p>
&quot;Accepting this 'evidence' will seriously erode female combat
exemptions and may subject women to a future combat draft,&quot;
said Maginnis, a retired Army lieutenant colonel.
<p>
Drew Days, III, Clinton's solicitor general, argues &quot;that
strict scrutiny is, in fact, the correct constitutional standard
for evaluating differences in official treatment based on sex.&quot;
 Strict scrutiny applies to racial classifications challenged
under the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution.  It requires
the defendant to prove that any race-based classification is narrowly
tailored to achieve a compelling government objective.  But the
color of a person's skin and sex are different spheres.
<p>
Looking at legal precedents, Maginnis noted, &quot;A strict scrutiny
finding in this case could eliminate single-sex education, permit
homosexual adoption and marriage, prohibit single-gender sports
and even make single-sex prisons unconstitutional.&quot;

<center><h2>IT'S TIME WE KNEW  WHAT HAPPENED TO THE<br>
CHILDREN OF TABLE 34</h2>
<p>
<h4>Family Research Council calls on Congress to support the Child
Protection and Ethics in Education Act of 1995</h4></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;Fresh examination of the full
range of erroneous and fraudulent findings in the Kinsey research
is long overdue,&quot; Family Research Council Director of Cultural
Studies Robert H. Knight said Thursday in a news conference to
unveil the Child Protection and Ethics in Education Act of 1995.
Knight made his comments in the 11:30 a.m.  news conference at
2222 Rayburn as Rep. Steve Stockman (R-TX) presented the legislation.
<p>
Mr. Knight made the following statement:
<p>
&quot;Family Research Council commends Rep. Stockman  and the
approximately 40 cosponsors on the introduction of The Child Protection
and Ethics in Education Act of 1995, a bill designed to resolve
unanswered questions about the ethics and scientific integrity
of the sex studies by Alfred C. Kinsey in the 1940s and '50s.
 Despite the flaws identified by early critics of the Kinsey methodology 
and findings, the twin studies Kinsey's team authored,
on male and female sexuality, continue to provide a pseudo-intellectual
foundation for social change that has proven deeply injurious
to children and families.&quot;
<p>
&quot;The 1990 book <I>Kinsey, Sex and Fraud</I> by Judith Reisman,
Ph. D., and Edward Eichel, M.A. (Drs. Gordon Muir and John Court,
eds.) revealed a variety of serious problems with the Kinsey research.
 According to scientific fraud specialist Dr. Walter Stewart of
the National Research Council, evidence of these problems is 'compelling
. . . disturbing . . . and requires investigation.'  A review
of Kinsey, Sex and Fraud in the British medical journal The <I>Lancet</I>
concluded that the book 'demolish[es]' the foundations of the
Kinsey research, which The <I>Lancet</I> editors concluded was
'unethical [and] possibly criminal.&quot;
<p>
&quot;The<I> Lancet's</I> characterization of portions of the
research as 'possibly criminal' is based on the inclusion in the
male study of several tables compiled from information obtained
by 'nine' pedophiles.  Table 34 reports the results of orgasm
produced by adults in infants as young as a few months old.  The
current director of the Kinsey Institute, Dr. John Bancroft, now
says that there was but one pedophile engaged in this infant molestation,
but the Institute has refused to reveal his name, the names of
his child and infant victims, or anything else about the circumstances
under which this data was obtained and published.  These and other
key questions must be resolved now.&quot;
<p>
&quot;The introduction of The Child Protection and Ethics in Education
Act today takes a significant step forward in the effort to learn the full 
truth about the Kinsey research.  Given what we already know, it is unimaginable
that any reputable scientific study, any curriculum, or any public
policy today would be based on this work.  The American people
deserve a full accounting of the role that Kinsey played -- and
is still playing -- in molding the sexual ethics of our nation
and its children.&quot;

<center><h4><i>* MEDIA ADVISORY *</i></h4>
<p>
<h3>STOCKMAN BILL TO ADDRESS:</h3>
<p>
<h2>DOES DATA FROM MOLESTED<br>
CHILDREN SHAPE MOST SEX<br>
EDUCATION PROGRAMS?</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council will lend its
full support to the Child Protection and Ethics in Education Act
of 1995 to be announced by Rep. Steve Stockman (R-TX) in a news
conference <B>Thursday, Dec.7 at 11:30 a.m. in 2222 Rayburn</B>.
<p>
The bill's purpose is &quot;to determine if Alfred Kinsey's 'Sexual
Behavior in the Human Male' and/or 'Sexual Behavior in the Human
Female' are the result of any fraud or criminal wrongdoing.&quot;
 If such is found, the Congress will &quot;require an in-depth
study be performed to determine if Kinsey and his fellow researchers
employed systematic sexual abuse of children to obtain the data
tabulated in 'Table 34' and other portions of the study,&quot;
the bill states. 
<p>
The bill would also require the Government Accounting Office (GAO)
to study whether federal agencies and schools have used tax monies
to promote information on sexual behavior based upon &quot;erroneous,
fraudulent&quot; research.
<p>
FRC Director of Cultural Studies Bob Knight wrote and directed
a 30-minute documentary, &quot;The Children of Table 34,&quot;
investigating Kinsey's studies.
<p>
Knight said, &quot;After looking at the video, people are compelled
to ask, did the researchers lie about their findings, or were
children actually molested in the name of science?  It's a frightening
story, but it doesn't stop there. This research is central to
current thought on sex education for our children today.&quot;

<center><h2>STOP EFFORTS TO REPLACE MOM &amp; DAD<br>
WITH BIG BROTHER, CLEAVER SAYS</h2>
<p>
<h4>PARENTAL RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES ACT OF 1995 ON DECK<br>
AT 10 AM HEARING, DIRKSEN 226</h4></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> In the growing struggle of parents
versus the government in a war over who decides for America's
children, &quot;the need for federal legislation is becoming increasingly
apparent,&quot; said Cathy Cleaver, Director of Legal Studies
for Family Research Council, on Tuesday.
<p>
Miss Cleaver spoke on behalf of parents and in support of the
1995 Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act (H.R. 1946, S. 984).
During the 10 am hearing, Family Research Council applauded the
efforts of Senator Charles Grassley (R-IA) and  Rep. Steve Largent
(R-OK) in sponsoring the act because &quot;this is a good step
toward  restoring the rights of parents to direct the upbringing
and education of their children.&quot;
<p>
In support of parents, Miss Cleaver related the following:
<p>
&quot;Consider the following: this summer, Mr. and Mrs. Waymon
Earls of Georgia were shocked to find a bag of condoms in their
13- and 15-year old daughters' room.  After repeated inquiries
of the school superintendent, they found that a school counselor
had driven the girls during school hours to a health clinic where
they were tested for AIDS and cervical cancer, and given condoms
and prescriptions for birth control pills.  Mr. And Mrs. Earls
have not been allowed to see the results of their daughters' tests.
 This type of 'parenting' by agents of the state must stop.&quot;
<p>
&quot;Tragically, there are cases of abuse and neglect that the
government agencies must address.  This legislation continues
to allow the government to intervene when it has a compelling
interest to do so.&quot;
<p>
&quot;Stable, intact families rearing children with both love
and direction have never been in shorter supply or more desperately
needed. Let's stop replacing Mom and Dad with Big Brother, and
pass the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act.&quot;

<center><h2>FAMILY RESEARCH COUNCIL ARGUES TO<br>
UPHOLD 1993 LAW ON<br>
HOMOSEXUALS IN THE MILITARY</h2>
<p>
<h4><i>THOMASSON v. PERRY</i><br>
HEARD IN U.S. COURT OF APPEALS, 4TH CIRCUIT</h4></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council presents oral
arguments today in a landmark case in which the U.S. Court of
Appeals, 4th Circuit will consider the constitutionality of the
Clinton's Administration's homosexual policy as an interpretation
of the 1993 law passed by Congress excluding homosexuals from
military service. FRC Attorney Melissa Wells-Petry, former Army
lawyer who has litigated the military's ban on homosexuals for
years, submitted friend-of-the-court arguments to the effect that
the dismissal from the Navy of Lt-Paul G. Thomasson, a self-identified
homosexual, should be upheld.
<p>
Technically, FRC and the Clinton Justice Department will be on
the same side of this case, however their arguments differ greatly.
The Justice Department opposes FRC's arguments, based on the intent
of the law passed by Congress, and submitted a brief attacking
their participation.  The Justice Department rests their case
on, and as their brief states, has a &quot;paramount interest
in defending the validity of Directives&quot; issued to implement
the law.
<p>
Family Research Council analyst Lt. Col. Robert Maginnis says
the recent opposition  indicates that &quot;the Justice Department's
primary motive is to uphold Clinton's promise to the homosexual
community rather than to defend a law in the military's best interests.&quot;
<p>
&quot;We hope the court will declare the regulations unconstitutional
and sustain the law of the land,&quot; Maginnis said. &quot;It
would be a tremendous act on behalf of the men and women who put
their lives on the line for their nation daily. They deserve to
serve in an environment that does not put them in unnecessarily
intimate and intrusive circumstances.&quot; 
<p>
Maginnis anticipates the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals to refer
the case to the Supreme Court.

<h2>FRC TO PRESENT ARGUMENTS IN<br>
LANDMARK CASE, <I>THOMASSON v. PERRY</I></h2>
<p>
<h3>U.S. COURT OF APPEALS, 4TH CIRCUIT TO HEAR<br>
CASE ON HOMOSEXUALS IN THE MILITARY</h3></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> In a rare occasion, Family Research
Council will present arguments on why the 1993 law excluding homosexuals
from the military should be upheld during a Tuesday, December
5 hearing.  FRC Attorney Melissa Wells-Petry, a former Army attorney
who litigated the military's ban on homosexuals, will defend the
law in the landmark case of <I>Thomasson v. Perry</I> before the
U.S. Court of Appeals, 4th Circuit, in Richmond, Va.
<p>
FRC will be in the position of defending the law passed by Congress,
and the Clinton Administration's Justice Department will take
the more liberal position of building their case on the Department
of Defense regulations implemented to enact the law.
<p>
According to Family Research Council analyst Lt. Col. Robert Maginnis,
the confusion between the law and Clinton's &quot;Don't Ask/Don't
Tell&quot; policy is a strategy designed to lead to litigation.
<p>
&quot;Military people support the ban and so do the American people,&quot;
Maginnis said. 
<p>
A survey by the American Security Council Foundation found that
99% of active duty officers said homosexuals would undermine the
cohesiveness and readiness of combat units.

landmark case of <I>Thomasson v. Perry </I>before the U.S. Court
of Appeals, 4th Circuit, in Richmond, Va.
<p>
To the surprise of court watchers, the Appeals Court granted
FRC's request to address them -- despite the objections of the
Department of Justice and attorneys for Thomasson, a self-identified
homosexual serving in the military. Ironically, Family Research
Council will be in the position of actually defending the law
-- which would seem to be the province of the Justice Department.
However, the Clinton Administration's Justice Department has taken
the more liberal position of building their case on the regulations
implemented to enact the law.
<P>
According to Family Research Council analyst Robert Maginnis,
from the beginning of the &quot;Don't Ask/Don't Tell&quot; policy,
 the strategy of the Clinton Administration  has been to set up
a confusing situation between the law and the regulations.
<p>
<B>&quot;The confusion was designed to lead to ligitation,&quot;
Maginnis said.</B>
<p>
&quot;We hope the court will declare the regulations unconstitutional
and sustain the law of the land,&quot; Maginnis said. &quot;It
would be a tremendous act on behalf of the men and women who put
their lives on the line for their nation daily. They deserve to
serve in an environment that does not put them in unnecessarily
intimate and intrusive circumstances.&quot;

<center><h4><i>* MEDIA ADVISORY* </i></h4>
<p>
<h2>SENATE RESUMES DEBATE ON</br>
PARTIAL-BIRTH ABORTION BILL</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> The U.S. Senate is expected to resume
debate on the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act (HR 1833) as early
as Monday, December 4.  Family Research Council supports the partial-birth
abortion ban and will oppose any weakening amendments to the bill.
<p>
The Senate voted November 7 to refer the bill to the Judiciary
committee for a public hearing. On November 17, the Senate Judiciary
Committee held a hearing to educate the Senators about this procedure.
 Senators heard dramatic testimony from a number of witnesses
including the President of the American Society of Anesthesiologists,
Dr. Ellison. Delivering key testimony, Ellison dispelled the claim
of an abortionist who testified last summer before a House subcommittee,
that anesthesia given to the mother as part of the procedure protects
the fetus from pain, and that it causes &quot;brain death&quot;
in the fetus. Others testifying about the procedure were former
abortion nurse Brenda Shafer, Dr. Pamela Smith, Dr. Nancy Romer,
Helen Alvare, Jeannie Wallace French, and Professor Douglas Kmiec.
No amendments were offered to the bill, and it automatically returned
to the Senate &quot;calendar&quot; November 28. 
<p>
As early as Monday, December 4th, Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole
(R-KS) and Senator Bob Smith (R-NH), the prime sponsor of the
bill, may take up the House-passed bill on the Senate floor. 
<p>
The House has already voted overwhelmingly on November 1 to pass
the bill by more than a 2-1 margin (288-139).  In the Senate,
it is expected that the bill will receive support from a diverse
group of senators with various histories on pro-life votes.  FRC
will be urging Senators to oppose a series of misleading amendments
designed to gut the substance of the legislation.

<center><h2>FEDERALLY-FUNDED &quot;SAFE SEX&quot;<br>
COMMERCIALS SEND WRONG MESSAGE<br>
TO TEENS</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council Policy Analyst
Gracie Hsu made the following statement in response to the new
&quot;safe sex&quot; public service announcements released today
by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS):
<p>
<B>Flawed premise</B> -- &quot;The Family Research Council (FRC)
finds the HHS ads irresponsible in that all the ads -- with the
exception of the abstinence ad -- begin with the flawed premise
that there is nothing wrong or harmful about teenagers having
sex as long as they use a condom.  The truth is, out-of-wedlock
sex is harmful in and of itself, regardless if a condom is used:
 broken hearts, emotional regret, and greatly increased likelihood
to divorce are just some of the consequences of pre-marital sex.&quot;
<p>
<B>Doomed for failure</B> -- &quot;These ads are doomed for failure.
 Research clearly shows that condom-based approaches actually
increase the likelihood that teenagers will initiate sex.  The
only approach that has proven to be effective in protecting young
people is abstinence.  The problem with these ads is that, when
they crash and burn, they'll likely take a whole host of young
people with them.&quot;
<p>
<B>Irresponsible use of federal funds</B> -- &quot;When public
opinion polls show that a majority of adults <b>and</b> teenagers
believe that it is best to save sex for marriage, it is irresponsible
for the federal government to be using taxpayer dollars to give
its imprimatur for teens to have sex.&quot;
<p>
<B>Undermines parents</B> -- &quot;The ads, clearly aimed at teenagers
and 'Generation X,' undermine what most parents want for their
children.  These ads undercut the message that most parents explicitly
or implicitly relate to their children that sex should be saved
until marriage.&quot;
<p>
<B>FRC's position</B> -- &quot;FRC is, and always has been, committed
to protecting young people from the negative consequences of early
sexual activity (i.e., out-of-wedlock pregnancy, abortion, AIDS,
and other sexually-transmitted diseases), and to promoting the
positive benefits of saving sex for marriage (i.e., more stable
marriages, greater sexual satisfaction, fewer infertility problems).
 FRC has been a leader in educating young people about the benefits
of abstinence and heartily endorses other efforts which help strengthen
the resolve of young people to wait until marriage to have sex.&quot;

<center><h2>FRC WILL FIGHT FOR MILITARY<br>
LAW IN FEDERAL COURT</h2></center>
<p>
<b>Washington, D.C. --</b> The Family Research Council will defend
the military's homosexual law before the 4th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals on December 5.   This rare privilege comes after extensive
FRC work in articulating a case about the real impacts of  the
radical homosexual agenda in the military.
<p>
Robert Maginnis, FRC's Military Readiness Project director and
a retired Army lieutenant colonel, announced on Tuesday that the
4th Circuit which sits in Richmond, Virginia, approved FRC's motion
to make oral arguments in the case of Navy Lt. Paul G. Thomasson.
 <b>This is the first challenge to President Clinton's &quot;don't
ask, don't tell&quot; policy expected to reach the Supreme Court
next year.</b>
<p>
Mr. Thomasson, who worked for the admiral administering &quot;don't
ask, don't tell,&quot; told his commander about his sexual orientation
days after the policy went into effect.  After the Navy moved
to discharge him, he challenged the policy in federal court and
lost.  
<p>
Melissa Wells-Petry, a former Army litigator and now representing
FRC, will argue that the White House and Pentagon failed to follow
a newly enacted law when writing the &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot;
policy.  The law, enacted by Congress and signed by President
Clinton, bars homosexuals from serving in the military.  But the
regulations allow homosexuals to serve as long as they keep their
orientation private.
<p>
Mrs. Wells-Petry explains, &quot;They're definitely trying to
do what I call 'the wink' in the regulations as opposed to a clear-cut
rule.  They're trying to put as a matter of policy, 'We're going
to wink at it until it becomes flagrant.'  In our view it's just
not a workable policy.&quot;
<p>
The Military Readiness Project has aggressively filed amicus briefs
in most homosexual military cases because, as Colonel Maginnis
says, &quot;The Clinton Administration is ignoring the law and
trying to erase centuries of prudent policy in favor of allowing
homosexuals to serve in the military.&quot; 
<p>
FRC's team will join a three-sided argument with the Justice Department
defending the regulations, Mr. Thomasson's attorney asking that
the law and the policy be ruled unconstitutional and the Military
Readiness Project defending the law.
<p>
In accepting FRC's motion for oral argument, the Court acknowledges
that there is &quot;extraordinary&quot; justification for a third
party to argue.  The extraordinary situation exists because neither
the government or Thomasson is addressing the right issue.

<center><h4>ANNOUNCING FRC'S NEW T.V. SHOW:</h4>
<p>
<h2><i>&quot;STRAIGHT TALK</i><br>
FROM THE FAMILY RESEARCH COUNCIL&quot;</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council this month
launched a new one hour television program called, &quot;Straight
Talk from the Family Research Council,&quot; on National Empowerment
Television (NET), a cable Political NewsTalk Network. Every Wednesday
at 8 p.m., the show airs cutting edge news stories, fast-paced
discussions and commentary by President Gary Bauer, Director of
Communications Kristi Hamrick, and guest appearances by FRC policy
analysts, members of Congress, and leaders of the pro-family movement.
<p>
The show includes many different segments, such as &quot;Behind
the Headlines,&quot; an insider's look at what is happening to
the family in Washington, and &quot;Homefront News,&quot; a highlight
of what FRC has been doing to bolster the family.
<p>
Each show tackles a single issue from many sides. Topics include:
what original FRC polling shows about Americans, welfare reform,
tainted sex research, and more. 
<p>
An exciting new venture for FRC, &quot;Straight Talk&quot; reaches
into more than 11 million homes. &quot;Our dream of providing
a pro-family voice is much bigger than merely building a conservative
'speed bump' in a vast terrain of liberal reporting,&quot; Gary
Bauer said. &quot;Our vision is to help a national audience understand
not only what we believe but why we support the kind of pro-family
reforms that we advocate daily in Washington. Our aim is to make
a connection with even more of those millions of Americans who
go to work every morning worrying about the kind of world their
children are inheriting.&quot;
<p>
To learn whether your cable company carries NET: Check local listings
or call your cable carrier. If you have a satellite dish, NET
can be reached on Galaxy 7, Transponder 20. <B>Beginning December
1st, NET will change settings to Galaxy 6, Transponder 7.</B>

<center><b>SENATE SENDS PARTIAL-BIRTH TO COMMITTEE:<br>
<font size=+2>IT'S A TIME FOR EDUCATION, SAYS BAUER<br>
<p>
<i>AND: MEDIA ADVISORY FOR THURSDAY HEARING.</i></font></b></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;Pro-family Americans support
the vote today because it allows more time to better educate the
Senators about this inhumane procedure,&quot; Family Research
Council President Gary Bauer said Wednesday after the Senators
voted to recommit the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act to the Senate
Judiciary Committee.  A hearing will be scheduled in committee
in the next nineteen days.
<p>
&quot;As we saw in the historic vote in the House, with members
on both side of the abortion issue voting for the ban, our representatives
acknowledged that there are limits to what can be done to the
unborn. A procedure that pulls a child into the birth canal so
that his or her brain tissue can be sucked out is blatantly unacceptable.&quot;
<p>
&quot;This ban will not affect women whose lives are in danger.
The bill is clear. And the additional time will allow the Senate
to fully consider what is being done to some children moments
before birth.&quot;
<p>
<b>MEDIA ADVISORY: FRC Director of Cultural Studies Robert Knight
will testify 9:30 a.m. Thursday before the Senate Governmental
Affairs Committee, SD-342. TOPIC: The Family Privacy Act. The
bill would require the approval of at least one parent before
a minor could respond to surveys or questionnaires from federally
funded programs.</b>

<center><h2>FRC TESTIFIES IN FAVOR OF A<br>
RELIGIOUS LIBERTY AMENDMENT</h2>
<p>
<b>HEARING AT 10 A.M. IN SENATE DIRKSEN - ROOM 226</b></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> At a hearing today in the Senate Judiciary
Committee, Family Research Council Director of Legal Studies Cathy
Cleaver said the following in favor of a religious liberty amendment
to the Constitution:
<p>
&quot;The Religious Liberty Amendment could be thought of as the
religious 'neutrality' amendment.  This principle of neutrality
is not new -- it is the aim and result of our First Amendment's
religion clauses properly understood.  A Religious Liberty Amendment
could restore this saving principle, so that our First Amendment
would not be used to promote the empty state religion of secularism,
but to promote true freedom, and the prospect of freedom's fulfillment
in truth, to which every American is entitled.&quot;

<center><h4>** MEDIA ADVISORY **</h4>
<p>
<h2>KINSEY SEX STUDIES ARE TOPIC OF<br>
FOCUS ON THE FAMILY BROADCAST</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> On Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday
of this week, &quot;Focus on the Family,&quot; a radio show reaching
over one million listeners with Dr. Dobson and guest Robert Knight,
Family Research Council Director of Cultural Studies, will discuss,
&quot;What happened to children in the sex studies conducted at
the Kinsey Institute on Indiana University's campus in the 1940's?&quot;
<p>
<I>The Children of Table 34, </I>a video that FRC released this
fall after three years of research and production, prompted the
broadcast. This video investigates the circumstances and people
involved in collecting the data that is revealed in Alfred C.
Kinsey's reports in 1948, <I>Sexual Behavior in the Human Male
</I>and in 1953, <I>Sexual Behavior in the Human Female</I>. 
<p>
FRC has repeated attempts to confront the Kinsey Institute with
questions regarding this study.  Recent controversies surrounding
the study include the Institute's claim that the data gathered
for this report originated from one anonymous man. 
<p>
Knight, who wrote and directed FRC's video, said, &quot;Kinsey's
sex studies have been used as the scientific basis to justify
everything from condom distribution in schools to teaching children
how to masturbate. If indeed this influential data was gathered
by one man who molested children ages two months and up, something
must be done by the new Congress to examine this horrific, scientific
experiment and to change the course of sex education as we know
it today.&quot;

<center><h2><i>ROMER V. EVANS</i>: THE IMPACT OF A CLINTON PRESIDENCY?</h2></center>
<p>
<B>WASHINGTON, D.C.</b> -- &quot;Today, pro-family Americans saw
a powerful repercussion of the Clinton Presidency,&quot; Family
Research Council attorney Melissa Wells-Petry said Tuesday, following
oral arguments in the homosexual related case <I>Romer v. Evans</I>.
&quot;Justices Ginsberg and Breyer, Clinton appointees,  led the
charge against the people of Colorado in the Supreme Court hearing
on the contentious Amendment 2 case.&quot;
<P>
Wells-Petry filed a &quot;friend-of-the-court&quot; brief on behalf
of Family Research Council and attended the oral arguments. Her
involvement follows on the heels of FRC Director of Communications
Robert Knight who testified at the trial court level on behalf
of the people of Colorado's right to make a democratically agreed
upon statement about homosexuality.
<P>
In the brief before the Supreme Court, Wells-Petry argued that
to throw out Amendment 2 and overthrow the people of Colorado's
decision was to cut off democratic options, such as legal referendum,
and make homosexuality the law of the land. 
<P>
The Clinton administration appointees were clearly aggressive
in their questioning of the   people of Colorado, Wells-Petry
noted. She made the following statement:
<P>
&quot;The Clinton appointees used 80% of the air time during the
one-hour hearing.  They sat in super judgment of the people of
 Colorado, apparently undisturbed at the prospect of substituting
their judgment for that of the over 1,524,000 Colorodans who exercised
their constitutional right to vote on this issue.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Moreover, these two justices in particular seemed completely
unconcerned about the implications, both for the law and society,
of 'discovering' a new fundamental right that obviously was created
to award homosexuals special rights even though homosexuality
does not fall under established legal analyses of classes requiring
special protection.  In fact, in this very case the lower court
held that homosexuals are not a suspect class.&quot;
<P>
&quot;In short, during oral arguments before the high court, little
was said about the bizarre impact this case could have on the
democratic process.&quot;
<P>
&quot;We have seen the future of a Clinton court,&quot; Wells-Petry
said. &quot;This is another wake up call on the implications of
the presidency. How many justices will be nominated by the next
president?  It's time for a national conversation on whether Americans
want the right to vote on the laws of the land, or to allow liberal
judges to overrule democratic decisions.&quot;

<i><font size=6><b>ROMER v. EVANS</font></i><br>
<font size=5>&quot;The Case of the Decade&quot;</font></b>
<p>
<h2>MORAL IMPLICATIONS OF SUPREME COURT<br>
DECISION WOULD RESEMBLE <i>ROE v. WADE</i></h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C.</b> -- When the U.S. Supreme Court hears arguments
for <I>Romer v. Evans </I>on October 10, it could be a historical
moment, as sweeping as <I>Roe v. Wade</I>.   Attorney Melissa
Wells-Petry, a former Army major and author of <i>Exclusion: Homosexuals
and The Right To Serve</i>, has submitted a &quot;friend of the
court&quot; brief, and has noted that this decision mirrors <I>Roe
v. Wade</I> in that &quot;it would present the same risk for public
policy disaster by foreclosing political choice.&quot; 
<p>
When the court in Colorado struck down Amendment 2, it said that
homosexuality cannot be the subject of negative public regulation,
even regulation by omission.  
<p>
In her brief, Wells-Petry said that such a decision from the U.S.
Supreme Court would provide homosexuals with &quot;'easy money'
-- a new constitutional right -- with which to buy a result they
did not earn in the marketplace of ideas. This new right allows
homosexuals to circumvent the process of obtaining a consensus
for their ideas in that marketplace of ideas. It allows homosexuals
to insulate their ideas from that market's ebb and flow.  Indeed,
no matter what ideas homosexuals advance, people never can use
the ballot box affirmatively to reject those ideas.&quot; 
<p>
Wells-Petry warned the court that such a &quot;tremendous change
in the functioning of our democracy&quot; would have as severe
an impact on society as did <I>Roe</I>. &quot;The social, political,
and jurisprudential ramifications of the judicial overreaching
of <I>Roe</I> must not be repeated through the creation of a new
fundamental right in <I>Romer,</I>&quot; Wells-Petry stated.
<p>
FRC Director of Cultural Studies Robert H. Knight testified at
the trial in Colorado and said that a gay rights ordinance violates
the free speech clause of the First Amendment of the Constitution.
 The implications of this decision would be felt across society.
FRC  Policy Analyst retired Army Lt. Col. Robert L. Maginnis stated
that this decision would even affect the military and its policy.

<title>Daily Commentary - December 3, 1996</title>

December 3, 1996</h1></center>

I'm Gary Bauer for Washington Watch.

<p>

While you and I were enjoying our Thanksgiving turkey, a
judge in California was busy putting Proposition 209 on the chopping
block.  Through Prop. 209, California voters dismantled the state's
system of racial preferences in hiring and college admissions.
The judge issued what's called a &quot;temporary restraining
order,&quot; keeping the racial spoils system in place for now.
He claimed that Prop. 209 probably violates the 14th amendment's
guarantee of equal protection.  But that's exactly what Prop.
209 <i>does</i> guarantee:  equal protection for all citizens
regardless of race or gender.

<p>

Now whatever you think of affirmative action itself, this
case is yet another example of judicial tyranny.  In Colorado,
it was a ban on special rights for homosexuals.  In Washington
state, a law against assisted suicide.  In each case, the courts
overturned the will of the people on a hotly contested issue.
The real question we must ask is:  how can self-government survive
as our courts shrink our liberty?  To answer that question is
to determine the fate of our republic.

<p>

After months of delay, Hollywood's television executives
have come up with a plan to protect your children from sex and
violence on the tube.  But don't celebrate yet..  Because, unfortunately,
the only thing it will protect is the big-time producers' ratings.

<p>

In essence, what Hollywood proposes is something like the
current movie rating system.  Each television show would carry
a simple code pegged to the age of the viewer that Hollywood considers
appropriate for each program.  Well!  I'm not impressed.  I just
don't trust Hollywood's opinion of its own product.  Most parents
want to know what a program actually contains.  Does it include
profanity?  Violence or nudity?  Homosexual characters and themes?
Parents want this information before they sit down to watch,
or let their children watch, a program.

<p>

Last spring, President Clinton met with television executives
to encourage them to come up with a system to safeguard families.
After so many months, Hollywood has responded with a dud.  This
is one premiere that deserves a swift cancellation.

<p>

December 5, 1996</h1></center>

<p><hr width=75% size=3><p>

I'm Gary Bauer for Washington Watch.

<p>

The year's not over yet, but here's my award for most cynical:
Those liberals in Congress and out who denounced the Defense of
Marriage Act.  &quot;It's years away,&quot; they said of homosexual
marriage. &quot;Nobody's legalizing this,&quot; they said.  Conservatives
are &quot;jumping the gun,&quot; they charged.

<p>

Guess what. Hawaii's Supreme Court has just ruled that gay marriage
is legal in the Aloha State.  Pro-gay Bill Clinton has been safely
re-elected.  And the same people who denounced the Defense of
Marriage Act have forgotten everything they said just a few months
ago.  Then, Clinton's spokeswoman said he &quot;scorned&quot;
the Defense of Marriage bill -- even as he signed it. And the
press sure scorned it.

<p>

But events in Hawaii prove how timely, how important, how <I>needed</I> 
the Defense of Marriage Act was.  This fight is not over.
We will not give in.  The overwhelming majority of people in
America -- and in Hawaii itself -- <I>oppose</I> homosexual marriage.
The more people find out about it, the more strongly they want
to defend true marriage. Remember, what the radical homosexuals
really want is not marriage for them, but the <I>end</I> of marriage
for everyone.

<p>

<title>Daily Commentary - December 6, 1996</title>

<body>

<center><h1>Daily Commentary<br>
December 6, 1996</h1></center>

<p><hr width=75% size=3><p>

I'm Gary Bauer for Washington Watch.

<p>

The December chill has set in around the city of Washington.
With Congress out of town and President Clinton embarking on
a second term, the news hereabouts would typically be dominated
by the White House.  But it's been strangely silent at 1600 Pennsylvania
Ave.  Maybe it's the President's bad case of laryngitis although
most people who know Bill Clinton say not even that can keep him
from talking.

<p>

Just think: a month ago, as the Presidential campaign was
in high gear, the White House was reportedly simmering with ideas.
There were new proposals every day to counter education decline
and domestic abuse.  With all of that energy and excitement, staffing
the President's Cabinet should be easy.  But instead the President
only in the last 24 hours has been able to make appointments of
new officials to take us across that bridge to the 21st century.

<p>

Maybe the White House will shake off these December doldrums,
but it may also be that Bill Clinton is undergoing the curse of
the second term.  During this century, second terms have been
notoriously full of failure, indecision and scandal. Will that
be Bill Clinton's fate, too?  Only time will tell.

<p>

<p>

Honor. It's the missing word in modern English.  Honor is
a respect for norms, for history and tradition.  Honor is courage
fused with a deep humility.  Above all, honor is profound honesty.

<p>

But honor today is in trouble.  Just how much trouble is
obvious in a news report about the Congressional Medal of Honor.
It seems that the company that manufactures this prized award
has been doing a little business on the side.  It has been selling
duplicate copies of the medal to whoever is willing to pay.  You
heard me right.  For seventy-five dollars, you're a Congressional
Medal of Honor winner. The Congressional Medal of Honor is rarely
given.  Only the most unusual acts of bravery and self-sacrifice
-- extraordinary valor they call it -- qualify.  The Medal is
sometimes given to a grieving widow, parents pierced to the heart,
a now fatherless child.  None of these things has a commercial
price.

<p>

Once in a while an event comes along that captures vividly
how far we've fallen.  The case of the bogus medals is one of
those events.  America needs to recover its sense of honor.

I'm Gary Bauer for Washington Watch.

<p>

This week, more disturbing news was unveiled about the problem
called Gulf War Syndrome.  If you haven't been following this
story in detail, it involves nearly one hundred thousand American
veterans of the war against Saddam Hussein.  These veterans are
experiencing a wide variety of ailments, including birth defects
among their children, and a dispute is raging over whether exposure
to Iraqi chemical weapons is to blame.  For six years now, our
government has dragged its feet about getting to the bottom of
this.  The latest word is that key documents central to this investigation
are missing.

<p>

I'm neither a military nor medical expert, but foot-dragging
and ineptitude on matters like this are unacceptable.  The Pentagon
should be seeking answers to the nagging questions about Gulf
War Syndrome with the same vigor that it prosecuted the fight
against Iraq.  These young men, and now women, who answered their
country's call were heroes and heroines overseas.  Now our government
is acting like they are only hypochondriacs.  They deserve better
-- much better.

You probably haven't heard of the basketball team from Mount
Zion Christian Academy in Durham, North Carolina, but chances
are you'll soon hear a lot about them.  Many sportswriters and
scouts are calling them possibly the best high school team ever
assembled.

<p>

That in itself is interesting, but this team of athletic
stars is &quot;best&quot; in another and deeper sense, too.  They
are a nucleus of young men brought together as much on the basis
of their dismal past as their bright future.  This Christian school,
led by Pastor Donald Fozard, committed itself long ago to using
basketball to reach boys' souls.  The kids Fozard has taken in
are a motley crew of ex drop-outs, &quot;fall-through-the cracks&quot;
young men.  At Mt. Zion, they experience school as a disciplined
environment.  There are runs at five in the morning, mandatory
church twice-a-week, team prayers.  They are not allowed to date,
swear, listen to rap music, or wear jewelry.

<p>

The focus at Mt. Zion is on character and on the long-term
future -- on right and wrong and on faith.  And that focus is
taking Mt. Zion straight to the top.

<p>

American families want to trust their government in matters
great and small, but sometimes it isn't easy.  As we found with
the recent controversy over air bags, federal officials knew more
about the hazards of these devices than they were willing to tell
us -- supposedly for our own good.  The same goes for Gulf War
syndrome -- the possible exposure of our Desert Storm soldiers
to chemical weapons.

<p>

There was shocking testimony on Capitol Hill this week. 
It now seems clear that military commanders failed to pursue findings
by their own trained personnel that chemical weapon exposure had
taken place.  The British defense ministry has now publicly apologized
for its failure to follow through on the issue too.

<p>

These incidents have a common thread -- a national nanny
government that thinks it must shape and limit what the people
know.  Maybe you've had a similar experience with public officials
-- with the IRS, or with some environmental rule.  Practices like
these create an unhealthy gap between citizen and government.
That just isn't America -- here you have to earn your trust.

He has been christened the &quot;butcher of Tienanmen Square,&quot;
and he visited Washington this week, where he was received with
full military honors.  The communist general I am referring to
is China's Minister of Defense --  the same man, the very same
man, who ordered Red Army Troops to crush the unarmed student
protest that captured the world's attention in 1989.  He was invited
to the United States by President Clinton, who came into office
campaigning for human-rights and who has reduced U.S. policy in
Asia to one vast trade mission.

<p>

While the general was getting the red-carpet treatment, the
European Parliament was giving its major human rights award, the
Sakharov prize, to a jailed Chinese dissident, Wei Jing-Sheng.
Mr. Wei's sister received the award on his behalf.  She used
the occasion to remind us that we have betrayed our principles.
We are supporting &quot;a gang of tyrants&quot; in Beijing, she
declared, because we are focused narrowly on &quot;the great Chinese
market of the future.&quot;

<p>

American policy now betrays American ideals.  This was a
week of shame in Washington.

<p>

Bill Clinton has gone on the warpath again, this time taking
aim at talk radio.  Appearing on a popular talk show, Clinton
denounced talk radio as &quot;overwhelmingly right wing,&quot;
and said it doesn't serve the country well.  Well, I'll concede
one point.  Talk radio can sometimes be crass and crude.  Some
hosts believe you have to offend to get an audience.

<p>

But someone needs to remind the president of something. 
It takes gall to denounce one of the few unstructured forums in
this country for political speech.  Like most politicians, Clinton
ran a tightly controlled, carefully scripted campaign this year.
Talk radio, on the other hand, at least reflects some genuine
give-and-take among average Americans.  Own a phone and you can
be part of the conversation.

<p>

America is a land of freedom, and millions of men and women
have shed blood to keep it that way.  The last thing today's citizens
want or need is a lecture from the just re-elected president of
the United States that their views shouldn't be aired.  After
all, isn't having our say the American way?

Outside the White House press room, there is a gallery of
famous drawings by Norman Rockwell.  Rockwell portrayed reporters
as a classic group of working stiffs, lovable Joe's just waiting
for the right story to come along.  Just how far that image of
the press has faded from the public mind is obvious in a new Harris
Poll.

<p>

By large margins, the poll found, Americans believe reporters
are, get your paper and pencil ready, politically biased, obnoxious,
negative, sensational, and inaccurate.  And if that isn't enough,
the public also believes that reporters have too much influence,
ignore people's privacy, overlook their own errors, show too much
violence, and don't much care about people.  This is hardly good
news for our free press.  The public has about as much faith in
them as it would in Attila the Hun.

<p>

And the Harris Poll also had some hot tips for reporters.
By similar majorities, Americans want the media to root out corruption
in office and to protect the public from abuses of power.  In
short, to be good citizens first.  Now it seems to me that isn't
too much to ask.

<p>

Today is Christmas Eve, and across the country airports and
highways are jammed.  People are heading home for the holidays,
hoping to make it in time for Christmas.  But today there are
tens of thousands of Americans who can only dream of those airports
and highways -- of those homecomings that matter so much.

<p>

Those are the men and women of our Armed Forces.  America
may be at peace, but still there are an incredible 237,000 American
soldiers scattered across the globe.  We're all aware of the contingent
in Bosnia, but the majority of our sons and daughters overseas
are elsewhere.  They are serving with NATO, manning submarines
under polar ice, sweating as military attaches in Africa, or guarding
the truce line in Korea.

<p>

We are not at war, but none of these soldiers serve in safety.
As the publisher of the <I>American Legion Magazine</I> pointed
out recently, the great irony is that the very status of our forces
as emissaries of peace makes them targets of war.  To these men
and women, we say, &quot;Merry Christmas, and may God bless you
and your families.&quot;

<p>

On Christmas Day, we celebrate what might be called the &quot;mundane
miracle.&quot;  It was the most ordinary of events:  the birth
of a baby.  But it was the most impossible of miracles, too: 
the incarnation of God Himself.

<p>

The birth of that baby split human history in two.  Nothing
will ever be the same on this earth.  On an infinitely smaller
scale, the birth of any baby has the same effect on human habits.
Having a child changes us.  Suddenly, the carefree single becomes
caregiving father or mother.  Issues that didn't matter before
suddenly matter a lot --- from personal safety, to what's on TV,
to pornography -- right on down to regular mealtimes.

<p>

Such is the power of a baby.  But today, as more and more
of us turn our back on the child born in Bethlehem, our backs
are turned on other babies, too.  Babies slain in the womb or
left in dumpsters with the other debris of our too-fast times.
How foolish we are to reject new life -- for what is Christmas,
but the eternal promise of new life in Christ?

<p>

The newspapers have been filled lately with all sorts of
stories about questionable political contributions from Asian
sources to President Clinton's reelection and legal defense funds.
The stories raise major issues that go to the integrity of our
political system, and they should be thoroughly investigated.
Unfortunately, there's a danger in all of this that Asian-Americans
as a whole will be falsely stigmatized.

<p>

That makes the story of Kingston Technology even more important.
John Tu and David Sun are business partners who lost $2,000,000
in the 1987 stock market plunge.  Tu is a Chinese immigrant. 
Rather than despair, he and Sun restarted their California-based
business with just $4,000.  Through hard work and ingenuity, they
rebuilt their company and turned it into an American success story.
They just sold the company for $1.5 billion.  And get this, they
are giving their employees an average bonus of $75,000.

<p>

That's some Christmas present -- and it's an even more poignant
reminder that it's not race, but ethics that count.

<p>

Have you heard the news out of Oakland, California?  In that
city, the school board has done something truly idiotic.  They
decided to designate the language of certain minority students
as a foreign language.  The term for this language is &quot;Ebonics,&quot;
but in fact Ebonics is nothing more than English spoken poorly.

<p>

By getting the language patterns of these urban kids established
as a foreign tongue, the school board hoped to take advantage
of bilingual education money.  You heard me right.  Naturally,
the school board's action caused a firestorm.  It's tempting to
joke that all of this is merely a semantic dispute.  These young
kids obviously need help in learning to speak, read, and write
standard English, so who cares where the money comes from?  But
something deeper is at work here.

<p>

This issue really concerns false presumptions about who can
learn.  The Oakland school board is selling its own black students
short.  By doing so, it is limiting their horizons and their job
prospects.  The word for that is &quot;sad&quot; -- in any language.

<p>

I get caught up in holiday shopping as much as anyone, and
I have the bills to prove it.  So naturally my talk today is about
how we make too much of material goods during this spiritual season.
But I have special reason to emphasize that theme.

<p>

Just before Christmas, we received one of those calls in
the night every parent dreads.  The phone rang with the news that
our daughters, Elyse and Sarah, had been in an accident on the
interstate 75 miles from our home.  They were returning from Elyse's
college, and it was a night of sleet and slick roads.  The car
had spun across the highway and been rear-ended. The car was
totaled, but fortunately, both girls' injuries were minor -- a
bad head bump and some whiplash.  But it came home quickly to
us how easily our girls could have been killed on that highway
home.

<p>

The heart of Christmas is the miracle of the child Jesus,
God becoming man.  That miracle was even more meaningful this
year at the Bauer house, all because of what did -- and didn't
-- happen on a dark and icy road.

<p>

During his presidency, Bill Clinton's Secret Service detail
has had a sometimes-stormy relationship with the public.  The
latest incident occurred at the National Cathedral on Christmas
Eve.

<p>

The Rev. Bob Schenck got close enough to Clinton to whisper,
&quot;God will hold you to account, Mr. President.&quot;  According
to Schenck, Clinton heard the remark and understood it as Schenck
meant it -- a reference to the Presidential veto of the partial-birth
abortion ban.  In any event, when the service was over, Secret
Service agents detained Schenck, rifling through his wallet. 
They denied him a lawyer, and told him Clinton had complained
about Schenck's words.

<p>

As I noted, this isn't the first time Secret Service agents
have made life unpleasant for people who dare speak to Clinton.
What Schenck reportedly said is hardly a threat.  In fact, every
one of us will be held accountable by God -- for what we've done,
or failed to do, to show mercy, or kindness, or love.  And on
that day of judgment, none of us will have Secret Service agents
at our side to shield us from the truth.

<p>

House Republicans are deciding whether or not Newt Gingrich will
remain Speaker.  Few think the GOP will fail to keep the leader
who brought them out of forty years in the political wilderness.
Whatever details eventually emerge on this continuing saga, one
thing should be clear:  We have a <I>double</I> standard in Washington
when it comes to ethics.

<p>

The charges against Speaker Gingrich need to be fully explained.
We believe that no official, Speaker or President is above the
law.  But let's be fair.

<p>

Liberals crucified Judge Bork.  They tried to lynch my friend
Clarence Thomas. They nearly ran Ed Meese out of town for ethical
violations so minor that today no one can even remember what they
were.

<p>

Yet serious charges against liberals often go without investigation
and without prosecution.  Why, even now, all the president's men
are in federal court arguing that Paula Jones' credible sexual
harassment charges should not even be heard.

<p>

The motto at the Supreme Court is &quot;equal justice under
law.&quot;  We need to see justice for conservatives as well as 
liberals.  It's only fair.

I'm Gary Bauer for Washington Watch.

<p>

I'm a bit old-fashioned, so every New Year's I make resolutions.
Some are personal -- like remembering to walk the dog before
I turn in for the night.  But others are public.  Here at the
Family Reserch Council, we've made several resolutions for the
New Year.

<p>

First, we're resolved to make 1997 the year of pro-family
tax relief.  Family tax cuts are one of those things that everybody
supports, but nobody enacts.  It's time this nation invested as
much in human capital as it does in physical capital.  Second,
we're resolved to make 1997 a year of national awakening about
the need for judicial reform.  With pending  issues like assisted
suicide and same-sex marriage, there's no time to lose in restoring
legislative power to the American people.  Third, we're resolved
to launch a new youth program, that will help train the next generation
of young men and women in the Judeo-Christian world view.

<p>

Finally, we resolve to seek these goals with an attitude
of prayerful humility.  As we reach out to the better angels of
our neighbors, we must first renew our own better angels.

When a set of indicators is headed in one direction, while
a related indicator is headed the other way, society must take
notice.  That's the case today in the area of drug-related arrests
among juveniles.  Overall, the national crime rate is declining.
But arrests of young people for drug possession are soaring.
Just one example.  In Fairfax County, Virginia, where I live,
the arrest rate for juvenile drug possession has increased <I>sevenfold</I>
since 1991.

<p>

That number is appalling, not just for what it says about
drug use, but also about the conditions in which drug use thrives.
Police now estimate that there are roughly 25,000 gangs operating
in the United States.  All told, these gangs have 652,000 members.
They typically commit all sorts of crimes, but the drug trade
remains a keystone business for most of them.

<p>

Thomas Constantine, head of the federal Drug Enforcement
Administration, calls this situation &quot;a ticking time bomb.&quot;
I agree.  You and I -- and every citizen -- must re-enlist in
the war against drugs.  If we fail, that bomb will go off in a
crowd of our children.

I'm Gary Bauer for Washington Watch.

<p>

Now here's some good news from America's inner city.  Picture
this.  In Baltimore, fifty-eight young boys arrive for school
at 7:15 am.  It's cold and dark outside.  But inside, the boys
get a warm greeting from a Catholic priest and the 31-year old
headmaster at Ignatius Academy.  Each boy shakes hands with the
two men.  It is a civilized ritual.  If their pronunciation is
wrong, it is corrected, but no one is demeaned.  Most of the fifty-eight
boys are black, a few are white or Hispanic.  Only eighteen are
Catholic.  But each boy knows he is a child of God.

<p>

The school operates on the assumption that it makes a 
difference when young children are taught
that Jesus loves them.  It costs five thousand dollars a year
to educate each boy, but that's far less than Baltimore spends
on its public school students.  Generous donors provide scholarships
for the boys and each boy writes a personal thank-you letter,
because they should.  There are no metal detectors here.

<p>

The donors, the parents and the teachers at this school are saving
Baltimore, one soul at a time.  I pray that 1997 will give us
more stories like this academy.

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>

	Tax reform is gaining momentum. Lawmakers from both parties are proposing sweeping changes in the income tax system, such as the Armey-Shelby flat tax (the most widely known of the proposed reforms), a national sales tax, the Nunn-Domenici USA tax, the Gephardt 10 percent tax, and a value-added tax.1 Almost every Republican presidential candidate endorses some form of radical tax reform, and House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA) and Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-KS) asked former Congressman and housing secretary Jack Kemp to chair a commission to recommend how best to reform the tax code. 
<p>
	 Each of the tax reform proposals assumes that the existing income tax system is fundamentally broken and cannot be fixed without a complete overhaul. But they achieve this in significantly different ways. The question is, which approach would be best for taxpayers and the economy?
<p>

<p>

	When evaluated based on nine different criteria, including the degree to which they lower tax rates, simplify the system, address the bias against savings and investment, and treat taxpayers fairly, the plans based on the flat tax model developed by Stanford University Professor Robert Hall and Hoover Institution Senior Fellow Alvin Rabushka score highest.2 Direct consumption taxes also fare well, but proposals that more closely resemble the current system are graded the lowest. <p>	 Since no tax system is perfect, this grading scale is somewhat subjective:  A for reform as close to the ideal as possible,3 B for significant improvement over the current system, C for no significant effect one way or the other, D for a plan (or a feature of a plan) demonstrably worse than today's tax code, and F for significantly worse than today's tax code.<p>	In order to understand these grades, it is necessary to identify what is wrong with the current system and then to determine how each reform plan addresses each of these flaws.<p><b>WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE CURRENT SYSTEM</b><p>	Today's tax code has few defenders. Former Internal Revenue Service Commissioner Shirley Peterson states that there is nothing logical about the way the code is constructed now.4 As House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt points out: <p><blockquote>	 It has become a test of legal brainpower, an accountant's decathlon, a treasure hunt for hidden deductions and buried tax breaks. Our tax code has become a dense fog of incentives, inducements, and penalties that distort the most basic economic decisions, constrain the free market, and make it hard for Americans to run their own lives. The Internal Revenue Service has become a symbol of what is wrong with American government.5</blockquote><P>	And Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole has summed up many of the problems with the current system, noting:<p><blockquote>	During much of the past century, tax policy has been a primary tool with which government has wielded power, fed the bureaucracy, an
d redistributed wealth.... Any fair system would not penalize, but instead reward people for working harder, investing wisely, and saving more. It would eliminate the lobbyist-drafted loopholes that benefit the few, but force the rest of us to pay.6</blockquote><p>	The current income tax system is both anti-growth and discriminatory. Its problems, while seemingly endless, fall into several broad categories:<p><b>High tax rates</b> -- Under present law, a successful entrepreneur will pay more than 40 cents of each additional dollar earned to the federal government. This burden can rise to over 50 cents when state income taxes are included and to more than 80 cents when estate taxes are added. These excessive rates penalize productive economic behavior and reduce incentives to work, create wealth, and take risks.
<p>
<b>Complexity</b> -- The large number of forms, regulations, and rulings forces many Americans to pay professionals to fill out their tax forms. According to the Tax Foundation, annual compliance costs total nearly $200 billion (in addition to the taxes paid to Washington and the loss in economic growth caused by excessive rates).7<p><b>Multiple taxation</b> -- Some forms of income, particularly from savings and investment, are subject to as many as four levels of tax. For example, a dollar of capital income could be subject to corporate income, personal income, capital gains, and estate taxes. This combined burden becomes confiscatory and undermines incentives to save and invest.<p><b>Social engineering</b>  -- Politicians have turned the tax code into a bewildering system of special preferences, penalties, and deductions. Some income is taxed more than once, while other income is not taxed at all. Such complexity is inevitable in a tax system that rewards those with expensive lawyers and accountants and allows lawmakers to micromanage the economy while collecting large campaign contributions from donors seeking to change or preserve sections of the tax code.
<p>


<b>THE COMPETING TAX PLANS</b>
<p>
	While there is widespread agreement on what is wrong with the tax system, there is considerable debate over which plan best solves these problems. The following are the key features of the major tax reform proposals currently under consideration:
<p>
<b>Armey/Shelby flat tax</b> -- Based on the Hall/Rabushka flat tax, H.R. 2060 and S. 1050, sponsored by House Majority Leader Richard K. Armey (R-TX) and Senator Richard Shelby (R-AL), would replace the current personal and corporate income tax system with a simple 17 percent tax on all income. With the exception of a generous family allowance, all labor income is taxed at the individual level. Taxes on business income (such as interest, dividends, capital gains, and rents) are withheld and paid at the business level. Both businesses and individuals would fill out postcard-sized returns. 
<p>
<b>National retail sales tax</b> -- This proposal would replace the personal and corporate income taxes with a sales tax. Many details remain unknown, such as what tax rate would be applied and what goods and services, if any, would be exempted. As of publication, there is no legislation to create a national sales tax, although Representatives Dan Schaefer (R-CO) and Billy Tauzin (R-LA) may introduce a bill shortly. 
<p>
<b>Value-added tax</b> -- This tax, known as the VAT, is similar to a national sales tax, except that it is levied on the additional value created at each stage of production. For example, instead of a 25 percent retail sales tax on purchases at a furniture store, the VAT would tax the logs as they go to the sawmill, the lumber as it goes to the furniture manufacturer, the furniture as it goes to the store, and the same furniture as it is sold to the consumer. The net effect, however, is the same:  a 25 percent tax on the value of the retail sale. There currently is no legislation to replace income taxes with a VAT, although House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer (R-TX) intends to introduce some type of direct consumption tax.
<p>
<b>Nunn/Domenici USA tax</b> -- Sponsored by Senators Sam Nunn (D-GA) and Pete Domenici (R-NM), the Unlimited Savings Account tax (S. 722) creates the equivalent of an unlimited Individual Retirement Account (IRA) and replaces the current rate structure with a three-rate structure that includes a top rate of 40 percent. Some deductions are lost or curtailed, and at least one new deduction is created. The corporate income tax is replaced by a VAT.
<p>
<b>Gephardt 10 percent tax</b> -- This plan, introduced by House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt (D-MO), broadens the tax base by eliminating such preferences as deductions for charitable contributions and state and local taxes and taxing the value of fringe benefits. The proposal also replaces the five current tax brackets with five new brackets ranging between 10 percent and 34 percent.
<p>
<b>Specter flat tax</b> -- Using the same model as the Armey/Shelby flat tax, Senator Arlen Specter (R-PA), in S. 488, proposes a slightly higher rate and lower personal allowance in order to maintain limited deductions for charitable contributions and the full deduction for home mortgage interest.
<p>
	Other tax reform proposals are expected in coming months. Senator Connie Mack (R-FL) may introduce a version of the flat tax which presumably will have many of the same economic benefits as the Armey/Shelby legislation. Senator Bill Bradley (D-NJ) is rumored to be preparing a tax reform bill, though no details are available and his decision to retire may alter those plans. Finally, as the tax reform debate heats up, the Administration might introduce its own plan. The President has said that he finds the flat tax appealing, and Chief of Staff Leon Panetta introduced flat tax legislation as a Member of Congress in 1983. The White House also has expressed interest in the value-added tax,8 although it is unlikely that the Administration would support a VAT as a replacement for the income tax.<p>	<b>GRADING THE TAX PLANS</b><p>	While each reform has an overall grade, it is particularly useful to see how the different proposals address specific flaws in the current system. The grades in the following section indicate the extent to which different tax plans reflect nine important principles of sound tax policy.
<p>
<b>Low Rates</b> 
<p>
	Low tax rates ensure that taxpayers have little incentive to hide, shelter, and underreport income. Because willingness to work, save, invest, and take risks is tied to the expected rewards of such behavior, the lower the tax rate(s), the higher the level of economic growth.
<p>
Armey/Shelby flat tax: <b>A</b>
<p>
	The flat tax popularized by the House Majority Leader begins with a 20 percent rate that phases down to 17 percent in the third year.
<p>
National retail sales tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	Assuming a low rate and with income not taxed directly, the penalty on the creation of wealth would be minor.9<p>Value-added tax:  <b>A</b><p>	As with the national sales tax, a VAT with a low rate would have minimal impact on working, savings, and investment.<p>Nunn/Domenici USA tax:  <b>D</b><P>	The top tax rate in the USA tax is 40 percent, even higher than in current law. To make matters worse, it applies to taxable incomes as low as $24,000 for a family of four.
<p>
Gephardt 10 percent tax:  <b>C</b>
<p>
	Like the current system, the Minority Leader's plan has five separate rates. These rates are slightly lower than in current law, but the expansion of taxable income and the income levels at which the different rates apply offset this minor improvement.
<p>
Specter flat tax: <b>A-</b>
<p>
	The Specter plan's low 20 percent flat rate would stimulate increased work, savings, and investment when compared with current law, although it could be even lower if the remaining deductions were scrapped.
<p>


<b>Simplicity </b>
<p>
	The current income tax has more than 400 different forms, requires more than one billion 1099 forms (tracking interest and dividend income), and necessitates more than five billion hours of effort each year.10 While individuals rightly complain about the costs of simply compiling information, calculating their taxes, and understanding forms, compliance costs for business are twice as high.
<p>
Armey/Shelby flat tax:  <b>A</b>	
<p>
	The current system's plethora of documents, paperwork, and complex record-keeping would be greatly simplified by two postcard-sized forms, one for individuals and one for business.
<p>
National retail sales tax:  <b>B</b>
<p>
	Compliance costs for individuals would disappear, though retail businesses would bear an increased burden because they would be responsible for collecting the tax and complying with reporting requirements.
<p>
Value-added tax:  <b>B+</b>
<p>
	Individual compliance costs would vanish, as would the daunting complexities of the corporate income tax, but businesses would have to maintain detailed records to calculate their share of tax liability as goods and services travel through the production process.
<p>
Nunn/Domenici USA tax: <b> B-</b>
<p>
	Since the burden of the corporate income tax is even worse than a VAT, compliance costs for business would fall under a USA tax. Individual compliance costs could rise relative to the current system, however, because of requirements for tracking deposits and withdrawals into the unlimited IRA.
<p>

Gephardt 10 percent tax: <b>C+</b>
<p>
	The corporate income tax remains the same, but many deductions for the personal income tax are eliminated. This would lead to slightly lower compliance costs for individuals.
<p>
Specter flat tax:  <b>A-</b>
<p>
	With the exception of tracking home mortgage and charitable contributions, the Specter version of the flat tax, like the Armey/Shelby version, also significantly reduces compliance costs.
<p>


<b>Savings and Investment</b> 
<p>
	By double-taxing, triple-taxing, and sometimes even quadruple-taxing income from capital, the current system significantly hinders capital formation. This reduces the quality and quantity of machinery, equipment, and technology in the economy and lowers wages by reducing the amount workers can produce.
<p>

Armey/Shelby flat tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	All income is taxed, but only subject to one level of tax. The current multiple taxation of capital income is eliminated. While this would boost savings and investment compared to current law, the effect would be to make the tax code neutral, neither encouraging nor discouraging savings, investment, or consumption.
<p>
National retail sales tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	By not taxing income directly, the retail sales tax removes the bias in the existing system against savings and investment.
<p>
Value-added tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	Like the sales tax, the VAT addresses the capital formation problem by ending income taxation altogether.
<p>
Nunn/Domenici USA tax: <b>B</b>
<p>
	While the USA tax eliminates the bias against savings and investment caused by multiple taxation by providing an unlimited IRA, it dampens incentives to save and invest by imposing sharply graduated rates.
<p>
Gephardt 10 percent tax:  <b>D-</b>
<p>
	The Minority Leader's plan not only retains the existing anti-savings, anti-investment features of the current system, but also makes the tax code even more hostile to savings and investment by including provisions such as an increase in the tax rate on capital gains.
<p>
Specter flat tax:  <b>A-</b>
<p>
	As with all flat taxes based on the Hall/Rabushka model, there is no bias against capital formation. The continuation of certain deductions, particularly the mortgage interest deduction, does result in a mild distortion of market forces.11<p><b>Social Engineering</b><p>	The tax code today rewards some types of activity, everything from putting a child in daycare to buying a home. Other behaviors, however, such as savings and investment, are penalized harshly. Particularly disturbing is the ability of special interests to add special preferences to the tax code on behalf of wealthy clients.
<P>
Armey/Shelby flat tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	The only preference in the pure flat tax is a family allowance. Government would not attempt to steer economic decisions or try to penalize or reward different types of behavior.
<p>
National retail sales tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	Presuming it would apply equally to all goods and services, the retail sales tax would get government out of the business of micromanaging private decisions. There is a danger, of course, that politicians would impose higher rates on unpopular goods and services (tobacco, caviar, imports) while granting lower or zero rates to others (food, shelter, health care).
<p>
Value-added tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	Like the sales tax, a pure VAT ends government favoritism and efforts to subsidize certain industries or activities. The same caveat -- the potential for discriminatory rates -- applies.
<p>
Nunn/Domenici USA tax:  <b>B</b>
<p>
	Some deductions are eliminated, but this is offset by the creation of new ones such as a deduction for educational expenses. The USA proposal, however, does end the current code's explicit penalties on savings and investment.
<p>
Gephardt 10 percent tax:  <b>B-</b>
<p>
	With the exception of the home mortgage interest deduction, special preferences in the tax code are eliminated. The Minority Leader's plan even taxes fringe benefits. Existing penalties on savings and investment, however, are made even worse by increasing the capital gains tax.
<p>
Specter flat tax: <b>A-</b>
<p>
	Except for continuing limited individual deductions for mortgage interest and charitable contributions, the Specter version of the flat tax takes government officials out of the business of picking winners and losers.
<p>


<b>Intrusiveness/Civil Liberties </b>
<P>
	In part because of the code's numbing complexity, but also because of legislative directives, the IRS engages in tax collection activities that many believe are abusive. A simple tax code, with easily understood rules that apply to everyone, would solve much of this problem. Because all tax systems ultimately are based on coercion, and thus are accompanied by police powers for the taxing authority, the highest grades are given to proposals that minimize the scope and opportunity for intrusion.
<P>

Armey/Shelby flat tax: <b> A</b>
<p>
	By dramatically reducing the complexities of the current system, this plan would leave taxpayers with less reason to fear the IRS. For individual taxpayers, the only possible areas of controversy are the size of one's family and the amount of labor income earned (taxes on capital income are withheld and paid at the business level). Whatever problems remain -- including how the self-employed handle deductions, particularly if they work out of their homes -- would be a fraction of those that exist now.
<p>
National retail sales tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	Small businesses will not appreciate collecting taxes for the federal government, but the level of intrusion resulting from a properly designed sales tax is small compared with the current system. This is particularly true in states that already impose sales taxes.
<p>
Value-added tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	In its pure form, the VAT should minimize most tax collection abuses. Businesses would need to maintain records, but the impositions on privacy would be small compared with the current system.12<p>Nunn/Domenici USA tax:  <b>C</b>	<p>	Much of the current tax system is left in place. Moreover, the government will require detailed financial records from individuals who lower their tax burden by saving.<p>Gephardt 10 percent tax:  <b>C</b><p>	Some deductions disappear, presumably reducing the potential for disputes with the IRS, but the multiple taxation of savings and investment becomes more pervasive, a step that will create more conflicts between citizens and tax authorities. The net effect is probably zero.
<P>
Specter flat tax:  <b>A-</b>
<p>
	Simple and straightforward, the Specter flat tax should eliminate most abuses. Retention of certain limited deductions, however, requires record-keeping and creates opportunities for IRS intrusion into taxpayers' personal affairs.
<p>


<b>Fairness</b>
<P>
	Fairness in the tax system should mean equal treatment. Any special treatment, either preference or penalty, violates this principle. All taxpayers -- and all income -- should be treated equally.
<P>
	
Armey/Shelby flat tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	All taxpayers pay the same rate, and all income is taxed once. The only exemption is the zero bracket amount (personal allowance) based on family size.
<p>
National retail sales tax:  <b>A</b>
<P>
	All taxpayers presumably will pay the same rate, and all goods and services presumably will be taxed. As with the flat tax, there probably will be some mechanism to eliminate any tax liability for those with low incomes.
<p>
Value-added tax:  <b>A</b>
<P>
	Like the retail sales tax, the VAT theoretically should apply equally to all taxpayers and not discriminate by charging different rates. Also, there likely will be a process by which to offset the tax burden for the poor.
<p>
Nunn/Domenici USA tax:  <b>C-</b>
<p>
	Maintaining steeply graduated rates means that the law will not apply equally to all taxpayers. Government would continue to interfere with economic decisions by granting preferential treatment to certain activities. Also, the estate tax would remain, applying double taxation to the affected income.
<p>
Gephardt 10 percent tax:  <b>D-</b>
<P>
	Like the USA tax, the Gephardt proposal includes steeply progressive rates that explicitly impose special penalties on certain citizens. Compounding this error is its exacerbation of the current code's multiple taxation of capital income. The only provision that precludes a failing grade is the elimination of some deductions.
<p>
Specter flat tax:  <b>A-</b>
<P>
	This proposal has all the fairness of the Armey plan, with the exception of modest deductions for mortgage interest and charitable contributions.
<P>

<b>Downside Risk</b>
<p>
	While many tax reform proposals are conceptually attractive and would boost the economy if enacted, they should not be examined in a vacuum. The long-term ability of each tax to retain these theoretical benefits must be considered.
<p>
Armey/Shelby flat tax:  <b>B</b>
<P>
	Just as lawmakers began raising rates after the 1986 tax reform act, future Congresses could undo a flat tax. One advantage of a pure flat tax, however, is that any changes would be obvious to voters. 
<p>
 The worst that could happen is that policy might drift back to where it is now, but a constitutional amendment requiring a supermajority to raise tax rates would address this concern.
<p>
National retail sales tax:  <b>F</b>
<p>
	The great risk with a retail sales tax is that politicians might adopt a direct consumption tax, but never get around to abolishing the income tax. Also, if state experience is any indication, a sales tax might be manipulated so that some products are exempted while others are subjected to punitive rates. A constitutional amendment explicitly barring an income tax would solve this problem.
<p>
Value-added tax:  <b>F</b>
<p>
	All the risks inherent in a retail sales tax exist with a VAT. The European experience shows that it gives politicians an incentive to have both a direct consumption tax and an income tax.13 Moreover, the VAT is applied at arbitrary and uneven rates in most countries. As with the sales tax, a constitutional change could resolve this concern.
<p>
Nunn/Domenici USA tax:  <b>F</b>
<p>
	The USA proposal replaces the corporate income tax with a VAT. Therefore, concerns that the government might have two major revenue sources are not just theory, but reality. The risk also exists that the corporate income tax either would never be abolished or would be recreated.
<p>
Gephardt 10 percent tax:  <b>C</b>
<p>
	In a sense, there is not much downside risk with the Gephardt plan because the proposal is not an improvement over current law. On the plus side, the plan creates no new taxes and would require a referendum to increase taxes in the future.
<p>
Specter flat tax:  <b> B-</b>
<p>
	Like the Armey/Shelby proposal, the Specter flat tax is haunted by the evidence since the 1986 tax reform act. Because the Specter version explicitly accepts the notion that policymakers should impose tax preferences because it preserves certain deductions, the risks are somewhat higher that the tax code could be skewed even further.
<p>

<b>Evasion </b>
<p>
	Support for any tax system and its long-term viability depends on how the law works. If there are opportunities for individuals to evade taxes -- and if enough of them take advantage of those opportunities -- the public will view the law as corrupt. Moreover, the loss of revenue will encourage politicians to raise rates on those who do comply with the law, thereby encouraging still more evasion. The downward spiral of higher rates followed by more evasion could be endless.
<p>
Armey/Shelby flat tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	Because of its low rate, this tax provides minimal incentives for evasion. Moreover, by taxing business income at the source, it eliminates the need for more than one billion 1099 forms and simplifies enforcement considerably.
<p>
National retail sales tax:  <b>D</b>
<p>
	The evidence suggests that retail sales taxes higher than about 10 percent are subject to widespread evasion.14 Indeed, almost every country with a VAT originally had a sales tax but changed once rates crept above that level because of problems with complexity and compliance.15<p>Value-added tax:  <b>B+</b>	<p>	A VAT does allow the government to enforce much greater compliance than is possible under a sales tax because the tax is collected at each stage of the production process and there is no need to track whether a product is being sold at retail or wholesale.<p>Nunn/Domenici USA tax:  <b>B</b><p>	The high tax rates in the USA tax will increase incentives to use the underground economy. Moreover, because there will be no tax on income put into savings (and no taxes levied on funds withdrawn from savings), there could be incentives to find ways to manipulate this system.
<p>
Gephardt 10 percent tax:  <b>C</b>
<p>
	Evasion is not likely to change significantly under the Minority Leader's plan. Eliminating certain deductions could reduce evasion opportunities, but increasing the multiple taxation of capital income will increase incentives to hide or underreport income.
<p>

Specter flat tax:  <b>A-</b>
<p>
	Retaining limited deductions and taxing at a slightly higher rate could cause a modest reduction in compliance compared to a pure flat tax since there would be an opportunity to exaggerate deductions.
<p>


<b>International Competitiveness</b> 
<p>
	In a world where capital funds react quickly to changes in a nation's business climate, a tax system that rewards entrepreneurship will attract increased investment and job creation. A system that penalizes growth with high tax rates and imposes multiple levels of taxation on capital income, by contrast, will suffer from capital flight. In addition to their effects on growth, international provisions in the current code are a major source of complexity. Unfortunately, as Chart 4 illustrates, America has undermined its ability to compete by raising tax rates while most of our competitors have been cutting tax rates.
<p>
Armey/Shelby flat tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	By eliminating the multiple taxation of capital income, all flat taxes based on the Hall/Rabushka model will trigger a surge of new investment and jobs in the United States. By ending the complex practice of taxing American companies and individuals on their foreign income (already taxed in the country where it is earned), the flat tax model will lower compliance costs dramatically and encourage more U.S. firms to enter the global market.
<p>
National retail sales tax:   <b>A</b>
<p>
	Replacing the current, deeply flawed income tax with a direct consumption tax will boost international competitiveness, increase investment, and stimulate job creation. However, the benefits result from ending the income tax, not from imposing the sales tax. Some proponents argue that a sales tax would help the economy and the balance of trade, because it would be levied on goods and services coming into the country while exports would be exempt. This would not create a competitive advantage for America.16 Products sold in America, whether foreign-made or domestic, would be subject to the U.S. sales tax. Likewise, products sold in other countries, whether domestic or American-made, would be subject to applicable sales taxes or VATs in those countries.
<P>
Value-added tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	As with the retail sales tax, a VAT will attract foreign investment and encourage job creation. As noted above, these benefits do not flow automatically from a direct consumption tax. VATs and other sales-based taxes simply create level playing fields. Their benefits stem from elimination of the income tax.
<P>
Nunn/Domenici USA tax:  <b>B</b>
<p>
	Like the Armey/Shelby flat tax, the USA tax largely ends the complex practice of taxing businesses on income earned overseas. It also eliminates most multiple taxes on capital income, a reform that would encourage foreign investment. Unfortunately, some of these incentives would be offset by high marginal tax rates.
<p>
Gephardt 10 percent tax:  <b>C</b>
<p>
	Because the current tax system penalizes growth with high tax rates and imposes multiple levels of taxation on capital income, it is extremely destructive to international competitiveness. The Minority Leader's proposal might exacerbate this problem somewhat by expanding the multiple taxation of capital income.17<p>Specter flat tax:  <b>A-</b><p>	With a low rate and no tax burden on foreign income because it already is taxed by the nation where it is earned, the Specter flat tax would boost growth and attract capital from overseas.<p><b>CONCLUSION</b><p>	The current income tax system demands comprehensive reform. High rates punish success, excessive complexity drains productive resources, and punitive taxation of capital income retards savings and investment. Of the many proposals have been offered to correct these flaws, reforms based on the Hall/Rabushka flat tax are the best. The flat tax replaces the current five-tiered punitive rate structure with a simple, fair 17 percent rate. The current system's plethora of documents, paperwork, and complex record-keeping is replaced by two postcard-sized forms, one for individuals and one for business. 
<p>
	 Direct consumption taxes like the retail sales tax and VAT theoretically achieve similar results, though such proposals also risk creating major new sources of tax revenue for the federal government. If these proposals were made contingent on enacting a constitutional amendment barring income taxes, this concern would disappear. Finally, plans that attempt to preserve features of the current system, such as the USA tax and the Gephardt 10 percent tax, fall short of the goal. By maintaining a discriminatory system of graduated rates, these plans fail the critical tests of growth, simplicity, and fairness.

<blockquote>



"Barbara Coe, a leading proponent of immigration reform in California, was threatened with legal action by the Justice Department, the Orange County Registrar's Office, and immigrant advocacy groups for 'intimidating voters' on Election Day.
<P> 
	"Her crime? Distributing fliers that proclaimed: 'Only citizens can vote! Violators will be prosecuted!'
<P>
	"Latino groups saw her campaign as a blatant, racist effort to intimidate legitimate voters, many of whom were new citizens casting their first votes. But Mrs. Coe, 62, a Huntington Beach grandmother, said she felt the fliers were necessary to combat voter fraud after hearing from Hispanic members of the California Coalition for Immigration Reform, which she founded and chairs. . . .
<P>
	"In her view, the problem is twofold. Many immigrants are unaware that noncitizens cannot vote. Others, however, 'know it's against the law, but they don't care. They know there's no prosecution. There are no safeguards,' she said. 
<P>
	"She already has obtained a list of 18 illegal immigrants who voted, compiled by a social worker on duty at a local polling place, she said. . . .
<P>
	"An official from the Justice Department's civil-rights division called and interviewed her for more than an hour about complaints they'd received about her fliers. . . .
<P>
	"Then the Orange County registrar of voters called. 'She was just ballistic,' Mrs. Coe recalled. 'She said, If I get one complaint of voter intimidation, I'm going to prosecute you to the full extent of the law.'
<p>
	"Likewise, California Secretary of State Bill Jones put her on notice that he would not tolerate any intimidation activities. 'Interfering with any individual's right to vote . . . is a crime,' he wrote." . . .

<blockquote>



"We've seen Gary Aldrich's name on the best-seller list for several months now. Obviously he's raking in the dough with his book <I>Unlimited Access: An FBI Agent Inside the Clinton White House</I>. Think again. In fact, if the White House has its way, Mr. Aldrich may never see a dime in book royalties. 'I put all I own on the line to expose the criminal behavior and discredited security procedures in the Clinton White House,' Mr. Aldrich writes in a public appeal for donations. 'Now, my wife, Nina, and I and our three young children could lose everything. That's right, everything.' Attorney General Janet Reno, the former FBI agent writes, is deciding whether to prosecute him and confiscate the proceeds of his book, as the FBI recommends. . . .'Even now, the Clinton Administration lawyers are threatening to tie up all my assets and keep me in court for six years or more,' Mr. Aldrich writes in his letter. He says he's already spent nearly $100,000 in legal fees, exhausting his life savings fighting lawyers from the FBI, Justice Department, and White House."

To date, more than 30 children have been killed by air-bag deployment, many of them in low-speed accidents, and there is mounting evidence that these devices may endanger certain adults as well. The children's deaths are not merely a tragic side effect; air bags kill more kids under age 10 than they save."

	"Not surprisingly, some of the course descriptions that standout, even in this amazing list, come from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, locally called Zoo Mass, where the education department offers three different courses on 'Special Issues in Education,' including two fairly recent concerns of the left, 'HandicapismDynamics of Handicapism on Personal and Institutional Levels,' 'HeterosexismDynamics of Heterosexism on Personal and Institutional Levels,' and third, that timeworn leftist obsession, 'ClassismDynamics of Classism on Personal and Institutional Levels.'
<P>
	"But from the University of California at Santa Cruz comes the scariest offering. A Big Brotheror should we say, Big Sister-minded education department presents students with Education 189: 'Monitoring Girls for Science and Math Equity: This six-credit, multiple-term course provides opportunities for women students from any discipline to mentor girls in local K12 classrooms. Mentors are trained to promote equity in science, math, and technology.' Gifted boys had better learn to keep quiet or face fierce reprimand."

	"Florida prison doors will swing wide open for 445 murderers, sex offenders, kidnappers, and child abusers beginning today after a state Supreme Court restored time off for good behavior for the state's most violent offenders, prison officials said. Attorney General Bob Butterworth said he'll appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, but by then hundreds of inmates will have been released. Officials are trying to determine who will be freed immediately. The pending releases have generated protests from the public. 'We've done everything we can to keep them locked up,' Corrections Department spokeswoman Debbie Buchanan said.

	"The town of Colma, Calif., is giving new definition to the old adage that nothing is certain in this world except death and taxes. Town officialsColma is located just south of San Franciscowant to tax every grave that's within city limits at a rate of $5 per year, forever.
<P>
	"The tax would provide a windfall for the city, not only financing Colma's police and fire departments but many other city services as well. . . .
<P>
	"The Colma cemeteries would pay the tax, according to a story in Long Island <I>Newsday</I>, but costs would, of course, be passed on to future customers. Estimates are that the price of burial plots would more than double, to $6,000."

<blockquote>






	"A furor erupted in Virginia this summer when an investigator, hired by Governor George Allen to probe state agencies distributing $17 million in federal funds for day-care and early-childhood programs, discovered financial mismanagement including the 'steering' of funds  to organizations with a leftist ideology. Some of the groups that received money promoted a college curriculum for 'politically  correct' day-care professionals. One such group, the National Association for the Education of Young Children, published an 'anti-bias curriculum' that argues that homophobia 'must be addressed in the day-care setting.' Not only this, but the 'anti-bias educator of young children must be prepared to address both the gender and sexual differentiations of the sexes for two-year olds' and to identify 'oppressive situations which might be addressed by boycotts or demonstrations during day-care sessions.'

<P>
	"Cissy Lacks, a 25-year teaching veteran, called Monday's decision against the Ferguson-Florissant School District 'a really important statement.' The district plans to appeal. 
<P>
	"Lacks was fired from her job at Berkeley High School after the school board found out she had allowed 11th-graders to use street language in a creative writing assignment. A federal judge reinstated her in August.
<P> 
	"Some of the student skits were videotaped in October 1994 and shown to school officials. District lawyers said students uttered a profanity every 12 seconds on average.
<P> 
	"Jurors awarded Lacks $500,000 for the claim that she didn't get reasonable notice of her dismissal and that a ban on classroom profanity served no legitimate academic purpose. 
<P>
	"They awarded her $250,000 on a race discrimination claim. Lacks, who is white, said black school officials objected to black students using profanity on videotape. She contended race was a motivation in the way she was treated."

<h2>External Relations Department</h2>
<hr>
<p>
Founded in January 1995, the External Relations department handles Heritage's outreach to the business community, to other policy organizations, and to the nation's governors and state officials. 
<p>
External Relations is headed by Heritage Vice President <a href="/heritage/staff/gaynerl.htm">Lew Gayner</a>, who directs department activities with the assistance of his managers: Bridgett Wagner, director of <a href="/heritage/dept_writeups/business.html">Business Relations</a>; <a href="/heritage/staff/atwood.htm">Tom Atwood</a>, director of Coalition Relations; and the Project on Federalism and the States director, <a href="/heritage/staff/seay.htm">Doug Seay</a>.
<p>
To reach their target audiences, Gayner and his staff  sponsor Washington Policy Roundtables, bi-monthly forums for Washington-based corporate representatives; the Physicians Council, a coalition of doctors who advocate health care reform based on consumer choice and competition; the <a href="/heritage/dept_writeups/rban.htm">Resource Bank</a>, Heritage's networking arm to other public policy groups in the U. S. and abroad; and <a href="/heritage/dept_writeups/gov_for.htm">The Project on Federalism and the States</a> which works to directly involve governors and state and local government officials in national policy decisions.
<p>
Gayner also directs Heritage's Corporate Associates, a program of conferences, briefings, and special publications for the Foundation's major corporate donors; co-sponsors the American Trader Initiative Advisory Council, a coalition of business and public policy leaders who advise Heritage on trade issues; and hosts bi-annual National Security Symposiums for the defense industry.  In addition, External Relations hosts monthly working group meetings with congressional staff and provides private briefings for business executives at Heritage and at corporate headquarters.

<TITLE> A Tyranny of the Judiciary?
 -- November 1996 Insider - Heritage</TITLE>
<center><img src="/heritage/thf_log2.gif"><br><p>
<h3>November, 1996 <i>Insider</i></h3></center> 



<CENTER><h3> A Tyranny of the Judiciary?
</h3></CENTER><HR>
<P>
<dd>	Consider the many conservative policy proposals which have been enacted recently, or are on your "wish list." Think about the tremendous popular support many of these plans enjoy. . . .Then realize that the courts have overturned some of these programs already and may well derail numerous others. 
<P>
<dd>
	The combination of litigious, liberal advocacy groups and a judiciary too often willing to make law, rather than interpret the Constitution threatens to negate many of the gains conservatives have made in the war of ideas and at the ballot box. As soon as a program such as school choice or the California Civil Rights Initiative passes, a lawsuit is immediately filed to prevent its implementation. 
<P>
<dd>
	What we seem to get in many cases is a tyranny of judges -- <I>de facto</I> rule by jurists whose power is unchecked and who see fit to mold society to suit their own personal concepts of justice. Most often, this judicial activism reinforces the reigning liberal orthodoxy which has taken hold of American legal institutions.
<P>
<dd>
	As conservatives prepare to wage many crucial battles in the courts, the Federalist Society has built a network designed to overcome legal abuses and to return America to a legal system which operates according to the design of the founders.
<P>
<dd>
	The Federalist Society advances traditional legal principles such as limited, constitutional government; individual freedom and responsibility; traditional values; and the rule of law. Our 22,000 lawyers, law students, academics, public officials, and other concerned citizens actively forward these ideals locally and nationally.

<P>
<dd>	The Society's 145 Student Division chapters at law schools across the country and 60 Lawyers Division chapters in major legal centers provide us with a grass-roots community presence nationwide.
	<P>
<dd>The combination of our strong local base and our national stature allows the Federalist Society to promote the serious inquiry which generates solutions to vital legal and policy questions. Our members are increasingly involved in every stage of the public policy process from recognizing political opportunities to building intellectual and academic support to winning legislative debates. 
<P>
<dd>	We aim to involve in the public policy discussion Citizen-Lawyers who will fight the legal and policy battles crucial to our principles. Today, there is much of this work to be done.
<P>
<dd>
	The following list of activities highlights some of the ways in which the Federalist Society is forwarding its goals:
<P>
<dd>
	Our <b>E.L. Wiegand Practice Groups</b> create a national network of active attorneys dedicated to traditional legal principles. The 15 topics covered by the Practice Groups include: Civil Rights, Constitutional Law, Corporate Law, Criminal Law, Environmental Law, Free Speech, Intellectual Property, Litigation, and Religious Liberties. By mobilizing our members in this manner, we will have a large impact on the development of law in each of these areas.
<P>
<dd>
	The Society's <b><i>Pro Bono</i> Resource Network</b> links Federalist Society lawyers with like-minded groups and individuals needing legal assistance. Through this outreach, our members use their professional talents on behalf of the principles in which they believe.
<P>
<dd>
	The <b>ABA Watch Project</b> centers around a semi-annual <i>ABA Watch</i> newsletter, the first of which was released in August at the American Bar Association convention. This periodical publicizes the activities of the ABA. In so doing, we expect to generate a great deal of discussion about the organized bar and the fears of many that it has become a left-wing advocacy group.
<P>
<dd>
	Of course, the Society's core programs -- local chapter meetings, national and regional conferences, and publications -- will continue to promote traditional legal principles. 
	<P>
<dd>
In sum, the Federalist Society educates the legal community and the general public about the proper role of the legal system, activates legal professionals on behalf of conservative causes, and provides assistance to friendly local, state-wide, and national groups.
	<P>

<B>U.S. and Asia Statistical Handbook 1996</B>,<br>
 compiled and edited by John Dori and Richard Fisher
<br>
The Heritage Foundation Asian Studies Center<hr>
<P>
John Dori, Research Associate of the Asian Studies Center at The Heritage Foundation, and Richard Fisher, Senior Policy Analyst of the Asian Studies Center at The Heritage Foundation, have compiled the 11th annual U.S. and Asia Statistical Handbook. The authors note that U.S.-Asia trade grew dramatically in 1995. The rise in exports to Asia outpaced the growth of exports to all other regions of the world. To help policy makers and the public understand the key issues facing the world's most dynamic region, the Asian Studies Center has compiled key social, political, economic, and military statistics on the United States and 33 countries in East of South Asia. this year's edition includes a chart summarizing the findings of Heritage's Index of Economic Freedom. 91 pp.  CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto:Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org,</a>, Internet <a href="http://www.heritage.org">http://www.heritage.org</a>.

 by John Hillen<br>
<I>Backgrounder</I> No. 1096, The Heritage Foundation<hr>
<p>
John Hillen, Policy Analyst at The Heritage Foundation, argues that the United States must enact a staged removal of U.S. and NATO military forces from Bosnia in order to avoid a likely decades-long military commitment to the region. Specifically, according to Hillen, the U.S. should keep only a limited number of support troops in Bosnia in 1997, and there should be no U.S. ground troops in a new follow-on implementation force. The follow-on implementation force should be European-led, and eventually lead to European responsibility for the regional peacekeeping burden. All U.S. troops should be removed by 1998, for, according to Hillen, America's main purpose in NATO is not to police ethnic conflicts in Europe. The peacekeeping responsibility should come under such European organizations as the Western European Union or the Organization for the Security and Cooperation in Europe after NATO's departure.  11 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto:Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org,</a>, Internet <a href="http://www.heritage.org">http://www.heritage.org</a>.

Robert O'Quinn, Policy Analyst at the Asian Studies Center of The Heritage Foundation, argues that the United States should build a better partnership with Australia to protect its economic and security interests in the Asia-Pacific region. Australia has recently become a major player in the region. This has been due to Australia's efforts over the past ten years to deregulate its economy and dismantle its extremely protectionist trade policies that nearly brought the country to economic ruin by the 1980s. Australia has embraced the dynamic Asian market and reoriented its diplomatic and economic ties toward Asia and the United States. O'Quinn notes that the U.S. cannot duplicate the diplomatic, economic, and military ties that proximity and diplomacy have presented to Australia. To secure vital American interests in the Asia-Pacific region, according to O'Quinn, Washington should cooperate with Canberra on trade and security issues. Specifically, the President should: ask Congress to end the dairy, agriculture export subsidy, and sugar programs that have prevented further trade liberalization in Australia; ask congress to allow intracoastal-coastal shipping to use foreign-built, foreign-operated, or foreign-owned vessels to reduce logistics costs for American firms; ask Congress for fast-track authority to negotiate trade agreements free of contentious environmental and labor standards issues; ask congress to take further steps all around to liberalize trade, especially in areas of conflict between the U.S. and Australia; and strengthen U.S. military ties to Australia by offering to sell Canberra <I>Tomahawk</I> long-range cruise missiles and by including Australia in the development of a future Asian missile defense network. 15 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto:Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org,</a>, Internet <a href="http://www.heritage.org">http://www.heritage.or

<B>Trashing Free Trade: The Basel Convention's Impact on International Commerce</B>, <br>
by James Sheehan<br>
Competitive Enterprise Institute<hr><P>
James Sheehan, Research Associate at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, discusses international hazard waste regulations and their impact on international commerce. The Basel Convention was signed in 1989 to create a global regulatory regime to control trade in hazardous wastes. It has three primary objectives: 1) reduce transboundary movements of hazardous wastes to a minimum; 2) ensure that hazardous wastes be treated and disposed of as close as possible to their source of generation; and 3) minimize hazardous waste generation at source. Sheehan argues that global hazardous waste regulation does nothing to change the root causes of environmental degradation. He notes that illegal dumping of waste is most often a problem in countries where there is little private property, and unresponsive or corrupt government bureaucracies. International trade  does not directly cause environmental degradation, and international trade controls cut off developing countries from important materials and supplies that only international markets can supply. Many developing countries see environmental demands by industrialized nations as new forms of protectionism designed to close markets. Sheehan argues that the U.S. should refrain from further active participation in the Basel Convention. According to Sheehan, the U.S. should reject even the possibility of global trade regulation and an export ban. Free trade and government controls are incompatible concepts. He concludes that developing countries must stand firm against the green trade restrictions of the Basel Convention. 22 pp.  CONTACT: Competitive Enterprise Institute, 1001 Connecticut Avenue, N.W., Suite 1250, Washington, D.C. 20036, 202/331-1010, fax 202/331-0640.

<B>ESTIMATING OSHA COMPLIANCE COSTS</B>,<BR> 
BY HARVEY JAMES<BR>
<I>Policy Study</I> No. 135, Center for the Study of American Business<hr>
<p>
According to a study by economist Harvey James, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) imposes greater regulatory compliance costs to the economy than previously estimated. Based on regulatory impact analyses (RIAs) commissioned by OSHA of 25 major rules issued by the agency after 1980, he estimates that manufacturers in 1993 paid an additional 46,300 each year on average per firm for the 25 OSHA regulations established since 1980. James's analysis has revealed some interesting facts, including: Construction firm spending exceeds $700,000 annually per firm to comply with just one hazardous waste operations regulation; OSHA rules on air quality and process safety are the most costly in the manufacturing sector with costs exceeding $9,000 and $36,000 a year per firm, respectively; the cost of compliance with OSHA's lead standard is nearly $400,000 a year for affected manufacturers; and OSHA's study of the economic impact of proposed Comprehensive Occupational Safety and Health Reform Act (COSHRA) projects total compliance costs at over $10 billion a year. James argues that in order to expose the full impact of OSHA regulations, a reliable survey of compliance expenditures needs to be established. He proposes a survey similar to the Pollution Abatement and Control Expenditures (PACE) reports made annually by the Census Bureau for the EPA. James concludes that there is reasonable basis for establishing a regulatory budget for OSHA. 29 pp. CONTACT: Center for the Study of American Business, Washington University, Campus Box 1208, St. Louis, MO 63130-4899, 314/935-5630, fax 314/935-5688.

<b>The Last Monopoly: Privatizing the Postal Service for the Information Age</b>, <br>
Edited by Edward Hudgins<br>
Cato Institute<hr>
<p>
The Cato Institute presents a collection of essays on returning mail delivery to the free market. The first chapter is by U.S. Postmaster General Marvin Runyon. He tries to make a case that there is a national consensus to keep government in the business of delivering the mail, but that the right amount of deregulation will allow the U.S. Postal Service to compete on equal footing with other couriers. He maintains that universal mail service "backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government," is necessary to bind the nation together. James Cambell looks at the creeping expansion of the postal monopoly. Peter Ferrara argues that their are inherent problems with a postal monopoly that have meant rates as much as 50 percent higher than they would be if competition were allowed. Stephen Gibson, Executive Director of the Bionomics Institute illustrates how the Information Age is bypassing the "Machine Age Postal Service." Economist  Thomas DiLorenzo and Richard Geddes contribute essays on "Natural Monopoly Myths" and "Patterns of Private Delivery," which undermine the case for privatizing the assets of the USPS and thereby moving postal services entirely into the free market. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher proposes converting the USPS into an employee stock-ownership company. And Douglas Adie, author of Monopoly Mail, proposes breaking up the U.S. Postal Service, into regional divisions that would then be sold off. 138 pp.  CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC 20001, 202/842-0200, fax 202/842-3490, E-mail <a href=:mailto: cato@cato.org ">cato@cato.org</a>, Internet <a href=" http://www.cato.org">http://www.cato.org</a>.

<b>What to Do About Universal Service Subsidies: Support for High-Cost Areas</b>,<br>
 by Wayne Leighton<br>
<I>Issue Analysis</I> No. 39, Citizens for a Sound Economy<hr>
<P>
Wayne Leighton, Senior Economist for Citizens for a Sound Economy, discusses the issue of Universal Service Subsidies for high-cost telephone service areas. The 1996 Telecommunications Act continues, and potentially expands, current universal service subsidies to high-cost telephone servicing areas. The Federal State Joint Board and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) have been granted considerable authority under the Act to significantly expand the current arrangement of subsidies. Leighton argues that a more limited approach could be taken by relegating more authority over universal service issues to state-level regulators and that subsidies should be brought to a minimum. The size of universal service subsidies, according to Leighton, should be based on the most accurate cost estimates. Methods for cost estimates based upon historical costs tend to inflate the amount of actual expenses incurred, while hypothetical estimates rely on a regulator's calculations. He concludes that for high-cost markets, competitive bidding may offer the most effective way to determine the minimum amount needed to provide a universal service subsidy. This would still guarantee the same quality of service to high-costs areas, while at the same time bringing competition to the market. This competition will drive costs down and efficiency up. 18 pp. CONTACT: Citizens for a Sound Economy, 1250 H Street, N.W., Suite 700, Washington, DC 20005-3908, 202/783-3870, fax 202/783-4687, Internet <a href="http://www.cse.org/cse">http://www.cse.org/cse</a>.

<p>
Ron Utt, Senior Fellow at The Heritage Foundation, and Dan Hickey, Special Assistant to The Heritage Foundation's Vice President for Domestic Policy Issues, have compiled a third report on instances of waste and excess in government spending. Utt and Hickey list the names and phone numbers of the people in charge of each government agency where the financial abuses took place. Cases of waste and excess includes: 1) The expenses from the widespread misuse of Vice President Al Gore's recommendation that government agencies make greater use of credit cards; 2) 93 percent failure of the Housing Authority of New Orleans (HANO) units in maintenance inspections, while 16 new Ford LTD Crown Victoria passenger vehicles were purchased for the central office staff despite the availability of only one pickup truck for HANO maintenance crews; 3) Massive subsidies for such absentee ranchers and farmers as Louis Farrakhan's Nation of Islam, and celebrity news reporter Sam Donaldson; 4) Amtrack's proposed use of $40 million in taxpayer money to set up costly new service between Boston and Portland, Maine, that will take longer than existing inexpensive private bus service; 5) Information from internal Agency for International Development (AID) reports that shows that up to one-third of the total funds spent on some projects are lost through gross misuse such as contributing to parties, gifts, obituaries in newspapers, flowers, tips, radios, conference prizes, and new clothes for Bank employees to wear to a population development conference; and finally, 6) Cases of food stamp abuse such as that by a Tennessee woman with assets valued at over $350,000 receiving $27,000 in food stamps and welfare benefits over a three-and-a-half-year period, and another instance where food stamps were used to by caviar. Finding room for tax relief can begin with eradicating such flagrant waste as the examples listed in this paper. 4 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-49

Michael Schuyler, IRET Senior Economist, and Norman Ture, President of IRET, examine key deficiencies in federal procedures for estimating how tax changes affect government revenue. According to the authors, failings in current procedures, notably the insistence that tax changes do not affect the overall economy, systematically mislead policy makers, resulting in tax policies that may cost the American public hundreds of billions of dollars yearly.

<b>The Case for an Across-the-Board Tax Rate Reduction</b>, <br>
by Bruce Bartlett<br>
<I>Policy Backgrounder</I> No. 140, National Center for Policy Analysis<hr>
<p>
Bruce Bartlett, Senior Fellow at the National Center for Policy Analysis, puts forth the case for reducing tax rates across the board. He points out that total taxes as a share of the GDP were the highest in U.S. history in 1995 -- 31.3 percent. American paid $151.1 billion more in federal taxes than if federal receipts had remained at their 1992 level of 19.2 percent of GDP. Reducing individual income tax rates across the board by 15 percent would lower federal receipts as a share of GDP to what they were in 1992. The across-the-board tax cut would not solve the tax problem. A tax reduction must be accompanied by spending reduction. As long as federal spending consumes over 20 percent of our national output, it will be impossible to lower taxes as much as is needed. 13 pp. CONTACT: National Center for Policy Analysis, 12655 N.

<b>The Moral Case for the Flat Tax</b>,<br>
 by Steve Forbes<br>
<I>Imprimis</I> Vol. 25, No. 10, Hillsdale College<hr>
<P>
Former Presidential candidate, Steve Forbes puts forth a moral case for the Flat Tax. Forbes stresses how the current tax system leads to political, civic and cultural corruption. The current tax code is mind-numbing and complex, according to Forbes, and the leading source of corruption in Washington. Lobbyists and special interest groups are the largest private sector industry in Washington. Over half of them work to convince politicians to manipulate the tax code in their favor. A flat tax would close all loopholes and throw the lobbyists and special interests out of work. An unfair tax code and excessive taxation leads to civic corruption by taking away a citizen's sense of self-reliance and integrity. Many Americans view the current tax structure as "legalized plunder." Forbes points out that this has a corrosive impact on an individual's sense of responsibility and trust, two necessary components for society to thrive. Despite the trillions in American taxpayer money that has been spent in the name of "compassion," there is more crime, more illegitimacy, more illiteracy, more drug abuse, more broken families, and more members of the permanent underclass than ever before. A flat tax that exempts the poorest citizens would help end the cultural corruption that has resulted from failed big-government programs. Forbes concludes by arguing that the federal government cannot provide the moral influence necessary to preserve families, reawaken faith, restore values, solve social problems and create prosperity. 5 pp.  CONTACT: Hillsdale College, Hillsdale, MI 49242, 800/437-2268.

<B>Do Automobile Fuel Economy Standards Work</B>,<br>
 by Michael Sykuta <br>
<I>Policy Study</I> No. 133, Center for the Study of American Business<hr>
<p>
Michael Sykuta, a Research Associate and lecturer in business administration at the Joseph M. Katz Graduate School of Business, argues that automobile fuel economy standards do not work. According to Sykuta, corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards have not achieved their original objective of reducing gasoline consumption. He finds that the United States consumed 40 percent more gasoline than when the CAFE law was passed in 1975. His findings offers evidence that  freeze, if not a repeal, of CAFE standards should take place. Proponents of CAFE regulation argue that standards must be increased to further reduce the consumption of gasoline and its environmental side-effects. However, Sykuta found the following: average passenger vehicles on the road today are 59 percent more fuel efficient than the average cars of 1975 and continued through 1982, not because of CAFE standards, but because changes in product designed that began prior to 1975 as a response to prevailing market forces; the average fuel economy of the total U.S. fleet continued to rise after 1982 as the older and less efficient cars were slowly replaced with the newer more efficient cars, however the average fuel economy of all cars has leveled off in recent years; and, CAFE regulations have not achieved the goal of reducing American consumption of foreign oil. Sykuta reasons from his data covering a 44-year period (1951-1994), that average gasoline consumption per car is most significantly related to the price of gasoline and to the average fuel efficiency of the total U.S. fleet, not just new cars. He argues that, at least through 1982, the price of gasoline, not CAFE standards themselves, is the key determinant of average fuel efficiency. He concludes that federal government attempts to reduce gasoline consumption with a mandated fuel-economy standard shows no sign having an impact on the amount of gasoline consumed on a per vehicle basis. Overall, Cafe regulations have only served to create additional bureaucratic burdens on automobile ma
nufacturers. 22 pp.  CONTACT: Center for the Study of American Business, Washington University, Campus Box 1208, St. Louis, MO 63130-4899, 314/935-5630, fax 314/935-5688.

<b>Community-Run Fisheries: Avoiding the "Tragedy of the Commons"</b>, <br>
 by Donald Leal<br>
<I>PERC Policy Series</I> No. 7, PERC<hr>
<p>
Donald Leal, PERC Senior Associate, discusses how coastal communities can avoid overfishing. He presents several cases where fishing territories have been effectively protected and fish populations preserved through community-run fisheries. Leal mentions early native Alaskan fisheries, and today's ZECs (zones of controlled exploitation) in Quebec. In the examples, he shows that fishing areas can be protected from overfishing with minimal government involvement. Citing studies on well-managed, commonly-owned property, he illustrates that well-defined boundaries, a strong community tradition, and absence of government interference can preserve resources and avoid the "tragedy of the commons." He concludes that government has failed to regulate fishing successfully, and that a self-regulated fishery is an idea whose time has come. 27 pp. CONTACT: Political Economy Research Center, 502 S. 19th Avenue, Suite 211, Bozeman, MT  59715, 406/587-9591, fax 406/586-7555.

<I>State Backgrounder</I> No. 1097/S, The Heritage Foundation<hr>
<p>
James Wootton, President of the Safe Streets Alliance, and Robert Heck, a former Justice Department official, have prepared a study on how state and local officials can fight violent juvenile crime. Wootton and Heck argue that a high-tech approach might be the answer. six percent of hard-core juvenile offenders, or "superpredators" commit up to 63 percent of all violent juvenile crime. According to Wootton and Heck, state and local law enforcement officials should build computerized case files on these criminals and make the information available to every public agency that deals with youth-police, prosecutors, courts, parole officers, schools and social workers. There is already a similar system set up in more than 150 communities across the United States and Canada called Serious Habitual Offender Comprehensive Action Program (SHOCAP). SHOCAP enables state and local law enforcement officials to identify, target, arrest, and incarcerate violent teenage criminals. Wootton and Heck mention that Congress can aid efforts to fight juvenile crime with such legislation as the Violent and Repeat Juvenille Offender Act of 1996, and the Violent Youth Predator Act of 1996. Ultimately, they argue, violent juvenile crime must be fought by smart, tough and tenacious officials at the state and local level with the most efficient and sophisticated resources for tracking the violent habitual offender.  17 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto:Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org,</a>, Internet <a href="http://www.heritage.org">http://www.heritage.org</a>.

<b>Legal Services for the Poor: Is Federal Support Necessary?</b><br>
 by David Wilkinson<br>
<I>Alternatives in Philanthropy</I>, Capital Research Center<hr>
<P>
David Wikenson, former Utah Attorney General, and the first Inspector General of the Legal Services Corporation (1989-91), questions whether the federal government should spend $283 million to fund legal services. The Legal Services Corporation (LSC) is a federally funded agency designed to support legal services organizations that serve the poor. Conservative critics of LSC have charged that LSC funds are improperly used to challenge electoral redistricting plans, represent illegal aliens and drug dealers, and bring class action lawsuits against laws made by elected officials. Liberal supporters of LSC argue that LSC-funded organizations spend most of their resources representing the poor in routine legal cases such as land-lord-tenant disputes. Whatever the case may be, Wilkinson argues, there are adequate private and non-federal resources currently available to meet the legal needs of the poor. Legal service providers receiving LSC funds also receive at least $324 million from private and other public sources. Furthermore, there are an additional 1,350 providers of legal services to the needy who receive no government funding and whose budgets total over $200 million. On top of that there are 400,000 to 600,000 lawyers who perform an estimated 24,000,000 hours of pro bono work each year valued at $3.3 billion. Wilkenson concludes that if Congress is serious about balancing the budget and reducing the role of the federal government, then it may want to reconsider the next LSC budget. If LSC were abolished, there would still be at least a half billion dollars available each year for legal services for the needy. 5 pp.  CONTACT: Capital Research Center, 727 15th Street, N.W., 8th Floor, Washington, DC 20005, 202/393-2600, fax 202/393-2626.

<b>Factories Behind Bars</b>,<br>
 by Morgan Reynolds<br>
<I>Policy Report</I> No. 206, <hr>
<P>
Morgan Reynolds, NCPA Senior Fellow, calls for putting prisoners to work. Currently there are unnecessary legal restrictions keeping tens of thousands of prisoners from doing productive work behind bars. Reynolds proposes repealing the laws that restrict trade in prison-made goods. He also proposes recruiting private-sector businesses to supply jobs, once the restrictive laws are abolished. America's prison population is projected to grow to 1.6 million in the next decade. Only about half of all prisoners do any kind of work at all and most of that is part-time work on prison upkeep. According to Reynolds, it should be possible to create jobs for one of every four prisoners during the next five to ten years. If just 60 percent of prisoner earnings were allocated to compensating taxpayers, this would save about $2.4 billion annually, or slightly less than 10 percent of the cost of prison support. Reynolds points out that there is no reason why prisoners shouldn't help to pay for their own upkeep instead of having taxpayers pay for it all. Beyond taxpayer relief, productive work for prisoners would alleviate idleness in prison life, and increase the likelihood of responsible behavior upon the prisoners release. 29 pp. CONTACT: National Center for Policy Analysis, 12655 N.

<b>Reforming Public Education in Wisconsin: Moving from Bureaucracy to Accountability</b>,<br>

<I>Report</I> Vol. 9, No. 7, Wisconsin Policy Research Institute<hr>
<p>
James Cibulka, Professor and Chair of the Department of Education Policy, Planning and Administration at the University of Maryland, examines what has happened to educational reform in Wisconsin. He finds that Wisconsin's Department of Public Instruction (DPI) is still bogged down with outdated "command-and-control" principles. He points out that while private sector organizations have undergone a "management revolution" achieving much greater efficiency, DPI has not reorganized itself to promote high student performance, local initiative, and accountability for high performance at all levels. Cibulka offers recommendations for improving DPI in three general areas: 1) greater regulatory flexibility; 2) improving accountability policies; and 3) a new approach to state leadership and a state-level partnership. He concludes that a new focus on high performance can be achieved within a system with a tradition of strong local initiative. He calls for a new model for education administration that is a state-local partnership. 23 pp. CONTACT: Wisconsin Policy Research Institute, 3107 North Shepard Avenue, Milwaukee, WI  53211, 414/963-0600, fax 414/963-4230.

<b>1996 Georgia High School Report Card for Parents</b><br> 
Georgia Public Policy Foundation<hr>
<p>
The Georgia Public Policy Foundation (GPPF) has released a "report card" on Georgia public schools. It provides a ranking of every school district in the state. This study attempts do the following: a) analyze the issues that GPPF thinks Georgia parents care most about; b) reduce the available statistical information to a concise and understandable form; c) isolate data from Georgia's public high schools only; and d) issue a publication that is accessible and easily comprehensible to the state's general population. The criteria that they used for ranking the schools were the Test of Achievement and Proficiency (TAP), Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT) scores, the percentage of students completing a college preparatory curriculum (versus a less vigorous curriculum), dropout rates, and, the number of weapons violations per 100 students. GPPF argues that parents are entitled to know about the quality of their children's schools. For the majority of parents, assessing the quality of a school is a mystery shrouded in unfamiliar terms and endless data. GPPF says that this report should be used to open dialogues between parents, teachers, administrators, government officials, and civic organizations. 35 pp. CONTACT: Georgia Public Policy Foundation, 2900 Chamblee-Tucker Road, Building Six, Atlanta, GA 30341-4128, 770/455-7600, fax 770/455-4355.

<b>The End of Welfare: Fighting Poverty in the Civil Society</b>,<br>
 by Michael Tanner<br>
Cato Institute<hr>
<p>
Michael Tanner, Director of Health and Welfare Studies at the Cato Institute, discusses the corrosive effect of U.S. welfare policy, despite its good intentions. He points out that since the start of the War on Poverty in 1965, the federal and state governments have spent more than $5.4 trillion to end poverty. Despite the enormity of this 'investment' the result has been, primarily, more poverty. He argues that our welfare system is unfair to all. Taxpayers must pay the bill for failed programs. Society is hurt when its mediating institutions of community, church and family are increasingly pushed aside. Most of all, argues Tanner, the poor are hurt with welfare by being trapped in a system that destroys opportunity for themselves and destroys hope for their children. Welfare should be judged on its results, not its intentions. Despite the acknowledgment from all sides that the system has failed, Tanner argues, both liberals and conservatives, continue to believe that government can solve the problem of poverty. Tanner maintains that the answer to poverty does not lie with government. He argues that a new paradigm to fight poverty must be based on civil society instead of government or political society. Civil society, "while stressing self-reliance and individual initiative, would also provide a vigorous network of private, localized, nonbureaucratic charities that are far more capable than is government of helping those people who need temporary assistance." Tanner also criticizes the recent welfare reform legislation. According to him, welfare cannot be reformed, and instead, should be ended. He explains why liberal and conservative welfare reform won't work, and he elaborates on how civil society can replace welfare. This book also includes an appendix listing and describing major welfare programs. 225 pp.  CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC  20001, 202/842-0200, fax 202/842-3490, e-mail <a href="mailto: cato@cato.org ">cato@cato.org</a>, Internet <a href=" http://www.

<b>The Tenth Amendment: The Promise of Liberty: Strategies to Restore the Balance of Power Between the Federal and State Governments</b>
American Legislative Exchange Council<hr>
<p>
With this paper, the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), has put forth strategies to restore the balance of power between the federal and state governments that is implied with the Tenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. In October of 1995, ALEC and other organizations, held a national federalism summit to look at ways to restore the Tenth Amendment. The result of the summit was four proposals which, they believe, merit further consideration. 1) Set up a mechanism to provide the people of the states, through their legislatures, the power to require Congress to reconsider laws or regulations that interfere with state authority. 2) Set up a mechanism that would allow the states to propose specific amendments to the U.S. Constitution subject to ratification by the United States Congress. 3) Set up statutory remedies and/or constitutional reforms to address the problems of conditions attached to federal spending grants, regulations and mandates. 4) Passage of a federalism act to enhance the political safeguards and give states a more effective voice in congressional deliberations. For each of these proposals ALEC recommends the following: 1) The National Government of the People Amendment, which would allow state legislatures to repeal intrusive federal legislation and regulations; 2) The States' Initiative, which would empower the People through their state legislature to ratify constitutional amendments that enjoy broad support but that Congress has failed to propose; 3) The Accountability in Government Initiative, which would end the three intrusive federal practices of regulatory mandates, unfunded mandates, and the imposition of impermissible conditions on federal spending grants; and 4) The Federalism Act, which would directly address discrete aspects of the current imbalance between the federal and state governments. 17 pp. CONTACT: American Legislative Exchange Council, 910 17th Street, N.W., 5th floor, Washington, DC  20006, 202/466-3800, fax 202/466-3801.

<b><a href="/heritage/library/categories/govern/bg1094.html">From Meany to Sweeney: Labor's Leftward Tilt</a></b>,<br>
 by Ken Weinstein and August Stofferahn<br>
<I>Backgrounder</I> No. 1094, The Heritage Foundation<hr>
<P>
Ken Weinstein, Director of the Government Reform Project at The Heritage Foundation, and August Stofferahn, Research Assistant at the Government Reform Project, examine organized labor's use of compulsory membership dues to finance their leadership's political agenda. An activist labor movement was a major force in the last election, and may be the most significant new force in American politics. However, Weinstein and Stofferahn point out, much of labor's new agenda has nothing to do with workplace issues, is not generally supported among rank-and-file union members, and is outside of the mainstream of American politics. In the past few decades, organized labor has moved from a relatively centrist political force into a powerful, high-spending lobby for liberal special interests and big government. Weinstein and Stofferahn document labor's move to the left. They illustrate how organized labor has come to be dominated by government employee unions, instead of the traditional industry-based unions. Specifically, they show how the AFL-CIO have drastically departed from American Federation of Labor founder, Samuel Gompers', rule of separating labor from partisan politics. Organized labor has recently taken stances on issues that have nothing to do with collective bargaining and workplace conditions. For example, in 1995 the Director of Community Services for the AFL-CIO led a campaign to force the Boy Scouts of America to include homosexuals and atheists. Organized labor leadership has also taken stances on abortion, racial and gender preferences, welfare and the federal budget. This paper also goes into detail about the epitome of labor's leftward shift and blatant political partisanship, the National Education Association. In their conclusion, Weinstein and Stofferahn, point out that politicking and other non-collective bargaining activities cost the average union member hundreds of dollars per year in dues. They argue that unions should not finance their political activities with compulsory membership dues. The
re is judicial precedent from the 1988 Supreme Court Case <I>Communication Workers of America v. Beck</I>, that declared that union members are entitled to a refund of the portion of their dues used for purposes other than collective bargaining, contract administration, and grievance adjustment. 12 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto:Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org,</a>, Internet <a href="http://www.heritage.org">http://www.heritage.org</a>.

<b>What About the Religious Left? Politics  Motivates and Bankrolls The Interfaith Alliance, Americans United Works to Keep Religion Out of Public Square</b>
<I>Organization Trends</I>, Capital Research Center<hr>
<p>
In recent years the mainstream media has thoroughly covered the "religious right," often times generously quoting those eager to bash them, and implying that their rising influence may corrupt the American political system. <I>Organization Trends</I> points out that left-leaning churches and religious leaders have been involved in American politics long before there was a Christian Coalition. This issue focuses on two groups, the Interfaith Alliance (TIA), and Americans United for the Separation of Church and State. Calling itself a "faith-based" group, TIA engages in the same activism with similar methods as the Christian Coalition. The Interfaith Alliance distributed the same type of voter guides that earned the Christian Coalition criticism for excessive religious influence. Yet, TIA's guides, which ranked liberal candidates better, caused no such outcry. This 501(c)(4) organization was started with Democratic party money, and a look at the organization's leadership and activities uncovers its position clearly within the left of the political and cultural spectrum. This issue also covers the activities of another group having to do with religion and public life, Americans United for the Separation of Church and State. TIA, a self-proclaimed "mainstream faith-based" group, is ironically allied with this group that is dedicated to eradicating the public expression of religion. In September, Americans United launched a national campaign to deter churches from distributing Christian Coalition voter guides, and warning churches that doing so could threaten their tax-exempt status. The issue concludes by observing that TIA apparently has no agenda of its own, other than bashing the Christian Coalition. TIA is most often quoted in the media as a "religious" organization denouncing the Christian Coalition. The author suggests that the liberal left only has a use for TIA because of the activism of religious conservatives. 6 pp. CONTACT: Capital Research Center, 727 15th Street, N.W., 8th Floor, Washington, DC 20005,

<b>The Adoption Option: Compassion that Works</b>,<br>
 by Ken Connor and Camille Godwin<br>
<I>Outside the Lines</I> No. 7, Foundation for Florida's Future<hr>
<p>
Ken Connor, Chairman of the Board of Care Net, which represents the largest network of crisis pregnancy centers in North America, and Camille Godwin, an attorney in Tallahassee, FL, promote the option of adoption in the situation of a "crisis pregnancy." They argue that adoption can be a "win-win" situation for the people affected. The child gains a loving, stable and secure home, the adopting parents win by becoming parents of the child for whom they have longed, and the biological parents obtain the relief from the burdens of an unexpected or unwanted child. Connor and Godwin say that this makes it in the public interest to encourage and facilitate the adoption process. They discuss the current adoption procedures in the State of Florida, the obstacles to adoption, and the disadvantages of foster care. Connor and Godwin put forth several legislative and public policy suggestions to improve the adoption and foster care system: streamline judicial proceedings, increase access to information about adoption, reduce the financial obstacles for prospective parents, remove race as an obstacle to adoption, promote community-based responses to adoption and foster care issues, and encourage employer-based initiatives to promote adoption. They conclude by arguing that adoption must become a priority public policy issue. 14 pp.  CONTACT: Foundation for Florida's Future, 3399 Ponce de Leon Boulevard, P.O.

<hr><p>
<dd>The cover story of this issue, <a href="/heritage/p_review/nov96/shokraii.html">"Free at Last: Black America Signs Up for School Choice</a>," by Nina Shokraii, examines the growing support for school choice amongst African-Americans. Most black political leaders actively oppose vouchers and charter schools, yet their constituents are looking more and more to options other than decaying public schools ---which have a disasterous record of teaching black children. Shokraii, Director of Outreach Programs at the Institute for Justice, documents the school choice movements in black communities in Milwaukee and Cleveland, and charter school movements in California and Michigan. It is quite evident that standards, discipline, and parental involvement of private or charter schools are bringing more black parents to fight for schools choice. Shokraii concludes that school choice and charter schools are becoming the civil rights movement of the 1990s.

<B><I>Crisis</I></B><br>
Novemember 1996<hr><p>
<dd>
A notable article in this month's issue of <I>Crisis</I> discusses the bad economics of the pastoral letter of America's Catholic bishops, <I>Economic Justice for All</I>. Michael Joyce, President and CEO of the Bradley Foundation, contrasts <I>Economic Justice for All</I> with Pope John Paul II's <I>Centesimus Annus</I>. At the core of the comparison is how the respective writings proscribe ways to help those in need. Joyce points out the bishop's pastoral has much to say about the needy, but nothing to say to them. The letter calls for "an economy that truly respects persons," and even proposes measures to be taken by government as specific as a Targeted Jobs Tax Credit Act. It calls for reforming social sytems in order to secure dignity for the needy, yet it never lists an action or task for the needy themselves. Joyce argues that <I>Centesimus Annus</I> cannot be read without a clear sense that the human person, made in the image and likeness of God, is not quite so subordinate. While the Pope acknowledges that there is a need for political, economic, social, and cultural commitment to the poor, he maintains that the decisive commitment must be made within the heart and conscience of the human person and not depend on asking government or other institution to solve the problem. 60 pp.  CONTACT: 800/852-9962.

<B>Competitive Enterprise Institute</B><HR>

<P>
In October, the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) filed a First Amendment challenge to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms' (ATF) ban on statements concerning the cardiovascular benefits of moderate drinking on alcoholic beverage labels and advertisements. A substantial body of research has shown that moderate alcohol consumption significantly reduces the risk of heart disease, the leading cause of death in adults. While these findings are now widely accepted and have been incorporated into the federal government's new edition of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, ATF still prohibits their inclusion on products or advertisements.
<p>
CEI had petitioned ATF in 1995 to allow such statements, and included the following suggested language: "There is significant evidence that moderate consumption of alcoholic beverages may reduce the risk of heart disease." ATF did not respond to the petition. Consumer Alert, a non-profit consumer advocacy group with an interest in the free flow of information to its members and a supporter of the CEI petition, is also a party.
<p>
CEI is relying on an extensive body of Supreme Court precedent protecting so-called commercial speech. Most recently, two Court decisions, <I>Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co.</i> and <I>44 Liquormart Inc. v. Rhode Island</I>, held that information on alcoholic beverage labels and ads is protected by the First Amendment against government restrictions.

<b>Flooding Farm Reveals Government Double Standard</b>
<p>
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) is guilty of using double standards when it comes to its dealings with small farmer Roy James, according to Defenders. Mr. James's farm abuts the Pocosin Lakes National Wildlife Refuge (Tyrrell County, North Carolina). A drainage problem in the refuge causes the farm to flood. Due to the flooding, Mr. James loses at least 40% of the productivity of his farm every year, and suffers further losses from erosion and the cost of paying to have the water pumped off the land. FWS admits to causing the flooding, but simply refuses to resolve the problem.
<p>
Mr. James offered to exchange land with FWS, but FWS declined because the land "does not have significant enough wildlife values to be advantageous." So after two years of flooding, Mr. James had the U.S. Soil Conservation Service draw up specifications for a dike. He built the dike with some fill from the refuge land. Ironically, when the government's land was physically invaded, FWS took immediate action, threatening to sue Mr. James for damages. In fact, Mr. James was forced to compensate the federal government in order to avoid litigation, but has yet to receive a dime from the government for its years-long physical invasion of his land. Defenders is now representing Mr. James seeking damages on his behalf.
<p>
<b>Last Developer in Is a "Rotten Egg"</b>
<p>
A wetland designation by the Army Corps of Engineers has derailed investment-backed expectations of the owners of industrial-zoned property in Centerville, Utah, leaving a handful of property owners with no economically beneficial or productive use of their property.
<p>
The land at issue was purchased by several investors in the early 1970's. The local government zoned the area industrial and encouraged its development as an industrial park. By pooling their resources, the landowners built public roads and other infrastructure, and began to develop their individual lots. After half the lots were develop and Mr. Smith began developing his lot, the Army Corps ordered him to cease because the land, according the government, is now "wetland."
<p>
In fact, however, Mr. Smith's dry land is only wet when rain water runs off the adjacent developed parcels onto his undeveloped parcel. Now that the parcel has been declared a wetland, Mr. Smith faces the unfair reality of not being able to make any beneficial or productive us of his property.
<p>
<b>Sales Contract Canceled Due to Government Interference</b>
<p>
Anyone who still claims that wetland designations do not diminish land values should look closely at the case of <I>Robbins v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers</I>. In 1976, Mrs. Robbins purchased as investment property, 34 acres in Paris, Tennessee to fund her retirement. The land is zoned commercial and lies along the main highway leading to the "Lands Between the Lakes" Park, a popular national tourist destination. Following her husband's death in 1994, Mrs. Robbins decided to sell the property. She had no problem finding a buyer, and the parties executed a sales contract. The purchaser deposited one third of the sales price in escrow to secure the purchase.
<p>
Three days later, the buyer canceled the contract because unbeknownst to Mrs. Robbins, the land is now deemed "wetland." In spite of the fact that the property is surrounded by commercial building and directly abuts a highway, the U.S. Army Corps determined that the property exhibits the characteristics of federal jurisdictional wetlands.
<p>
Mrs. Robbins has asked Defenders to seek compensation for the property on her behalf. Her just compensation claim is based on the fact that the federal wetlands delineation interfered with her contract for sale, reduced the property to nominal value, and destroyed its development potential and marketability.
<p>
<b>97% Open Space Is Not Enough</b>
<p>
Teton County, Wyoming is 97% public land, consisting of Yellowstone National Park, Grand Teton National Park and state lands. Only 3% of the county is privately owned: 1.5% is held by large ranchers and 1.5% (the only developable land in the county) is held by landowners whose families typically hold the land to subdivide for future generations.
<p>
Michael Shidner is one of those property owners. He owns 35 acres, which he planned to divide three ways. Under the latest Teton county comprehensive plan, however, Mr. Shidner will  not be able to subdivide unless he places a conservation easement over 70% of his property. In addition, he must agree to cluster the homes, since the area is considered winter habitat for endangered species.
<p>
Defenders will argue in a lawsuit that the permit conditions violate the Supreme Court's holding in <I>Dolan v. City of Tigard</I>, which requires conditions to be "roughly proportional" to the burden created by the proposed us of the property. The permit condition faced by Mr. Shidner far exceed the burden that a few homes would create in a county that is already 97% open space.

<b>Religious School Choice in Vermont</b>
<p>
On August 26, 1996, IJ filed a lawsuit on behalf of the Chittenden Town School District against the Vermont Department of Education and its commissioner. The Department had denied general state aid to the District because it was prepared to pay tuition to a religious high school among other schools its students attend. (Vermont towns that have no public high schools send all their students to whatever school, public or private, their parents choose.) The issue is whether religious schools can be included in the tuition program.
<p>
The District withdrew its preliminary injunction request and agreed not to pay tuition to the religious schools until it received a favorable ruling from the Superior Court. The Department agreed to send the aid to the District and expedited discovery in the case. The judge stated he would issue his ruling quickly after discovery and briefings were complete. IJ hopes for a declaratory judgment in the District's favor this fall.

<b>Landmark Continues Milwaukee School Choice Defense</b>
<p>
Representing State Representative Annette "Polly" Williams and low income families, Landmark Legal Foundation continues its defense of the Amended Milwaukee Parental Choice Program. The amended program allows families access to religious private schools under the nation's first school choice plan, which Landmark successfully defended in 1991 and 1992. Landmark, joined by other school choice advocates, recently filed papers asking a Wisconsin state court judge to declare the amended program constitutional. The judge likely will rule against the religious school access provision, however, and the issue is certain to be determined in the Wisconsin Supreme Court, hopefully prior to the 1997-98 school year.

<b>Landmark to Appeal Ruling on State-Created Insurance Company</b>
<p>
Landmark Legal Foundation will ask the Missouri Supreme Court to declare unconstitutional a Missouri state-subsidized insurance company. Representing Casualty Reciprocal Exchange ("CRE"), Landmark will tell the Court that the Missouri Employers Mutual Insurance Company ("MEMIC") also unfairly competes with private insurance companies and is a risk to taxpayers because of important financial reserve requirements from which it was exempted by Missouri Director of Insurance Jay Angoff, also a defendant in the lawsuit.
<p>
MEMIC, in its most recent quarterly report, disclosed that it underestimated its 1995 year-end losses and related expenses by more than $11,000,000. 
<p>
MEMIC was created in 1993 by the legislature, which provided MEMIC a $5 million taxpayer-financed loan for the company's startup capital. MEMIC also was given the authority to revenue bonds for additional capitalization -- both in direct violation of Missouri's Constitutional provisions prohibiting the use of state funds for private loans and investment.

<b><i>Adarand</i> Set for Oral Argument</b>
<p>
The landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in <I>Adarand Constructors, Inc v. Pena</I>, won by MSLF on June 12, 1995, has reached the final stage before the Colorado federal district court. The Supreme Court returned the case to Colorado after it "alter(ed) the playing field" regarding the standard to be used in reviewing race-based decision making by Congress. Overturning two earlier decisions, the Supreme Court held that the "strict scrutiny" standard applies to Congress. With the completion of briefing by both parties, the case is scheduled for oral argument on December 20.
<p>
<b>Michigan Property Owners Seek Supreme Court Review</b>
<p>
Two lake front property owners in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan have asked the Supreme Court to review a lower court holding left undisturbed by the 7-7 split of the entire U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. In <I>Stupak-Thrall, et al. v. United States of America, et al</I>., the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) denied two lake front property owners the right to use the entire surface of Crooked Lake, as Michigan law permits them. This despite the language of applicable federal law that "valid existing rights" are protected. On behalf of the property owners, who MSLF have represented since they first filed their lawsuit, MSLF sought Supreme Court review asserting that the USFS has rendered the "valid existing rights" language "meaningless" and that the federal government's use of the Property Clause to regulate private property is contrary to Supreme Court precedent.
<p>
<b>Babbitt's Park Service Goes Back to Drawing Board</b>
<p>
After MSLF's victory on behalf of commercial climbers, the National Park Service (NPS) has obtained the permission of the Wyoming federal district court to return to the drawing board to determine how it may implement President Clinton's Executive Order regarding regulating federal land for Native American religions. MSLF had obtained a preliminary injunction preventing the NPS from closing Devils Tower in northeastern Wyoming to commercial climbing. Regardless of the NPS decision, MSLF will return to court to seek damages for its client and to prevent other Establishment Clause violations within the Monument.

<b>Clinton Plan to Empty Idaho Reservoir in Jeopardy</b>
<p>
The National Marine and Fisheries Service plan to empty a reservoir in northern Idaho, ostensibly to "save" the salmon was dealt a blow in federal district court when the court requested further briefing on whether the specific statute creating the dam controlled over the general Endangered Species Act (ESA). The controversy is in Clearwater County, Idaho, where the government is seeking to drain a reservoir created by Congress for power generation, recreation, and timber transport. The government says those purposes are subservient to the command of the ESA.

<b>Local Law Enforcement Conscripted into Federal Service</b>
<p>
Named after former White House Press Secretary James Brady, the Brady Act requires a five-day waiting period for handgun purchases and background checks on gun buyers during that period to determine whether there is any legal reason to stop the sale. Theoretically, this law addresses the salutary purpose of keeping guns out of the hands of would-be robbers and murderers. But in reality, the Brady Act goes far beyond that purpose and conscripts local law enforcement officers into federal service, forcing them to compromise their local responsibilities by engaging in time-consuming, costly, and futile paper work for the federal government. What is more, no financial reimbursement is made.
<p>
Background checks under Brady go beyond felons. The law also applies to anyone who may be "otherwise prohibited by law from buying a gun." That means local sheriffs and chiefs of police must search through medical records to determine if a gun buyer has ever been committed to a mental institution or is an illegal drug user who has evaded arrest. Law enforcement officers must also check the records of fugitives, dishonorable military discharges and expatriate citizens. Civil court records must also be checked for restraining orders imposed on spouses in domestic relations cases. As if impressing local officers into federal service was not enough, the law includes an unconscionable provision that could subject them to fine or imprisonment or both for failing to make a "reasonable effort" to complete the work for the federal government.
<p>
The Brady Act's unfunded mandate was the "last straw" for Ravalli County, Montana, Sheriff Jay Printz and Graham County, Arizona, Sheriff Richard Mack, both of whom are being shut into their offices and tied to their desks to complete the background check requirement. These law enforcement officials would much rather devote their resources to protecting the citizens than doing bureaucratic paper work-of questionable efficacy-for the federal government.
<p>
Both Sheriffs Printz and Mack sued and won trial court rulings striking down that position of the Brady Act requiring background checks. In both cases, the lower courts agreed that the law illegally commandeered local officials for a federal program. However, the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed those decisions ruling that the Brady law's background check requirement is constitutional and its intrusion upon state sovereignty minimal. The sheriffs' appeals are now before the U.S. Supreme Court. Pacific Legal Foundation is arguing that the federal government has no constitutional authority to force local law enforcement officers to carry out a mandate that materially impairs their ability to serve the local citizens whom they were hired to protect.
<p>
<b>Farmers Forced to Advertise Competitor's Products</b><br>
<I>Glickman v. Wileman Brothers & Elliot, Inc.</I>
<p>
According to Thomas Jefferson, "to compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of ideas which he disbelieves is sinful and tyrannical." So why does Wileman Brothers & Elliot, Inc., a peach and nectarine grower in California, pay lots of hard-earned money to help pay for a generic advertising message that says its competitors' fruits are as good as its own? Because the federal government is forcing this grower to.
<p>
Government "marketing boards," which essentially are agriculture cartels made up of farmers appointed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, have vast discretionary powers and can punish farmers who don't abide by their edicts. One of the boards' dubious functions is to force farmers to subsidize generic advertisements that extol the virtues of certain commodities in general. Remember the dancing raisins, "Got Milk?" and "It's the Cheese" ads? Such campaigns were financed through mandatory fees paid by individual growers. According to <i>Forbes</i> magazine, commodity boards for agricultural products have raked in over $750 million a year from U.S. farmers through coerced contributions. (The government pays out an additional $90 million of taxpayers' money for overseas promotions.) In California, about 50 such boards collect some $125 million from growers yearly.
<p>
Where do government bureaucrats get the idea in the first place that it is their job to tell business owners how to promote their own products? Forcing producers of agricultural commodities to pay for generic commercial ads is antithetical to the principle of free market enterprise. It is also a blatant violation of the constitutional free speech right not to be forced to pay for messages with which one disagrees. This is why Pacific Legal Foundation is helping Wileman Brothers & Elliot challenge the government's mandatory fee program in the U.S. Supreme Court. Pursuant to federal regulations and marketing orders, Wileman must pay an assessment for a generic advertising program with which it disagrees. Moreover, the payments reduce Wileman's ability to pursue its own individual advertising program.
<p>
PLF argued to the U.S. Supreme Court last week to strike down the government's "marketing order" that assesses small farmers to pay for government-concocted advertising programs.

<b>Supreme Court Hears Oral Arguments in Parents' Rights Case</b>
<p>
The Supreme Court has heard oral arguments in a case that could have a considerable impact on parents' rights. In <i>M.L.B. v. S.L.J.</i>, the court will consider whether a state court can condition an appeal for the termination of parents' rights on their ability to pay court costs in excess of $2,000.00.
<p>
In the case, a Mississippi lower court terminated a mother's parental rights to her 7 and 9-year-old children. She appealed the case to the state Supreme Court but could not afford to pay the costs involved. The court refused to waive the fee and dismissed her case. The Supreme Court must now decide if parents' rights are, in fact, fundamental liberties.
<p>
<b>California's Policy Restricting Employees' Religious Expression Unconstitutional Says Ninth Circuit</b>
<p>
The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled that a California state agency's policy against religious advocacy and display of religious artifacts is unconstitutional. The ruling reverses the finding of the lower court.
<p>
The Rutherford Institute represented state employee Monte Tucker, who placed "By Monte Tucker, SOTLJC" in a computer screen program he designed. The acronym stands for "Servant of the Lord Jesus Christ." Tucker's supervisor threatened him with suspension if he refused to remove the acronym. The department then issued a policy forbidding religious advocacy during work hours and storage or display of any religious artifacts except n closed offices.
<p>
<b>The Rutherford Institute to File Class Action Suit Against Dept. Of Health 
and Human Services</b>
<p>
The Rutherford Institute has filed a class action lawsuit against Donna Shalala and the Department of Health and Human Services for allowing county officials to profit from depriving disabled foster children of their rightful monies.
<p>
The suit alleges that the Department of Health and Human Service has violated federal law by failing to follow the Social Security Act's mandates to ensure that foster children receive their rightful benefits. This policy has in essence encouraged Contra Costa County to prevent handicapped children from being adopted in order to keep funds intended for foster children. The suit claims that he violations occurring in Contra Costa County are indicative of foster care in other counties nationwide.

<p>
<b>Commercial Free Speech Defended</b>
<p>
In <I>AAA v. Kessler</I>, a lawsuit brought by a consortium of advertising groups challenging the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) regulations of tobacco advertising, WLF filed a brief arguing that the regulations imposed by FDA violated the First Amendment rights of advertisers and the adult public. FDA's regulations, announced on August 28, 1996, and set to begin taking effect in early 1997, impose sweeping restrictions on tobacco advertising, including: (1) requiring black and white, text-only advertisements in all media, i.e., billboards, print media, point of purchase, and direct mail, except on those locations or print media that are "adult-only;" (2) prohibiting billboards within 1000 feet of schools or play areas, effectively eliminating all billboards in urban areas; and (3) banning the use of any tobacco brand name in sponsoring any cultural, sporting, or musical event, and on all types of secondary product, such as t-shirts, umbrellas, lighters, etc. WLF argued that the regulations are unlawful because the government has available to it several obvious and non-speech related methods to attack the problem of youth smoking. Moreover, even if some restrictions on advertising could be lawful, the broad and sweeping restrictions imposed by FDA are not "narrowly tailored" to the harm they were intended to address and would primarily restrict the free speech rights of adults. FDA cannot properly, for example, ban the use of tobacco brand names to sponsor all sporting or cultural events when many of these events have minimal, if any, children in attendance. WLF's clients on the brief include race car drivers, Mario Andretti, Don Garlits, Al Unser, Rusty Wallace, and Cale Yarborough, U.S. Representatives Richard Burr, Cass Ballenger, Howard Coble, and David Funderburk, and U.S. Senator Lauch Faircloth.
<p>
<b>Excessive Antitrust Penalty Challenged</b>
<p>
WLF filed a brief with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit arguing that a $10 million fine imposed on a family-owned bakery company that kept its bread prices below the national average during the relevant period should be set aside as grossly excessive and unlawful. In <i>United States v. Mrs. Baird's Bakeries</i>, the evidence was undisputed that, during the time of the alleged pricing conspiracy, Mrs. Baird's bakery held prices steady and, indeed, even reduced its prices on several occasions. Despite this, Texas federal Judge Jerry Buchmeyer imposed the maximum statutory fine, one of the largest antitrust fines in U.S. history. Mrs. Baird's is now in bankruptcy. In its brief, WLF argued that there was little evidence of price fixing, and that the district court misapplied the Sentencing Guidelines in imposing the maximum fine.
<p>
<b>Objection to HUD's Rulemaking</b>
<p>
WLF filed formal comments with the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) requesting that HUD immediately rescind an interim rule that would abolish the right of respondents in fair housing complaint proceedings to obtain discovery from witnesses and the complaining party. The interim rule is procedurally and substantively defective on a number of grounds. HUD flagrantly violated the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) and its own policy by not publishing the interim rule as a proposed rule for public comment. WLF also took strong objection to HUD's primary rationale for abolishing rights of respondents, namely that it would expedite the investigation process. WLF research discovered that the main cause of delay is <i>agency</i> inefficiency; it takes HUD, on average, 53 days from the time a housing complaint is filed until HUD even <i>begins</i> an investigation.

<b><i>Consumer Product Safety Commision Monitor</i> Launched by Consumer Alert </b>
<p>
Consumer Alert has launched a new publication called <i>CPSC Monitor</i>. It is a series of fax newsletters covering the activities of the Consumer Product Safety Commision (CPSC). The purpose of the series is to educate the public about CPSC actions that negatively impact consumers.

<b>Lecture Series to Examine the Impact of Religious Conviction on Politics</b>
<p>

The Foreign Policy Institute, Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) and the Ethics and Public Policy Center will sponsor a lecture series to examine "The Impact of Religious Conviction on the Politics of the 21st Century." All lectures will be held at SAISin Washington. The purpose of the series is to assess evidence of a worldwide resurgence in religious belief and to reflect on the implications of such a development at the end of the current millennium. Specifically, the project will address the following questions: What are the origins of the revival of religious fervor at the end of the 20th Century? How far and how long will this revival go? What are the chief elements of the critique of the secular order mounted by the various religions and ethical traditions enjoying a resurgence of popularity? To what degree are the religion-based critques rooted in common assumptions and compatible responses to the perceived shortcomings of secularity? What are the implications of this phenomenon particularly as they relate to international politics: prospects of war and peace, economic development, and the definition of human rights and social justice?

<TITLE>Third Wave of Think Tanks -- October 1996 Insider - Heritage</TITLE>
<center><img src="/heritage/thf_log2.gif"><br><p>
<h3>October, 1996 <i>Insider</i></h3></center> 



<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>Third Wave of Think Tanks<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER><HR>


<P>
<dd> Tip O'Neill once said &quot;All politics is local.&quot; He was
correct, but failed to mention an important corollary, that all
policy is local too. That's why we have formed the Allegheny Institute
for Public Policy -- the nation's first think tank devoted exclusively
to bringing free market solutions to local government.
<P>
<dd> Market oriented think tanks have come in three distinct waves.
In the 1970s, they began operating in Washington and laying the
intellectual groundwork for the Reagan revolution. In the 1980s,
in keeping with Reagan's revived spirit of federalism, conservative-movement
dollars and energies started working in the states as well. Intellectual
capital was &quot;block granted,&quot; as a number of entrepreneurial
policy analysts left Washington to found the second wave of policy
research groups. These state-based think tanks went on to provide
the intellectual infrastructure for the reinvention of state governments
in places like Tommy Thompson's Wisconsin, Tom Ridge's Pennsylvania,
Bill Weld's Massachusetts, and John Engler's Michigan. These groups
put welfare reform, charter schools and school choice on the public
policy map.
<P>
<dd> The time has come for a third wave -- the formation of locally-oriented
think tanks.  As dollars devolve from Washington to local governments,
taxpayer accountability should devolve as well. It would be ironic
if at the same time sound economic principles are revived in Washington,
that government programs might avoid accountability to these principles
by escaping to local bureaucracies still mired in the 1960s model
of big government.
<P>
<dd> Even before the devolution revolution, more dollars were spent
by local governments than by states or the federal government.
As devolution progresses this will become more true. Even federal
and state programs are frequently administered by local governments,
or by local subdivisions. Domestic government programs are ultimately
applied at the local level.
<P>
<dd> Although the Allegheny Institute is the first of this third wave
of local policy advocacy, it is unlikely to be the last. After
less than one year in business, we were approached by a group
from California interested in forming a similar organization modeled
after the Allegheny Institute. Due to the hard work of founder
Don Blake and others, and a little guidance from us, California
now has the benefit of the Table Mountain Institute near Sacramento.
Requests for help in starting local think tanks have come from
other places even farther away than Sacramento-Nigeria and Italy
for example. In addition we have received requests for advice
from several state think tanks that wish to start local policy
projects in their home states. Furthermore, our ideas have been
cited by all three local network television affiliates, all the
local radio news outlets and talk shows, and the local newspapers,
as well as the CBS radio network, and national newspapers such
as <I>USA Today</I> and the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>.
<P>
 <dd>Why all the attention? It has come largely because of our close
involvement in the restructuring of the government of Pittsburgh's
Allegheny County. This county, the second largest local government
between New York and Chicago, was under the rule of liberals for
over 60 years. In the last election, two conservatives won on
a privatization and deregulation platform. The crown jewel of
their platform was a 20% tax cut their first day in office.
<P>
<dd> The only way to make large tax cuts that work is to force the
bureaucracy to compete with the private sector to see who can
achieve the most efficient service delivery. This form of privatization
is sometimes called managed competition. Drawing upon research
by the Reason Foundation, we have published extensive research
on the benefits of privatization. In fact, there are over a dozen
privatization initiatives being implemented right now in Allegheny
County, including the only privatization of a property-assessments
department in the country and the first full privatization (sale)
of an airport in U.S. history.
<P>
 <dd>It's not just about privatization, but about harnessing markets
in other ways. We are engaged in the creation of a pilot program
for electricity de-regulation. We estimate that a full-scale electric
utility consumer choice program could add 5 or 6% to the regional
domestic product. In addition, we are working with the county
economic development department to quantify the amount of burden
placed on the economy by local government, with a view toward
a streamlined business-friendly permitting process.
<P>
 <dd>It's not just about markets either, it's also about culture.
Working with Robert Woodson of the National Center for Neighborhood
Enterprise we are helping to shift social service programs from
the political society to the civil society, to remove a permissive,
redistributive, liberal, social-service bureaucracy and replace
it with a flexible, results-oriented, low-cost provider network.
<P>
 <dd>Less a &quot;think tank&quot; and more a &quot;do tank,&quot;
the Allegheny Institute is taking the conservative intellectual
revolution to the laboratory of real life. Not satisfied with
having produced 30 full-length reports (and 40 editions of our
Newsfax) in our first year and a half of operations, the Allegheny
Institute has set out to prove not only that &quot;ideas have
consequences,&quot; but that <I>conservative</I> ideas actually
work at the local level.

by John Sweeney
<P>
<I>Backgrounder</I> No. 1092, The Heritage Foundation<HR>

<P>
Heritage Policy Analyst John Sweeney argues that since Mexico's
economic meltdown in 1994, both the Clinton Administration and
the 104th Congress have allowed America's once-respected leadership
role in Latin America to erode. The Administration and the Congress
have been reluctant to put expansion of NAFTA on the fast track
and instead have allowed the tremendous foreign policy successes
of the Reagan and Bush administrations to fall apart. If this
retreat is allowed to continue, writes Sweeney, U.S. economic
and security interests in the region could suffer a &quot;sustained
decline.&quot; 15 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage

<I>On the Issues</I>, American Enterprise Institute<HR>

<P>
Joshua Muravchik, Resident Scholar at the American Enterprise
Institute, argues that the Clinton Administration's foreign policy
is misguided and that this has lead to the erosion of American
military supremacy. According to Muravchik, Clinton's foreign
policy has been a &quot;jumble of improvised responses to crises
and to foreign and domestic political pressures and calculations
of electoral advantage.&quot; The author writes that Clinton nearly
doubled his proposed defense cuts so he could appear to look like
he is reducing the budget deficit, while not having to reduce
domestic spending. A symbol of Clinton's low priority given to
defense is his order for sharp reductions in the development of
strategic defenses. Muravchik also argues that Clinton's policy
with China, North Korea, Serbia, and Somalia, have substantially
hurt America's credibility abroad. Overall, Muravchik concludes,
Clinton's tenure as Commander and Chief has narrowed the wide
margin of security that came about with the demise of America's
Cold War rival. 4 pp. CONTACT: American Enterprise Institute,

<B>The World Bank's Procurement Myth, <BR>
</B>by John Thibodeau
<P>
<I>Foreign Policy Briefing</I> No. 43, Cato Institute<HR>

<P>
John Thibodeau, Director of Research at Probe International, a
Canadian environmental group, reports that the World Bank's soft-loan
window, the International Development Association (IDA), is losing
many contributions due to its failed projects and the bank's increasingly
risky loan portfolio. The United States recently decided not to
contribute any new money to IDA in 1997, with any future funding
beyond that uncertain. Thibodeau argues that the World Bank has
launched a misleading public relations campaign to convince Congress
and the American public that U.S. taxpayers' contributions to
IDA are beneficial to the American economy. The World bank says
that such contributions are returned in the form of contracts
for U.S. companies. In reality, Thibodeau points out, U.S. firms
receive only about $0.23 in contracts for each $1.00 the United
States contributes to IDA. The IDA gets billions of taxpayer dollars
for bad projects and pork-barrel contracts for a few American
firms. Thibodeau concludes that Congress and lawmakers from other
donor countries should see through the World Bank's desperate
attempt to seek more funds and refuse to waste their constituent's
tax dollars on IDA in 1997 and beyond. 17 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute,

<B>The Innovation Age: A New Perspective on the Telecom Revolution,

<P>
Hudson Institute<HR>

<P>
Peter Pitsch, Adjunct Fellow at the Hudson Institute, and the
former Chief of Staff and Chief of Planning at the Federal Communications
Commission, shows why the United States cannot maintain its preeminent
position in information technology unless it reforms a number
of outdated regulatory restraints. Pitsch shows how artificial
regulations on a market, such as telecommunications, stifles the
progress and productivity that innovations were designed to stimulate.
Pitsch illustrates the superiority of a market-based approach
to regulation, and uses the theories of Austrian school economists
Hayek and Schumpeter to point out the flaws of planned economies.
Overall, Pitsch creates a positive image of what the future can
hold with an open-road policy toward the telecom industry. 120

<B>Lights Out on Federal Power: Privatization for the 21st Century,
</B><br>
by Michael Block and Rep. John Shadegg
<P>
<I>Future Insight</I>, Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation<HR>

<P>
Michael Block, Senior Fellow at the Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation,
and John Shadegg, United States Congressman from Arizona, urge
the privatization of federally owned power facilities. Power Marketing
Administrations (PMAs) were created during the New Deal to provide
a supply of inexpensive power to impoverished rural areas. Block
and Shadegg argue that demographic changes since the 1930s mean
that many of the areas deemed in need of subsidized power are
no longer rural or undeveloped. They argue that PMAs force taxpayers
to provide subsidized power to the rich, and they distort and
hinder competition and productivity in the electric energy market.
Block and Shadegg outline how the federal government should sell
three PMAs. Selling off this large source of frozen assets would
generate nearly $4.5 billion, and help reduce the budget deficit.
Finally, to overcome interest-group oppostion to PMA privatization,
they propose that the current consumers of PMA power be given
the option to purchase shares in the newly privatized PMAs. 7

<B>Ten Thousand Commandments: A Policymaker's Snapshot of the

<I>Regulatory Reform Project</I>, <BR>
Competitive Enterprise Institute<HR>

<P>
Clyde Wayne Crews, CEI Fellow in Regulatory Studies, illustrates
that compliance with federal regulations, which are officially
off-budget, have quietly expanded into costs greater than the
entire GNP of Canada. According to Crews, regulatory costs absorb
almost 20% of the average family's after-tax budget. Politicians
can avoid accountability for more expenses to taxpayers by passing
mandates and regulations that transfer costs to business and consumers
and are not reflected in the budget. Crews warns that a Balance
Budget Amendment may pressure Congress to push even further regulations
that put costs off-budget. He calls for Congress to establish
rules that new agency regulations require Congressional approval,
and to establish a limited regulatory budget. Overall, Crews calls
for making regulatory costs as transparent as direct taxes, and
ensuring that Congress bears direct accountability for every dollar
that agency regulations cost voters. 23 pp. CONTACT: Competitive

<B>A Revolution in Regulation: New York Must Treat Employers as
Customers to Compete for the Growth and Jobs We Need</B>
<P>
Public Policy Institute of New York State<HR>

<P>
New York's regulatory bureaucracy is a primary reason that the
state has an image of being hostile to business-and a record of
losing jobs to other locations. In addition to the hassle of overwhelming
amounts of red tape, these regulations can hurt or even shut down
businesses by imposing prohibitive fees, fines and taxes. Employers
must be treated as customers if New York is to compete for the
jobs and growth it needs, according to the Public Policy Institute.
The Institute recommends several steps to achieve regulatory reform,
arguing that key draft regulations should be rewritten before
they become additional burdens to companies. Also, needless regulatory
costs imposed by the Labor Department and the workers' compensation
system should be eliminated. Overall, the report recommends the
laws that limit the powers and responsibilities of regulators
should be enforced, and innovative use of new technologies to
achieve regulatory goals should be allowed to happen. 67 pp. CONTACT:

<B>Regulatory Costs in Profile, </B><br>
by Thomas Hopkins
<P>
<I>Policy Study</I> No. 132, Center for the Study of <BR>
American Business<HR>

<P>
Thomas Hopkins, Adjunct Fellow at the Center for the Study of
American Business, illustrates the vast extent of regulatory costs
in virtually every segment of the U.S. economy. 60 different federal
agencies enact and enforce countless regulations that result in
hidden compliance costs of $668 billion annually. In this book,
Hopkins presents estimates of annual private-sector compliance
costs with federal regulation for 1977 through 2000, and focuses
on the differences in compliance costs among firms. The figures
show that regulatory compliance costs facing all U.S. businesses
rose by $10 billion or more annually in the four years ending
in 1992 after a decade in which such costs generally moved downward.
With the figures presented in this book, Hopkins hopes to bring
a better understanding of the scope and incidence of compliance
costs to help facilitate a more rational debate about the role
and effects of government agency regulations. 25 pp. CONTACT:

<B>Capital Versus Labor? The Dubious Economics of Class Conflict,
</B><br>
by Alan Reynolds
<P>
<I>Hudson Briefing Paper</I>, No. 195, Hudson Institute<HR>

<P>
Alan Reynolds, Director of Economic Research at Hudson Institute,
responds to the recent mood of hostility toward investors, property
owners, and corporate managers in recent press commentary on the
U.S. economy. Such hostility, according to Reynolds, seems to
be an encouragement toward class warfare between &quot;workers&quot;
and &quot;shareholders.&quot; He argues that the data contradicts
the assertions that workers and shareholders are  natural adversaries.
He points out that workers benefit only when productivity increases,
and that productivity depends on capital investment, which depends
on saving. It is punitive tax policies that explain the recent
sluggish productivity growth that has brought stagnation in employee
wages and compensation. Overall, Reynolds argues, the economy
needs more, not less capital, and the only way to end the stagnation
of employee wages is to decrease punitive tax rates against saving
and investing. 9 pp.  CONTACT: Hudson Institute, Herman Kahn Center,

<B>An Analysis of the Dole-Kemp Tax Cuts, <BR>
</B>by Gary Robbins and Aldona Robbins
<P>
<I>Issue Brief</I>, Institute for Policy Innovation<HR>

<P>
Gary Robbins and Aldona Robbins, Senior Research Fellows at the
Institute for Policy Innovation, examine the proposed Dole-Kemp
tax cuts. Their analysis finds that the Dole-Kemp plan would boost
the U.S. real growth rate by roughly one-half a percentage point
over the next six years. They scored the proposed tax plan using
both static and dynamic methods. After adjusting for greater incentives
to work, save and invest, the economy, according to Robbins and
Robbins, would be 4.5 percent larger than it would have been without
the tax cuts, and would produce about 2.8 million new jobs. The
growth would offset 35 percent of the $551.3 billion static revenue
loss between 1997 and 2002. A standard distributional analysis
shows that 60 percent of the Dole-Kemp tax cuts would go to taxpayers
earning under $100,000. They also found that although the people
with the lowest 20 percent of incomes pay less than one percent
of federal income taxes, they would receive the greatest percentage
boost of after tax income in higher wages. 16 pp.  CONTACT: The

<I>Special Report</I>, Washington Research Council<HR>

<P>
In 1988, the Washington Research Council made a systematic review
of Washington's state taxes, and found the tax system to be fundamentally
sound. Since then, however, there have been a number of changes
in tax rates and bases. This paper, updates WRC's review of the
state tax system using five criteria: economic neutrality, fairness,
administrative simplicity, transparency, and stability. The report
 also provides a history of Washington's state taxes, including
a list of major tax events from 1889 to the present to show how
the state's tax structure has changed over the years. 20 pp. CONTACT:

<B>Public Subsidies, Private Gain: Stop Violating the Oregon Constitution,
</B><br>
by Professor Dale Rubin
<P>
<I>Fiscal Insight</I>, No. 13, Cascade Policy Institute<HR>

<P>
Dale Rubin, Professor of Law at Willamette University, examines
how public subsidies lead to private gain, and how this procedure
violates the Oregon Constitution. He points out that legislators
explain that public expenditures that directly benefit private
individuals, such as professional sports teams, are legal because
they are extended for a &quot;public purpose.&quot; Rubin argues
that this response is simply wrong. He explains that the Public
Purpose Doctrine was not made in order to provide legislators
an excuse to spend taxpayer dollars on whatever project they choose.
In fact, the Oregon Constitution contains clear and unambiguous
clauses that explicitly prohibit the legislature and political
subdivisions from giving any aid to private individuals or corporations.
Rubin argues that the courts' misuse of the Public Purpose Doctrine
has made it possible for public entities to spend public dollars
on almost any private project despite a specific constitutional
prohibition. Rubin argues that the constitutional provisions prohibiting
the commingling of public and private funds have been rendered
meaningless by modern court decisions. 11 pp.  CONTACT: Cascade

<B>The Prisoners of Charity: Welfare 'Reforms' in New York Have Done Little to Break the Cycle of Dependency</B>
<P>
Public Policy Institute of New York State<HR>

<P>
The Public Policy Institute finds that welfare reforms in New
York have done too little to break the cycle of dependency of
its recipients. After Congress enacted legislation in 1988 intended
to move welfare recipients into the workforce, New York took an
expensive detour to implement legislation that emphasized &quot;back-to-school&quot;
rather than &quot;back-to-work.&quot; These programs were a failure
and caused the percentage of welfare recipients in the job market
to actually drop. The Public Policy Institute argues that in order
for any welfare-to-work strategy to be successful it, must incorporate
programs that make work pay. They also argue that private sector
jobs need to be made to look more attractive compared to welfare
benefits. While raising the minimum wage reduces the number of
entry level jobs, lowering welfare benefits could send more people
into the shelter system-at a greater cost financially and personally.
Instead, the Institute suggests a &quot;fill-in-the-gap&quot;
approach that allows more wages to be kept before welfare benefits
are reduced. They conclude that overall successful reforms will
begin when it is acknowledged that the poor want to, and can,
take responsibility for their future. The report includes a foreword
by United States Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan. 47 pp. CONTACT:

<B>Arizona's Charter Schools: A Survey of Teachers</B>
<P>
<I>Arizona Issue Analysis</I> No. 141, Goldwater Institute<HR>

<P>
During the Spring of 1996, the Goldwater Institute conducted its
second annual Charter School Survey. The first survey was directed
at parents. The latest survey was aimed at charter school teachers.
Arizona is home to approximately 30 percent of the nation's 350
charter schools. Approximately 16,000 students will attend such
a school during the 1996-97 school year. The results of this survey
tell a great deal about these charter schools, including teachers,

<I>Dialogue</I> No. 16, Pioneer Institute<HR>

<P>
This paper is the transcript of a forum sponsored by the Pioneer
Institute on the state and direction of the Boston Public School
System. The forum included these four panelists: James Peyser,
Executive Director of the Pioneer Institute, and member of the
State Board of Education; Neil Sullivan, Executive Director of
the Boston Private Industry Council; Kristen McCormack, charter
school founder and former head of Federated Dorchester Neighborhood
Houses; and Edwin Melendez, Member of the Boston School Committee,
and Director of the Mauricio Gaston Institute at the University
of Massachusetts/Boston. In the opening remarks given by James
Peyser, the failure of school reform is blamed on the underlying
structural defect of public schools-the monopoly power of school
districts. He also argues that spending priorities have been out
of line. While real per-pupil spending has rise by 53 percent
from 1967 to 1991, only 4 percent of it went to regular education-the
core of schools. He argues that public school education priorities
have been driven by politics rather than the needs of the students,
the desires of parents, or the strategies of educators. Peyser
lays out a plan for structural reform of the Boston Public School
System in which there will be a system of schools, rather than
a unitary school system, that will place parents, students and
educators at the center, and will end the political and bureaucratic
constraints that have made past reform efforts fail. 11 pp. CONTACT:

in School,</a> </B><br>
by Dorothy Hanks
<P>
<I>F.Y.I.</I> No. 120, The Heritage Foundation<HR>

<P>
Dorothy Hanks, Research Assistant at The Heritage Foundation,
examines how the Milwaukee School Choice Program, enacted in 1990,
has helped poor children succeed in school. Milwaukee's program
was the nation's first publicly funded school choice program,
and gave low-income parents vouchers to send their children to
private schools. Hanks relays the findings of a recent assessment
of the program by Professors Jay P. Greene of the University of
Houston Center for Public Policy, and Paul E. Petersen of Harvard
University's Program in Education Policy and Governance. Their
study reveals that the reading scores of choice students were
3 to 5 percentile points higher in their third and fourth years,
respectively, than those of comparable low-income public school
students. On math scores, Greene and Petersen found that choice
students were 5 and 12 percentile point higher for the third and
fourth years respectively. Hanks explains, in detail, how the
study was performed, and how it corrected the methodological errors
of previous studies on the subject of school choice. She also
lists a number of other bodies of research that back up the Houston-Harvard
analysis on the value of private schools among urban poor and
minority students. In the conclusion, Hanks emphasizes that the
success of Milwaukee school choice is now a matter of record,
and that it is time for state legislators and members of Congress
to allow low-income children to escape the failing urban public
schools. 5 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation,

<P>
Despite the presence of serious flaws in current environmental
laws, conservatives have failed to develop a coherent vision of
how these laws ought to be reformed, writes John Shanahan, Environmental
Policy Analyst at the Heritage Foundation. Instead, the debate
about reform usually results in conservatives being falsely characterized
as &quot;anti-environmental.&quot; Shanahan offers an examination
of how conservative critics of our existing environmental policy
can better emphasize the good intentions of present law, and at
the same time, argue for elimination of the sometimes senseless
and oppressive regulations that burden the economy. He shows how
liberal policies have brought little in return for exorbinant
costs, and calls for tapping into the powerful forces and positive
incentives of the market and property ownership-incentives that
reward responsible behavior. Shanahan concludes that Americans
can protect the environment more effectively while simultaneously
increasing economic freedom and growth. 11 pp.  CONTACT: Chris

Robert Whelan, Assistant Director of the Health and Welfare Unit

examine the religious pitfalls of an unqualified embrace of environmentalism.
The authors recognize the necessity of protecting the environment,

to the Christian tradition in its views of God, human beings and
animals. The authors challenge the radical environmentalist ideology

<P>
This issue of <I>Briefly</I> focuses on the impact of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The act was passed last
year over the veto of President Clinton, and is aimed at ending
the worst abuses of securities class actions. Included are four
panel speeches discussing different aspects of the Act. The first,
by Edward Yodowitz, a Securities Defense Litigator at Skadden
Arps, discusses proportionate liability, pleadings and motions,
and the safe-harbor provision of the new Act. Next, Mark Gitenstein,
a strategist in the Act's passage, warns about a California ballot-initiative
which threatens to reverse the good done by the Act. Howard Krongard,
former General Counsel of Deloitte &amp; Touche, examines the
impact of the Act on the accountant/client relationship. Finally,
Steven Toll gives a plaintiff's perspective. The transcript of
the discussion session following the panelists prepared remarks

Fenster and Teufel argue that the U.S. Supreme Court's <I>Winstar</I>

Now More Than Ever, <BR>
</B>by Doug Bandow
<P>
<I>Policy Analysis</I>, No. 259, Cato Institute<HR>

<P>
The issue of term limits will be on fifteen different state ballots
in November. The initiatives are designed to overturn last year's
Supreme Court decision that voided federal term limits. Doug Bandow,
Senior Fellow at the Cato Institute, argues that term limits are
needed, but, that the only way to achieve them is by a constitutional
amendment. Since Congres is unlikely to voluntarily approve one,
Term-limits supporters need to convince 34 states to call for
a convention to draft an appropriate amendment. Bandow believes
that if the states call for a convention that it would encourage
Congress to propose an amendment, in the same way that the Seventeenth
amendment came about.  16 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts

Barry Maley, Director of the <I>Taking Children Seriously </I>program
of the Centre for Independent Studies, discusses the importance
of marriage despite the fact that legal, economic and cultural
change makes marriage less necessary and easier to end. In this
paper, Maley looks at ways to give marriage greater legal support
without creating undue obstacles to divorce. He advocates introducing
fault into divorce settlements as a way to indirectly re-enforce
the institution. &quot;Fault&quot; in divorce proceedings is where
one party-for reasons such as violence, substance abuse or child
neglect-is at fault in the marriage and that this should therefore
be taken into account in a divorce settlement. Maley concludes
that this reform would create clear standards of marital conduct
and give incentives for standards to be observed. 32 pp. CONTACT:

<I>Discussion Paper</I> No. 3, Centre for Renewal in Public Policy<HR>

<P>
Cindy Silver, a lawyer in Vancouver, British Columbia, examines
family autonomy and the Canadian Charter of Rights. She observes
that a radical restructuring of the roles and relationships of
the family and state has developed. The state is taking an evermore
active role in protecting child rights as defined under the United
Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Silver discusses
the impact on the family of state attempts to both define and
protect &quot;the best interests of the child.&quot; She reviews
certain recent cases that deal with the state superseding parental
rights over a child, and calls for affirming the importance of
the family by, once again, giving explicit recognition within
the Canadian constitution. Finally, she lauds a recent Canadian
Supreme Court decision that renewed recognition of the family
and provided a much-needed balance to the administrative and judicial
polices of the state in cases involving the parent-child relationship.

<B>Settlement Reached on <BR>
Behalf of VCU Professors</B>
<P>
CIR represented six male professors who sued Virginia Commonwealth
University for sex discrimination arising from a 1992 &quot;women-only&quot;
pay raise. After the trial judge granted VCU summary judgment
on the basis of a regression analysis that purported to show a
pay imbalance between the sexes, the full Fourth Circuit Court
of Appeals reversed. The <I>en banc</I> court said that a question
existed as to whether the regression analysis actually established
a pay imbalance and remanded the case for trial.
<P>
The day before the September 23 trial date, the parties negotiated
a settlement. VCU promised not to adjust pay in the future without
considering merit, but demanded that the financial details of
the settlement remain confidential. The professors stated that
they were very satisfied with the terms of the settlement.
<P>
<B>CIR Represents Class Objecting <BR>
to Proposed Settlement</B>
<P>
In September, a class of non-black Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms (BATF) agents moved to intervene in <I>Stewart v.
Rubin</I>. The initial case was filed as a class action lawsuit
in 1990 on behalf of all African-American Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms agents. The plaintiffs charged the BATF's Office
of Criminal Enforcement with discrimination against African-American
agents in its hiring and promotion practices. The parties reached
a proposed settlement that received the preliminary approval of
District Court Judge Royce Lamberth on July 9, 1996.
<P>
Under the proposed settlement, the class of African-American agents
will receive a multi-million dollar cash settlement. Further,
African-American agents will be eligible for promotion pursuant
to an informal procedure that will be distinctly different from,
and far less rigorous, than that applicable to all other agents.
<P>
CIR, on behalf of non-black BATF agents, is challenging the race-conscience
relief provided for in the proposed settlement on the ground that
it is unconstitutional under the Fifth Amendment. Specifically,
there is  no evidence of present effects of past discrimination
and the remedy is not narrowly tailored to meet a compelling government
interest.

<B>Due Process Due Private Contractors</B>
<P>
The United States Supreme Court has been asked to hear a due process
case, in which the Department of Defense (DOD) arbitrarily canceled
a lucrative contract for default, without holding a hearing mandated
by federal law.
<P>
In <I>DCX v. William J. Perry, Secretary of Defense</I>, a defense
contractor was hired to manufacture lighting equipment for the
government, and had hired a subcontractor (the only subcontractor
with the necessary technology) to test the equipment. However,
the government intervened in the testing schedule and forced the
subcontractor to test other systems with a higher priority. The
delay resulted in DCX being in default on contract. DOD then abruptly
canceled the contract.
<P>
In taking that action, DOD did not follow its own regulations
requiring it to assess the circumstances and determine whether
the default was excusable. Under the government's own regulations,
the assessment must be made prior to terminating a contract. DCX
sued, alleging that by not applying the regulations, DOD violated
DCX's due process rights. Had a hearing been held, DCX would have
shown: 1) the government was responsible for the delay; 2) DCX
would still be able to meet the contract delivery date; and 3)
termination of the contract would bankrupt several small businesses
that subcontracted with DCX. The federal trial and appellate courts
held for the government, and DCX has now petitioned the Supreme
Court to review the case.
<P>
In its <I>amicus curiae</I>, Defenders urged the Court to review
the case on the ground that under the Due Process Clause of the
Fifth Amendment, government must act fairly when it deprives a
person of property, which in this case consists of contract rights.
<P>
<B>State Corners Market By Infringing Private Property Rights</B>
<P>
Defenders is co-counsel to Mr. Taylor who owns property surrounded
by the Cass Scenic Railroad in Pocahontas County, West Virginia.
Mr. Taylor decided to build a restaurant and souvenir shop to
service the hundreds of tourists to the Railroad. At present,
the only concession stand in the park is operated by the state.
Fearful of the competition from Mr. Taylor's proposed shop, the
state decided to simply block the only access to the property
across the state land. On the day construction was to begin, the
state locked the gate to the public access road, and has refused
to allow Mr. Taylor entry onto <I>his own property</I>. Since
then, the state has proceeded to take any action it desires on
the property without the consent of the owner, including removing
trees and altering its elevation.
<P>
Defenders plans to file a lawsuit in federal district court in
West Virginia, alleging the state: 1) unconstitutionally deprived
Mr. Taylor of his right to use and enjoy his private property
in violation of the United States and West Virginia constitutions;
2) tortuously interfered with Mr. Taylor's economic advantage
by preventing him from establishing his business; and 3) unlawfully
trespassed on private property.

<B>Report on School Choice Cases</B>
<P>
Ohio - The parties are briefing the case in the Court of Appeals.
The IJ brief is due on October 29th. Jeanne Allen of the Center
for Education Reform has agreed to coordinate an <I>amicus</I>
brief on behalf of pro-school choice groups. IJ expects oral argument
later this fall, and a decision most likely in the spring.
<P>
Milwaukee - IJ is briefing the non-religion state constitutional
issues in trial court, with a resolution expected later this fall.
 The court granted the NAACP's motion to consolidate its lawsuit,
which it filed in August, with the ongoing cases. The NAACP repeats
the same allegations, but adds a racial segregation claim. The
court will hold that issue until resolution of the current issues,
and we expect appeals to follow the next ruling rather than awaiting
resolution of the segregation claims.  The IJ's goal is to move
the litigation along swiftly, winning on as many issues as possible
at this level.  So far, the NAACP's efforts to derail the case
have not succeeded.
<P>
Vermont - As expected, the ACLU joined the lawsuit challenging
Chittenden's decision to pay tuition at religious schools. At
a status conference on October 1, the trial judge ordered the
state not to withhold education aid from Chittenden, and directed
Chittenden not to pay religious school tuition pending a ruling
on its merits. The court directed the parties to stipulate the
facts, and indicated it would expedite the case and render a decision
later this fall. That means the case should be in the Vermont
Supreme Court this winter, and possibly in the U.S. Supreme Court
as early as next year.

<B>NELF Enters Declaratory Jurisdiction Dispute</B>
<P>
NELF has entered a case which threatens to undercut the usefulness
of the federal declaratory judgment law. A declaratory judgment
is a method of obtaining judicial determination of rights and
wrongs before a matter has reached the stage of ordinary litigation.
Businesses often use this procedure to eliminate uncertainty.
<P>
The case involves a looming patent dispute between EMC Corporation
and Norand Company. Norand sent EMC a letter claiming EMC was
infringing its patents and suggesting EMC pay it millions in licensing
fees. Negotiations broke down and EMC filed suit in Boston seeking
a declaratory judgment that there was no infringement. A district
court judge found that the dispute was not sufficiently ripe to
confer jurisdiction. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit, which hears patent-related appeals, affirmed, but on
different grounds. It found jurisdiction but held that trial judges
have almost total discretion to decide whether to hear declaratory
actions, even when statutory jurisdiction is conceded.
<P>
NELF filed an <I>amicus</I> brief in its own name supporting rehearing
which argued that declaratory actions are a valuable way to remove
uncertainty. By giving judges broad discretion not to hear such
cases, the court undercut that process and may have introduced
subjectivity into the judicial process. Judges can now avoid types
of cases they do not want to hear and, may choose to hear cases
which interest them and for which they may have preconceived views.
This conflicts with the ideal of a neutral, objective judiciary.
While rehearing has been denied, NELF is supporting EMC in seeking
review by the U.S. Supreme Court.

On behalf of the Connecticut Business and Industry Association,
NELF has filed a brief in a test of whether that state's courts
will continue independent reviews of appeals from local tax authorities.
The case involves Hartford's taxation of copiers owned by Xerox
Company. The assessor used &quot;book&quot; value as the basis
for taxing the copiers, rejecting Xerox's evidence as to their
true market value, the statutory basis for local taxation. A Superior
Court judge affirmed the city's decision.
<P>
NELF's <I>amicus</I> brief to the Connecticut Supreme Court argued
that the judge erred by looking only to whether the assessor's
decision was &quot;reasonable.&quot; NELF argued that, because
of the inherent conflict between assessors' duties to apply the
law and to maximize tax revenues, courts can and must independently
determine all necessary issues including determinations of value.
Ceding that power to assessors could leave taxpayers vulnerable
to arbitrary and even malicious misassessments.
<P>
<B>NELF Defeats Effort to Tax Non-Profit <BR>
Legal Groups</B>
<P>
In a case with ramifications for all non-profit firms, NELF has
defeated the City of Boston's effort to levy taxes upon NELF's
Boston office. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled
that Boston violated state law when it denied NELF the tax exemption
statutorily allowed to all non-profit organizations.
<P>
The case began in 1991 when Boston reject NELF's first application
for exemption for its Boston office. Possibly referring to NELF's
successful challenge to a Boston ordinance, a city bureaucrat
sneered that the city would not &quot;feed the hand that bites
it.&quot; NELF appealed to the Appellate Tax Board and eventually
went to Superior Court. The city's position throughout was that
NELF was &quot;too political.&quot; While conceding that NELF
is non-partisan and completely avoids electoral politics and lobbying,
the city claimed NELF's work in the courts was an impermissible
effort to &quot;change the law.&quot; Eventually other property-owning
legal foundations headquartered in Boston were caught up in the
dispute when NELF's attorneys pointed out the hypocrisy of taxing
NELF while exempting groups with different missions.
<P>
The Court's decision resolves this matter. It stresses NELF's
essentially conservative role. Courts apply law, they do not make
it. By pursuing cases, NELF is not seeking to make new law; it
is trying to uphold the law as it already stands. The Court also
rejected Boston's claim that NELF serves too small a fraction
of the community to be entitled to exemption. It held that NELF's
legal work benefits the public as a whole and so NELF meets the
statutory test for a charitable organization.
<P>
By rebuffing Boston here, NELF not only protected its own interest
but also set a precedent that will limit future government attempts
to extract revenue from non-profits or to coerce them into tailoring
their missions to fit government's wishes.
<P>
<B>NELF Files Brief for Realtors in <BR>
Large Lot Zoning Case</B>
<P>
On behalf of the Greater Boston Real Estate Board, NELF filed
an <I>amicus</I> brief with Massachusetts' highest court, urging
adoption of guidelines on how to review local zoning rules which
impose large minimum lot sizes. The case comes from Martha's Vineyard
where the town of Edgartown bars new housing on lots smaller than
three acres, substantially reducing the supply of affordable new
housing and imposing significant limitations on landowners' rights
to use their property. NELF's brief argued that the court should
require lower courts to give special scrutiny to large lot zoning
because of its negative impact on migration into the town and
because of its devastating effect on owners of lots under minimum
size.

<B>WASHINGTON LEGAL FOUNDATION</B><HR>

<P>
<B>Texas IOLTA Program Derailed</B>
<P>
The Washington Legal Foundation scored a major victory when the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit unanimously ruled
on September 12, 1996 that Texas' Interest On Lawyer's Trust Accounts
(IOLTA) program is subject to First Amendment and Fifth Amendment
takings challenges. In <I>Washington Legal Foundation v. Texas
Equal Access to Justice Foundation</I>, the court of appeals took
bar authorities to task for arguing that the interest generated
on clients' funds that are pooled before the funds are disbursed
to them is not the property of the clients. Comparing this fund
raising scheme to alchemy, the court ruled that interest always
follow the principal regardless of the amount generated. IOLTA
programs generate approximately $150 million<B> </B>annually nationwide,
which is used to supplement Legal Services Corporation funding
for activist groups. Texas bar authorities, along the American
Bar Association and other groups, are expected to seek Supreme
Court review of this precedent-setting decision, which conflicts
with a First Circuit decision also litigated by WLF.
<P>
<B>Superfund Law Challenged</B>
<P>
WLF filed a brief with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh
Circuit in <I>U.S. v. Olin Corporation</I> seeking to uphold a
lower court decision that ruled that the 1980 Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), or Superfund
law, does not apply to discharges of hazardous wastes that occurred
before the law went into effect, and that if it did, the law as
applied would violate the Commerce Clause because there was no
showing how the inactive site affects interstate commerce. WLF's
clients in the case include U.S. Senators Bob Smith, Lauch Faircloth,
Larry Pressler, Alan Simpson and Representatives Michael Oxley,
Bob Livingston, Joe Barton, Sonny Callahan, Jack Fields, Jimmy
Hayes, John Hostettler, Enid Greene, and Bill Goodling.
<P>
<B>Junk Science Challenged in the Courtroom</B>
<P>
WLF filed a brief in the Supreme Court of Nevada in <I>Mahlum
v. Dow Chemical Co.</I>, arguing that Dow Chemical should not
be held liable for alleged injuries caused by silicone breast
implants made by Dow-Corning, a separate legal entity. WLF argues
that not only is there no credible evidence showing that the silicone
implants caused any harm, but that in any event, Dow Chemical,
which had nothing to do with the manufacturing or testing of the
silicone, should not be held liable because of a lack of legal
causation between the injuries and Dow Chemical. Rather, the plaintiff's
attorneys were simply trying to obtain money from Dow Chemical
because Dow Corning had filed for bankruptcy under the crush of
implant lawsuits.
<P>
<B>Sex Offender Law Defended</B>
<P>
WLF filed a brief in the U.S. Supreme Court in <I>Kansas v. Hendrick</I>
seeking to uphold state laws that impose preventive detention
on dangerous sex offenders after they complete their original
sentences. WLF filed its brief on behalf of Kansas state legislators,
asz well as Kansas's entire House of Representatives delegation
-U.S. Representatives Sam Brownback, Jan Meyers, Pat Roberts,
and Todd Tiahrt, as well as .

<P>
<B>Young America's Publishes Briefs on Social Security and Financial
Aid, and 3rd Edition of <I>The Myth of the Robber Barons</I></B>
<P>
The latest two issue briefs from the Young America's Foundation
provide information on the issues of social security privatization
and reform of the student financial aid system, two issues important
to college-aged students. These two briefs will provide information
that will allow conservative students to challenge liberal professors,
fellow classmates, and slanted editorials on the two subjects.
 
<P>
YAF has also published the 3rd Edition of <I>The Myth of the Robber
Barons,</I> by Burt Folsom, Visiting Fellow at the Mackinac Center.
First published in 1987, the book was widely praised and is now
assigned in scores of colleges and universities throughout the
United States. The book challenges the liberal interpretation
of the rise of big business that is found in many textbooks on
American history.

<B>Grove City College Rejects Department of Education Demands</B>
<P>
Grove City College in western Pennsylvania has announced that
it will end its participation in the Federal Stafford and Federal
PLUS loan programs at the end of the current academic year. The
college will replace the Stafford/PLUS loans for its students
with a privately financed loan program. Current regulations require
that Grove City sign a complex participation agreement that subjects
it to federal government oversight, and also to furnish audited
financial statements to the federal government. According to the
school this move reflects its long-standing principles of remaining
independent and free from government intrusion in the operation
of the College.
<P>
<B>Free Congress Foundation Video Tape: &quot;America the Bankrupt.&quot;</B>
<P>
The Free Congress Foundation has released a new video tape hosted
by the former Governor of Delaware, Pete DuPont, entitled &quot;American
the Bankrupt.&quot; The tape examines the &quot;true&quot; national
debt. The problems highlighted in the tape include: a national
debt that is spiraling out of control, a Medicare program that
will go bankrupt in 2001,  Social Security fraud, massive growth
in entitlement spending, a welfare system that doesn not work,
and soaring tax rates. The tape also features commentary by Senator
Larry Craig, Senator Don Nickles, Rep. Mark Neuman, OMB Director
Alice Rivlin, and several other economic experts. CONTACT: Free

<B>National Tax Limitation Foundation's State/Local Government
Fiscal <BR>
Restraint Project</B>
<P>
The National Tax Limitation Foundation (NTLF) has initaited a
project to review and analyze state and local government fiscal
restraint mechanisms. The maturation of the tax limitation movement
at state and local levels, and the devolution/block granting of
functions from Washington to the states convinced NTLF to undertake
this project. NTLF is seeking to create a systematic body of knowledge
that can illustrate what types and combinations of fiscal restraint
devices work best to control state/local government taxes and
spending. This will provide a unique, permanent body of data and
analysis that NTLF hopes will enable policy makers to shape state/local
government institutions in a more fiscally responsible fashion.
NTLF plans to work with key players in each state: state policy
councils, ALEC legislative leaders, tax research groups, fiscaly
conservative academics and taxpayer advocacy organizations and
activists.  CONTACT: National Tax Limitation Foundation, State/Local
Government Fiscal Restraint Project, c/o Barry Poulson, fax 303/492-8960,

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>Reviewing the Revolution: Conservative
Successes in the 104th Congress<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER><HR>
<P>
Buoyed by the dramatic outcome of the 1994 elections,
conservatives had high expectations for the incoming Congress.
For the first time in 40 years, conservatives assumed key leadership
roles in both chambers. Particularly encouraging were the members
of the incoming House freshman class, many of whom had based their
successful campaigns on the Contract With America and its bold
commitment to reforming Congress and reducing the size and scope
of government.
<P>
Considering President Clinton's many vetoes of major
legislation, conservatives have achieved amazing success in transforming
government and the way Congress does business. Despite setbacks
and retreats, the 104th Congress has fulfilled conservative's
hopes in several key areas by beginning a revolutionary reversal
of failed liberal policies in such areas as welfare, agriculture,
and regulation.
<P>
The successes of the 104th Congress are particularly
significant when measured against the records of previous Congresses.
While this Congress adopted significant government reforms with
only narrow majorities, the New Deal and Great Society Congresses
had large liberal majorities. Moreover, the legislation passed
by those lawmakers was championed and signed by liberal Presidents.
Although the revolution remains to be completed, conservatives
should appreciate the progress that has been made.
<P>
No assessment of the 104th Congress would be complete
without a recognition of what could have been accomplished if
the President had not vetoed critical legislation. The most important
accomplishment of this Congress was a balanced budget bill which
would have eliminated the deficit by the year 2002 while mandating
$245 billion in critical tax reductions. American families would
have benefited from a $500 per child tax credit.
<P>
This legislation not only represented the first balanced
budget in 26 years, but also contained significant reforms in
government programs which would have returned power to states
and communities. In spite of the President's opposition, Congress
succeeded in reducing discretionary spending for the first time
since 1969. As submitted, the President's FY 1996 budget would
have raised the deficit to $211 billion; Congress deserves the
taxpayers' appreciation for cutting the Administration's projected
deficit nearly in half.
<P>
Perhaps the most notable achievement of the 104th
Congress was its overhaul of the nation's welfare system. While
the President twice vetoed welfare reform bills, he indicated
that he would sign a third which differed from the first two bills
only in minor respects. This historic legislation ends the federal
entitlement to welfare, contains real work requirements and time
limits, and fights illegitimacy. President Clinton promised to
&quot;end welfare as we know it.&quot; But it was conservatives
in Congress who made this promise a reality.
<P>
In many other areas, Congress succeeded in adopting
conservative, commonsense alternatives to liberal approaches advanced
by the Clinton Administration and its allies on Capitol Hill.
Congress restored funding for important national security programs
that were slashed by the Administration and its allies in Congress.
Lawmakers deregulated telecommunications, stemmed the tide of
costly federal mandates, and gave the President the line-item
veto.
<P>
Conservatives in the last Congress stopped the Clinton
health care bill that would have led to socialized medicine; this
Congress passed a scaled-down version of health care reform that
had as its primary goal enhancing portability of health insurance.
However, Congress did not address the flawed tax treatment of
employment-based health insurance that produces costly distortions
in the health care market, undermines consumer choice, and restricts
access to health insurance.
<P>
Congress has more work to do to complete work on
other conservative objectives. Lawmakers failed to pass legislation
to end racial preferences. They were unable to end government
funding for left-wing political activities. They failed to close
down the Energy, Education, Commerce, or Housing Departments.
The National Endowment for the Arts and the Legal Services Corporation
live on. But Congress did achieve cuts in all of these programs
that were unthinkable before 1994.
<P>
It took 60 years to build the modern welfare state,
and it will take more than just two years to do what is needed
to reform it. The 104th Congress, has taken significant steps
to reduce the size of the federal government and to empower states,
local communities, and individuals. President Clinton has stated
that &quot;the era of big government is over.&quot; The 104th
Congress has actually done something to turn this rhetoric <BR>
into reality.<BR>

A Challenge to the U.S., <BR></a></B>by Richard Fisher
<P>
<I>Asian Studies Center Backgrounder</I>, No. 142, The Heritage
Foundation<HR>
<P>
China's moves to expand and modernize its air force poses the
first major challenge to the U.S. post-Cold War strategy in Asia.
With China's commitment to build a world class air force, Richard
Fisher, Senior Policy Analyst at the Heritage Foundation, argues
that the United States must proceed with programs to guarantee
American air superiority in Asia. According to Fisher, the U.S.
should: sustain funding for the F-22A jet fighter; maintain 12
Navy aircraft battle groups; develop an air-superiority fighter
for the Navy; accelerate development of a helmet-sighted missile
and make advance U.S. air-to-air missiles available to U.S. allies;
develop advanced versions of the F-16 and F-18 for allied and
friendly Asian air forces; and ask Russia and Israel to curtail
sales of advanced combat aircraft and related technology to China.

Ariel Cohen, Salvatori Fellow in Russian and Eurasian Studies
at the Heritage Foundation, scrutinizes the fall of the Soviet
Union on the grounds that it was an empire. Prior to the downfall
of the Eastern Block, Sovietologists held no consensus that the
USSR was an empire to begin with. This is one reason why the fall
was so surprising. In theory and writings on empires, however,
there was abundant evidence that the USSR was soon going to collapse.

Bruce Bueno de Mesquita, Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution,
and Jongryn Mo, Hoover National Fellow, predict that the North
Korean military and the leaders of heavy industry, will be the
powers who will control North Korea's destiny for the next few
years. The authors expect that North Korea will enter a period
of political instability and Kim Jong-Il will become little more
than a figurehead. The authors conclude that North Korea will
not likely improve its economy or stabilize its government in
the next few years. 19 pp. CONTACT: Hoover Institution Press,

<B>Antiproliferation of the 21st Century, <BR>
</B>by Kerry Herron
<P>
<I>Strategic Review</I>, Vol. XXIV, No. 3, United States Strategic
Institute<HR>

<P>
Kerry Herron, retired U.S. Air Force Colonel, and Associate Director
for Security Studies at the University of New Mexico Institute
for Public Policy, examines the issue of &quot;full spectrum antiproliferation&quot;
as a nuclear deterrent in the post-Cold War world. Full-spectrum
antiproliferation presents an alternative to nonproliferation
and systematic deterrence. Herron explains that full spectrum
antiproliferation integrates: 1) polices that are designed to
slow and limit the number of states with nuclear weapons; 2) procedures
intended to reduce the nuclear dangers among proliferates by promoting
nuclear deterrence, nuclear surety (safety, security, and use
control), and responsible management of nuclear materials while
reducing the risks of nuclear terrorism; and 3) reactive capabilities
and policies for reducing risks associated with nuclear crises
that are not deterred or otherwise prevented. Herron believes
that full-spectrum antiproliferation is the best way to deal with
the world's current situation with nuclear missiles. According
to Herron, this policy &quot;recognizes the value of both prevention
and deterrence in coping with the challenges of nuclear proliferation,
and provides for their integration into policy options consistent
with a comprehensive proliferation strategy.&quot; He concludes
that twentieth century prescriptions are inadequate for twenty-first
century problems.  10 pp. CONTACT: United States Strategic Institute,

<B>The Nuclear Black Market</B><BR>
<P>
<I>CSIS Task Force Report</I>, Center for Strategic and International
Studies<HR>

<P>
CSIS's <I>Global Organized Crime Project</I> (GOC) was established
to develop short- and long-term strategies to deal with the threats
to U.S. national security in the post-Cold War era posed by global
organized crime. This report, produced by the Nuclear Black Market
Task Force, one of seven groups that make up GOC, focuses on the
supply, illicit trafficking, and demand for nuclear weapons and
weapons usable uranium and plutonium, from the Former Soviet Union
(FSU). The task force presents a bleak picture of poorly protected
storage sites for Russia's more than 1,500 tons of weapons-grade
fissile material guarded by demoralized and underpaid guards.
This creates a situation where terrorist groups or corrupt security
personnel, and even rogue states could obtain the components needed
to build a nuclear device. The current situation is ripe for struggling
nuclear workers to be tempted to steal or sell materials. Partly
as a result of dismantlement, the current trafficking trends have
upward trends. The potential for an accident or use of smuggled
nuclear materials is likely to increase. On a brighter note the
Task Force reports that certain trends are favorable. For example,
improvements in the material protection, control, and accountability
programs in the FSU is progressing, albeit slowly. Also the number
of deployed warheads has been reduced, transit states are starting
to use technical detectors, and the international community beginning
to respond to the problem. The Task Force has developed policy
recommendations in policy, organization, technology, legislation,
and international instruments. They recommend that U.S. policy
makers do the following: apply performance measures' aim for sustainability;
implement cooperative programs for material destruction and removal
of weapons from the FSU; develop bilateral safeguards with Russia;
consider exchanges on science-based stockpile stewardship with
Russia; encourage and enhance opportunities for bilateral cooperation
of law enforcement on a case-by-case basis; robustly support intelligence
efforts; pursue and prosecute nuclear smugglers to the fullest
extent of the law; and declare common policies on nuclear black
marketing and extradition with like-minded governments. 50 pp.

<B>The Prophets of Doom: The Security Threat of Religious Cults,<BR>
</B>by Andrew Hubback
<P>
<I>Occasional Paper</I>, No. 67, Institute for European Defence
and Strategic Studies<HR>

<P>
Andrew Hubback, a freelance writer and a commentator on security
affairs, examines the potential terrorist threat of some religious
cults. A recent example of such violence was the nerve gas attack
on the Tokyo subway by the Japanese religious cult <I>Aum Shinrikyo</I>
(Search for the Supreme Truth). The <I>Aum Shinrikyo</I> attack
was only part of growing trend of violence by religious cults
directed at forces of authority within states and targeted at
the general public. Religious cult terrorism introduces a new
aspect to terrorist warfare-their violence is as inspired by religion
as much as politics. Even the most violent secular terrorist groups
have eschewed such cruel weapons as nerve gas because they believe
such an attack would be counter productive to their political
cause. As recent peace settlements in certain hotspots in Central
America, the Middle East and Southern Africa have shown, former
terrorist groups have some common interests with their enemies.
Some fanatical apocalyptic religious cults have no such rational
ends as peace with those they see as their enemies. Hubback briefly
surveys violent cults throughout history and illustrates the recent
increase in cult terrorism. He then goes into detail about several
groups including <I>Aum Shinrikyo</I>, The Christian Identity
movement and the Oklahoma City bombing, and other international
cults such as the Order of the Solar Temple. He concludes with
suggestions on how to counter religious cult terrorism. He says
the first and most important step that should be taken is to recognize
the threat in the first place and be on guard. According to Hubback,
the security services of democracies should devote the necessary
resources to collecting intelligence on &quot;subversive, anti-social
and potentially violent cults. The authorities must be prepared
for a pre-emptive strike not only to protect the general public,
but to protect innocent cult members as well.  44 pp. CONTACT:

<B>Developing a Consensus for the Future: A Report of CSIS U.S.
China Policy Task Force</B><BR>
<P>
Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies<HR>

<P>
In 1994 the Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies (CSIS)
established the U.S. China Policy Task Force, co-chaired by Senators
Max Baucus (MT), Frank Murkowski (AK), Chuck Robb (VA), and Representative
Jim Kolbe (AZ), Harold Brown, a CSIS counselor, and Lawrason Thomas
of the Amoco Corporation. The Task Force has addressed several
issues affecting U.S.-China relations including: U.S.-China economic
and commercial relations; political issues including human rights;
domestic developments in the PRC, Hong Kong, and Taiwan; regional
security; and cross-strait relations. U.S.-China relations have
developed to a point where disputes over individual issues pose
a threat to the overall relationship between the two nations and
prevent a consistent and coherent bilateral policy. This report
covers four elements that the Task Force believes U.S.-China policy
should revolve around; 1) developing a new consensus to reestablish
executive branch leadership and bipartisan congressional support
in regards to the priorities of U.S.-China relations; 2) a new
consensus that reflects &quot;value propositions&quot; to promote
U.S. interests and give direction to the overall relationship;
3) striving within U.S. politics and policy to accommodate both
pragmatism and idealism; and 4) the new consensus should hold
a firm U.S. position concerning cross-strait relations that acknowledges
that Chinese on the mainland, and in Taiwan, maintain that there
is only one China. The rest of this report covers the issues of
economic and commercial relations, political and human rights
issues, and bilateral and regional security relations, with specific
recommendations. 93 pp. CONTACT: The Center for Strategic and

<P>
Angela Antonelli, Deputy Director for Economic Policy Studies
at the Heritage Foundation, shows that the 104th Congress has
made several strides toward cutting regulatory red tape and began
to return common sense to regulation. However, she points out,
alarmists have been successful in convincing the American people
a reformed regulatory system would have disastrous consequences.
According to Antonelli, this Congress has a solid record of reforms
that will create a more flexible and less burdensome regulatory
system that will cost less and achieve the same or higher levels
of public health, safety, and environmental protection. 11 pp.

<B><a href="/heritage/library/categories/regulation/cbrief27.html">Why Congress Should Privatize Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac,</a></B>
<br>
by John Barry 
<P>
<I>Committee Brief</I> No. 27, The Heritage Foundation<HR>

<P>
John Barry, Policy Analyst at The Heritage Foundation, calls for
the privatization of the two largest housing-related government
sponsored enterprises (GSEs), Federal National Mortgage Association
(Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie
Mac). Ongoing hearings on the subject have brought forth the diverse
opinions of different federal agencies over whether federal sponsorship
of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is necessary or not. Barry points
out that Congress is now considering privatization while at the
same time defending its oversight role. Barry says that Congress
should keep in mind two important facts to guide its decision
concerning the two GSEs: 1) Congress is ultimately responsible
for safeguarding the interests of taxpayers-so congressional oversight
of these GSEs is necessary if they remain government sponsored
as and place the taxpayer at risk; 2) the original mission of
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, establishing an efficient secondary
mortgage market, has been fulfilled-so Congress should end their
sponsorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Barry includes other
reasons for breaking the links between Fannie Mae and Freddie
Mac, and the federal government: government intervention in the
mortgage credit markets is no longer necessary with the increased
availability of mortagages to all potential home buyers; the vast
size of the housing GSEs, due to federal guarantee, is a dangerous
presence in the capital markets; and the mixed private/public
nature of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac constitutes a conflict of
interest. 6 pp.  CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation,

</B>by Ken Weinstein and Thomas Wielgus
<P>
<I>Backgrounder</I>, No. 1087, The Heritage Foundation<HR>

<P>
In the 1988 case <I>Communications Workers of America v. Beck</I>,
the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that workers are entitled a refund
of the portion of their dues used for purposes other than collective
bargaining, contract administration, and grievance processes.
In 1992, President Bush issued an executive order requiring that
federal contractors post notices to inform workers of their Beck
rights. However, the Clinton Administration has rescinded this
order and has cooperated with union officials to keep workers
from knowing about these rights. The Worker Right to Know Act
is currently under consideration in Congress. The bill would require
unions to get permission from their members in order to use mandatory
dues for politicking or other activities outside of collective
bargaining. Weinstein and Wielgus argue that The Worker Right
to Know would enable union workers to exercise their rights freely.

<B>Competition in Electric Power: Strategies for Reform,</B>
<br>
by Doug Bandow
<P>
<I>Policy Report</I>, No. 14, John Locke Foundation<HR>

<P>
Doug Bandow, Senior Fellow at the Cato Institute, discusses deregulation
of the electric utility industries. Until the 1970s, it was assumed
that electric utilities were natural monopolies, and that electrical
service could not be provided through competitive markets. However,
examples of successful deregulation in the airline, banking, broadcasting,
energy, telephone and other utilities have made it less far fetched
to call for a similar deregulation of electric power. Steps toward
electric power deregulation have slowly been made since the disastrous
economy of the late 1970s shed light on the problems with electric
industry monopolies. In 1992 Congress mandated wholesale competition.
And by 1994 California and other states have even moved toward
retail competition. Bandow stresses the point that this process
of moving toward increased competition in the electricity industry
will not be without its difficulties. The complicated structure
of the system now as an enforced monopoly, with its state and
federal power subsidies, special regulatory impositions on utilities
for non-energy purposes, ownership restrictions of power companies,
and control of power grids, means that none of the issues can
be solved in isolation. Bandow calls for a federally planned and
enforced program to eliminate subsidies, contracts made under
the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) of 1978, non-energy
requirements, restrictions enforced under the Public Utility Holding
Company Act (PUCHA) of 1935, and control over access to transmission
grids while limiting stranded costs. This whole process will be
complicated politically and any change will generate opposition
from some interests. Bandow stresses that utilities deregulation
will be a significant factor in improving Americans' quality of
life in the early 21st Century. He concludes by saying that the
federal government, states, industry, consumer groups, and other
interests should work together to create a true market for electric
power that will provide Americans with better services at lower
costs. 62 pp.  CONTACT: The John Locke Foundation, P.O. Box 17822,

<B>Understanding Electricity Deregulation in Pittsburgh,</B>
<br>by Jake Haulk
<P>
Allegheny Institute<HR>

<P>
Jake Haulk, Research Director at the Allegheny Institute, discusses
how the deregulation of the nation's electric utilities holds
extremely large potential benefits in terms of lower prices and
higher quality of service for consumers. According to Haulk, regulation
as it is currently practiced is no longer appropriate for the
U.S. economy. &quot;Regulation encourages too much capital spending,
provides no inducement to cut costs and results in huge and wasteful
expenditures on litigation of prices and other regulated activities.&quot;
Steps have already been taken to ease the transition to deregulation.
For example, Haulk points out, federal agencies have mandated
that transmission grids of all competition at the wholesale level
will be open to all qualified generators. Retail deregulation
will soon follow this introduction of competition at the wholesale
level. Haulk also says that all customers will be able to choose
among a number of suppliers and have a choice of service levels
and price schedules in the new competitive system. Transmission
and distribution companies will be separately owned and probably
still regulated, but the generators and retail marketers will
be free to operate in a profit maximizing manner. He conservatively
estimates that a typical local residential customer in Allegheny
County will save about 30 percent, or $350 per year on electric
bills. 16 pp. CONTACT: Allegheny Institute for Public Policy,

<B>Promise and Peril: Implementing a Regulatory Budget,</B>
<br>
by Clyde Wayne Crews
<P>
<I>Regulatory Reform Project</I>, Competitive Enterprise Institute
<HR>

<P>
Clyde Wayne Crews, Fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute,
discusses the implementation of a Regulatory budget. He examines
the pluses and minuses of requiring Congress to set enforceable
limits on the amounts that federal agencies can force private
citizens to spend on federally mandated rules and regulations.
According to Crews, there currently exists a breach between rulemaking
and accountability. What he calls &quot;regulation without representation.&quot;
Congress loves to take credit for such legislation as the Clean
Air Act, but then blames the federal agencies, whose powers they
drastically increased with such legislation, for being &quot;out
of control.&quot; Meanwhile, the federal agency bureaucrats are
not accountable to voters. A regulatory budget would require Congress
to set and enforce cost caps on the regulations that the agencies
impose. Prioritizing what regulations bring the greatest benefits
and sensible protection would be a responsibility of Congress
and the agencies. Congress will become more accountable to the
voters for the costs and results of regulatory policy. Crews calls
for a few other steps to be taken to ensure that a budgeting effort
remains manageable and accountable. He calls for the establishment
of a regulatory cost freeze and the implementation of a &quot;Regulatory
Reduction Commission&quot; to address the existing $647 billion
regulatory enterprise; employing separate budgets for economic
and environmental/social regulation; and the controlling of hard-to-measure
indirect costs by abandoning the regulatory methods that most
often generate them. 28 pp. CONTACT: Competitive Enterprise Institute,

<B>How the Market Self-Polices Against Predatory Pricing,</B>
<br>

<P>
<I>Antitrust Reform Project</I>, Competitive Enterprise Institute
<HR>

<P>
Donald Boudreaux, Professor of Economics at Clemson University,
and Andrew Kleit, Professor of Economics at Louisiana State University,
argue that market forces are more effective than antitrust laws
in preventing monopolies from occurring. Kleit and Boudreaux argue
that economic research shows that predatory pricing is not likely
to result in a monopoly. Rival competitors have the incentive
and the ability to withstand a predatory price war. They maintain
that customers and suppliers of the predatory prices often have
the incentive and ability to thwart predatory efforts. Some elements
of antitrust law serve to thwart market forces of policing against
predation. Lawful 'private policing' strategies such as minimum
resale price maintenance, maximum resale price maintenance, and
price discrimination are rendered unlawful as a perverse consequence
of antitrust law. Antitrust prohibitions then increase the costs
of private firms of protecting themselves from monopoly. 20 pp.

<B>Candidates for Corrections Day: The Ten Worst Regulations of
the Federal Government,</B>
<br>
introduction by Robert Kasten
<P>
Institute for Policy Innovation, and Alexis de Tocqueville Institution
<HR>

<P>
In a joint publication, the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution,
and the Institute for Policy Innovation, present a list of the
top ten worst government regulations. In the introduction, Robert
Kasten, former Senator from Wisconsin, and Chairman of the Center
on Regulation and Economic Growth for the Alexis de Tocqueville
Institution, points out that government regulators frequently
far exceed the original intent of Congress when enforcing regulation.
Without &quot;sunset&quot; provisions, regulations stay in effect
even after they have become obsolete or outdated. To compile this
list, IPI and AdTI asked leading policy experts to write a brief
article on what they believed exemplified the worst regulations
from Washington. Kasten proposes that the regulations would be
perfect candidates for Congressional overhaul or elimination during
the next &quot;Corrections Day.&quot; Those ten regulations are:
the federal wetlands policy; the 60-40 rule; off-label drug use
regulations; the federal peanut program; the FDA's slow approval
process; Superfund; Environmental Tobacco Smoke; The Delaney Clause;
Discipline of special education students; and Toxic Release Inventory.

<B>The Impact of Enterprise Zones, <BR>
</B>by Terry Van Allen<HR>

<P>
Enterprise Zones are set aside low-income areas that have reduced
tax and regulatory barriers in order to stimulate economic development,
investment, and opportunity. Terry Van Allen, Director of Research
Initiatives at the University of Houston-Clear Lake, examines
the issue of how Enterprise Zones affect employment. He argues
that Enterprise Zones have a major impact on reducing unemployment.
His study also shows that vast majority of the new entry level
jobs go to the residents of the low-income zone, contrary to the
claims of critics. He also dispels the myth that most businesses
relocate to Enterprise Zones from other communities. Instead,
the evidence shows that most of the businesses in Enterprise Zones
have either been expanded or newly created from &quot;within&quot;
the designated communities. He also counters the argument that
the cost of providing tax incentives is too high. Van Allen argues
that poverty areas already have low tax revenues and high welfare
costs, so the benefits far outweigh the costs. The analytical
model that Van Allen has created projects that the designated
poverty areas on average can reach employment rate parity with
the surrounding more-prosperous communities within twelve years.
He recommends that the Clinton Administration and Congress increase
the number of Enterprise Zones and provide for capital gains tax
incentives within Enterprise Zones. 145 pp. CONTACT: Austin &amp;

<B>Is New York City Killing Entrepreneurship? </B><br>
by William Mellor
<P>
Institute for Justice<HR>

<P>
The Institute for Justice examines how New York City has made
it hard for self-employed entrepreneurs to pursue productive livelihoods.
New York's regulatory system is filled with entrepreneurs who
find that if they were to comply with the law, they would have
to abandon their way of making an honest living. The underground
economy in New York City now may represent as much as 20 percent
of the city's overall economy. This report looks at the government-created
barriers of licensing and permitting laws and public monopolies,
and their effect on entry-level entrepreneurship in New York.
They illustrate how obstacles to enterprise created by government
often times far exceed any legitimate exercise of government authority
to regulate in order to protect health and safety. IJ also focuses
on the tragedy, as well as the heroic efforts of those who try
to earn an honest living, despite the burden of senseless rules
and requirements whose main purpose seems to be to limit competition
in particular occupations. Finally, IJ makes recommendations for
how to create easier legal entry into entrepreneurial endeavors.

</B>by Bill Beach
<P>
<I>Backgrounder</I> No. 1091, The Heritage Foundation<HR>

<P>
As long as governments have been collecting taxes, the death of
well-to-do individuals has been a lucrative moment for tax collectors.
The manifestation of such a tax today is the estate tax. Except
the estate tax effects more than just the wealthy, with the hardest
hit being small business owners. Bill Beach, John M. Olin Senior
Fellow in Economics, puts forth the case for repealing the estate
tax, and identifies it as the &quot;worst tax of all.&quot; According
to Beach, the social and economic costs of the estate tax far
exceeds the revenue that it brings to the government. Growing
evidence shows that the estate tax: reduces economic growth, and
hurts the incomes of the people that wealth redistribution was
intended to aid; it increases the cost of capital, this slows
down research and development and the investment in machines that
would increase worker productivity instead-and thus wages; it
keeps the interest rates on home loans and other major purchases
unnecessarily high; and it does not raise very much money-and
may, in fact, cost government and taxpayers more in administrative
and compliance fees than it raises in revenue. Using two leading
econometric models, a Heritage Foundation study found that the
repeal of the estate tax would have a large and beneficial effect
on the economy. According to the analysis, if the tax were repealed
this year, over the next nine years: America's economy would average
as much as $11 billion per year in extra output; an average of
145,000 additional new jobs could be created; personal income
could rise by an average of $8 billion per year above current
projections; and the deficit would actually decline with the revenues
generated by extra growth. Beach points out that that estate tax
has few friends other than tax attorneys. 30 pp. CONTACT: Chris

</B> 
<br>
by Dan Mitchell
<P>
<I>Backgrounder</I> No. 1090, The Heritage Foundation<HR>

<P>
Dan Mitchell, McKenna Senior Fellow in Political Economy, explains
how dynamic scoring should be used to modernize the revenue-estimating
process. Dynamic scoring recognizes that tax policy effects the
economy, as opposed to static analysis, which assumes that tax
changes have no impact on economic growth. Mitchell argues that
dynamic scoring, if used properly, can help bring about sound
tax policy by reducing the politically unpleasant side-effects
of tax cuts. Static analysis does not take into account the fact
that a larger economy created by easing a tax burden brings in
larger revenue to government coffers. Politicians usually support
the idea of cutting taxes. However, they are afraid of being blamed
for the higher deficits that static analysis predicts will happen
with tax cuts. Mitchell lists several points that policy makers
should consider when taking steps to modernize the revenue-estimating
process: learn from history that static scoring overestimates
how much revenue will be generated by a tax increase, while underestimating
the revenue feedback that pro-growth tax changes will generate;
realize that dynamic analysis is not perfect, as opposed to static
analysis which is guaranteed to give the wrong answer; tax cuts
that have a greater effect on behavior, such as a capital gains
tax cut have a greater revenue feedback effect; policy makers
should insist that taxpayers get full disclosure on whatever model
and methodology is used by revenue estimators at the Joint Committee
on Taxation and the Treasury Department; have the goal of tax
policy be the maximization of growth, not tax revenue; and include
the estimated private and governmental compliance costs of taxation.
Mitchell concludes by saying that dynamic forecasting is based
on a proper understanding of how the economy works, and that history
has shown this approach to be more realistic. 17 pp. CONTACT:

This report from Cato presents an objective, comparative analysis
of the spending and tax policies of 46 state governors. Stephen
Moore, Director of Fiscal Policy Studies, and Dean Stansel, Fiscal
Policy Analyst at the Cato Institute, constructed a 14-variable
index of fiscal performance and applied it to the records of each
governor who took office before 1993. The authors then graded
each of the governors on their fiscal conservatism. George Pataki
of New York, Steve Merrill of New Hampshire, and Fife Symington
of Arizona, received the grade of &quot;A.&quot; Gaston Caperton
of West Virginia, Tom Carper of Delaware, Lawton Chiles of Florida,
and George Voinovich of Ohio received &quot;F's.&quot; A significant
trend that was uncovered by the study was that states have become
more fiscally conservative since 1994, and the new governors as
a class tend to be more fiscally conservative than those elected
before 1993. 84 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts

<B>Accounting for Growth: Incorporating Dynamic Analysis Into
Revenue Estimation, <BR>
</B>by Gary Robbins and Aldona Robbins
<P>
<I>Policy Report</I> No. 138, Institute for Policy Innovation
<HR>

<P>
Gary Robbins, John M. Olin Senior Research Fellow at the Institute
for Policy Innovation, and Aldona Robbins, Bradley Senior Research
Fellow at the Institute for Policy Innovation, examine the issue
of &quot;dynamic analysis.&quot; Dynamic economic analysis is
the process of estimating economic changes that occur because
of changes in tax policy. It does not assume that all economic
behavior and variables remain the same if tax laws or government
expenditures change. Robbins and Robbins used dynamic analysis
with three hypothetical changes: a per capita tax of $5,200; an
elimination of the capital gains and dividend taxes on individuals;
and a uniform rate for individual and corporate income taxes of
19 percent, all with a commonly accepted baseline of 2.5 percent
annual growth from 1996 to 2010. They found that the head tax
raises GDP 22 percent above baseline by 2010. By removing individual
capital gain/dividend taxes raises GDP 8.5 percent, and the 19
percent uniform rate puts real GDP 7.5 percent above baseline
by 2010. Their use of dynamic analysis suggests tax reform aimed
at growth can increase annual output roughly 10 to 15 percent.
This boost would lead to more jobs, higher incomes, and an expanded
tax base which would bring higher revenues, not losses. 19 pp.

This paper is the second in a series of reports on the property
tax system in the state of Washington. Each community varies in
its reliance on the property tax. The Washington Research Council
examines the property tax burden in fifteen diverse cities and
communities. The diversity of experience is lost in a statewide
aggregation. In the profiles of the fifteen cities, the Washington
Research Council presents valuation changes, looks at the property
tax collected by each of the major tax-levying jurisdictions,
identifies the degree to which each major local government relies
on property taxes as a share of its budget, and examines briefly

<B>The Hidden Heir: How Estate Taxes Are Swallowing up Family
Businesses And Farms-And How We Can Stop It</B>
<P>
Public Policy Institute of New York<HR>

<P>
The Public Policy Institute of New York examines the detrimental
effects of New York's state-level estate and gift taxes. With
federal estate taxes, and the additional burden of New York state's
top rates reaching 76 percent, owners of family businesses and
farms are often times forced to flee New York when they retire,
taking valuable assets with them. Most states do not add to federal
estate taxes, but simply take some of the tax that otherwise would
go to the federal government. New York collects the most revenue
of the states that do levy estate or inheritance taxes and has
the highest top rates on inheritance to children. Contrary to
the nationwide trend of states repealing their death taxes, New
York has been expanding its estate tax. This paper argues that
New York must reduce its rates, reduce the burden of the state
gift tax; conform estate tax credits to the federal level; and
make policy changes that can ease the transfer of family businesses
from one generation to the next. Finally, this paper argues that
New York could go further than a reduction in disadvantages, and
create an actual incentive for family businesses to locate in
New York state. By establishing a New York Sate Family Business
Fund, the fund could loan family businesses and farms money to
pay federal estate taxes. It would be capitalized with a small
share of exiting estate revenue flow-so that revenues from the
rich would pay for keeping family businesses and their jobs in
New York. 27 pp. CONTACT: The Public Policy Institute of New York

<B>Public-Private Promises #1: Three Rivers Stadium,</B><br>
by Grant Gulibon
<P>
<I>Report</I>, No. 96-14 Allegheny Institute<HR>

<P>
In light of the proposal to build a new government subsidized
baseball stadium in Pittsburgh, Grant Gulibon, Research Associate
at the Allegheny Institute, examines the rosy promises made in
a similar proposal approximately thirty-five years ago for Three
Rivers Stadium. Gulibon's report examines the claims used to justify
the construction of Three Rivers Stadium and contrasts them with
the stadium's actual performance since its opening. He found:
the original estimated cost of the stadium was $13.8 million,
while its final cost is estimated to be between $52 and $62 million;
the 83.5 acre site where the stadium was built was estimated to
cost $10 million in 1958, re-estimated to cost $21.72 in 1962,
but ultimately cost $45 million; Three Rivers Stadium was to be
a &quot;self-financing&quot; project which would not require city
or county operating support, but, has run up a $43 million deficit,
and has received operating subsidies for the Allegheny County
Regional Asset District; very little of the predicted private
development plans for the area surrounding the stadium exists
due to a lack of market demand; Through 1991 the city had over
$100 million on the stadium, still owes $40 million on the bonds
floated for the original construction, and had provided $27.1
million in subsidies for stadium operating deficits over the same
time period; deficits continued even after the stadium authority
hired a private management group to manage Three Rivers in 1982;
and St. Louis' Busch Stadium, four years older than Three Rivers
and nearly identical in size and design, privately financed and
has been privately owned and operated since it opened, was completed
under budget, has turned a profit each year since it opened, and
has been cited by baseball officials as one of the model facilities
in operation today. 19 pp. CONTACT: Allegheny Institute, 7 Parkway

<B>Restoring Opportunity to Arkansas: Changing a &quot;Tax and
Spend&quot; State to a &quot;Save and Invest&quot; State,</B>
<br>
by Stephen Moore and Dean Stansel
<P>
Arkansas Policy Foundation
<P>
Stephen Moore, Director of Fiscal Policy Studies at the Cato Institute,
and Dean Stansel, Fiscal Policy Analyst at Cato, discuss how changing
the tax policy in the state of Arkansas, would restore opportunity
to the state. In Arkansas, tax and spending has exploded over
the past fifteen years. Moore and Stansel list several examples
of Arkansas' heavy taxation: state spending is 50% higher than
it was in 1980-and spending has risen 12% faster than state income
in the same period; if the state budget had only grown at the
rate of personal income growth, Arkansas could both balance its
budget and give every family in the state a $1,000 tax rebate;
Arkansas' high tax burden is 15% above the national average, and
is weakening the state's competitiveness with other states; spending
priorities have been radically rewritten since 1980, from traditional
state responsibilities such as education, highways, and hospitals
to less productive and more redistributive goals such as welfare,
public health, and debt service; and that the state budget has
been growing at an annual rate more than twice that of inflation.
To solve these tax problems, Moore and Stansel offer the following
spending restraints and tax cuts: a 25% cut in personal income
tax rates, eventually to become a 5% flat tax to deliver economic
growth; indexation, which prevents state government from benefiting
through inflation; eliminate the state capital gains tax on new
investment, to have a giant impact on investment and job growth;
enact a one-year budget freeze to allow the rest of the state
to catch up; and finally, implement a constitutional budget cap
that prevents growth of spending from rising faster than the growth
rate of the state population plus inflation. Moore and Stansel
conclude that such measures have led to stunning economic success
in states as  different as Massachusetts, Michigan, and New Jersey.

<B>Taxation and Economic Performance, <BR>
</B>by W. Kurt Hauser
<P>
<I>Essay in Public Policy</I>, Hoover Institution<HR>

<P>
Kurt Hauser, President of a San Francisco investment management
firm, argues that increased tax rates do not raise the desired
additional revenues. In his essay he shows that the economy as
a whole tends to perform worse following a tax increase. Reduction
in tax rates, however, tends to make the economy perform more
favorably. Hauser notes that economists have debated for the past
two centuries over whether or not higher rates of taxation leads
to increased levels of government revenues. More recently, he
points out, the revenue generation forecast for the tax increase
of 1990 and 1993 fell short of the mark. According to Hauser,
higher tax rates tend to reduce the tax base because of the disincentives
that they cause to work, produce, save, or invest. There are also
incentives to hide, shelter, and underreport income when tax rates
are raised. Policy makers still continue to believe that increases
in marginal tax rates will raise revenues without the adverse
effects on economic growth, job creation, or standard of living.

<P>
This issue of <I>F.Y.I.</I> examines how free-market reforms concerning
health care have grown since the failure of the Clinton health
care proposals. According to ALEC, states are repealing the bad
reforms associated with Clinton Care, such as, community rating,
guaranteed issue, price controls, and managed competition. States
are now busy dealing with the massive managed-care systems and
protecting patient's rights. Instead of the centralized systems
of Clinton style reforms, states are moving toward market solutions
that allow choice to the patients and better overall care. !8
states have enacted laws allowing for medical savings accounts
(MSAs). Also in this issue, Dr. Merrill Mathews, Health Policy
Director at the National Center for Policy Analysis, discusses
solving the portability problem. He says that the problem should
be resolved without costing the federal government additional
money or distorting the health insurance market. States should
provide risk pools for uninsurable individuals. Kim Pacelli, ALEC
Research Assistant, briefly examines how states might reform Medicaid
programs if block grants are granted to states. More than 40 states
have already sought waivers from the federal government. 19 pp.

<B>Multicultural Mental Health: Does Your Skin Color Matter More
than Your Mind? <BR>
</B>by Sally Satel and Greg Forster
<P>
<I>Policy Brief</I>, Center for Equal Opportunity<HR>

<P>
Sally Satel, a psychiatrist and lecturer with the Yale University
School of Medicine, and Greg Forster, Policy Analyst at the Center
for Equal Opportunity, examine a new mental health field called
&quot;cultural competence&quot; or &quot;multicultural therapy.&quot;
According to Satel and Forster, this movement threatens to discredit
traditional therapy and replace it with identity politics. This
concept of therapy sees human behavior as primarily culture-dependent.
So according to the theory of this practice doctors and patients
will experience mistrust and miscommunication if they are of different
racial or ethnic groups. It also assumes that white therapists
are racist. San Francisco General Hospital has the most prominent
cultural competence program in the United States. The doctors
in the mental health unit there specialize in different patient
groups-blacks, Asians, Latinos, gays/lesbians/bisexuals, women,
and HIV-positive. The city of San Francisco has even created a
racial specialization for non-doctor health professionals: African
American Health Services Specialists. The authors argue that no
one believes that race and culture are irrelevant to mental health,
but that muticultural therapy seeks to establish rigid rules of
treatment based on stereotypes and groupthink. They conclude that
the patient is a human being, not a cultural puppet, and that
multicultural approach to psychotherapy spends more energy separating
patients into groups than treating them. 19 pp. CONTACT: Center

<B>Waiting Your Turn: Hospital Waiting Lists in Canada,</B>

<P>
Cynthia Ramsey, Health Economist at The Fraser Institute, and
Michael Walker, Executive Director of The Fraser Institute, present
the Institute's sixth attempt to examine and document the extent
to which waiting lists are being used as a way of adapting to
the conflict between limited budgetary allocations and the potentially
unlimited demand for free health care. This year's results show
that Canadians waited longer in 1995 than in 1994 to receive medical
treatment. They found that patients in 1995 waited longer-10.2
weeks from referral by a general practitioner to a specialist
until the receipt of treatment-compared to 9.7 weeks in 1994.
They also found that the number of people on surgical waiting
lists and the amount of time they are waiting for the treatment
varies from province to province. Patients in Prince Edward Island
wait almost two months longer for surgical procedures than people
in Quebec. Fraser's survey measured what specialists consider
to be clinically reasonable amounts of time to wait for surgical
procedures. In almost every instance, the responding specialist
thought that patients were waiting too long for treatment. Ramsey
and Walker conclude that a plausible explanation for the waiting
times is that governments are using them as a way to control health
care expenses by rationing access to health care.  58 pp. CONTACT:

<B>Repairing the Ladder: Toward a New Housing Policy Paradigm,
</B>
<br>by Howard Husock
<P>
<I>Policy Study</I>, No. 207, Reason Foundation<HR>

<P>
In this report, Howard Husock, Reason Foundation Adjunct Scholar,
examines the reasons why housing policy for the poor has not worked.
He lays out an overall plan and specific details for an new housing
policy paradigm that is based on ongoing, already successful initiatives.
He argues that the problems of public housing and related subsidy
programs is partly a result of a fundamental misunderstanding
of the role which housing plays in social and economic life. He
also argues that replacement policies that emphasized subsidized
rentals risk creating a new generation of problems and complications,
including the further undermining of the social structure of civil
society in poor neighborhoods. According to Husock, housing must
be seen as more than a physical good, and viewed as part of a
social system. or &quot;housing ladder.&quot; The housing ladder
concept relies on the notion that to best serve the most people,
the fullest range of privately owned housing types must be built.
The desire of the occupants of housing to move up the ladder from
one type to another, and the need to protect the value of one's
housing investment, plays a key role in maintaining the social
fabric of neighborhoods, especially very poor neighborhoods. Husock's
concept of the housing ladder comes from historical data that
indicates that private, owner-occupied housing has played a key
role in the lives of those of modest means. He uses examples of
private, public and nonprofit initiatives which have begun to
build or facilitate the construction of the housing that regulation
or deep subsidy programs have made difficult to build in recent
years, that can lead the way to a new housing paradigm. 66 pp.

Abraham Ellis, a New York City attorney, illustrates that Social
Security is just another entitlement program, not an insurance
system. He also shows that the Trust fund is an &quot;economic
house of cards.&quot; The payments are continuously being raised
regardless of a retiree's contributions. Meanwhile, the receipts
from the Social Security tax go into general government revenue.
Ellis points out, that in the event of a real economic crisis,
the government would have trouble meeting its obligations to elderly
Americans that depend on it. According to Ellis, Social Security
is unfair to prudent young people who could produce much more
for retirement by investing the amount that goes into social security
taxes. Overall, Ellis shows that Social Security is just another
way for getting additional taxes from the people. 208 pp.  CONTACT:

Security reforms such as raising the retirement age, raising payroll
taxes, or reducing benefits; and approximately two-thirds of voters
would support privatization of Social Security, and transforming
it into a privatized mandatory savings program. 7 pp. CONTACT:

<P>
Denis Doyle, Senior Fellow in Education at Heritage and author
of the study, reviews H.R. 3467, Saving Our Children:  The American
Community Renewal Act of 1996.  Title II of this provision would
implement an education choice scholarship program that includes
both private and religious schools in areas deemed to be &quot;renewal
communities.&quot; The proposed legislation would allow each locality
to determine the value of the special scholarships, with the maxiumum
value being no greater than the existing per-capita cost of education
in the local public school district. Doyle determines that this
legislation will enable poor children to enroll in better schools
and give their parents more choices concerning their education.

In an attempt to discover why intellectual standards have fallen
and students' knowledge has declined in basic areas of education,
the New York Association of Scholars and the Empire Foundation
for Policy Research commissioned this study of the campuses of
the State University of New York. They discovered a nationwide
trend in whereby students take an odd mixture of courses that
do not build on previous knowledge, while avoiding more fundamental
and serious subjects. For example, one campus mandates that students
take courses in physical education while at the same time does
not require courses in history, literature, philosophy, arts,
English composition, mathematics or science. In addition, intellectual
permissiveness and political correctness are running rampant on
these campuses with courses such as, &quot;Literature of Sports,&quot;Deviance,&quot;
&quot;Love and Sexuality,&quot; and &quot;Stage Combat.&quot;

<B>Charter Schools in Action: What Have We Learned?</B><br>
 by Chester Finn, Bruno Manno, and Louann Bierlein
<P>
Hudson Institute<HR>

<P>
Finn, Manno and Bierlein report their findings from the first
year of a two-year Hudson Institute study of U.S. charter schools.
The report focuses on the schools' start-up problems, solutions
to those problems, and the policy environments in which such schools
are most apt to thrive or falter. Start-up problems, not surprisingly,
include financial burdens and regulatory and political hurdles.
Among the many recommendations the writers make are setting up
charter schools to be legal entities in their own right, giving
charter schools the same per pupil operating funds that conventional
public schools receive, and using the charter model to develop
ways of holding all public schools accountable for their results.
Hudson suggests that charter schools may be the most vibrant force
in American education today and notes that the current demand
for charter schools far outweighs the supply. 127 pp.  CONTACT:

In the third annual report card on the progress of education reform
in the United States, the nation once again earned a grade of
&quot;C.&quot; The purpose of this report is to evaluate major
developments on several key refom fronts including course-taking,
achievement, standards, reinventing education, instruction, and
reinventing the federal role in education. Finn and Ravitch discover
rising enrollment figues in advanced math and science courses,
but disappointedly find that while more than three-fifths of high
school graduates now proceed directly to college, barely two-fifths
of them were in the academic track in high school. The study recommends
that schools continue to try to adhere to the strong academic
core that the National Commission on Excellence suggests. 66 pp.

<B>The New Paradigm on Environmental Enforcement: Environmental
Audit Privilege and Immunity Legislation,</B>
<br>by R. Kinnan Golemon and Laura Wolf
<P>
<I>The State Factor</I>, Vol. 22, No. 1, American Legislative
Exchange Council<HR>

<P>
R. Kinnan Golemon, a prominent expert in the field of Environmental
Law, and Laura Wolf, an environmental lawyer in Austin, present
a new paradigm for environmental enforcement. For the last twenty-five
years environmental regulation has focused on the &quot;command
and control&quot; model. Golemon and Wolf argue that this model,
which has developed an extremely complicated regulatory scheme,
is outdated and needs to change. They believe that a new environmental
regulatory model should focus on and encourage voluntary compliance.
Goleman and Wolf present &quot;audit privileges and penalty immunities&quot;
as part of the solution. These give an incentive for regulated
entities to conduct environmental audits without the fear of major
sanctions. The audits will promote candid, effective discussions
within the regulated entities to help find the causes of, and
the solution to, environmental noncompliance. They will also remove
the incentive to not identify or hide noncompliance so that the
problem can be solved in the most constructive possible way. 13

<B>Privatizing the Public Lands, <BR>
</B>by B. Delworth Gardner
<P>
<I>Focus on Utah</I>, No. 1, Sutherland Institute<HR>

<P>
B. Delworth Gardner, Professor Emeritus of Economics at Brigham
Young University, argues that the federal government should dispose
of its public land in the West, and permit private parties to
own and control the land itself. According to Gardner, private
management is superior to public management in conserving resources.
In economic markets, the future generations are represented by
entrepreneurs who will profit from, and are most interested in,
conserving resources for their future use. She continues by stressing
that consumers and taxpayers are the beneficiaries if market products,
in this case, land use user fees, are priced at competitive levels.
Although some public management products appear to be free or
subsidized, taxpayers must pay for such things as the lobbying,
campaign contributions, propaganda, and court costs that are incurred
in order to influence public decisions. Privatization and market
allocation at a price would make it so each consumer would pay
for what he gets. Resources would be more productive, and products
would increase in variety in order to be tailored toward consumer
tastes. If private entrepreneurs marketed hunting and fishing
privileges, they would manage the resources more efficiently and
more successfully. Private firms also have a greater incentive
to stop undesirable managerial behavior than government bureaucrats.
Finally, Gardner argues that the federal government should gradually
dispose of the public lands, and they should try alternative ways
for privatizing the public lands, such as long-term competitive
leasing of public lands to private groups. 17 pp. CONTACT: Sutherland

<P>
<I>Issue Analysis</I>, No. 36, Citizens for a Sound Economy<HR>

<P>
John Tottie, Senior Economist for Tax and Budget at Citizens for
a Sound Economy, examines the $47 billion in research and development
(R&amp;D) spending by the Department of Energy (DOE)-supposedly
for the benefit of taxpayers and the U.S. economy. In the early
days of the 104th Congress, DOE published &quot;Success Stories:
The Energy Mission in the Marketplace,&quot; highlighting what
the department thought were its successes in applied energy research
and development. The 22 page report seems like an attempt to fight
off the much needed reductions in the bloated spending by DOE
on R&amp;D. Tottie argues that the private industry that stands
to benefit from the R&amp;D spending, not taxpayers, should be
responsible for the costs associated with developing scientific
knowledge that has specific commercial applications.  8 pp. CONTACT:

Competitive Enterprise Institute<HR>

<P>
The Competitive Enterprise Institute commissioned <I>The Polling
Company</I> to perform a nationwide poll of 1,000 registered voters
nationwide. They found that most Americans support environmental
protection, but are not activists. They also found that most Americans
support a greater role for state and local governments in environmental
policy, and that state and local governments are better suited
at addressing environmental concerns than the federal government.
According to the survey, most Americans see devolution, regulatory
reform, and property rights as being consistent with environmental
protection. Also, Americans see nothing anti-environment about
alternative approaches to environmental policy. CEI argues that
the challenge for supporters of environmental regulatory reform
is to articulate a vision for the future of environmental policy
that combines the public's concern for environmental protection
with their preference for limited government policies. Americans
have come to realize that extensive federal bureaucracies are
not necessary to advance environmental protection, and that pursuing
environmental reform is not &quot;anti-environment.&quot; 25 pp.

<B>A New Environmental Tool? Assessing Life Cycle Assessment,
</B> 
<br>
by Mark Duda and Jane Shaw
<P>
<I>Contemporary Issues Series</I>, No. 81, Center for the Study
of American Business<HR>

<P>
&quot;Life cycle assessment&quot; (LCA) is a process that attempts
to measure the total environmental impact of a product and its
manufacturing process. Mark Duda, Fellow at the Political Economy
Research Center (PERC), and Jane Shaw, a Senior Associate of PERC,
discuss the reasons why this procedure should not be used to shape
public policy. According to Duda and Shaw, LCA is useful to companies
that want to know whether the raw material they use might become
scarce or become environmentally harmful. When companies use LCA
their data is generally reliable and their goals are usually clear.
If such procedures were used for public policy and regulatory
purposes, argue Duda and Shaw, it would require that practitioners
use data from a wide range of sources and then translate this
data into environmental impacts. The averages and aggregates produced
would be inaccurate and would not describe the differences between
one product and another. According to Duda and Shaw, it is hard
to translate resource consumption and emissions data into actual
environmental impacts. For example it does not take into consideration
the environment in which production occurs. Overall, they conclude,
LCA makes sense for individual firms, which use it to plan how
they will respond to environmental regulations and to the environmental
concerns of their customers. If LCA information is collected at
the industry level it is not sufficiently accurate for making
broad public policy decisions.  20 pp. CONTACT: Center for the

<B>A Turf Fight for Indoor Air Quality Protection, <BR>
</B>by Dwight Lee
<P>
<I>Contemporary Issues Series</I>, No. 79, Center for the Study
of American Business<HR>

<P>
Dwight Lee, an Adjunct Fellow for the Center for the Study of
American Business, discusses the bureaucratic turf war over the
control and regulation of indoor air. The Occupational Safety
and Health Administration (OSHA) has jurisdiction over workplace
safety and is in a fight with the Environmental Protection Agency
over jurisdiction of indoor air quality (IAQ) in the workplace.
The agency that is able to gain control over IAQ will be in a
good position to expand its budget and power. According to Lee,
EPA and OSHA are using the political issue of tobacco smoke to
muscle for their larger budgets. OSHA has made a proposal to ban
smoking in all work sites under its jurisdiction. According to
Lee, OSHA's position relies on flawed and biased studies that
emphasize that indoor pollution can be addressed by singling out
particular pollutants such as tobacco smoke. In reality, indoor
air pollution is a general problem that cannot be effectively
dealt with by singling out particular pollutants. Lee argues that
OSHA ignores cost saving alternative approaches, ignores the advantages
of market incentives and exaggerates the benefits of regulation.
Overall, it exploits the politically contentious issue of tobacco
to grab for more power. Lee concludes that the only argument that
can be made for OSHA IAQ regulation is that it would be no more
inefficient than EPA regulation.  16 pp. CONTACT: Center for the

Bruce Yandle, an Adjunct Fellow at The Progress &amp; Freedom
Foundation, Andy Barnett, Associate Professor of Economics at
Auburn University, and Mark Brandly, a doctoral candidate in economics
at Auburn, call for the creation of Environmental Innovation Areas
(EIAs). EIAs will recognize that different regions face different
environmental and pollution problems. Different regions should
be given flexibility to meet clean air requirements in ways that
are best suited for their particular area, instead of the top-down
command and control system that we currently have. Yandle, Barnett
and Brandly call for an end to federal fuel taxes that discriminate
against alternative fuels. With EIAs, states and regions could
design fuel taxes that encourage the appropriate use of cleaner
burning fuels for their area. Changing the laws that discriminate
against alternative fuel vehicles will be a lower cost way to
improve automobile efficiency and a reduction in American reliance
on imported petroleum than Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE)
standards. 57 pp. CONTACT: Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation,

The editors of this collection of essays, Terry Anderson, Executive
Director of PERC (the Political Economy Research Center), and

1990s will be remembered in history as the era of privatization.
The trend of privatization, which was in part, inspired by the
collapse of the former Soviet Union, is being hotly debated throughout
American government. This book is a collection of original essays
by distinguished scholars that examine the potential benefits,
as well as the possible pitfalls, of national and global privatization.
This book also provides several perspective on how privatization
can best be achieved. With the support of empirical evidence,
the various authors asses the institutional changes and economic
impact of this worldwide trend. 270 pp. CONTACT: Rowman &amp;

by Bob Moffit and Ed Meese
<P>
<I>Backgrounder</I> No. 1089, The Heritage Foundation<HR>

<P>
Bob Moffit, Deputy Director of Domestic Policy Studies at The
Heritage Foundation, and Ed Meese, former Attorney General of
The United States and Ronald Reagan Distinguished Fellow at The
Heritage Foundation, present twenty-one steps that public officials
can take to support their local police. Moffit and Meese draw
upon the success of former New York City Commissioner of Police
William Bratton's short tenure, in which serious crime dropped
36 percent, including a 44 percent drop in auto theft and a 45
percent drop in murder. A reduction in crime does not depend upon
new cars or computers, more officers and bigger budgets. What
is most important, this paper says, is solid personnel management
and a clear mission for combating crime and disorder, with support
from the public, the state and the courts, and the press. Moffit
and Meese give the following suggestions for specific ways that
local officials can strengthen their police forces through their
own efforts: police should have a more back to basics role; police
should combat minor &quot;disorder&quot; crimes that provide an
environment for more serious crimes; raise the standards for who
can become a police officer; improve police compensation; target
hot spots; and reduce caseloads for detectives, among other suggestions.
Moffit and Meese call on the federal government to: block the
appointment of federal judges who demonstrate an insensitivity
to public safety; review federal statutes dealing with crime,
and repeal the ones that impinge on the legitimate authority of
local and state law enforcement officials; review the impact of
the <I>Miranda</I> ruling; and pursue ways through enterprise
zones to revitalize inner-city neighborhoods among other suggestions.
Overall, states and localities need maximum flexibility to combat
violent crime. 37 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage

<P>
Ken Weinstein, Director of the Government Reform Project at the

a string of federal grants have continued to subsidize the Laborers'
International Union of North America (LIUNA) even as government
investigators were uncovering evidence of organized criminal influence
in the union. Weinstein argues that restrictions or elimination
of grants to politically active groups such as unions should be
seriously considered by Congress. Meanwhile, Congress should act
immediately to: require that relevant grantmakers at certain federal
bureaus testify about their knowledge of allegations of criminal
infiltration of LIUNA; prohibit organizations whose officers have
records of criminal wrongdoing from receiving federal grants;
renew efforts to restrict lobbying by federal grantees; and order
a General Accounting Office investigation into LIUNA's handling
of federal grants. Weinstein concludes by pointing out that it
is bad enough that mandatory dues from union members are used
to pay for corruption and political activities, tax payers should
not have to pay as well. 9 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The

<B>Civil Right and Sexual Behavior: An Analysis of the Employment
Non-Discrimination Act, <BR>
</B>by Paul Mero
<P>
<I>Insight</I>, Family Research Council<HR>

<P>
Paul Mero, a political consultant and congressional staffer, examines
how the Employment Non-Discrimination Act might lead to the adoption
of the entire homosexual rights agenda. He argues that organized
homosexuality, the political pragmatic side of the homosexuality
movement, has narrowly worded this bill as a calculated risk that
the final determination of this legislation will rest on some
very fundamental notions about homosexuality <I>per se</I>, and
whether or not mainstream America will accept these notions. According
to Mero, the narrowly worded language of the legislation is very
ambiguous and includes the curious term &quot;bisexual.&quot;
Mero says this term is one of the calculated risks with which
organized homosexuality is testing mainstream America. &quot;Bisexual,&quot;
is a person that has sex with both men and women. Unlike the word
&quot;lesbianism&quot; or &quot;homosexuality,&quot; which some
of the public can accept as possibly genetic traits, bisexuality
cannot be taken seriously, according to Mero. He argues that amending
the 1964 Civil Rights Act with the word &quot;bisexual&quot; would
be the same as society granting its crowning approval of promiscuous
sexual activity and to renounce marriage and traditional mores.
It would be no different than implying that promiscuity is a genetic
trait. Or it seriously confuses behavior with orientation. Mero
concludes by showing how organized homosexuality has exploited
the Hate Crimes Bill to further their agenda. They did it claiming
victimhood, confusing homosexuality with innate human properties
such as skin color, using bogus studies to support quantitative
claims of discrimination, winning the endorsement of former &quot;conservative&quot;
Republicans, and taking the media along for the ride with their
disregard for facts. Many of the same components exist for the
Employment Non-Discrimination Act. 17 pp. CONTACT: Family Research

<B>Feminist Jurisprudence: Equal Rights or Neo-Paternalism?</B>
<br>by Michael Weiss and Cathy Young
<P>
<I>Policy Analysis</I> No. 256, Cato Institute<HR>

<P>
Cato Associate Policy Analyst, Cathy Young, and University of
Houston Law Professor, Michael Weiss, argue that the rise of feminist
jurisprudence has gone far beyond the original and widely supported
goal of equal treatment for both sexes. According to Young and
Weiss, the new feminist legal theory agenda is to redistribute
power from the &quot;dominant class&quot; (men) to the &quot;subordinate
class&quot; (women), while such key concepts of Western jurisprudence
as judicial neutrality and individual rights are declared to be
patriarchal fictions designed to protect male privilege. Some
feminist-initiated legal reforms have addressed real wrongs such
as the inadequate protection for victims of domestic violence.
However, say Young and Weiss, feminist legal theory has resulted
in increasingly loose and subjective definitions of harassment
and rape, dangerous moves to eviscerate the presumption of innocence
in sexual assault cases, and a broad concept of self-defense in
cases of battered wives. The authors conclude that Courts and
legislatures should not limit individual rights and reaffirm the
fundamental principle of the classical liberal origins of the
movement for women's rights: equality before the law regardless
of gender. 63 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts

The Heritage Foundation<HR>

<P>
The Heritage Foundation has examined what successes the 104th
Congress has had in achieving conservative goals. Despite setbacks,
bad public relations and Presidential vetoes, the 104th Congress
has been successful in meeting conservative's high expectations
in several key areas. Overall they began a revolutionary reversal
of failed liberal policies in such areas as welfare, agriculture,
and regulation. Significant steps have been taken to reduce the
size of the federal government and to empower states, local communites,
and individuals. 72 pp.  CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage

by Christine Olson and Robert Rector
<P>
<I>Issue Bulletin</I>, No. 228, The Heritage Foundation<HR>

<P>
According to Christine Olson, Policy Analyst at The Heritage Foundation,
and Robert Rector, Senior Policy Analyst at The Heritage Foundation,
The American Community Renewal Act of 1996 (H.R. 3467) will promote
the moral renewal and economic revitalization of America's most
poverty-stricken urban and rural areas. The bill is sponsored
by Representatives J.C. Watts (OK) and James Talent (MO). It will
use tax incentives, regulatory relief, innovative school reform
pilot projects and homeownership incentives for areas of high
rates of poverty, crime, welfare dependency, joblessness, and
poor schools. Olson and Rector argue that the bill will achieve:
increased job creation; small business expansion and formation;
moral renewal; expanded educational opportunities; greater private
philanthropy to aid the poor; and greater participation by religious
organizations in providing services to the poor. This bill gives
Congress and the Administration an opportunity to change the way
the federal government has been involved in community development
over the last 30 years. The bill realizes that what our nation's
poorest communities need more than larger benefits checks from
the government is economic conditions that enable depressed communities
to become more profitable places for work and businesses. Olson
and Rector conclude that this bill represents an excellent opportunity
to make a bipartisan stand for children by tackling the root causes
of poverty, crime, and illegitimacy. 18 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain,

<br>by Pat Fagan and Wade Horn
<P>
<I>Issue Bulletin</I>, No. 227, The Heritage Foundation<HR>

<P>
Pat Fagan, William H. G. FitzGerald Fellow in Family and Cultural
Studies at The Heritage Foundation, and Wade Horn, Director of
The National Fatherhood Initiative, illustrate how Congress can
protect the rights of parents to raise their children. They argue
that the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act, introduced
by Senator Charles Grassley (IA) and Representative Steve Largent
(OK), will give parents superior standing over government and
its agencies in their children's education and in the protection
and formation of their children's moral character. Fagan and Horn
point out that the bill will declare that parents' rights to direct
the upbringing of their children are fundamental rights which
government can curtail only under conditions of &quot;compelling
interest&quot; and under &quot;strict guidelines&quot; of judicial
procedure, legal terms which guide courts in their decisions.
Overall, they say, the rights of parents as a group are disregarded
or endangered in too many cases by government officials. According
to Fagan and Horn, because of the persistent danger to the fundamental
rights of parents from state court rulings, professional associations,
government bureaucracies, the educational establishment, and international
agencies and bodies, parental rights need codification into law.

on Drugs,</a></B>
<br>
by John Walters and James O'Gara
<P>
<I>Backgrounder Update</I>, No. 270, The Heritage Foundation<HR>

<P>
John Walters, President of the New Citizenship Project, and James
O'Gara, Director of Research for the New Citizenship Project,
call for President Clinton to exercise leadership in the war on
drugs. They report that he has a poor record in this area. Interdiction
efforts and prosecution for illegal drugs are down, illegal drug
usage and emergency room admissions are up. Walters and O'Gara
argue that part of the problem has been not appointing effective
leaders in key positions to articulate and enforce a strong antidrug
message, and inappropriate reductions in staff at agencies dedicated
to fighting drugs on the front lines. They call on Congress to
focus federal efforts on law enforcement and programs that work,
and fund only those rehabilitation programs that have a track
record of success. One way to do this is to allow funding for
drug counseling and rehabilitation programs provided by religious
organizations. Walters and O'Gara conclude that American taxpayers
deserve presidential leadership on this issue, and the complexity
of the issue is not an excuse for ineffective policy and lack
of serious effort. 15 pp.  CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage

<B>Culture Wars in America,</B><br>
by Edward Lazear
<P>
<I>Essays in Public Policy</I>, Hoover Institution<HR>

<P>
Edward Lazear, Hoover Senior Fellow, discusses how the culture
wars in America threaten our ability to absorb new immigrants,
and to benefit from the diversity already present in the United
States. He argues that much of the conflict of the culture wars
in America is generated by government policies that reduce the
incentives to become assimilated and emphasize the differences
in the population. Some examples that Lazear lists are: education
in one's native language; unbalanced immigration policies that
result in large and stable ghettos, welfare availability; and
encouragement of a multilingual society by allowing citizens to
vote in languages other than English. Lazear explores patterns
of cultural assimilation and makes recommendations on policy related
to immigration, education, and language that may lead to an end
of the culture wars. 32 pp. CONTACT: Hoover Institution Press,

<B>Federal Drug War Ignoring Great Ally: Faith-Based Treatment,
</B><br>
by Robert Maginnis
<P>
<I>Insight</I>, Family Research Council<HR>

<P>
Robert Maginnis, Senior Policy Analyst at the Family Research
Council, illustrates how the government is actively discouraging
some of the most effective programs from drug treatment. Faith-based
drug treatment programs have consistently produced the highest
&quot;cure&quot; rates in the country for treating drug abusers.
State and federal agencies have tried to shut down several faith
based drug treatment centers because their practitioners did not
have proper medical qualifications This is despite the fact that
faith-based treatment has had much higher success rates at a fraction
of the cost of government endorsed centers. Maginnis says that
there are two differing schools of thought on the root causes
of drug addiction. Government agencies mostly believe that it
is a disease and should be treated as such. Faith based treatment
sees addiction as beginning with a moral problem and that treatment
requires an acceptance of moral absolutes. Maginnis says that
as far as drug treatment goes, one size does not fit all. Therefore
a diversity of treatment alternatives, including low cost taxpayer-free
and faith based programs must be available. The government should
not try to fight the drug war alone when the local faith community
can play a vital role in prevention and treatment. 12 pp. CONTACT:

<B>The Economic Way of Looking at Behavior: The Nobel Lecture,</B><br>

<I>Essays in Public Policy</I>, Hoover Institution<HR>

<P>Gary Becker, Nobel laureate in economics and Hoover Senior Fellow,
was recognized by the Royal Swedish Academy for applying and extending
the use of microeconomic analysis to human behavior. This essay
is the transcript of his lecture given at the 1992 Nobel Prize
award ceremony. Becker discusses four topics: discrimination against
minorities; crime and punishment; the development and accumulation
of human capital; and the structure of families. These issues
illustrate his economic analysis of social issues. 32 pp. CONTACT:

<B>Violence Against Women Act Declared Unconstitutional</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>CIR won a victory on July 26, 1996, when U.S. District
Judge Jackson L. Diser ruled that the Violence Against Women Act
(&quot;VAWA&quot;), was an impermissible exercise of Congressional
authority under the Commerce Clause and the Enforcement Clause
of the Fourteenth Amendment. In<I> Brzonkala v. Virginia Polytechnic
and State University</I>, CIR represents Antonio Morrison, a Virginia
Tech football player, who was sued, along with two teammates and
the University itself, by a female who formerly attended the school.
The July 26th Order granted CIR's Motion to Dismiss the case based
on VAWA's unconstitutionality.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>At issue in the <I>Brzonkala</I> litigation was the
section of VAWA providing a federal tort remedy for crimes of
violence motivated by an animus toward the victim's gender. Although
the Department of Justice and the National Organization for Women
argued that VAWA was constitutional because of (i) the enormous
impact gender-based crimes have on the national economy and interstate
commerce and (ii) Congress's power to enforce the Equal Protection
Clause, the court disagreed. Judge Kiser ruled that the Supreme
Court's recent decision in <I>Lopez v. United States</I>, striking
down the Gun-Free School Zones Act as beyond Congress's Commerce
Clause power, undermined the arguments of DOJ and NOW. Finding
extensive similarities and few distinctions between the School
Zones Act and VAWA, Judge Kiser held that the latter was also
unconstitutional.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>As for the Enforcement Clause claim,  Judge Kiser
points out, VAWA attempts to compensate women who are victims
of violent acts because of their gender, not because of the states'
denial of their Equal Protection.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>CIR to Represent School Board in Supreme Court</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>CIR, along with Michael Carvin of Shaw, Pittman,
Potts and Trowbridge, represents the Bossier Parish School Board
in <I>Reno v. Bossier Parish School Board</I>, a Voting Rights
Act case which should be argued during the Supreme Court's fall
1996 term. This is expected to test a question left unanswered
by the Court in its major Voting Rights decisions of last term:
whether a local government may be forced to create racially gerrymandered
districts.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Bossier Parish is a rural district of northern Louisiana,
with a minority population of about twenty percent. Because of
the highly scattered nature of the minority population, every
voting subdivision in the parish currently has a white majority.
This has not prevented African-Americans from winning local elective
offices in the past.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In 1993, the Bossier Parish School Board unanimously
accepted a new voting map with twelve districts, all of which
had white majorities. The district lines were based upon nonracial
considerations; an identical plan had already been approved for
use in other elections. Nonetheless, the Justice Department refused
to dilute minority voting strength. This refusal was based in
part on the development by the NAACP of an alternate map, which
would include two oddly-shaped (but majority-minority) districts.
The Justice Department has taken the position that the Voting
Rights Act requires a system of race-based proportional representation,
or, alternately, that the failure to embrace a gerrymandered map
is proof of racist intent.<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>Professor Sues Bowling Green State University
for Sex and Race Discrimination</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In <I>Hartman v. Trustees of Bowling Green State
University</I>, CIR is representing Dr. John Hartman, a white
male professor, who has sued Bowling Green and the Accrediting
Council on Education in Journalism and Mass Communications for
discrimination against him based on his race and sex. The Complaint
was filed July 1, 1996 in Federal District Court in Ohio.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In 1994, in response to an advertisement, Dr. Hartman,
a tenured professor of Mass Communications at Central Michigan
University, applied for a faculty position that would involve
teaching a class on diversity in media at Bowling Green. Despite
Dr. Hartman's excellent credentials, Bowling Green hired a less
experienced black female without a Ph.D. This hiring decision
came on the heels of the Accrediting Council's withdrawal of full
accreditation from the Bowling Green School of Journalism because
the percentages of women and minorities on its faculty were less
than those in the general population.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Ohio Civil Rights Commission previously concluded
that there was probable cause to believe that Bowling Green discriminated
against Dr. Hartman in this matter.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Columbia Union College Sues Maryland Officials
for Religious Discrimination</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In June CIR, along with Co-Counsel R. Hewitt Pate,
Sarah C. Johnson and Mark B. Bierbower of Hunton &amp; Williams,
filed a complaint on behalf of Columbia Union College in Federal
District Court in Maryland. The Complaint alleges First and Fourteenth
Amendment violations, and violations of the Religious Freedom
Restoration Act.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Columbia Union is a private college affiliated with
the Seventh-day Adventist Church that applied for funds from the
State of Maryland through the Father Sellinger Program. The Maryland
Higher Education Commission denied the fund request stating that
Columbia Union was &quot;pervasively sectarian.&quot; The Commission
has granted funds to Catholic schools such as Mount St. Mary's
and Loyola University, schools which, although &quot;sectarian,&quot;
are apparently not pervasively so. Columbia Union met all the
other requirements necessary to participate in the program and
asserts that the denial of funding by the Commission constitutes
discrimination on the basis of its religious beliefs and speech.

<B><FONT SIZE=2>CIR wins reversal in Fourth Circuit in <BR>
<I><B>Smith v. VCU</B></I></FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In <I>Smith, et al v. Virginia Commonwealth University</I>,
CIR is representing five male professors at VCU who claimed sex
discrimination when the school gave an en masse raise to female
professors in 1992. On May 10, 1996 an <I>en banc</I> panel of
the Fourth Circuit issued a decision reversing a district court's
grant of summary judgment for the University. The opinion of the
court obtained the support of six judges with three judges concurring
and five dissenting.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The <I>en banc</I> decision rejected VCU's attempt
to justify the raises with a regression analysis showing pay disparity
between the genders. The court said that there was an issue of
material fact whether some of the factors excluded from VCU's
study-like performance, productivity and merit-skewed the results
and permitted a false finding of &quot;gender disparity.&quot;

<B><FONT SIZE=4>DEFENDERS OF PROPERTY RIGHTS</FONT></B>
<HR>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>High Court to Decide Who Can Sue Under ESA</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments on November
13, 1996 in <I>Bennett v. Spears</I>, to determine whether a property
owner may assert an injury to an economic interest or constitutionally
protected property right under the citizens suit provision of
the Endangered Species Act (ESA).<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Petitioners are two individual ranchers and two irrigation
districts in southern Oregon who rely on water from a series of
federally-operated reservoirs known as the Klamath Project. The
U.S. Bureau of Reclamation and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
determined that a minimum level of water needed to be maintained
in the reservoirs to preserve endangered fish species that inhabit
the reservoirs. However, maintaining this water level threatened
Petitioners' beneficial and productive use of their property by
making the supply of irrigation water irregular.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Petitioners filed a &quot;citizen's suit&quot; under
Section 11(g)(1) of the ESA, challenging the decision on the ground
that the government failed to consider economic factors in making
the decision. The federal district court dismissed the suit, and
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding
that the petitioners' economic interest did not fall within the
&quot;zone of interests&quot; protected by the ESA.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Defenders has argued that Congress specifically included
economic factors among those to be considered in making decisions
under the ESA. Furthermore, protecting private property rights
and economic interests is an integral part of species conservation.
Therefore, economic interests are within the &quot;zone of interest&quot;
protected by the ESA and petitioners should have standing to bring
a citizen's suit to protect those interests.<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>Federal Pressure on Local School Board Violates
Constitution</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In <I>Sakaria &amp; Hillman v. Dare County (North
Carolina) Board of Education</I>, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
orchestrated the condemnation of private beachfront property for
wetland mitigation, by backing a county school board into a corner
over a required wetland permit. The owners of the property that
is being condemned are now petitioning the United States Supreme
Court to review their case.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Petitioners Elpis Sakaria and Mr. and Mrs. Hillman
each purchased a residential beachfront lot on Cape Hatteras Island,
North Carolina, to build a retirement home. Adjacent to the lots
is the local school. In 1988 the School Board needed to expand
the school's athletic field, to qualify the school for accreditation.
The Board owned 12.5 acres next door, enough for the expansion.
However, the Army Corps delineated 3 acres &quot;wetland,&quot;
and arbitrarily required the Board to create 1.84 acres of wetland
for each acre of wetland used to expand the field.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>From 1988 to 1992, the Army Corps rejected 41 sites
suggested for mitigation. With time growing short to obtain accreditation,
the Board &quot;negotiated&quot; an outcome with the Corps: the
Corps would grant a permit if the application included creating
a .5-acre wetland on the Sakaria and Hillman properties. The Board
filed the permit application, and immediately began to condemn
the private property. The property owners challenged the validity
of the condemnation of their property on Fifth and Tenth Amendment
grounds, but so far have been unsuccessful in court.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Defenders will file a brief <I>amici curaie</I> supporting
a Petition for Writ of Certiorari before the United States Supreme
Court arguing that 1) coercion by the Army Corps of the county
school board to carry out a federal objective at the local level
violates the Tenth Amendment and 2) a state agency violates the
Fifth Amendment when it uses its power of eminent domain to accomplish
a federal purpose unrelated to its narrow grant of eminent domain
authority.<BR>

<B>Hog-Wild Regulators Jeopardize Family Farm</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Warren family has been raising hogs in Chesapeake,
Virginia for three generations. But Earl Warren's livelihood is
now at risk because of a new city ordinance enacted specifically
to regulate him out of business.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>For over sixty years, the Warrens have operated a
traditional feed-lot hog farm. Over time, urban expansion has
moved into rural areas and now surrounds their farm. The Warrens,
however, have been able to adapt up until now by simply down-sizing
their operation.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Recently, the city has grown more aggressive in its
effort to make Chesapeake hog-fee, and adopted a new swine control
ordinance in April of 1992. Despite Mr. Warren's good faith attempts
to conform his hog-farming practices to the ordinance, many of
its mandates are arbitrary and have nothing to do with public
health and safety-making full compliance impossible. Indeed, the
farm has continued to comply with applicable environmental standards.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>If Mr. Warren does not fully comply, however, he
faces being shut down as a &quot;public nuisance.&quot; This flies
in the face of the U.S. Supreme Court's admonition in <I>Lucas
v. South Carolina Coastal Council</I> that a legislature cannot
simply decree a historically lawful use of property a &quot;nuisance&quot;
without compensation being paid to the owner. In a lawsuit filed
against Mr. Warren on March 30, 1995, the city has openly stated
in court that its goal is to permanently close down the farm.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Even though the city is suing Mr. Warren, it has
not yet met its own burden of demonstrating that the farm is a
nuisance according to Virginia common law. Defenders' attorney
Barry C. Hodge is defending Mr. Warren in Circuit Court in Chesapeake.
A trial was held on September 8, 1995, but the court has stayed
its decision to hear further evidence as to the feasibility of
complying with the ordinance.<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>Sell Columbia Gas Eight Inches and They'll Take
Fifty Feet</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In 1995, Deana Drain and her husband Robert were
forced, at their own expense, to move their home and shed to comply
with a utility company's claim of a fifty-foot right-of-way for
the gas line that crosses their .44 acre lot in Randolph County,
West Virginia.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In 1950, a right-of-way was sold to the gas company
across what is now the Drain's property to install an eight-inch
gas pipeline. The agreement did not specify the width of the right-of-way,
therefore full use was made of the property over the years. A
shed was built six inches from the line in 1962, and the Drains
installed their modular home seven and a half feet from it in
1992.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In April of 1993, however, Columbia Gas informed
the drains that their buildings encroached on the company's newly
claimed fifty-foot right-of-way, and later sued the Drains to
force them to move the buildings. According to Columbia, the Drains
cannot put any structures-including fences and trees-within twenty-five
feet of either side of the pipeline. The new easement affects
one-third of their property.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Columbia Gas bases its authority of federal pipeline
safety standards. Columbia asserts that these regulations allow
it to claim a fifty-foot right of way without having to purchase
the Drains' property through eminent domain. Federal regulation,
however, does not require a gas company to maintain a fifty-foot
right-of-way. Another inconsistency is that many other property
owners have buildings within the claimed easement boundaries who
have not been force to move them under pressure from the gas company.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>With Defenders serving as co-counsel, the Drains
filed a counterclaim alleging Columbia Gas's action was an unconstitutional
taking of their private property. After a three-day non-jury trial,
parties are now preparing post-trial documents.<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>California Religious Freedom/Property <BR>
Rights Violation</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Petitioner, Mrs. Evelyn Smith, earns a living by
renting four townhouses she owns in Chico, California. Due to
her religious beliefs, she refused to rent a townhouse to an unmarried
heterosexual couple. The couple complained to the California Fair
Employment and Housing Commission, which found Mrs. Smith guilty
of unlawful &quot;marital status discrimination&quot; under state
law and prohibited Mrs. Smith from excluding heterosexual unmarried
couples from her property, even though &quot;heterosexual couples&quot;
is not a constitutionally protected class. The California Supreme
Court affirmed the decision, stating that Mrs. Smith could have
avoided the conflict &quot;by selling her units and redeploying
the capital in other investments.&quot; Mrs. Smith has petitioned
the United States Supreme Court to review the decision, on the
basis that the California law violates her First Amendment right
to religious free exercise and her Fifth Amendment property rights.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Defenders presented the Fifth Amendment argument
in its brief to the Court supporting Mrs. Smith's petition for
review, that the California law violates Fifth Amendment rights.
Specifically, the law deprives Mrs. Smith of her right to exclude
others, which is among the property rights protected by the Fifth
Amendment Just Compensation Clause, and which has been identified
by the United States Supreme Court as one of the most fundamental
aspects of property ownership.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Challenge to Large-Lot Zoning on Chappaquiddick</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court will hear
a challenge to a local zoning by-law that imposes a three-acre
minimum to build on residential lots on Chappaquiddick. The purported
public interest underlying the three-acre minimum was environmental
protection.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Petitioner Herring Creek Farm owns 215 acres of residential
property on the Island and had planned to develop it with homes
on one-acre lots for low- to moderate-income families. At trial,
Herring Creek showed that the three acre minimum did not advance
the stated environmental goals and further that the large lot
sizes makes home ownership nearly impossible for middle- and lower-income
families. The trial court upheld the by-law. This appeal to the
highest court in the state followed directly from that decision,
bypassing the intermediate appeals court due to the interest in
the high court in establishing statewide guidance on this issue.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Defenders argued as <I>amicus curiae</I> supporting
Herring Creed that the zoning restriction is constitutionally
invalid because it fails to &quot;substantially advance&quot;
the government interest in protecting the environment. The United
States Supreme Court has held that a law that derogates from private
property rights is invalid if the law does not substantially advance
the goal sought to be achieved by the law. Oral argument is currently
scheduled before the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court.<BR>

<P>
<B>Indians Claim Right to Harvest Shellfish on Private Property</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Years before Washington became a state, the United
States purchased by treaty from 16 Northwest Indian Tribes the
right to use the beach and surrounding upland in Puget Sound.
Under the treaties, the Tribes retained their right to take &quot;fish&quot;
from all customary locations not staked off or occupied by settlers.
The State of Washington later took title to the tidelands and
sold them to private citizens. These private landowners have &quot;seeded&quot;
the tidelands to create new shellfish beds, and have harvested
the shellfish, enjoying exclusive use and quiet enjoyment of the
tidelands for over a century.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Now the United States-on behalf of the Tribes-is
suing the State of Washington, claiming that the Tribes' right
to &quot;fish&quot; includes the right to harvest shellfish even
on privately owned tidelands. The United States has offered no
payment of just compensation for its destruction of these private
property rights on behalf of the Indian Tribes. The outcome of
this case between the federal and state governments will affect
200,000 private property owners. The federal district court decided
the case in favor of the Tribes. The case is now before the United
States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Defenders filed a brief <I>amicus curiae</I> in the
Ninth Circuit on behalf of 65,000 members of the Upland Property
Owners of Washington (UPOW), which has intervened in the lawsuit.
Defenders advanced three property rights arguments. First, the
United States' claim to fishing rights for the Tribes constitutes
a physical invasion of private property and second, destroys the
private owners' investment-backed expectations in the tidelands.
Third, Defenders argued that the government's position in this
case violates the Equal Footing Doctrine, which requires that
any state admitted to the Union must be granted all rights and
privileges given to the original thirteen states.<BR>

<B>Milwaukee School Choice Action</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>As expected, Wisconsin Circuit Court Judge Paul Higginbotham
in August refused to lift an injunction preventing Milwaukee school
children from attending religious schools in the choice program,
and ruled that the program violates the religion clause of the
Wisconsin Constitution. However, the judge dissolved the remainder
of the injunction, meaning that at least 300 more youngsters will
be able to attend nonsectarian schools this year.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The ruling followed four hours of testimony and three
hours of oral argument. Former Milwaukee Public Schools superintendent
Howard Fuller led off with testimony on why the choice program
is essential not only to expand opportunities for minority and
economically disadvantaged kids, but to foment needed reform in
the public schools.  Zakiya Courtney testified on the real-world
effects of the program and the injunction. Two parents, Pilar
Gonzalez and Val Johnson-representing hundreds of others-offered
personal perspectives on what private schools have meant for their
children and economic burdens the families face in keeping them
there. Harvard professor Paul Peterson testified on his recent
study finding substantial academic gains among choice students.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Unfortunately, it was clear that Judge Higginbotham,
though moved by IJ's witnesses' testimony, found the religious
school aspect of the program untenable. He concluded that the
Wisconsin Constitution is more prohibitive than the First Amendment,
and that the program's &quot;primary effect&quot; is to advance
religion.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>But Judge Higginbotham was not persuaded that the
plaintiffs showed a reasonable likelihood of prevailing on their
other state constitutional claims, so he lifted the rest of the
injunction on the enrollment caps. That means the number of eligible
students increases from 1,500 to 15,000; and that schools may
enroll up to 100 percent of their students from the choice program
(up from 65 percent.) Last year, about 1,500 choice students were
enrolled in nonsectarian schools in the choice program. This year,
about 1,900 applied to nonsectarian schools. They now will be
able to attend, which also somewhat relieves the pressure on the
PAVE program to provide scholarships.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>On the litigation front, IJ will attempt to extricate
the religion issues from the remainder of the case and seek an
immediate appeal of that portion of the judge's ruling. The non-religion
issues are schedule for three rounds of briefs and argument before
Judge Higginbotham over the next three months. Also, on the eve
of the hearing, the NAACP filed a lawsuit claiming the expanded
program promotes racial segregation. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Religious School Choice in Vermont</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The IJ will file a lawsuit this week against the State of Vermont
on behalf of the Chittenden school board. The board voted to include
religious high schools among those available to students at public
expense. (Vermont towns that have no public  high schools pay
tuition for students at neighboring public high schools or private
schools.) Contending that tuition payment at religious schools
chosen by parents violates the First Amendment, the state has
cut off all education funds to the town, even though the portion
that would be allocated for religious high school tuition constitutes
only two percent of the town's education funding.</FONT><BR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The IJ will seek a preliminary injunction in state
court, arguing that (1) including religious schools among the
options does not violate the First Amendment, (2) exclusion of
religious schools violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act,
and (3) the cutoff of state funds exceeds the state's authority.

<B>Landmark Legal Foundation Blasts Senate Ethics Committee</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Landmark Legal Foundation, co-counsel to former RTC
criminal investigator L. Jean Lewis, who last year testified before
the Senate Special Committee investigating Whitewater, blasted
the Senate Ethics Committee for its failure to sanction Maryland
Senator Paul Sarbanes and the Whitewater Committee's minority
chief counsel, Richard Ben-Veniste, for their use of a private
letter written by Lewis, which was &quot;undeleted&quot; from
a computer diskette.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;The Ethics Committee completely abdicated its
responsibility to Ms. Lewis and to all Americans. Senators and
Senate staffers are not above the law,&quot; said Landmark President
Mark R. Levin, who filed the ethics complaint on Lewis's behalf
last December. &quot;They are not free to behave as rogue federal
police violating the privacy rights of witnesses appearing before
Congress. Nor are they free to take a witness's personal property,
which they did in this case.&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Lewis's 22-page personal letter, which was unrelated
to Lewis's work in investigating Madison Guaranty Savings and
Loan and the Whitewater Development Corporation, was apparently
retrieved by computer technicians from a computer diskette Lewis
produced in response to the Senate Whitewater Committee's subpoena
for information relevant to her investigative work. Since her
letter was not subject to the Whitewater Committee's subpoena
as it fell outside its subject matter and time frame, when Senator
Sarbanes and Ben-Veniste retrieved it from the diskette they violated
Ms. Lewis's Fourth Amendment privacy rights.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Astonishingly, the Ethics Committee did not
talk with Ms. Lewis or her counsel at any time during the nine
months following the filing of the complaint, though it apparently
interviewed Senator Sarbanes and Ben-Veniste to return to Ms.
Lewis her personal property; and, it offered no explanation or
justification for its summary dismissal of our complaint,&quot;
declared Levin. &quot;When the Constitution can be so easily trampled,
when an individual's rights can be so easily ignored, and when
Ethics Committee members close their eyes to these abuses, there
is something terribly wrong in the U.S. Senate.&quot;<BR>

<B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Federal Appeals Court to Determine
Whether Students' Rights to Free Speech Includes Giving Religious
Messages At Graduation Ceremonies</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>On August 14, 1996, the Eleventh Circuit Court of
Appeals reheard oral arguments in the case of <I>Adler v. Duval
County School Board</I>. This case is on appeal from a decision
of a federal district court in Florida which held that a school
board policy permitting students to determine what type of graduation
message they would give does not violate the Constitution, even
if that message includes religious speech. Arguments were presented
to the Eleventh Circuit in March 1995 on this case. The court
did not hand down a decision, but instead has asked to hear further
argument.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The case began in May 1993 by challenging a school
board policy allowing the graduating senior class to elect to
have two minutes of uncensored speech to open or close the graduation
ceremonies. If the students chose to utilize the two minutes,
they would then elect a fellow student to address the class. The
content of the message was to be determined by the student addressing
the class and was not to be censored by the school. The school
policy allowed students to give any type of message, from poetic
speech to religious speech. During the 1993 graduation ceremonies
of the 17 schools in Duval County, 6 senior classes chose either
no message or a secular message, while the remaining 11 chose
a religious message.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The ACLU brought suit on behalf of 3 students against
the Duval County School Board arguing that this policy allowed
religious messages or prayer and thus violated the First Amendment.
Liberty Counsel, a religious civil liberties legal defense organization,
intervened on behalf of 11 students to defend the school policy,
arguing that the free speech rights of students was at stake.
If the school board were to lose the case, the students' free
speech rights would be taken away.<BR>

<B>Local Residents Are &quot;Environmentalists&quot; too</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The men and women of northwestern Montana and northern
Idaho have just as much right to sue regarding violations of federal
environmental statutes as do organized environmental groups says
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. In a decision
reversing a federal district court ruling, the appeals court held
that rural residents of the timber producing area have legal standing
regarding environmental issues despite the fact that their primary
concern is economic. In addition, the court held that statutes
governing the management of national forests are dedicated to
timber harvesting activities and that the local resident may sue
to challenge U.S. Forest Service decisions reducing allowable
timber harvests.<BR>

<B>MSLF Help Stops U.S. Forest Service</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A property owner in northern California says the
willingness of MSLF to provide her legal assistance brought an
almost immediate concession from the U.S. Forest Service (USFS),
even before MSLF filed a single document. For years, the USFS
had used the property of Kate Novoa without permission. Yet when
she objected, the USFS asserted that it had an easement over her
land. Remarkably, the USFS never produced documented proof of
its alleged easement. When Ms. Novoa advised USFS officials that
MSLF was willing to provide her legal assistance, the USFS suddenly
discovered that it had no easement over her land and agreed to
end its use of her property.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>The ability of tribal court to exercise jurisdiction

set forth in the U.S. Constitution are ignored, has been challenged
by a brief filed by MSLF. In a friend of the court brief filed

that tribal courts have very limited jurisdiction, jurisdiction
limited to those who willingly subject themselves to such jurisdiction.

<B>MSLF Fights Land Lockup</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The decision by the Clinton Administration to put
yet another species protected by the Endangered Species Act (ESA)
in the mountain West has drawn a lawsuit from San Juan County,
Utah. Under the plan announced by Bruce Babbitt's Department of
the Interior, California Condors (&quot;Gymnogyps californianus&quot;)
would be released in the Vermillion Cliffs of northern Arizona,
from whence they will fly over Utah, Arizona, and Nevada-an area
larger than the State of Ohio. San Juan County filed a lawsuit
challenging the legality of Babbitt's plan. MSLF has agreed to
serve as co-counsel to the San Juan County Attorney.<BR>

<B>Forest Service Ignores Facts - Locks Out Miners</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Clinton Administration officials have taken steps
to prevent mining in Park County, Colorado by creating what they
call the Hoosier Ridge Research Natural Area (RNA). But in so
doing, they have ignored the fact that the proposed area does
not meet the requirements of federal regulation that the area
be &quot;virgin&quot; and &quot;unmodified&quot; by act of man.
In addition, the area contains numerous mining claims of which
the federal government is well aware. Remarkably, none of the
federal documents supporting the creation of the Hoosier Ridge
NRA addresses the fact that the are is neither &quot;virgin&quot;
nor &quot;unmodified&quot; or the fact that mining claims are
present. As a result, MSLF filed a lawsuit on behalf of the Park
County Mining Association and others seeking to have the RNA classification
revoked and the land returned to multiple use.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>Babbitt's National Park Service has abandoned its
plan to close Devils Tower to commercial climbing during the month
of June each year. The agency's decision comes almost two months
to the day following a ruling by a Wyoming federal district court
that the closure violates the Constitution. The Park Service's
abandonment of the commercial climbing ban at Devils Tower came
in a surprise announcement in the <I>Federal Register</I>. Despite
the Park Service's decision regarding commercial climbing, the
lawsuit will continue because the Park Service has restricted
noncommercial access to Devils Tower and has engaged in promotional
activities regarding the religious beliefs of Native Americans.

<I><B>En Banc</B></I><B> Sixth Circuit Splits</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In a lawsuit brought by property owners on Crooked
Lake in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Sixth Circuit split 7 to 7 on overturning an earlier holding
by a Michigan federal district court. The Michigan court had held
that the phrase &quot;valid existing rights&quot; did not protect
the riparian rights of lake front property owners. A ruling by
a three judge panel of the Sixth Circuit that upheld the Michigan
court was vacated when an <I>en banc</I> hearing was granted.
Judge Danny Boggs, in a 40-page opinion, chastised both the federal
government, for its interpretation of the phrase &quot;valid existing
rights,&quot; and the other seven members of the court for upsetting
a delicate legislative compromise that permitted the designation
of the Sylvania Wilderness Area.<BR>

<B>Babbitt Agency Appeals Panel Denies Self Defense Plea</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In a case involving the Montana man who has become
the poster child for Endangered Species Act (ESA) abuse, the Interior
Board of Land Appeals (IBLA) has ruled that self defense may not
be claimed in the death of a grizzly bear. John Shuler, who killed
a grizzly bear when confronted in his own yard, was convicted
of a violation of the ESA despite his plea of self defense. An
Administrative Law Judge ruled that although Shuler reasonably
feared for his life (the necessary precedent for the use of deadly
force), he could not claim self-defense since he was at fault
for introducing himself into &quot;the zone of imminent danger.&quot;
The IBLA upheld that remarkable ruling, declaring that since Shuler
knew a grizzly bear was outside, he should not have left his house.
Since the IBLA's ruling conflicts with the law on self-defense
(a homeowner may confront an armed intruder on his own property),
MSLF will file a lawsuit in federal court.</FONT>

must list their assets (including possible law suits) as well
as debts as part of the bankruptcy process. Otherwise, as the
case here, a bankrupt could shed debts owed to creditors while
preserving his assets for his own enjoyment, a blatantly unfair

<B>NELF Tries to Retain Local Control Over Land Use in Vermont</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Applewood Corporation wants to convert a vacant commercial
building in Dummerston, Vermont into a day care center. But its
plan hit a roadblock in Vermont's Act 250. A jurisdictional opinion
by Vermont's Environmental Board held that the Town did not have
authority over this small-scale project (which the Town meeting
has approved) because the Town had not used proper procedures
to adopt its subdivision rules. That let the state-wide Board
assert authority over the project.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>But the Board requires preparation of an expensive
application for all Act 250 permits. Requiring preparation of
such a permit will most likely result in the death knell for the
day care center. To prevent that , NELF filed an <I>amicus</I>
brief, in its name, supporting an appeal of the jurisdictional
ruling. The Board will now decide whether to allow a paperwork
snafu to kill a needed day care center.<BR>

<B>NELF Brief Helps Win Connecticut Unemployment Labor Dispute</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A Connecticut judge has agreed with NELF that striking
workers should not receive unemployment benefits for three months
while they were on strike. The case involves a labor dispute at
Yankee Gas. The company offered a raise but announced a plan to
later change medical benefits. The union did not immediately strike,
but refused to commit to staying on the job during negotiations.
Realizing that would leave its operations at the union's mercy,
Yankee put its offer into effect. The union promptly struck and
its members filed for unemployment benefits.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The state ordered benefits paid to the workers because
it felt portions of Yankee's offer were inferior to the prior
contract. Yankee appealed. NELF's <I>amicus</I> brief with the
Superior Court, in the name of the Connecticut Business and Industry
Association argued that the refusal to commit to staying on the
job prevented the union from claiming a lockout. The judge agreed
and reversed the order to pay unemployment benefits. He also noted
that the state should have reviewed the final offer to see if,
viewed as a package, it was inferior to the expired contract.

safety helmets on the job. As part of a labor dispute, some workers
demanded the right to wear union insignia on those white helmets
and filed an unfair labor charge when Northeast refused. The NLRB
ruled against Northeast.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In its own name, NELF filed an <I>amicus</I> brief
supporting Northeast's appeal. NELF argued that the Board should
have balanced Northeast's legitimate safety concerns against the
union desire to proselytizing rather than adopting a <I>per se</I>
rule. The case is awaiting argument before the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the First Circuit.<BR>

to pay the costs of waste disposals made as much as 150 years

<B>NELF Breaks Open Boston Taxi Monopoly</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Acting in a case filed by NELF on behalf of a Boston
taxi driver, a Massachusetts Superior Court judge has ordered
Boston to issue the first new taxi &quot;medallions&quot; (licenses)
in 50 years. After 50 years in which only 1525 cabs were allowed
on Boston's streets, market forces will finally be given a chance
to operate in the taxi business.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>NELF represents Robert Lynch who has been trying
to own and operate his own cab in Boston for more than 10 years.
In 1991, NELF persuaded the Massachusetts Supreme Court to uphold
an agency order that the public convenience required issuance
of at least 300 new medallions. The state Department of Public
Utilities then ordered Boston to issue those medallions &quot;immediately.&quot;
But Boston, under pressure from the existing taxi operators, dug
in its heels and did nothing.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>After fruitless negotiation, NELF filed a mandamus
action on Mr. Lynch's behalf, which led to the Superior Court's
decision. These new medallions, the first since World War II,
will increase availability of taxis in areas now underserved,
particularly in low income and minority neighborhoods, and will
open new entrepreneurial opportunities.<BR>

a fiduciary under ERISA, the federal pension law.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>NELF in its own name filed an <I>amicus </I>brief
with the Court, which argued that the fiduciary standard should
not and could not apply to a company's dealings with its own employees.
Use of that standard would require companies to put employees'
interests above shareholders, in violation of corporate law. The

<B>NELF Enters Class Action Fray</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>NELF has joined with Lawyers for Civil Justice, a
Washington-based public interest group asking the U.S. Court of
Appeals in Philadelphia to reconsider a decision which overturned
a settlement of a millions of prospective asbestos-related cases.
In this, <I>Georgine v. Amchem</I>, the District Court used a
Rule 23 class action to approve a single settlement in one &quot;case&quot;
which disposed of millions of individual cases. Notwithstanding
the proposed settlement, the Court of Appeals reviewed the class
action settlement to see if the underlying &quot;case&quot; could
have met requirements of Rule 23. Because it did not, the court
vacated the settlement.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Unless reversed, the consequences of this decision
on business and the judicial system will be dramatic and negative.
Instead of one comprehensive and fair settlement that resolves
the issue and caps businesses' exposure, there will be years of
litigation with inconsistent judgments, enormous legal expenses
and a lack of predictability. The upshot will be that, while some
plantiffs may get more money, many will get less, far more money
will be spent on legal fees and kept by plaintiffs' lawyers, and
courts will be crowded with hundreds of thousands of complex,
repetitious cases.<BR>

prepared by NELF in a tax case which tested whether the state's
tax coded can be adapted to modern manufacturing techniques. The

involved whether a major publisher, which had subcontracted a
number of physical tasks like binding while continuing to perform
high technology work like organizing texts and designing CD/ROMS,

status provides a business with significant tax incentives to
increase investment and employment.<BR>

<B>Court Allows Second Bite at the Apple</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>California Assemblyman Tom Bates (D-Berkeley) is
fighting tooth and nail to get a &quot;second bite at the apple.&quot;
He and a handful of his supporters have filed suit in federal
court trying yet again to strike down term limits. Furthermore,
Bates' bid to undo the state term limits is being given a sympathetic
ear by a federal trial court that is disregarding PLF's precedent-setting
victory in <I>Legislature v. Eu</I> and is heading down its own
path requiring the validity of Proposition 140 to be litigated
through the court system all over again!<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The court has refused to dismiss the lawsuit and
has given Mr. Bates great latitude to make up arguments for keeping
his suit alive. For instance, the Berkeley lawmaker has argued
that since he was not individually named as a party to the first
Proposition 140 lawsuit, he was not bound by it. Well, Mr. Bates
may not have been named in that prior suit, but an investigation
of documents filed with the Fair Practices Commission revealed
that he helped underwrite it.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Public records show that Mr. Bates spent $12,000
trying to defeat Proposition 140 at the ballot box, and when that
failed, he paid another $1,000 directly to the law firm that represented
the Legislature in the California Supreme Court for the purpose
of supporting the first challenge to state term limits. In addition,
a subpoena of that law firm's billing records revealed that not
only did Tom Bates help finance <I>Legislature v. Eu</I> litigation,
but 39 of his colleagues who were not parties to that case also
contributed to the lawsuit- to the tune of $229,000! With this
information  in hand, PLF went back to federal court demanding
again that Mr. Bates be bound by the first lawsuit and that his
suit be dismissed.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In spite of Mr. Bates' obvious involvement in the
prior case, the federal court decided that he could start the
case all over again in her court because in her opinion his contribution
was too small a sum to buy him &quot;control&quot; over the prior
lawsuit. The court would not accept that 58 legislators challenged
Proposition 140 in 1991 by either lending their names to the complaint
or by opening their pocketbooks, with nonparty legislators underwriting
 half the lawsuit. Instead the court has permitted the lawmaker's
lawyers to recruit two Democratic Assemblywomen, Barbara Friedman
and Martha Escutia, as additional plaintiffs in the lawsuit.

<B>Voting Districts Drawn by Race Rules Unconstitutional</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In another victory for equal protection, the United
States Supreme Court held on June 13, that election districts
in Texas and North Carolina that were drawn along racial boundaries
are unconstitutional. PLF argued in both cases that race is an
inappropriate criteria for drawing lines for congressional districts
and that the interests of all Americans are ill-served by political
boundaries that isolate minority voters in so-called &quot;majority-minority&quot;
districts.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Texas' 18th, 29th, 30th and North Carolina's 12th
congressional districts were oddly configured and bizarre in their
geographic configurations. There was nothing compact or contiguous
about the districts in question which were drawn for the sole
purpose of assuring the election of black representatives, while
completely disregarding traditional districting principles. In
both cases, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed with the arguments made
by PLF which has long advocated individual rights over group rights
and the necessity for government to act in a color-blind manner,
both in the context of &quot;affirmative action&quot; programs
and in the context of the Voting Rights Act. The Supreme Court
also rebuffed the Department of Justice's continuing attempts
to coerce states into a &quot;max-black&quot; scheme of maximizing
the number of minority districts, even when there is no compelling
reason to do so.<BR>

<B>Fate of Santa Monica Rent Control Before State Supreme Court</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Under the pretext of &quot;helping the poor and the
elderly&quot; the Santa Monica rent control bureaucrats have been
taking rental property owners to the cleaners while expanding
the scope of regulation and control of rental properties throughout
the city. And yet, despite the economic and social harms it causes,
rent control remains a source of long-term security and prosperity
for the bureaucrats and huge administrative staffs need to keep
the program operating.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Using 1980-1990 census data from Berkeley, Santa
Monica, and Cotati, a California Apartment Association-PLF Rent
Control Project study reveals the damaging impact rent control
has on housing and people-particularly the poor, minorities and
the elderly. The study proves the bureaucrats wrong, rent control
does not accomplish what was originally intended, and this is
evidence that cannot be ignored.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The CAA-PLF Rent Control Project fired its first
salvo in the war against rent control on March 16, 1994, against
the City of Santa Monica. That suit charged, among other things,
that Santa Monica's rent control ordinance effects an uncompensated
taking of private property in violation of the U.S. Constitution.
In addition to showing that the rent regulations fail to advance
any legitimate governmental interest (and therefore are unconstitutional),
the suit challenges the local rent board's bizarre accounting
practices and determined whether owners receive a &quot;fair return.&quot;
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A trial court threw out PLF's lawsuit claiming the
rent control board had a &quot;rational basis&quot; for imposing
its restrictions. Under this weak standard, rental property owners
have little hope of successfully challenging such measures as
unconstitutional takings. Fortunately, the California Court of
Appeal overturned that trial court decision in this case, ruling
that courts must not take challenges to rent control too lightly
and instead must examine such cases with a higher level of scrutiny.
In so holding, the court unanimously rejected the idea-urged by
the Rent Control Board and accepted by the trial judge-that courts
must uphold rent ordinances if they can imagine any conceivable
rational basis for enactment.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The court determined that if rental property owners
can prove that a rent control law has denied them economically
viable use of their land or fails to substantially advance a legitimate
government interest, then that law &quot;goes too far.&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In so ruling, the Court of Appeal ordered the trial
court to conduct a full trial and hear PLF's damaging evidence.
Greatly disturbed by the prospect of having to defend its rent
control regime and accompanying socialist policies, the city sought
refuge in the California Supreme Court where the case presently
sits.<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The city of Atlanta in September enacted a &quot;domestic
partners&quot; ordinance, allowing for non-married<B> </B>partners
of City employees to receive healthcare and other benefits. SLF
filed suit in local superior court challenging the constitutionality
of the ordinance. A similar ordinance was enacted in 1993, and
SLF's lawsuit against the City in that case was successfully decided
by the Georgia Supreme Court. The Court held that the City ordinance
defined specifically both &quot;dependence&quot; and &quot;family&quot;
for purposes of justifying the extension of employee benefits
in a manner which conflicted with the state constitution and statutes
and was therefore unconstitutional and void.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In the present case, the City ordinance similarly
defines &quot;dependent&quot; in a manner which SLF attorneys
contend conflicts with state law. In a press conference held in
Atlanta in September to announce the lawsuit, SLF President Matthew
J. Glavin told the press corps, &quot;Atlanta has once again crossed
the line drawn by the General Assembly and the Georgia Supreme
Court by attempting to recognize relationships not recognized

WLF attorneys from taking his deposition regarding this clearly
unconstitutional FDA policy of censorship, and ordered him to
appear for a two-hour deposition. Justice Department and FDA attorneys,
however, are seeking to appeal that decision.<BR>

<B>WLF Represents Congressmen Seeking to Uphold &quot;3/5 Rule&quot;
on Taxes</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>WLF recently filed a brief in the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the D.C. Circuit in <I>Skaggs v. Carle</I> on behalf of 22
U.S. Senators and Representatives who are defending the constitutionality
of the House's recently adopted &quot;3/5 Rule&quot; on taxes.
The rule, which requires a three-fifths vote rather than a simple
majority to raise taxes, is under attack by several Democrats
in the House and a variety of liberal organizations.  WLF's brief
argues that the plaintiffs claims are not justiciable and the
Constitution imposes no restraints on the House of Representatives'
power to adopt procedural rules.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>Supporting Tort Reform for Municipal Governments</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>WLF recently asked the U.S. Supreme Court to throw
out a huge tort award imposed on an Oklahoma county because one
of its deputy sheriffs allegedly used excessive force when pulling
a motorist from her car during a traffic stop following a high-speed
chase. WLF argued in <I>Bryan County v. Brown</I> that while public-sector
employees can be sued under the Civil Rights Act of 1871 if they
violate someone's constitutional rights, a municipality should
not be held liable for the actions of its employees unless those
actions were taken pursuant to some established municipal policy.
WLF urged the Court to reject the lower court's determination
that such a policy can be found to exist based simply on the municipality's
alleged negligence in hiring the deputy sheriff. WLF argued that
plaintiffs should be required to demonstrate that the municipality
repeatedly has made negligent hiring decisions.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>WLF Demands Probe of FDA's Contacts with Plaintiffs' Bar</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>WLF recently demanded that HHSs Inspector General
launch an investigation of meetings between senior FDA officials
and members of the plaintiffs' bar. FDA officials have had repeated
contacts with plaintiffs' lawyers who are pushing FDA to take
action unfavorable to the many pharmaceutical and medical device
companies who are targets of class action lawsuits. WLF recently
determined through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit that FDA
has been failing to keep written records of all such meetings,
as it is required to do by law. WLF is demanding that the Inspector
General investigate the full extent of the violations by senior
FDA personnel. WLF charges that by attempting to hide their meetings
with plaintiffs' lawyers, FDA officials create the impression
that the agency has become beholden to a politically powerful
interest group, at the expense of the health and safety of the
American people.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>High Court Sides with WLF in First Amendment Challenge to FEC
Rule</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Supreme Court in late June struck down a Federal
Election Commission rule that restricted party committees in making
independent expenditures in connection with congressional elections.
The ruling in <I>Colorado Republican Fed. Campaign Comm. v. FEC</I>
was a victory for WLF, which had represented eight Members of
Congress as well as former Senator Eugene McCarthy in the case.
The High Court accepted WLF's argument that the First Amendment
prohibits restrictions on the type of independent political speech
(i.e., campaign spending not directly controlled by a candidate)
at issue in this case.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>Court Once Again Says No to Racial Gerrymandering</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Supreme Court in late June struck down racially
gerrymandered congressional districts in North Carolina and Texas,
holding that the Equal Protection Clause prohibits using race
as the predominant factor in drawing electoral lines. In the Texas
case, <I>Bush v. Vera</I>, WLF had represented Linda Chavez's
Center for Equal Opportunity and several Members of Congress who
opposed dividing the electorate along racial lines. WLF argued
that racial gerrymandering is unnecessary to permit blacks and
Hispanics to compete in elections on an equal footing and promotes
divisiveness between people of different races.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>Commercial Speech Rights Supported</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>WLF continued its strong advocacy of commercial speech
when it argued this month in the Maryland Court of Appeals (that
state's highest court) that Maryland may not constitutionally
restrict the right of businesses to advertise going-out-of-business
sales. Maryland imposes strict licensing requirements on all such
advertising and has been attempting to fine a furniture store
that advertised a liquidation sale without first jumping through
all necessary bureaucratic hoops. WLF argues in <I>Jakanna Woodworks,
Inc. v. Montgomery County</I> that the First Amendment bars Maryland
from attempting to suppress advertising that the State does not
claim is false or misleading and that calls attention to activities
that are fully legal (indeed, that are not even subject to regulation
in Maryland).<BR>

<h3>July-August, 1996 <i>Insider</i></h3> 
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>National Fatherhood Initiative
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<hr><P>
<font size=3> 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;




	On almost every indicator of child well-being, children today fare worse than their counterparts just a generation ago. The reason: the dramatic rise, over the last thirty years, in the number of children living in fatherless households.  Indeed, children growing up without fathers are more likely to fail at school or to drop out, engage in early sexual activity, develop drug and alcohol problems, and experience or perpetrate violence.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The National Fatherhood Initiative was founded three years ago to counter the growing problem of fatherlessness by stimulating a broad-based social movement to restore responsible fatherhood as a national priority. With the support and involvement of such notable Americans as former U.S. Education Secretary <a href="/heritage/staff/bennett.htm">William Bennett</a>, actor James Earl Jones, and pollster George Gallup, we developed the following three-part strategy for ensuring that more children grow up with a loving father. <p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

First, we are pursuing an aggressive public education campaign highlighting the importance of fathers to the well-being of children and communities.  In fact, NFI has netted nearly 20,000 media mentions over the past two years. In addition, we have developed, in conjunction with the Ad Council, a national public service announcement (PSA) campaign to raise the awareness of every American that fathers make unique and irreplaceable contributions to the lives of their children, and that collectively we need to support and encourage men to be good and responsible fathers. One of these ads has appeared nearly a half dozen times in <i>USA Today</i>. In partnership with Radio America, we have also developed a series of two dozen radio PSAs featuring such prominent Americans as former HUD Secretary Jack Kemp, Senator Dan Coats, General Colin Powell, Senator Bill Bradley, Congressman and former Seattle Seahawk Steve Largent, and Penn State football coach Joe Paterno.
	<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Second, we are organizing coalitions of national and local community leaders committed to creating a culture that values and supports good fathers. In October of 1994, we convened the first ever National Summit on Fatherhood in Dallas, Texas, where hundreds of our nation's civic, business, and philanthropic leaders gathered to begin building a national consensus on the need to quickly reduce father absence. We then organized and hosted an interfaith leadership summit on fatherhood in June 1996. This summit attracted dozens of representatives from various faiths who discussed ideas for encouraging, both individually and collectively, engaged fathering.  Additionally, we are partnering with national civic organizations, including United Way of America and Boys and Girls Clubs of America, to stimulate local voluntary efforts toward father-friendly community building.
	<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
We are also increasingly working with the nation's governors.  For example, NFI was recently awarded a contract by the Virginia  Department of Health to implement a state-wide fatherhood promotion campaign as part of Governor George Allen's citizen empowerment initiative.  As the coordinator of this effort, NFI developed a series of state-specific PSAs, hosted local fatherhood forums throughout the state, and developed a resource center to assist grassroots organizations and individuals to implement local fatherhood promotion efforts.
	<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In addition to our work in Virginia, NFI has been asked to provide consultation and advice to such diverse governors as William Weld of Massachusetts, Roy Romer of Colorado, Pete Wilson of California, and Birch Bayh of Indiana, as each seeks to find ways to promote, rather than discourage, responsible fatherhood through state policy initiatives. To help support our state policy work, NFI recently co-authored a document entitled "Seven Things States Can Do To Promote Responsible Fatherhood." Published by the NGA's Council of Governors' Policy Advisors, this report has been widely disseminated to state and local government officials.
	<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Third, we are taking our pro-fatherhood message directly to individual men.  Through the skill building and community resource materials, we provide information on how men can become better fathers, and how local communities can promote, encourage, and support fathers.  One of our most successful publications, Father Facts, contains national data on trends in fatherhood, as well as research documenting the negative consequences of father absence.  We also publish a resource catalogue containing books, tapes, and other fatherhood products.
	<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There is substantial evidence that our efforts are beginning to bear fruit. Whether reflected in stadiums filled with Promise Keepers, the streets of our nation's capital inundated with Million Man Marchers, or news stories highlighting the connection between absent fathers and such diverse social ills as crime, educational failure and welfare dependency, fatherhood is in the air. Virtually everyone-from Dan Quayle to Bill Clinton-now agrees: fathers matter, and they matter a lot more than many had previously realized.
	<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The job, however, is only half done.  Though few still argue seriously that fathers are superfluous, the number of children growing up in father absent households continues to rise.  This year, more than a million children will experience the divorce or separation of their parents. An additional 1.3 million babies will be fathered out of wed-lock. Overall, nearly 2.5 million children will join the ranks of the fatherless.
	<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Certainly, much has been accomplished.  But we must not delude ourselves into believing that the struggle to renew fatherhood has been won. Far too many children grow up in homes without fathers. The most important battles are still before us.  Achieving attitudinal change may be hard; but behavioral change is even harder.  And that is what our children need most of all.

<b>Neoisolationism and Global Realities,</b> by Murray Weidenbaum<p>
<i>Policy Study</i> No. 130, Center for the Study of American Business<p>
Murray Weidenbaum, Director of the Center for the Study of American Business, argues that the U.S. cannot revert to isolationist policies in the post-Cold War era given the current and strong trends towards globalization. To support his argument, Weidenbaum presents eight major points which illustrate the increasingly strong movement towards globaliliztion. First, he states that existing technology and international competition have already made America part of the global marketplace. Second, he points to the fact that U.S. businesses are increasingly participating in the international economy given the potential high profits and growth rates. Third, he presents the argument that with growing numbers of cross-border alliances, transnational enterprises are becoming more and more common. Then, Weidenbaum argues that the booming economies and little government regulation in some foreign countries, have made it so the rewards of foreign investment far outweight the risks of political instability. The fifth point is the attraction the diversifying of investments internationally holds to businessmen seeking to minimize their vulnerabiltiy to regional recessions. Next he points out that the U.S. can not ignore the rise of China and other Southeastern Asian countries as Economic powerhouses; it must be prepared to compete with them both in the U.S. and Asian markets. Similarly, the continued process of economic unification in Western Europe and the growing strength of Germany, also demands a U.S. presence in the global marketplace. Finally, he argues that given the United States strong economy, too much potential for further growth exists in the international sphere that would be lost should the U.S. choose to follow an isolationist course.  Weidenbaum concludes by asserting that protectionism does not work and that as the twenty-first century approaches, private enterprises, not government, will lead the U.S.'s movements on the global stage. 16pp. CONTACT: Center for the Study of American Business, Washington Univers

<a href="/heritage/library/categories/natsec/fyi103.html">Flawed Intelligence Report No Guide for Missile Threat</a>, by <a href="/heritage/staff/spring.htm">Baker Spring</a><p>
<i>F.Y.I.</i> No. 103, The Heritage Foundation<p>
In his assessment of the U.S. intelligence community's 1995 report on America's need for a missile defense system, Senior Policy Analyst at The Heritage Foundation Baker Spring argues that given a host of inconsistencies, the report should not be used by members of Congress to help them determine their votes on the Defend America Act.  The act would commit America to the deployment of a missile defense system by 2003, but the intelligence community's report asserts that the U.S. is under no real threat of a missile attack in the near future.  Spring writes, however, that the authors of the assessment: 1) fail to address the threat posed by long-range missiles in China and Russia; 2) write off Alaska and Hawaii as territory to defend against missile attack; 3) are overly optimistic about how long it will take rogue states to develop long-range missiles; 4) unwisely downplay the potential impact of foreign assistance on the missile threat to America; 5) underestimate the impact of space launch vehicle development on missile proliferation; 6) are completely unrealistic about the potential sale of long-range missiles and space launch vehicles; and 7) inexplicably dismiss the threat of accidental or unauthorized launches against the U.S. Baker concludes by raising questions about the legitimacy of the report, noting that the General Accounting Office has launched an investigation to determine if the Clinton Administration intervened in the production of the report. 4pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a><p>

<a href="/heritage/library/categories/natsec/bg1083.html">Will Clinton Pay the Price for America to Remain a Global Power,</a> by <a href="/heritage/staff/spring.htm">Baker Spring</a><p>
<i>Backgrounder</i> No. 1083, The Heritage Foundation<p>
Baker Spring, Senior Policy Analyst at The Heritage Foundation, writes that the Clinton Administration is underfunding its own proposed force structure for America's military by approximately $130 billion.  According to Spring, this coming shortfall will leave the United States with two options: 1) increase defense spending to match America's current level of international commitments; or 2) renege or partially withdraw from existing U.S. security commitments.  While opponents of defense spending have argued that with the Cold War over the U.S. no longer needs to have a defense budget three times the size of any other nation (as it currently does), Spring disagrees. He holds that the American military's distance from the areas to which it is committed and must project power, the high technology weaponry it uses in order to limit casualties, and its volunteer rather than conscription troops all demand higher levels of spending.  Spring also argues that reneging on security commitments could open the door to a host of international conflicts that a down-sized U.S. military could not deal with. In order to resolve the funding shortage, Spring calls for a large scale debate in Congress to alert the American people to the problem and ultimately lead the U.S. to be capable of meeting its global security commitments. 11 pp.  CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a><p>

<i>F.Y.I.</i>  No. 104, The Heritage Foundation<p>
Ariel Cohen, Senior Policy Analyst for The Heritage Foundation, outlines a report written by advisors of Communist Party Leader and former Russian presidential candidate Gennady Zyuganov. The authors of the report, proponents of hard-line communist doctrine and advocates of more aggressive military posturing, make a number of suggestions which, if adhered to, could prove profoundly disturbing for the United States. Such possibilities include: 1) Russia adopting a nuclear deterrence posture for perceived non-nuclear threats; 2) maintaining the conception of the U.S. and NATO as Russia's enemies.; 3) reorganizing Russia's military into a series of smaller but highly mobile units; and 4) preparing to reconquer by force the New Independent States of the former Soviet Union. Cohen cautions that regardless of the election's outcome, the views expressed in the report reflect those of many highly placed officials in Russia's government and military and could influence policy in the years to come. 11pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a>

<a href="/heritage/library/categories/trade/asc141.html">Why Renewing MFN for China Serves U.S. Interests,</a> by <a href="/heritage/staff/yates.html">Stephen J. Yates</a><p>
<i>Asian Studies Center Backgrounder</i> No. 141, The Heritage Foundation<p>
Stephen J. Yates, Policy Analyst for the Heritage Foundation's Asian Studies Center, contends that revoking China's Most Favored Nation trading status would be directly contrary to the United States' interests in Asia.  China's human rights abuses, weapons proliferation, and a host of other problems have prompted many in Congress to call for the denial of MFN to China. But Yates argues that  such a revocation is not in accordance with either the MFN's historical or contemporary purpose. MFN, rather than being the extension of special trading privileges, is more aptly described as the normal trading status.  According to Yates, the termination of normal trade relations with China would have serious consequences. Rather than revoke MFN, Yates outlines a policy which he holds to be more consistent and cohesive than that carried out so far by President Clinton. This policy, whose aim is to promote both democracy and improved U.S. Chinese relations, includes: 1) renewing China's MFN status; 2) inviting China's president to the White House for a full state visit; 3) following a more broad-based strategy towards Asia; 4) using policy tools better suited to the problem; and 5) repealing or amending the Jackson-Vanik amendment. 12pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a>

<i>Lecture</i> No. 566, The Heritage Foundation<p>
Barbara Hackman Franklin, former Secretary of Commerce examines the relationship between the United States and China in light of China's growing economic, geographic and military importance.  Despite China's increasing commitment to free market principles, Franklin sees human rights, trade deficits, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and intellectual property rights as obstacles to improving ties between the two countries. Even with these difficulties, however, Franklin believes the U.S. must continue to strengthen its relationship with China. Only by doing so can the U.S. help to strengthen the democratic and free market ideas currently gaining strength in China. She argues that the current U.S. policy lacks consistency and direction. Her remedy for this problem is the adoption of a strategic framework, outlining the goals, objectives, and expectations for the United States' relationship with China.  Included in this framework would be actions such as granting China permanent Most Favored Nation status and bringing the country into the World Trade Organization.  Franklin concludes by asserting that only by strengthening its economic and political ties with China, can the U.S. help direct the course China will take in the years to come. 9 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org</a>

<i>Lecture</i> No. 562, The Heritage Foundation<p>
United States Senator Jesse Helms calls for a shift in America's policy towards Asian nations, condemning the Clinton Administration for its indecisiveness and lack of priorities.  Helms believes continued support for political and economic freedom should be first on America's Asian agenda.  He asserts that the U.S. must use a firmer hand in dealing with the People's Republic of China, refusing to tolerate China's flagrant abuses of human rights and the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.  Helms also argues that the U.S. must encourage Japan to take a leadership role in the international community commensurate with its economic standing. Facilitating dialogues between North and South Korea, and India and Pakistan figure significantly in Helm's agenda for U.S.-Asian relations. Finally, Helms cautions that the U.S. must pay close attention to Russia's dealings with Asian nations and work closely with states in ASEAN in order to promote democracy in Vietnam, Burma, and Laos.  According to Helms, the U.S. must adopt a more cohesive Asian policy if it is to be prepared for the emergence of Asia as the focal point of political and economic power in the near future. 20pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org</a>.

<b>Terrorism: The Failed Response,</b> by Geoffrey Lee Williams and Alan Lee Williams<p>
<i>Occasional Paper</i> No. 66, Institute for European Defense and Strategic Studies<p>
Geoffrey Lee Williams, Professor of International Relations at the University of Cambridge, and Alan Lee Williams, Director of the Atlantic Council of the United Kingdom, argue that although the power to terrorize with weapons and violence as a means to an end has a very long tradition, modern terrorists are distinguished from their predecessors by an adherence to ideology. Marx, Lenin, and Mao all considered violence to be useful only as an instrument for the advancement of the revolution. However, they were wary of the use of terror because the shedding of innocent blood could alienate "the masses." The authors also offer definitions in order to provide distinction between the various terms and euphemisms for terrorists. In addition, they encourage governments to cooperate in order to avoid further violence. 55pp.  CONTACT.

<b>Privatization 1996,</b> edited by John O'Leary<p>
<i>Tenth Annual Report on Privatization</i>, Reason Foundation<p>
In this annual report, the Reason Foundation provides a comprehensive account of privatization of government assets, enterprises, and public services. The first section focuses on trends towards privatization in the public sector at the federal, state and local levels. The next area of analysis examines the politics of privatization, looking especially at the experiences of Indianapolis Mayor Stephen Goldsmith and New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman. Then, the report examines tools which will enable the government to understand the trends of activity based costing, contract monitoring techniques, and the use of competition within government.  This year's survey also covers contracting trends such as education privatization, solid waste management, and emergency medical services.  The final section of analysis looks at infrastructure trends, examining how industries as diverse as air traffic control, electric power, and corrections facilities are making the transition towards privatization.  68pp.  CONTACT: Reason Foundation, 3415 S.

<p><b>Designing Comprehensive Privatization Programs for Cities: Pittsburgh,</b> by John Stainbeck and Paul Kengor<p>
<i>Allegheny Institute Report</i> No. 96-14, Allegheny Institute and Reason Foundation<p>
John Stainback, President and CEO of Privatization for America, and Paul Kengor, Research Fellow for the Allegheny Institute, examine the challenges faced by city governments struggling with falling revenues and rising expenditures. Their solution centers around a comprehensive city-wide privatization program. The program involves nine different types of privatization for a city's assets, services, facility operations, debt, and infrastructure. The plan relies on government involvement in the creation and implementation of the privatization process. In an attempt to strengthen their governing ability and improve the quality of services provided to their citizens, city officials work to determine the types of privatization their situation demands, the level of control they want to maintain, and the assets they are willing to put into play.  Stainback and Kengor caution that while some risks do exist, they are still far outweighed by the benefits comprehensive privatization holds. These include: 1) reduced government costs; 2) generation of non-tax revenue; and 3) improved capabilities of developing and financing infrastructure. 46pp.  CONTACT: Allegheny Institute for Public Policy, Suite 612, 7 Parkway Center, Pittsburgh, PA 15220-3703, 412/937-4526, fax 412/928-1501

<b>Power Struggle</b>, by Kerry Jackson<p>
<i>FYI</i> May 8, 1996, American Legislative Exchange Council<p>
Kerry Jackson, Editor of <i>FYI</i>, examines the current move towards deregulating the electric power industry.  According to Jackson, while some consumer groups and utility companies have reservations about opening up the electric power market to competition, the move toward deregulation grows stronger everyday, particularly among industry insiders. As Jackson points out, legislators in approximately 30 states are devising legislation that would provide the best service to consumers, but in a low-cost, competitive market. ALEC is addressing the issue with its Energy, Environment, Natural Resources, and Agriculture Task Force. Jackson concludes that competition within the electric power industry will lower costs for consumers and offer them the best form of consumer protection possible. 4pp.  CONTACT: American Legislative Exchange Council, 910 17th Street, N.W., 5th floor, Washington, DC  20006, 202/466-3800, fax 202/466-3801.

<b>Reinventing Air Traffic Control: A New Blueprint for a Better System,</b> by Robert Poole and Viggo Butler<p>
<i>Policy Study</i> No. 206, Reason Foundation<p>
Robert Poole, President of Reason Foundation, and Viggo Butler, Chairman of United Airports Limited, Inc., assert that the Federal Aviation Administration: possesses a bureaucratic subculture; is subject to external micromanagement; and suffers from conflicts of interest between safety regulation and air traffic control operation.  In order to solve this problem, they set forth a plan by which a system of user fees would replace the current airline ticket tax and general aviation fuel tax. The authors believe that doing so would cure many of the FAA's structural weaknesses, leading to improved air safety, fewer flight delays, and shrunken operating costs. The new fee structure would be determined by aircraft weight and distance flown, and would exempt smaller, private aircrafts from most fees and taxes. To determine the fee structure, Poole and Butler recommend the development of a new user-controlled, not-for-profit Air Traffic Control corporation. Modeled after the ATC board which will soon assume control of Canada's air traffic control, the board would be set up and controlled by the government, air traffic controllers, airlines, and business aircraft owners. The new ATC system would be funded entirely by user fees and would be subject to arms length regulation by the FAA. Poole and Butler conclude that if the United States follows the example of not only Canada, but also Germany, Britain, and Switzerland, the fundamental problems of the system can be solved.19pp  CONTACT: Reason Foundation, 3415 S.

<a href="/heritage/library/categories/regulation/bg1085.html">Senator Pressler's Bold Proposal for Spectrum Freedom,</a> by <a href="/heritage/staff/thierer.htm">Adam D. Thierer</a><p>
<i>Backgrounder</i> No. 1085, The Heritage Foundation<p>
Adam D. Thierer, Alex C. Walker Fellow in Economic Policy at The Heritage Foundation, examines Senator Larry Pressler's staff discussion draft intended to enforce a complete overhaul of the United States' wireless spectrum regulatory policy. Thierer asserts that the Senator's reform proposal is badly needed because the current system suffers from a host of problems, including a resistance to change and a lack of respect for First Amendment rights. According to Thierer, Pressler's plan would: 1) provide spectrum flexibility; 2) expand and make permanent the auction and allocation process; 3) create a second broadcast spectrum solution; 4) prohibit FCC spectrum standard-setting or construction mandates; 5) demand release of more publicly held spectrum; 6) transfer all spectrum responsibilities from the National Telecommunications and Information Administration to the FCC and block grant public safety spectrum to the states; and 7) require a spectrum report to monitor progress. While Thierer, on the whole, endorses Pressler's proposal, he lists four changes which he believes would improve upon the initial plan. These include: holding outright, unambiguous auctions for all spectrum uses and users;  ending "public interest standard" regulation and guaranteeing equal First Amendment protections for all media, whether print or electronic; ending protectionist policies in spectrum technologies; and  de-licensing the entire spectrum. 11 pp.  CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a>

<b>A Free Market Solution to Groundwater Allocation in Georgia,</b> by Terry L. Anderson and Pamela S. Snyder<p>
<i>Issue Analysis,</i> Georgia Public Policy Foundation<p>
Terry Anderson, Executive Director of Political Economy Research Center (PERC), and Pamela Snyder, a PERC Research Assistant with, discuss the overuse of the Floridian aquifer system by groundwater pumpers in Georgia. Anderson and Snyder write that the state's use of regulation to reverse overdraft of the aquifer is not being welcomed with open arms, but, in the absence of well-defined property rights to groundwater, water users "race to the pumphouse" to capture their share of the resources before someone else does. The authors offer a market-based alternative to proposed government regulation, calling for privatization of the Floridian aquifer system in Georgia on a regional basis by defining quantified groundwater rights and allowing their transfer among users. 20 pp.  CONTACT: Georgia Public Policy Foundation, 2900 Chamblee-Tucker Road, Building Six, Atlanta, GA 30341-4128, 770/455-7600, fax 770/455-4355.

<b>California's Fiscal Condition,</b> by Tom McClintock<p>
<i>Briefings</i> No. 1996-51, Claremont Institute<p>
Tom McClintock, Director of Economic and Regulatory Affairs at the Claremont Institute's Golden State Center for Policy Studies, writes that, despite some positive signs, the California economy is still not stable. Attributing California's recession in the early 1990s to dramatic tax increases, McClintock points to a growing state debt, deferral of pension loans, and several bookkeeping anomalies as key indicators of impending economic difficulties. With these economic weaknesses, he holds that California is ill-repared to deal with its crumbling infrastructure. Noting that while spending per capita had increased significantly over the past twenty years, California is now providing fewer-and poorer-quality services to its citizens. Based upon this, McClintock concludes that California's problems stem not from how much revenue the state is receiving but rather how that revenue is spent. To remedy this problem, McClintock suggests two fundamental shifts in how California's policy makers allocate the budget: 1) restoring the state's constitutional restraints requiring a balanced budget, prohibiting borrowing, and limiting spending growth; and 2) downsizing the state bureaucracy and incorporating more competitive, free market oriented principles into the provision of goods and services. 9pp.  CONTACT: The Claremont Institute, 250 West First Street, Suite 330, Claremont, CA 91711, 909/621-6825, fax 909/626-8724, e-mail <a href="mailto: 2026935@mcimail.com">2026935@mcimail.com</a>, Internet <a href="http://www.claremont.org">http://www.claremont.org.</a><p>

<b>Small Business Survival Index: Ranking the Environment for Entrepreneurship Across the Nation,</b> by Raymond J. Keating<p>
Small Business Survival Foundation<p>
Raymond J. Keating, Chief Economist for the Small Business Foundation, examines the impact of a variety of taxes on small businesses on a state by state basis.  Asserting that how a government manages issues of investment and entrepreneurship is a vital economic matter, he concludes that high taxes and burdensome regulations will significantly reduce incentives for entrepreneurs to engage in high risk ventures. The end result of this process, according to Keating, is the restraint and diminishment of economic growth.  In order to provide both entrepreneurs and legislators with a more comprehensive understanding of the comparative degree to which their state promotes investment and growth, Keating ranks and measures some of the major costs imposed on entrpreneurship, investment, and businesses in each state.The Index surveys nine major government related costs imposed on small businesses and entrepreneurs. The taxes compared include: personal income taxes; capital gains taxes; corporate income taxes; property taxes; sales taxes; and death taxes. The survey also looks at the impact of unemployment tax rates, workers' compensation costs, and the total crime rate on small businesses.  Using these nine factors to shape his analysis, Keating summarizes the climate of each state for investment and small business opportunities.  13pp.  CONTACT.

According to Cameron, employees are protected from such situations by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The report also covers what litigants should expect from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and examines the role the First Amendment, federal labor laws, and compulsory union fees could play in such a situation.

<b>Social Security: Facing the Facts,</b> by Mark Weinberger<p>
<i>Project on Social Security Privatization</i> No. 3, Cato Institute<p>
Mark Weinberger, a partner in the law firm Washington Council, P.C., singles out Congress for their failure to address Social Security reform in the midst of the budget debate. Weinberger shows that the Social Security program could begin going bankrupt as early as 2113. He attributes this problem to the combined impact of the "graying of America," combined with increased costs and higher standards of living. To remedy this situation, Weinberger asserts lawmakers have four options: 1) reduce benefit payments; 2) increase the program's funding; 3) run up the federal debt; or 4) restructure the program so that people can save money in private accounts yielding higher returns. It is the fourth option, Weinberg endorses, concluding that it has the best potential for averting a potential crisis. 10pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC 20001, 202/842-0200, fax 202/842-3490, e-mail <a href="mailto: cato@cato.org">cato@cato.org</a>, Internet <a href="http://www.cato.org">http://www.cato.org.</a><p>

During his tenure from 1978-1980 he oversaw the privatization of the Chilean pension system. In this paper, Piera discusses the international trend of bankrupt pension systems, how he successfully privatized the Chilean pension system, and how the new Chilean system has increased the productivity of capital and thus the rate of economic growth in its economy.

<b>Private Means, Public Ends: Volunteerism vs. Coercion,</b> edited by J. Wilson Mixon, Jr.<p>
Foundation for Economic Education, Inc.<p>
This collection of twenty-six essays, Edited by J. Wilson Mixon, Jr., Professor of Economics at Berry College, challenges the assumption that the government is the best institution to provide basic services such as policing, a transportation infrastructure, and education.  In his introduction, Mixon argues that while the trend towards privatization is gaining support, most people still endorse government involvement in activities as diverse as mail delivery and banking.  But it is because of the government's long standing involvement in these services, Mixon asserts, people have forgotten that private initiatives are also capable of meeting society's many needs.  In fact, as one essay, authored by Henry Hazlitt, concludes, private, voluntary means are actually more effective in serving the community than forced government initiatives.  Other selected essays by Barbara Dodsworth, William R. Allen, and William Dickneider focus on the relationship of government funding and art.  Clint Bolick and Raymond J. Keating write against regulation of the communications industry, while Hannah Lapp and Scott Payne make the case for increased privatization of education.  The revitalization of private charity rather than public welfare is discussed by authors including Gerald Wisz, Robert Peterson, and David T. Beito.  Finally, the deregulation and privatization of banking, transportation, and law enforcement, are the focus of essays by Richard Syll, William B. Irvine, and Nicholas Elliott.    CONTACT.

<b>The Uncertain Hand: Hong Kong Taxis and Tenders,</b> by Christopher D. Hall<p>
Hong Kong Center for Economic Research<p>
The history of taxi regulation in Hong Kong shows that the uncertain regulation is the major source of risk in that business, according to Christopher Hall, Senior Lecturer in the School of Economics and Finance at the University of Hong Kong. After World War II, the taxi business in Hong Kong was basically a cartel of more expensive brand name operators controlled by the police as if it were a private enterprise with public monopoly rights. By the mid-1960s the burgeoning transport-bureaucracy introduced public auctions to allocate licences and, in effect, stripped the police of their power to control the business. The illegal taxi trade grew soon after. In 1985, the current de facto arrangement came about in which licence holders have gradually gained control of the taxi business. Hall argues that the taxi business would be a safe investment if regulation change, real and suggested, did not create so much uncertainty. 266 pp.  CONTACT: Hong Kong Center for Economic Research, School of Economics, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam Road, Hong Kong, 852/2547-8313, fax 852/2548-6319

<a href="/heritage/library/categories/regulation/tp14.html">Creating a Financial Services Industry for the 21st Century Part One: Tear Down the Walls,</a> by <a href="/heritage/staff/barry.html">John S. Barry</a><p>
<i>Heritage Talking Points</i> The Heritage Foundation<p>
John S. Barry, Policy Analyst at The Heritage Foundation, condemns the current financial regulatory system which mandates the forced separation of financial services.  According to Barry, historically barriers were created between commercial and investment banking because of fears of high risk losses and conflicts of interest. But he argues that these fears are groundless, that in fact banks engaging in investment activities are less likely to fail than those that did not. He also asserts that integrated banks are less likely to succumb to conflicts of interest than purely commercial or investment banks. Having addressed the major arguments against bank integration, Barry outlines the following plan for modernizing America's financial services industry: 1) repealing the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956; 2) repealing the Banking Act of 1933; 3) eliminating federal regulatory barriers to integrated financial service provision; and 4) allowing commercial companies to offer financial services such as individual savings and checking accounts, consumer lines of credit, and diversified investment services. Barry holds that the implementation of these suggestions will benefit both American businesses and consumers, providing them with more profitable investment opportunities, easier access to capital, reduced costs, and a more stable financial services sector. 17pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a>

<i>F.Y.I.</i> No. 102, The Heritage Foundation<p>
Mark Wilson, Rebecca Lukens Fellow in Labor Policy at The Heritage Foundation, and Angela Antonelli, Heritage Deputy Director for Economic Policy, illustrate that the real problem behind workers' declining take-home pay is not a low minimum wage, but rather the hidden costs of government mandates, taxes, and regulations. According to Wilson and Antonelli, government mandated benefits, ranging from unemployment insurance to workers compensation, dramatically increase the cost to employers to hire and keep workers on their payrolls. They also point out that growing numbers of government regulations increase the cost of employing workers and in the long-run drive down productivity, further escalating costs. Wilson and Antonelli assert that if Congress truly wants to increase wages and job opportunities for American workers they should not raise the minimum wage. Rather, they should focus on reducing the costs of employing workers by cutting payroll taxes; cutting the capital gains tax; enacting significant regulatory reform; and increasing the skills of the workforce. 10pp.  CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a>

<b>How Corporate Welfare Won: Clinton and Congress Retreat from Cutting Business Subsidies,</b> by Stephen Moore and Dean Stansel<p>
<i>Policy Analysis</i> No. 254, Cato Institute<p> 
Stephen Moore, Director of Fiscal Policy Studies at the Cato Institute, and Dean Stansel, Cato Fiscal Policy analyst, demonstrate that the federal government currently spends $75 billion a year on direct subsidies to business. Despite that last year both Congress and the Clinton Adminstration pledged to attack this pervasive corporate safety net, the study finds that those promises have been largely unfulfilled. The study reveals that many corporate subsidy programs were reduced minimally, or not at all. In addition, the Clinton Administration has shown itself hostile to even the modest corporate welfare cutbacks proposed by Congress. In fact, the Administration's 1996 budget actually requested a slight increase in spending. The report concludes that an unwillingness to reduce the corporate social safety net undermines the rest of the government downsizing agenda. 29pp.  CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC  20001, 202/842-0200, fax 202/842-3490, e-mail <a href="mailto: cato@cato.org">cato@cato.org</a>, Internet <a href="http://www.cato.org">http://www.cato.org.</a><p>


<b>Georgia Jobs Tax Credits: Needed Incentives or Needless Subsidies?</b> by Dr. Steve Morse<p>
<i>Issue Analysis,</i> Georgia Public Policy Foundation<p>
Dr. Steve Morris, a member of the Academic Advisory Board at the Georgia Center for Public Policy, argues that tax incentives passed in Georgia in 1994 to attract business were unnecessary and fail to address the real needs of Georgia's businesses. According to Morse, while such actions sound good in theory, in reality they have been proven to do little to affect a state's overall economic development. He bases his arguments on over thirty years of studies showing that most tax incentive programs simply give unnecessary tax incentives to businesses to do what they would have done anyway. Morse believes that if Georgia wishes to remain economically competitive in the coming years, it must abandon its current agenda of unnecessary tax incentives and adopt a policy which  focuses on factors businesses find truly important when making location decisions.  These factors include: 1) the availability of an educated and trainable workforce; 2) low taxes; 3) a high quality of life; 4) first-class research and development facilities; and 5) non-burdensome regulations. 9pp.  CONTACT: Georgia Public Policy Foundation, 2900 Chamblee-Tucker Road, Building Six, Atlanta, GA 30341-4128, 770/455-7600, fax 770/455-4355.

<b>How Title XI Ship Subsidies Sink the Taxpayer,</b> by John S. Tottie<p>
<i>Issue Analysis</i> No. 28, Citizens for a Sound Economy<p>
John S. Tottie, a Policy Analyst at Citizens for a Sound Economy, argues that the 60 year old Title XI Federal Ship Financing Guarantee Program, which guarantees loans for a wide variety of vessels and shipyard modernization projects, has accumulated $1 billion in loan defaults. Tottie posits that the case against Title XI is the case against entrenched political pork. Because the Title XI loans have a "subsidy value" and the resources available for investment are not unlimited, the government's favoritism of the shipbuilding industry also means that other goods and services that consumers want will be less plentiful. Tottie continues that any defense of Title XI must explain why the government, and not the American people, should decide how scarce economic resources are to be allocated. In conclusion, Tottie believes Title XI should be repealed. 16pp.  CONTACT: Citizens for a Sound Economy, 1250 H Street, N.W., Suite 700, Washington, DC 20005-3908, 202/783-3870, fax 202/783-4687, Internet <a href="http://www.cse.org/cse">http://www.cse.org/cse.</a>

<b>White House Tax Theories,</b> by Alan Reynolds<p>

Alan Reynolds, Director of Economic Research at Hudson Institute, critically anaylzes <I>The President's Council of Economic Adviser's 1996 Economic Report</i> assertion that changing tax rates have had no discernable effect on work effort, productivity, savings and economic growth. Reynolds debunks the myths presented by the CEA report which declares that the reduction of tax rates in the early 1980s was responsible for the large budget deficits that have persisted since. The Economic Report also states that whereas the impact of tax policy on savings is ambiguous, the ability of decreasing fedeal budget deficits to increase national savings is perfectly clear. Reynolds argues that the report does not bolster its finding with facts, and dismisses inconvenient truths as though they have become politically incorrect, in effect asking Americans to disregard scientific method in favor of naked politics and raw emotion. 16pp.  CONTACT: Hudson Institute, Herman Kahn Center, P.O.

<i>Backgrounder</i> No. 1084. The Heritage Foundation<p>
Robert Rector, Senior Policy Analyst at The Heritage Foundation, dispels some of the myths and misconceptions associated with welfare and children. He argues that children are suffering simply because the U.S. welfare system has failed. Furthermore, the system has failed because the ideas upon which it was founded are flawed. Rector writes that flawed assumptions that children in families with higher income do better in life, and that welfare can easily raise family income, amount to the false conclusion that welfare is good for children. Rather, Rector points out, welfare has detrimental effects on cognitive capabilities, negatively effects the long term employment and earning capacity of young boys, and promotes illegitimacy. Rector concludes that those truly concerned with the welfare of children must seek a radical transformation of the welfare system aimed not at increasing welfare spending and enrollment, but at reducing dependency and illegitimacy. 14pp.  CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a><p>

<b>Unintended Consequences: How Government Policies Hurt Oregon's Poor,</b> by Martin L. Buchanan<p>
<i>Fiscal Insight</i> No. 12, Cascade Policy Institute<p>
Martin Buchanan, Policy Analyist for the Cascade Policy Institute, argues that government policy at many levels is actually hurting Oregon's poor families in four ways. In order to escape poverty, families or individuals must surmount four barriers which Buchanan likens to four Berlin Walls. These barriers consist of taxes on the poor, obstacles to employment and enterprise, forced purchases of certain services, and higher prices for the poor. The paper also recommends several government actions to help poor Oregonians at the federal, state and local levels. Buchanan believes that the interests of the poor align well with the general interest and if these burdens are lifted from the poor, the burdens will lighten for all. 12pp.  CONTACT: Cascade Policy Institute, 813 S.W.

<i>Backgrounder</i> No. 1081, The Heritage Foundation<p>
Ronald Utt, Visiting Fellow at The Heritage Foundation, reports on Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry Cisneros's plan to introduce the benefits of market competition into the public housing industry despite efforts to hinder the plan by an alliance of moderate Republicans and liberal Democrats. However, with the support of House reformers and leaders, in conjunction with bold intervention by the federal courts, Utt believes, there is a good chance that these needed reforms in America's New Deal housing policies will survive the lobbying efforts of a public housing industry determined to preserve its costly taxpayer-supported monopoly over housing for the poor. Utt argues that this clash over housing reform is far more than a dispute over spending levels. Rather, the dispute concerns how government should help the poor. 13pp.  CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a><p>

<b>The Value of Welfare: Cato vs. CBPP,</b> by Michael Tanner and Naomi Lopez<p>
<i>Briefing Papers</i> No. 27, Cato Institute<p>
Michael Tanner and Naomi Lopez of the Cato Institute reviewed the Center on Budget and Policy Priority's critique of the Cato study comparing the benefits available from entitlement programs with income available from work. Tanner and Lopez maintain that a review of the original study published by Cato and the criticisms in the CBPP study reveals that the Cato study remains an accurate appraisal of the level of welfare benefits. The study, by Tanner and Lopez, states that the CBPP report fails to account for the values of non-cash welfare benefits such as Medicaid. In addition, the Cato study's inclusion of housing benefits more accurately reflects the work vs. welfare tradeoff for long term welfare recipients. Turner and Lopez conclude that with the exception of a small error in the calculation of the values of food stamps in five states, the criticisms of the Cato study are unfounded. 29pp.  CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC  20001, 202/842-0200, fax 202/842-3490, e-mail <a href="mailto: cato@cato.org">cato@cato.org</a>, Internet <a href="http://www.cato.org">http://www.cato.org.</a><p>

<b>Replacing Welfare in Wisconsin,</b> by Andrew Bush<p>
<i>Hudson Briefing Paper</i> No. 192, Hudson Institute<p>
Andrew Busch, Assistant Professor of Political Science at The University of Denver, examines Wisconsin's new welfare reform program. This new program, "Wisconsin Works" (W-2), is a work-based system which tries to help parents establish their own means of long-term support, primarily through work. The focus of W-2 will be with its financial and employment planners (FEP's), who will help families plan and execute employment strategies. The idea behind W-2 is that consistent employment is the way out of poverty, and finding a job for unemployed parents is only the beginning of the process-showing them how to keep a job is the real aim. 8pp. CONTACT: Hudson Institute, Herman Kahn Center, P.O.

<b>A Working Solution to the Welfare Crisis: The Full Employment Model of Welfare Reform,</b> by Peter S. Barwick<p>
Commonwealth Foundation<p>
Peter S. Barwick, Research Associate for The Commonwealth Foundation, posits that thirty years after the inauguration of the Great Society, it is clear that the welfare state has failed to deliver on its promise to end poverty. In fact, there is now a broad consensus that welfare programs have contributed substantially, if unintentionally, to a worsening of the plight of the poor by undermining the two-parent family and a commitment to work. Barwick presents the Full Employment Model as a promising and fully developed proposal for reforming the current welfare system. The merits of the reforms are detailed and the improvements of the current system are underscored. Advantages cited by Barwick include an end to welfare as an entitlement and the provision of practical work experience. However, Barwick acknowledges and explores important questions raised by the Full Employment Model such as the cost and the role of the bureaucracy. 12pp.  CONTACT: The Commonwealth Foundation for Public Policy Alternatives, 3544 North Progress Avenue, Suite 101, Harrisburg, PA  17110, 717/671-1901, fax 717/671-1905.

Patrick Fagan, William H.G. Fitzgerald Senior Fellow in Family and Cultural Issues at The Heritage Foundation, discusses the issues involved in the Adoption and Stability Act of 1996, sponsored by Representative Susan Molinari. Fagan notes that the key component of the bill is a $5,000 tax credit to encourage adoption. Fagan presents the need for adoption as well as the reasons that adoption should be encouraged. Also, Fagan addresses the numerous barriers to adoption including misuse of the Foster Care system and the race of the child and adoptive parents. The plight of black children is specifically addressed in light of the obstacles to inter-racial adoptions.

<b>Challenging America's Inverted Health Priorities,</b> by Elizabeth M. Whelan<p>
<i>Priorities</i> Vol. 8 No. 1, American Council on Science and Health<p>
This speech by Elizabeth M. Whelan, President of the American Council on Science and Health (ACSH), relates that her top priority at ACSH involves helping Americans distinguish between real and hypothetical health risks, and to separate the leading causes of disease and death from the leading causes of unnecessary anxiety. She argues that the purpose of public health measures, whether carried out at EPA, the FDA, in Congress, or in the private sector, should be the prevention of premature disease and death. She rejects the notion that public health efforts should have hidden goals which might include harassing industy, alarming people about nonrisks, banning useful, subtances or advancing other social and political agendas. Whelan posits that the nation's health priorities are inverted because health issues are pushed to center stage, squandering limited public health resources. Examples include the mother who worries about the alleged carcinogin Alar in applesauce, but fails to buckle her child into a car. She suggests that the influential factors creating inverted health policies include the enormous political and economic clout of the manufacturers of the leading cause of preventable death, cigarettes ,and the contamination of the public health profession by an ideologically fueled form of political correctness that chills open dialouge. 10pp.  CONTACT.

<b>Health Risk Reporting: Getting the Story Straight,</b> by Courtney LaFountain<p>
<i>Contemporary Issues Series</i> No. 78, Center for the Study of American Business<p>
Courtney LaFountain, Environmental Researcher at the Center for the Study of American Business, offers nine fundamental questions that readers should ask when evaluating a story about a new risk. LaFountain's concern focuses on press coverage of studies of three possible environmental health risks to show that many of these points are not addressed in media coverage of risk-based research. The author suggests that journalists have a tendency to report the political or human interest side of a risk, rather than the technical or scientific side. Her nine point plan for the analysis of information involves inquiries which are directed toward correcting false information and disclosing the whole story on partial reporting. Cases she applies her nine point plan to include the major news coverage of the Savitz-Loomis Study, the Long Island Breast Cancer Study and the Greenpeace Chlorine Study. 24pp. CONTACT: Center for the Study of American Business, Washington University, Campus Box 1208, St. Louis, MO 63130-4899, 314/935-5630, fax 314/935-5688.

<b>FDA Reform, Take One: Chairman Kassebaum's Bill,</b> by Michael F. Cannon<p>
<i>Issue Analysis </I>No. 27, Citizens for a Sound Economy<p>
Michael F. Cannon, Health Care Policy Analyst at Citizens for a Sound Economy, discusses Nancy Kassebaum's Food and Drug Administration Performance and Accountability Act of 1996. Cannon believes the proposal addresses the FDA's obstruction of doctors' and patients' efforts to obtain badly needed treatments, the rise in health care costs, and violations of the First Amendment. These proposals include such measures as refocusing the FDA's mission and balancing the agency's safety and efficacy standards against the needs of the seriously ill. The bill would also allow FDA accredited private firms to review product applications on behalf of the agency and would shorten the time it takes to bring drugs, medical devices and biologics to market, where they may help patients. Though not without shortcomings and with several provisions yet to be added to the bill, Cannon believes the Kassebaum Bill will enable doctors and patients to obtain new treatments faster, and at a lower cost, than under the current regulatory regime-without compromising patient safety. 9pp.  CONTACT: Citizens for a Sound Economy, 1250 H Street, N.W., Suite 700, Washington, DC 20005-3908, 202/783-3870, fax 202/783-4687, Internet <a href="http://www.cse.org/cse">http://www.cse.org/cse.</a><p>

<b>Medical Savings Accounts: The Singapore Experience,</b> by Thomas A. Massaro and Yu-Ning Wong<p>
<i>NCPA Policy Report</i> No. 203, National Center for Policy Analysis<p>
Thomas Massaro, Harrison Foundation Professor of Medicine and Law, analyzes Medical Savings Accounts in Singapore and has revealed a system which offers individuals access to care while holding down costs. According to the study, the island city-state spends only 3.1 percent of its gross domestic product on health care, lower than other Asian nations and well below the United States at 154 percent. In addition, Singaporeans have access to the most modern technology, including CAT scans, bypass surgery and organ transplants. Moreover, there is very little waiting in Singapore, either to see a doctor or to obtain high technology services. Massaro argues that the fact that people are spending their own money, rather than a third party insurer, has helped to curtail Singapore's health care costs. Also, because people are free to exercise choice in the medical marketplace, providers of care have strong incentives to maintain quality. The study concludes that if Medical Savings Accounts were available in the United States, prudent buying would begin to chip away at the high price of care and might significantly reduce it. 19pp.  CONTACT: National Center for Policy Analysis, 12655 N.

<b>Immigration and America's Cities: A Sign of Economic Health,</b> by Stephen Moore<p>

Stephen Moore, Visiting Fellow at the Alexis de Tocqueville Insititution, argues against the overtures by Members of Congress and President Clinton to significantly reduce both legal and illiegal immigration on the basis that such a reduction is needed to stop the drain on cities and states facing heavy fiscal, social, economic and other "costs" of immigration. Moore's study of America's 85 largest cities, using Census data over a 15-year period, which demonstrates that high levels of immigration are generally associated with cities that have more positive economic indicators. The study finds that, compared to cities with the fewest immigrants, cities with the highest proportion of immigrants in 1990 had on average: 15% higher per capita incomes; 90% lower tax burdens; 130% higher job growth; 17% lower crime rates; and 17% lower poverty rates. 48pp. CONTACT: The Alexis de Tocqueville Institution, 1611 North Kent Street, Suite 901, Arlington, VA  22209, 703/351-4969, fax 703/351-0090.

<i>Issue Brief</i> No. 120, Alexis de Tocqueville Institution<p>
John  Berthoud, Vice President of the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution, relates that a review of contributions by the political action committee of the National Education Association reveals that the Congress that NEA is seeking to elect would radically change the direction of American government. Most significantly, NEA's ideal Congress would vastly expand federal spending and taxation. The average House candidate supported by the NEA during the last election cycle had an agenda to increase federal spending by $302 billion per year. On the other hand, the candidates that the NEA opposed had a net agenda to cut federal spending by $22.6 billion per year. Berthoud also states that, despite NEA's pledge of support for America's children, if NEA could have the Congress it wanted, it would mean either hundreds of billions of dollars in new taxes on American families or hundreds of billions of dollars in deficits for future generations. 7pp.  CONTACT: The Alexis de Tocqueville Institution, 1611 North Kent Street, Suite 901, Arlington, VA  22209, 703/351-4969, fax 703/351-0090.

<i>Committee Brief</i> No. 26, The Heritage Foundation<p>
Denis Doyle, Heritage Visiting Fellow in Education, argues that Congress has a historic opportunity to convert Title I, Education for the Disadvantaged, into a voucher program. He proposes that poor families, rather than bureaucrats, decide where their children will go to school. Doyle cites the widely recognized problems with Title I, including the adverse effect of the Supreme Court's Aguilar decision which actively discourages poor children from attending non-government schools by penalizing them if they do. Doyle concludes that in order to reform Title I, the program should be reconnecting to its true beneficiaries-students and not schools. As it is, Title I commits more than $1,000 to each eligible child and if that money were available as a Title I voucher it would permit children to select schools that best serve their needs. Such an approach, writes Doyle, would mitigate the effects of the school bureaucracy and begin to instill values which foster character development. 5pp.  CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a><p>

Joseph L. Bast, President of The Heartland Institute, Herbert J. Walberg of the University of Illinois at Chicago, and Robert J. Genetski of Chicago Capital, Inc., formulate a reply to the Governor's Commission on Education Funding and offer alternative principles for school finance reform. The report cites evidence which demonstrates why public schools are failing in Illinois, such as excessive bureaucracy and regulation. Moreover, the writers maintain that spending more money will not alleviate the situation. They argue that student achievement is not related to spending because increased spending rarely addresses the reasons schools are failing. The second part of the report offers a means to improve public schools through a market-based approach.

Jennifer A Marshall, Educational Policy Analyst for the Family Research Council, and Jennifer E. Marshall, Welfare Policy Analyst for the Family Research Council, survey the philosophical and historical background of public education. They assert that, given the failure to establish a full educational choice program anywhere in the U.S. after a quarter century, choice proponents must challenge themselves to develop a new scheme. The proposal should place a premium on liberty and on the private benefits of education while reformulating the public-purpose rhetoric employed by the education establishment. Marshall and Marshall also believe the new proposal should avoid the weaknesses associated with vouchers, including the menace of government regulation, consistent challenges to constitutionality, dim prospects for political passage, the danger of expanding an entitlement mentality and a narrow coalition of beneficiaries to support passage. The authors invest faith in a refundable tax credit scheme to overleap the hurdles presented by means tested voucher programs. 7pp.  CONTACT: Family Research Council, 700 13th Street, N.W., Suite 500, Washington, DC  20005, 202/393-2100, fax 202/393-2134, Internet <a href="http://www.frc.org">http://www.frc.org.</a>

Heritage Talking Points No. 15, The Heritage Foundation<p>
John Shanahan, Policy Analyst for The Heritage Foundation, argues that although the government has the power to confiscate private land, it must compensate the owner. However, when government regulates how private owners may use their land, it typically does so without any recognition of, or compensation for, the costs. Shanahan notes that this de facto taking of property-the practice of restricting a person's right to use his property without compensating him for losses caused by the restriction-is now being questioned. The author discusses House and Senate bills which would protect private property and contract rights. Shanahan also offers the philosophical groundwork concerning the importance of private property. Shanahan laments that although the Supreme Court has clearly sided with the Constitution when requiring the government to pay just compensation when any amount of land is confiscated, the Court's decisions regarding regulatory takings have been less clear. As a result, executive branch agencies have had wide latitude in taking property through regulation. 4pp.  CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a><p>

<b>Regulation vs. Conservation,</b> by Jonathan H. Adler<p>
<i>CEI Update </i>Vol. 9, No. 5, Competitive Enterprise Institute<p>
Jonathan Adler, Director of Environmental Studies at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, illustrates how regulation, the primary means that the federal government employs to protect endangered species and ecologically sensitive lands, might actually discourage voluntary stewardship and conservation of private property. He calls for non-regulatory, incentive based programs and compensation to maintain environmental standards. Forcing agencies to compensate for a regulation that constitutes a "taking" out of their own budget will cause them to examine whether the benefit of the regulatory action is worth the compensation. This way, according to Adler, "land-use regulation will only be pursued when the benefits appear to justify the costs or when other options are impractical or more costly." The coercive regulatory system that is presently used by the federal government costs the taxpayers approximately $300,000 per wetland acre protected. Adler argues that incentive-based programs would conserve wetlands at a fraction of the cost and would protect private property rights. 3pp.  CONTACT: Competitive Enterprise Institute, 1001 Connecticut Avenue, N.W., Suite 1250, Washington, DC 20036, 202/331-1010, fax 202/488-0806.

<b>Key Issues in Environmental Risk Comparisons: Removing Distortions and Insuring Fairness, </b>by George M. Gray<p>
<i>Policy Study </i>No. 205, Reason Foundation<p>
Dr. George Gray, Deputy Director and Regulatory Toxicologist at the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis, maintains that environmental risk management is crucial in order to ensure that scarce public health resources are used wisely. Risk assessment plays a key role in environmental decisions such as setting drinking water standards, Superfund site cleanup goals, and standards for pesticide residues on food. The Reason Foundation claims that risk assessment is associated with nearly all of the two percent of Gross National Product that is spent annually in the United States on environmental protection. Gray argues that many of the standard risk assessments use to establish regulatory standards deliberately overstate people's exposure to environmental contaminants. To best employ risk assessment to protect people, risk characterization must be improved to make better use of science in order to find the most accurate estimates, not "conservative" estimates. All risk comparisons, concludes Gray, require the best science and risk assessment to maximize protection of human health. 18pp.  CONTACT: Reason Foundation, 3415 S.

<b>A Positive Agenda for Environmental Policy, </b>by Bruce Yandle<p>
<i>The Shape of Things </i>No. 6, Progress & Freedom Foundation<p>
Bruce Yandle, Alumni Professor of Economic and Legal Studies at Clemson University, delivered the remarks in this paper at a Progress & Freedom Foundation roundtable on the environment. Yandle begins by mentioning that it has been nearly a quarter century since the United States and most of the industrialized world have been engaged in a massive effort to maintain environmental quality. He argues that the current "command-and-control" system is obsolete and that U.S. environmental polices need to be changed. An agenda for change would involve the following elements: <i>Goal Orientation</i>, policy should emphasize measuring, monitoring and reporting on environmental policy; <i>Flexibility,</i> innovation should be rewarded instead of penalized; <i>Biological Envelopes</i>, organizations such as river-basin, water-shed and air-shed associations should be encouraged and allowed to innovate in order to achieve goals; <i>Community Common Sense</i>, environmental protection decision making should take place where outcomes and costs matter the most; <i>Common Law,</i> statutory blocks against common law solutions to environmental problems should be removed; and <i>Property Rights</i>, private parties should be justly compensated for public benefits that they are asked to provide. Yandle concludes by arguing that the U.S. needs to update the blueprints for America's environmental policy-which have changed very little in twenty-five years.  4pp. CONTACT. Richard F.

It debunks four myths about self-audit privileges, reveals the flaws in the Environmental Protection Agency's policies and philosophies regarding the laws, and provides an update of legislation in the states. The authors examine-and then dismiss-arguments against self-audit laws, deeming them unfounded. The conclusion they reach is that the pervasive and voluminous regulation that has evolved over the years is inferior to a "model that focuses on and encourages voluntary compliance." Such a policy would allow regulatory agencies "to direct their limited enforcement resources at those among the regulated community that do not strive to be good citizens." 13 pp. CONTACT: American Legislative Exchange Council, 910 17th Street, N.W., 5th floor, Washington, DC  20006, 202/466-3800, fax 202/466-3801.

<b>Farming to Sustain the Environment, </b>by Dennis T. Avery and Alex Avery<p>
<i>Hudson Briefing Paper </i>No. 190, Hudson Institute<p>
Dennis Avery, Director of the Center for Global Food Issues, and Alex Avery, Research Associate at the Center for Global Food Issues, discuss the new urgency of global agricultural sustainability in light of population growth. They find that the primary challenge of future sustainability is conservation of forests and other wildlands and wild plant and animal species to ensure integrity of local ecosystems. They also find that ensuring adequate funding for agricultural research, as well as researching new ways to fight soil erosion around the world is a priority. Avery and Avery note that modern high yield farming practices improve their efficiency, safety and sensitivity to the environment in direct proportion to investment in new agricultural technology and research. 20pp.  CONTACT: Hudson Institute, Herman Kahn Center, P.O.

 <b>Marbury's Travail: Federalist Politics and William Marbury's Appointment as Justice of the Peace,</b> by David Forte<P>
<i>The Catholic University of America Law Review </i>Vol. 45, No. 2, The Columbus School of Law<p>
David Forte, Professor of Law at Cleveland State University, examines the Federalist politics behind William Marbury's appointment as Justice of the Peace in the last days of John Adam's presidency. Soon after his inauguration, Thomas Jefferson discovered the undelivered commisions of the previous president that included Marbury's, and immediately ordered them withheld. Forte shows how the ambition of Marbury, the son of an established, but impoverished, family, worked his way up to a position of power in the Maryland gentry. Marbury's political loyalty to the Adam's wing of the Federalist party in Maryland earned him a nomination as Justice of the Peace, "the most powerful office in the lives of the common people." Marbury's position amongst Adam's loyalists brought him Jefferson's enmity. It was Jefferson's refusal to allow Marbury to take office that lead to the landmark case <i>Marbury v. Madison</i>, that established judicial review, and sizably increased the power of the judicial branch of government. 53 pp. CONTACT: The Columbus School of Law, The Catholic University of America, 620 Michigan Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C., 202/319-5140.

<b>Gun Control: Is the Tide Turning, </b>by Austin Fulk<p>
<i>Organization Trends  </i>June 1996, Capital Research Center<p>
Austin Fulk, Research Associate at the Capital Research Center, examines the recent move in many states to allow individuals to carry loaded, concealed weapons. Fulk points out that as the federal government has been tightening gun control laws, anti-gun control organizations have been focusing their efforts at the state level. He points to approximately a dozen states where regulations regarding the carrying of concealed weapons have been relaxed. After debating the arguments against concealed weapons, and asserting that guns do not lead to increased violence, Fulk goes on to document the contributions of groups such as the National Rifle Association, Gun Owners of America, and the Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms. Next, he traces the rise of the gun control movement, detailing the work of groups such as Handgun Control, Inc., Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, and the Violence Policy Center. Fulk concludes by noting that while the federal government may soon assist proponents of concealed weapons by passing legislation allowing concealed weapons holders to carry guns across state lines, that help is not critical. Just as education and welfare reforms have been devolving to state levels, so too, he claims, has the issue of gun control. 7pp.  CONTACT: Capital Research Center, 727 15th Street, N.W., 8th Floor, Washington, DC 20005, 202/393-2600, fax 202/393-2626.

<b>Handbook on Religious Liberty Around the World, </b>edited by Pedro C. Moreno<p>
Rutherford Institute<p>
Edited by Pedro Moreno, International Coordinator for The Rutherford Institute, the <i>Handbook on Religious Liberty</i> examines the historical and legal aspects of religious liberty around the world.  In John W. Whitehead's forward, he argues that a type of religious apartheid-the exclusion of religious belief and persons from the public sphere-is occurring throughout the world, even in the United States.  To support this thesis, Moreno provides detailed accounts of instances of religious persecution throughout the world.  Attacks against Christians, Jews, and a variety of others are documented from a wide array of countries, including India, Sudan, Israel, China, Kenya, Australia, and Thailand.  Given special attention are the instances of religious persecution in the United States, where, The Rutherford Institute argues, religious beliefs, particularly Christianity, are being systematically eradicated. Knowing where religious discrimination is occurring and taking action to stop it are critical, according to Rutherford because: 1) where religious apartheid exists, persecution of individual believers inevitably follows; and 2) with the rise of secularism, the positive restraining effects of Judeo-Christian beliefs upon citizens will end.  347pp.  CONTACT.

<b>Discrimination, Affirmative Action, and Freedom: Sorting Out the Issues,</b> by Roger Pilon<p>
<i>American University Law Review,</i> Vol. 45, February 1996 <p>
Roger Pilon, Director of the Cato Institute's Center for Constitutional Studies, analyses the current debate over affirmative action from the perspective of First Principles. Arguing that individual liberty is grounded in the idea of individual sovereignty, he demonstrates how the breakdown of the distinction between private and public has led to the confusion that surrounds the anti-discrimination/affirmative action debate among both liberals and conservatives, with liberals trying to impose affirmative action in both the public and private sectors, conservatives trying to impose anti-discrimination in both sectors. Neither side seems to appreciate how the ideas of private and public sovereignty would sort the issues out in the respective sectors.

<b>A Court Without a Compass, </b>by Roger Pilon<p>
<i>New York Law School Law Review </i>Vol. 40, No. 4<p>
Roger Pilon, Director of the Cato Institute's Center for Constitutional Studies, argues in a symposium on James F. Simon's <i>The Center Holds: The Power Struggle Inside the Rehnquist Court,</i> that Simon presents a one-dimensional morality play of the last 40 years of Supreme Court jurisprudence. Concluding, correctly, that the Reagan/Bush appointees have shifted the Court only slightly, Simon's analysis, according to Pilon, nonetheless misses the deeper currents in 20th century jurisprudence that help explain why the Rehnquist Court is as political as the Warren and Burger Courts were and why constitutional law today has become so politisized. The Court today, Pilon concludes, is without a compass because its members, reflecting those currents, have no deeply grounded philosophy of the Constitution.

<b>Emancipating School Prayer: How to Use the State Constitution to Beat the ACLU and the Supreme Court,</b> edited by Harry V. Jaffa<p>
Claremont Institute<p>
Harry Jaffa, Professor Emeritus of Political Philosophy at Claremont McKenna College and a Distinguished Fellow at the Claremont Institute, argues that Congress has the constitutional authority to immediately pass legislation allowing voluntary prayer in schools. He adds that this prayer would be guided by the acknowledgment of God expressed in the preambles of 46 U.S. state constitutions. This would at once recall the idea of "liberty under God," and remind all Americans that acknowledging God has not been a danger to, but rather the formation of unparalleled freedom for two centuries. Further, he argues that a joint resolution of Congress would preclude the Supreme Court from acting in opposition without declaring all 46 state constitutions unconstitutional. 49pp.  CONTACT: The Claremont Institute, 250 West First Street, Suite 330, Claremont, CA 91711, 909/621-6825, fax 909/626-8724, E-mail <a href="mailto: 2026935@mcimail.com">2026935@mcimail.com,</a> Internet <a href=" http://www.claremont.org">	http://www.claremont.org. </a>

<i>Lecture</i> No. 567, The Heritage Foundation<p>
In this speech given at The Heritage Foundation's Resource Bank Annual Meeting, Indianapolis Mayor Stephen Goldsmith puts forth ways in which Americans can liberate themselves for self-government. He begins his speech by discussing his experience as mayor and how he eschewed the public policy trends of the last thirty years of continuously raising taxes and establishing social programs and control mechanisms to solve the city's problems. As mayor, he has contracted out several city services, set up incentives for social workers to place welfare recipients in jobs, connected kids in tough neighborhodds to their local churches, fought for school choice, and overall, allowed flexibility and innovation in the delivery of public services. Goldsmith calls for devolution, but warns that it will not be successful unless it leads to a market-based system for providing government services. The system has to recognize that "the way to create true value is to let citizens and taxpayers make decisons that are in their own best interests." 5pp.  CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a>

<b>Initiative and Referendum in Pennsylvania,</b> by Charles E. Greenwalt II<p>
Commonwealth Foundation<p>
The process of "direct democracy," by way of initiatives and referendum, has fallen short of what reformers had in mind because of its extreme vulnerability to corruption. The question is, writes Charles Greenwalt, Senior Policy Associate at The Commonwealth Foundation, should Pennsylvania join the list of 24 states (and the District of Columbia) that have adopted procedures for statewide initiatives and the 25 states (and the District) that have adopted statewide referendum? Some of the major opposition relates to issues involving "finances," which would only allow those special interest groups with a good financial backing to get their issues on the ballot. Another problem the opposition raises is the belief of a 'complexity' of issues', which argues that the average or even slightly above average citizen would not really understand what he/she was voting on because the topics are too complex for their understanding. Proponents see this "direct" process as a must and point to the Pennsylvania Constitution, which says that the power and right to make laws ultimately rests with the citizentry. In addition, proponents of initiative and referendum believe that a higher voter turnout that develop and provide additional checks on lawmakers. Either way, concludes Greenwalt, what will work for one state may not work for another, thus each state must decide individually if the process of initiative and referendum outweighs the cost of corruption. 40pp.  CONTACT: The Commonwealth Foundation for Public Policy Alternatives, 3544 North Progress Avenue, Suite 101, Harrisburg, PA  17110, 717/671-1901, fax 717/671-1905.

<b>Setting Limits: The Truth About Why Congress Defeated the Term Limits and Balanced Budget Amendments in 1995, </b>by Cleta Deatherage Mitchell<p>
Americans Back in Charge<p>
Cleta Deatherage Mitchell argues that the American people instinctively know that term limits will permanently limit the time that politicians can spend in Washington and further that a balanced budget amendment will permanently limit money that politicians in Washington can spend. Moreover, these amendments will restore to the Constitution the notion of a finite federal government, something that was implicit in the design of the government and understood by the Founders as an essential part of the system they created. In addition, Mitchell identifies and outlines the motivations of the obstructionists in Congress who blocked these reforms. 95pp.  CONTACT. Americans Back in Charge, 900 2nd Street, N.E., Suite 200A.

<b>Rethinking Divorce,</b> by William A. Galston<p>
Center of the American Experience<p>
William A. Galston, Director of the Institute for Philosophy and Public Policy at the University of Maryland, surveys the ramification of divorce upon America's children, and calls for a reexamination of divorce laws in the United States. Galston holds that America currently tolerates a system that cares more for adults' interests than for children's.  Because of this, he argues, millions of children each year are being adversely affected by divorces-which the current legal and cultural environment permits. To remedy this, Galston states that Americans must first make it the country's goal to both reduce the number of divorces involving minor children, and, when such divorces are unavoidable, seek to mitigate their consequences for the children. Next, he recommends implementing social and legal changes to help couples before and during marriages, as well as at the threshold of divorce.  He also advocates eliminating the unilateral no-fault divorce system when there are children involved.  If divorce cannot be prevented, Galston advocates working to minimize the effects upon children by attempting to prevent diminished income, diminished parenting time, and the disruption of established ties. 5pp.  CONTACT: Center of the American Experiment, 1024 Plymouth Building, 12 South 6th Street, Minneapolis MN 55402, 612/338-3605, fax 612/338-3621.<p>

<b>Hollywood's Two Big Lies,</b> by Michael Medved<p>
<i>Declarations of Independence</i> Vol. 3, No. 1, Independence Institute<P>
Film critic Michael Medved condemns the Hollywood entertainment industry for what he calls their "two big lies:" 1) their claim that they present a realistic picture of the world; and 2) that they tailor their work to meet consumer demands. Taking on the first claim of Hollywood insiders, Medved critiques their portrayal of violence, sexuality, and religion. Next, he provides empirical evidence that more traditional, family-oriented entertainment fares better at the box office than more violent, sexually explicit fare which the industry claims the public wants. Medved asserts that people in Hollywood are not motivated by any desire to have their work mirror real life, or even make money. Their real desire, he claims, stems from a desire to win the approval of their peers for producing shocking and untraditional work. To combat this phenomena, Medved recommends that the American public should be more selective about the television programs and films they choose to watch. Their individual boycotts may not impact industry decisions, he writes, but it will impact their own lives. If they are not seeing the negative images of Hollywood, they can not be directly harmed by them.  5pp.  CONTACT: Independence Institute, 14142 Denver West Parkway, No. 101, Golden, CO  80401, 303/279-6536, fax 303/279-4176.

<b>On the Frontline of the Culture War: Recent Attacks on the Boy Scouts of America,</b> by William A. Donohue<p>
Claremont Institute<p>
William Donohue, President and CEO of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights, examines the attack launched upon the American Boy Scouts by various groups charging them with discrimination.  Donohue begins his essay by first examining the principles upon which the organization was first founded.  Asserting that the Boy Scouts were intended to be a group dedicated to instructing young men on how to live moral, upright lives, he argues that the exclusion of atheists and homosexuals is in accordance with the group's mission.  Next, Donohue documents several recent court cases brought against the organization by various individuals in the homosexual, atheist, and feminist communities.  His next area of analysis focuses on the cultural war he feels the liberal establishment and members of the cultural elite have declared against the Boy Scouts.  Donohue then examines the role of the ACLU in the legal proceedings, arguing that an anti-family, anti-God bias permeates the legal association and is prompting it to promote  an agenda which seeks the exclusion of morality and tradition from the American landscape.  The essay concludes with an afterward by Edward J. Erler, Senior Fellow at the Claremont Institute, which recounts the recent court rulings pertaining to the Boy Scouts, most of which seem to favor the group's right to ascribe to its traditional moral code.  37pp.  CONTACT: The Claremont Institute, 250 West First Street, Suite 330, Claremont, CA 91711, 909/621-6825, fax 909/626-8724, e-mail <a href="mailto: 2026935@mcimail.com">2026935@mcimail.com,</a> Internet <a href="http://www.claremont.org"> http://www.claremont.org.</a><p>

<b>The New Majority: The "Leave Us Alone" Coalition,</b> by Grover G. Norquist<p>
<I>Imprimis</I> Vol. 25, No. 5, Hillsdale College<p>
 Grover Norquist, President of Americans for Tax Reform, asserts that America is currently in the midst of a historic political realignment.  This shift is occurring, Norquist writes, as traditional liberal coalitions break down, and a more conservative coalition forms.  He terms this new political coalition the "Leave Us Alone" coalition, describing its members as ordinary men and women motivated by their love for freedom, family and tradition, while sharing the common desire of being left alone by the government.  The opposition they face in their efforts to control the political landscape, Norquist calls the "Takings Coalition."  He claims that while for years this alliance has been made up of groups wanting the government to take money from other Americans and give it to them, they are now fighting amongst themselves, and their numbers are shrinking. With victory for the "Leave Us Alone" coalition in sight, Norquist outlines a four-step plan to insure their success. According to him, they must: 1) oppose any and all tax increases; 2) end the Left's sense of inevitable victory; 3) seize the moral high ground; and 4) defund the opposition. 5pp.  CONTACT: Hillsdale College, Hillsdale, MI 49242, 800/437-2268.

<b>The Intellectual Foundations of the Cultural Decline,</b> by Stephen B. Young<p>
Center of the American Experiment<p>
Stephen B. Young, member of the Board of Trustees at the Center of the American Experiment, argues that a powerful force has been eating away at the soul of American society in recent years.  This force he attributes to a line of political thought which holds personal license and moral relativism as superior to the American tradition of freedom and liberty under the rule of law. Intellectually, Young ascribes this philosophy to a French ethic originating in Rousseauian theory. The triumph of this ethic over that purported by English philosophers Bacon, Locke, Hume, and Smith and German writers Kant and Hegel, generated what Young terms "the deconstruction of traditional norms and ethics."  For the origins of its growing dominance in modern American thought, Young looks to the Vietnam war and the need of baby boomers to find a social philosophy that supported their opposition to the traditional claims of the American state. Young not only criticizes the prevalence of this ideology in American society in general, he also examines its specific impacts upon America's colleges and universities.  Its existence there, he charges, has made any true leadership or reform impossible. To solve this widespread problem, Young calls for society at large to demand greater accountability amongst themselves and within the university community.  15pp.  CONTACT: Center of the American Experiment, 1024 Plymouth Building, 12 South 6th Street, Minneapolis, MN  55402, 612/338-3605, fax 612/338-3621

<b>Public Policy Grantmaking: Four Women Donors Offer Their Views, </b>by Ethelmae Humphreys, Heather R. Higgins, Sue Anschutz Rodgers, and Kristin Avansino<p>
<I>Alternatives in Philanthropy </I>June 1996, Capital Research Center<p>
While women control approximately 60 percent of the nation's wealth and are gaining more and more prominence in the workforce, the Capital Research Center reports that women donors are less likely than men to support non-profit organizations promoting changes in public policy.  This issue of <I>Alternatives in Philanthropy</I> takes a look at four women serving at key positions at foundations who do contribute to institutions involved in public policy.  Ethelmae Humphreys, Chairman and President of the Humphreys Foundations, discusses her work to promote a free society, outlining the parameter her foundation has set for public policy recipients and her devotion to social issues.  Next Heather R. Higgins, Director of The Randolph Foundation, writes about the important benefits of contributing to public policy groups rather than just giving directly to charities.  Then, Sue Anschutz-Rodgers, President and Executive Director of The Anschutz Family Foundation, discusses how philanthropic donations to public policy best facilitate the interplay between business, government, and the non-profit sector.  Finally, Kristin A. Avansino, President and Executive Director of the E.L.

<b>The Council on Foundations: The Era of Lady Bountiful Is Over Message to America</b><p>
<I>Foundation Watch </I>Vol. 1, No. 5, Capital Research Center<p>
From April 22nd through 24th in Atlanta, Georgia, the Council of Foundations held their annual meeting. The program, comprised mostly of liberal activists and philanthropists, did feature conservatives Father Richard Neauhaus, founder of the journal <I>First Things,</I> and John Von Kannon, Vice President at The Heritage Foundation.  According to the Capital Research Center, the convention was representative of modern philanthropy's obsession with appearances. More than one hundred awards were distributed for accomplishments in public relations, yet not one program was commended for delivering lives from welfare, helping drug users overcome their addictions, or helping the handicapped.  In other words, for their charitable contributions. Much of this arises, asserts Foundation Watch, from the Council's current President, Dorothy Ridings,  and her obsession with media relations.  But in the Council's focus on how people perceive their actions, they are forgetting to carry out their true mission, claims the article. Foundation Watch suggests that the Council reaffirm the centrality of service to the mission of philanthropy, recognizing where America's charitable institutions have gone wrong.  7pp.  CONTACT: Capital Research Center, 727 15th Street, N.W., 8th Floor, Washington, DC 20005, 202/393-2600, fax 202/393-2626.

<b>All the King's Horses and All the King's Men: What Would Charity Do Without Them?</b> by Leslie Lenkowsky<p>
<I>Philanthropy </I>Vol. IX, No. 3, Philanthropy Roundtable<p>
Leslie Lenkowsky, President of the Hudson Institute, examines the controversy in the philanthropic community over proposed changes in their relationship with the federal government.  He notes that while much of the American public supports philanthropic groups assuming greater responsibility for social work, those same groups fear the repercussions of losing government funds.  But Lenkowsky argues that partnership has actually harmed the work of philanthropies more than it has helped them. To support this, he points to the restrictions placed upon programs, and the realignment of priorities to match government demands.  Another problem arising from the mutual dependency of the federal government and philanthropies, according to Lenkowsky, has been that their goals and beliefs have merged, depriving the relationship of any diversity of thought, and along with that, any vitality.  Lenkowsky compares their relationship to a dysfunctional marriage that leaves both parties worse off.  To remedy these problems, he calls for a reexamination of their partnership that will lead to the formation of a new partnership, where government and philanthropic organizations maintain a greater degree of separation from each other. This, Lenkowsky believes, would facilitate a reordering of priorities, increased flexibility, and a reinvigorated private sector more capable of meeting society's needs.  6pp.  CONTACT: The Philanthropy Roundtable, 320 North Meridian Street, Indianapolis, IN  46204-1725, 317/639-6546.

<b>Liberalism and Community,</b> by Steven Kautz<p>
Social Philosophy & Policy Center<p>
Steven Kautz, Assistant Professor of Political Science at Emory University, defends the classical liberalism of Locke and Montesquieu, against its communitarian critics.  According to Kautz, communitarians have charged liberalism with being both morally and politically deficient.  He counters these arguments by first exploring the problem of community as it has evolved in recent years. Kautz then looks at the various disagreements which have taken place between Democrats and Republicans. The next component of Kautz's analysis centers on the arguments of three important, new communitarians: Richard Rorty, Michael Walzer, and Michael Sandel. Contrasting their views against more traditionally liberal philosophies, he discusses Walzer's account of moral reasoning, Barber's concept of the nature of republican community, and Cory's writings on the nature of the self. Kautz also addresses the issues of patriotism, self-government, and virtue, ultimately confronting the question of whether liberal reason can sustain the moral life of a community. Kautz concludes that it is the very liberalism which communitarians attack that has made the notion of community possible, that because of its tenets people can live together in a peaceful, prosperous and just society. 232pp.  CONTACT: Social Philosophy and Policy Center, Bowling Green University, Bowling Green, Ohio 43403-1088, 419/372-2536, fax 419/372-8738.

<b>The Communitarian Challenge to Liberalism,</b> edited by Ellen Frankel Paul, Fred Miller, Jr., and Jeffrey Paul<p>
Social Philosophy and Policy Center<p>
This book focuses on the debate over the protection of individual rights verses the importance of community interests.  The collection of essays included in this volume addresses questions such as whether individual rights should trump group rights, the role communities ought to play in shaping their members' values, and the extent to which government should promote community values. One series of essays deals with conflicts between liberal and communitarian doctrines on the nature of moral agency and the functions of good government. Another collection focuses on alternative ways to conceive of the two doctrines and challenges the basic assumptions about the harmful effects of capitalism on communities. Also explored in this volume are the basic questions of whether it is possible for any society to have one common good, whether culturally diverse states can ever become true communities, and whether participation in the community should be voluntary or mandated by the government. Contributing to this work, and coming from a variety of perspectives are: Neera K. Badhwar; Martha Nussbaum; John Haldane; Chandran Kukathas; Will Kymlicka; David Conway; Steven Kautz; Ronald Beiner; Cass R. Sunstein; George B. Fletcher; Stephen Macedo; Benjamin R. Barber; and James S. Coleman. 306pp.  CONTACT: Social Philosophy and Policy Center, Bowling Green University, Bowling Green, Ohio 43403-1088, 419/372-2536, fax 419/372-8738.

<b>The Cost of Race and Gender Preferences in California Government Contracting,</b> by Tom McClintock<p>
<I>Briefings</I>, No. 1996-53, Claremont Institute<p>
Tom McClintock, Director of Economic and Regulatory Affairs at the Claremont Institute, argues that when arbitrary distinctions are made on factors such as race or gender, quantifiable costs are incurred. The author examines the financial costs associated with such policies, specifically with respect to California government. McClintock relates that affirmative action and racial preferences in California permeate many aspects of life, including education, and that federal requirements incur additional costs. The costs are divided six ways between private and public sectors costs and include costs to government from above market prices, caused by reduced competition, and opportunity costs associated with the application of resources below their highest and best use. 10pp. CONTACT: The Claremont Institute, 250 West First Street, Suite 330, Claremont, CA 91711, 909/621-6825, fax 909/626-8724, e-mail <a href="mailto: 2026935@mcimail.com">2026935@mcimail.com</a>, Internet <a href="http://www.claremont.org">http://www.claremont.org.</a>

<b>Still Choosing by Color,</b> by Michael Lynch<p>
<I>Briefings </I>No. 1996-53, Claremont Institute<p>
Michael Lynch, Public Policy Research Fellow at the Pacific Research Institute, looks at the recent report by the U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights (OCR) on the admissions process at The University of California, Berkeley, calling the validity of their findings into question. For seven years, the OCR has been investigating whether race played an undue influence on admittance to the University. Recently, they concluded that the admissions policy does not discriminate on the basis of race. Lynch holds, however, that the, OCR's findings notwithstanding, race does play a major role in admissions at Berkeley. He charges that the OCR's report does not include even the most basic data on which it should have formed its conclusions (applicant pool versus admission data and SAT GPA data for the various admission categories and ethnic and racial groups). When this matrix of criteria is examined, according to Lynch, it reveals that white and Asian applicants were not given the same access to reviews and were seriously underrepresented  in acceptances when compared to their numbers in the applicant pools. Based upon the sheer empirical evidence, Lynch concludes that the admission policies of UC Berkeley would be found unconstitutional under the recent Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling in Cheryl Hopwood v. State of Texas.

<b>Virtuous Markets: The Market as School of the Virtues, </b>by Ian Maitland<p>
Center of the American Experiment<p>
Ian Maitland, Senior Fellow at the Center of the American Experiment, questions the assumption that the market destroys virtues such as honesty, loyalty and responsibility.  He asserts that proponents of that philosophy base their belief on the existence of a self-seeking, individualistic mindset which supposedly reigns there. This camp sees the market as both destroying the virtues within society and undermining the market's own moral foundations.  Maitland, however, takes a different point of view.  He argues that rather than undermining societal virtue, the market actually works to generate them. In order for businesses to function successfully, he asserts, they must be staffed by individuals who trust and are able to work with each other.  Trustworthiness, self-control, and sympathy are all virtues he claims the market requires and, because of that need, promotes.  Maitland concludes by calling into question the modern presumption that competition forms the basis of the market system, asserting that cooperation in fact is the most fundamental aspect.  11pp.  CONTACT: Center of the American Experiment, 1024 Plymouth Building, 12 South 6th Street, Minneapolis, MN  55402, 612/338-3605, fax 612/338-3621.

<b>Theft By Consent: The Lottery's Economic and Social Impact on Alabama,</b> by John Hill<p>
Alabama Family Alliance<p>
John Hill, Policy Analyst at the Alabama Family Alliance, looking at the case currently being made in Alabama in favor of a state lottery, assesses its probable impact on the state's economy.  Despite the promised benefits lottery advocates claim Alabama would reap, Hill finds that any good to come from such programs would be minimal, while the harm would be significant.  By comparing one proposed model to a similar program already in place in Georgia, Hill concludes that the lottery is essentially a voluntary, regressive tax.  The scholarship money lottery revenues provide in Georgia go mostly to upper and middle class students, according to Hill, while the funds from the ticket purchases come mostly from the state's poor. Next, he asserts that lottery sales have led to a decline in food sales equivalent to the revenue of lottery ticket sales, thereby negating any supposed benefit to retailers.  He also documents that the legalization of state sanctioned gambling such as lotteries have been shown to lead to increases in the rate of violent crime, gambling addictions, and, indirectly, instances of spousal abuse. Hill also points to the wide-spread illegal purchases of lottery tickets by teenagers, and notes that administering lottery programs has proven costly in other programs where administrative costs have risen faster than any other form of revenue collection. On the whole Hill, concludes that a state lottery would be an inefficient and costly way to raise state revenues. 25pp.  CONTACT:  Alabama Family Alliance, P.O.
