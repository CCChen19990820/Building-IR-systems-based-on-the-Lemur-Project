<h2>Magazines & Journals</h2><p>


<b><i>City Journal </i></b><br>
Summer 96, Manhattan Institute<p>
This issue of <i>City Journal</i> features an article by Contributing Editor Sol Stern entitled "The Invisible Miracle of Catholic Schools." Stern illustrates how inner-city Catholic schools in New York have educated some the neediest and uneducable kids from the city's most troubled neighborhoods, for a third of what taxpayers spend per pupil for the city's public schools. Despite the proven success of Catholic schools, Stern notes that liberals have ignored them in their search for solutions to the problems of New York's ailing public schools. Other articles in this issue include: "Special Ed: Kids Go In, But They Don't Come Out," by Kay Hymowitz; "Why L.A. is Bouncing Back," by Joel Kotkin; and "Reinventing the Port Authority," by Dick Netzer.  CONTACT: The Manhattan Institute, 52 Vanderbilt Avenue, New York, NY 10017, 212/599-7000.
<p>
<b><i>Governing</i></b><br>
July 1996<p>
Tom Arrandale, examines what one might expect with the transition from monopolies to competition in the power industry. Arrandale points out that although competition, by nature, brings lower prices, it may raise the price of power for less savvy purchasers. Other articles in this issue include: "Fish Tales," by Charles Mahtesian, which examines the aquarium building binge in several cities in recent years; "Ruckus Over Rating," by Penelope Lemov, which examines controversies in the bond rating system that could bring more government regulation; and "A Dollar's Worth of Government," by Jonathan Walters, which tries to determine exactly what one unit of government service costs.

<p>
<b><i>Headway</i></b><br>
July 1996<p>
This issue of <i>Headway</i> features several articles on the issue of what is "authentically black." Joseph Brown, an Editorial Writer with the <i>Tampa Tribune,</i> tells about when his "blackness" was question when he came out on a different side of a policy issue than the civil rights establishment. Meanwhile, Sharon Brooks Hodge shares a story of when her "authenticity" as a black was questioned because she is "articulate." Ron Freeman, President of The Freedom Foundation in Summit, Missouri, argues that authentic blackness should mean being free and responsible to one's self and family, rather than shifting blame and avoiding responsibility. Finally, Jacqueline Gordon, founder and Director of the Christian Women's Forum, laments that too many African-Americans see black "authenticity" and "genuiness" linked to being politically liberal. These viewpoints show how broad generalizations about blacks are enforced within the black community itself and how this serves to work against the original ideals of the civil rights movement. 38 pp.  CONTACT: <i>Headway,</i> 13555 Bammel N.

<b><i>The American Spectator</i></b><br>
August 1996<p>
In this issue, <I>American Spectator's</i> Senior Correspondent, John Corry, examines the Clinton Administration's attempt to feminize the military, appearently without regard for high rate of pregnancies on co-ed aircraft carriers. He suggests that "the people who did not wnat thier boys to go to Vietnam, Central America, or the Persian Guulf now want the girls to go everywhere else." the politization of the military threatens to undermine its primary reason for existing, "to fight and win wars." In another article entitiled "Bill's Mary Poppins," Rebecca Borders, a Washington Reporter, profiles long time Clinton advisor Betsy Wright.

<b><i>Carolina Journal</b></i><br>
April-May 1996, John Locke Foundation<p>
The April-May <i>Carolina Journal</i> centers on an articled entitled "Lemon and (Sub)Lime: Why We Must Re-engineer State Government." In this article, John Hood, President of the John Locke Foundation, compares state government to the U.S. auto industry to demonstrate the need for political leaders to take risks and be innovative. He finds that over the last 20 years the per-capita cost of state government in north Carolina and the price of a new car grew by about 70 percent in real terms. During the same period of time, however, the quality of these two products moved in separate directions. Concerning education and social services, increased state spending has not shown significant gains in education achievement and a key indicator in social well-being_the number of illegitimate births_has gotten worse. Meanwhile, during the same period of time, the struggling American automobile industry has dramatically improved and has reclaimed a competitive position in the world market. According to Hood, the comparison gives three lessons from the auto industry to state government: 1) competition is essential; 2) managerial flexibility is key; and 3) focus on results is crucial.

<p>
<b><i>Impact</i></b><br>
Spring 96, Foundation for Florida's Future<p>
This issue features articles on crime. Chuck Colson, former aid to President Nixon and Founder of Prison Fellowship Ministries, argues that returning to the basics of teaching children right and wrong will help lower future crime. Princeton's John Dilulio assesses the juvenile crime situation in Florida and shows that a future wave of "superpredators" is on its way.

<b>CENTER  FOR INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS</b><p>
<b> CIR Wins Reversal in Fourth Circuit in Smith v VCU</b><p>

In <i>Smith, et al v. Fourth Commonwealth University,</i> CIR is representing five male professors at VCU who claimed sex discrimination when the school gave an en masse raise to female professors in 1992. On May 10, 1996 an en banc panel of the Fourth Circuit issued a decision reversing a district court's grant of summary judgment for the University. The opinion of the court obtained the support of six judges with three concurring and five dissenting.
<p>
The en banc decision rejected the VCU attempt to justify the raises with a regression analysis showing pay disparity between the genders. The court said that there was an issue of material fact whether some of the factors excluded from VCU's study_like performance, productivity and merit_ skewed the results and permitted a false finding of "gender disparity." In separate concurrences, Judge Wilkinson wrote that the "search for knowledge is too important to sacrifice to the spirit of separatism"; and Judge Luttig hailed the importance of merit and performance in salary decisions at VCU and declared the study performed there to be inadmissible evidence of a pay disparity.
<p>
<b>Texas Filed Petition for <i>Writ of Certiorari</i> in <i>Hopwood</i></b><p>
In <i>State of Texas, et al. v. Hopwood, et al.</i>, CIR and the firm of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher represent Cheryl J. Hopwood and Douglas Wade Carvell, two white applicants to the University of Texas Law School who were denied admission despite credentials that would have led to their admission had they been African-American or Mexican-American. In March, the Fifth Circuit held that the school's use of racial preferences in student admissions was unconstitutional and ruled that the Law School could not continue to consider race in its admission process. On April 30, 1996, defendants filed Petition for <i>Writ of Certiorari </I> asking the United States Supreme Court to take the case.
<p>
Defendants provided no less than six separate questions for review. They argued, <i>inter alia</i>, that: 1) Justice Powell's view in <i>Regents of California v. Bakke</i> that "diversity" constituted a compelling state interest is the law of the land: 2) the law school was permitted to rely upon discrimination in some of Texas' public elementary and high schools in adopting a race-based admissions policy, despite clear statements in Supreme Court opinions to the contrary, and :3) Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is unconstitutional to the extent that it permits damage claims against states. The Clinton Administration filed an <i>amicus </I> brief on defendants' behalf agreeing with the first two contentions, and, indeed, going further to assert that the law school had a compelling interest in <i>racial diversity</i> (as opposed to the more limited notion of diversity in Justice Powell's <i>Bakke</I> opinion). Even the Clinton Administration, however, could not adopt defendants' argument that the Title VI is unconstitutional.
<p>
The plaintiffs-respondents Hopwood and Carvell filed papers in May in opposition to Texas' petition  refuting these and other even less-plausible arguments. On July 1, 1996 the Supreme Court denied the petition for <i>Certiorari.</i> The case now returns to the District court for the issue of damages.

<b>Developments in the Milwaukee School Choice Litigation:</b><p>
The Wisconsin Supreme Court denied the state's motion to reconsider its ruling dismissing its original jurisdiction over the litigation. That means IJ will be in Dane County Circuit Court. 
<p>
The chief judge of the Dane County Court denied the state's motion to substitute Judge Paul Higginbotham. The judge has a liberal reputation, but seems committed to a prompt resolution of the case. Contrary to press reports, Judge Higginbotham has never issued any substantive ruling in this case_the injunction was issued by the Wisconsin Supreme Court, and remains in effect pending a ruling by Judge Higginbotham.
<p>
Following these two rulings, IJ promptly filed a motion to dissolve the injunction and to schedule an evidentiary hearing. Although IJ asked the court to dissolve the injunction in its entirety, they asked the alternative that it dissolve the injunction as to nonsectarian schools, because only one of the remaining legal issues affects them.
<p>
<b><i>Black v. Village of Park Forest</i></b><p>
The Institute challenges a housing inspection ordinance in a southern Chicago suburb that allows local officials to conduct warrant-less, non-consensus inspections of single-family rental homes. On June 25, IJ filed briefs in support of cross-motions for summary judgment in the case. Briefs will be filed throughout the summer and a decision could come as early as September. The Institute represents tenants who reside in rental homes in Park Forest. The objective of the lawsuit is to establish that if government inspectors wish to enter rental homes, they must first ask for and receive a tenant's explicit consent. If tenants do not wish to grant inspectors access to their homes, the government must obtain a search warrant based on some reasonable belief (probable cause) that the housing code is being violated.
<p>
<b>Davis Bacon Act Challenge</b><p>
Representing four black construction contractors and three public housing organizations, the Institute for Justice amassed historical and economic research showing that the Davis-Bacon Act was originally intended to discriminate against black construction workers and that it is still having that effect today. The Institute has submitted six briefs and three large appendices. A decision could come anywhere between the next moth or sometime next year.
<p>
<b>New Jersey Welfare Case</b><p>
The Third Circuit heard oral arguments on June 10 in the appeal of the district court's decision upholding New Jersey's welfare reform program. The district court held that freezing welfare benefits and refusing to give additional benefits for additional children does not violate the rights of AFDC recipients. Legal Services of New Jersey, with the assistance of the ACLU and NOW, appealed the decision. Representing three New Jersey AFDC recipients and three public interest organizations, the Institute for Justice submitted briefs in the district court and the appeals court. IJ's briefs showed how the New Jersey case fits into a carefully-planned welfare rights agenda, orchestrated by Legal Services attorneys. A decision is expected in the next few months.
<p>
<b>Inter-racial Adoption Case</b>
<p>
<i>Matthew O. and Joseph I. v. Texas Dept. of Protective and Regulatory Services,</i> the Institute's attack on barriers to interracial adoptions, a state trial court recently denied class certification. Judge F. Scott McCown Found that Lou Ann and Scott Mullen, acting as next friends to the proposed class of minority children, cannot adequately represent the class because neither is Mexican or African American, while most of the class members are. Thus, the court found the Mullens "lack the identity of interest necessity."
<p>
The court further found that the Institute's argument that the use of race in adoption is unconstitutional_combined with its overall efforts challenging racial classifications and the regulatory welfare state_create a "very serious conflict of interest" with the proposed class. Such a conflict also precluded class certification.

Devils Tower Triumph_Climbers in Business</b><p>
A landmark challenge brought by users of Devils Tower in northeastern Wyoming has ensured that all may use the nation's first monument pending a trial. An order from Wyoming federal district court prevents the National Park Service (NPS) from closing the site for religious observances by a number of Native Americans. The Wyoming court granted MSLF's motion for a preliminary injunction to stop the NPS from closing Devils Tower to commercial climbing to conform their conduct in furtherance of those American Indians' religious necessities (which) amounts to "impermissible governmental entanglement with religion."
<p>
<b>Victory in Crooked Lake II</b><p>
Property owners on Crooked Lake in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan won a second victory when a federal district court ruled in their favor in another challenge to the attempt by the U.S. Forest Service to regulate private property due to its adjacency to a federal wilderness area. On May 16, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan barred the Forest Service from enforcing regulations denying MSLF clients motorboats access to Crooked Lake. The court agreed with MSLF on all counts, ruling: only Congress may use the Property Clause; only federal land was designated as part of the wilderness; private land could become part of the wilderness only with the consent of the owner; buffer zones could not be created around the wilderness; and wilderness designation is "subject to valid existing rights."
<p>
<b>Gasoline Tax: Unconstitutional?</b><p>
As the national debate heats up on the controversial fuel tax that was part of the 1993 Clinton tax package, MSLF has asked the Supreme Court to rule that the tax was unconstitutional on the day President Clinton signed it into law. MSLF believes the tax violates the Constitution's Origination Clause since it failed to originate in the U.S. House of Representatives. The lawsuit challenging the tax was filed by the Wyoming Trucking Association before federal district court in Wyoming where the court held that it had no jurisdiction to hear the case. The district court ruled that, by act of Congress, any challenge to a federal tax must first be heard by the Internal Revenue Service. On appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, the appellate court, while expressing concern as to whether the Origination Clause was violated, agreed with the district court that Congress had prohibited suits such as the one filed by the Wyoming Trucking Association.

<B>NEW ENGLAND LEGAL FOUNDATION<P>
Punitive Damages Case</b><p>
In a case that has generated much publicity, the U.S. Supreme Court has, for the first time ever, reversed a state court award of punitive damages on the grounds that the damages were so excessive as to offend constitutional due process. This case may induce lower courts to begin to rein in spiraling punitive awards which have made some state courts into virtual litigation lotteries.
<p>
<i>Gore v. BMW </i>was an Alabama case awarding $2 million in punitive damages to a doctor whose BMW was repainted without his knowledge before he bought it. The case was a paradigm of the absurdities that occur under the current system which allows juries virtually complete discretion to award punitive damages. NWLF's <i>amicus</i> brief, filed on behalf of the  New England Council, argued for constitutional guidelines to restrain such awards. This decision begins that process.
<p>
<b>Massachusetts Employment Case</b><p>
After Ms. O' Brien, who had no written employment contract with the company, was detected making anonymous calls to her supervisor, she was fired. She sued for breach of contract in Superior Court and in <i>O'Brien v. NYNEX</I> she won a total judgment of $500,000. That award included, in addition to a large breach of contract award against the company, $100,000 against her supervisor for his malicious interference with her employment.
<p>
NELF argued to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court that the lower court had erred in finding that Ms. O'Brien could base a breach of contract action on the company's Personnel Manual. While the SJC did allow the contract action, it held, as NELF and NYNEX had argued, that if the Manual constituted a "contract," O'Brien had to follow all the rules in the contract including the grievance process. Since she never filed a grievance, the court held that she forfeited any "contract" right she may have had.
<p>
The court, however, did uphold the award against the supervisor personally. In a decision that may reflect the unusual facts of this case, the court held that a jury could find that the supervisor was so personally antagonistic to Ms. O'Brien that he forfeited future cases to ensure that this ruling does not create a loophole allowing fired employees to recover tort damages in employment cases. 
<p>
<b>Retroactive Property Tax Case</b>
<p>NELF will represent the Connecticut Business & Industry association in a Connecticut tax case involving Southern Connecticut Gas Company in which the primary issue is whether a town can reassess a taxpayer's listed property years after the tax was levied and paid.
Connecticut law requires owners of property to file an annual list of all real and personal property with the town in which the property is located. The town has a period to review the data and then it publishes a "Grand List" which includes all property in the town and its taxable values. In this case, a town seeking additional revenue reassessed the company's property years after the tax was paid.
<p>
Connecticut law permits the Grand List to be revised to include "omitted" property. The Superior Court rejected the town's effort to stretch that provision to cover a dispute over the property's value. If the town is successful, all Connecticut property owners will face a dramatically higher risk of retroactive property tax bills.
<p>
<b>NELF Fights Unemployment Compensation Award</b><p>
On behalf of Associated Industries of Massachusetts, NELF will file an <i>amicus</I> brief in the SJC in a Massachusetts unemployment compensation appeal which involves whether an employee who was fired knowingly violating a reasonable and uniformly enforced company policy can still receive unemployment compensation. The employee, a nursing aide, was fired for cursing an elderly patient in violation of a policy against verbal or physical patient abuse.
<p>
The Massachusetts Appeals Court reversed a lower court's denial of benefits, adding a "deliberate" glass to the statute. NGLF's brief will argue that that decision is legally wrong and would undermine laws and rules prohibiting patient and elderly abuse and, more generally, it would lower the already low threshold for receiving unemployment benefits, raising costs for Massachusetts employers and employees.
<p>
<b>Veteran's Tax Case Reaches End of the line</b><p>
After four years of litigation and a supporting brief from the U.S. Solicitor General, the U.S. Supreme Court has designed a petition for <i>certiorari </i>in NELF's effort to stop Massachusetts' policy of taxing federal military retirement benefits.

National Right to Work Foundation attorneys have filed unfair labor practice charges with the Washington State Personnel Board on behalf of a Tocoma hospital employee after a state agency and its union concealed information from newly hired workers detailing their rights to cut off the use of compulsory union dues for politics.
<p>
Western State Hospital social worker Jennie Stephenson brought charges which describe how the Washington Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS) and the Washington Federation of State Employees (WFSE) union, in new employee orientation programs routinely withhold details on the limits of union-mandated forced-dues payments.
<p>
Foundation attorneys charge that the failure of an employer to provide such information violated regulations concerning employment relations.
<p>
In her charges, Ms. Stephenson seeks an order to restore the constitutional rights of workers by requiring that DSHS immediately begin informing new employees of their rights to withhold forced dues for politics. She also is asking for a refund of nonchargeable fees, plus interest, collected in the last six months, the removal of barriers to challenging forced-dues amounts, and the full disclosure of the right to withhold forced dues to all members of the bargaining unit.

<B>WASHINGTON LEGAL FOUNDATION<P>
<i>BMW v. Gore</i>: Punitive Damages</b><p>
In a major victory for civil justice reform, the Supreme Court ruled in a 5-4 opinion on May 20, 1996, that a $2 million punitive damage award for minor paint damage to a BMW automobile was "grossly excessive" under the Due Process Clause of the Constitution. The landmark decision came only a few weeks after president Clinton, at the insistence of plaintiffs' lawyers, vetoed a measure that would have placed limits on the award of punitive damages in product liability case. WLF argued that the $ 2 million punitive damages, 500 times the amount of the compensatory damages, was clearly excessive in light of BMW's good faith effort to comply with applicable disclosure laws and reasonable industry standards.
<p>
<b><i>Bennett v. Plenert</i>: Endangered Species Act</b><p>
On May 24, 1996, WLF filed a brief in U.S. Supreme Court supporting the rights of persons affected by federal decisions taken under the Endangered Species Act to sue under the citizen suit provision of the ESA in order to challenge those decisions. WLF's clients include Senator Dick Kempthorne of Idaho, Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Drinking Water, Fisheries and Wildlife, Representative Richard W. Pombo, Chairman of the Resources Committee Task Force on Endangered Species, and Representatives Bill Baker, Helen Chenoweth and Gerald Solomon and the Fairness to Land Owners Committee. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit had ruled that only environmentalists who wish to protect endangered species have standing to challenge agency decisions in court. WLF argued that businesses, ranchers, property owners and others who are directly affected by decisions under the ESA should also have a standing to challenge the excessiveness of agency decision making under the ESA.
<p>
<b><i>Habeas Corpus </i>Reform Measure</b><p>
WLF filed a brief in the U.S. Supreme Court on May 17, in this expedited case to hear a challenge to the recently enacted <i>habeas corpus</i> reform measure. A hearing in the case was held on June 3, 1996. The death row defendant in this case challenged the constitutionality of the new law enacted earlier this year that limits the ability of death row inmates to file second and successive <i>habeas corpus </i>petitions. The law has a "gatekeeper" provision that requires that such petitions be first approved by a three judge panel of the respective U.S. Court of Appeals and that decisions granting or denying the filing of the petition cannot be reviewed in the Supreme Court. The oral argument centered around the question of whether Congress could deprive the Supreme Court of original jurisdiction to hear <i>habeas corpus </i>petition filed with the High Court. The last time such a petition was granted was over 70 years ago.
<p>
<b><i>Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona</i>: Official English</b><p>
On May 24, 1996, WFL filed a brief in the Supreme Court supporting a provision in the Arizona Constitution that requires state employees to speak English while on the job. In its brief, WLF represented 34 Members of Congress, the State of Nebraska, and the Claremont Institute, and argued that the First Amendment rights of government employed are not infringed by a state law requiring that official business of the state be transacted in English. In this case, a government employee argued that the First Amendment protected her right to settle damage claims against the State of Arizona in Spanish rather than in English.

</FONT></B></CENTER>
<hr><P>
<font size=3> 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Once in a while, someone comes up with an idea everyone can agree on. Michigan's Mackinac Center for Public Policy has come up with a way for all Americans to know exactly how much their employers have to pay the government -- and for what -- in order to keep them on the payroll. It's called the Right to Know Payroll Form.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	If your employer adopted this form, your pay stub would show every bit of money the government takes from your pocket each payday. And why shouldn't you have this information? You're a taxpayer and the government is supposed to serve you, not the other way around. These costs affect you directly. Who can object to your knowing? 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	The "Right to Know" pay stub would tell you how much your employer paid: 1) to administer federal, state and local taxes; 2) to comply with mandatory programs like the Americans with Disabilities Act, Family and Medical Leave Act, Equal Employment Opportunity Act, etc.; 3) for unemployment insurance; 4) for workers' compensation; 5) for the employer's share of Medicare; and 6) for the employer's share of Social Security. 
	<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Did you know all that was coming out of your paycheck? Well, we're not through, of course. We haven't mentioned the rest of the items that would appear on your pay stub: 1) withholding for federal income tax; 2) withholding for state income tax; 3) the employee's share of the Social Security tax; 4) the employee's share of the Medicare tax; 5) withholding for local income tax. 
	<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;After all that is deducted from your earnings, you get to keep what's left. Just so you have some idea how your pay stub would look money-wise, take the example provided by the Mackinac Center, based on current tax rates. John Doe's two-week pay stub starts with an amount of $1,026.59, which represents the total amount his employer must put up to pay all the costs we mentioned, plus pay John Doe. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	After the first group of costs listed above are taken out -- in other words, the "hidden" money that vanishes before Mr. Doe sees a single penny, even on paper -- John is left with a gross of $916.67. 
	<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now, take special note: The way John Doe's pay stub now reads, he has the impression that $916.67 is his total cost to his employer. Yet, the "Right to Know" payroll stub tells a different story: that his employer already has paid $109.92 to the government just to employ Mr. Doe. Every two weeks. And the same is true for every employee.	Then, all the rest is taken out -- Social Security, income tax, etc. And what is John Doe left with out of a total $1,026.59? Just $686.67. Another way to put it: Before John could be paid $686.67, the government had to be paid $339.92. 
	<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Well, now. Doesn't that seem like a lot? It does to me. Don't you think that if all Americans could see in this kind of detail exactly how much of their money is being diverted to the government -- much of it before they even know about it -- they might have a few more questions about why the government needs that much money and what is being done with it? I do. In fact, I think every employer should give this sort of accounting to every employee. 
	<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And many in Michigan already have. The largest, and most notable, is the State of Michigan. That's right, all 60,000 State of Michigan employees will receive a list of what the state -- the taxpayers, really -- must pay for their Social Security and Medicare taxes. Although the state will not provide employees with the costs of workers' compensation or unemployment insurance, this is a great first step. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Indeed, the Right to Know Payroll Form is a great idea. Imagine a country where every employee knew how much government <I>really</I> cost him or her in the form of lost wages. I suppose this kind of "better-informed citizenry" would make a few people in liberal, big-government circles just a wee bit uncomfortable. After all, people suddenly would see the hand of big government dipping into their wallets every couple of weeks, whereas before it was done on the sly. But liberal discomfort has never bothered me before.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	And it doesn't bother me now.

<I>Backgrounder</I> No. 1079, The Heritage Foundation<p>
John Hillen, Policy Analyst at The Heritage Foundation, writes that, America will continue to squander its military resources on such inconclusive and tangential operations as Somalia, Haiti, and Bosnia, if concrete guidelines for military intervention are not adopted. Hillen lists five criteria for military intervention: 1) it should defend national security interests; 2) it should not jeopardize the ability of the U.S. to meet more important security commitments; 3) it should strive to achieve military goals that are clearly defined, decisive, attainable, and sustainable; 4) it should enjoy congressional and public support; and 5) the armed forces must be allowed to create the conditions for success. Congress should also require, according to Hillen, that the National Security Strategy, an annual report by the President to Congress, contain: a prioritization of national interests and national security interests; a listing of criteria, such as those listed here, that will give guidelines for when, where, whether, and how the U.S. military should conduct military interventions; a set of criteria for deciding when and in what capacity the U.S. will participate in multilateral military operations through coalitions, alliances, and other structures; an unequivocal guarantee that the President will consult Congress before launching military interventions that are not national emergencies; and a declaration that U.S. military forces in interventions abroad will have clearly defined, decisive and attainable military objectives that can be achieved through proven military doctrine. 19 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto:Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a><p>

<b>The Imperative of American Leadership: 
A Challenge to Neo-Isolationism, </b>
by Joshua Muravchik <p>
The American Enterprise Institute<p>
Joshua Muravchik, a Resident Scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, calls for an active, interventionist American post-cold war foreign policy. Muravchik argues that at times "America must be the policeman -- at others, the mediator, teacher, or benefactor." Only America, as the sole superpower, can provide leadership in upholding world peace. Muravchik uses the case of Bosnia to illustrate his argument. He asserts that Europe's and the United Nations' unimpressive response to the conflict in the former Yugoslavia revealed the decay of the United Nations and remains as the saddest example America leaving leadership to others. He claims that the current "great divide" over American foreign policy "is no longer between hawks and doves but between 'Washingtonians' (isolationists and so-called 'realists' who want above all to 'avoid entangling alliances') and 'Wilsonians' (activists prepared to spend treasure and even blood to defend world peace)." He also believes that America's domestic problems -- both economic and social -- arise more from weakness of character than from lack of money or presidential attention. He believes that addressing domestic problems and conducting an active foreign policy go hand in hand. 261 pp. CONTACT: American Enterprise Institute, 1150 17th Street, N.W., Washington, DC  20036, 202/862-5800, fax 202/862-7178.

Bryan Johnson, Policy Analyst at the Heritage Foundation, examines the unsuccessful efforts of the World Bank to promote economic growth in less developed countries. In light of President Clinton's recommendation that the United States give more money to institutions like the World Bank, Johnson shows that the Bank's approach to economic development has not worked. Concerning the World Bank, Johnson says Congress should: 1) phase out financial support for it; 2) seek a General Accounting Office audit of its lending practices; 3) make remaining funding contingent on public access to its records and information; and 4) require that the Administration provide Congress with a report on the level of economic freedom in World Bank recipient countries. Johnson provides a detailed history of the bank, and illustrates its failed policies. In his conclusion, Johnson points out that although the World Bank played an important role in getting Europe on its feet after World War II, it has drifted from its original mission to become little more than a clearinghouse for international welfare. 21 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a><p>

<b>A Miasma of Corruption: The United Nations

<I>Policy Analysis</I> No. 253, Cato Institute<p>
According to Stefan Halper, a former White House and State Department official, the United Nations' lack of accountability to its member-nations has led to corruption, mismanagement and a disconnect between costs and benefits. Halper presents a detailed analysis of mismanagement at the U.N., citing such evidence of corruption as: "secretive budget practices; an ever-growing army of irresponsible, unaccountable bureaucrats; and a massive duplication of effort." Overall, he calls for a comprehensive, independent audit of the United Nations, followed by drastic downsizing and reform, including privatization of many agencies. If such steps are not taken, Halper recommends the United States consider terminating U.N. membership. 24 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC  20001, 202/842-0200, fax 202/842-3490, e-mail <a href="mailto: cato@cato.org">cato@cato.org</a>, Internet http://www.cato.org.

<a href="/heritage/library/categories/theory/fyi97.html"><I>F.Y.I</I>. No. 97,</a> The Heritage Foundation<p>
Mark Wilson, The Rebecca Lukens Fellow in Labor Policy at the Heritage Foundation, examines the conventional American wisdom that says that wages are down, the middle class is shrinking, corporations are getting fat, and the rich are getting richer at the expense of the poor. Wilson shows conventional wisdom to be wrong. For example, while there has been a decline in average real cash wages since 1973, most workers are better off today because their real compensation and real per capita income continue to increase. He also shows that higher profits benefit workers, while falling profits limit compensation growth. Wilson, concludes that to the extent that real wages are falling for some workers, more government programs, restrictions on trade, and increasing the minimum wage will not bring a solution. Policies that focus on the primary problems -- high taxes and slow productivity growth -- need to be implemented. 11 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a><p>

<b>Promise and Peril: Implementing a Regulatory Budget,</b> by Clyde Wayne Crews<p>
<I>Regulatory Reform Project,</I> Competitive Enterprise Institute<p>
Clyde Wayne Crews, Fellow in Regulatory Studies at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, illustrates how Americans live under a regime of "Regulation Without Representation," noting that much of today's regulatory rulemaking is done by agency bureaucrats not accountable to voters. He also points out that the amount of <I>non-tax</I> dollars government requires to be spent on regulation is equivalent to over one-third of the level of government spending. Crews proposes a "regulatory budget" that would enforce greater accountability by limiting the regulatory costs that agencies can impose on the private sector. Ideally, a full-scale budget paralleling the fiscal budget could be implemented. This would require Congress to divide a total budget among agencies. Crews argues that the real innovation of regulatory budgeting is its potential to make regulatory agencies feel the consequences of regulatory decision making, rather than the regulated parties alone. There are, however, some pitfalls to regulatory budgeting according to Crews. For example, under a budget, agencies have an incentive to underestimate compliance costs while regulated parties have the opposite incentive. Crews concludes that a regulatory budget is not a magic device that alone can reduce the current $647 billion cost of regulatory compliance. But, while burdens continue to increase and the benefits of regulation seems more ambiguous, it is necessary to make institutional changes that specify the purpose and reach of delegated regulatory power.  28 pp. CONTACT: Competitive Enterprise Institute, 1001 Connecticut avenue, N.W., Suite 1250, Washington, D.C., 20036, 202/331-1010, fax 202/331-0640.<p>

Stephen Moore, IPI Research Fellow, examines the sluggish economic growth of recent years, illustrating the distinct and deliberate change in fiscal policy that has taken place under Presidents Bush and Clinton. Moore shows that compared to the supply-side fiscal policies of President Reagan, the tax-and-spend polices of the 1990's raised the overall tax burden by 1.25 percent of GDP, real federal non-defense spending rose by 30 percent, median family income has fallen by 5 percent (or $2,100 per household) and that tax hikes have failed to deliver the promised revenue. Moore concludes that if the tax-and-spend policies of Bush and Clinton continue, the 1990's will produce the largest budget deficits and the slowest economic growth rate of any decade in the past half century. 29 pp.  CONTACT: The Institute for Policy Innovation, 250 South Stemmons, Suite 306, Lewisville, TX 75057, 214/219-0811, fax 214/219-2625, e-mail <a href="mailto: ipi@I-link.net">ipi@i-link.net</a>, Internet http://www.ipi.org.

<b>Market Opening or Corporate Welfare?<br>
"Results-Oriented" Trade Policy Toward Japan,</b> by Scott Latham<p>
<I>Policy Analysis</I> No. 252, Cato Institute<p>
Under President Clinton, the United States has become progressively more protectionist in trade policy according to Scott Latham, an international trade consultant. He argues that in trade disputes with Japan over cars, semiconductors and photographic film, the Administration policy constitutes "corporate welfare in the international arena." The trade disputes, according to Latham, are a result of American firms' enlisting intervention in trade by the government to make up for their previous neglect of the Japanese market. These firms seek "bureaucrat-to-bureaucrat managed trade, not free trade." This study reveals the biggest beneficiaries of the Clinton Administration's protectionist trade policy toward Japan, and concludes that American charges of closed Japanese markets for the disputed products are groundless. Overall, according to Latham, results-based trade policy is not about opening markets, but instead about granting special favors to policitally powerful U.S. industries. 47 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC  20001, 202/842-0200, fax 202/842-3490, e-mail <a href="mailto:cato@cato.org">cato@cato.org</a>, Internet http://www.cato.org.

<b>The Decline of the Nation-State in International Trade and Investment: Is the United States Losing Its Grip?</b> by William H. Lash, III<p>
<I>Policy Brief,</I> No. 168, Center for the 
Study of American Business<p>
William Lash, Adjunct Fellow at the Center for the Study of American Business, examines whether United States sovereignty and the concept of a nation state have been diminished with the expansion of trade agreements and the dominance of transnational corporations. He finds that the nation-state is alive and well in today's freer market place, as well as American sovereignty, arguing that what was widely perceived as a threat to U.S. sovereignty, the World Trade Organization (WTO), by law cannot usurp national sovereignty. Furthermore, 94 percent of U.S. investors have their portfolios limited to U.S. firms, while foreign investors still face many restrictions in the U.S. in industries such as nuclear energy, broadcasting, coastal and inland shipping, and domestic air transportation. Another reason nation states remain strong is cultural identity. Lash predicts that consumers and corporations clinging to cultural identity will fortify the notion of a nation-state and continue to support trade. Lash gives the examples of Canada excluding the U.S. operated Country Music Television and the EU restricting the import of non-European television programming and film. Efficiency, the concept that experts believed would lead to the demise of the nation-state by multilateralism, may not always be what the population desires, concludes Lash. 15 pp. CONTACT: Center for the Study of American Business, Washington University, Campus Box 1208, St. Louis, MO 63130-4899, 314/935-5630, fax 314/935-5688.

<b>Federal Estate and Gift Taxes: Are They Worth the Cost? </b><p>
The Center for the Study of Taxation<p>
This report was published by The Center for the Study of Taxation to illustrate the effect of estate and gift taxes on family businesses, federal revenues and the national economy. Many people presume that the estate tax will not affect them unless they have a large estate. However, a home, a modest investment portfolio, life insurance, retirement benefits, and/or business property can easily qualify as an estate in the taxable range. Ironically, the report notes that the tax does not even raise very much revenue for the federal government. The federal government spends the equivalent of 65 percent of the revenue raised by estate taxes just to enforce compliance with the tax. Overall, this report shows that estate and gift taxes cost people jobs by presenting a huge obstacle to business continuity and business growth as well as limiting the creation of new jobs and increasing the cost of capital accumulation. 16 pp. CONTACT: The Center for the Study of Taxation, 695 Town Center Drive, Suite 1460, Costa Mesa, CA 92626-1924, 714/641-8067, fax 714/641-3128.

<b>The Flat Tax and Small Business,</b> by Scott Moody<p>
<I>Issue Analysis,</I> No. 26, Citizens for a Sound Economy<p>
Scott Moody, Flat Tax Policy Analyst at Citizens for a Sound Economy, examines the effect of the proposed Shelby/Armey flat tax on small business. He finds that the flat tax simplifies the current income tax by dramatically downsizing the 600 different tax forms into just two, each the size of a postcard. This simplification would reduce the cost of complying with the current tax code for all businesses by 94 percent-from $150.6 billion per year to $9.4 billion a year. Moody also illustrates how small businesses bare a much higher compliance cost in relation to their total revenue than larger businesses The flat tax allows for higher capital spending by small businesses, and eliminates the double taxation that occurs when there is a capital gains tax. Investments in small businesses gain profits nearly exclusively as capital gains. So eliminating the capital gains tax would help small businesses immensely. 13 pp. CONTACT: Citizens for a Sound Economy, 1250 H Street, N.W., Suite 700, Washington, DC 20005-3908, 202/783-3870, fax 202/783-4687, Internet http://www.cse.org/cse.

<b>New Jersey Income Tax Cut Led to Savings, 
Not Rise in Local Taxes,</b> by Timothy Goodspeed and Peter Salins<p>
<I>Civic Report</I> No. 1, The Manhattan Institute<p>
Timothy Goodspeed, Professor of Economics at Hunter College, and Peter Salins, Professor of Urban Affairs and Planning at Hunter College and a Senior Fellow at the Manhanttan Institute, illustrate that Governor Whitman's income tax cut in New Jersey lead to savings in local taxes. They found that historically, "there has been little or no relationship between income tax rates, which have varied significantly, and property tax rates, which have increased consistently but moderately." In 1995, the first year of the Whitman tax cuts, there was virtually no change in real property taxes relative to 1994. Goodspeed and Salins also point to an economic phenomenon called "the flypaper" effect. The flypaper effect says that localities are more likely to spend lump sum grants from the state than they are to spend money raised by local revenues. This means, for example, that local school boards are more efficient with their funds when they have to answer directly to the local community. 10 pp. CONTACT: The Manhattan Institute, 52 Vanderbilt Avenue, New York, NY 10017, 212/599-7000, fax 212/599-3494. <p>

Robert Moffit, Deputy Director of Domestic Policy Studies at the Heritage Foundation, reports that the Prospective Payment Assessment Commission (PROPAC) and Physician Payment Review Commission (PPRC) have called on Congress and the President to slow the explosive growth in Medicare spending. PROPAC and PPRC are official panels that were established to advise Congress on Medicare reimbursement and physician payment reform. The panels gave Congress the following significant recommendations and opinions on general Medicare reform: 1) Medicare spending urgently needs to be controlled; 2) beneficiaries of Medicare need to be given more choices; 3) neither panel opposes Medical Savings Accounts; and 4) today's Medicare price controls cause limitations and heavy costs. Overall, Moffit concludes, the reports of these two commissions underscore the need for fundamental reform. 8 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a><p>

<b>The Establishment Strikes Back: Medical Savings Accounts and Adverse Selection,</b> by Peter Ferrara<p>

Peter Ferrara, Associate Policy Analyst at the Cato Institute, challenges the criticism directed toward Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs) as a component of proposed structural reforms of Medicare. Critics of MSAs argue that they would appeal only to the healthy while traditional Medicare would be left to serve the sick. Ferrara, however, shows that recent studies that argue this point are seriously flawed. Based on actuarial studies and experience in the private sector, MSAs will appeal to a wide cross section of the elderly, regardless of their health status. Overall, Ferrara concludes that MSAs remain the best hope for reforming the Medicare system. 12 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC  20001, 202/842-0200, fax 202/842-3490, E-mail <a href="mailt:cato@cato.org">cato@cato.org,</a>Internet http://www.cato.org.

<b>Perspectives on the Continuing Debate Over School Choice</b><p>
<I>Dialogue</I> No. 13, Pioneer Institute<p>
In the November 1995 issue of <I>Dialogue, "Responses to a Harvard Study on School Choice: Is It a Study at All?"</I> The Pioneer Institute gathered nine school choice experts to critique a draft manuscript of <I>Who Chooses, Who Loses? Culture, Institutions, and the Unequal Effects of School Choice,</I>edited by Harvard Professors Richard Elmore, Gary Orfield, and Bruce Fuller. Professor Fuller requested the opportunity to respond to Pioneer's critique. In this response, Fuller defends the impartiality of the research compiled by him and his colleagues. He also welcomes the stimulation to the debate that the Pioneer study contributes, but criticizes the fact that only advocates of school choice were invited for the critique. Fuller maintains that the empirical evidence shows that school choice is not the panacea that advocates proclaim. Terry Moe, Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution and participant in the Pioneer critique, responds to Fuller's defense of his study. Moe points out that the Harvard study was not undertaken by impartial researchers either. Furthermore, the Harvard study is, in reality, not a real "study" as its authors proclaim. The Harvard report was merely a collection of separate papers presented at a conference and complied into one volume. Moe writes that on the brute facts, the Harvard report and the Pioneer critique do not differ too much. The difference is in the interpretation. The Harvard report is negative and Moe thinks that this is unjustified. 8 pp. CONTACT: Pioneer Institute for Public Policy Research, 85 Devonshire Street, 8th floor, Boston, MA 2109, 617/723-2277, fax 617/723-1880.

<b>The Decline of Academic Standards in California Public Education: The Story Behind the Student Testing Fiasco,</b> by Ben Boychuk<p>
<I>Briefings</I> No. 1996-49, The Claremont Institute<p>
Ben Boychuk, Research Associate at the Claremont Institute, examines the issue of educational standards and educational reform. The essential question, asks Boychuk, is: Would schools be improved by raising standards in the present system, or is a more fundamental overhaul needed? To answer this, he looks at the state of California and their well-documented attempts at education reform by raising standards. "Back-to-basics" reforms in the early eighties, which refocused on skills instruction, such as grammar, spelling, addition, and subtraction, brought slow but steady improvement in student exam score. Later in the 1980's, however, state education officials shifted their focus away from basic skills and implemented policies popular at teachers' colleges and among progressive education theorists. In 1987, these abstract educational theories were implemented on a much more ambitious scale with the result being that verbal and math SAT scores dropped dramatically. Boychuk  urges parents to stress a "basics-first" philosophy in their local schools and not to just ask for stated curriculum goals and academic standards. Parents should monitor homework and/or classroom assignments for academic as opposed to an "attitudes" focus. For, districts, he suggests a review of current standards for academic rigor, appropriate scope and sequence. Districts should also eschew teaching fads and require basic instruction in reading, grammar, composition, correct spelling, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, fractions, and decimals. Finally, collective bargaining agreements with local teachers' unions should be re-examined to see if they interfere with curriculum reform efforts. 25 pp.  CONTACT: The Claremont Institute, 250 West First Street, Suite 330, Claremont, CA 91711, 909/621-6825, fax 909/626-8724, E-mail <a href="mailto: 2026935@mcimail.com"> 2026935@mcimail.com,</a> Internet http://www.claremont.org

<b>Superfund: The Shortcut that Failed,</b> by Richard L. Stroup<p>
<I>Policy Series</I> No. PS-5, Political Economy Research Center<p>
According to Richard Stroup, Senior Associate at PERC, Superfund, the federal program to clean up hazardous waste sites, was supposed to be a shortcut. The Environmental Protection Agency was given authority by Congress to clean up waste sites immediately and then bill the responsible parties. Stroup argues that Superfund has failed to achieve the desired results and that it should be scrapped. Superfund has replaced common-law procedures with nearly unchecked bureaucratic control. Overall, Stroup calls for Congress to allow both citizens who feel harmed (or at risk) and those accused of wrongdoing access to judicial review. This would curb the tendency by EPA, according to Stroup,  to create unsubstantiated and exaggerated fears in order to justify expensive cleanups. 28 pp. CONTACT: Political Economy Research Center, 502 S. 19th Avenue, Suite 211, Bozeman, MT  59715, 406/587-9591, fax 406/586-7555.

<b>Property Rights, Regulatory Takings, and Environmental Protection,</b> by Jonathan Adler<p>
Competitive Enterprise Institute<p>
Jonathan Adler, Director of Environmental Studies at The Competitive Enterprise Institute, challenges the notion that property rights undermine sound environmental conservation. Instead, he argues, they lie at its foundation. Under current environmental laws the federal government can, through regulation, take private land without just compensation. This directly contradicts the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The government pays the owner the value of his land when it takes the owner's property to create a publicly-desired resource, such as a military base, road, or wildlife preserve. However, when the government forces a property owner to alone bear a public burden on his land through regulation, the government rarely pays anything. For the last two decades, federal land-use control has been the most utilized way of achieving environmental objectives. Adler calls for Congress to ensure compensation for regulatory takings to restore Constitutionally guaranteed property rights and to lead toward the development of a new generation of environmental protection. Groups opposing compensation for regulatory takings argue that requiring compensation would impose an extreme financial burden upon the federal government. Adler argues that such claims are overstated and that requiring federal agencies to pay compensation would make them "more aware of the financial risks of over-relying on land-use regulation to achieve statutory goals." Other approaches, notes Adler such as incentive-based wetland conservation programs, present a possible way to achieve statutory goals on a far more cost-effective basis. Furthermore, forcing agencies to pay for the private property right they revoke through regulatory takings will encourage them to examine non-regulatory approaches to protecting the environment. Adler concludes that compensating landowners eliminates the negative environmental incentives created by the heavy hand of existing government regulations. 30 pp. CONTACT: Competitive Enterprise Institute, 1001 Connect

<b>Resolving the Tragedy of the Commons by Creating Private Property Rights in Wildlife,</b>
by Robert Smith<p>
Competitive Enterprise Institute's Center
for Private Conservation<p>
Robert Smith, Senior Environmental Scholar at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, argues that where human activity has contributed to species decline, the problem of overexplotation or overharvesting is a result of the resources being under public rather than private ownership. According to Smith, wherever there is public ownership one finds overuse, waste, and extinction. Private ownership, however, results in sustained-yield use and preservation. He uses the case of salmon to illustrate his point. Because no one owns the rights to salmon, each user of this common property resource is pitted against one another. This has lead to rapid depletion of the stock. Meanwhile, in some European countries, salmon fisheries are healthy because the rights to the salmon or the salmon rivers are privately owned. Game ranches, hunting preserves and safari parks also add support to the argument. Overexplotation and extinction of wildlife appears to stem from their treatment as a common property resource. The proper method for wildlife conservation, argues Smith, is creating private property rights. 24 pp. CONTACT: The Center for Private Conservation, Competitive Enterprise Institute, 1001 Connecticut Avenue, N.W., Suite 1250, Washington, DC 20036, 202/331-1010, fax 202/331-0640, e-mail <a href="mailto: cpc@cei.org">cpc@cei.org.</a>

John DiIulio, Professor of Politics and Public Affairs at Princeton, and George Mitchell, a member of the Governor's Task Force on Corrections, challenge arguments that American prisons are overflowing with low-level drug offenders and first-time non-violent criminals who can be safely released into the community. This study examined the portfolios of Wisconsin prisoners now serving sentences. This allowed DiIulio and Mitchell to trace the prisoner's criminal histories back to the juvenille justice system. They found that 91% of the inmates had current or prior conviction for a violent crime, the recidivism rate is approximately 90%, the majority had violated their probation or parole. The authors conclude that the people who really go to prison in Wisconsin are violent criminals and criminals with long records. 37 pp. CONTACT: Wisconsin Policy Research Institute, 3107 North Shepard Avenue, Milwaukee, WI  53211, 414/963-0600, fax 414/963-4230.

During the FY 1996 appropriations process, congressional leaders reduced a fraction of the funding for the LSC with a promise to end the federal subsidy by 1998. However, during the 1980s supporters and employees of LSC grantees fought efforts to reform federal subsidies to the Corporation. They mounted a massive lobbying campaign, financed in part by federal funds, and devised loopholes to avoid the few restrictions that eventually were imposed. With renewed pressure to reform in 1995, LSC fought back with strategies designed to ensure that their spending habits and politicized activities would continue-business as usual. Therefore, according to Boehm, it is imperative that Congress reaffirm its decision to phase out federal subsidies by 1998. 7 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org"> Insider@heritage.org.</a>

<b>Clinton's Judges: A Preliminary Analysis,</b>
by Clint Bolick<p>
<I>Issue Analysis #5,</I> The Goldwater Institute<p>
Clint Bolick, Vice President of Litigation at the Institute for Justice, gives an analysis of Federal judges appointed by President Clinton. He finds that on the whole, Clinton judges generally are more likely to favor defendants in criminal cases, and to view the power of the federal courts more expansively than judges appointed by Ronald Reagan or George Bush. He examines Clinton's judges in the U.S. Supreme Courts and the lower federal courts in the areas of civil rights and civil liability. 18 pp. CONTACT: Goldwater Institute, Bank One Center-Concourse, 201 N.

	This issue examines the nonprofit 501(c)(3) group The Sentencing Project (TSP), which is federally funded through a "major grant" from the Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice Assistance. The group issues papers that usually stress two points: 1) locking up criminals does not reduce crime; and 2) the criminal justice system is rigged against minorities. Instead of focusing on the finding of guilt and the appropriate punishment for criminal acts, TSP examines the sociology of the "root causes" of crime. Among the groups that TSP has great influence over are liberal judges, criminal defense attorneys, and law professors. Because their papers tend to blame criminal activity on the failures of society, their answer to crime is more government money for Social programs. TSP illustrates, according to the paper, why legislation should be passed preventing federal funds for groups to lobby for more federal funds.  4 pp. </ul>

<b>American Orphanages: How We Used to Care for Children,</b> by Marvin Olasky<p>
<I>Philanthropy, Culture & Society,</I> Capital Research Center<p>
Marvin Olasky, Senior Fellow at the Progress & Freedom Foundation, presents a short history of the American orphanage. This research comes in light of the search for alternatives of failed welfare programs and alternatives to government as the cure for societal ills. Much of his findings contradict the conventional history of American orphanages that is filled with images of child abuse and neglect due to the absence of close government oversight. For the most part, Olasky finds that the accepted history of orphanages is biased towards accentuating the negative aspects while preventing us from seeing the positive role that they have played in the past. 6 pp. CONTACT: Capital Research Center, 727 15th Street, N.W., 8th Floor, Washington, DC 20005, 202/393-2600, fax 202/393-2626.

<b>CIR Sues Delaware State Bar Association</b><p>

CIR represents three white students who were rejected from the Louis L. Redding Fellowship Program for first year law students in the State of Delaware because of their race. The Redding Program is operated by the Delaware State Bar Association and provides internships for first year law students from across the nation who want to spend a summer in Delaware. Virtually every significant law firm, various corporations, the Legal Aid Society, the U.S. Attorney's Office, and various state officials in Delaware participate in the Program by contributing money and/or offering internships to successful applicants. Successful applicants spend half the summer at another sponsoring employer, and receive approximately $8000 for the summer. This upcoming summer will be the second year of operation for the Redding Program. To date, no white students have been chosen for the Program. CIR has sued the United States, the Department of Justice, Gregory M. Sleet (the U.S. Attorney for the District of Delaware), the Governor, Attorney General, and Secretary of Finance of the State of Delaware, and various private entities. The lawsuit commenced in early April.
<p>
<b>CIR Sues College for Discriminatory Hiring Practices</b><p>

Dr. Ronald L. Reisner, a white male, was employed as a part-time Adjunct Professor of Government at John Jay College from 1987 to 1993. During that time, Dr. Reisner, who holds a law degree from Rutgers University and a Ph.D. from Columbia, received excellent teaching evaluations from students and outstanding performance ratings from his faculty peers.
<p>
In 1993, John Jay advertised for a permanent tenure track faculty position in public administration. The hiring committee selected a black candidate as its first choice and Reisner, who is white, as its "alternate." When the committee's first choice candidate turned down the school's offer of employment, Provost Basil Wilson, citing an inadequate "affirmative action" search, decided to leave the position open rather than offer it to Reisner, who taught the classes on a temporary one year contract.
<p>
The following year, Reisner reapplied and was one of three finalists for the position, the other two being black males. It turned out that one of the other finalists did not meet the minimum qualifications for the position and the other withdrew his application after questions were raised about his credentials. Once again, John Jay decided to extend the candidate search for a third year. Soon thereafter, when the candidate who had withdrawn from consideration announced that he was available again, the Department of Public Management immediately hired him and the other black finalist as part-time adjuncts for the 1994-95 academic year. The firm of Stroock & Stroock & Lavan, and the Center for Individual Rights filed a discrimination suit on Dr. Reisner's behalf in September, 1995. Discovery is proceeding and trial is scheduled to begin in January, 1997.

<b>INSTITUTE FOR JUSTICE</b><P>
<B>Battle for Choice in Ohio: Round I</b><p>

On May 15, the Institute for Justice filed its opening brief in the Ohio trial court in support of the school choice plan enacted last year. IJ worked closely with the state attorney general's office and clients and allies in Cleveland to compile necessary data. The Institute also took the lead in coordinating <I>amicus</I> briefs in this case. The Center for Education Reform hired Mark Snyderman of Gibson, Dunn, & Crutcher to draft a brief that was joined by a substantial number of choice supporters. The final brief is due June 20, and oral argument is scheduled for June 24 in Columbus. The Institute is working with Hope for Cleveland's Children and Councilwoman Fannie Lewis to transport parents and children to Columbus for the argument.
<p>
<b>IJ Files Cert. Petition in <I>Immediato v. Rye Neck School District</I></b><p>
On May 15, the Institute -- on behalf of the Immediato family of Mamaroneck, New York -- filed a petition for <I>certiorari</I> with the U.S. Supreme Court in a challenge to a "mandatory volunteering" program for public high school students. Such programs require that students perform community service in the manner prescribed by school officials or they will not graduate.
<p>
The centerpiece of the petition is the issue of parental liberty. The Institute will ask the Court to affirm the right of parents to direct their children's education as fundamental under the Fourteenth Amendment, and to restore much needed balance between public school authority and parental rights. Ironically, the Friday before the filing, President Clinton in a major policy address urged all public middle and high schools to mandate volunteering as a condition of graduation.

<b>	NATIONAL RIGHT TO WORK LEGAL DEFENSE FOUNDATION</b><p>

<b>Union's Arbitration Scheme Violated Teachers' Rights</b><p>
 
National Right to Work Foundation attorneys recently announced a victory for employee rights as a federal appeals court refused to defer to a teacher's union "arbitration" scheme designed to deny Michigan educators their right to cut off the use of their compulsory union dues for politics. The ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit came in a challenge by Michigan educators to the Michigan Educators Association (MEA) and National Education Association (NEA) teacher unions. The decision struck down the unions' attempt to use internal "arbitration" proceedings to preclude judicial consideration of the educators' claims that the unions' forced-dues exactions violated their Constitutional rights.

<b>	NEW ENGLAND LEGAL FOUNDATION</B><P>

<B>NELF and NAM Help Win Health Care Case</B><P>
The U.S. Court of Appeals in New Orleans has ruled in favor of the New England Legal Foundation and the National Association of Manufacturers in the fight against laws that threaten businesses' power to control health costs. The case, <I>Cigna Heath Plan v. Louisiana,</I> involved Louisiana's "any willing provider" law which allows any doctor to join the staff of a health maintenance organization or a preferred provider organization.
<P>These laws, which are supported by doctors and other health care providers, eliminate the economies of scale which HMOs and PPOs use to control medical care costs. If HMOs and PPOs cannot guarantee a certain volume of patients, they cannot negotiate lower prices. In turn, those groups will be unable to set their rates as low as they otherwise could, and an important brake on the health care cost spiral will be lost.
<P>
The Louisiana law was challenged by Cigna, a major insurer which operates PPOs in that state. On behalf of NAM, NELF filed a brief arguing that the law is preempted by the federal ERISA law, which bars states from enacting laws which "relates to" employee benefit plans. Since almost all group health plans are provided by employers, the court agreed with NELF that ERISA applies and states cannot interfere.
<p>
<b>Massachusetts Capital Gains Controversy</b><p>
In 1994, the Massachusetts legislature enacted a major tax reform aimed at encouraging investors to hold onto capital assets longer by adopting a tax which declined depending upon the length of time they were held. That law was promptly challenged by a group supported by public employee unions which argued that the law violates a state constitutional provision which requires a uniform rate of taxation on income derived from the same "class of property."
<p>
NELF will represent Associated Industries of Massachusetts in supporting the law. The constitutional issue depends upon analysis of just what is being taxed upon the sale of a capital asset. Plaintiffs' simplistic position is that "sales are sales" and the length of time an asset was held does not change its "class." NELF, supported by economists and venture capitalists, will instead argue that what is being taxed on sale of a capital asset is the seller's personal exercise of discretion in choosing an asset and the time at which to sell it. Affidavits in this case show that in the real world of investments, assets with different holding periods are valued differently. The new law thus accords better with actual financial practice as well as providing a spur to longer-term, stable investments that benefit the state's economy and its people.

<p>
<b>THE RUTHERFORD INSTITUTE</b><p>
<b>Supreme Court to Hear Free Speech Case</b><p>
The Rutherford Institute has filed a "friend of the court" brief in a case before the Supreme Court dealing with the rights of pro-life protesters. The brief argues that the injunction against protesting in a "floating" bubble zone, which pro-lifers in <I>Schenk v. Pro-Choice Network of Western New York</I>  face, is an unconstitutional, prior restraint on free speech.
<p>
The injunction provides for a 15-foot floating bubble zone around clinic clients. If anyone in the zone objects to a pro-lifer speaking to them from outside the zone, they can ask pro-lifers to be silent-on pain of being held in contempt of court. Under this injunction, clinic escorts can demand that the pro-lifers not speak to the clients whether the clients desire it or not. The Supreme Court has previously upheld the concept of a bubble zone (see <I>Madsen</I>), but the "floating" bubble zone goes beyond what was permitted.

<b>SOUTHEASTERN LEGAL FOUNDATION</b><p>
<b>U.S. Supreme Court Appeal in Voting Rights Act Case on Course</b><p>
SLF's attempt to intervene on behalf of Georgia voters in the U.S. Department of Justice lawsuit against the State of Georgia, which was denied, gets another shot at judicial scrutiny-this time, from the U.S. Supreme Court. SLF Chairman Robert J. Proctor and General Counsel Henry D. Granberry, III, are preparing briefs on the critical legal question of intervenor status of voters in Voting Rights Act cases. SLF has argued that the State did not adequately represent the interests of Georgia voters in the lawsuit because the State was focused on defending specific voting district changes enacted by the legislature last year. SLF's potential intervenors include a sitting State Representative, a candidate for the State Senate, and a registered Georgia voter. Appeals under the Voting Rights Act are direct to the U.S. Supreme Court and therefore do not require application for <I>certiorari.</I>

<b>WASHINGTON LEGAL FOUNDATION</b>
<p>
<b>Deportation Supported in Fraud Case</b><p>
WLF filed an <I>amicus curiae</I> brief in the U.S. Supreme Court asking for the reversal of an appeals court decision that would require the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to overlook flagrant immigration fraud. In the case, <I>INS v. Yang,</I> the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the INS cannot deport an alien based on the alien's fraudulent acts and misrepresentations, no matter how many or how long maintained, as long as the alien's motive for the misconduct is to enter and stay in this country. WLF argues that federal immigration law clearly gives the INS discretion to deport an alien for committing immigration fraud.
<p>
The case involves a Taiwanese couple who perpetrated a lengthy course of fraud beginning in 1978. The fraud was discovered by the INS during an investigation of immigration fraud committed by their children. In January of 1992, the INS issued the couple an order to show cause why they should not be deported. Overruling the Board of Immigration Appeals, the Ninth Circuit held that the INS could not consider the fraudulent acts. The court ruled that the INS had adopted a policy of forgiving an alien's "initial fraud" employed "to secure entry into the country" and that all of the subsequent fraudulent acts were "inextricably intertwined" with the initial fraud.
<p>
In its brief, WLF argues the statute involved commits the waiver of deportation to the agency's discretion. WLF further argues that even if Congress had not expressly committed the waiver of deportation to the agency's discretion, the Supreme Court's <I>Chevron</I> doctrine requires that INS's reasonable interpretation of the statute be given deference.
<p>
<b>FDA Chief David Kessler Refuses to Appear for Deposition</b><p>
David A. Kessler, Commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), refused to appear for questioning in response to a notice of deposition served by WLF in <I>Washington Legal Foundation v. Kessler</I>. The lawsuit challenges the constitutionality of FDA's restrictions on peer-reviewed journal articles, excerpts of medical textbooks, and other information about off-label uses distributed to doctors by pharmaceutical companies. FDA has maintained in the suit that it has no policy of restricting such materials. Documents obtained by WLF, however, indicate that the agency has threatened enforcement actions against firms that distributed such materials. WLF seeks to depose Commissioner Kessler to give the agency an opportunity to clarify its position with Kessler's own prior statements.
<p>
<b>Supreme Court Urged to Hear Property Rights Case</b><p>
In <I>Mock v. Pennsylvania Dept. of Environmental Resources,</I> WLF asked the Supreme Court to review a Pennsylvania state court decision holding that a land owner could not obtain compensation under the Fifth Amendment for a denial of a permit to fill "wetlands" for development. Conrad and Barbara Mock sought a permit to fill eight-tenths of an acre out of four acres of wetlands. The property, surrounded by a cement factory, a tire store, and other commercial development, was rendered valueless by the lower court decision. WLF argues that compensation is required under the Supreme Court's landmark 1992 decision in <I>Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Commission.</I>

<h3>May 1996 <i>Insider</i></h3>
<p>
<b><font size=4>The States and The People: An Historic Coalition</font></b></center>
<hr><p><font size=3>
I have just returned from the Nineteenth Annual Resource Bank Meeting in Chicago, April 25-26, and I am encouraged. Despite frustrating wheel-spinning in Washington, the conservative movement is not sitting around, grumbling, waiting for the political leadership to get its act together.  We are taking matters into our own hands through an amazing variety of nonprofit and grassroots adventures around the country.  We need this kind of responsible citizenship and creative self-government to put America back on track.  If the people will lead, the leaders will follow.<p>
As you may know, the Resource Bank -- the Heritage department responsible for publishing <i>The Insider</i> -- is Heritage's information clearinghouse, strategy forum, and coalition builder for leading policy groups, scholars, and activists.  At this year's annual meeting, entitled "The States and The People: Setting the Agenda for Devolution," 290 conservative leaders, representing 180 national think tanks, state think tanks, public interest legal groups, grassroots and pro-family groups, ministries and volunteer service organizations, academic institutions, corporations and business groups, and state and local government offices, assembled to discuss methods for returning federally usurped powers to the states and the people.<p>
	At 1995's Resource Bank meeting, entitled "A Time for Leading," we celebrated an exciting new political environment where ideas thought unrealistic just months before were being discussed as serious options.  Bob Dole had called for the abolition of four federal agencies, the flat tax was miraculously on the table, Joycelyn Elders had been run out of office, and Mario Cuomo and Ann Richards were selling Doritos corn chips. <p> 
	Well, no one said it would be easy, but, in retrospect, perhaps the conservative movement was a bit overly optimistic.  We may have turned the corner in our fight against liberalism, but we have a long way to go. We do have new intellectual ammunition at our disposal, though.  The emergence of the idea of devolution, of returning powers to the states and the people, presents the conservative movement a great opportunity to go on the offensive against big centralized government. <p>
The concept of devolution, and the related concepts of federalism, subsidiarity, and decentralization, have long been standards in the pantheon of conservative principles.  But when federalism and devolution recently re-emerged in the national policy debate -- initially in the context of unfunded federal  mandates -- conservatives were not yet ready with a lot of practical ideas to exploit the opportunity.  Moreover, as Heritage's welfare analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/rector.htm">Robert Rector</a> points out, there is "federalism," and then there is "federalism."  Having the federal government collect taxes and hand them over to ultra-liberal state welfare agencies without a few, principled, conservative "strings" is not true federalism.<p>
The purpose of this year's Resource Bank meeting, then, was to help set the conservative agenda for devolution -- devolution from the federal government to the states, from state governments to local governments, and from all spheres of government to the people.  We plan to publish proceedings of the conference.  Watch <i>The Insider</i> for the announcement.<p>
I cannot do justice in this space to all the marvelous speakers, but here is a sample.  Indianapolis Mayor Stephen Goldsmith spoke of the challenges he has faced in reforming entrenched bureaucracy whose highest priority is its own survival.  Virginia Secretary of Natural Resources Becky Norton Dunlop described how Virginia fought EPA dictates concerning emission testing systems, proving that states <i>can</i> successfully resist federal micromanagement.  California Director of Social Services Eloise Anderson recounted her struggles to fashion a welfare system that promotes individual self-sufficiency in family and community, rather than dependency on the morally bankrupt welfare state.  Activist Susan Mitchell described how she and other Wisconsin school choice advocates led a diverse coalition in a sophisticated campaign to devolve control over education to parents and communities.  Kids Hope USA Executive Director Virgil Gulker spoke movingly of his work leading individual believers in evangelical churches to minister personally to at-risk kids. National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship President Steve Mariotti outlined his program's success at launching inner-city children on enterpreneurial careers, by teaching them how to start and run their own businesses.<p>
These are the people and programs that will make devolution happen.  State-friendly partners in the federal government are necessary allies, but we will be waiting a long time for Washington to decentralize itself.  The Enumerated Powers and Tenth Amendment Enforcement Acts currently before Congress, for example, will have much better chances for passage if our friends in Congress hear from the heartland. Indeed, true devolution, true federalism, a truly free and responsible society will not occur unless we the people and the states demand it, step up to our own responsibilities, and lead the way.
It was, after all, the people and the states who authorized the federal government, not the other way around.  Moreover, the federal leviathan grew not only as a result of federal usurpation but also as a result of abdication by the states and the people -- in exchange for phantom perks and promises. If the new citizenship movement is any sign, perhaps Americans are finally learning -- the hard way --  that every time we abdicate a little piece of responsibility that is rightfully ours, we lose a little piece of freedom too.<p>
	It will take an historic coalition, The States and The People, to return America to her constitutional principles of federalism, limited government, and accountability in government. "The states" and "the people" are the two parties to whom the Tenth Amendment reserves the "powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution." It is up to us to rein in government.  We have our work cut out for usand worthy work it is.

<i><font size=3>Heriatge Lecture</font></i><font size=3 face="Times New Roman">
 No. 557, The Heritage Foundation</font>

<p><font size=3>
Edwin J. Feulner, Jr., President of The Heritage Foundation, outlines a conservative internationalist foreign policy that is anchored in the foundation of vital American interests. In his introduction, Dr. Feulner defines those vital interests as developments that could concretely affect the security or economic future of America and its citizens immediately. Feulner discusses specific failures of President Clinton's interventionist strategy and points out that humanitarian interventions and other experiments have diverted attention from key items on the American foreign policy agenda, including: bilateral relations with Russia; China and its increasing hostility in East Asia; Iran, which has engaged in clandestine nuclear efforts as well as terrorism exportation; NATO, whose future has become entangled with Bosnia; missile defense, which has been dismissed as unnecessary by the administration; and the promotion of free trade, most notably the failure to expand NAFTA to include Chile. Overall, Feulner argues that when America's vital interests are served, so are the values of political and economic freedom worldwide. He lists the following as America's most vital interests: 1) safeguarding U.S. national security; 2) preventing a major power threat to Europe, East Asia, and the Persian Gulf; 3) maintaining access to foreign trade; 4) protecting Americans against threats to their lives and well-being; and 5) maintaining access to resources. 8 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail Insider@heritage.org.

The Chemical Weapons Convention: A Bad Deal for America, </a>

<i><font size=3>Committee Brief </font></i><font size=3 face="Times New Roman">
No. 25, The Heritage Foudnation</font>
<p><font size=3>

Baker Spring, Senior Defense Policy Analyst at The Heritage Foundation, surveys the decades-long effort to ban chemical weapons in anticipation of an extensive chemical weapons convention soon to be considered by the world powers. He argues that in order for any convention to deserve the support of the Senate, the agreement, as with all other arms control agreement, must pass a five part test: 1) will the convention reduce the risk of war?; 2) are the convention's requirements consistent with America's global responsibilities?; 3) is the convention adequately verifiable?; 4) are the provisions of the convention enforceable?; and 5) does the convention enhance U.S. national security? Spring lays out three principles for effective counter-proliferation of chemical weapons, including the need to deter a chemical attack,  the need for defenses against chemical weapons, and the need for offensive capabilities. 11 pp.  CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail Insider@heritage.org.

<p><font size=3>
Jonathan Clarke, Research Fellow in Foreign Policy Studies at the Cato Institute, argues that the Administration's failure to address vital interests has created a vacuum in U.S. foreign policy. He writes that while the Administration has strived to change conditions in Haiti, Ulster and Bosnia, it has ignored enhancing relations with Russia, China, Western Europe, and Japan. The recent bombings by the Irish Republican Army and Hamas, according to Clarke, have proven the instability of the peace that the administration claims to have secured in the respective regions of Northern Ireland and the Middle East. And even if the administration's claims are accepted at face value, continues Clarke, regions such as Bosnia, Northern Ireland and Haiti have little relevance to America's vital interests. Interests that include relations with crucial nations such as Russia, China, Japan, and the West European powers and are in disarray. Clarke concludes by writing that the vacuum created by ignoring what should be the epicenter of foreign policy cannot be compensated by miscellaneous policy successes on peripheral foreign policy matters. 17 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC  20001, 202/842-0200, fax 202/842-3490, <a href="mailto:cato@cato.org">E-mail cato@cato.org</a>, Internet

<b><font size=3>Russia: State Duma Election Observation Report, </font></b><br>

<p><font size=3>

The International Republican Institute sponsored a 22-member delegation to observe Russia's State Duma elections held December 17, 1995. This report relays the findings and observations of the delegation and their recommendations for future improvement in Russia's electoral process. First, they recommend that the secret ballot be practiced even though open voting (voting outside of the booth) is customary for Russians. In general, they recommend that the counting process become more secure. Counters should be better trained and tabulation process should be better organized to close opportunities for vote manipulation. Finally, the military involvement at some voting sites had the potential to create military influence over voting. The report also contains a survey of the major political parties, delegate observations on electoral environment and administration, delegate reports from the 10 cities monitored, exit poll results, and lists of new State Duma deputies. 121 pp.  CONTACT: International Republican Institute, Suite 900, 1212 New York Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20005-3987, 202/408-9450, fax 202/408-9462, <a href="mailto:IRI@access.digex.net">e-mail IRI@access.digex.net</a>.

Is There a "Clinton Crunch"?: How the 1993 Budget Plan Affected the Economy</a>,

No. 1078, The Heritage Foundation</font>
<p><font size=3>
This recent paper, by Heritage analysts William Beach, Scott Hodge, John Barry, Joe Cobb, and Mark Wilson, helps show why there is widespread dissatifaction among Americans about the nation's economic performance, despite relatively good economic figures such as low interest rates, inflation and unemployment. Using the Washington University Macro Model (WUMM)-a major economic model of the U.S. economy also used by the federal government and many Fortune 500 companies-economists at the Heritage Foundation investigated how the economy would likely be performing today had Congress not raised taxes in 1993 as the nation was coming out of the 1990-1991 recession. According to their analysis, the 1993 tax hike, supported by the President, did produce what has come to be known as the "Clinton Crunch." The "Clinton Crunch" is the economic situation in which there is a larger tax bill for families combined with a stagnation in incomes and an economy that is performing well below its potential. They found that the 1993 Budget had the following effects on the U.S. economy: 1) economic growth has been slowed by $208 billion; 2) the pace of business formation has been slowed by over 40,000 new businesses; 3) job growth has been slowed by 1.2 million jobs; 4) the growth in household income and savings has been cut; and 5) the reduction in the deficit attributable to the 1993 plan has been small. Removing the effect of the 1993 budget, using WUMM, shows that the economy would have been performing significantly better today had the legislation not been enacted. 23 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail Insider@heritage.org.

<b><font size=3>Private Cures for Public Ills: The Promise of Privatization, </font></b><br>

<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">The Foundation for Economic Education</font><br>
<p><font size=3>
In his introduction, Lawrence Reed, President of the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, praises the retreat of statism in American public policy. However, he points out the ravages of its influence are still with us: "bloated, overbearing bureaucracies; crushing tax burdens; deficits and debt swallowing huge chunks of public budgets." Reed argues that privatization is the cure for public sector waste, fraud and inefficiency. With a foreword by Michigan Governor John Engler, this collection of twenty-six  essays supporting privatization includes contributions from: Hans Sennholz, President of The Foundation for Economic Education; Doug Bandow, Senior Fellow at the Cato Institute; Burton Folsom, Senior Fellow at the Mackinac Center; Clint Bolick, Director of Litigation at the Institute for Justice; and several other authors. The essays are grouped into six sections; 1) the privatizing idea; 2) downsizing the federal bureaucracy; 3) transportation and highways; 4) private property and environmentalism; 5) rethinking "public" services; and 6) the challenge ahead.  202 pp. CONTACT: The Foundation for Economic Education, 30 South Broadway, Irvington-on-Hudson, NY  10533, 914/591-7230, fax 914/591-8910.

This issue centers on the topic of privatization. In the first article, Editor Kerry Jackson illustrates how several states have implemented privatization programs. Some of the most notable include: the proposed privatization of the new international arrival building and the cargo facilities at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York; the privatization of state daycare centers and some Department of Motor Vehicle functions in New Jersey; and the outsourcing of student loan processing operations in Indiana. Jackson also reports on how New Zealand used privatization to return from the brink of economic collapse and the success of prison privatization efforts in Texas. In another article the Reason Foundation puts forth a case for governments to sell off underutilized assets to offset budgetary shortfalls. 7 pp. CONTACT: American Legislative Exchange Council, 910 17th Street, N.W., 5th Floor, Washington, DC  20006, 202/466-3800, fax 202/466-3801.

Vague and complicated prevailing wage laws are important to potential government contractors because they effect who will bid on government contracts and how competitive those contracts will be. Greg Smith, Task Force Director at the American Legislative Exchange Council, explains that prevailing wage laws require government contractors to pay minimal administratively determined wages and fringe benefits to employees working on public works projects. Moreover, Smith writes that the U.S Department of Labor determines the wage on the federal level in a way that usually reflects union wages and benefits rather than market rate. State prevailing wage laws are modeled after the federal law which was enacted with the Davis-Bacon Act of 1931. Davis-Bacon was passed in order to exclude black and immigrant workers from providing cheaper labor in the place of higher paying white union labor. 5 pp. CONTACT: American Legislative Exchange Council, 910 17th Street, N.W., 5th floor, Washington, DC  20006, 202/466-3800, fax 202/466-3801.

Heritage Policy Analyst Bryan Johnson presents and then disproves the major myths concerning free trade expansion. Myth #1: Free trade has destroyed America's manufacturing base. Myth #2: High manufacturing wages must be protected from foreign competition regardless of the cost to the overall economy. Myth #3: Free trade is causing America to lose its technological edge. Myth #4: Trade deficits are harmful while trade surpluses are beneficial. Myth #5: Trade deficits cost jobs. Myth #6: Japan's prosperity is based on trade surpluses generated by managed trade policies. Myth #7: American companies will go bankrupt unless the U.S. government limits import competition and forces foreign countries to purchase more U.S. goods. Myth #8: Countries like Japan are called protectionist simply because the U.S. has experienced difficulty penetrating their markets. Myth #9: Trade surpluses are always the result of government policy. Myth #10: Trade retaliation is the most effective way to open foreign markets. And Myth #11: International trade arrangements like the World Trade Organization and the North American Free Trade Area violate American sovereignty. 11 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail Insider@heritage.org.<br>

Daniel Mitchell, McKenna Senior Fellow in Political Economy at The Heritage Foundation, illustrates the ins and outs of the flat tax. He begins by explaining what the flat tax is, then moves on to discuss its advantages. Mitchell also provides an easy model from which the reader may calculate their tax bill and then illustrates how today's tax system is anti-growth and anti-family. A state-by-state summary of a flat tax's potential impact is included, which shows how the flat tax would renew the American job creation machine and help homeowners-despite the warnings of skeptics. Mitchell also illustrates how a flat tax would positively control the deficit, how it would help seniors, and how it would save social security. He concedes in his conclusion that the one question that the book does not answer about the flat tax is how it will be achieved. The reader is reminded of how much power politicians wield as a result of their ability to tinker with the tax code to benefit special interests. The book includes a preface by Jack Kemp and an introduction by Senator Richard Shelby. 60 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail Insider@heritage.org.

This line-by-line analysis of Michigan's 1995-96 state budget reflects a principled vision for Michigan culture, according to the authors, by asking this question about each budget item: Should this program or activity be done by the authority of the state and financed by taxation, or should it be done by its individual citizens acting in voluntary cooperation and private contract with one another? The study recommends over $2 billion in spending reductions (over 7% of the state budget) achieved by eliminating unnecessary and counterproductive programs, rolling back unjustified program growth, and contracting out for services that can be handled more efficiently by the private sector.  97 pp. CONTACT: The Mackinac Center for Public Policy, 119 Ashman St., P.O.

The new Congress took charge in January of 1995 and promised to close and consolidate redundant and obsolete government agencies. Ronald Utt, Visiting Fellow at the Heritage Foundation, examines the progress that has been made on these promises. Overall, he finds that in a sharp contrast to past years, Congress actually followed through on its promises and achieved more than expected. They shut down 270 agencies, divisions, offices, and programs throughout the federal government. Utt points out that while Congress has done its part to reduce government waste, only about $600 million of the $5.8 billion in potential savings has been signed into law by the President. He concludes that it is obvious that tremendous progress has been made in cutting wasteful, obsolete, and redundant federal programs, however, he urges that Congress and the President revisit many of the independent agencies that survived and make additional cuts as appropriate.  20 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail Insider@heritage.org.<br>

<b><font size=3>The Decline of Welfare in Wisconsin, <br></font></b>

<i><font size=3>Report</font></i><font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman"> 
Vol. 9, No. 3, Wisconsin Policy Research Institute</font>
<p><font size=3>
Lawrence Mead, Visiting Professor in Public Policy at Princeton, examines the decline of welfare in Wisconsin. Between 1987, when Governor Tommy Thompson came into office, and 1994, the state of Wisconsin cut its welfare rolls (Aid to Families with Dependent Children, or AFDC) by 23 percent, much more than any other state. Liberals claim the drop in the caseload has to do with Wisconsin's thriving economy, not necessarily the efforts by the Thompson administration to reform welfare. Mead's paper shows otherwise. He says that the economy played a part, but that it was the welfare reforms, especially the implementation of the Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Training Program (JOBS) that greatly influenced the shrinking of Wisconsin's welfare rolls. On the issue of whether the state has gained or lost money on welfare reform, Mead shows that although it has spent much more on administration and support services than before, due to the drop in the caseload, Wisconsin has saved an estimated $68 million overall.  44 pp. CONTACT: Wisconsin Policy Research Institute, 3107 North Shepard Avenue, Milwaukee, WI 53221, 414/963-0600, fax 414/963-4230.

<p><font size=3>

Genevieve Young, a Washington, D.C. attorney, illustrates how advocates for government-controlled health care have reformulated their strategy by sneaking their agenda through state capitals and into schoolhouses. She reports on a recent investigation sponsored by the Pennsylvania General Assembly to see how the state's public school system was being used to provide health programs for students and their families. The investigation found that several district's school based-health clinics were already providing extensive health services. The Pennsylvania General Assembly had no previous knowledge of, nor had it given consent to, the establishment and funding of such services. Young shows that legislatures are also discovering that programs and proposals that claim to be intended for America's children actually represent a renewed assault on private health care. Further investigation into the issue has revealed that state education reform programs have become the road to health reform, and that state agencies and private foundations have been the forces behind enacting Clinton Administration health care proposals through a back door. Young calls for Congress and legislatures to re-examine how children have become pawns in political struggles over power and money, and how healthcare reform, defeated in Congress, is being implemented under the guise of "education reform." 7 pp.  CONTACT: Capital Research Center, 727 15th Street, N.W., 8th Floor, Washington, DC 20005, 202/393-2600, fax 202/393-2626.

<p><font size=3>
According to this paper, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in its current form is inefficient and a "prototypical centralized, bureaucratic regulatory agency." Furthermore, the most significant cost of FDA's inefficiency is human, as America's outmoded medical regulatory process directly results in jobs being exported abroad and denies new medical technology to patients that need them much sooner than unnecessary delays allow. The Progress and Freedom Foundation has developed a replacement model for medical technology regulation that is designed to ensure the safety and effectiveness of medical products while providing patients with faster access to new treatments. The Progress and Freedom proposal offers competitive forces in order to eliminate the "regulatory creep" inherent in monopolies such as the FDA. While maintaining the existing legal requirements for safety and effectiveness and even the FDA stamp of approval, the plan relies on nongovernmental bodies to review and certify new medical products. 116 pp. CONTACT: The Progress & Freedom Foundation, 1301 K Street, N.W.

Denis Doyle, Heritage Foundation Visiting Fellow in Education, and Christine Olson, Heritage Policy Analyst, write that, the only overriding federal responsibility in education is to guarantee the constitutional right of all Americans, while acknowledging that Washington is also better equipped than the states to collect and display educational data than all the states and localities. However, as far as management of classroom instruction and curriculum, the federal government is suitable for little more than offering advice. Doyle and Olson outline The Back to Basics Education Reform Act (H.R. 1883), which seeks to eliminate the Department of Education within one year of enactment. They also look at another proposal to merge DOE with the Department of Labor and the EEOC. Overall, they conclude that Americans no longer support major federal solutions to quintessentially local problems.

The Center for Education Reform</font>
<p><font size=3>
Charles Sykes, Senior Fellow at the Wisconsin Policy Research Institute, illustrates the current crisis in American schools: Americans rank at the bottom of international tests in math and science; national reading scores continue to fall; and despite massive increases in spending, American schools continue to produce students who lack basic skills and knowledge. Sykes writes that the reaction within the education establishment to the decline in test scores has been to lower standards, and that what has triumphed is a "mediocre, feel good education that is more concerned with pumping self-esteem than it is with passing on knowledge." Sykes traces the roots of these educational fads to their current state today. He also discusses the following: why American students test poorly in language, math and science when compared with peers from other countries; why "self-esteem" has supplanted grades and genuine achievements in American schools; how the education teachers' unions and school boards lower standards while continuing to raise budgets and taxes; and how curriculum and standard tests are being dumbed down so everyone can pass but no one can excel. Sykes concludes the book with a checklist for parents, teachers and students who want to evaluate their schools, and a series of recommendations to restore the quality standards for learning. 339 pp. CONTACT: The Center for Education Reform, 1001 Connecticut Avenue, N.W.

<b><font size=3>Why South Carolina Should Drop Out of Goals 2000,

<P><font size=3>
Sheldon Richman, Vice President of Policy Affairs at the Future of Freedom Foundation, calls for South Carolina to drop out of Goals 2000. He examines each of Goals 2000's "goals" and shows how they will lead to more federal government intrusion, and ultimately federal control of curriculum, teaching practices, and even facilities. Richman warns that non-compliance with "voluntary" Goals 2000 directives could lead to litigation against states and local school districts. Significantly, some states-Montana, Alabama, California, Virginia, and New Hampshire-have already dropped out or refused funding because of "too many strings" attached to the funding and participation. In illustrating South Carolina's experience with Goals 2000, Richman notes that local educators and elected boards are losing their freedom to set agendas, to teach in the way they find effective, and to monitor their own progress. Richman concludes that Goals 2000 is: based on the flawed belief that all children and teachers are interchangeable; based on an unsound model of education looking at schools as factories; and based on the flawed view that bureaucratic government monopoly is public spirited and benign. 16 pp. CONTACT: South Carolina Policy Council Education Foundation, 1419 Pendleton Street, Columbia, SC  29201, 803/779-5022, fax 803/779-4953.

If the state of Michigan takes from a land owner some, but not all, of the use or value of his land, the owner is not entitled to any compensation. This forces a few land owners to bear the entire cost of these "takings" that are intended to benefit the public as a whole. Many states have initiated reforms that would permit land owners to be more fairly compensated. This study outlines the practice of takings jurisprudence in Michigan, reviews the legislative responses in Michigan and other states, and makes specific recommendations for reform. 34 pp. CONTACT: The Mackinac Center for Public Policy, 119 Ashman St., P.O.

<b><font size=3>Finding Fault with No-Fault Divorce Laws:
A Policy Paper from Focus on the Family, <br></font></b>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">by Glenn Stanton<p>
Focus on the Family</font>
<p><font size=3>
Glenn Stanton, Social Research Analyst at Focus on the Family, illustrates that the no-fault divorce revolution-once touted by the women's liberation movement-has proven to be a failure. Starting with a brief history of divorce law in the United States, Stanton moves into a history of the no-fault movement, which started in California in 1969 and brought some form of no-fault law to the other forty-nine states by 1985. According to Stanton, the no-fault reformers had four goals: 1) to lower the already increasing divorce rate; 2) to foster greater equality between men and women; 3) to improve the lives of women and children; and 4) to expand individual choice and happiness. Stanton examines each one of these goals and shows that no-fault has had the exact opposite of the intended effects. The study concludes with policy recommendations. First, divorce laws should work to preserve the institution of marriage, and should give more balance to the rights of the party that desires to preserve the marriage. Next, couples who both agree they want to dissolve their marriages without having to show fault should face a substantial waiting period  before the divorce is granted. Also, division of property should be tied to fault. To change the current overwhelming disregard for the effects that divorce has on children, Stanton argues that the needs and desires of the parent should not override those of the children, which are, as a rule, the participation of both parents in their upbringing. Overall, Stanton believes that, divorce laws should make it more attractive to invest in marriage instead of divorce.  12 pp. CONTACT: Focus on the Family, 8605 Explorer Drive, Colorado Springs, CO 80920, 719/531-3400, fax 719/548-4525.

<b>CIR Reaches Successful Settlement in <i>Henry Painting Co. v. Ohio State University 
</i></b><br><font size=3>
CIR represents Jerry Henry, the white owner of Henry Painting Co., who, until 1986, regularly contracted with Ohio State University ("OSU") to perform painting contracts. However, since 1986, Henry Painting has been excluded from the bidding process because OSU has reserved all painting contracts for minority-owned businesses pursuant to a 100% set-aside program. That set aside program, in turn, was OSU's implementation of the Ohio State Minority Business Act, a state law requiring all state agencies to set aside 15% of all contracts for minority-owned businesses. Because OSU could not locate any minority bidders in other areas, it contrived to reach its 15% goal by reserving all of its painting contracts exclusively for minorities.<p>
In 1994, CIR, on behalf of Henry, brought suit against OSU challenging the constitutionality of OSU's set-aside practices. The lawsuit ended when the parties signed a binding judicial consent decree.  Under the consent decree, the State of Ohio agreed to an injunction against "considering race, color, national origin, gender, social or economic disadvantage, or any factor other than standard State procurement policies and practices, in awarding painting contracts at [OSU]."  OSU also agreed to pay the plaintiff $368,000 in damages and attorneys fees.
<p><b>CIR Challenges the Constitutionality of the 1994 Violence Against Women Act</b><br>
CIR is assisting in the defense of Antonio Morrison, a Virginia Tech student-athlete. Mr. Morrison, along with two other individuals and Virginia Tech, is named in a lawsuit filed by Christy Brzonkala, a student at the University. The lawsuit contains state and federal claims stemming from her alleged rape by Mr. Morrison and a codefendant in September 1994. Of importance to CIR is Brzonkala's attempt to impose civil and criminal liability upon Mr. Morrison under the so-called Violence Against Women Act ("VAWA").  CIR is arguing that VAWA represents an illegitimate exercise of Congressional power.<p>
Congress purported to pass VAWA pursuant to its authority under the Commerce Clause and Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.  CIR contends that VAWA exceeds Congressional power under the Commerce Clause as defined by the Supreme Court in <i>United States v. Lopez</i>.<p>
A grand jury, after hearing testimony by the police, refused to indict Mr. Morrison for any criminal violation.<br><p>

<b>CIR Reaches Successful Settlement in<i> Doe v. United States</i></b>

Although Doe possessed strong academic credentials, Camp Planet Earth rejected her simply because of race. CIR brought suit against various state entities, including Texas A&M University, which operated the racially discriminatory summer science camp program, and the National Science Foundation. Doe has settled with the state entities and the federal government.  In addition to paying damages and attorneys' fees: 1) the state defendants agreed to discontinue any discriminatory practices on the basis of race, color, national origin, or ethnicity in selecting applicants for Camp Planet Earth; and 2) the federal defendants agreed to take reasonable steps to prevent discrimination by any summer science camp receiving funds from the National Science Foundation. Recent correspondence from Texas A&M indicates that it no longer wishes to operate Camp Planet Earth.<br></font><p>

<b><font size=4>DEFENDERS OF PROPERTY RIGHTS</font></b>
<p>
<b>Endangered Species Act is Before the Supreme Court </b>
<br>
Defenders of Property Rights is preparing a brief <i>amicus curiae</i>in the case of <i>Bennett v. Plenert</i>, requesting that the United States Supreme Court reverse the decision of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in that case. At issue is whether plaintiffs asserting an interest other than preservation of endangered species may sue the government for violating the procedures established by the Endangered Species Act ("ESA").<p> 

Plaintiffs in this case are two individual ranchers and two irrigation districts located in the state of Oregon. They filed a "citizens suit" challenging a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biological opinion that concluded that the preservation of the endangered Lost River sucker and shortnose sucker (species of fish) requires that the water level in two reservoirs be maintained at a designated minimum level.  The plaintiffs who use the reservoirs' water for commercial and recreational purposes, claim the government violated certain provisions of the ESA by neglecting to consider the economic impact caused by its finding that the reservoirs were critical habitats for the fish.<p>
	
In affirming the lower court's dismissal of plaintiffs' complaint, the Ninth Circuit Court astonishingly held that "only plaintiffs who allege an interest in the preservation of endangered species" may bring citizen suits under the ESA.  The ranchers and irrigation districts, the court held, did not fall within this category. "To the contrary," the court wrote, "they claim a competing interestan interest in using the very water that the government believes is necessary for the preservation of the species."  Because the ranchers' and irrigation districts' interests in the water were solely economic and recreational, the court held that they could not sue to force the government to comply with the ESA.  The court held thus, notwithstanding that it was "aware that the ESA specifically provides that the government should consider a variety of factorsincluding economic onesin designing critical habitat for a species."<p>
	
This Ninth Circuit opinion is the legacy of the last term's <i>Sweet Home </i> case, where the U.S. Supreme Court stated that the ESA's citizen suit provision was designed to further the goal of species protection by allowing "interested persons" to sue to enforce the ESA."  As well as quoting from the Sweet Home case, the Ninth Circuit also cited with approval the 1978 Supreme Court case <i>Tennessee Valley Authority v. Hill</i>, wherein the Court had earlier concluded "[T]he plain intent of Congress in enacting [the ESA] was to halt and reverse the trend toward extinction, whatever the cost."

<b><i>Terry L. and Gayle E. Beardslee v. Crawford County Road Commission</i></b>
<br>
On July 19, 1994, Terry and Gayle Beardslee awoke to find a bulldozer belonging to the Crawford County Road Commission on their forty acres of woodlands in upstate Michigan. Without notice, public hearing, or offer of compensation, the county bulldozer proceeded to destroy hundreds of the Beardslee's trees, shrubs, and other landscaping to clear an abandoned and overgrown logging trail that the county decided to claim as public highway.<p>

When the Beardslee's bought the property in 1989, neither the title insurance policy nor a survey of the land indicated a claim to the trail that diagonally traversed their property.  Impassable in many places, they erected barriers and posted no trespassing signs at both ends of the trail.<p>

In the process of improving this proposed road, the county expanded the eight-to-ten foot wide trail to fifteen feet. An attorney retained by the Beardslees advised them that no documents of record give the county any public right-of-way across their property.
<p>

<b>Milwaukee School Choice</b><br>
On March 29, 1996, the Wisconsin Supreme Court deadlocked 3 to 3 on the Milwaukee school choice case, and sent the case back to the trial court for a decision.  Three justices decided against the program because of a violation of the Wisconsin Constitution, including the state establishment clause.  They did not reach a decision on whether the program violated the Establishment Clause under the U.S. Constitution or the First Amendment issue. The other three justices believe the program is constitutional in all respects.  Of the three justices against the program, one is retiring and a new justice was recently elected to replace him.

<b>Property Rights in Michigan's Upper Peninsula</b>
<br>
In a nationally-significant case regarding the ability of the U.S. Forest Service to manage private property as wilderness, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit granted MSLF's petition for a rehearing en banc. The Court also vacated an earlier decision by a three judge panel upholding the authority of the Forest Service.
<p>
Lake front property owners in the Upper Penisula of Michigan have been denied their right to use the entire surface of Crooked Lakea right recognized by Michigan Lawby U.S. Forest Service regulation. The Forest Service asserts that since it owns property abutting the southern portion of the Lake, it may regulate the Lake. The Forest Servie claims the Property Clause of the Constitution gives it such authority over private property even though Congress specifically excluded private property from wilderness designation or management.

<b>MSLF Challenges Federal Race-Based Set Aside</b>

On behalf of George Keritsis, a white male of Greek ancestry, sole shareholder and President of Southern Cad/Cam, Inc., (SCC) a turnkey supplier of personal computers and related products and services, MSLF has challenged the use, by the United States Army, of Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act to restrict bids on electronic computer equipment and software to certain racial groups. Despite SCC's submittal of the lowest bid, the contract was awarded to the next higher bidder because of Mr. Keritsis' race. The next highest bid was more than half a million dollars greater than that submitted by SCC.

<b>Air Force Base Converison Victory Upheld</b><br>

The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in Boston has affirmed a lower court decision allowing continued leasing at the site of the former Pease Air Force Base.  This decision keeps New Hampshire's largest source of new civilian jobs on track. NELF has represented the Greater Portsmouth Chamber of Commerce and two other business groups since 1992 when an environmental group brought suit to block the federal government's sale of Pease to a state agency set up to convert the base to commercial use. NELF and the New Hampshire business community strongly support Pease as a key element in the state's ongoing return to economic health. Some national environmental groups had proposed using litigation threats to block conversion of military bases in order to coerce concesssions from state and federal governments.  By rejecting their case here, the court struck a blow against the plan.

<b>Brown University Title IX Case Argued in Court of Appeals</b><br>
Brown University has argued its appeal of use of Title IX to micromanage the university's athletic programs.  The case is a key test of how willing courts will be to use anti-discrimination laws as the basis for strict quotas.  On behalf of several national associations of coaches and athletes, NELF argued that Brown has provided equal athletic opportunities for both sexes and the different number of male and female intercollegiate athletes reflects student interests beyond the schools control.

<b>U.S. Supreme Court Decides <i>O'Connor v. Consolidated Coin</i>Case</b>
<br>
In a defeat for the business community, the U.S. Supreme Court has held that virtually any worker over 40 years of age, replaced by a younger person, can bring a "prima facie" age discrimination claim, even if a replacement is also over 40. The Court reversed a lower court decision NELF had supported, which held that a plaintiff could only take advantage of "prima facie" inference if the replacement came from outside the protected class. The decision did leave open a ray of hope, noting the case might have come out differently if age difference had been "insignificant."

<b>Certiorari Denied in <i>Leger</i> and <i>NARPO</i></b><br>

While denial of certiorari has no precedential significance, it means that these cases are at an end.

<b>Court Says 'No' To Arbitrary Fees For Landowners</b>
<br>
For several years, Richard Ehrlich operated a private tennis club but was unable to make a financial success of it. In 1988, he closed the facility and donated most of the movable equipment to the city and proposed a townhouse condominium project on the property. The City Council approved the project on condition that Mr. Ehrlich pay $280,000, which the city estimated was the cost of building replacement tennis courts. They also demanded that he pay over $33,000 for public art.
<p>
PLF argued that the fees are unconstitutional for failing the "rough proportionality" test laid down in <i>Dolan v. City of Tigard</i>. Conditions for a permit are justifiable only if local officials can show that there is a reasonable connection or essential "nexus" between the conditions and any harm caused by the project being permitted. The extent of the exations must also be "roughly proportional" to the project's impact on the community. The <i>Ehrlich</i> case differs in that the property owner is being asked to come up with cash instead of land.<p>

Citing PLF's victories in <i>Dolan</i> and <i>Nollan v. California Coastal Commission</i>, the state Supreme Court held that local bureaucrats cannot arbitrarily and capriciously shift the cost of public projects on private landowners in the form of development fees. 
<p>
Unfortunately, the court did not go far enough. Under the court's equivical reasoning, the tough standards established in <i>Nollan</i> and <i>Dolan</i> now apply to some, but not all, fees imposed on land use approvals. In other words, bureaucrats are subject to scrutiny only when property owners have to individually "negotiate" over terms of their particular permits.
<p>
Applying the "new" standard to Mr. Ehrlich, the state justices nevertheless ruled that he must still pay $33,220 for public art and that he must go back to the city so that the bureaucrats can have a second shot at justifying their $280,000 recreational fee.

<b>Bureaucrats Force Landowners To Sustain Economic Losses</b>
<br>
Leon Scharf is the principle owner of a 70-year-old apartment building in New York. In February 1994, the building was ravaged by fire. What was not burned was damaged by water used to fight the blaze. Consequently, the building was no longer safe for its tenants who had to relocate. Repairing the building to habitable condition would have far exceeded its fair market value, and yet the former tenants (also beneficiaries of New York's rent control law at Mr. Scharf's expense) filed suit demanding that the building be rebuilt so that their protected tenancies may be resumed.
<p>
New York's special Housing Court agreed that repairs would cost more than the market value of the building after restoration. However, the court ruled that this fact "was not dispositive." Instead, it held that Mr. Scharf had a "duty" to restore the property and that the tenants were "entitled" to have "their" apartment building restored. According to the court, it is Mr. Scharfnot the public as a wholewho must satisfy the city's need for affordable housing. 
<p>
In short, Mr. Scharf is being forced into a course of action guaranteed to cause a substantial loss of economically viable use of his property, not simply because the cost of restoration exceeds the fair market value itself has been severly depressed in the first place by the regulatory regime on New York's rent control laws. Pacific Legal Foundation argued to a New York appellate court that the government's demand that he repair this uninhabitable building is an unconstitutional regulatory "taking" of his property.

<b>SLF Attempts Intervention in Voting Rights Act Lawsuit Against State of Georgia</b>
<br>
On behalf of an elected member of the Georgia General Assembly, a candidate for office, and a Georgia voter, SLF has waded into the legislative redistricting battle underway in Georgia. SLF contends that Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, which empowers the U.S. Department of Justice to "pre-clear" any voting district changes in 16, mostly Southern, states is an unconstitutional usurpation of judicial power by the executive branch.
<p>
In its effort to challenge the outdated pre-clearance section of the Act, SLF attempted to intervene in a pending lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Justice against the State of Georgia for its most recent state redistricting efforts, which demanded that Georgia instead use its 1992 legislative map. The 1992 map has come under intense scrutiny by the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in a separate but related action underway since 1994 for its use of race as a sole criteria for legislative redistricting.
<p>
Attempting to intervene before the same three-judge court which is hearing the legislative redistricting case, SLF asked the court to enter its clients as co-defendants in the action, arguing that the citizens of Georgia have standing to raise constitutional questions not raised by the State defendants. In early April, the three-judge court in Atlanta granted provisional intervention status to SLF's clients. Within a week the Court had withdrawn the status, reasoning that SLF's claims were "too remote." SLF is currently preparing a direct appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court under the Voting Rights Act on the issue of intervention status of citizens to challenge the pre-clearance section of the Voting Rights Act.

<b>SEC Urged to Recognize Self-Audit Privilege</b>
<br>
WLF filed a petition for rulemaking with the Securities and Exchange Commission urging the agency to adopt a policy against using a company's internal evaluations or self-audits in enforcement actions. Such self-audits are a tool that companies use to strengthen their compliance with federal securities laws. WLF argued that SEC policy should reflect that self-audits by companies are indispensable to the SEC's efforts in maintaining compliance with those laws.
<p>
WLF argued that the SEC should insititute a broad privilege of confidentiality for firms' self-critical evaluations or audits that lead to the correction of improper activity. According to commentators, the SEC "is increasingly requesting production in its investigations of routine internal audit reports and reports of special investigations." The petition states that the SEC has created a powerful barrier to self-critical initiatives by failing to recognize such a privilege.
<p>
WLF Asks Supreme Court to Reject State Suits on FDA-Approved Medical Devices
In <i>Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr</i>, WLF filed a brief in the U.S. Supreme Court arguing that state-law suits claiming injuries caused by FDA-approved medical devices are impermissible because they are pre-empted by federal law. WLF argued that, given the extensive regulation of medical device design and marketing by the FDA, permitting still more regulation at the state level (in the form of lawsuits) would discourage development of new and useful medical devices. WLF further argued that the plain language of the 1976 amendments to the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act indicates that Congress intended to preempt state product liability suits against a medical device manufacturer that has complied with FDA labeling and manufacturing requirements. The <i>Medtronic</i> case is being watched closely by the business community, because it will provide a strong indication of the High Court's willingness to bar state-law suits against manufacturers whose products are already subject to significant federal regulation. 
<br><p>
<b>Regulators Must Prove Knowledge of Clean Water Act Violations</b>
<br>
WLF filed a brief in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in <i>United States v. Ahmad</i>, urging the court to overturn a criminal conviction under the Clean Water Act because the district court refused to instruct the jury that the government must prove that the defendant had knowledge of all the elements of the offense. Alternatively, WLF asked the court to set aside the unduly harsh 21-month prison sentence for the first offender because the Sentencing Guidelines for environmental infractions were unlawfully promulgated by the Sentencing Commission and are otherwise flawed.
<p>
WLF argued in its brief that Congress intended that "knowing" violations require the government to prove knowledge of all the elements of the offense. WLF urged the Court to follow the Fourth Circuit which requires a higher intent standard than the Ninth Circuit's lower standard recently enunciated in <i>United States v. Weitzenhoff</i>.

<h3>In Focus: Book Review</h3>
</center><p>
<i>Temptations of a Superpower</i><br>
by Ronald Steel, Cambridge University Press 1995
<hr>
<p>
In his latest work, <i>Temptations of a Superpower</i>, Ronald Steel scores against what he views as a U.S. foreign policy that has outlived its usefulness, taking a brief, but well-targeted, stab at the present foreign policy dilemma of the United States.  What role should America play in the post-Cold War international arena?  Should the U.S. move toward an interventionist strategy, or pull back into an isolationist position?  Mr. Steel, Professor of International Relations at the University of Southern California and author of <i>Walter Lippman and the American Century</i>, skillfully dissects the underlying principles that served as the pillars of American Cold War foreign policy, while pointing out that new ones are needed.<p>

He begins by undermining the widely accepted notion that the United States "won" the Cold War, questioning whether the United States has come to a position as world leader by its own design or purely by default. With the absence of a great power as an opponent,  Steel argues that the U.S. role as superpower has lost its onus.  With global conflicts changing from quarrels between nation-states to intra-state ethnic and religious disputes, the former policies aimed at containment are becoming increasingly outdated.  He states: "Now we are alone:  a superpower without a challenger, a crusader without a mission."  The rules of the game are changing, but the United States continues to dance singly to the tune of the Cold War, at the risk of sacrificing significant domestic concerns and endangering the nation's pocketbook.
<p>
Wilsonian ideas, such as collective security and self-determination, combined with an entrenched, elitist bureaucracy are competing with Cold War goals, methods, and attitudes, writes Steel. Though alliance-building can serve well in situations involving only nation-states, Steel believes that collective security will only escalate today's smaller, yet complex, intra-state conflicts into regional problems. Furthermore, Steel asserts that the idea of self-determination is so impossibly open-ended that, even after years of debate, it cannot translate into practical foreign policy.  However well-intentioned it may be, it is rooted in the basic assumption that differing people cannot live together, an idea completely contrary to the American experience.  
<p>
The foreign policy "establishment" must also be addressed, according to Steel.  These estranged bureaucrats, hidden away from public scrutiny, have agendas and perspectives all their own.  They make their livings off of a bureaucratic organism that gorged itself on tax dollars (and continues to do so) during the Cold War, and now, even without the need for such monstrous budgets, they strive to maintain this behemoth in a symbiotic effort to preserve their own jobs. Steel believes that these "experts" have become ends unto themselves, and no longer the means for creating sound foreign policy.  
<p>
Steel advises a new direction for foreign policy based principally on self-interest, without the moral baggage that has so characterized many U.S. international policies.  Promoting democracy, confronting "hostile" ideologies, or acting as moral guardian should play a lesser role in American foreign policy.  He pushes the ideas of selective engagement and benign spheres of influence.  With specific guidelines set by a principle of selective engagement, the United States would intervene globally only when its vital interests are threatened. He then relinquishes the responsibility of "conflict management" to the regions in which the conflicts occur.  For example, just as Vietnam once halted the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, so would European states themselves supervise the present situation in Bosnia. Steel believes that this regional self-accountability will more easily provide global stability than an ever-widening U.S. umbrella.
<p>
<i>Temptations of a Superpower</i> is a clearly and concisely written critique, but this published lecture is a bit brief, and lacks detail in many areas.  In addition, it is purely academic, and focuses only on description, by-passing the much needed element of prescription.  Despite this,  Steel has written a quite enjoyable and provocative work, and is well worth the few hours required to read it.

<h3>April 1996 <i>Insider</i></h3>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>Justice, Freedom, the Flat Tax, 
and the Tithe</FONT></B></CENTER>
<hr><P>
<font size=3> The last thing you should worry about when you study the matter of various flat tax 
proposals is whether it will take a 17 percent or 21 percent rate to work. From a biblical 
perspective, two far higher priorities on taxes should be the issues of justice and freedom. 
Both are recurring biblical themes, and both are terribly jeopardized by the present tax 
system in the United States. By contrast, both would be remarkably enhanced with almost 
any flat tax approach. <p>
	Complexity, almost always, is the enemy of justice. Simplicity is its friend. As soon as 
matters get complex, in virtually any venue, the opportunity for corruption takes over. When 
people cant understand a tax code, they get either cynical or opportunistic, and neither 
attitude is congenial to evenhanded justice.<p> 
	Its pretty hard, for example, to beat the simplicity of the tithe. No one can ever come to 
Gods court of appeals arguing that calculating 10 percent was just too difficult, or that he 
couldnt find a tithe consultant smart enough to figure it out.<p> 
	By the same token, its noteworthy that God never established one tithe for the wealthy and 
another for the poor and common folk. The rate was the same, and we can assume that God 
considers that arrangement just. The book of Proverbs reminds us bluntly that were not to 
use two sets of standards in any financial dealings. <p>
	To be sure, almost none of the flat tax proposals now being suggested for our country is even 
yet really equal in its application. To exempt the first $36,000 (or thereabouts) of everyones 
income before starting to apply a 17 percent tax clearly favors the poor, who under such a 
plan would pay no tax at all. And Im not persuaded yet that individual income from interest 
and dividends should be exempted from taxationan idea that will appear to many to favor 
the rich, despite the argument that this income is already taxed at the corporate level. But 
thats why I say we shouldnt get hung upup least yetin the details. The simplicity of the 
proposals tends radically toward justice, and that should be appealing to biblically minded 
folks. <p>
	The other important reason for favoring a flat tax rate is that it would promote freedom. In 
one fell swoop, the flat tax minimizes the role of government in all its attempts to 
micromanage society and culture. For far too long now have we allowed great segments of 
our public life to be driven by tax considerations. The big government social engineers tinker 
constantly with the tax code: tax incentives here, tax deductions there, write-offs for this 
desirable goal, and five-year forgiveness clauses if you take on some other cause the 
government happens to like.<p> 
	The power to tax is indeed the power to destroy, but by extension it is also the power to 
shape a societys values and idealsand in doing so to establish which freedoms will be 
promoted and which will be restricted. So it is a wise people who place simple but strong 
restraints on their governments ability to drill a million holes in the tax code.<p> 
	I say all this fully aware that my employer, World magazine, gets part of its lifeblood from 
tax-deductible gifts from readersand that such revenue might be at least a little jeopardized 
if charitable contributions are no longer tax deductible. <p>
	Not to worry! For that is the very point. As long as people make gifts, even to worthy causes, 
primarily because they are tax deductible and not because that cause is passionately 
important to them, both the tax code and the government behind it are way too important. 
Yes, we may lose a few gifts to our charitable organizationsbut in the end, both we and 
they will breathe so much more deeply of the great air of freedom that it will be a good trade.<p> 
	I have no idea whether a 17 percent flat tax or one at 21 percent will be needed to sustain our 
government through the transition that is coming. Either way, its a great bargainnot 
because of the rate, but because of where the idea ultimately takes us. <p>

<font size=3>In 1995, The Heritage Foundation created a Missile Defense Study Team, 
Team B, to look at the growing threat of ballistic missiles armed with weapons of mass 
destruction and  produced a report that recommended timely, affordable and technically
sound responses to a missile threat in the form of a missile defense system. This update
offers several new recommendations to adjust to the delays and negative developments
that have characterized the missile defense program in the past year including: <br>
<ol><li>the U.S. Senate should seek ways to remove the obstacles to effective missile
defenses posed by the ABM Treaty, including possible withdrawal from the treaty; <li>
Congress should forego development of ground-based systems for national missile 
defense and accelerate deployment of sea-based, wide-area defenses; <li>Congress
should accelerate the deployment of space-based sensors to enhance the effectiveness 
of both theater and national missile defense; <li>Congress should direct the Air Force 
to develop follow-on space-based defenses to begin deployment early in the next decade; 
<li>Congress should ensure that the Ballistic Missile Defense Office develops an integrated,
but open, architecture for battle management, command, control, and communications to 
support missile defense systems.</ol>14 pp. CONTACT: Chris OScannlain, The Heritage

Richard Fisher, Senior Policy Analyst at the Heritage Foundation, believes that deterring conflict in the 
Taiwan Strait is the most important challenge for American foreign policy in early 1996. China has 
militarily intimidated the emerging democratic system of Taiwan ever since the Republic of Chinas 
President, Lee Tenghui, visited the United States in June of 1995. According to Fisher, what is at stake in 
Taiwan is not only peace and stability in the region, but the viability of democracy in Taiwan. Since 1987 
the Republic of China has sought democratic political reforms that will soon make Taiwan a democracy.

This report by Richard Vedder, John M. Olin Visiting Professor of Labor Economics and Public Policy at 
the Center for the Study of American Business, argues that the U.S. GDP today might be 20 percent higher 
if the regulatory buildup that began in the Johnson Administration had not occured. According to his 
analysis, if regulatory activity remained at 1963 levels, the 1993 U.S. GDP would have been about $7.6 
trillion instead of $6.3 trillion. Vedder notes that regulation imposes direct costs, requiring businesses to 
commit resources to implement governmental mandates. He concludes by writing that while some 
regulations are necessary, such as those on food and drugs, other regualtions have expanded without fully 
considering the costs and consequences of such action. 13 pp. CONTACT: Center for the Study of

No.77, Center for the Study of American Business <BR></FONT>
<P>
Chairman of Center for the Study of American Business Murray Weidenbaum argues that nearly all of the 
attention in public policy discussions and legislation aimed at reducing the regulatory burden on business is 
focused on either very large enterprises or very small businesses. According to Weidenbaum, medium 
sized firms do not benefit from the protections provided to small businesses or the economies of scale 
generated by large businesses. Fortune 500 companies fill out basically the same forms and meet the same 
requirements as medium-sized firms. Therefore, the cost of complying with regulation is a higher percent 
of sales for the medium-sized firms than for larger ones. Weidenbaum shows that Congress has responded 
to the issue of uneven distribution of regulatory burdens in the predictable manner. Instead of reducing the 
burden of regulation, it has arbitrarily exempted companies of different sizes. He gives as an example, a 
series of federal regulations that take effect when a company hires its 50th employee. Because of this, some 
small firms are reluctant to expand. Weidenbaum concludes by recommending that Congress significantly 
reform and reduce regulation on business. CONTACT: Center for the Study of American Business,

<P>
The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and the five power marketing administrations (PMAs) are the 
entities that make the federal government the nations largest producer of electric power. According to 
Douglas Houston, Professor of Business Economics at the University of Kansas, these electricity 
businesses, along with other federally subsidized cooperatives and municipal utilities, are inefficient, 
poorly managed and at risk in the environment of electricity competition. Houston argues that privatizing 
federal electricity and ending current subsidies would have the following benefits:<br><ol><li>
the sale of federal power enterprises would raise $15-30 billion to reduce the national debt; <li>$7-10 billion in direct subsidies 
to government-owned utilities and cooperatives would end; <li> privatization would lead to improved 
performance and efficiency and eliminate the political interference in management and investment 
decisions that government owned utilities have to face; and <li> putting the transmission grids of the TVA 
and the PMAs into the emerging competitive market would promote efficiency and lower prices for 
consumers.</ol> Overall, Houston concludes that ending electricity subsidies and privatizing is a win-win 
situation. 36 pp. CONTACT: Reason Foundation, 3415 S. Sepulveda Blvd., Suite 400, Los Angeles, CA

Robert Poole, President of the Reason Foundation, writes that although Wisconsin has an excellent 
highway system, the majority of the states major highways will require reconstruction during the next 25 
years. Complicating matters, the Wisconsin Department of Transportation projects that current funding 
sources will fall $8.9 billion short of paying for the needed maintenance. As a solution to the shortfall, 
Poole proposes a public-private partnership to build toll roads in the state highway system. Poole believes 
that such a partnership has many benefits, including: highway innovations, new funding sources, risk 
transfer, new tax revenue, reduced operating costs, better-maintained roads, greater safety levels, 
congestion relief. Potential problems include: loss of public control, bankruptcy, labor issues and higher 
financing costs. Poole concludes with a description of what steps should be taken to bring about toll roads 
as a solution to Wisconsins highway maintenance problems including: a detailed feasability study and 
state and federal legislation to provide the adequate legal framework. 27 pp. CONTACT: Wisconsin Policy

According Transportation expert Peter Samuel, taxpayers are the biggest losers in American transportation 
policy. Samuel writes that although transportation policy is in need of reform in order to pay for its massive 
costs and to best serve the interests of commuters, entrenched interests stand in the way of meaningful 
reform. Those interests that directly influence transportation policy in Washington include: highway 
construction companies seeking more federally funded projects; social engineers seeking transit systems 
that conform to their ideals; and automobile organizations, such as AAA, who fight against such policy 
innovations as private toll roads that they feel threaten travel and commerce. Samuel illustrates the 
historical development of the transportation lobbies into what they are today and provides a history of 
government highway and transportation policy. Samuel concludes his report by saying that the first step of 
achieving reform is to realize that government monopoly in roads is not the solution. New technology and 
privatization are the answer, although it will entail taking on the entrench transportation lobbying forces 
inside the Beltway. 5 pp. CONTACT: Capital Research Center, 727 15th St., NW, 8th Floor, Washington,

<P>
Jerry Bowyer, President of the Allegheny Institute, criticizes a study prepared last year in the University of 
Pittsburghs &quot;Economic Benchmarks&quot; report, as well as other studies that suggest that racial prejudice is 
doing severe harm to the economic conditions of blacks, and that the city of Pittsburgh is worse in this 
regard than the rest of the nation. Bowyer provides evidence that economic disparity can almost entirely be 
attributed to a combination of distinct demographic patterns and behavioral factors within the black 
community and not racial prejudice. He notes that the University of Pittsburgh study does not take into 
account such factors as family structure and high school and college drop out rates. The researchers instead 
just measure disparity, and on this issue it is not even complete. Bowyer argues that it is irresponsible to 
report racial income disparity figures in a racially charged urban atmosphere, where the figures are likely to 
be misinterpreted, unless steps are taken to make sure that the results are properly understood. Bowyer 
concludes that these studies, because of their omissions, are more likely to further economic disparities 
than promote problemsolving. CONTACT: Allegheny Institute for Public Policy, Suite 612, 7 Parkway

Michael Cox and Beverly Fox, of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, explore why media reports paint a 
bleak picture of the average American workers prospects today, despite very positive economic indicators 
suggesting that the economy is thriving. After examining several different economic trends, the authors 
conclude that they are no cause for alarm. An examination of the dataan increase in employee benefits, a 
decline in median household or family size, and a shortening in the average workweekprovides a fairly 
bright picture of Americans improving living standards. According to Fox and Cox, from the perspective 
of the most long term and broadest economic aggregates, per capita real GDP and consumption, recent 
gains for Americans are on par with overall historical gains. 11 pp. CONTACT: National Center for Policy

during the past year the President has reneged on his pledge to include Chile in NAFTA by 1996, and the 
that Administration has violated key provisions of the treaty. Sweeney calls for several steps to be taken by 
the President to correct the current drift away from free trade:<br><ol><li>the U.S. should fulfill all of its NAFTA 
obligations on schedule; <li> NAFTA should be expanded; <li> Mexico should be encouraged to adopt a 
currency board; <li> the Administration should offer to negotiate forgiveness of Mexicos public sector 
foreign debt; and <li> the Administration should offer to negotiate a law enforcement agreement with 
Mexico to deal with the growing problem of international organized crime and drug trafficking.</ol> Sweeney 
also proposes a free-market solution for Mexican monetary troubles, writing that Clintons $50 billion 
bailout of Mexico has not only failed to stop the trend of devaluation, depression and eventual default, it 
also ignored principles of free-trade. 14 pp. CONTACT: Chris OScannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214

Ronald Utt, Visiting Fellow at The Heritage Foundation, suggests a strategy for Congress to get its budget 
and policy goals back on track. He argues that if Congress hopes to enact its legislative agenda this year, it 
should adopt a two-year budget and break down appropriations bills into more manageable pieces of 
legislation, noting that Clintons 1997 budget is already out, even though all the appropriations for 1996 
have yet to be passed. Utt also argues that Congress should not use last years strategy of waiting until the 
end of the year to present the president with an all-or-nothing appropriations bill. This strategy backfired 
and allowed President Clinton to avoid an open debate on the issue. If the appropriations process is broken 
down into smaller bills, contends Utt, Congress can directly debate policy on a program-by-program basis. 
This would expose the negative aspects of the Presidents defense of the status quo. Utt points out that the 
same strategy can be used on entitlement programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and welfare. Reforms in 
these programs were vetoed at once when combined in one huge reconciliation bill. If they were free 
standing measures, however, there would be a better chance of conducting a substantive policy debate. 7

Scott Hodge, Grover M. Herman Fellow in Federal Budgetary Affairs at The Heritage Foundation, 
illustrates that the Clinton Administration is still for big government, despite claims to the contrary. Hodge 
finds that the FY 1997 Clinton budget continues the era of big government in several ways: it increases 
federal spending by $361 billion over the next seven years and hikes tax revenue by $526 billion; it spends 
a total of $12.16 trillion over the next seven years, or $306 billion more than the vetoed Balance Budget 
Act of 1995$3,155 more for every household in America; it raises a total of $11.4 trillion in tax revenues 
over seven years, $187 billion more than the BBA, and $1,927 more in taxes for every household in 
America; it allows $119 billion more deficit spending through 2002 than the BBA, which is equivalent to 
passing along $1,227 per household in debt to the next generation of America workers; it fails to eliminate a 
single program of any significance; it fails to eliminate even one Cabinet-level agency; it increases 
entitlement spending by $365 billion over the next seven years while failing to save Medicare from 
bankruptcy, end welfare as we know it, or protect states from exploding costs of Medicaid; and it spends 
$111 billion more in spending on programs that have failed or become obsolete, that duplicate others, or 
that should be transferred to state and local government control. 13 pp. CONTACT: Chris OScannlain,

The 17 percent flat tax plan sponsored by House Majority Leader, Dick Armey, and Sen. Richard Shelby, 
shows no increase in the taxes paid by the vast majority of middle-class Americans when compared with 
their current tax burden, according to William Beach, Visiting Fellow in Tax Analysis, and Dan Mitchell, 
Heritage McKenna Senior Fellow in Political Economy. In fact, a 17percent  flat tax, on average, would 
lower taxes on all income groups. Based on IRS income-tax files for 1991, under a 17 percent flat tax, 
households with less than $15,000 per year in taxable income will experience a nearly 50 percent drop in 
their tax burden. Moreover, About 24 million families who pay federal income taxes now will pay no 
federal income taxes under the fully implemented Armey-Shelby flat tax, the analysts say, and nearly 
everyone else below $30,000 in taxable income will see their taxes fall. According to Beach and Mitchell, 
lower taxes will not mean higher deficits. The loss in individual income tax revenue under the Armey-
Shelby plan will be offset by increased revenue from middle-sized and big businesses. 7 pp. CONTACT:

Dan Mitchell, McKenna Senior Fellow in Political Economy at the Heritage Foundation, points out that 
polls show that workers, investors, savers, entrepreneurs, farmers, small business owners, and the elderly 
are among the groups of Americans drawn to the flat-tax because they feel that they will pay less. He then 
gives and elaborates on eight reasons why another group, liberals, should support the flat tax:<br><ol><li>the key 
philosophical principle of the flat tax is equality; <li> lower rates result in the rich shouldering more of the 
tax burden; <li>current deductions disproportionately benefit the wealthy and others able to exploit 
loopholes; <li>radically simplifying the code with a flat tax will help end the corrupting effect of tax 
lobbyists; <li>because of a generous family-based allowance, the poor are shielded from the income tax 
burden; <li>the flat tax will boost wages and income for lower-income and middle-income workers; <li>a 
pro-growth tax system will reduce the budget deficit; and <li>lower-income and middle-income taxpayers 
will enjoy a more financially secure retirement.</ol> Mitchell ends by including several quotes supporting a flat

Bruce Bartlett, Senior Fellow at the Alexis de Toqueville Institution, illustrates how the mortgage interest 
deduction has become the untouchable &quot;third rail&quot; in any discussion of a flat tax. This is despite the fact 
that homeowners would gain more from a flat-rate tax than they would lose if the mortgage deduction was 
taken away. Nonetheless, Bartlett points out, realtors have declared &quot;war&quot; against the flat tax. He 
dismantles the key study issued by the National Association of Realtors by DRI/McGraw-Hill, a private 
economic consulting firm, that concludes the Armey flat tax proposal would cause housing prices to 
collapse from the elimination of the mortgage interest deduction. According to Bartlett, not only would 
mortgage rates fall by about 18 percent as soon as the flat tax takes effect,  in the unlikely event that a flat 
tax caused housing prices to fall, the decline would only be temporary. Furthermore, the flat tax would benefit homeowners by eliminating the capital 
gains tax. 9 pp. CONTACT: National Center for Policy Analysis, 12655 N. Central Expy., Suite 720,

This issue features two articles examining grants made by the Center for Disease Control and the National 
Cancer Institute to nonprofit anti-smoking organizations. The articles discuss how tax dollars granted for 
disease research and public health education have been funneled into political advocacy. James Bennett, 
Professor of Economics at George Mason University, looks at the National Cancer Institutes illegal use of 
federal funds to promote a Colorado ballot initiative to raise the states tobacco tax. He unveils front 
groups created to provide a smokescreen for lobbying; state bureaucrats using state offices to facilitate 
lobbying; and the selling of positions of authority. In the other article Thomas DiLorenzo, Senior Fellow at 
the Capital Research Center, shows that the Center for Disease Control (CDC) is heavily involved in 
funding political advocacy. He centers on a $30,000 grant the CDC awarded to the American Lung 
Associations (ALA) May 1993 conference, Seize the Initiative: A National Training Conference for 
Increasing Tobacco Excise Taxes Through Initiated Acts. DiLorenzo states that CDC diverted from its

Richard Vedder, Professor of Economics at Ohio University, argues that capital cities in the United States 
are &quot;parasite economies&quot; which drain resources from surrounding areas. According to Vedder, lawyers, 
lobbyists, legislators, bureaucrats, and government contractors take productive resources from the average 
taxpayer to fill their own pockets. Vedder uses statistical comparisons of factors such as income, 
population change, unemployment, and working conditions to illustrate how capital cities &quot;siphon&quot;wealth 
from other areas. He shows that the average annual pay for workers in the Washington D.C. area exceeds 
the national average by 48 percent. Furthermore, the per capita income in the capital cities of the poorest 
states are about 17 percent above the state averages. Vedder concludes by saying that it is not a coincidence 
that a majority of the state capitals that have gained the most in relative affluence are in the poorest states. 
According to Vedder, this shows that the taxes that finance affluent capitals crowd out private-sector 
activity that is usually more efficient and productive than government activity. 23 pp. CONTACT: Cato

According to Heritage Health Care Policy Analyst John Lui, the National Governors Associations 
Medicaid reform plan ignores many of the biggest problems of the current system. He writes that the 
highly touted Medicaid reform plan drafted by the governors contains many needed reforms, but unless a 
final bill differs sharply in some critical details, the plan will be a disaster. The governors plan claims to 
scrap the Medicaid entitlement in favor of a system of block grants to the states, yet preserves a long list of 
benefits that must be provided to a large, entitled population. In addition, since the governors decision to 
guarentee Medicaid coverage to so many people will impose heavy burdens on state budgets, they also 
included an &quot;umbrella insurance&quot; provision that, in effect, &quot;entitles&quot; states to federal money. If states 
experience an unanticipated rise in the number of people eligible for Medicaid, the federal government 
would bear the cost, which almost certainly would increase the federal deficit. Liu recommends that 
Congress make the following changes to the governors plan:<br><ol><li>sharply limit the guaranteed populations 
and benefits of the entitlement; and <li>the umbrella should be a budgeted fund appropriated each year, not 
an entitlement to states.</ol> 3 pp. CONTACT: Chris OScannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214

Robert Rector, Senior Policy Analyst at the Heritage Foundation, criticizes the National Governors 
Associations welfare reform proposal for entirely ignoring the No. 1 problem that experts say perpetuates 
the welfare culture, illegitimacy. He also points out that the NGA plan repudiates most of the key elements 
of the Contract with America. The Contracts welfare reform was based on three themes: a national goal of 
reducing illegitimacy; national work requirements; and greater flexibility to state governments. The NGA 
plan, according to Rector, does not contain the first two principles of reform. Rector argues that the NGA 
plan is flawed in four aspects: <li>it abandons the welfare reform goal of reducing illegitimacy; <li>it 
eliminates all work requirements for AFDC recipients; <li>it has a pervasive anti-marriage bias; and <li>it 
embodies the Clinton Administrations &quot;reform&quot; structure, which penalizes states that pursue efficient plans.</ul> Rector concludes that bogus reforms, such as the NGA proposal, reduce public pressure for change 
and thereby helps encourage the existing system. 12 pp. CONTACT: Chris OScannlain, The Heritage

William Beach, Heritage Foundation Visiting Fellow in Tax Analysis, warns that the debate between 
Congress and the President on reforming Medicaid has not paid enough attention to the effect of the 
program on state finances. He writes that if significant reforms in Medicaid are not enacted, state 
governments will face a major increase in spending and a heavy increase in the proportion of their 
projected revenues that they must dedicate to the program. Beach shows that the cost of Medicaid to the 
federal government has grown at double-digit rates in recent years. Congressional Budget Office 
projections show annual federal Medicaid costs doubling by the year 2002. According to Beach there will 
be an estimated shift of $47.4 billion in mandated Medicaid spending from the federal government to state 
governments over the next seven years. He believes that states will respond in one of three ways:<br><ol><li>by 
enacting dramatic tax increases; <li>by reducing state spending on education, infrastructure, law 
enforcement, and other important state functions; or <li>by some combination of the first two.</ol> The National 
Association of State Budget Officers claims that Medicaid spending has already doubled from 
approximately 10 percent to 20 percent as a share of overall state spending since 1987. 5 pp. CONTACT:

David Tuerck, Executive Director of the Beacon Hill Institute, James Angelini, Professor of Accounting 
and Taxation at Suffolk University, and William OBrien, Resident Scholar at the Beacon Hill Institute, 
argue that the method by which the government funds welfare programs causes the taxpayer to have no 
incentive to take interest in how his money is spent. The taxpayer (who is a potential donor to charitable, 
nonprofit organizations) has no clear idea of how much of his tax money makes it to a welfare recipient, so 
he has no control over the tax dollar and therefore, argue Angelini, OBrien, and Tuerck, over the behavior 
of the welfare recipient. The authors propose that the same funds that now directly flow into government 
offices can instead flow into private charitable organizations. The tax credit they propose will allow 
taxpayers to deduct 100% of their contributions to eligible charities to up to 25% of their federal tax 
liability. This gives the taxpayer/donor control over where his dollar is spent. Angelini, OBrien, and 
Tuerck predict that such a tax credit will cause new organizations to respond to the increased opportunities 
presented to them. They conclude that competition will lead to efficiency and charitable organizations will 
be more innovative and successful than government in providing social services. 165 pp. CONTACT:

<P>
This study, by John Berthoud, Vice President of the Alexis de Toqueville Institution, reveals that if every 
item in the National Education Associations (NEA) Legislative Program for the 104th Congress were 
enacted, federal spending would increase by at least $702 billion annually. The study uses data on 
legislative proposals compiled by the National Taxpayers Union Foundation in their BillTally tracking 
system. The spending estimates for the different proposals come from non-partisan sources such as the 
Congressional Budget Office. One of the findings in this report is that the NEAs spending priorities are 
heavily skewed towards elderly Americans, despite NEAs claim that it is an educational organization with 
a primary focus on schools and children. The study finds that for each dollar in new spending on children 
and education that the NEA proposes (over $24 billion annually), it advocates $5.24 in new spending on 
Social Security. The report also claims that the taxes to fund the NEA agenda are probably politically 
impractical. According to the report, the NEA would need over thirteen times as much in taxes as was 
raised by the 1993 budget package. Berthoud points out, &quot;no organization that advocates this massive 
expansion of federal spending and probably massive increase in deficits can claim to be helping children. 
This agenda will break the financial back of Americas future generations.&quot; 31 pp.  CONTACT: The Alexis

Chester Finn, John M. Olin Fellow at the Hudson Institute, and Bruno Manno, Senior Fellow in the 
Education Policy Studies Program at the Hudson Institute, examine the state of American higher education. 
They point out that although American education has grown in the last fifty years in scale, wealth, allure, 
and stature, it is encountering public disapproval and consumer resistance. Productivity concerns, 
according to Finn and Manno, had been ignored because a college education use to pay off so well in the 
job market. Today, however, that payoff appears to be decreasing while the costs of higher education are 
increasing more quickly than inflation. Furthermore, funding is decreasing, consumers are becoming more 
conscious of costs, and the number of students available for enrollment is less. Finn and Manno claim that 
in order to solve these problems,  higher education must have a greater concern for productivity and a 
willingness to serve customers. They argue that administrators should cut costs, establish tougher entry 
requirements, and concentrate on serious academic subjects. However, they concede, the public will have 
to push them to do so. 16 pp. CONTACT: Hudson Institute, Herman Kahn Center, P.O. Box 26-919,

districts to pay for the pensions of union officials. They center on a case in the state of Rhode Island where 
officials of the National Education Association-Rhode Island, and the Rhode Island Federation of Teachers 
benefited from legislation enacted in 1987 which extended the benefits of the states retirement system to 
full-time employees of organizations representing employees of the state and/or any political subdivision 
thereof for the purpose of collective bargaining. Lieberman and Haar also cover the ensuing legal battle 
since the details of the legislation were exposed in the press and subsequently repealed in the Rhode Island 
legislature. They conclude by calling for the prohibition of this practice in other states and encourage

Raymond Keating, Chief Economist at SBSC, criticizes the federal government Superfund program by 
documenting the massive costs and inefficiencies of the Superfund program, which was designed to help 
clean up hazardous waste sites across the country. Keating illustrates how only 18 percent of the worst 
waste sites have been cleaned up at a combined government/private sector cost of roughly $90 million. 
According to Keating, Superfund turned essentially local or state problems into national problems and 
granted the inefficient federal bureaucracy jurisdiction over them. Keating offers a three-step reform 
process for Superfund:<br><ol><li> repeal the retroactive liability for all actions taken before 1987, use science-
based risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis to determine required clean up remedies, and cap the 
number of Superfund sites to gain some control over costs; <li> to bring fairness and common sense, repeal 
the strict, retroactive, and joint and several liability schemes altogether, and only assign liability to 
individuals and businesses who broke the law, and <li> eventually abolish Superfund entirelywaste sites 
are a local problem, not federal.</ol>  28 pp. CONTACT: Small Business Survival Foundation, 1320 18th

<P>
This issue of EPA Watch features an article on the conflict between EPA and industry over EPAs efforts to 
expand the breadth and depth of the toxic release inventory (TRI) and the controversial issue of material 
accounting. The TRI is the list of chemicals whose emissions certain industries must report annually to 
EPA. EPA is proposing to nearly double the size of this list. Material accounting would require industries 
to report not only emissions, but also the amounts of a certain chemical used at key intervals in the 
manufacturing process. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce led a group of forty companies and trade 
associations in blasting the proposal in a letter to EPA Administrator Carol Browner. They claimed the goal 
of TRI is to provide information to the public so that they can make informed decisions about risk. 
Chemical use is not relative information because it is not a good indicator of risk. On top of that, EPA does 
not have the legislative authority to collect and make public chemical use information. This issue is even 
controversial in the agency itself, as many EPA scientists argue that better use can be made of resources by 
concentrating on more serious risks. 8 pp.  CONTACT: EPA Watch, 14140-L Parke Long Court, Chantilly,

<P>
Increasing incarceration rates since 1980 have led to a projected 294 percent increase in the prison 
population of the state of Pennsylvania. The funding for the states corrections department has grown at a 
similar rate. In order to afford new prison construction costs, The Commonwealth Foundation calls for 
privatizing the states prisons. According to this report, privatization saves money because government is 
simply not capable of delivering, running, and regulating services either as efficiently or as effectively as 
private firms. Various studies show that prison privatization would likely save at least 10 percent per year 
in operations costs. This report illustrates how private prisons save operational funds and construction 
costs. It is also shown that private prisons are constitutionally sound. The report concludes that 
privatization of the construction and operation of the new prisons needed in Pennsylvania as of the year 
2000, as well at the operations of existing prisons, is exceptionally attractive financially, and maybe even a 
necessity in times of financial belt-tightening. 20 pp. CONTACT: The Commonwealth Foundation, 600 N.

<I><font size=3>Briefing, Pacific Research Institute</FONT></I><font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">
</FONT>
<P> 
Vice-President of Research at the Pacific Research Institute Steven Hayward looks at the effects of punitive 
damages  in civil litigation, which are demanded in 27 percent of all cases where they are conceivably 
recoverable. Hayward uses lawsuit filing data to show that business and government defendants are four 
times as likely as an individual defendant to face a lawsuit that demands punitive damages. Lawsuits with 
punitive damage demands take one-third longer to resolve than suits without them. Punitive damages tilt 
the playing field towards the demanding parties, according to Hayward, and increase out-of-court 
settlement amounts. Hayward provides evidence against studies that claim the risk of receiving an adverse 
punitive damage judgment is remote. Closer scrutiny of data shows that the probability of punitive damage 
awards is vastly understated by such studies, partly because the data has been improperly qualified and 
mostly because the vast majority of lawsuites are settled out of court where punitive damage demands play 
a significant role. 14 pp. CONTACT: Pacific Research Institute, 755 Sansome St., San Francisco, CA

<P>
Ronald Utt, Visiting Fellow at the Heritage Foundation, examines what has been accomplished by 
Congress this session in closing unneeded and obsolete government agencies. He finds that Congress has 
done a respectable jobespecially in relation to past Congressesbut that there is much more to be done. 
They did better than most observers expected, closing over 270 agencies, divisions, offices, and programs 
of various areas of the federal government. Utt also looks at what actions Congress took in 41 specific 
agencies recommended for termination by the Heritage Foundation. Excluding the five independent 
agencies that are not subject to the annual appropriations process, Utt found that Congresss record of the 
remaining 36 was: 13 agencies terminated and $3.6 billion saved over the next five years; funding for 12 
agencies substantially reduced by 10 percent or more) and $2.2 billion saved over five years; and no 
change or only limited change (funding cut by 10 percent or less) at 11 agencies and up to $40 million 
saved over the next five years. Utt also shows that of the 11 agencies not significantly reduced in funding 
terminated, all but onethe Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial Commission, whose funding was 
tripledsaw their funding either modestly reduced or frozen at 1995 levels. Despite Congresss proven 
effort to reduce government waste, Utt points out, President Clinton opposed many of these efforts by 
vetoing five of the appropriations bills put forth by Congress. He concludes by outlining termination and 
consolidation objectives for the FY 1997 budget. 20 pp. CONTACT: Chris OScannlain, The Heritage

Paul Grant, an attorney in Parker, Colorado, examines the importance of citizen initiatives in that state. He 
reports recent instances of Colorados elected and appointed government officials retaliating against 
initiatives that they are not happy with, and argues that Colorados Secretary of State, General Assembly 
and Supreme Court have combined to weaken the power of initiative. According to Grant, this has been 
done through burdensome new regulations, petty and substantial interference from the Secretary of State, 
legislative attacks on the initiative process, and Colorado Supreme Court interferences. Overall the 
initiative process has been made more difficult, expensive and less effective. Grant looks at the methods 
and motives of attackers of the initiative process, and he considers legal analysis which might be useful in 
resisting and reversing damage caused to this &quot;vital check on runaway government power.&quot; 10 pp.

In this comprehensive study, Austin Fulk, Research Associate, and Stuart Nolan, Visiting Fellow at Capital 
Research Center, surveyed 1993 corporate contributions from the 250 largest American corporations to 
cover 300 nonprofit public interest and special interest advocacy groups. Using available corporate and IRS 
data, Fulk and Nolan were able to identify over $36 million in contributions by 166 corporations to groups 
across the political spectrum. They found that for every $1.00 that corporations gave to conservative and 
free market policy groups, $4.07 was given to liberal groups favoring increased government spending and 
regulation. The book also uncovers a development in public affairs during the Clinton Administration: 
Although many corporations are downsizing their operations, some of them are supporting nonprofit 
advocacy groups whose lobbying activities promote big government and undermine the free enterprise 
system. The guide also lists specific grants made by Forbes 250 companies, and includes a cross-reference 
to easily check which companies fund which advocacy groups. 193 pp. CONTACT: Capital Research

<b>CIR Wins Appeal Challenging Racial Preferences</b><p> CIR won a major victory in March when an unanimous panel of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals held 
that the university of Texas Law Schools use of racial preferences in student admissions is unconstitutional. CIR represents Cheryl Hopwood and Douglas Carvell, white applicants to the 1992 incoming class of the University of Texas Law School who were denied admission on the basis of their race despite their superior qualifications. In its ruling, the Fifth Circuit declared that diversity is not a 
compelling state interest that would justify the use of racial preferences. The Court stated that [w]ithin the general principles of the fourteenth Amendment, the use of race in admissions for diversity in higher education contradicts, rather than furthers, the aims of equal protection. Diversity fosters, rather than 
minimizes, the use of race. It treats minorities as a group, rather than as individuals. The Fifth Circuit held that Justice Powells opinion in Board of Regents v. Bakke, in which he advocated the consideration of race 
to achieve diversity, never represented the view of a majority of the Supreme Court and, in light of more recent Supreme Court rulings, did not justify the law school race-based admissions program. The Fifth Circuit held further that the government may employ racial preferences only as a means of redressing past 
discrimination by a particular government unitin this case, UT Law School. Racial preferences may not be used to redress alleged discrimination by entire educational systems.  <p>
 
<b>Update on CIR's Case Against HUD Officials</b><p>CIR is representing the Berkeley 3, residents of Berkeley, CA who were targets of a prolonged 
investigation by the Department of Housing and Urban Development.  In response to an administrative complaint filed by a so-called fair housing organization that the residents exercise of their First Amendment rights to protest the governments proposed conversion of a nearby hotel to a homeless shelter constituted discrimination, HUD conducted a lengthy investigation of the residents activities.  CIR filed suit on behalf of the Berkeley 3 against various HUD officers, in both their official and individual capacities, last May.  <p>
 
The Court denied the defendants motion to dismiss on the ground that the complaint failed to state a violation of the First Amendment and that the individual defendants are protected by qualified immunity.  The Court found the defendants arguments that no investigation can violate the First Amendment striking 
in its audacity, and concluded that it would be premature to resolve the issue of qualified immunity solely on the allegations of the complaint.  The Court did grant defendants motion to dismiss plaintiffs injunctive relief claims, but granted plaintiffs leave to replead (which they have done). <p>

<b>Defenders Tells State It Cannot "Have Its Cake and Eat It Too."</b><p>
Defenders has argued its Motion for Summary Judgment and Opposition to the States Motion to Dismiss 
before Judge Preece of the Ninth Judicial District in Clearwater County, Minnesota.  James Peternell owns 
2/3rd interest in an 112-acre Rice Slough, which the state, pursuant to legislation passed in 1979, classified 
as a public water.  That classification did not, in an of itself, however, change the rights of the property 
owner.  In 1994, the state had criminally prosecuted James Peternell for attempting to exclude from his 
portion of the Rice Slough an uninvited member of the public (who later turned out to be an undercover 
DNR agent) and for leaving duck decoys out overnight on public water.  Although the jury acquitted Mr. 
Peternell of both criminal counts in 1995, Defenders brought its lawsuit alleging that as a result of the 
prosecution, Peternell has lost his right to exclude others from his property in violation of the Fifth 
Amendment.  In response to this lawsuit for compensation, the state has now changed its position.  During 
oral arguments, the state agreed with Defenders that Peternell can exclude members of the public from his 
property.  Defenders is seeking a court order so holding which will force the state to obey the Constitution 
and prevent any further unwarranted criminal prosecutions of Mr. Peternell.   <p>

<b>Sixth Circuit Asks Feds to Respond to MSLF Rehearing Petition</b><p> 
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit has ordered the U.S. Forest Service to respond to a petition 
by MSLF fro a rehearing en banc.  MSLFs petition follows the decision by a three judge panel that private 
property in Michigan may be regulated by the Forest Service as a wilderness despite the provision of the 
Wilderness Act of 1964 that only federal land may be classified as wilderness. 
<p> 
Lake front property owners in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan have been told by the U.S. Forest Service 
that their rights to use the entire surface of Crooked Lakea right recognized by Michigan Lawcan be 
denied by the Forest Service since it owns property abutting the southern portion of the Lake. The Forest 
Service claims the Property Clause of the Constitution gives it such authority over private property. 
<p> 
<b>Appeals Court Hears MSLF Challenge to Clinton Tax</b><p> 
A potentially precedent-setting challenge to President Clintons 1993 tax legislation, contending that the 
tax on transportation fuels violates the U.S. Constitution, was heard recently by the U.S. Court of Appeals 
for the Tenth Circuit.  In oral arguments before the three-judge panel, the Wyoming Trucking Association 
asserted that because the transportation fuel tax increase failed to originate in the House of Representatives 
(the House has passed a BTU tax), it violates the Constitutions Origination Clause. 
<p> 
The case is on appeal from federal district court in Wyoming where the Wyoming Trucking Associations 
lawsuit was dismissed when the court held that it had no jurisdiction to hear the case.  The district court 
ruled that any challenge to federal tax liability must first be heard by the Commissioner of the Internal 
Revenue Service.  The Association claims a hearing before the IRS would be futile since it cannot rule

<b>NELF Brief Aids in Major Win For Massachusetts CPAs.</b><p> 
In a case with national implications, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has ruled that the state can 
constitutionally prohibit unlicensed accountants (non-CPAs) from using any language that might mislead 
the public as to their qualifications. The court also held that the state can bar such unlicensed accountants 
from preparing and distributing audits and financial reports to clients or third parties. 
<p> 
The decision involved Mr. Volin, an unlicensed accountant supported by a national association of such 
people.  Volin argued that the First Amendment prohibited the state from preventing non-CPAs from 
claiming the title accountant.  He also claimed the right to use adjectives such as qualified, 
experienced and independent, although he was not licensed by any state or recognized national 
accrediting organization. 
<p> 
But the court agreed with an amicus brief filed by NELF which argued that the states rules promote the 
public interest by protecting clients, financial institutions, suppliers and others from the consequences of 
inaccurate or misleading financial data.  NELFs brief pointed out that every state in the nation has had 
such regulations on the books for decades and that a decision in Volins favor would cause financial 
institutions and suppliers to raise questions about the reliability of financial data regarding the states 
businesses which would harm their ability to engage in interstate and international trade. 
<p> 
The court held that Volin could use the bare word accountant to describe himself, but it barred use of 
modifiers which might imply licensure or special qualifica-tions, and it barred him from distributing 
financial reports.  By upholding the states rules, the court set back national efforts to weaken regulation of 
the accounting profession.

<b>NELF Supreme Court Brief Challenges Expansion of Corporate Liability Under 
Federal Pension Law.</b><p> 
Spink v. Lockheed Corporation involves Lockheeds effort to reduce its defense workforce as a result of 
post-Cold War cutbacks in the defense budget.  One element of Lockheeds effort was to offer workers a 
generous package of additional pension benefits if they agreed to take voluntary early retirement.  Sensibly 
enough, Lockheed coupled that offer with a requirement that workers who accepted enhanced retirement 
benefits must wave possible claims against Lockheed arising from termination of employment.  Lockheed 
added this proviso to protect itself against the increasingly common practice of workers accepting 
enhanced retirement benefits and then suing their former employer claiming violations of the age 
discrimination or other employment-related laws. 
<p> 
Spink refused to sign the waiver and so did not take early retirement. Instead he sued Lockheed, claiming 
that coupling enhanced benefits with a required waiver violated ERISA, the federal pension protection law. 
Spink argued that Lockheed was a fiduciary with respect to assets held under its retirement plan and could 
not use the promise of increased benefits to induce recipients to grant waivers that would protect it. While a 
District Court dismissed Spinks claim, the Court of Appeals in San Francisco reversed. 
<p> 
The case raises two key issues: 1) was the decision to award increased benefits in return for a waiver a 
prohibited transaction in violation of ERISA; and 2) is a corporate plan sponsor an ERISA fiduciary. 
Since Lockheed fully addressed the first issue, NELF only discussed the fiduciary issue. That issue matters, 
because, under ERISA, fiduciaries are subject to civil suits for compensatory damages and attorneys fees, 
while non-fiduciaries are generally subject only to regulatory orders to undo improper actions. 
<p> 
NELFs brief argued that it is irrational to treat plan sponsors as fiduciaries. Corporations are responsible to 
shareholders, not to retirees. While they must obey ERISA and other laws, they cannot put retirees 
interests above their own, as fiduciaries must. The history of ERISA recognizes that plan sponsors and 
fiduciaries, i.e. fund trustees, have different responsibilities. Consistent with pre-existing trust law, under 
ERISA fiduciaries are fully subject to civil suit, while corporations and those that aid them, such as 
accountants and third party benefit administrators, are subject only to regulatory constraints. 
<p> 
<b>NELF Files Amicus Brief in First Circuit Superfund Case.</b><p> 
NELF has filed an amicus brief with the Court of Appeals in a case in which the government seeks to make 
a company pay millions of dollars in Superfund cleanup costs without a chance to defend itself. United 
States v. Cooper Industries involves a Massachusetts site polluted 50 years ago. The Friedlands later 
bought the land and leased it to Cooper Industries. As part of a standard lease, Cooper promised to 
indemnify the Friedlands for costs which they might incur from its activities. Later, after passage of 
CERCLA, the Superfund law, the government sued the Fried lands and Cooper because they owned or 
worked on polluted land. The cleanup estimate was $42 million, with Cooper 22% responsible and the 
Friedlands 29% responsible. 
Then the government hit upon the idea of having the Friedlands use the indemnity provision to pass 
through cleanup costs. Although the clause predated passage of CERCLA, a judge held that it applied to 
CERCLA-related costs. The government then made the Friedlands the proverbial offer they could not 
refuse. If the Friedlands stipulated they were liable for the full $42 million in damages, the government 
would collect the money from indemnity proceeds, i.e., from Cooper. Thus the Friedlands agreed to an 
enormous fine so long as someone else would pay it.  Furthermore, since Cooper had to pay the money 
under the indemnity, not under CERCLA, it could not use any CERCLA defenses or argue that the costs 
were unreasonable or unnecessary. 
<p> 
Obviously, this is grossly unfair to Cooper which must pay millions of dollars in cleanup costs without a 
chance to protect itself. It will also lead to waste in administering CERCLA cleanups. By using the back 
door of indemnity, government can avoid having to prove its costs are reasonable.  Without that check, 
costs will continue to spiral.  A decision on Coopers appeal is likely by summer.

<b>PACIFIC LEGAL FOUNDATION </b>
<p> 
<b>First Amendment Right to Language Diversity?</b><p> 
As a taxpayer, and ultimately the employer of government workers, do you have the right to set 
reasonable rules concerning the operation of the agencies you underwrite with tax dollars?  Conversely, do 
government workers have a constitutional right to promote their individual agenda by disregarding 
reasonable workplace policies?  More specifically, should state employees be allowed to drag their bosses 
into federal court because they are required to carry out their responsibilities in English?  These 
fundamental questions are at issue in a case in which Pacific Legal Foundation recently asked the U.S. 
Supreme Court to strike down a U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling Yniguez v. Arizonans for 
Official Language that the free speech right of the public employees are offended by requiring them to 
conduct their jobs in the nations predominant languageEnglish. Should the U.S. Supreme Court accept 
this case, PLF will argue, among other things, that government bureaucrats have no right to turn every 
workplace disagreement into a federal case.  
 <p>
Last October the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals declared unconstitutional Arizonas Official Language 
amendment to the state constitution.  Enacted by Arizona voters in 1988, it declared English the states 
official language and requires the state and all political subdivisions to act in English and in no other 
language.  The amendment applies to all state government employees during the performance of their 
government business.  It is not and outright ban against conversing in a language other than English.

<b>Malibu Declares Moratorium on Constitution</b><p> 
In 1988, Diana Merritt-Shriner and her husband bought 16 acres in Malibu, California, with the intent of 
dividing the lot into three parcels.  They spent three years paying off the loans and formulating their plans 
to build one house on each of the lots.  The county granted tentative parcel approval of the plan in June 
1990, and they subsequently were granted permits buy the Coastal Commission. 
<p> 
All was going well until the creation off the City of Malibu in 1991, when the new city leaders passed a 
law imposing a moratorium on all new development so that it could create and adopt a general plan and 
zoning ordinances.  This turn of events left the Shriners with about $75,000 of incurred expenses and a 16-
acre plot on which no development would be allowed under the terms of the moratorium. 
<p> 
Hard-nosed city bureaucrats denied the Shriners permit request despite state and county rules that would 
have allowed for an exception under unfortunate circumstances.  Although the Shriners land was located 
in a residential neighborhood, the city designated the area as potential open space or parkland even though 
it had no funds with which to purchase the property for those uses!  Furthermore, the county placed a 
Road and Water Assessment Bond against the property in the amount of $279,000 for which the 
Shriners are liable, even though there have not been any water or road impacts since no homes exist on the 
property. 
<p> 
PLF argued to the California Court of Appeal that under circumstances like these, city bureaucrats must not 
abuse their powers in a way that imposes economic hardship on property owners when it is clear that no 
public health, safety, and welfare concerns are being advanced.

<b>36 Members of Congress Support Florida Suit on Immigration Costs</b><p> 
On behalf of itself and a bipartisan group of five United States Senators (Mack, Graham, DAmato, 
Hutchison, and Feinstein) and 34 Representatives, WLF filed a brief urging the U.S. Supreme Court to hear 
the State of Floridas lawsuit against the federal government in Chiles v. United States.  Florida brought the 
suit to compel the federal government to compensate Florida for the fiscal burdens resulting from the 
federal governments failure to enforce its own immigration laws adequately. 
<p> 
WLFs brief focuses on the fiscal effects of federal mandates upon states to provide education of illegal 
aliens without federal assistance to offset those expenses.  According to WLFs brief, if the federal 
government fails to control illegal immigration adequately, the result is a massive unfunded mandate 
imposed upon the states to provide for the immigrants education and medical care.  Based on the Supreme 
Courts 1992 decision in New York v. United States, WLF argues that although the federal government can 
create incentives for a state to provide such services, it lacks the power to hijack state resources unilaterally 
in this manner. The constitutionality of the federal governments failure to provide reimbursement is not 
just the subject of Floridas suit but of pending litigation brought by other states across the country:  
<p> 
<b>Miranda Decision Superseded by Statute, 
WLF Contends</b><p> 
WLF filed a brief in a Utah bank robbery case, United States v. Nafka, arguing that incriminating 
statements by defendants must be admitted into evidence even if their Miranda right were technically 
violated. WLF pointed out the Miranda has been superseded in federal prosecutions by 18 U.S.C. 3501, 
which provides that statements shall be admissible as evidence if the confession was otherwise voluntary.  
In such cases, according to 3501, the totality of the circumstances should be examined by the trial court.  
Although the U.S. Justice Department has generally failed to invoke 3501 since its enactment in 1968, the 
United States Attorney prosecuting the Utah case has asked the court to consider WLFs arguments.

<b>Apple Growers Ask Supreme Court to 
Hear Appeal</b><p> 
On seventh anniversary of a controversial 60 Minutes broadcast that portrayed apples treated with Alar 
as carcinogenic, a group of Washington State apple growers asked the U.S. Supreme Court to hear their 
suit against CBS for falsity of the broadcast.  The growers, represented by WLF, suffered losses of over 
$75 million from the broadcast, which called Alar  the most potent cancer-causing agent in the food 
supply.  Alar is an EPA-approved growth regulator for apples; according to eminent scientists, there is no 
reliable evidence that Alar causes cancer in humans. In fact, because fruits and vegetables contain 
anticarcinogens, eating them - including those treated with pesticides - is a good way to reduce cancer risk.

<h3>March, 1996 <i>Insider</i></h3>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>Understanding Corporate Government Relations
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<hr><P>
<font size=3>


	After nearly 34 years in the corporate world, I welcomed the opportunity to join <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a> after the 1994 elections, when the prospect of a conservative revolution presented an 
irresistible second career challenge. I had always respected the conservative movement and 
supported its mission, even when I found my business colleagues on the other side of an issue.
	In my old job in the corporate community, I found that conservative analysts and activists are 
often suspicious of business. Indeed, in the interest of earning &quot;business value&quot; for 
their companies and shareholders, corporate government affairs offices often put narrow 
economic interests over the broader philosophical or political objectives that motivate 
conservatives. The business community cares less about ideology than about finding the power 
center and lining up advocates on its key issues. This may translate into support for a piece of 
compromise legislation that lifts a burden, lessens a cost, or lowers a barrier, even if it isnt the 
proposal conservatives took to the table.<p>
	The business communitys pragmatic approach to policy making is not very inspiring, but it can 
bring closure and progress on its objectives. My corporate experiences suggest that sometimes 
the beauty of an idea crowds out the importance of strategically implementing a focused plan to 
achieve your objectives. This most certainly is not to suggest compromise on principle, but 
rather the need for a system that is acutely aware of its environment, regularly takes stock of how 
its agenda items are proceeding, and makes necessary adjustments to its priorities, goals, and 
strategies. <p>
Although the commercial instinct for closure and moving on to the next priority often 
serves business interests business interests well enough, it does not always serve them best. 
When it began to appear in the fall of 1994 that conservatives could seriously increase their 
presence in the House and Senate, those positioned to take over the new leadership positions 
were proclaiming a sea change rollback of government.<p>
	The reality of governing, however, dictates that conservatives cannot expect to reform 40 years 
of liberal policies overnight: reinventing government is a slow, deliberate process. Take 
Superfund, for example. Business had pushed hard for meaningful reform of the burdensome 
program and at long last, in 1994, had a bill in committee that was acceptable, though not ideal. 
But conservative senators, sensing the probability of having a majority in Congress after the 
elections, defeated the compromise legislation, promising a &quot;better&quot; bill after the 
election. Business listened to its ideological friends and acted against its instinct for closure, 
deciding to wait for the &quot;better&quot; bill. Because business quickly adjusted to the 
changing political environment and acted against its natural instincts, it will likely see that 
&quot;better&quot; bill enacted some time this year.<p>
	Despite rhetorical victories and the perception that our ideological friends have taken over, many 
point out that the rollback theme has not substantively advanced either the conservative or 
business reform agendas. But should we realistically have expected to overhaul decades worth of 
bureaucratic growth overnight?. Insufficient strength in Congress, special interest tactics, and a 
demagogic White House have thwarted usso far.<p>
	The business and policy communities will  eventually see key components of their agendas 
enacted, however, if they make timely adjustments to strategy, focus on the most important 
goals, and a develop a keen awareness of changing legislative and poltical environments. From 
my perspective, we can have more success advancing the conservative agenda in 1996 if we 
learn to focus our energies on the most important goals by adapting more quickly and shrewdly 
to this volatile political environment, as business did with Superfund reform.<p>
	Management guru and author Tom Peters has said that even the best-run companies are only 18 
months from failure. In order to stay competitive, well-run companies gear their systems to 
anticipate changes in their environments and adjust plans accordingly. Policy making (or 
unmaking) is a complicated task worthy of the best thought and strategic planning. 
Conservatives need to sharpen their skills at anticipating changes in the debate, adjusting our 
marketing and message delivery, and building strategic coalitions. The movement may not have 
the luxury of 18 months to consolidate the revolutionfocus and closure are critical.<p>

Beware of Deploying U.S. Peacekeepers on the Golan Heights,
</a></FONT></B><font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">
by Thomas Moore and James Phillips</FONT>

<I><font size=3>Backgrounder</FONT></I><font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">
No. 1066, The Heritage Foundation</FONT>
<P>
Thomas Moore, Deputy Director of Foreign Policy and
Defense Studies at The Heritage Foundation, and James Phillips,
Heritage Senior Policy Analyst, warn against the possibility that
the Clinton Administration might bridge the peace negotiation
gap between Israel and Syria by offering U.S. peacekeeping forces
to monitor compliance with any agreement that might come about.
Moore and Phillips offer several reasons why such a deployment
of U.S. forces should not occur, among them:
<ol><li> the Golan Heights present a more formidable peacekeeping
challenge than the existingU.S. peacekeeping mission on the Sinai Peninsula;
<li> terrorism would pose a threat to U.S. troops; 
<li> U.S.-Israel relations may be adversely affected;
<li> the cost to, and  drain on, U.S. forces.
</ol>
They call for Congress to press the Clinton Administration to rule out foreign aid
to Syria as a sweetener for a peace agreement and to maintain pressure on Syria
to halt its support of terrorism. Moore and Phillips conclude that Congress should
open debate on the Golan peacekeeping issue before it is presented with another
<I>fait accompli</I> like Haiti or Bosnia. 9 pp. CONTACT: Chris

The Cuba Transition Commitee, chaired by Jeb Bush
and composed of 44 Cuban American and U.S.-Cuba policy experts,
has produced a resource guide that provides recommended initiatives
for a three phase process for a Cuban transition to democracy
and suggests what the U.S. might do to encourage such a transition.
The guide, which also lists 66 non-governmental organizations
and 37 foundations that could play a role in the process, will
be distributed to Cuban dissidents on the island, exiles in the
U.S. and abroad, U.S. government officials, and others. 90 pp.

<B>Unfunded Federal Mandates in Transportation: The
Case for Unilateral Devolution, <BR>
</B>by Tom McClintock
<P>
The Claremont Institute
<P>
Tom McClintock, Director, Economic and Regulatory
Affairs, at the Golden State Center for Policy Studies of the
Claremont Institute, illustrates the burden that unfunded federal
mandates have on the State of California.  McClintock suggests
that California might consider forgoing federal funds and not
be obligated to the mandates attached to them, pointing out that
while the federal assistance for programs is massive-so are the
costs of the mandates. McClintock argues that although the state
would forfeit revenues far beyond the unfunded cost of federal
mandates, there would be enormous savings from the more efficient
application of remaining revenues toward truly high-priority public
objectives. For example, McClintock concludes that if California
kicked the federal government out of state transportation policy,
it would lose $2.3 billion in federal funds. However, California
would save $1.9 billion in unnecessary mandated expenditures.
By recouping a portion of federal highway taxes, the missing $400,000
could be transferred from the federal government to the state
without an increase in the total tax burden. 12 pp. CONTACT: The

<B>Restructuring America's Water Industry: Comparing
Investor-Owned and Government-Owned Water Systems, </B>
by Kathy Neal, <BR>
Patrick Maloney, Jonas Marson &amp; Tamer Francis
</font><P>
Reason Foundation
<P>
The performance of investor-owned water companies
is compared with government-owned water companies in California
in order to gauge the potential benefits of restructuring the
industry. The study focuses on tax subsidization, the cost of
capital, water charges, operating costs, investment income, and
capital expenditures. Among the results of an analysis of the
data are: investor-owned water companies provide comparable water
services to consumers at the same price as government-owned water
companies even though they pay taxes and do not receive extra
income; government-owned water companies receive generous tax
subsidies that otherwise could be used to lower taxes or fund
other government projects with higher priorities; the net cost
of capital is higher for government-owned water companies than
for investor-owned water companies; investor-owned companies are
substantially more efficient in their operation than government-owned
water companies; and government-owned water companies receive
a substantial amount of non-operating income from excess cash
balances and investments. The authors conclude that the decision
to have government entities provide water to consumers should
be reconsidered, since investor-owned companies can provide this
same function at the same cost without subsidies or tax-exemptions.

<P>
Washington Institute
<P>
Washington Institute Senior Research Fellow Elaine
Ramel Davis updates the status of regulatory reform in Washington
State. Davis summarizes the accomplishments of the Regulatory
Reform Act and compares them with the Institute's earlier recommendations.
Davis believes that the RRA was a good start to the process of
reducing the amount of government regulation in Washington state.
However she also illustrates that while the RRA &quot;slows the
flow&quot; of new and increasingly onerous state regulations,
more needs to be done to end overburdensome regulations. 5 pp.

Raymond Keating, Chief Economist with the Small Business
Survival Foundation, reviews the responsibilities, tactics and
strategies, and budget of the FDA, as well as the administration's
impact on entrepreneurs. Keating recommends the following reforms:
<ol><li>scrapping the FDA in favor of a smaller agency geared toward
safety and education;<br><li>subjecting manufacturers and approval
enterprises  to the incentives of a sound legal system;<br><li>allowing
manufacturers to distribute information regarding off-label uses
of drugs, such as independent studies and journal articles;<br><li>
annual congressional scrutiny of the federal agency's enforcement
powers, as well as its processes and standards for determining
what products fall under its jurisdiction;<br><li>negotiating and
entering into agreements with other nations to recognize each
other's drug and medical device approvals;<br><li>enhancing incentives
for investment in dynamic industries, like pharmaceuticals and
medical devices. 25 pp.</ol><br>

<B>Hazardous to our Health? FDA Regulation of Health
Care Products, </B>edited
by Robert Higgs
<P>
The Independent Institute


<P>
Robert Higgs, Research Director, The Independent
Institute, Ronald Hansen, Associate Dean for Academic Affairs
at the William E. Simon Graduate School of Business Administration,
and  Paul Rubin, Professor of Economics at Emory University, examine
FDA's regulation of health care products. The book's introduction
and afterword place the activities of FDA into a larger perspective
by illustrating how the agency acquired its vast powers, how it
uses those powers, and what harm caused by FDA could be diminished
by abolishing the agency. Other chapters argue that FDA, largely
regarded as a scientific body devoted to protecting public health,
is in fact a highly politicized body, often harming the public
health. Another chapter focuses on the restrictions that FDA places
on the marketing of drugs. According to the authors, these advertising
restrictions assume that consumers should be treated as if they
are unsophisticated and easily misled, and that doctors are not
reliable judges of medicines. The authors conclude that the root
cause of the harm caused by FDA regulations arise from the enormous
discretion Congress has given the agency. 113 pp.  CONTACT: The

<B>The Truth About Income Inequality,</B>
<BR>
by John Hinderaker and Scott Johnson
<P>
Center for the American Experiment
<P>
John Hinderaker and Scott Johnson, attorneys in Minneapolis,
examine liberal claims that there is a widening income inequality
and a disappearing middle class in America. They illustrate that
these claims have been based, almost universally, on biased analyses
which manipulate and distort the underlying economic facts. Overall,
they conclude that basic economic data does not support the gloomy
picture promoted by liberals. Furthermore, Hinderaker and Johnson
write that the data shows that the last 25 years does not represent
an upward or downward trend for middle-and lower-income Americans.
The data also does not suggest that higher taxes, increased government
spending, or hyper-regulation of the economy will benefit middle-income
or lower-income citizens. 18 pp. CONTACT: Center for the American

<B>The Value of Fringe Benefits and Tenure in Wisconsin:
Public Versus Private, <BR>
</B>by Richard Cebula
<P>
Wisconsin Policy Research Institute
<P>
In this study, Richard Cebula, an economist at Georgia
Tech, examines the differentials in the levels of fringe benefits
provided to full-time workers between the public and private sectors
in Wisconsin. He also examines the value of tenure or its equivalent
in the Wisconsin public school system at the primary and secondary
levels. Cebula examines each major category of fringe benefits
and then all benefits combined, concluding that the overall fringe-benefit
value appears to be 36% higher in the public sector than in the
private sector. 16 pp. CONTACT: Wisconsin Policy Research Institute,

<I>Heritage Lecture</I>
No. 552, The Heritage Foundation


<P>
Steve Hanke, Professor of Applied Economics at Johns
Hopkins University and an advisor to Argentina's Minister of Economy,
compares the currency policies of Mexico and Argentina. Argentina,
according to Hanke, appears to have committed itself to maintaining
a stable currency. Mexico's monetary policy, on the other hand,
is in disarray. Hanke points out that Mexicans have called for
a sound peso, but that politicians from the three major parties
and their technocrat advisors have not been able to agree on an
exchange rate policy. So far Argentina's currency reforms seem
to be working. Hanke lays out several specific areas where Mexico
can learn and benefit from Argentina's experience. 11 pp.  CONTACT:

<B>Why Colorado Should Drop out of Goals 2000, <BR>
</B>by Sheldon Richman
<P>
<I>Issue Paper</I>
No. 2-96, The Independence Institute

<P>
Sheldon Richman, Policy Analyst at the Cato Institute,
examines each of Goals 2000's &quot;goals.&quot; He finds that
each goal will lead to more intrusion by the federal government,
and ultimately to federal control of curriculum, teaching practices,
and even facilities. Although Goals 2000 supposedly has &quot;no
power,&quot; and purports to build upon existing local efforts
to improve education, Richman argues that achievement of its goals
will require a drastic expansion of federal control. Richman also
shows that non-compliance with &quot;voluntary&quot; Goals 2000
directives could lead to litigation by the federal government
against states and local school districts. Richman focuses his
attention on Colorado's experience with Goals 2000 and the ominous
trends that followed its entry into the program. He found that
local educators and elected boards are losing their freedom to
set agendas, teach in ways they find effective, and monitor their
own progress. Richman concludes that although Goals 2000 is supposed
to bring excellence to schools, in reality it enacts increased
federal intrusion into families, communities, local school boards,
and state legislatures. 17 pp. CONTACT: Independence Institute,

In this study, Lance Izumi, Senior Fellow in California
Studies and Co-Director of the Center for Innovation in Education
at the Pacific Research Institute, and Natalie Williams, Director
of Education Affairs at the Claremont Institute, examine the fine
print in Goals 2000 and look at how this program will affect California's
public education system. Izumi and Williams find that Goals 2000
threatens to dominate and control state and local school leaders
by concentrating decision making power with a few un-elected officials
in Washington. They conclude that Goals 2000 represents &quot;devolution
in retreat&quot; and a step backward, toward the centralization
of education authority and responsibility. 28 pp.  CONTACT: The

<B>Arizona School Choice Trust: Survey of Participating

<P>
<I>Arizona Issue Analysis</I>
No. 138, Goldwater Institute

<P>
Tara Ellman, Education Consultant,
disputes some of the most widespread claims of those that oppose
school choice in this survey of participants in the Arizona School
Choice Trust (ASCT). ASCT is an organization that provides half-tuition
grants to low income parents who wish to send their children to
private schools. The survey found: low-income parents are willing
to subsidize the cost of their child's education; academics, not
religion, is the most frequently cited reason parents give for
choosing private schools; family structure  does not necessarily
dictate level of involvement in a child's education (about half
of the children participating in this program come from single
parent families); school choice programs do not result in &quot;white
flight&quot; (sixty-five percent of the participants are from
minority households); and school choice programs are not necessarily
expensive to administer (disbursement of funds for the ASCT is
done solely by volunteers, so that 100 percent of the money raised
can go to scholarships). 15 pp. CONTACT: Goldwater Institute,

<B>Restoring School Board Options on <BR>
Contracting Out, </B>by
Myron Lieberman
<P>
<I>Briefings </I>No.
1995-48, The Claremont Institute


<P>
Myron Lieberman, Chairman of the Education Policy
Institute, examines the issue of &quot;contracting out&quot; or
&quot;competitive contracting&quot; concerning school boards'
decisions on how to provide certain school services. For example,
a school board might have to make a decision whether to hire school
bus drivers and buy school buses, or to make a contract with a
transportation company to transport its students to and from school.
Lieberman shows that school boards and school board organizations
are unprepared to deal with such decisions because there has been
a massive union effort to restrict or eliminate school board freedom
to contract services. He illustrates this point by outliningthe
efforts that the National Education Association, the American
Federation of Teachers and the AFL-CIO have put forth to prevent
school boards from using the option to contract out school services,
in an effort to protect their own self interests. Lieberman concludes
that school boards &quot;should make every effort to retain or
to expand their authority to utilize contracting out.&quot; 17

<B>Are Michigan History Textbooks Reliable? <BR>

Mackinac Center
<P>
Burton Folsom, Senior Fellow in Economic Education
with the Mackinac Center, reviews four grade school textbooks
on Michigan state history. The first two texts are written for
junior high or high school students; the other two are for fourth
graders. Folsom argues that a major problem in Michigan education
today is that the textbooks used to teach Michigan history are
often times filled with distorted interpretations and omit important
historical events, figures or trends. He rates the textbooks from
one to four stars based on each text's clarity, organization,
information, balance and lack of bias. 28 pp. CONTACT: Mackinac

<B>How to Dismantle the Interior Department, <BR>
</B>by Robert Nelson
<P>
Competitive Enterprise Institute
<P>
Robert Nelson, Senior Fellow in Environmental Studies
at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, proposes a radical reorganization
of the Interior Department and its functions, based on the following
four principles: 1) activities that can reasonably be carried
out in the private sector should be done privately; 2) activities
that mostly involve state and local concerns should be administered
by state and local governments; 3) the federal government should
limit its role to activities and concerns that involve major federal
interests and responsibilities; 4) administrative organization
at the federal level should place similar functions at the same
agency. According to Nelson, the result of applying these principles
would be the abolition of six of the ten current agencies located
within the Department of the Interior, and a sharp reduction in
the size of three others. Nelson estimates that the proposed reorganization
would save roughly $3.8 billion annually. 19 pp. CONTACT: Competitive

Robert Nelson, Senior Fellow in Environmental Studies at the Competitive

Management (BLM) lands to the states. He argues that such a transfer
would improve rangeland management and restore local autonomy
in Western states. Nelson comments on current legislation on the
subject and  concludes his study by offering a series of principles
that could provide the basis for a formal transfer arrangement.

<B>The Smog-Reduction Road: Remote Sensing vs. The
Clean Air Act, </B>by

<P>
<I>Policy Analysis </I>No.
249, The Cato Institute
<P>
Daniel Klein, Assistant Professor of Economics at
the University of California at Irvine, and Pia Maria Koskenoja,
a doctoral student of transportation economics at UC Irvine, argue
that existing technology can make unpopular and burdensome vehicle
emission tests obsolete with no reduction in environmental protection.
Remote-sensing-mobile, roadside, emission sensing devices-would
prove more effective and less costly than current inspection-based
emission programs. Klein and Koskenoja point out that 20 percent
of cars on the road generate 88 percent of automobile air pollution,
and contend that current state inspection and maintenance programs
are inefficient in reducing emissions. Remote-sensing technology,
on the other hand can target the small percentage of polluting
motorists for citation by mail. The study, which is based on several
implementation plans of Los Angeles, notes that the costs of a
remote sensing system would be far less than current programs.
Klein and Koskenoja conclude by calling for amending the Clean
Air Act to allow localities to implement remote-sensing programs.

Hugh Ellsaesser, a retired scientist from the Lawrence

when managing environmental problems. Ellsaesser illustrates such
misuse in the debates concerning air pollution, stratospheric
ozone, and global warming. Ellsaesser concludes that government
bureaucrats and small cliques of politically active scientists
are helping to implement public policies that are not based on
sound science, that impose huge financial costs on hundreds of
millions of people, and that may endanger the lives of billions
of people around the world. 31 pp. CONTACT: The Heartland Institute,

<B>The State of Violent Crime in America</B>
<P>
The Council on Crime in America 
<P>
Despite a decline in crime rates in certain American
cities, according to this report the likelihood that Americans
will be victims of violent crime remains at an historic high.
The report illustrates a &quot;revolving door&quot; criminal justice
system in which one in three criminals are under the &quot;supervision&quot;
of the justice system when they commit their criminal act. It
is also shown that violent crime accounted for one-fourth of the
43.6 million criminal victimizations in America in 1993, and that
America potentially faces an explosion of juvenile crime that
will be more violent and random than anything Americans have experienced
to date. Within the next ten years the number of males aged 14-17
will increase by 23 percent, and according to the report, these
juveniles will be more crime prone than their predecessors; commit
more crimes with guns; and commit more crimes against strangers.

<B>Crime and Punishment in Texas: Update, <BR>

<I>Policy Report </I>No. 202, National Center <BR>
for Policy Analysis
<P>
According to this study by Morgan Reynolds, National
Center for Policy Analysis Senior Fellow, the reason behind the
sharp drop in the Texas crime rate is due to the increase in prisons
in which more criminals are serving more time. Reynolds points
out that the increased prison capacity in Texas means that criminals
imprisoned for serious crimes can now expect to be in jail for
a longer period of time. Reynolds finds that the overall rate
of crime in Texas has been cut by 30 percent since 1988, and compared
to 1991, the lower crime rate means that 1,140 fewer Texans will
be murdered in 1996 and 450,000 fewer serious crimes against persons
and property will be reported to police. Reynolds argues that
there is a direct link between expected punishment and the crime
rate. According to Reynolds, Texas can reduce crime even further
by continuing to raise expected punishment. 33 pp.  CONTACT: National

Michael Hartmann, Research Fellow at the Wisconsin

framework, including Wisconsin's new &quot;W-2&quot; welfare-replacement
program. He uses the ideas of  Edgar Cahn and Marvin Olasky, to
introduce the concept of volunteerism. Both Cahn and Olasky believe
that volunteerism is one of the keys to rebuilding the welfare
system and inner city decay. Hartmann concludes that Cahn's concept
of Time Dollars is something that should be used to help bring
people off of welfare rolls and into the workforce and that solutions
to social problems no longer revolve around traditional liberal
or conservative stances, but around new ideas. 35 pp.  CONTACT:

This paper examines the issue of no-fault divorce
laws in the state of Michigan. The study illustrates that although
children suffer in a divorce, the parents are no-less affected
by the breakup. According to the paper, studies have revealed
that divorced women and men suffer, to a significantly greater
degree than married persons, early death from cancer, cardiovascular
disease, strokes, pneumonia, hypertension, and suicide. The report
concludes that the divorce problem has its roots in both culture
and law, so finding solutions to the current divorce epidemic
needs to encompass both areas. 16 pp.  CONTACT: Michigan Family

Highland Beach</I> before the Maryland Court of Special Appeals.
This appeal raises the issue of whether local government can,
through zoning reclassification, deprive an owner of the use of
a lot to build a single-family home in a fully developed subdivision.
The Butchers and another family bought adjoining lots, one with
a house and the other vacant but developable. The Butchers later
sold the developed parcel and assumed the undeveloped lot with
the intention of building a new home there. The city, however,
said that a zoning ordinance enacted after the lots were originally
purchased precluded them from building on the lot. A decision
is expected to be handed down from the court this Spring.<B>

<B>Landmark Challenges State-Financed Insurance Scheme</B>
<P>
The Foundation is challenging the constitutionality
of an unprecedented government-created and subsidized insurance
company that is unfairly competing with private insurance companies
in Missouri. This &quot;corporation&quot; has the significant
advantages of a state agency, but does not have the political
accountability safeguards of a state agency. The case is expected
to be tried this summer with a likely appeal to the Missouri Supreme
Court following.<BR>

<B>Institute Lauds Decision Allowing Landowners to Exclude Trespassers</B>
<P>
The case filed by the Institute on behalf of Jon
and Josephine Bronczyk defending their private property rights
as owners of &quot;public water wetlands&quot; overcame a big
hurdle on February 5, 1996. Interpreting a Minnesota statute that
appeared to give the public access to privately owned wetlands,
Anoka County District Judge Edward W. Bearse ruled that &quot;it
appears that the plaintiffs would be justified in posting their
land 'no trespassing' and/or 'no hunting,' in seeking the removal
and prosecution of any trespassers, and in actively enforcing
all of their rights as owners of private property.&quot; The judge
granted the defendant Department of Natural Resources' (DNR) motion
for summary judgement to dismiss the case, but on the grounds
that the DNR made concessions during the lawsuit that brought
the agency into agreement with the Bronczyks, thus eliminating
the controversy.<BR>

<B>NATIONAL RIGHT TO WORK LEGAL DEFENSE FOUNDATION</B>
<P>
<B>National Right to Work Defends Against Compulsory Union Dues
for Politics</B>
<P>
After more than ten years of delay, the National
Labor Relations Board announced a key ruling in . <I>California
Saw and Knife </I>which undermines employees' legal protections
against the use of compulsory union dues for politics. The ruling
completes NLRB deliberation on over 100 charges filed by employees
against the International Association of Machinists (IAM). <BR>

<P>
The employees, some of whom initiated legal action
in October, 1985, objected to the union's use of their compulsory
union dues for politics and other activity unrelated to collective
bargaining. National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation attorneys
challenged IAM's forced unionism policy. Despite clear precedents
such as the Supreme Court's 1988 decision in <I>Communications
Workers v. Beck</I>, which allows employees to cut off the use
of their forced dues for activity unrelated to collective bargaining,
contract administration, and grievance adjustment, the NLRB developed
new legal standards governing employees in forced-unionism situations.
<BR>

<P>
Specifically, the NLRB ruled that IAM union officials'
annual &quot;notice&quot; in their internal propaganda magazine
was sufficient to satisfy an employee's right to have notice before
compulsory dues were extracted from a paycheck. In addition, the
Board held that the union can force workers to pay for activities
outside the workers' collective bargaining unit, in direct contradiction
to Supreme Court rulings in <I>Lehnert v. Ferris Faculty Association</I>
and <I>Ellis v. Brotherhood of Railway, Airline and Steamship
Clerks</I>. <BR>

<B>Of Spanish Land Grants and Federal Government Takings</B>
<P>
SLF has appeared this month as <I>amicus curiae</I>
before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in a case
that combines unique historical perspective with potential landmark
legal significance. In <I>Beggerly v. United States</I>, the appellate
court will consider the question of the validity of a Spanish
land grant predating the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 and the U.S
Department of Interior's failure to disclose the existence of
the grant during its 20-year attempt to take the land in question
<BR>

<P>
Pursuant to 1971 congressional authorization to acquire
the land as a federal park, and the Department of Interior's subsequent
below-market price offer, the federal government filed suit in
1979, claiming that Mr. Beggerly's title to the land was void
because of the alleged absence of a valid patent. Over the next
ten years, Mr. Beggerly attempted to locate evidence of title
ownership, discovering at the National Archives an 1871 Spanish
land grant conveying the property to a private landowner filed
with the U.S. Land Commissioners in 1816. His appeal, based on
the recently discovered evidence of title, challenges the lower
court ruling that no such evidence existed, and that the federal
government therefore owed Mr. Beggerly nothing for his land. An
appellate decision is expected in early Fall.<BR>

<P>
<B>Minority Set-Aside Challenge Moves Forward</B>
<P>
SLF filed suit against the Atlanta School District,
challenging the district's policy of artificially lowering minority
bids on open-bid contracts by as much as 15 percent. In <I>Prior
Tire Company v. City of Atlanta School District</I>, SLF is challenging
the set-aside program under the authority of <I>Richmond v. Croson</I>,
a landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision which held that public
contracts, whether local or state, cannot be awarded in whole
or in part based solely on race. SLF was actively involved in
the prosecution of <I>Croson</I>, and seeks to extend that ruling
to the Atlanta program.<BR>

<B>&quot;Official English&quot; Supported in Supreme Court</B>
<P>
WLF, joined by 21 Members of Congress, filed a brief asking the
Supreme Court to review the appeals court ruling in <I>Yniguez
v. Arizonans for Official English</I> that struck down Arizona's
&quot;official English&quot; law, which requires that the state
and local governments of Arizona must act in English. The law
contains exceptions allowing a government to act in a language
other than English to protect public health or safety, to protect
the rights of crime victims or criminal defendants, or to comply
with federal law, such as federal requirements that mandate bilingual
education. The appeals court held that the law was not justified
by the goal of encouraging unity and political stability, encouraging
a common language, and protecting public confidence in government
operations. WLF's brief before the Supreme Court argued that the
issue is of national significance and that states have the authority
to determine the language of government business.<BR>

<P>
<B>HUD Opposed in Attempt to Regulate Homeowner's Insurance</B>
<P>
In <I>Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co. v. Cisneros</I>,
WLF filed a brief before the U.S. Supreme Court arguing that the
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development lacks the authority
to regulate homeowner's insurance under the fair Housing Act.
WLF noted that HUD's interpretation would undermine long-standing
and legitimate insurance practices, and force consumers to bear
higher costs, by exposing insurance companies to liability for
employing standards that are not intentionally discriminatory
but that have a disparate impact on minorities. For example, many
insurers refuse to insure a property for more than its market
value; a policy that disproportionately limits insurance availability
in low-income areas where the replacement value of a home is often
more than its market value. According to WLF's brief, Congress
never intended for federal regulators to intrude on this traditional
area of state regulation.<BR>

<P>
<B>Anti-Gang Loitering Law Defended</B>
<P>
On behalf of itself, Representatives Henry Hyde and
Philip Crane, and four Chicago neighborhood associations, WLF
urged the Supreme Court of Illinois to review a decision striking
down a Chicago ordinance that prohibits members of a criminal
street gang from loitering on city streets after being directed
to &quot;move on.&quot; The ordinance was adopted in response
to strong community pressure to reduce the presence of gang members
of city streets. WLF's brief rejected the defendants' arguments
that the ordinance is unconstitutional because it is overly vague,
violates the right to freedom of assembly, and criminalizes one's
status as a gang member.<BR>

March 1996 marks the first anniversary of the <I>Unfunded

How will regulators be affected? On March 6-7, 1996, the Advisory
Commission on Intergovernmental relations will hold a Conference
on federal mandates at the Washington Hilton to address these
questions. Speakers will survey the current state of mandate reform
and recent relief measures, Congressional proposals, key issues
that will shape the course of future debate, and the real effects

<h3>February 1996 <i>Insider</i></h3>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>The Environmental
Establishment: A Status Report</FONT></B></CENTER>
<hr><P>
<font size=3>In 1996, Washington's environmental groups have reason
to congratulate themselves: they are large and influential &quot;inside-the-beltway&quot;
political organizations with very large budgets: 1994 revenues
for the Wilderness Society were over $15 million, National Audobon
Society-$36 million, Sierra Club-$43 million, National Wildlife
Federation<I>-</I>$101 million, Nature Conservancy-$307 million.</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3>Despite setbacks in Congress, the environmental movement
remains a powerful force in American politics. The organizations
that lobby and litigate receive respectful hearings in the executive
branch, the courts and in the federal bureaucracy. Environmental
groups retain the power to frustrate industrial and commercial
development and slow economic growth. As author Marek Dowie notes,
&quot;It has become virtually impossible to build a dam, open
a landfill, fire up an incinerator, drill a deep injection well,
or store nuclear waste&quot; without prompting an environmentalist
objection.</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3>But environmental groups have seen their membership
levels stabilize or fall in the 1990s. Losing grassroots support,
they are diversifying their sources of revenue. Individual membership
dues and contributions have been supplemented by corporate and
foundation grants and by commercial sales. Increasingly, green
groups are also relying on government support.</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3>Government funding has created a vicious circle:
Taxpayer dollars fund environmental groups that lobby government
for more programs that will fund more enviromental groups with
taxpayer dollars. Consider some environmental advocacy groups
that received federal grants in 1993, as reported in the Federal
Assistance Awards Data System: The Enviromental Defense Fund received
$236,000 from the EPA to support a national print and television
advertising campaign to promote recycling. The ad series slogan:
&quot;Buy Recycled and Save.&quot; The National Audubon Society
was awarded $75,998 by the EPA to run source reduction public
service announcements on television; The Natural Resource Defense
Council recieved $75,000 from the Department of the Interior to
support its Clean Water television and print advertising campaign,
which was timed to coincide with Congress's reauthorization of
the Clean Water Act; and The Nature Conservancy recieved $44,100
from the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration
for a &quot;cooperative volunteer as outreach program&quot; to
build support for the proposed Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary.
Some of the funds were used to draft congressional testimony and
to pay for campaigns to block a local public referendum on whether
to establish the sanctuary.</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3>Government legal fees and land sales are another
lucrative source of funds: Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund recently
was granted over $1 million in tax money to cover legal costs
for successful lawsuits it filed against the </FONT><font size=3>federal
government over management of public lands; and The Nature Conservancy
received over $476 million in 1993 from land sales to government
agencies. In past cases, lands have been sold at prices above
their appraised value. Such practices recently prompted property
rights activists in New York state to file a lawsuit against The
Nature Conservancy and the Adirondack Land Trust, charging that
both sold land to the state Department of Enviromental Conservation
at more than double its appraised value. </FONT>
<P>
<font size=3>Federal law prohibits use of government funds for
lobbying. But money is fungible: when tax dollars go to nonprofit
enviromental groups; more private dollars can be shifted to lobbying.
Unfortunately, efforts to halt this practice were stalled in the
last session of Congress.</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3>The modern enviromental movement that has grown up
since Earth Day in 1970 has little in common with what it once
was. Groups of hunters and outdoors people once determined what
local conservation societies would do. Now Washington professionals
and full-time activists funded by government agencies and private
philanthropies set the agenda. Groups dedicated to<I> conservation
</I>and the wise use of natural resources have been replaced by
environmental groups dominated by an ideology of <I>preservation</I>.
And conservationists who saw themselves as stewards of both the
natural environment and builders of a modern industrial society
have given way to environmental activists who often disdain technology,
industrial organization, and private sector initiatives.</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3>Still, the price of the movement's success has been
high and the likelihood of failure increases. One critic observed,
&quot;Most of these Washington organizations are paper-issue people.
They don't ask the grass roots, and they don't educate. They are
not accountable.&quot; Radical grassroots activists who are impatient
with Washington deal making are breaking away. Local property
owners are organizing their own groups to defend their rights
and fight harmful policies. Some in the media have grown skeptical
of environmentalist claims. And political candidates are running
and winning campaigns against evironmental extremism.</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3>An energetic advocacy for free market environmental
ideas offers the best answer to the bloated organizations and
failed polices of the current establishment. Americans want environmental
protection, but they also want a growing economy, secure property
rights, and a clear sense that they are in control of their lives.

<i>Land Rights: The 1990's Property Rights Rebellion</i><BR>
Edited by Bruce Yandle, Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1995, 333 pp.
<HR>

<P>
&quot;Upon the sacredness of property, civilization itself depends.&quot; -- Andrew
Carnegie
<P>
 In <I>Land Rights:  The 1990s' Property Rights Rebellion</I>,
the authors remind us of the primary role of private property
in a democracy.  This nine essay collection describes how excessive
environmental regulation can infringe private property rights
and effectively violate the Fifth Amendment's guarantee that &quot;nor
shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.&quot;
 In the first chapter, &quot;The Property Rights Movement:  How
It Began and Where It Is Headed,&quot; by Nancie G. Marzulla,
President of Defenders of Property Rights, the author presents
an interesting history of the modern property rights movement.
 Marzulla contends that the modern assault on private property
rights began in 1970 with two events:  the first celebration of
Earth Day and the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency.
 These two events helped spawn a regulatory nightmare for many
innocent property owners.  Marzulla recalls the story of a Florida
man, Ocie Mills, who was imprisoned for 21-months for dumping
sand on his <I>own</I> property.  The sand filled a wetland and
thereby violated the Clean Water Act -- even though a federal judge
later ruled that Mills' land was &quot;probably not&quot; a wetland
under the Act.
<P>
 Marzulla's most interesting point, however, is the following.
The property rights movement is not seeking less environmental
protection -- it merely asks that the few unfortunate landowners
who do lose their property to regulation will no longer be forced
to bear an unfair share of the burden.  Marzulla persuasively
argues that private property is not only not inconsistent with
environmental protection but can actually enhance respect for
the environment by avoiding the tragedy of the commons phenomena
that often accompanies public lands.  
<P>
 In the essay, &quot;The Lucas Case and the Conflict over Property
Rights&quot; James R. Rinehart and Jeffrey J. Pompe explain how
an obscure developer became a poster child for the property rights
movement.  In 1986, David Lucas bought two oceanfront lots near
Charleston, S.C. for approximately $1 million.  At the time, there
were no regulations or laws that would have prevented Lucas from
building a single-family home on the property.  However, in 1988,
South Carolina passed the Beachfront Management Act.  The Act
created a new building setback line that completely prevented
Lucas from developing his property.  In sum, the Act, which did
not contain a grandfather clause, made the two lots worthless.
 Although the state did not officially seize title to Lucas' land,
like so many environmental regulations, it restricted the owner's
ability to use the land to such an extent as to constitute a &quot;taking&quot;
under the Fifth Amendment.  Finally, after four years of tortuous
litigation, $500,000 in legal fees, and an appeal to the U.S.
Supreme Court, Lucas won the case.  The state of South Carolina
was forced to buy the land for market value.  
<P>
 The Lucas case, the authors remind us, represents the key issue
in the environment movement.  When excessive government regulation
inflicts pain on some individuals while benefiting others, who
should bear the costs of the regulation?  The authors argue that
from an equitable perspective, a property owner like Lucas should
not be forced to bear the total cost of a regulation that benefits
everyone, even if the aggregate benefits exceed the property owner's
costs.  Ironically, when the state of South Carolina was forced
to buy Lucas' land, it was faced with a dilemma:  Either develop
the property and protect its expensive investment, or do not develop
property and own two worthless lots.  The state tried to force
the latter option on David Lucas.  Once it owned the property,
however, it hypocritically sold the lots to the highest bidder
for development-an option it denied David Lucas. 
<P>
 The book reminds readers of the importance of a Chief Executive
who is committed to balancing environmental protection with property
rights.  The authors recall how President Reagan appointed officials
who brought a cooperative, common sense attitude toward industry
and property owners.  In the authors view, Reagan officials such
as James Watt as Secretary of the Interior and Anne Gorsuch as
the Environmental Protection Agency Administrator maintained a
proper balance between environmental protection and property rights
that benefited all Americans.  The authors contrast the Reagan
Administration with the heavily regulatory and bureaucratic Bush
and Clinton Administrations.  For example, the book points out
that under Bush appointee William Reilly, the EPA broadened the
definition of &quot;navigable waters.&quot;  This regulatory change
redefined land that held water for only short periods of time
each year as &quot;wetlands&quot; -- doubling the land over which
the federal government exercises control from 100 to 200 million
acres.  This regulatory change vastly expanded the federal government's
control over private property under the Clean Water Act.

 For serious students of public policy, <I>Land Rights: The 1990s'
Property Rights Rebellion </I>is well worth the read.

<font size=3>Heritage Policy Analyst John Hillen writes that NATO's
involvement in the peace operation in Bosnia is a clear signal
that the Atlantic Alliance has strayed far from its original mission
of preventing the domination of Europe by a hostile power. Hillen

alliance of collective security, and calls for a NATO Revitalization
Act to refocus the alliance and preserve American support for
the U.S. role in Europe. 14 pp.  CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The

<font size=3>This issue features a series of articles on the subject
of foreign policy in the '96 presidential race. The first, <I>The
U.S. Electoral Cycle since 1944</I> by David Eisenhower, argues
that U.S. foreign policy will not be a major issue in the 1996
presidential race. In <I>The Populist Revival and Foreign Affairs</I>
by A.J. Bacevich, it is argued that the political realignment
established in the 1994 elections, though not caused by foreign
policy issues, will have substantial implications for future American
diplomacy. Bacevich believes that a populist tide will oppose
a global agenda. In <I>Even Foreign Policy Is a Local Affair</I>,
author Patrick Lloyd Hatcher believes that foreign policy issues,
will indeed, play a large role in the 1996 campaign, as the free
trade/isolationism and downsizing/defense contracts issues will
be of interest to local constituencies. 52 pp.  CONTACT: Foreign

calls for Israel to give up U.S. aid so that it may establish
its economic independence. He argues that Israel's apparent economic
success is only a facade. The real story, according to Rabushka,
is that &quot;Israel is besieged by one economic crisis after
another: power failures, bankrupt kibbutzim, a perpetual housing
crisis, confiscatory taxation, trade restrictions, a massive trade
deficit in both goods and services, budget deficits, high interest
rates, one failed attempt after another at privatization, and
so on.&quot; Despite these chronic problems,  Rabushka notes that
Israel has been able to sustain unparalleled growth for one simple
reason, Israelis live off the money of others-totaling $9 billion
and equaling one-eighth of all goods and services that Israelis
consume. 8 pp. CONTACT: Institute for Advanced Strategic and Political

<P>
<font size=3>Allan Meltzer, Visiting Scholar at AEI, comments
on recent financial troubles in Mexico and reviews the chain of
events that have lead to Mexico's unstable economy. Despite positive
economic forecasts in 1994 with the approval of NAFTA, the year
ended with a damaged political structure, major devaluation of
the peso and an overall policy failure. According to Meltzer,
the major players in the tragic events in Mexico were high officials
in the Mexican and U.S. governments and the International Monetary
Fund. Meltzer outlines what Mexico should have done as well as
lessons to be learned from the events of 1994-1995. He concludes
that the role of governments and international agencies in international

<font size=3>A clause buried deep in the 300-page Telecom Bill
requires the FCC to carry out an ill-concieved plan to <I>give
</I>America's broadcast industry additional licenses to use part
of the electromagnetic spectrum to broadcast digital televison
services. Experts at the FCC have estimated that <I>auctioning</I>
off the spectrum could raise as much as $70 billion. According
to Thierer &amp; Barry, $70 billion could pay for the following:
1) three years of the congressionally approved $500-per-child
tax credit that benefits 28 million families raising 51 million
children; 2) the entire economic growth tax package proposed by
Congress, including the capital gains tax cut; or 3) $70 billion
in debt reduction that would save taxpayers nearly $3 billion
each year in interest payments on the national debt. Thierer &amp;

<font size=3>The Consumer Federation of America issued a report
in October that claimed that the telecommunications bills in Congress
would cost American consumers billions of dollars. According to
Wayne Leighton, Regulatory Economist at Citizens for a Sound Economy,
this analysis is faulty and based on a misunderstanding of the
legislation and the effects of regulatory reform in telecommunications.
Leighton argues that deregulation and competition would save consumers
money, while overall efficiency gains could total $30 billion.

<font size=3>The American Legislative Exchange Council proposes
four principles for free market reform in telecommunications 
that should be adapted by each state to fit its own unique statutes,
circumstances and time frames: 1) competition, not regulation,
should shape the telecommunications industry; 2) where regulation
is necessary, it should be competitively neutral and equally applied
to all providers; 3) universal service should be preserved; and
4) all providers should be permitted to compete in all markets.
ALEC belivieves that these four principles are a way to ensure
that consumers get the greatest benefit from telecommunications
innovations by encouraging competition and opening markets. 8

<P>
<font size=3>This study looks at the strategy employed by labor
unions known as a &quot;corporate campaign.&quot; Capital Research
Center Senior Fellow Thomas DiLorenzo illustrates how a &quot;corporate
campaign&quot; organized by a group calling itself Consumers United
with Employees (CUE) was really a public relations ploy against
Food Lion backed by the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW).
 A tactic used by CUE to smear the reputation of Food Lion was
to use headline grabbing press releases that claimed that a &quot;study&quot;
of Food Lion had &quot;discovered&quot; instances of health violations
within the chain. The reports attempted to mislead the media by
only citing Food Lion errors-some legitimate, some questionable-while
omitting the fact that other grocery chains have similar lapses
in procedures. DiLorenzo writes that the tactics used by the UFCW
do not help the consumer as they claim, instead, they cause the
price of groceries to climb by running the low-price, non-union
chains out of business. 8 pp.  CONTACT: Capital Research Center,

<font size=3>Richard Vedder, John M. Olin Visiting Professor of
Labor Economics at CSAB, and Lowell Gallaway, Distinguished Professor
of Economics at Ohio University, illustrate the racial implications
of the Davis-Bacon Act (which requires contractors of federally
funded projects to pay union scale, or &quot;prevailing&quot;
wages). Vedder and Galloway write that the bill was originally
crafted to protect northern white labor against cheaper black
labor from other regions. In addition, they suggest that the legislation
was not race-neutral in its impact, and very likely has caused
a lack of minority participation in the construction industry.
Vedder and Gallaway give a full historical background on the enactment
of the legislation, including the fact that in the two decades
before the passage of Davis-Bacon there was a significant  growth
in the number of black employees outside the South in major construction
crafts. The study concludes that Davis-Bacon, like other minimum
wage laws, has increased unemployment for all groups; but its
negative impact has affected black construction workers disproportionately.

<P>
<font size=3>In the state of Michigan, the worker's compensation
system was developed as a way for workers who suffer on-the-job
physical injuries to be quickly and fairly compensated for medical
costs and lost income. In recent years, however, an ambiguous
new area of law has developed under workman's compensation that
allows workers to claim injuries due to alleged on-the-job mental
stress. This has lead to complications in Michigan as how to judge
properly whether a claimant is worthy of compensation. This report
illustrates how the worker's compensation system works, its problems
with claims for mental stress injuries, the history of case and
statutory law regarding mental stress, and where the issue stands
today after a crucial 1994 Michigan Supreme Court decision. 36

<P>
<font size=3>Robert Poole, President of the Reason Foundation,
argues that cities could save millions of dollars and improve
response times to 911 emergency calls by privatizing Emergency
Medical Service. In Los Angeles alone, the cost to the taxpayer
for these services is $45.6 million a year. Reason estimates that
contracting with a private provider for certain EMS/paramedic
services would reduce the cost to taxpayers by two-thirds. Poole
concludes that cities and counties should reorganize their EMS
systems by creating a public-private partnership in which the
fire department provides first response service and private ambulance
firms provide all paramedic treatment and transport for all 911
medical calls. The results, according to Poole, would be reduction
of cost to the taxpayer, greater accountability, and quicker response
times. 18 pp. CONTACT: Reason Foundation, 3415 S. Sepulveda Blvd.,

for the federal government, asset divestiture and infrastructure
partnerships. Poole illustrates how such federal enterprises as
the U.S. Postal Service and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting
can be privatized, and lists federal assets, such as commodity
lands, defense reserves, the strategic petroleum reserve, and
government buildings and land that could be utilized better under
private ownership. Poole also discusses the subject of infrastructure
partnership and how the federal government can promote private
ownership and operation of infrastructure. He concludes his testimony
with five general principles for privatization and summarizes
the issues associated with implementing a privatization agenda.

<font size=3>Progressive intellectuals, according to trade attorney
Brink Lindsey, corrupted capitalism by convincing Americans that
bigger is best for labor, business, and government. However, Lindsay
argues that the triumvirate of Big Government, Big Business, and
Big Labor is collapsing. Big Labor has seen this change first,
as unionization of the private sector labor force decline from
36 percent in 1953 to only 11 percent today. Meanwhile, large
American corporations, argued to be immune from market forces
by intellectuals in the 1960s, have been &quot;restructured&quot;
or &quot;reengineered&quot; in the form of middle-management layoffs.
Now, writes Lindsey, it is Big Government's turn. 10 pp. CONTACT:

the next seven years than the same plan would without tax cuts;
furthermore, the cuts in taxes on capital (including the capital

and leads to a stronger economy in the long run. This report also

<font size=3>Citizens for a Sound Economy Analyst Rebbeca Schaefer
argues that a flat tax would not negatively affect the housing
market. While real estate lobbyists claim that the housing market
would be hurt by a  flat tax because it eliminates the mortgage
interest deduction, Schaefer illustrates that families and individuals
do not buy homes because of the tax incentive of a mortgage interest
deduction. Instead, people buy homes for many other reasons: to
relocate, to have more living space, to downsize living space,
to find a better community, etc. Schaefer presents economic evidence
suggesting that a flat tax would bring a drop in mortgage interest
rates by at least 2 percentage points, more than compensating
for the loss of the interest deduction. 8 pp.  CONTACT: Citizens

that high, progressive taxes suppress capital formation, increase
inequality, and reduce real tax receipts. He calls for an increase
in the incentives to save and invest, with time and money, in
education and training. A low flat tax, according to Reynolds,
would increase the economy's stock of economic and human capital,

of administration, cost-overrun reserves, social services, and
subsidies to bankrupt firms. He warns against the type of growth
that Israel had between 1993 and 1995, which according to Klein,
was due to excess consumption-driven largely by the government's
ever-increasing budgets. The results of this increase in government
spending has been a large trade deficit and foreign debt, high
inflation, and declining productivity, savings and competitiveness.

<font size=3>In this article, New York University Professor Lawrence
Mead examines why Wisconsin's welfare caseload declined 26% since
reforms and new programs were enacted in 1987. According to state
figures, welfare in the average Wisconsin county fell 42%, while
some small counties recorded decreases of as much as 66%. Mead
found that the decline in welfare recipients was due less to Wisconsin's
now thriving economy and more to the priority that reforms placed
on self reliance. Furthermore, Mead writes that Governor Thompson's
conservative, but not necessarily anti-government, policy was
successful in changing the attitudes of most welfare personnel.
Indeed, most welfare officials, according to Mead, appreciated
that the Governor challenged them with the responsibility of getting
recipients to work, rather than just handing out aid. 8 pp.  CONTACT:

<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">Jacob Sullum, Senior Editor
of <I>Reason</I>, argues that the public health establishment's
attempt to prevent illness and injury by controlling certain high-risk
behaviors, such as smoking and alcohol is misleading and a threat
to personal freedom. He argues that when public health officials
assume that certain behaviors are unhealthy, they &quot;treat
adults like incompetent children.&quot; Even when people know
about hazards, to smoke, drink and behave in certain ways not
recommended by the health establishment, they continue not becuse
they misunderstand, but because &quot;for the sake of pleasure,
utility, or convenience, they are prepared to accept the risks.&quot;

Olasky illustrates the daily activities of several homeschool

do not have strong enough academic standards. Regardless of the
reason. However, Olasky maintains that homeschooling has proven
very successful at educating children</FONT><I><font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">-</FONT></I><font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">to
the consternation of the education establishment. At last year's
NEA convention, members voted in an anti-homeschool resolution

<P>
<font size=3>David Kopel, Research Director at the Independence
Institute, and Sheldon Richman, Policy Analyst with the Cato Institute,
argue that the issue of compulsory schooling needs serious reconsideration.
Kopel and Richman point out that early proponents of compulsory
education often implied in their advocacy that the home was a
bad influence on children, particularly children of working-class
and immigrant families. Most people, according to Kopel and Richman,
are unaware that the compulsory education system was designed
to save children from the bad influence of their parents. The
paper shows that education in the days before government compulsion
produced high rates of literacy. Kopel and Richman point out problems
with compulsory schooling and how it harms education, as well
as dealing with the issue of irresponsible parents. 16 pp. CONTACT:

<font size=3>In the lead story of this issue, Becky Norton Dunlop,

the Fifth Amendment against environmentalists who want to water
down its stance on protecting property. Despite the fact that
the Constitution states that no person shall be &quot;deprived
of life, liberty, or property without due process of the law,&quot;
Dunlop describes people who will argue that &quot;a higher good
is served when society places certain restrictions on property
rights rather than slavishly adhering to the Fifth Amendment's
exhortation.&quot; Dunlop suggests  that those who support the
Bill of Rights have the responsibility to fight the charges by
environmentalists that property rights advocates are just rich
developers who want free reign to pollute as they please. 13 pp.

<P>
<font size=3>Unintended consequences of environmental laws, especially
the federal Superfund law, has led to the proliferation of so-called
brownfield sites in American cities. Brownfield sites are &quot;abandoned
or vacant commercial and industrial properties suspected of containing
at least low levels of environmental contamination.&quot; Such
sites have lost potential developers to fears that a consequence
of owning and cleaning up a site will be state or federal liability
and regulation. Therefore, &quot;lenders will not lend, developers
will not develop, and buyers will not buy.&quot; Citizens for
a Sound Economy Policy Analyst Michael Harrold calls for Superfund's
liability and cleanup standards to be fundamentally reformed.
Until then, concludes Harrold, neither the states and EPA, nor
developers and lenders, will have the assurances or authority
under law to bring solutions to the brownfield problem. 18 pp.

<P>
<font size=3>Despite vast improvements in air quality since the
1990 Clean Air Act Amendments, this paper reports that environmentalists
and the American Lung Association are quietly pressuring EPA to
establish a new standard for measuring safe levels of ozone<I>-</I>one
that will be more costly to meet, but may produce little, or no,
meaningful health benefits. Authors Kenneth Chilton, Director
of the Center, and Christopher Boerner, CSAB Fellow, note that
people are already frustrated under the current policy. Programs
such as centralized vehicle inspection and maintenance will increase
the hassle to drivers but may not be an improvement over existing
decentralized programs. Ozone requirements increase costs to individuals
via higher prices and taxes, and impact small businesses more
than large firms. Chilton and Boerner recommend that Congress
revisit the Clean Air Act and allow cost and benefits to be considered
in setting the ozone standard. They conclude: &quot;Unless chronic
effects of prolonged exposures to elevated ozone can be demonstrated
(and after two-and-a-half decades of research, they have not been),
the United States is already spending more taxpayer and consumer
dollars on reducing ozone than the public considers worthwhile.&quot;

<P>
<font size=3>Patrick Fagan, William H.G. FitzGerald Fellow at
Heritage, has found that nearly every major study on the impact
of religion demonstrates its positive impact on a host of social
problems. He gives evidence that religious practice strengthens
the family and brings satisfaction to marriage; helps poor people
move out of poverty; aids substantially in the formation of personal
moral judgement; and inoculates individuals against such social
problems as suicide, drug abuse, out-of-wedlock births, crime
and divorce. According to Fagan, Washington policy-makers should
consider the enormous contribution religion can make toward solving
America's major social problems. Fagan offers several steps that
Congress and the President can take to encourage religious practice,
including: the initiation of a national discussion on the need
to restore the role of religion in American life; passage of a
resolution affirming the census data on the extent of religious
practice; and the appointment of judges who are at least more
sensitive to the role of religion in public life. 29 pp.  CONTACT:

to the report, the ultimate intention of the survey was to take

have failed to communicate their message to the black community;
2) the political labels of &quot;conservative&quot; and &quot;liberal&quot;
are meaningless in the dialogue, because action is what counts;
and 3) language and perception account for most differences, while
position on most issues are similar. 20 pp. CONTACT: Foundation

state officials should not rely too heavily on the Court as the

1) the recent American experience with federalism; 2) the forces

considering ideas about where the federalsim debate should go
from here. He concludes by writing that restoring federalism requires
at least major legislation, if not a constitutional amendment
to restore power and relationships destroyed by the seventeenth
amendment, which removed state legislatures' authority to elect
U.S. Senators. Burgess warns that whatever approach is taken,
the pursuit of principle-centered remedies and not quick fixes

power in fundamental law, and to restore constitutional government.
Pilon recommends that Congress take the following actions to achieve
this end: 1) declare that the Constitution remains a document
of limited federal powers; 2) declare that most of what the federal
government does today is done without constitutional authority;
3) identify the precise constitutional authority for doing so
before enacting any new legislation; 4) restore the Commerce Clause
to its original purpose; 5) restore the General Welfare Clause
to its original purpose; 6) restore the Necessary and Proper clause
to its orignal purpose; and 7)  restore those provisions of the
Bill of Rights and the Civil War Amendments that have fallen into
disregard-privileges and immunities, property rights, and economic
liberties. 24 pp.  CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts

The Swedish economists Ingemar St&aring;hl and Kurt Wickman discuss
the factors that have contributed to the crisis in the Swedish
economy and introduce the terms &quot;relative price shock&quot;
and &quot;relative interest shock.&quot; In 1994's <I>Suedosclerosis
II</I>, St&aring;hl and Wickman argue that the Swedish crisis
is deeper and the adjustments slower than in comparable countries.
They conclude that political responsibility must be transfered

changes in the welfare systems are necessary in order to abolish
the politics of high taxation. This particular publication contains

<B>Senators Challenge Executive Order</B>
<P>
<font size=3>ALF represents United States Senators Paul Coverdell
of Georgia and Slade Gorton of Washington in a challenge to President
Clinton's Executive Order that bars federal agencies from doing
business with companies which hire permanent striker replacements.
Through the brief, the two  Senators take the position that the
Executive Order violates the principle of separation of powers
in that the question of striker replacements involves labor policy
which is the prerogative of Congress to establish. In fact, Congress
years ago established such a policy in the National Labor Relations
Act in an effort to counter-balance the power of the labor unions
to call strikes. <BR>

<B>ALF Urges that Exposure to EMF Does Not Cause Discernible Harm</B>
<P>
<font size=3>Representing 14 distinguished scientists, including
5 Nobel laureates, ALF submitted a brief in the Supreme Court
of California involving a question of whether exposure to electromagnetic
fields can cause cancer. The scientists conclude that the evidence
does not justify the fears advanced by the plaintiffs in an action
against San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. that low intensity electromagnetic
fields from power lines can cause cancer.<BR>

<B>CIR Sues University for Speech Violation</B>
<P>
<font size=3>The Center and co-counsels, representing the Florida
ACLU and the Southeastern Legal Foundation, are representing Gerald
Gee, a professor at Florida A&amp;M University who was suspended
without pay for an in-class remark allegedly constituting discrimination
and harassment. In illustrating a point, the professor used the
term &quot;nigger&quot; although he did not direct the term at
any individual. At issue in this case is whether Gee's remark
to his students is protected under the scope of academic freedom.
After CIR brought a lawsuit in early 1995, asserting claims under
both the Equal Protection and Free Speech clauses of the U.S.
Constitution, and sought a preliminary injunction revoking the
suspension, Florida A&amp;M agreed to rescind the remaining portions
of Gee's suspension. Professor Gee's claims for damages and further
injunctive relief are pending before the district court.<BR>

<B>Update on CIR's Sex Discrimination Appeal</B>
<P>
<font size=3>The Center is representing five male professors at
Virginia Commonwealth University who claimed sex discrimination
when the school gave a raise to only female professors in 1992.
This summer, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the
lower court's decision that granted summary judgment to VCU. The
Court of Appeals held that the case should go to trial since the
pay raise was justified by a &quot;salary equity test&quot; that
failed to take into account such critical factors as teaching
performance, publications, and service to the community. However,
the full Fourth Circuit granted VCU's petition to rehear the case
<I>en banc</I>.<BR>

<B>Defenders Seeks to Protect Landowners</B>
<P>
<font size=3>For over a hundred years, the boundaries for some
parcels of land owned in Kamiah, Idaho have been established and
respected. Yet, it turns out that the title descriptions in their
deeds do not reflect these boundaries. At the turn of the century,
a county surveyor believed the original title descriptions to
be erroneous. Based solely on his affidavit-and without conducting
an on-the-ground survey-the U.S. patent office unilaterally amended
the title descriptions in 1901. The property involved in this
dispute, however, has recently become highly desirable for development.
Moreover, it was once part of the Nez Perce Indian Reservation.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">Last December, Bureau of Indian
Affairs (BIA) issued Trespass Notices to eight Idaho residents.
Many more stand to lose the land which they have maintained and
paid taxes on for a half century, for the heirs to the original
members of the Nez Perce Tribe are claiming that the error in
the fee patent means that they own the land-not the people (and
their predecessors on interest) who have owned it since 1953.
BIA agrees and is intervening on behalf of the Indian heirs, asserting
that the present owners are trespassing on Indian land.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">If BIA succeeds in removing
the current occupants, the Indians whose interests the government
claims to represent will not retain title. The land has already
been sold to a developer. If BIA does not remove the current owners,
however, the Indian Law unit of the Legal Services Corporation-which
is representing the Indians free of charge-will sue BIA for failure
to protect the Indian heirs' rights.</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">Defenders is asking Interior
Secretary Babbitt to exercise his discretion to amend the patents
to reflect the original and accurate 1873 descriptions, and the
actual use by all owners for an entire century.<BR>

<B>Defenders Attempts to Stop <BR>
Wetlands Witch Hunt</B>
<P>
<font size=3>Defenders has filed a brief <I>amicus curiae</I>
on behalf of itself and two dozen grassroots property rights organizations
asking the U.S. District Court of Maryland to dismiss criminal
charges against James L.Wilson and his company, Interstate General.
This case bears a remarkable resemblance to the criminal prosecution
of Bill Ellen, a wetlands consultant who spent six months in a
federal penitentiary in 1992 for filling wetlands without a permit.
Now, the same prosecutor is gunning for Mr. Wilson. Defenders
is working with the defendant's private criminal counsel to have
the prosecution thrown out on a variety of grounds. Defenders
argued that the criminal charges brought for the filling of isolated
wetlands in this case are unconstitutional under the Fifth Amendment.

<font size=3>Defenders has filed a brief <I>amicus</I> <I>curiae</I>
in the U.S. Court of Appeals in the case of <I>Outdoor Graphics,
Inc. v. City of Burlington, Iowa</I>, arguing that a five-year
amortization period does not constitute &quot;just compensation&quot;
under the Fifth Amendment for the taking of private property.
At issue in this case is a 1988 city ordinance that outlawed the
construction of billboards within city limits. The city did not,
however, actually require Outdoor Graphics to take down its signs
until 1993. That grace (or &quot;amortization&quot;) period, the
city asserts, was the property owner's &quot;just compensation&quot;
for the destruction of the company's business.<BR>

<P>
<B>IJ Takes on Government Assault of Sanctity of the Home and
Right to Exclude</B>
<P>
<font size=3>The Institute for Justice has filed a lawsuit against
the Village of Park Forest (a suburb of Chicago), for allowing,
under its housing code, government inspectors to conduct warrantless
searches of single-family rental homes without tenant consent
or notice. The suit was filed on behalf of several Park Forest
tenants seeking to vindicate their private property rights under
the Fourth Amendment. The resulting decision from the case could
set a national precedent to bolster protection for the right of
property owners to exclude outsiders from their property. Government
inspectors, wishing to enter a tenant's home, will need to ask
for and receive either the explicit consent of tenants or, if
consent is denied, a search warrant based on some reasonable belief
that the housing code is being violated.<BR>

<b>Cleveland Becomes Second Battleground <BR>
for School Choice</b>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">The Ohio Federation of Teachers
filed a suit to secure an injunction against the nation's second
school choice program, due to commence this Fall, in Cleveland.
The program provides, among other features, vouchers of approximately
$2,250 for about 1,500 low-income children in grades K-3 to attend
private schools. The program has attracted more than 50 schools
and 6,550 applicants-1,500 of whom were selected through a lottery
system. The lawsuit, styled <I>Gatton v. Goff</I>, challenges
the program on state and federal constitutional grounds. The primary
focus is establishment of religion. The Institute worked closely
with Governor Voinovich as the plan was developed, and having
worked in the Cleveland low-income community since last summer,
is preparing to intervene on behalf of Hope for Cleveland's Children,
the Hough Academy of Higher Learning, and individual families.

<B>Federal Circuit to Rehear <I>Preseault</I> Case</B>
<P>
<font size=3>In an unusual action, the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the Federal Circuit has vacated and will now rehear the <I>Preseault</I>
case. This overturns a recent decision by two judges of that court
who had held that Paul and Patricia Preseault had no remedy for
the United States' action in converting an abandoned railroad
right of way across their land into a heavily traveled public
recreational trail. The now-vacated decision had severely undercut
landowners' rights to seek compensation from the federal government
for &quot;taking&quot; their property. The court held that a party
was required to sue the government immediately after passage of
any law that &quot;foreshadowed&quot; a future taking. In the
Preseaults'<I> </I>case, that meant that they would have had to
sue in 1920, 60 years before the trail was even built. The new
decision breaths life back into over a dozen takings cases which
are following in the Preseaults' tracks. It is a major setback
for the government's effort to obtain rights over private land
without having to pay for those rights.</FONT>

<B>NELF to File <I>Amicus </I>Brief in <BR>
<B>Unemployment Case</B></B>
<P>
<font size=3>NELF will file a friend of the court brief for the
Connecticut Business and Industry Association in support of Yankee
Gas System's appeal of a decision ordering it to pay unemployment
benefits to striking workers.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">The case involves a 1992 labor
dispute. Yankee offered workers a small raise and reserved the
right to change its medical insurance program in the future in
a manner the workers opposed. Negotiations broke down and workers
went on strike. During the strike the company kept operating,
using managers and some replacement workers. Three months later
the strike ended and the workers returned.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">A state agency has now characterized
the strike as a &quot;lockout&quot; and ordered Yankee to pay
unemployment benefits for the duration of the strike. The agency
found that the company's final offer was inferior to the prior
contract under which the workers were willing to keep working.
Both points are dubious. The new contract offered a modest raise
as well as the health insurance change, Furthermore, the agreement
to keep working was illusory since Yankee's workers reserved the
right to strike at any time they found more tactically convenient.
NELF's brief will focus on the decision's impact in shifting the
balance in labor disputes toward labor.<BR>

<B>NELF Represents Maine Oil Dealer</B>
<P>
<font size=3>NELF will represent Conrad Thibeault, a Maine fuel
dealer who voluntarily cleaned up some spilled oil on his property
and now is being made to pay for his good deed. When he discovered
the spill, Mr. Thibeault notified the state Departmnet of Enviromental
Protection, negotiated a cleanup plan and then actually cleaned
up the site. Only then did DEP tell Mr. Thibeault that it would
not reimburse him for 70% of the cleanup costs which it now felt
had gone to improving the property as well as cleaning it up.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">Maine has an Oil Clean-up
Fund which is derived from fees paid by oil dealers like Mr. Thibeault.
The Fund was created to reimburse people for &quot;any expenses
involved&quot; in oil spill cleanups. The law contains not a word
about denying reimbursement if a cleanup also has the incidental
benefit of improving the property.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">NELF will appeal Mr. Thibeault's
case to the Fund Insurance Review Board and argue that when the
state approves the details of particular cleanup plans, it cannot
later renege and refuse to reimburse a person who in good faith
implemented the plan and cleaned up a spill. The state's policy
is shortsighted. It is not only unfair, but counterproductive.
If it becomes common practice, it will eliminate any incentive
for voluntary spill cleanups.<BR>

<B>NELF to Support Punitive Damages Appeal</B>
<P>
<font size=3>For decades it has been a common practice in the
telephone industry for field workers to carry their lunches to
the job site. Workers were given 30 minutes to eat lunch on the
site, but were not paid for that time.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">The U.S. Labor Department
sued Southern New England Telecommunications, a Connecticut phone
company, claiming that its failure to pay workers for lunch breaks
violated the Fair Labor Standards Act. A federal judge agreed
and ordered the company to end the practice and to pay workers
over $4 million in back pay and overtime. The judge also held
that the violation was &quot;willful&quot; and therefore he doubled
the amount of damages to $9 million as a penalty<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">NELF will file an <I>amicus</I>
brief opposing the punitive double damages. The policy of not
providing paid lunches may not have been consistent with federal
law, but in light of the universal, decades-long practice in the
industry it cannot reasonably have been a &quot;willful&quot;
violation of the law. The U.S. Court of Appeals in New York will
hear the case.<BR>

<B>Washington Supreme Court Gives Lip Service to Landowner's Rights</B>
<P>
<font size=3>Despite the U.S. Supreme Court's unequivocal ruling
last June in <I>Dolan v. City of Tigard</I>, a Washington property
owner was unable to receive the benefits of that landmark decision
when the Washington Supreme Court applied <I>Dolan</I> in such
a manner as to render the precedent-setting decision meaningless.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">Douglas County, Washington,
approved a 16-lot residential subdivision on the condition that
the owner dedicate various strips of land for future road widening.
Relying on the <I>Dolan </I>decision, the Court of Appeals found
the exaction to be an unconstitutional taking, since there was
no showing that the new homes would create any need to widen the
roads. The Washington Supreme Court thought otherwise.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">Under <I>Dolan</I>, when government
requires the dedication of land in exchange for a permit, it must
<I>prove</I> that the particular land dedication at issue is &quot;roughly
proportional&quot; to any harm caused by the project being permitted.
Government has the burden of proof and must make an &quot;individualized
determination that the required dedication is related both in
nature and extent to the impact of the proposed development.&quot;
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">This case presented the first
opportunity for the Washington Supreme Court to consider this
&quot;rough proportionality&quot; test established in <I>Dolan</I>
and the type of information that is sufficient to justify an exaction
of land in return for a building permit. Unfortunately, the Washington
Supreme Court did not require any calculations of proportionality.
It simply upheld the land exactions based on the general increase
in traffic attributable to the development.<BR>

on him as a condition for receiving a permit to construct a housing
development.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">A ruling in favor of Mr. Ehrlich
could substantially limit local government's exactions of so-called
&quot;mitigation&quot; or &quot;linkage&quot; fees from private
development to finance unrelated public programs. PLF is striving

operated a private tennis club but was unable to make a financial
success of it. In 1988, he closed the facility and donated most
of the movable equipment to the city and proposed a townhouse
condominium project on the property. The City Council approved
the project on condition that Mr. Ehrlich pay $280,000, which
the city estimated was the cost of building replacement tennis
courts.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">PLF contends that the fee
is unconstitutional because it fails the rough proportionality
test laid down in the <I>Dolan</I> case.  The <I>Ehrlich</I> case
differs in that the property owner is being asked to come up with
cash instead of land.<BR>

<font size=3>SLF is proceeding with its parental rights lawsuit
in <I>Earles v. Stephens County School District, et. al., </I>which
is currently before the U.S. District Court. Filed on behalf of
the parents of two teenage sisters, the lawsuit challenges the
constitutionality of the school administration's actions in transporting
the minor girls during school hours to a local public health clinic,
where the girls received HIV/AIDS tests, PAP smear tests, condoms,
and prescription birth control pills-all without parental consent
or notification. The parents have been denied access to the results
of the tests.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">National media attention has
focused on this case as a lightning rod for the parental rights
debate in this country. SLF attorneys testified before a joint
U.S. House and Senate committee, which is considering proposed
parental rights legislation, on the constitutional status of the
parental right to direct and control the education and upbringing

<B>Business Owner Liability Gets Helping Hand</B>

<font size=3>In a victory for Georgia businesses and property
owners, the Georgia Supreme Court overturned a state Court of
Appeals decision, which held that property owners were charged
with constructive knowledge of criminal acts previously committed
on their property as part of their duty of ordinary care. The
Court of Appeals decision had made businesses liable for every
criminal act committed on their property, whether reasonably foreseeable
or not.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">In <I>Sun Trust Banks v. Killebrew</I>,
SLF argued as <I>amicus curiae</I> that any relaxation of the
doctrine of ordinary care would exacerbate the plight of those
property owners and businesses who are least able to protect their
own property, let alone their patrons. The Georgia Supreme Court
agreed, pointing out that imposing a greater burden on business
owners by the government is an abdication of its &quot;paramount&quot;
constitutional duty to &quot;protect person and property.&quot;

from the tax, which is distributed to counties.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">At issue is the extent to
which the state can exempt the taxation of stocks and bonds of
Georgia corporations while it continues to tax the stocks and
bonds of out-of-state corporations. The U.S. Supreme Court is

which legal analysts believe will succeed. SLF attorneys point
out that Georgia's tax is a more egregious violation of the Commerce
Clause of the U.S. Constitution than the North Carolina tax.

program in <I>C.K. v. Shalala</I>, a suit brought by welfare recipients
who are represented by Legal Services of New Jersey, the ACLU
of New Jersey, and the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund. Under
New Jersey's Aid to Families with Dependent Children system, a
single mother previously received an increase in her monthly cash
payment for each additional child born. New Jersey's reform program
eliminates the grant increase to mothers who have additional children
after joining the rolls. Seven AFDC recipients and their children
filed suit, alleging that the program violates the due process

regulations governing AFDC, family planning services, and research
on human subjects. The case is before the Third Circuit following

<h3>December/January 1996 <i>Insider</i></h3>: 

<h4><i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</i></h4>
</center>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/meyerson.htm">Adam Meyerson</a>, Vice President for Educational Affairs at The Heritage Foundation.<hr>
<p>
<I>Policy Review</I>, the magazine of The Heritage Foundation,
has a contemporary new look, a partial name change, and a historic
new mission: to restore the tradition of American citizenship
by repairing the institutions of civil society and returning to
the core political principles of our Founding Fathers.
<P>
Our new name is <a href="/heritage/p_review/jan96/toc75.html"><I>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</I></a>.
We'll be publishing six rather than four times a year. We will
focus on the institutions of civil society-families, communities,
voluntary associations, churches and other religious organizations,
business enterprises, public and private schools, local governments-that
are solving problems more effectively than large, centralized,
bureaucratic government.
<P>
We think of our mission as &quot;Applied Tocqueville,&quot; in
honor of Alexis de Tocqueville, the French aristocrat who in 1832
wrote <I>Democracy in America</I>, still the best book about our
country ever published. Tocqueville described an America that
was the most democratic, most egalitarian, most religious, most
prosperous, most charitable country on earth-with limited national
government and active citizen involvement in local government.
It was an America of strong families and entrepreneurial business
leadership, an America where voluntary associations of citizens
were better than politicians in addressing the problems of their
communities. <I>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</I>
will study the success stories of institutions and civic leaders
today who are carrying on this tradition.
<P>
We believe that the restoration of civil society is one of the
most important challenges and opportunities facing conservatism
over the next generation. Sixty years of liberalism have left
America's social fabric in tatters. The family, the building block
of a compassionate society, is collapsing. Crime is robbing America's
poor of hope and killing opportunity in vast sections of our cities.
Public education is preparing children neither for citizenship
in a free society nor for competition in a 21st-century economy.
<P>
Big Government is not the solution to these catastrophes. But
merely dismantling Big Government is not the answer, either. Conservatives
must rebuild families, voluntary associations, local governments,
and other institutions of civil society that will remedy the ills
left untreated by failed liberal programs. 
<P>
The return of political powers and responsibilities from Washington
to smaller units of government will not automatically bring this
about. Liberal ideas, interest groups, and bureaucratic structures
are even more entrenched in statehouses and city halls than in
the federal government. Nonprofit charities have been corrupted
by a heavy dependence on government money. Many leading charities
share the entitlement mentality of the welfare state and, as the
United Way and New Era scandals suggest, are often less accountable
than government.
<P>
Entirely new institutions will have to be created. Conservative
public policies can erase the welfare state's incentives for family
collapse, but they cannot put the family back together. Government
cannot build and sustain healthy marriages, nor teach children
to be hardworking, responsible, and virtuous. The family will
be restored not by public policy but by private, character-building
institutions that touch the souls of men and women and inspire
them to be more responsible husbands, wives, and parents. 
<P>
Lock-them-up policies in criminal justice are likewise necessary
but insufficient to address the catastrophe of crime. The root
cause of crime is spiritual, a hardening of the heart that makes
a man or woman indifferent to the rights of others. The most effective
institutions in criminal justice will therefore be those that
create moral communities and transform individual attitudes and
behaviors.
<P>
The second half of the 19th century and the early 20th century
saw the creation of the Red Cross, the Boy Scouts, YMCAs and YWCAs,
and countless other voluntary organizations that strengthened
character and addressed the failings of their communities. America
is about to enter another such age, with conservatives at the
lead. <I>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</I>
will be at the forefront of this movement, chronicling its success
stories and describing its challenges and opportunities.

<h3>In Focus: Book Review</h3>
<P></center>


<i>Goldwater: The Man Who Made a Revolution</i><br>
By Lee Edwards, Regnery Publishing 1995, 572 pp.<hr>

	Lee Edwards Goldwater: The Man Who Made a Revolution is an insightful and important look at the man who is more responsible than any other for the growth and success of the conservative movement in America. This biography is all the more timely, given the conservative congressional sweep of November 1994. It portrays a Goldwater who is every bit as fiesty as legend tells, and quite a bit more complex.<P>
	Edwards, who was a veteran of the 1964 Goldwater campaign, provides a thorough examination of Goldwaters life, starting with his childhood and his days at Staunton Military Academy. Special attention, of course, is paid to Goldwaters career in the U.S. Senate, his Presidential campaign of 1964 (and the Draft Goldwater effort that drew him into it), his role in the making and unmaking of presidents from 1968 through 1976, and his more recent  pronouncements on social issues. <P>
	While Goldwater delivers a wealth of information, three particularly important and interesting points stand out. First, the reader is reminded that some things are so old that they seem new. The negative campaigning that journalists often decry today was pioneered by Lyndon Johnsons reelection campaignwith the tacit approval of the major media. Indeed, in three decades of presidential elections since 1964, no campaign of any party has matched Johnsons for sheer dishonesty, demagoguery, and meanness.  Edwards methodically reminds the reader of the infamous Daisy Girl advertisement, as well as the less-well-remembered but still devastating Ice Cream Girl and Social Security ads. Johnsons whole Anti-Campaign, complete with political espionage and possible misuse of the FBI, not only set a sad precedent for CREEP but almost certainly exceeded it in scope and (needless to say) efficiency.<P> 
	Edwards also reminds us that the savage and unwarranted attacks on Goldwater in the fall of 1964 were made more plausible by the drubbing he received at the hands of fellow Republicans during the nomination contest. While Edwards concedes that no Republican could have defeated Johnson in 1964 (a fact Edwards maintains was well understood by Goldwater himself throughout the campaign), he makes a powerful argument that the attacks of liberal Republicans like Rockefeller, Romney, and Scranton, helped turn a mere defeat into a landslide.<P>
	Second, Edwards thoughtfully illuminates the complexity of Barry Goldwater. Edwards argues that, far from being a recent phenomenon, Goldwater has always been torn between a traditionalist side and a libertarian side, the side that today surprises conservatives with exclamations of pro-choice and pro-gay sentiment. This split could be seen even in Goldwaters earliest political involvement: one of his first political acts was to urge the city of Phoenix to reject the evils of dog racing, yet one of his first votes after being elected to the Phoenix city council was to approve a liquor license for a supermarket 1200 feet from West Phoenix High School over the objections of local parents and religious leaders.    <P>
	Edwards argues that this complexity has been often intertwined with another factor: to Barry Goldwater, a personal connection often meant more than philosophical consistency. His lack of a deeply personal connection to Ronald Reagan, for example, may largely explain Goldwaters often-cool relationship with his heir as leader of the conservative movement. His recent stand on social issues may have been influenced not only by his latent libertarianism but by his daughters abortions and the homosexuality of a grandson and grandniece. Barry Goldwater is an intensely human figure, and the human relationships of day to day life have almost certainly affected his politics to a greater degree than most conservatives have understood.  <P>
	Finally, and most importantly, Edwards succeeds in reminding his readers of the unpayable debt that conservatives owe to Barry Goldwater, regardless of the meanderings of his latter years. Edwards catalogues a fraction of the multitude of individuals who began their political lives inspired by Barry Goldwater and who went on to carry forward the conservative cause. He imagines, plausibly, all the good that would not have happened without a Senator Barry Goldwater and a campaign of 1964, and imagines equally plausibly all the good that might have happened had he won. <P>  
	As Edwards shows, sometimes Goldwater himself was unaware of the potential impact of his actions: he did not anticipate how his 1957 Senate speech criticizing the Eisenhower budget would catapult him to leadership of the conservative movement, nor did he anticipate that Conscience of a Conservative would have any appreciable effect on the nations politics. At other times, especially in 1964, Goldwater understood well that he carried on his shoulders the aspirations of millions of freedom-loving Americans. Always, however, he made a difference. As Edwards concludes, Goldwaters 1964 presidential campaign marked the true beginning of a tectonic shift in American politics from East to West, from the cities to the suburbs, from big government to limited government, from containment to liberation, from liberal to conservative that continues to shape the nation, as the historic elections of 1994 attest.<P>

<P>
<B>Selected Foreign and Defense Policy Issues for the '96 Presidential
Campaign</B>, by Thomas Henriksen
<br>
<I>Briefing</I>, Pacific Research Institute

<P>
President Clinton has not only failed to craft a coherent international
mission for the United States, but he has also failed to resolve
a host of independent conflicts, according to Thomas Henriksen,
Senior Fellow &amp; Associate Director at the Hoover Institution.
This study surveys several foreign policy issues facing America
as it enters the 1996 national election campaign, including: the
proliferation of mass-destruction weapons; counter-terrorism;
the role of the United States in the new international order;
human rights; continuing trouble spots (e.g. North Korea &amp;
Bosnia); and defense cutbacks and pentagon reorganization. 22

<B>The Rising Threat of Revolutionary Islam <BR>
in Algeria</B>, by James Phillips 
<br>
<I>Backgrounder</I> No. 1060, The Heritage Foundation

<P>
If the bloody civil war in Algeria is not halted, argues Heritage
Senior Policy Analyst James Phillips, the resulting political
chaos could destabilize the entire region. According to Phillips,
the only thing worse than the present situation would be victory
by Islamic radicals over the Algerian army. Such an outcome would
pose significant long-term threats to U.S. interests in North
Africa, the Middle East, and the Muslim world generally. Phillips
provides a history of Algeria's political breakdown and a view
of the current stalemate and grim future. He then points out how
a revolutionary Algeria would undermine U.S. interests and describes
a policy that he believes the Clinton administration should adopt.

<I>Heritage Lecture</I> No. 544, The Heritage Foundation

<P>
In a speech given at The Heritage Foundation, President &Aacute;rp&aacute;d
G&ouml;ncz asserted that Hungary must set off on the road to Euro-Atlantic
integration, including full-fledged membership in NATO and the
European Union. President G&ouml;ncz surveyed the history of his
country since the end of the Cold War, and concluded that Hungary's
speedy integration into a Euro-Atlantic alliance should continue
despite criticism that the change is occurring too fast.  The
President also stated that it is his country's responsibility
to avoid delays and &quot;to drop anchor as soon as possible,
and for good, in the safety of the developed democracies' haven.&quot;

<B>Holbrooke Horror: The U.S. Plan for Bosnia,  <BR>
</B>by Ted Galen Carpenter 
<br>
<I>Foreign Policy Briefing</I> No. 37, Cato Institute

<P>
Cato Institute's Director of Foreign Policy Studies, Ted Galen
Carpenter, contends that the Clinton administration foolishly
insists on maintaining the fiction of a united Bosnian state while
accepting a de facto ethnic partition.  Carpenter declares that
the inherent contradiction between those two objectives will doom
the peace agreement and pose a grave danger to the proposed U.S.-led
NATO peacekeeping force.  The author then lists specific problems
with <BR>
the peace plan and describes the multiple sources of danger  a
U.S.-led peacekeeping force will face. The paper concludes with
a recommended alternate plan of action advocating that the belligerents
themselves reach a durable agreement reflecting battlefield realities
and the balance of political and military forces.  Carpenter writes
that under no circumstances should the United States send troops
to enforce an inherently unworkable peace accord. 15 pp. CONTACT:

<B>How to Close Down the Department of Energy,</B> <BR>
by John Barry
<br>
<I>Backgrounder </I>No. 1061, The Heritage Foundation

<P>
Heritage Foundation Research Assistant John Barry calls for shutting
down the Department of Energy (DOE) and outlines the Heritage
proposal to do so. Among the provisions of the plans are: selling
off DOE assets such as the Strategic and Naval Petroleum Reserves;
terminating unnecessary DOE programs, privatizing government owned
laboratories, and transferring all defense-related nuclear weapons
functions to a new agency within the Department of Defense. According
to Barry, closing down DOE and making the related reforms would
save American taxpayers more than $41 billion over the next five
years, including $16 billion in asset sales. 21 pp.  CONTACT:

<B>The Telecom Revolution: American Opportunity</B> 
<br>
The Progress and Freedom Foundation 

<P>
The United States should replace and modernize its existing telecommunications
regulatory policies, argue the authors of this comprehensive study.
The study notes that the telecommunications industry already constitutes
one-seventh of our economy and, by the early 21st century, the
global information industry is expected to be a $3 trillion market.
Furthermore, in 1995, one-half of all capital investment in America,
broadly defined, will be in computers and telecommunications equipment.
Despite these facts, the telecommunications industry must comply
with a  statutory and regulatory system erected in the 1930's.
The study outlines recommendations that, according to the authors,
would provide for a modern and effective government to complement
market forces, speeding the development of new products and services
for Americans. 111 pp.  CONTACT: The Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation,

<B>The Human Cost of Regulation: the Case of Medical Devices and
the FDA, </B>by David Murray
<br>
<I>Hudson Briefing Paper </I>No. 183, The Hudson Institute

<P>
The Food and Drug Administration's current system for approving
medical devices has been marred by regulatory snags that unnecessarily
delay the introduction of lifesaving and life-enhancing products
to the market, according to Hudson Research Analyst David Murray.
Meanwhile, the European Community's medical device approval system
allows new products that are no less safe than in the United States
to reach the market far more quickly. The author suggests that
the U. S. should adopt a system similar to that used by the European
Community for medical device approvals. Such a system would terminate
FDA's monopoly on the premarket approval of medical devices and
establish a mainly privatized process, based on a quality systems
approach to evaluation. 24 pp.  CONTACT: Hudson Institute, Herman

<B>Regulatory Reform in the Electric <BR>
Power Industry,</B> by Vernon Smith
<br>
<I>Issues Analysis </I>No. 3, The Barry Goldwater Institute.

<P>
According to University of Arizona Professor Vernon L. Smith,
the public is finally challenging the notion that certain industries,
most specifically the electric power industry, are &quot;natural
monopolies.&quot; Smith looks at how various countries are seeking
to deregulate their electric power industries, and shows that
countries that only a few years ago were using a central planning
approach are now surpassing the United States in establishing
competitive electric power industries. The report concludes that
policy makers should begin thinking seriously about reforming
our approach to the electric power industry. 20 pp.  CONTACT:

<B>Dangerous Excesses: A Look at the Food <BR>
and Drug Administration, </B>by Jeffrey J. Pierce
<br>
<I>Issues Analysis </I>No. 13, Citizens for a Sound <BR>
Economy Foundation

<P>
Jeffrey Pierce, Regulatory Analyst at Citizens for a Sound Economy
Foundation, shows that the Food and Drug Administration-originally
designed to protect the health of U.S. consumers-has increasingly
become an obstacle to providing consumers with potentially life-saving
drugs and medical devices. Pierce notes that delays in approvals
by the agency are ballooning, as the new drug approval process
now takes some 13-15 years. At the same time, the agency has been
growing, with a budget nearing the billion dollar mark. Peirce
illustrates how FDA has dramatically enlarged its authority, and
cites several instances where it has dramatically delayed the
development of new medical devices and medicines. The paper also
shows that FDA has been expanding its limits on the speech of
pharmaceutical companies and food manufacturers. Pierce, concludes
with a comprehensive set of recommendations for improving FDA,
including: prioritizing functions, allowing private organizations
and laboratories to issue medical device approvals; and contracting
out testing to the private sector. 14 pp.  CONTACT: Citizens for

<B>The FDA vs. Recycling: Has Food Packaging Law Gone Too Far?</B>
<B>Part 1,</B> by Alexander Volokh
<br>
<I>Policy Study</I> No. 196, Reason Foundation

<P>
According Alexander Volokh, Assistant Policy Analyst at the Reason
Foundation, food packaging regulations enforced by the Food and
Drug Administration aimed at preventing contaminants from entering
our food may discourage the use of recycled materials. Volokh
writes that FDA operates under the assumption that all substances
diffuse over time, that everything that makes up your Coca-Cola
bottle will <I>eventually</I> become part of your Coke, and vice
versa. Therefore, FDA regulates the components of food packaging
as <I>indirect</I> food additives. Because FDA scrutinizes recycled
materials so closely, it usually takes a half a year or more and
costs hundreds of thousands of dollars to gain FDA approval for
recycled packaging material. Volokh suggests that deregulation
of the approval process would be a way to expand recycling markets.

Part 2 of &quot;The FDA vs. Recycling&quot; shows that federal
hazardous waste regulations, such as the Resource Conservation
Recovery Act (RCRA) and Superfund, have burdened the hazardous
waste recycling industry, damaging the economic viability of recycled
products like lead batteries and used oil. For example, a company
that wants to get a permit to send their industrial waste, such
as car batteries or scrap metal, to be recycled faces a huge liability.
Under Superfund-which regulates the cleanup of toxic waste sites-if
a recycling facility is declared hazardous, whoever arranged for
the treatment or disposal of a hazardous substance can be liable
for the cleanup of the entire site. The paper concludes that if
products are heavily regulated after they are thrown out or in
the process of recycling, it should not be a surprise that people
will prefer to use virgin materials rather than recycle. 24 pp.

<B>What a Balanced Federal Budget with Tax Cuts Would Mean to
the Economy,</B> by William Beach and John Barry
<br>
<I>F.Y.I. </I>No. 69, The Heritage Foundation

<P>
Congress's balanced budget plan with tax cuts will lead, over
the next seven years, to greater business investment, higher earnings
per hour, and faster economic growth than under current law, according
to William Beach, Heritage Visiting Fellow in Tax Analysis, and
John Barry, Heritage Research Assistant. Beach and Barry conducted
an interim analysis of Congress's balanced budget plan with tax
cuts using the econometric model developed by Laurence H. Meyer
&amp; Associates, the same model used by the Clinton administration's
OMB and the Federal Reserve Board. Rather than cause an economic
downturn as some critics of the plan believe, the Heritage analysis
predicts that the following economic boons to American families
and businesses would result over the next seven years: an additional
$32.1 billion in real disposable income; an additional $66.2 billion
in consumption expenditures; an additional $88.2 billion in real
non-residential fixed investment; and an additional 103,700 housing
starts. 8 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation,

<B>Direct Student Loans: Putting Taxpayers at Risk,</B> by Michael
Cannon
<br>
<I>Issues and Answers</I> No. 14, Citizens for a <BR>
Sound Economy
<P>
Through the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP), the
federal government insures against defaulted loans made to students
by private lending institutions. According to Michael Cannon,
Citizens for a Sound Economy Policy Analyst, this program has
proven costly, forcing taxpayers to foot the bill for billions
of dollars in defaulted loans. The administration's response to
the problem has been to offer all loans directly to students-bypassing
traditional lending institutions. Cannon contends that government
control of student loans will not only cause default rates to
skyrocket but will also place all the risk on the shoulders of
taxpayers. The author suggests that the federal government limit
taxation and government spending so that students will have more
money to put toward college tuition and more private sector jobs
waiting for them upon graduation. Cannon concludes that Congress
must reject any plan to nationalize the student loan industry
if they are serious about protecting taxpayers from wasteful government
spending. 5 pp.  CONTACT: Citizens for a Sound Economy, 1250 H

<B>Public vs. Private: Stadium Financing, <BR>
Operation and Development,</B> by Grant Gulibon
<br>
Allegheny Institute

<P>
According to Grant Gulibon, Allegheny Institute Research Assistant,
the power that professional sports teams are able to wield over
their local governments comes from overrated economic and psychological
value to the given municipalities. Gulibon demonstrates that professional
sports' economic contribution to local communities is exaggerated
and that only privately financed and owned stadiums remain a profitable
investment. His study also shows that government owned and operated
stadiums are rarely run efficiently and remain a taxpayer burden.
This theory is applied to Pittsburgh's current stadium situation
and threats by team owners to leave town if a new stadium is not
built. Gulibon concludes that if a new stadium is built it should
be a private venture and not be financed by public money or owned
by the local government. 20 pp.  CONTACT: Allegheny Institute

<I>Contemporary Issues Series</I> No. 75, Center for the Study
of American Business

<P>
In this essay, University of Georgia Economics Professor Dwight
Lee asks what the prospects of halting and then reversing federal
spending are. Lee points out that the problem of an excessive
and increasingly out-of-touch federal government is explained
by two interconnected problems. First, since the 1930's, political
power has become increasingly centralized in Washington, with
the federal government taking over more and more functions that
were not traditionally government responsibilities at any level.
Second, the federal tax system takes a large percentage of the
taxes paid by Americans. Lee writes that the type of reform necessary
to control the tax and spend power of the federal government cannot
be realized by congressional legislative fiat. This is serious
reform, according to the author, the type that has to be imposed
on reluctant politicians.  Lee calls for tax reform that is backed
by a constitutional amendment. 16 pp.  CONTACT: Center for the

<B>The Allegheny Regional Asset District Tax,</B> <BR>
by Jake Haulk
<br>
Allegheny Institute

<P>
This report analyzes the Allegheny Regional Asset District (RAD)
and the local option sales tax which funds it. RAD is a program
similiar to programs in large American cities that uses dedicated
tax revenue to subsidize cultural and recreational organizations,
usually stadiums for professional sports franchises. The report
details specific damage that the RAD tax has caused. Included
is evidence that the added sales tax will cause a shift of some
sales and jobs out of one county and into neighboring counties.
Furthermore, according to Allegheny Institute's Jake Haulk, a
supposed tax reform component of the RAD program is largely a
redistribution from better off suburbs to poorer municipalities.
By lumping this redistribution effort with the RAD program, the
opportunity for real tax reform as well as tax and expenditure
reductions by local governments has been largely foreclosed. 18

<P>
<B>Why Congress Must Reform Welfare, <BR>
</B>by Robert Rector
<br>
<I>Backgrounder </I>No. 1063, The Heritage Foundation

<P>
Robert Rector, Senior Policy Analyst at The Heritage Foundation,
discusses why Congress must reform welfare. Rector begins by addressing
the claim often times presented to the public that the current
welfare system does not promote long-term dependence. Rector's
research shows that: 1) the 4.7 million families currently receiving
AFDC have already spent, on average, six-and-a-half years on welfare;
2) when past and estimated future receipt of AFDC are combined,
the estimated average length of stay on AFDC, among those families
currently receiving benefits, is 13 years; and 3) among the 4.7
million families currently receiving AFDC, over 90 percent will
spend more than two years on the AFDC caseload. Next, Rector shares
the results of recent research by Congressional Budget Office
Director June O'Neill, which shows that increasing the length
of time a child spends on welfare may reduce the child's IQ by
as much as 20 percent. Rector writes that the more welfare income
received by a boy's family during his childhood, the lower the
boy's earnings as an adult, even when compared to boys in families
with identical non-welfare income. Furthermore, Rector demonstrates
how receipt of welfare and living in a single-parent family during
childhood are strongly associated with criminal activity among
young men and having illegitimate children among young women.
Rector concludes by outlining the basic themes of the House/Senate
conference proposals to reform welfare. 12 pp. CONTACT: Chris

<B>Reforming Medicare: Comparing the House <BR>

<br>
<I>Issue Bulletin </I>No. 220, The Heritage Foundation

<P>
Heritage Policy Analyst John Liu illustrates why Medicare needs
serious reform if taxpayers are to be spared future tax increases
or deep cuts in Medicare benefits for the elderly. Liu believes
the current reforms being proposed in Congress are only stop-gap
measures to ward off fiscal disaster when the &quot;Baby-Boom&quot;
generation qualifies for Medicare. This paper compares the components
of the House and Senate Medicare reform proposals and identifies
the best policy in each area. For example, while both bills establish
consumer choice in health plans, Lui believes that they should
also expand the options available to senior citizens. Liu also
describes how certain provisions within the current proposals
could have harmful consequences for the healthcare market and
the elderly if they are not modified and recommends provisions
that he thinks should be included in a final bill. 20 pp. CONTACT:

<B>Charting Florida's Educational Future, <BR>
</B>by Jonathan Hage
<br>
<I>Outside the Lines</I> No. 3, Foundation for Florida's Future


<P>
Director of Research for Foundation for Florida's Future, Jonathan
Hage, supports charter schools as a way to solve the problems
facing Florida public education. Charter schools are independent
public schools formed under a &quot;charter,&quot; or contract,
made between <I>organizers</I> (e.g., teachers, parents, colleges,
local organizations, or others) and <I>sponsors</I> (e.g., local
school boards, state boards of education or some other legislatively
approved and publicly accountable body). Hage provides examples
of successful charter schools in other states and addresses several
concerns that communities might have about them. Among the concerns
Hage addresses are: &quot;Charter schools won't be regulated and
children will be hurt&quot;; &quot;Charter schools are just another
passing fad&quot;; &quot;Charter schools will take money from
traditional public schools&quot;; &quot;Charter schools will open
the door to religious involvement&quot;; and &quot;Charter schools
will serve the 'elite' students, not the poor at-risk.&quot; Based
on his research, Hage concludes that charter schools will empower
parents to have more control over their children's education and
that schools will be held more accountable for their performance.

<B>How Much More do We Have to Spend to Achieve a Totally Illiterate
Society?</B> <BR>
by Dwight Williams 
<br>
<I>Independence Issue Paper</I> No. 9, Independence Institute


<P>
Dwight Williams, Research Associate at The Independence Institute,
sheds light on the perplexing question: &quot;Why has academic
achievement declined or stagnated in Colorado and the rest of
the United States despite the tremendous increase in education
spending in recent decades?&quot; Williams shows that there is
no correlation between more school spending and higher achievement.
For example, total spending on education in Colorado grew 1730
percent from 1964 to 1994, despite this, over the same period
of time, Colorado student's national test scores remained static.
Also, because so much school revenue is spent on social conditioning
and other non-academic pursuits, only 41 percent of school days
are devoted to core academic work. Williams details steps which
public schools could take to reduce overhead, improve efficiency,
and free up resources for actual teaching-without increasing the
burden on taxpayers. 12 pp.  CONTACT: Independence Institute,

<B>Making Schools Work: Spending and Student Achievement, </B>by
Eric Hanushek
<br>
<I>Policy Study</I> No. 68, The Heartland Institute

<P>
Eric Hanushek, Professor of Economics and Public Policy at the
University of Rochester, found that real spending on public education
in the U.S. is rising rapidly.  Despite this, student-teacher
and student-staff ratios have fallen, and student achievement
is either flat or falling. According to the study, three problems
largely explain the inefficiency of public education today: 1)
disregard for efficiency and productivity; 2) absence of performance
incentives; and 3) public schools don't learn from experience.
Hanushek concludes that only when public educators focus on making
efficiency and productivity a priority among educators and administrators
will student achievement improve. 28 pp.  CONTACT: The Heartland

<B>Natural Resource Damages: A Legal, Economic, and Policy Analysis,</B>
edited by Richard B. Stewart

National Legal Center for the Public Interest

<P>
This book addresses the emerging area of environmental law known
as &quot;natural resource damages&quot;(NRD), in a series of legal
and economic essays. Natural resource damages is a form of environmental
liability established by Superfund, the Oil Pollution Act, and
other federal and state statutes. These laws provide that public
(principally governmental) &quot;trustees&quot; can sue those
entities (principally private) held liable for damages to natural
resources.  As the monograph's Editor, Richard B. Stewart, former
head of the U.S. Department of Justice's Environment and Natural
Resources Division, points out that natural resource damages law
is an awakening &quot;sleeping giant.&quot; He writes that it
will become increasingly important for American businesses to
become aware of NRD's implications. According to Stewart, NRD
threatens U.S. business with potentially enormous liabilities
and massive transaction costs. This book attempts to identify
serious flaws in the existing system and suggests alternative
approaches that would protect natural resources without placing
an enormous liability upon U.S. businesses. 208 pp.  CONTACT:

<P>
Land trusts were originally a perfect vehicle for privatized environmental
protection, according to retired civil and environmental engineer
Carol LaGrasse. Today, however, colossal environmental land brokerage
organizations are a channel for innocent, environmentally minded
citizen donors to unknowingly pool their resources with the taxing
power of state and federal governments to wrest land from private
ownership. LaGrasse writes that land trusts are exempt from the
possible subjection to demands by citizens for information under
the Freedom of Information laws. So, these groups can, in effect,
perform government functions without public scrutiny or responsibility.
LaGrasse points out that non-profit land trusts are serving primarily
as real estate brokers for government and asks the question: &quot;why
should local citizens, economically restricted by land preservation,
grant a tax exemption to land trusts to absorb a tax shift caused
by their wholesale land acquisitions, contrary to the community
interests?&quot; 16 pp.  CONTACT: The Property Rights Foundation

<B>How Washington Subverts Your Local Sheriff: The Bipartisan
Assault on Local Law Enforcement, </B>by Edwin Meese, III &amp;
Rhett DeHart
<br>
<I>Policy Review </I>No. 75, The Heritage Foundation

<P>
Edwin Meese, III, former Attorney General under President Reagan,
and Rhett DeHart, Special Counsel to Mr. Meese, show how Congress's
massive federalization of crimes has served to undermine local
law enforcement. According to the authors, the case against federalization
of crime includes the following: nationalizing crime contradicts
constitutional principles; violates double jeopardy; incurs unnecessary
expense; undermines state experimentation; and shifts accountability.
The proper role of the federal government, according to Meese
and DeHart, can best be described by the word &quot;limited.&quot;
There are only two broad areas of criminal jurisdiction where
the federal government should be involved. The first, crime against
the sovereignty of the United States, is concerned with clearly
federal issues such as treason, counterfeiting, and national security
violations. The second area of federal criminal jurisdiction is
limited to narrowly defined, significant interstate, or international,
crime. Furthermore, the federal government is best suite to provide
local officials with technological assistance and a database of
crime statistics as well as criminal histories and fingerprints.
Although both authors recognize that crime is a problem that affects
the entire nation, they write that &quot;both constitutional tradition
and practical experience demonstrate that it is most effectively
fought at the state and local level.&quot; CONTACT: Brendan O'Scannlain,

<B>No More Parole: The Case for Truth-in-Sentencing in Tennessee,</B>
by James Wootton
<br>
<I>Andrew Jackson Institute Policy Report</I> No. 104, Andrew
Jackson Institute

<P>
James Wootton, President of the Safe Streets Alliance, presents
a case for the policy known as &quot;Truth in Sentencing.&quot;
This policy seeks to fix the critical problem of early release
of violent offenders. Truth-in-Sentencing would abolish parole
and other early release programs for violent criminals and would
keep them incarcerated for at least 85 percent of their sentences.
Such an approach, similar to that in place in the federal prison
system, would greatly strengthen Tennessee's criminal justice
system by ending the current practice of allowing the majority
of violent offenders sentenced to prison to serve only a fraction
of their sentence, writes Wootton. The study illustrates that
the direct costs of allowing a violent criminal to remain on the
streets far outweigh the costs of keeping an offender in prison.

<I>Wisconsin Policy Research Institute Report</I> Vol. 8, No.
6, Wisconsin Policy Research Institute

<P>
This paper evaluates the prison expansion program which has been
underway in Wisconsin since the late 1970's. Among its findings:
1) increased incarceration is a major reason for an 18% cut in
Wisconsin's crime rate between 1980 and the end of 1994; 2) while
prison costs are a growing share of the state's budget, on a per
capita basis they were a modest $46 a year in 1994; and 3) more
unskilled youths, a continuing increase in unstable, single parent
families, and an apparent departure from the state's successful
prison expansion policy, all portend an increase in crime in Wisconsin.
The study concludes that Wisconsin's prison policy has been effective
and that it warrants review as the state decides whether additional
prison space should remain a priority. 32 pp.  CONTACT: Wisconsin

<B>Three Years of the Americans With Disabilities Act: Lessons
for Employers, </B>by Mark Parenti
<br>
National Legal Center for the Public Interest

<P>
The broad and far-reaching language of the Americans with Disabilities
Act (ADA) left many employers uncertain and confused about its
requirements when it was first enacted five years ago, according
to former NLCPI staff member Mark Parenti. In order to determine
where the law has become more settled and clear, and where it
still presents employers with uncertainty, the first part of this
paper examines how the courts and the executive branch have applied
and enforced the ADA. The second part of the study addresses the
overlap and conflict between ADA provisions and other federal
laws governing the workplace. The paper concludes that the courts
are doing the job of staking out limits to the Act's uncertain
requirements and defining its vague language-a job that Congress
and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission neglected. 67

<br>
<I>Research Memorandum</I> No. 10, Manhattan Institute

<P>
The class action format can serve objectives of practicality and
fairness, yet at the same time it is recognized that the device
poses dangers, including dangers to members of the plaintiff class
themselves, according to Lester Brickman,  Professor of Law at
Cardozo Law School. Brickman sheds light on the landmark decision,
<I>Matter of Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, Inc.</I>, that could mean the
end of abuse in class-action claims. &quot;Even if the usefulness
of the class action device in some cases is conceded,&quot; says
Brickman, &quot;it is entirely proper to regulate its use to curb...its
rich potential for 'blackmail' settlements.&quot; The settlement
in <I>Rhone-Poulenc Rorer</I>, according to Brickman, will be
an essential founding document in the coming fight to restore
such constraints on a sector of the litigation system that has

<I>The World &amp; I</I>, October 1995

<P>
David Forte, Professor at Cleveland State University, reflects
upon the past year in the Supreme Court, most notably, the emergence
of Justice Clarence Thomas as an intellectual dynamo of the conservative
bloc. Specifically, Forte describes the following significant
developments during the 1994-95 term: 1) the constitutional rules
affecting race, free speech, religious expression, congressional
powers, and federalism were tilted sharply to the right; 2) Justice
Thomas's intellectual emergence was rooted in the thought of the
framers; 3) the four-justice liberal bloc looked wistfully to
the judicial activism that characterized the Court from 1937 on;
and 4) only 82 opinions were written last term, fewer than in
any year since 1956, but, comments Forte, they were among the
best-crafted in decades. 6 pp. CONTACT: <I>The World &amp; I</I>,

This report attempts to debunk the myths of gun control, offering
an overview of several pivotal issues in the gun control debate.
Several researchers reveal their findings that there is little
or no connection between gun control and crime and help explain
why the record on gun control is so poor. The paper concludes
that firearms are not the root of the problem of violence and
arguably are almost completely divorced from it. &quot;As long
as some people have little or nothing to lose by spending their
lives in crime, dispositions to violence will persist-and increasingly
strict gun controls will do little if anything to improve matters.&quot;

scholars and colleagues discuss and debate the issue, Summit participants
developed a list of four approaches to be explored to help restore
balance between the states and the federal government: 1) a federalism
act to enhance the political safeguards of federalism and give
states more voice in congressional deliberations; 2) a mechanism
to provide the people of the states, through their legislatures,
the power to require the Congress to reconsider laws, specific
provisions of laws, or regulations that interfere with state authority;
3) a mechanism for the states to propose specific amendments to
the U.S. Constitution subject to ratification by the U.S. Congress;

<B>Robert Wood Johnson Foundation: One Philanthropy's Web of State

<br>
<I>Organization Trends</I>, August 1995

<P>
State health reform proposals were especially prominent during
the 1992 election campaign and again in 1993. The effect of those
high profile proposals created an impression in the media and
among the public that rhetoric concerning a &quot;crisis&quot;
in health care had an objective, verifiable reality. However,
Genevieve Young, a Washington, D.C. attorney, demonstrates that
this &quot;crisis&quot; was the creation of a well-funded, highly
organized campaign by special interests bent on imposing their
vision of health care on the rest of us. Chief among these special
interests was the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. Young sheds
light on the Foundation's activities, particularly its efforts
at the state level. She exposes a complex web of relationships
between the Foundation and various government entities, working
groups, commissions, and contractors-all designed to further the
cause of government-run health care.<I> </I>6 pp. CONTACT: Capital

<B>Justice Department's Efforts at Social Engineering Defeated</B>

ALF represented New Jersey firefighter candidates who had taken
a 1995 physical performance test to determine which candidates
were eligible to be hired as firefighters and in what order. The
Justice Department, however, did not like the results of the test
because not enough minority candidates did well and instructed
Newark to ignore the 1995 list and continue to hire from a list
generated by a 1992 exam.
<P>
The United States District Court of New Jersey agreed with ALF's
position and pointed out to the Justice Department that a test
had been devised several years earlier based on the best technical
advice and that that test had been approved by the United States,
the State of New Jersey and 12 cities of New Jersey which were
subject to an earlier consent decree concerning &quot;goals&quot;
for hiring firefighters. He further pointed out that when the
test had been given in 1992, the Justice Department had not objected
to the results. The <I>same</I> test was given in 1995, but because
the Justice Department did not like the results, it objected even
though the test was the one that it helped set up and approve.
The judge ordered that the State of New Jersey certify the 1995
list for hiring and scrap the 1992 list.

<B>DEFENDERS OF PROPERTY RIGHTS</B>

<P>
<B>Defenders Bring Suit Against City of Pacific Grove and State
of California for Violating Constitution  </B>
<P>
Defenders of Property Rights has filed suit in United States District
Court on behalf of Pacific Grove property owner Stephen J.L. Page.
The complaint alleges, among other things, that the City of Pacific
Grove, certain city officials, and the California Coastal Commission
denied him the approvals to build a home on residential property
in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S.
Constitution
<P>
These constitutional violations stem from Mr. Page's 1989 decision
to purchase a 1.08-acre parcel of oceanfront property in a subdivided,
fully developed residential area of Pacific Grove.  He was forced
to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars and countless hours
attending duplicative hearings and responding to unnecessary conditions
imposed upon his attempt to use his land.  Yet-six years later
-he still lacks the necessary government approvals to build his
home.  
<P>
Pacific Grove's desire to keep the land as &quot;open space&quot;
was evident when Mr. Page first intended to purchase the land,
and voluntarily agreed to delay his purchase for an entire year
in order to allow the city time to collect money to buy the lot
itself.  Having failed to raise the requisite funds to legitimately
acquire the land, the city deliberately schemed to maintain the
land as open space without paying for it by refusing to grant
a building permit.
<P>
Chief among the tactics employed by both the city and the Coastal
Commission was the imposition of multiple, onerous, and costly
conditions that must be met to obtain a permit.  For example,
Mr. Page must set aside eighty-five percent of his land as &quot;open
space&quot; (while paying taxes on 100% of the land).  Even if
he is allowed to build a home, he will not be able to: erect any
fencing on his land, including fencing to exclude trespassers;
erect any exterior light or even a flagpole without prior government
approval; repair his septic system; or remove any hazardous substance
or diseased plants from his yard.

<B>Defenders in Face Off with FAA over Proposed Taking in Farmland</B>
<P>
Defenders helped win a victory in a recent dispute involving the
Federal Aviation Administration in New Bloomfield, Missouri. The
FAA, in attempting to purchase air rights for a new radar tower,
was taking more than the air space: property owners were told
that their continued use of the underlying property could interfere
with the radar's well, although the FAA was not going to compensate
them for the loss of those rights.
<P>
After intense media scrutiny and public opposition, the FAA decided
that it did not need to purchase the air rights after all, and
have assured the property owners that the present and intended
future use of their farmland will not be restricted due to the
radar.
<P>
<B>Defenders Obtains Day in Court for <BR>
Property Owner</B>
<P>
In <I>Sudarsky v. City of New York,</I> Defenders argued that
the City of New York unconstitutionally took Peter Sudarsky's
property through zoning regulation, and urged the court to hear
the merits of the case. In 1986, Mr. Sudarsky attempted to develop
a seventeen-story building on prime commercial real estate in
Manhattan. The City of New York held up the development under
the guise of needing an easement to expand the subway, and in
the meantime downzoned the property, foiling Mr. Sudarsky's development
plans.
<P>
After several years and several courts, including a petition to
the United States Supreme Court (which was denied), the case still
has not gone to trial. Nevertheless, the New York Supreme Court
has just reversed a grant of summary judgment for defendants and
reinstated the claim. Mr. Sudarsky will finally get his day in
court and a chance to prove his takings claim.

<B>Consent Decree Allows Teen Challenge to Continue Faith-based

<P>
Through a negotiated settlement engineered by the Institute for
Justice, the Texas Commission on Alcohol and Drug Abuse (TCADA)
removed licensing requirements from Teen Challenge in San Antonio;
allowing the nationally acclaimed program to continue its healing
work on behalf of those addicted to drugs and alcohol. The consent
decree expressly recognizes Teen Challenge's right to continue
its current method of operation without a license or other state
imposed requirements that would interfere with Teen Challenge
ministry. Teen Challenge, which has an outstanding track record
in assisting addiction through a Christian faith-based program
was forced by the State of Texas to comply with secular credentialling
and training requirements which treat addiction as a disease that
can never be fully cured and that requires extensive psychological
counseling and therapeutic treatment.

plaintiffs argue that the program violates the first amendment
and a variety of state constitutional provisions.

to intervene in the lawsuit, and has coordinated <I>amicus</I>

<B>Landmark Wins Key Education <BR>
Reform Victory</B>
<P>
In another victory for education reform, the Pennsylvania Supreme
Court has ruled in favor of Landmark's client, the Wilkinsburg
School District, and has allowed the continued private management
of the district's Turner Elementary School.
<P>
The school district is undertaking a remarkable effort to restructure
the education program at one small elementary school. Against
the backdrop of one of the most dismal educational achievement
records imaginable, the school board is allowing a private firm
to manage and operate the school.

Despite repeated attempts by the National Education Association
to prevent it, Turner Elementary School opened under private management
on September 5, 1995 pending review by the Pennsylvania Supreme
Court. This is believed to be the first time in the nation that
a public school has been totally privatized.
<P>
The state supreme court upheld the district's effort by dissolving
a preliminary injunction, dismissing contempt charges against
school board members and ordering the trial court to hold another
hearing on the union's pending motion for a permanent injunction.
However, in its remand to the trial court, the supreme court took
the unusual step of addressing certain constitutional issues prior
to the hearing. Agreeing with the position advanced by Landmark,
the majority stated that &quot;even if the School Code were to
be interpreted to prohibit subcontracting of teachers...there
may be other conditions, which the school district insists there
are, which would render this application of the Public School
Code unconstitutional.&quot;

<B>Court's Price of Admission too High</B>
<P>
In a petition for <I>writ of certiori </I>filed recently, MSLF
requested that the Supreme Court hear <I>Laguna Gatuna, Inc. v.
Carol M. Browner, et al., </I>a case in which a New Mexico man
has been driven out of business by a cease and desist order issued
by EPA following its determination that the man's land is &quot;waters
of the United States&quot; under the Clean Water Act.
<P>
For years, Larry Squires used his land to dispose of waters produced
by southeastern New Mexico's important oil and gas industry. Although
EPA had told Squires previously that his lands were not &quot;waters
of the United States,&quot; in 1991 it changed its mind. In 1992,
EPA served Squires with a cease and desist order preventing him
from using his land. When his company was driven out of business,
Squires asked MSLF to represent him in suing EPA.
<P>
Squires contended that EPA's decision that his land fell under
the Clean Water Act was illegal. EPA asserted that Squires could
not sue until he violated the cease and desist order. If Squires
violated the EPA order, he would face penalties of $25,000 and
three years in prison, administrative fines of up to $125,000,
and a &quot;knowing&quot; penalty of $50,000 per day, plus three
years in prison.
<P>
A federal district court agreed with EPA. An appeal to the Tenth
Circuit Court of Appeals yielded the following decision in June:
&quot;Laguna's policy argument that it should not be necessary
to violate an EPA order and risk civil and criminal penalties
to obtain judicial review is well taken. Nevertheless...we reject
Laguna's conclusion such a situation is constitutionally intolerable.&quot;
<P>
In asking the Supreme Court to hear Laguna's case, MSLF asserts
that the Tenth Circuit's decision conflicts with the Constitution's
Fifth Amendment requirement that &quot;[n]o person shall...be
deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of
law,&quot; as well as numerous Supreme Court decisions that &quot;individuals
must receive notice and an opportunity to be heard before the
Government deprives them of property.&quot;

<B>OREGONIANS IN ACTION</B>

<P>
<B>City of Tigard Rebuffs U.S. Supreme Court </B>
<P>
On August 29th, the Tigard City Council voted to reinstate the
same bikepath/greenway conditions on the Dolan's A-Boy plumbing
store building permit that the United States Supreme Court struck
down in the highly publicized landmark property rights case, <I>Dolan
v. City of Tigard</I>.
<P>
In June last year, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the city had
failed to prove &quot;rough proportionality&quot; between the
impact of an expanded plumbing store building and the city's requirement
that the Dolans give up 10% of their land for a public bikepath
and greenway along Fanno Creek. Although the U.S. Supreme Court
was skeptical that Tigard could meet the proportionality test,
it remanded the case back to the city to give it an opportunity
to do so. During the months of inaction on the part of the city,
it did not withdraw the unconstitutional conditions, revise them,
or try to justify them. The Dolans then filed a legal action in
circuit court for damages caused by the city's unconstitutional
actions.
<P>
The city eventually instituted proceedings in which they attempted
to establish the required connection between impact of the building
and the bikepath/greenway conditions.
<P>
The Dolans have tried to settle with the city by agreeing to conditions
that would accommodate the city's bikepath and greenway needs
as well as the building. In fact, the city's staff proposed virtually
the same compromise, but later the city decided to reimpose essentially
what it had imposed four years before.

<B>Texas Immigration Suit Supported on Appeal</B>
<P>
Joined by Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison and Representative Jack
Fields, WLF filed a brief in the Fifth Circuit in support of Texas'
position in <I>Texas v. U.S.</I>, the lawsuit brought to compel
the federal government to enforce immigration laws adequately
or to compensate Texas for the fiscal burdens resulting from inadequate
enforcement. WLF argued in its brief that if the federal government
fails to control illegal immigration adequately, the result is
a massive unfunded mandate imposed upon the states to provide
for the immigrants' education-a mandate that the federal government
cannot impose without compensatory funding.  
<P>
<B>Anti-Gang Injunction Supported in California Supreme Court</B>
<P>
WLF filed a brief in the California Supreme Court in support of
the City of San Jose's position in <I>People v. Carlos Acuna</I>,
a suit over the constitutionality of an injunction to stop gang
activity by the defendants.  The defendants were found to have
been part of two street gangs, the &quot;Varrio Surreno Treces&quot;
(VST) and &quot;Varrio Surreno Locos&quot; (VSL), that maintained
a reign of terror in the community of Rocksprings, a neighborhood
in San Jose. The City obtained an injunction to abate these activities
as a public nuisance. The state appellate court, however, struck
down many provisions of the injunction as a violation of the gang
members' First Amendment rights, WLF argued that the First Amendment
did not forbid an injunction to limit the congregating of known
gang members.

 <li><a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi69.html">Balanced Budget Talking Points #1</a>: <b>What a Balanced Federal Budget with Tax Cuts Would Mean to the Economy,</b> by William Beach and John Barry. <BR>

<P>
See Taxation &amp; Budget page 6, 8 pp. (<I>F.Y.I. </I>#69)<BR>

<P>
<li><a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi76.html">Balanced Budget Talking Points #2</a>: <b>Who Will Benefit From Cuts in Capital Gains Taxes? </b> by William Beach <BR>

<P>
Beach points out that there are three major reasons why adopting
capital gains tax changes as defined in the Balance Budget Act
of 1995 will benefit nearly every American. First, the benefits
of cutting capital gains taxes go mostly to lower and middle income
tax-payers rather than to the wealthy. Second, economists who
have analyzed the economic effects of balancing the federal budget
while simultaneously cutting taxes (including the capital gains
tax) have all concluded that these policy changes result in widespread
economic benefits through a stronger, more productive economy.
And third, reducing the tax rate for capital gains actually would
increase tax revenues from tax-payers who own most appreciated
assets. 4 pp. (<I>F.Y.I. </I>#76)
<P>
 <li><a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi77.html">Balanced Budget Talking Points #3</a>: <b>What a Balanced Federal Budget With Tax Cuts Would Mean For Family College Costs,</b>
by John Barry <BR>

<P>
Among Barry's findings, the Balanced Budget Act developed by Congress
would mean the following: American families, over time, could
save an additional $14,066 per child in today's dollars to fund
college education costs as a result of the $500-per-child tax
credit; and an average student could save more than $414 over
the life of a 10-year student loan as a result of lower interest
rates. 3 pp. (<I>F.Y.I.</I> #77)
<P>
 <li><a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi75.html">Balanced Budget Talking Points #4</a>: <b>The $500-per-Child Tax Credit Means One Month's Food and Mortgage For a Typical American Family</b>
by Scott Hodge <BR>

<P>
Scott Hodge, Heritage Foundation Fellow in Federal Budgetary Affairs,
points out that a $500 tax cut for each child in working families
is not an insignificant amount of money, as many liberals believe.
Hodge shows that this tax cut would pump over $22 billion per
year into family budgets across the country. According to Hodge
millions of families will benefit, and Congress's $500-per-child
tax credit would eliminate the entire income tax burden for 3.5
million taxpayers caring for 8.7 children. 19 pp. (<I>F.Y.I.</I>
#75)
<P>
 <li><a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi78.html">Balanced Budget Talking Points #5</a>: <b>Clinton's $300-per-Child Tax Cut Plan Denies Tax Relief to 23 Million Children,</b> by Scott Hodge<BR>

<P>
Hodge shows that the Balanced Budget Act vetoed by President Clinton
on December 6th (with its $500-per-child tax cut for all children
in families earning up to $110,000) compared with Clinton's budget
(with its provision for a $300-per-child tax credit for dependent
children below age 13 in families with annual incomes below $75,000)
would benefit 5.4 million more low-income working families with
children earning below $24,000 per year, who would be denied the
$300 child tax credit under the Clinton plan. 8 pp. (<I>F.Y.I.</I>

<P>
 <li><a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi79.html">Balanced Budget Talking Points #6</a>: <b>What a Balanced Federal Budget With Tax Cuts Would Mean For Current and Future Retirees,</b>
by John Barry
<P>
Barry has found that under the congressional balanced budget plan
current retirees would gain additional after-tax income from a
reduction in the capital gains tax; and retirees have a significant
increase in real purchasing power over the next ten years due
to decreased inflation. Future retirees would benefit under the
Congressional proposal with the proposed &quot;super IRA&quot;
compared with saving the same amount in a conventional IRA; a
young couple raising one newborn child could save significantly
for their retirement by saving the $500-per-child annual tax credit,
while a young couple buying a home could save more for their retirement
from decreased monthly mortgage payments. 6 pp. (<I>F.Y.I.</I>

<P>
 <li><a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi80.html">Balanced Budget Talking Points #7</a>: <b>What Congress's Balanced Budget With Tax Cuts Would Mean For Housing,</B> by William Beach <BR>

<P>
According to an econometric analysis by William Beach, adoption
of the spending and tax policy changes contained in the Balanced
Budget Act of 1995 would likely lead to: 104,000 additional housing
starts worth $11 billion over the period 1996 through 2002; new
or improved housing for 1.8 million Americans; a drop in mortgage
interests rates, with total payments on a $100,000 mortgage about
$10,000 less in today's dollars over 30 years than a mortgage
purchased under current budget and tax law; and a 4 percent drop
in the cost of housing by 2002 (principally through decreases
in the cost of capital and lower interests rates), with the value
of existing housing maintained at or near current levels by the
growing demand for new homes. 3 pp. (<I>F.Y.I.</I> #80)

<h2>November <i>Insider</i>: On the Docket: A Look Ahead at the Supreme Court</h2></center><p>

Following its usual practice, the Supreme Court commenced its new term on the first Monday in October. Decisions in the cases argued before the Court should be handed down before the 1995-96 term is completed at the end of next June. Here is a brief overview of the cases to watch.
<P>
One of the most controversial cases is Romer v. Evans, where a Colorado state constitutional amendment barring protected status for homosexuals is being challenged as a denial of "equal protection of the laws," in violation of the U.S. Constitution's Fourteenth Amendment. When the case was argued last month, the Colorado official defending the law got a chilly reception from the Court. But it can be risky to predict a case's outcome based only on how the oral argument goes.
<P>
Another case that was recently argued is BMW of North America Incorporated v. Gore, which spotlights out-of-control jury damage awards. An Alabama jury awarded $4 million to a doctor who complained about his new car's paint job. The state supreme court cut it back to "only" $2 million, which understandably enough did not satisfy the defendant. The Court has taken a number of punitive damage cases in recent years, but has yet to offer clear guidance to the lower courts on how to tell when an award is unconstitutionally "excessive."
<P>
Last term the Court handed down a number of important civil rights cases, most of them conservative victories, as a slender majority of the justices insisted that racial preferences of all kinds be given strict scrutiny. This term's most important cases in this category_Shaw v. Hunt and Bush v. Vera_involve voting rights, and in particular the practice of drawing district boundaries with an eye toward "politically correct" racial outcomes. With the Clinton administration committed to racial preferences, and Congress so far unwilling to act, the Court appears to be the only branch of the federal government willing to resist racial balkanization.
Another important civil rights case, which the Court just recently 
agreed to hear, is United States v. Virginia. This is the "VMI case," challenging the constitutionality of single sex, state-run military academies, namely the Virginia Military Institute and the Citadel. This controversy drew a great deal of attention last summer when Shannon Faulkner briefly attended the Citadel.
<P>
Two other cases likely to generate publicity are Bennis v. Michigan, in which a wife is challenging the forfeiture of the family car when her husband used it to pick up a prostitute, and Lewis v. Casey, in which Arizona's state-prison libraries were ordered by a federal judge to provide inmates with a variety of amenities. Bennis is important because law-enforcement agencies have been very aggressive recently in using forfeiture laws, especially against drug dealers. Lewis provides the Court with a chance to cut back on the federal judiciary's micromanagement of state prison systems_just as it cut back on its micromanagement of school systems last term in Missouri v. Jenkins.
<P>
Other important cases which the Supreme Court will hear this year involve Indian gambling casinos, whether there is a jury-trial right in patent cases, claims against the manufacturers of Agent Orange, whether the federal census illegally undercounted members of minority groups, the First Amendment implication of limits on liquor advertising, the extent to which some computer software can be copyrighted, the sentencing in the Rodney King case, and whether telephone companies can be prevented by the federal government from getting into the cable television business.
<P>
Finally, keep in mind that the Court has so far scheduled relatively few cases to be heard this term, even considering the fact that its docket has shrunk dramatically from just a few years ago. Consequently, the Court is expected to add quite a few cases to its agenda over the next few weeks and months.

<b>Forced Justice: School Desegregation and the Law</b><br>
by David J. Armor, Oxford University Press (1995)
<P>
In his new book, <i>Forced Justice: School Desegregation and the Law</i> (Oxford University Press), David J. Armor, Research Professor at the Institute of Public Policy at George Mason University, offers his readers a thoroughly professional overview of one of the most controversial areas of public policies of the last forty years -- school desegregation. A conservative, Armor writes in a non-threatening, academic style that allows him to tread in controversial academic waters and reach conservative conclusions without scaring away the ideologically liberal reader. One suspects that even the most defiant apologist of forced busing and race-conscious education policies will, upon reading this book, be forced to admit that the world is a more complicated place than it appeared to be in 1954 when the Supreme Court rendered its decision in Brown v. Board of Education.
Brown undoubtedly contributed to the sea change in popular opinion on racial issues in this country, as illustrated by polling data that shows the steady upward movement in the percentage of whites who believe that black and white students should attend the same schools -- from about one-third in 1942 to 95 percent in 1990. But the decision also legitimized one of the most pernicious legal developments of our time, the judicial use of social science theory in deciding important constitutional law cases. In this case, the Court accepted the questionable "harm and benefit" thesis, which Armor defines as the notion that: 
<P><bq>
"school desegregation is harmful to the social, psychological, and educational development of children, both minority and white, and that school desegregation is beneficial for undoing or at least ameliorating the damages from segregation and discrimination." 

</bq><P>
Have the last four decades been kind to this thesis? After an exhaustive review of the research literature, Armor concludes that academic achievement among blacks is most strongly related, not to whether the student sits in a desegregated classroom, but to the "educational and economic characteristics" of his family and even to federal compensatory programs such as the Chapter 1 program. Armor also summarizes the research findings on the question of whether desegregation enhances black self-esteem, another key element of the harm and benefit thesis, and concludes: 
<P>
The research on black self-esteem over the past thirty years not only fails to support the harm and benefit thesis, then, but indeed seems to turn the thesis on its head. First, school segregation appears not to harm self-esteem of black students in the first place...and in many cases segregated black students have higher self-esteem than white students. Second, desegregation not only fails to improve black self-esteem but may in fact <b>lower it</b>. (emphasis added)
<P>
If, in 1954, the Court had resisted the temptation to substitute shaky social science for sound constitutional principles, how many young schoolchildren, both black and white, might have been spared those long and painful bus rides to distant schools to fulfill the social engineer's dream of perfect racial integration in the schools?  
<P>
What does the research literature tell us about whether whites abandon public school systems that are implementing court-ordered desegregation plans, the so-called phenomena of "white flight"? As Armor describes it, in 1975 social scientists began to suspect that "desegregation was accelerating white flight above and beyond that caused by other demographic processes." Armor himself conducted a comprehensive study of fifty-four court-ordered plans and found:
<P><bq>
"In central-city school districts with higher percentages of black enrollment, I found mandatory busing to raise white loss rates by three to five times that due to underlying demographic processes...[T]his study estimated that over a five-year period about half of the total white enrollment loss was due to the busing plans and the other half was due to normal demographic processes such as declining birth rates and net out-migration rates."
</bq><P>
Armor suggests that inconvenience, rather than racial prejudice, may account for much of this result: "the highest no-show rate is for Los Angeles, which had the longest average busing distance of any of the plans [55 minutes for a one-way bus ride]." Elsewhere, he points to data that parents weigh the quality of the individual school, rather than race, most heavily before deciding to move their children to other schools.
<P>
Try as he might to present both sides of a rather complicated argument, Armor nonetheless leaves the reader feeling quite frustrated with the current state of affairs, both politically and in the courts.
<P>
Thanks to David Armor, we now have a better understanding of the strengths and (mostly) weaknesses of school desegregation.

The House-Senate Conference Should Agree to Rapid Deployment of Missle Defenses</b>, by Baker Spring<br>
Backgrounder No. 1054, The Heritage Foundation
<P>
Baker Spring, a senior policy analyst at The Heritage Foundation, recommends that the members of the House and Senate military oversight committees who make up the conference committee should not settle for a weak bill that postpones deployment or takes the US ballistic missile defense program down a dead-end road. Spring recommends the committee adopt the following in order to send a clear message to the administration: deploy affordable and highly effective theater missile defense systems as soon as possible; deploy at the earliest possible date an affordable and highly effective national missile defense system that can be augmented to provide a layered defense; and improve existing cruise missile defense capabilities. This paper includes an appendix detailing recommended changes to the House and Senate versions of the bill as well as outling recommended goals for the conference committee, broken down into the following areas: statements of policy; theater missile defense; national missile defense; the future of the ABM Treay; interpreting the ABM Treaty; reporting requirements; and funding for missile defense. 11 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail Insider@heritage.org.

Mexico: Policy Failure, Moral Hazard, and Market Solutions, </b>by W. Lee Hoskins and James W. Coons<br>

Policy Analysis No. 243, Cato Institute
<P>
Lee Hoskins and James Coons, respectively the CEO and vice president of the Huntington National Bank in Columbus, Ohio, point out that for the fourth time in the past 20 years, the Mexican economy is in financial distress, largely due to the poor monetary policies pursued by Mexican officials. The authors suggest that the consistent American practice of lending money to the Mexican government has created a set of perverse incentives which ensure the "crisis" will reappear on an even larger scale. Hoskins and Coons suggest that the best course for the future is to encourage market forces, stronger private property rights, price stability, and a floating exchange rate for the peso. The authors write, "The United States should pass legislation that eliminates the Treasury's ability to make foreign loans and that removes the ability of the Federal Reserve to extend credit to foreign central banks directly or indirectly by funding the Exchange Stabilization Fund." 18 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Ave., NW, Washington, DC  20001, 202/842-0200.

Ukraine: Back from the Brink, </b> by Taras Kuzio
<br>
European Security Study No. 23, Institute for European Defence and Strategic Studies
<P>
Taras Kuzio, research fellow for the Centre for Russian and East European studies at the University of Birmingham, argues that Ukraine, more so than any other former Soviet Republic, was left with one of the most difficult legacies. According to the author, Ukraine is divided between an eastern region with a large population of Russian speakers and culture and a western area in which traditional Ukrainian language and culture predominate. Kuzio presents his analysis of the tenure of the Ukraine's president, Leonid Kravchuk and describes his efforts to handle the early stages of the dissolution of the Soviet Union, stressing reconciliation and consensus and thus avoiding ethnic tension and social instability. The author then presents a look at how the new president, Leonid Kuchma, has been able to address the problems that Kravchuk did not deal with effectively: economic and social stagnation and an increasing drift in Ukrainian foreign policy. The latter half of this paper addresses three lingering problems for Ukraine: 1) the building of a truly democratic political system is still inhibited by electoral apathy and the weakness of political parties; 2) while regional tensions have abated, the evolution of a generally accepted Ukrainian identity will be necessary; and 3) progress towards the settlement of the Crimean issue and Ukraine's general security might  be threatened by a more aggressively nationalistic Russian leader in the future. Kuzio concludes, "Western support for an independent Ukraine confident within its borders will ensure European security and stability at a crucial moment in the post-soviet transition process." 37 pp. CONTACT: Institute for European Defence and Strategic Studies, St. George's House, 14/17 Wells Street, London, W1P 3FP ENGLAND, 0171-637-2152, or fax 0171-637-2155.

America's Stake in Hong Kong, </b> by Brett C. Lippencott
<br>
Asian Studies Center Backgrounder No. 137, The Heritage Foundation
<P>
Brett Lippencott, policy analyst in The Heritage Foundation's Asian Studies Center, argues that the strong showing of pro-democracy candidates in Hong Kong's October legislative elections is a clear signal that the people do not trust Beijing's pledges to respect their autonomy and freedoms. Lippencott demonstrates that Hong Kong is America's 12th largest trading partner, with 1994 two-way trade in excess of $21 billion. The paper maintains that the US has a direct interest in Beijing's compliance with its pledges to respect Hong Kong's autonomy. Lippencott suggests the following conditions of the Basic Law which Beijing must respect after 1997: continuation of Hong Kong's autonomy and prosperity; the existence of a free market; commitment to such democratic and open institutions as a free press; preservation of Hong Kong's apolitical, independent civil service; the rule of law built upon the inviolability of human rights and civil liberties; maintenance of Hong Kong's independence in fiscal and taxation matters; and cooperation between Hong Kong and foreign law enforcement authorities. 7 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail Insider@heritage.org.

How to Close Down the Department of Labor</b> by Mark Wilson
<br>
Backgrounder No. 1058, The Heritage Foundation
<P>
Mark Wilson, Heritage's Rebecca Luken's Fellow in Labor Policy, reveals that the Department of Labor has become one of the most pervasive regulatory agencies in the federal government.  Wilson advocates closing this Cabinet-level department and moving key national functions to sub-Cabinet agencies or other departments. Wilson recommends that Congress take the following steps: 1) devolve financing and funding for the Unemployment Insurance Services to the states; 2) consolidate all job training programs for the economically disadvantaged into a state block grant; 3) consolidate all other job training programs into a state workforce development block grant; 4) reform the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and combine it with the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA); 5) transfer the Pension and Welfare Benefit Administration to the Social Security Administration; 6) repeal and nullify outdated labor laws, executive orders, and regulations; 7) combine the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Census Bureau in a newly created sub-Cabinet agency, the Bureau of National Statistics; and 8) close down the Office of the American Workplace and nullify Executive Order 12954 (striker replacement). Wilson writes, "The 104th Congress has a rare opportunity to initiate fundamental reforms in the administration and enforcement of America's labor laws. The primary objectives of this effort should be: reduce excessive burdens on businesses and job creation while maintaining workplace health and safety, and improve labor market flexibility while maintaining basic employee protections." 29 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail Insider@heritage.org.

Saying Goodbye When the Job is Done: The Coming Privatization of Government-Sponsored Enterprises, </b>by Thomas H. Stanton
<br>
IPI Policy Report No. 133, The Institute for Policy Innovation
<P>
Tom Stanton, a fellow of the Center for the Study of American Government at the Johns Hopkins University, states that government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Sallie Mae pose a needless $1.5 trillion liability to taxpayers and should be privatized. Stanton writes, "Today, Farmer Mac is requesting changes to its charter that would increase taxpayer risk, and give it advantage over its private competitors. As proven by the Savings and Loan debacle, such massive taxpayer liabilities are not risk-free." The report addresses the individual situations of the Student Loan Marketing Association (Sallie Mae), the Federal Home Loan Banks, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation (Farmer Mac), and the Farm Credit System. Stanton concludes that, if the GSEs are not privatized, the taxpayer liability of GSEs will continue to grow at a rapid rate, and will only add to the total hidden taxpayer liability that lurks beyond the national debt. 22 pp. CONTACT: The Institute for Policy Innovation, 25 South Stemmons, Suite 306, Lewisville, TX  75057, 214/219-0811.

Archer Daniels Midland: A Case Study in Corporate Welfare</b>, by James Bovard
<br>
Policy Analysis No. 241, Cato Institute
<P>
James Bovard, an associate policy analyst with the Cato Institute, reveals that the Archer Daniels Midland Corporation (ADM) has been one of the most prominent recipients of corporate welfare in recent years, funding both political parties with millions of dollars of handouts in return for billion dollar windfalls from taxpayers and consumers. Bovard writes, "Thanks to federal protection of the domestic sugar industry, ethanol subsidies, subsidized grain exports, and various other programs, ADM has cost the American economy billions of dollars since 1980 and has indirectly cost Americans tens of billions of dollars in higher prices and higher taxes over that same period." This paper demonstrates how ADM has received at least 43 percent of its annual profits from products heavily subsidized or protected by the American government. Bovard puts these figures in perspective with the current debate over corporate welfare, examining the dynamics of corporate welfare by investigating ADM as a classic case study of how those subsidies are obtained, how the welfare state encourages such "rent seeking," and how such practices fundamentally corrupt the political life of a nation. 48 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Ave., NW, Washington, DC  20001, 202/842-0200.

Constraints Upon Privatization: A Case Study of the Israeli Experience, </b> by Avi Naider
<br>
Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs
<P>
Avi Naider provides a short history of the rise of state-owned enterprises throughout the world in the post-World War II era, and the general trend of governments subsequently to divest themselves of those interests. Naider then presents a case study of privatization efforts in Israel, an example of an advanced industrial country which has generally failed to meet its own goals and standards, according to the author. This paper suggests that the most significant constraints on Israel's privatization program have been political and social, and, although technical constraints have contributed to delays, they are unable to account for the fact that despite the government's stated commitment to privatization, the number of state owned enterprises in the 1990s have actually increased. Naider probes several obstacles to reform: 1) Israel's fragmented and contentious political system; 2) the maneuvering of ministers and bureaucrats to "protect their turf;" 3) the power of the country's federated labor union; 4) the preoccupation with national security; and 5) the country's socialist legacy. To further illustrate Israel's unique experience, a chapter is dedicated to a case study of Israel Chemicals, Ltd., a pivotal divesture failure. 68 pp. CONTACT: Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, Beit Milken, 13 Tel Hal Street, Jerusalem  92107, ISRAEL, fax 972-2-619112.

Metropolitan Economic Development in Wisconsin</b>
<br>
Report Vol. 8, No. 7, Wisconsin Policy Research Institute
<P>
This report, developed by the Urban Research Center of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, examines the impact of the recent economic growth in Wisconsin's largest metropolitan areas. The report, which uses jobs data from the Department of Industry, Labor and Human Relations, reveals several significant trends: Kenosha expands by creating jobs through small compaies, while its neighbor, Racine, remains stagnant; metropolitan Milwaukee continues to develop jobs, but at a slower rate than other large metropolitan areas; and smaller areas are experiencing a far more significant rate of job creation than the larger metropolitan areas. This report analyzes which industries grew most rapidly, whether single-site employers added more employment than establishments associated with multiple-site employers, whether existing employers are universally responsible for most employment gains in all regions, how important to overall growth employers are that added large numbers of employees, which size employer added the most employees, whether suburban areas are growing at the expense of the central cities, how much firm migration is occurring, and what are the earnings patterns. 32 pp. CONTACT: Wisconsin Policy Research Institute, 3107 N.

FDA Hazards: How FDA Red Tape Impacts Entrepreneurs and the U.S. Economy, </b> by Raymond J. Keating

Raymond Keating, chief economist with the Small Business Survival Foundation, reveals that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which has generally been held in high regard by Americans, has recently squandered much of this goodwill. At the cost of the consumer, the FDA, according to Keating, has stifled growth in many areas, including entrepreneurial medical devices, vitamins, and foods. Keating recommends bold reforms for the FDA: 1) the FDA should be scrapped in favor of a smaller agency geared toward safety and education; 2) efficacy should be left to the marketplace; 3) manufacturers and approval enterprises should be subject to the incentives of a sound legal system; 4) FDA bans on information about off-label uses of drugs should be lifted; 5) the US should negatiate and enter into agreements with other nations to recognize each other's drug and medical device approvals; and 6) incentives for investment in dynamic industries, like pharmaceuticals and medical devices, need to be enhanced. 25pp. CONTACT: Small Business Survival Foundation, 1320 Eighteenth Street, NW, Suite 200, Washington, DC 20036, 202/785-0238.

Which Tax Reform Plan is Best for America? </b>, by Daniel J. Mitchell
<br>
Backgrounder No. 1055, The Heritage Foundation
<P>
Daniel Mitchell, McKenna senior fellow in political economy at The Heritage Foundation, analyzes and grades the six current proposals for major tax reform: the Armey/Shelby flat tax, Specter flat tax, value-added tax, national sales tax, Nunn-Domenici USA tax, and the Gephardt 10 percent tax. Mitchell evaluates the tax proposals on nine different criteria, including the degree to which they lower tax rates, simplify the system, address the bias against savings and investment, and treat taxpayers fairly. This paper concludes that the plans based on the flat tax model developed by Stanford University professor Robert Hall and Hoover Institution senior fellow Alvin Rabushka score highest; direct consumption taxes also fare well, but proposals that more closely resemble the current system are graded the lowest. 16 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail Insider@heritage.org.

Eating Out Our Substance: How Taxation Affects Saving, </b> by Gary Robbins and Aldona Robbins
<br>
Policy Report No. 131, The Institute for Policy Innovation in cooperation with Center for the New West
<P>
Gary Robbins, John M. Olin senior research fellow at IPI, and Aldona Robbins, Bradley senior research fellow at IPI, find that in order to stimulate economic growth by increasing private savings, America's tax policy must be changed to remove the penalties on saving and investment. This report confirms that America's private saving rate has declined precipitously in recent years: between 1947 and 1994, private savings averaged 12.9 percent of aftertax income; today the savings rate hovers around 7 percent. The authors report that there is a significant historical relationship between the private saving rate and the tax treatment of capital: specifically, a 10 percent increase in the aftertax rate of return to capital will result in a 7-11 percent increase in saving. The authors conclude that reducing the difference between average and marginal tax rates will reduce the adverse effect of taxes on the economy, and moving to a system that ends the multiple taxation of capital will lead to higher rates of saving, labor productivity, and economic growth. 27 pp. CONTACT: The Institute for Policy Innovation, 25 South Stemmons, Suite 306, Lewisville, TX  75057, 214/219-0811.

The ABCs of the Capital Gains Tax, </b> by Stephen Moore and John Silvia
<br>
Policy Analysis No. 242, Cato Institute
<P>
Stephen Moore, director of fiscal policy studies at the Cato Institute, and John Silvia, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services, examine the historical experience with the capital gains tax in the United States, as well as the finding of more than 50 economic studies on capital gains taxation. The authors conclude that a capital gains tax cut would: 1) substantially raise tax collections and increase tax payments by the rich; 2) increase the rate of capital formation, economic growth, and job creation throughout the year 2000; 3) unlock hundreds of billions of dollars of unrealized capital gains, thus promoting more efficient allocation of capital; and 4) expand economic opportunities for the most economically disadvantaged workers by bringing jobs and new businesses to capital-starved areas, such as America's inner cities. Finally, the study argues that the capital gains tax is so economically inefficient_because of its punitive effect on entrepreneurship, thrift, and investment_that the optimal economic policy for the United States would be to abolish the tax entirely. 63 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Ave., NW, Washington, DC  20001, 202/842-0200.

Tax Fairness for the Elderly: Eliminating the Social Security Earnings Penalty, </b> by Stephen Entin

Policy Backgrounder No. 137, National Center for Policy Analysis

Stephen Smith, an economist with the Institute for the Research on the Economics of Taxation, suggests that repealing or at least raising the Social Security earnings limit would produce important benefits, including simplifying the tax code, lowering administrative costs, and greater choices for the elderly. Smith explains that, "even if the impact on the federal budget is negative, this concern is overbalanced by the tredmendous benefits to be had from this reform and can be alleviatedby other minor adjustments to benefit computation rules." The author explains how the current limit and tax treatment impose disincentives to working and saving. 11pp. CONTACT: National Center for Policy Analysis, DC Office, 727 15th Street, NW, 5th Floor, Washington, DC 20005, 202/628-6671.

Donald Rumsfeld, former member of Congress, White House Chief of Staff, and Secretary of Defense, as well as CEO of two major corporations, offers his views and experience on how to downsize government. Rumsfeld makes five suggestions: 1) define the core business of the federal government; 2) cut sharply and rapidly; 3) eliminate bureaucracies; 4) redesign the organizational chart, eliminating non-central departments that are no longer needed; and 5) avoid micromanaging. Rumsfeld then recommends three proposals for Congress: 1) stop giving members of Congress credit for pork; 2) privatize where possible; and 3) sell under-utilized assets. 12 pp. CONTACT: The Heartland Institute, 800 East Northwest Highway, Suite 1080, Palatine, IL  60067, 708/202-3060.

John Liu, Heritage Foundation policy analyst for health care, and Robert Moffitt, deputy director of domestic policy studies at Heritage, provide insight into the search for ways to preserve health insurance benefits for the elderly by changing Medicare from a highly bureaucratic government program into a dynamic system based on the market principles of consumer choice and competition. This report examines the inherent flaws in the current system, revealing that from its inception, the current Medicare system encouraged central planning and price controls, bureaucracy and red tape, and government standardized benefits. Liu and Moffitt offer readers ammunition to the complicated questions that result from reforming the Medicare system in terms of funding and benefits for the elderly. The report also addresses questions of how reform will affect doctors and competition for services. 35 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail Insider@heritage.org.

Improving Medicare: Nine Ways the House Medicare Bill Does It, </b> by John S. Tottie
<br>
Issues and Answers, Citizens for a Sound Economy
<P>
John Tottie, policy analyst at Citizens for a Sound Economy, writes, "The Medicare Preservation Act of 1995 proposed by the House leadership provides just what President Clinton's trustees of the Medicare program recently called for, `prompt, effective, and decisive action' to save Medicare." Tottie lists the following nine aspects of the House plan as major improvements in the Medicare plan: 1) the plan saves Medicare from bankruptcy by reducing the rate of spending increases; 2) it offers many private-sector alternatives, including medical savings accounts; 3) it would make it possible to provide more benefits at no extra cost; 4) it would allow beneficiaries to limit their out-of-pocket spending; 5) it allows insurers to offer beneficiaries financial incentives to spend wisely; 6) it  reduces fraud, waste, and abuse in several different ways; 7) it reduces government subsidies to Medicare recipients who do not need them; 8) it reduces unnecessary bureacracy and high administrative costs; and 9) it enable beneficiaries to escape the rationing in government-run Medicare. The author contends the House plan results in a "win-win" proposition: a better Medicare system for beneficiaries and increased savings for taxpayers. 9 pp. CONTACT: Citizens for a Sound Economy, 1250 H St., NW, Suite 700, Washington, DC  20005-3908, 202/783-3870.

Mark Litow, consulting actuary for Milliman & Robertson, Inc., and Peter Hendee, consulting actuary for Odell and Associates, developed a plan that would save the Medicare program for those beneficiearies who want to remain in the system and, at the same time, offer an array of choices to those who want other choices. Under this plan, individuals would have to choose between the Medicare program and a private voucher system. For those who choose to opt out of the Medicare program, the voucher amounts could be used to purchase private health insurance coverage such as a managed care plan, a medical savings account (MSA), or any new product the market develops. Any remaining voucher balance would be deposited into an MSA and the balance could be withdrawn to pay for routine medical care, or saved for long-term care expenses. This plan would produce a savings of $297 billion over the next seven years and meets the FY 1996 Budget Resolution reducing Medicare spending growth by $270 billion over seven years. 30 pp. CONTACT: Council for Affordable Health Insurance, 112 S.

Federal Agricultural Policy: A Harvest of Environmental Abuses, </b> by Jonathan Tolman

Jonathan Tolman, environmental policy analyst at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, argues that environmentalists have overlooked one of the largest sources of water pollution: agricultural runoff. Tolman states that agricultural runoff is now the number one source of pollution in the nation's rivers, streams, and lakes. The author argues that the farm programs, developed in an era before commercial pesticides, fertilizers, and modern farming techniques, have had and continue to have detrimental effects on the environment. Tolman cites damage to the Everglades from the US sugar program and damage to peanut crops from the USDA peanut program. The author concludes, "Overall, consumers, taxpayers, and the environment would be better off under a free market agricultural policy.

The Center is representing non-minority applicants to the University of Texas Law School in the first substantive constitutional challenge to racial preferences in student admission since Board of Regents v. Bakke (1978). In August 1994, a federal district judge in Austin, Texas held that certain aspects of the law school's admission process were unconstitutional. Specifically, the court held that the consideration of minority applicants by a separate minority admissions subcommittee deprived the plaintiffs of equal protection of the law. The court also noted in dicta that separate cut-off scores for minority applicants violated the equal protection clause. However, the court failed to award meaningful monetary or injunctive relief and the case is now pending on appeal to the Fifth Circuit.

Last year, the U.S. District Court in Richmond granted summary judgment to VCU and dismissed the case in the eve of trial.

NELF to Help Immigrant Workers in New Hampshire</b>

NELF will represent a group of New Hampshire women who sew garments in their homes. The Department of Labor (DOL) says these women are "employees" not "independent contractors." If DOL wins, these women will lose their jobs.
The case involves Gale River Designs ("Gale River"), a small clothing maker, located in Franconia, N.H. which makes garments for catalogue retailers such as Orvis and Motherwear. Gale River employs about 20 to 25 people at its offices and factory. In addition to 8 to 10 in-house workers, it contracts out sewing to about 16 at-home "sewers" in New Hampshire, Vermont and Massachusetts.
Gale River ships unassembled pieces to the sewers who finish the garments and ship them back to Gale River. Sewers are paid on a piece-work basis. They estimate that their compensation works out to $12-15 per hour spent sewing, well above minimum wage. Most are women, some refugees, who simply cannot work outside the home because they live in remote locations or care for small children or elderly relatives. Home work for Gale River is their only employment option.
After a lengthy investigation DOL charged Gale River with $38,000 in minimum wage and overtime violations. If DOL succeeds, Gale River's costs will increase and it will have to use only in-house sewers. That will mean unemployment and a return to poverty for the sewers.

 NELF Brief Supports WalMart's Right to Enter Vermont</b>
<br>
NELF is filing an amicus brief with the Vermont Supreme Court challenging the Vermont Environmental Board's rejection of an application to construct a new WalMart in St. Albans, Vermont. The Board overruled local approvals of the project in order to impose on St. Albans its view of how the local economy should grow.
WalMart has secured a site in St. Albans already zoned for commercial use. It has obtained all required state and local permits, except the one required by ACT 250, Vermont's strict land use law. The citizens of St. Albans voted 7-1 in favor of WalMart in a recent, non-binding referendum. Nonetheless the state Environmental Board denied WalMart the needed Act 250 permit. The Board's main objection to WalMart is that the new store would have a negative "net economic impact." The Board credited two economists' testimony that WalMart's superior service and prices would cause the failure of nearby retailers. WalMart vigorously contests that projection. Even if true, that kind of impact is not within the Board's mandate nor is it a decision a state-wide agency should be making.
The Environmental Board was created to weight traditional environmental issues like wetlands or endangered species. By rejecting WalMart, the Board is seeking to transform itself into a super economic planning agency. Without any statutory authority, the Board wants the power to decide a new business is "negative" and bar it. NELF's brief will rebut the Board's right to impose its views on the local community. The people of St. Albans can use their zoning and planning powers to select the mix of large and small stores they want in the town. They have decided in favor of WalMart and the Board has no business second-guessing that decision.

 Court of Appeals Decides Preseault Case</b>
<br>
After almost two years of deliberation, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C. decided Paul Preseault's precedent-setting "takings" case. By a 2-1 vote, with a very strong dissent, the court held that Mr. Preseault was not entitled to compensation from the United States for the federal approval of a bike trail over an abandoned railroad line across his Vermont property.
The court relied on a 1920 law which, it held, put purchasers on notice that federal law might "someday" be changed to allow such conversions. Since trains continued to run over the Preseaults' land for 55 years after the 1920 act, the court seems to be, as the dissent put it, attempting to duck the constitutional issue. When this case was last in the U.S. Supreme Court, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor suggested Mr. Preseault was entitled to compensation. NELF is drafting a petition to return the case to the Court, the only forum where the appeals court's error can be corrected.

Tight Restrictions Sought on LSC-Funded Representation in Drug Evictions</b>
<br>
In one city after another, efforts by public housing managers to stop drug dealing and drug abuse in low-income housing projects have repeatedly been frustrated by federally-funded legal services attorneys, who have used the courts to prevent evictions of tenants engaged in drug activity. In response to a recent Legal Services Corporation proposal to restrict the ability of legal services attorneys to represent public housing tenants who are being evicted for drug activity, WLF argued that the LSC's proposal did not go nearly far enough. WLF pointed out that the proposal would prohibit such representations only in cases where (1) an actual criminal prosecution for drug activity has been initiated, (2) the particular drug activity forming the basis of the prosecution threatened the health or safety of public housing residents or workers, and (3) the leaseholder is the person being prosecuted, not another member of the leaseholder's household (such as a relative or boyfriend). WLF argued that these limitations should be removed from the proposed rule because they make the overall prohibition essentially toothless.

On behalf of itself, the Center for Equal Opportunity, and the Allied Educational Foundation, WLF filed a brief in the U.S. Supreme Court opposing a Texas redistricting plan for congressional seats in Texas v. Vera. WLF argued that the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits a state from intentionally drawing district boundaries along racial lines. The evidence indicates that the Texas plan was drawn based on racial considerations to segregate black, Hispanic, and so-called "Anglo" voters. The Court's decision in the Texas case is expected to answer questions left open by the racial gerrymandering decisions of last June.

WLF Urges Rejection of Suit Against Sleepy Driver's Employer</b>
<br>
In Faverty v. McDonald's Restaurants of Oregon, WLF filed a brief in the Oregon Supreme Court arguing that McDonald's should not be held liable for a collision caused when a worker fell asleep at the wheel on the way home from a late shift. The lower court had agreed with the plaintiff's argument that McDonald's should have known the 18-year-old employee would be too tired to drive home safely after the shift. WLF argued that an employer is normally not liable for the off-duty, off-premises acts of its employees.

<b>
OSHA Encouraged to Recognize Privilege for Self-Evaluations</b>
<br>
WLF filed a petition for rulemaking with OSHA urging the agency to adopt a policy against seeking employers' internal evaluations or audits of workplace conditions. WLF argued that OSHA policy should reflect that these self-evaluations are indispensable to improving the health and safety of American workers. OSHA has created a powerful barrier to such initiatives by failing to recognize a privilege of confidentiality for employers' self-critical audits of workplace conditions. The petition also points out that OSHA has extensive record-keeping requirements and inspection powers with which to identify violations, without the need to deter self-evaluations.

<title>Heritage Foundation - September Insider - Hammering Out Welfare Reform in the Conference Committee</title>

<h2>October <i>Insider</i>: Hammering Out Welfare Reform in the Conference Committee</h2></center><p>
by Rick Dearborn, Director of Congressional Relations, U.S. Senate at The Heritage Foundation<br>
<hr>
<br>

Last week the U.S. Senate passed a welfare reform package that was solid on creating strong work requirements, but was weaker than the House of Representatives' version on the debate over curtailing the rampant illegitimacy rate. Both bills will now go to a conference, possibly lasting well into November, between both houses in order to iron out the differences.
Unless the Senate accedes to the House on its provisions denying additional monies to teenage welfare mothers who continue to have children, the bill that comes out of conference is likely to do little to discourage illegitimacy. On the flip side of the coin, it will be in the best interests of the U.S. taxpayer for the House to adopt the Senate's position on work requirements for able-bodied individuals on the public dole. <P>
The Senate provisions on work contain an important provision not currently found in the House bill, known as pay for performance.This provision states that welfare recipients may not receive their direct cash benefits until completing the work requirements. Under current law, if welfare recipients worked 80 percent of their required hours there would be no commensurate reduction in benefits. Special hearings to bring hours paid in line with hours worked nearly always favor the welfare recipients. The Senate bill does away with this problem by forcing welfare workers to do their work first and then be paid on the basis of how many hours they have completed. The House bill lacks the same commitment to stricter work requirements.<P>
Despite efforts by Senators Faircloth, Gramm, and Ashcroft, the Senate welfare reform package did not incorporate House reforms intended to ameliorate the problems of illegitimacy (many of which were first proposed by Heritage senior analyst Robert Rector). These three Senators fought hard for the inclusion of many of their bill's provisions. Among the amendments offered by the Faircloth/Gramm/Ashcroft team, expected to be issues in the conference committee, were policy proposals to cut off additional funds for teenage welfare mothers who continue to have children out-of-wedlock; provisions to deny only federal funds, not state funds, to minor mothers who are currently eligible to receive direct cash benefits in the mail or down at the social welfare center on the condition that they have children out-of-wedlock; a provision known as the illegitimacy ratio, that would provide an additional block grant to reward those states who curtail their ever-rising illegitimacy rate without increasing the rate of abortions within their state; and applying a four-day a-month work requirement to single, able-bodied males who currently receive food stamps and do not do any work.<P>
Although the illegitimacy ratio was adopted in the Senate bill, and a modified amendment regarding work requirements for food stamp recipients offered by Senator Jesse Helms was accepted, the denial of federal cash benefits to unwed teenagers, and the denial of federal cash benefits to welfare mothers who continue to have additional children (family cap) were not accepted by the U.S. Senate. <P>
The House conferees will be fighting to include their family cap provision. The Senate appointees appear unlikely to support the family cap but are likely to fight for stricter versions of workfare.<P>
 
Because of the many contentious items in both the House and Senate bills, the key to getting a strong reform proposal will be the appointment of conferees to the welfare Conference Committee. The House leadership plans to appoint members who are strong on both the work and illegitimacy issues. If Senator Dole places reform-minded individuals committed to solving America's welfare dilemma on the conference committee, he will help ensure that the end result will be a solid welfare reform package.

October <i>Insider</i> -- In Focus: Book Review<p>
</h2>
<i>By Corinne T. Coldwell</i><br>
<hr>

<b>Fatherless America</b>, by David Blankenhorn<br>
234 pp. BasicBooks, 1995
<P>
In <i>Fatherless America</i>, David Blankenhorn does not just list the repercussions of an ever-widening void of fathers in this country, he explains in frightening detail how society now regards fathers as superfluous. America  now has a society where the nuclear family is a rarity and divorce and single motherhood are commonplace. Now, children of fragmented families represent today's young generation. And unless this trend is reversed, nothing will repair the damage of fatherlessness. No amount of economic growth, welfare reform, prison construction, or school reform can cure the deeply rooted problems of male violence and lack of child well-being. Domestic policy reforms will fail when enacted upon a weak family structure. What can be done to restore and encourage strong two-parent families? Blankenhorn first discusses how the choices Americans made over the last few decades have denigrated traditional fatherhood. Then he elaborates on how these often selfish choices have not only affected society's perception of fatherhood, but have made them acceptable -- if not ideal. <P>

According to Blankenhorn, the fatherless crisis began during and after World War II when draft quotas could no longer be filled by only single men and married men without children. The Selective Service had to turn to fathers (approximately 6 million men) to fulfill their needs. During the war years,  fathers left home out of duty and loyalty to their country, and their memories were kept alive in a more positive light. Today's fathers, however, are largely absent from the home by choice. When fathers die due to illness or are killed at war their presence still looms over their children. The 1940s child could say: "My father had to leave for a while to do something important." The 1990s child must say: "My father left me permanently because he wanted to." This fatherless crisis did have  negative effects on the family, because many men came home feeling ill-prepared for fatherhood (in some cases the children were born while they were away) and many women had to find work in factories in order to survive. These circumstances sometimes led to tensions in the home, separation, or divorce. But this was only the first tier of problems that brought us to our situation today. The second fatherless crisis is more of "an unorganized dispersal of men for private purposes, regrettable but acceptable."<P>

Blankenhorn gives analysis of several types of fathers as viewed in academia and described by the media: the Deadbeat Dad, the Visiting Father, the Sperm Father, the Stepfather, and the Nearby Guy. Mr. Blankenhorn devotes the most insightful evaluation of the deadbeat dad in the wake of his notorious villain status in society that began in the late 1980s. Yet, as Blankenhorn points out, the deadbeat dad is really a caricature of the traditional male role. Even though he is absent, he is expected to be a provider. However, the new father (the cultural experts' ideal father) repudiates the traditional male role because he is more concerned about being a partner than worrying about monetary gain for his family. The descriptions of the new father and the deadbeat dad, as defined by the scholars and perpetuated in the media, obviously contradict one another. The distinct message coming from the "wanted: deadbeat dads" signs is that absent fathers can still be fathers as long as they write the checks. The deadbeat  dad is essentially the unnecessary father who refuses to pay. And "from the child's perspective, child-support payments, even if fully paid, do not replace a father's economic provision. More fundamentally, they do not replace a father." The necessity to hunt for deadbeat dads is tragic. What is even worse is the fact that we just want their money, not everything else that fatherhood provides for children. The money will allow for some things the children need and places they want to go, but only mothers and fathers can help shape children's character.<P>

 The danger in the status quo is making these lowered standards permanent. Mr. Blankenhorn illustrates that defeatist attempts to solve the problems of single motherhood lack an understanding of the root causes of fatherlessness in this country. The most important aspect of parenthood, "development of competence and character in children," needs to be understood first before any policy is initiated. One parent cannot do that alone: "If fatherhood has anything to say to men, it is that human completion is not a solo act."<P>

Blankenhorn offers a dozen initiatives to help inject the value of fatherhood back into communities. He suggests: the President should give an annual report on the state of fatherhood; communities should ask married fathers play a part in transforming public housing; Congress should pass a resolution stating that the first question of policymakers regarding all domestic legislation is whether it will strengthen or weaken the institution of marriage; well-known professional athletes could be drafted to promote the virtues of fatherhood; and prominent family scholars could write new textbooks for high school students about marriage and parenthood. Blankenhorn admits that his proposals are not answers, but attempts to ask a new question: "Does our society wish to recover the fatherhood idea?" If the answer is no, then proposals like his will go nowhere. But if the answer is yes, then his proposals will at the very least lead us  away from "a culture of fatherlessness" to a culture of fatherhood.<P>

<b>Dirty Tricks or Trump Card: US Covert Action and Counterintelligence</b><br>
 by Roy Godson<br>
National Strategy Information Center, Inc.<P>
Roy Godson, professor of government at Georgetown University, contends that covert operations are the missing element in the discussions about the future of US intelligence. Godson traces the history of US covert action and counterintelligence as well as its successes and failures. This volume suggests that the potential uses of covert action and counterintelligence amid new security challenges have rarely been discussed. Godson states that, although controversial, covert operations can be seen as simply one among many instruments of foreign policy_that they are neither "exceptional tools nor magic bullets." 342 pp. CONTACT: Kelley Beagher, Brassey's, 1313 Dolly Madison Blvd., Suite 401, McLean, VA 22101, 703/442-4535,  fax 703/442-9848.

<b>How to Close Down the Department of Commerce</b><br>
 by Joe Cobb<br>
Backgrounder No. 1049, The Heritage Foundation<P>

Joe Cobb, Heritage's John M. Olin senior fellow in economics, notes that the 1996 budget resolution's call for the elimination of the US Department of Commerce is both symbolic of the change in philosophy in Congress and a practical proposal to restructure a collection of programs and agencies that have little reason to share a common organizational structure. Cobb supports Congress's idea of closing the Department of Commerce, suggesting that the Department is "little more than a collection of disparate programs" which are beyond reinvention. This paper notes that the Commerce Department has 20 undersecretary and assistant secretary offices, six directors and administrators, 263 political appointees, and shares four budgetary functions with eight other Cabinet and sub-Cabinet departments. Cobb's recommendations include the following: a) close down the Office of the Secretary and Departmental Administration; b) consolidate the Bureau of the Census and other federal statistical agencies, including the Economics and Statistical Administration, within a single new independent agency; c) transfer trade functions to the Treasury Department, including the International Trade Administration; d) close the domestic offices of the US and Foreign Commercial Service; e) establish the Patent and Trademark Office as an independent corporation; and f) privatize the National Technical Information Service. Cobb supports allowing the Department, which would be the first in history to be dismantled, three years to terminate programs, reassign civil service personnel, and dispose of surplus property. 23 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 565, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail 74157.372@compuserve.com.<P>

<b>How to Privatize Orange County's Airports</b> by Robert W. Poole, Jr.<br>
Policy Study No. 194, Reason Foundation<p>

Robert Poole, president of the Reason Foundation, cites two major problems with Orange County's decision to sell John Wayne Airport: 1) the potential of serious competition from a future airport at El Toro, which might prematurely draw traffic away from John Wayne; and 2) the likelihood of litigation by the airlines who contend that a municipality may not legally make use of the proceeds from the sale of an existing federally aided airport. This study identifies several different types of airport privatization, including contract management, lease, and sale, and outlines the legal status of each with respect to federal grants and constraints. Poole recommends two types of privatization, in a coordinated fashion, to solve Orange County's dilemma_the county should seek a single firm that will enter into two separate agreements: 1) a long-term contract to manage John Wayne airport and 2) a purchase or lease agreement under which the firm will develop a commercial airport at El Toro. The author notes that development of the latter will be closely coordinated with future activities at the former, to ensure the continued financial viability of John Wayne Airport through the years needed to retire its outstanding bonds. 15 pp. CONTACT: Reason Foundation, 3415 S.

<b>Designing a Comprehensive State-Level Privatization Program: How-To Guide #1</b><br>
 by William D. Eggers<br>
Washington Institute for Policy Studies<P>

William Eggers, director of the Reason Foundation's privatization center, presents this guide as the first in a series of seven  on the topic of state government privatization. Eggers recommends that states develop comprehensive, forward-looking privatization programs rather than adopting piecemeal approaches. This paper offers nine basic steps for designing a systematic, comprehensive program: 1) develop the institutional structure for privatization; 2) set up a program of adjustments and incentives for public employees; 3) identify privatization techniques; 4) identify state services and assets that offer opportunities for privatization; 5) determine the legislative and executive barriers to privatization and revise or rescind these; 6) consider introducing mandatory competitive incentives into the delivery of certain state and local services; 7) evaluate the feasibility of privatizing identified privatization opportunities; 8) determine the potential cost savings from privatizing services and assets selected for privatization; and 9) prepare a plan for implementation. 28 pp. CONTACT: Washington Institute for Policy Studies, 999 Third Ave., Suite 1060, Seattle, WA 98104, 206/467-9561.<P>


<b>A National ID System: Big Brother's Solution to Illegal Immigration</b><br>
 by John J. Miller and Stephen Moore<br>
Policy Analysis No. 237, Cato Institute<p>

John Miller, vice president of the Center for Equal Opportunity, and Stephen Moore, director of fiscal policy studies at the Cato Institute, describe the efforts by some legislators in the House and Senate to create a national computer registration system for all American workers as "Orwellian." Miller and Moore write, "The computer registry and national ID card, which would confer on the federal government vast new police-state powers, is highly incompatible with the Republican theme of expanding freedom and reducing government." This paper cites three major problems with the current proposals: 1) the identification system could be easily expanded to include other purposes beyond deterring illegal immigration, such as implementation of Clinton-style health security card, conducting background checks on individuals, and enforcing affirmative action laws and other government regulations; 2) the system would cost the federal government between $3 billion and $6 billion per year to administer; and 3) error rates that are commonplace for government databases would lead to hundreds of thousands of Americans being denied legal access to the workforce. The authors conclude that a computer registry would impose large costs on American citizens in terms of both dollars and lost liberties. 23 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Ave., NW, Washington, DC 20001, 202/842-0200.<P>

<b>How to Solve Mandatory Auto Insurance</B><br>
 by John Semmens<br>
Issue Analysis Report No. 5, Goldwater Institute<P>

John Semmens, winner of the Goldwater Institute's Reinventing Government competition in 1994, proposes privatizing automobile registration and driver's licenses. In this plan, private insurance companies license drivers and register automobiles, allowing drivers to deal with a single, private agency. Semmens also proposes requiring full insurance for drivers that insurance companies choose to cover, stating that private registration, along with full coverage of drivers, is likely to do a better job of taking irresponsible drivers off the road and make those who cause accidents fully liable for the dollar damage they cause. The author criticizes the current system for allowing underinsured and uninsured motorists to escape liability for much of the damage they cause to others and their property. Semmens contends that uninsured motorists will be easy to identify since they will have no privately issued license tag. 10 pp. CONTACT: Goldwater Institute, Bank One Center-Concourse, 201 N.

<b>Taxpayer Choice: A Common Sense Solution to the Crisis of the Welfare State</b><br>
 by John C. Goodman<br>
Issue Analysis Report No. 4, Goldwater Institute<p>

John Goodman, the 1995 John M. Olin winter fellow at the Goldwater Institute, offers evidence that the only way to reform welfare is to end the federal government's monopoly on welfare tax dollars. In order to combat the perverse incentives inherent to the current welfare programs, Goodman recommends allowing individual taxpayers to give up to 40 percent of their personal income taxes (the amount currently spent on federal welfare programs) to any qualified charity, public or private. According to the author's plan, the government would then be required to subtract a dollar from public welfare programs for every dollar given. 51 pp. CONTACT: Goldwater Institute, Bank One Center-Concourse, 201 N.

<B>Combatting Illegitimacy and Counseling Teen Abstinence: A Key Component of Welfare Reform</B><BR>
 by Joseph J. Piccione and Robert A. Scholle<BR>
Backgrounder No. 1051, The Heritage Foundation<p>

Joseph Piccione and Robert Scholle, both former policy analysts in the Office of Population Affairs in the US Department of Health and Human Services during the Bush administration, address the role of soaring illegitimacy rates in America's social fabric. The authors recommend abandoning the pragmatic "contraceptive approach" to adolescent pregnancy. Instead the authors support the "abstinence approach," which incorporates the basic cultural and psychological realities of the transition to adulthood. Piccione and Scholle support a three-pronged approach for young people to avoiding poverty and dependency: complete high-school; get a job, even a low paying one; and have children only within marriage. The authors recommend funding education for such a program with $200 million in block grants to the states through the Maternal and Child Health Services. 21 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 565, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail 74157.372@compuserve.com.<P>

Larry Arnn, president of The Claremont Institute, and Thomas West, a senior fellow at The Claremont Institute, posits the question, "What should be the welfare system of California 25 years from now?" The article answers the question with ideas that support family and work, respect for education and marriage, disdain for illegitimacy and compassion for the deserving poor. The authors write, "It [California's welfare system] must rely in large part upon the initiative of private parties and organizations; in other words it must be again a system of charity and not of interest-group driven public policy.

<b>Reforming Medicaid</b><BR>
 by James R. Cantwell<br>
Policy Report No. 197, National Center for Policy Analysis<P>
James Cantwell of the Congressional Budget Office argues that any attempt to balance the budget will be futile without reforming Medicaid. Cantwell presents six steps to achieve Medicaid savings of $185.4 billion over seven years without any reduction in benefits for needy people: 1) changing incentives for recipients through Medical Savings Accounts and/or managed care would produce a $37.2 billion savings in acute care programs and $64 billion in long term care; 2) enforcing estate recovery provisions would produce savings of $35 billion; 3) redirecting and capping disproportionate share hospital payments would produce savings of $13.9 billion; 4) reducing administrative costs would produce a savings of $3.7 billion; 5) making Medicaid the payer of last resort would produce savings of $31.5 billion; and 6) reducing waste, fraud, and abuse through greater state vigilance would produce savings of an unknown but substantial amount. This paper presents statistical evidence and analysis for each of the points, concluding that the savings for seven years would total at least $185.4 billion. 14 pp. CONTACT: National Center for Policy Analysis, 12655 N.

<b>FDA Censorship Can Be Hazardous to Your Health</b><br>
 by David R. Henderson<br>
Policy Brief No. 158, Center for the Study of American Business<p>

David Henderson, adjunct fellow at the Center for the Study of American Business, argues that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is censoring valuable information about drugs that could help doctors treat their patients more effectively. Henderson reports that the FDA routinely challenges drug companies that distribute articles from medical journals reporting positive, but not necessarily FDA-approved, uses of their drugs. According to the author, no matter how close the recommended off-label use is to an approved use, the FDA's Division of Drug Marketing will stop a drug company from sending out medical journal articles that recommend, or even mention such an application. Henderson notes that 40 to 50 percent of all drugs are prescribed for off-label uses. This paper suggest that this new, expanded role of the FDA is the result of bureaucratic ingenuity, not congressional action, which could result in the loss of life. Henderson endorses eliminating the role of the FDA as a censor for advertising, returning this function to the Federal Trade Commission, which was responsible for this regulation before 1962. 17 pp. CONTACT: Center for the Study of American Business, Washington University, Campus Box 1208, St. Louis, MO 63130-4899, 314/935-5630.<P>

<b>Outcome-Based Education: Miracle Cure or Plague?</b><br>
 by Brunno V. Manno<br>
Mackinac Center Report, Mackinac Center for Public Policy and Hudson Institute<P>
Brunno Manno, a senior fellow in Hudson's education policy studies program, attempts to explain why enormous conflicts over outcome-based education exist, suggesting that the original intent of outcome-based education was productive. Manno maintains that when states began efforts to institute these programs, they turned over the crucial task of defining outcomes over to the very education establishment figures threatened by the process. Having adopted in principle the focus on results (originally intended to be academic results), the educators presented lists of outcomes that emphasized values, attitudes and behavior, and often reflect quasi-political or ideologically correct positions. Dr. Manno shows how this process occurred in various states, then proposes a twofold policy strategy that provides a way out of the dilemma: establish high, uniform academic standards and a system of accountability with real consequences for success and failure; and create greater diversity in the kinds of schools we finance, how we pay for them, and the ways educators provide solid academic achievement, with parents free to choose the schools that best meet their needs. 24 pp. CONTACT: Mackinac Center for Public Policy, 119 Ashman St., P.O.

<b>Teacher, Inc.: A Private-Practice Option for Educators</b><br>
 by Janet R. Beales<br>
Mackinac Center Report, Mackinac Center for Public Policy and Reason Foundation<P>
Janet Beales, policy analyst with the education studies program of the Reason Foundation, discusses private-practice teacher contracts as an option to schools and communities looking for new ways to provide education. Beales describes private-practice teachers as professional educators who provide their services to schools or other entities, on a contract basis, helping school officials strengthen accountability, cut costs, and increase flexibility. In turn, according to the author, the contract arrangement elevates the professional status of teachers, allowing teachers to take control of their own careers, negotiate their own compensation, and make their own decisions about how to use time, resources and methodologies. This study profiles the experiences of a number of private-practice educators and discusses the benefits that schools may realize by contracting for instruction. In addition, this study presents results from two national surveys about the legal authority of school boards to contract for instruction and also provides a chart to help administrators identify the fully allocated costs of in-house and contract service. 23 pp. CONTACT: Mackinac Center for Public Policy, 119 Ashman St., P.O.

Denis Doyle, president of his own education research organization, an analyst at The Heritage Foundation and formerly associated with the Hudson Institute, asserts that public school teachers and administrators are in a unique position to assess the quality of public education for their own children. Doyle writes, "The data is clear: in the largest urban areas, public school teachers are more likely than the population at large to enroll their children in private schools. By and large it is the poor and dispossessed, particularly in large, troubled urban areas, who are forced into the nation's public schools. But these schools are so unattractive that the teachers pay significant sums of money to send their children elsewhere. 12 pp. CONTACT: Hudson Institute, Herman Kahn Center, P.O.

<b>The Freedom to Farm Act (H.R. 2195): Key Changes Will Improve Potential for Serious Agriculture Reform</b><br>
by John Frydenlund<br>
Issue Bulletin No. 211, The Heritage Foundation
<P>
John Frydenlund, director of Heritage's Agriculture Policy Project, praises the Freedom to Farm Act as a good first step toward reforming agricultural policy. Frydenlund points out that the bill accomplishes several significant goals: replacing traditional payments for commodity programs with transition payments that decline over a period of seven years; eliminating supply controls; and extricating the federal bureaucracy from the decision-making process of planting requirements. Frydenlund, however, makes several recommendations to strengthen the Act and to dramatically reform the current system:1) specify an exact date when programs will end, preferably no later that the year 2001, by deauthorizing current law; 2) prevent transition payments from becoming an unjustified windfall by specifying a trigger or price level for each commodity that would reduce or eliminate transition payments for a given year; and 3) eliminate the Conservation Reserve Program or at least drastically reduce the number of acres in the program. He suggests two methods for assuring that reforms embodied in the Freedom to Farm Act and other proposals are not circumvented: cap annual Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) spending at levels provided in the budget resolution and reduce CCC borrowing authority from $30 billion to $15 billion. Frydenlund forecasts that these changes will greatly improve and provide long-term reform for the agricultural system in America. 5 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 565, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail 74157.372@compuserve.com.

Dennis Avery, director of Hudson's Center for Global Food Issues, and Dave Juday, an agricultural businessman, observe that increasing budget restraints no longer allow Washington to hand prosperity to America's farmers by way of farm subsidies. The authors write, "Changes in US agricultural tax, trade, and regulatory policies could enhance the nation's rural prosperity quickly, not only for farmers but for off-farm rural residents who have too often been driven from their communities by cropland setasides." In order to correct the problems created by current agricultural policies, the authors  suggest that Congress broaden the focus of farm policy by passing an eleven point Contract with Rural America. The eleven points would focus on regulatory and tax relief and expanded trade opportunities. 8 pp. CONTACT: Hudson Institute, Herman Kahn Center, P.O.

Leal presents the findings from his studies of the economic and environmental performance of county and state foresters in Minnesota and Montana compared with that of Forest Service lands in the same region. Leal made comparisons between Superior National Forest and the St. Louis County forestlands and found that the county made more than $2 million from timber sales while Superior lost over $5 million on timber sales.

<b>Cleaning Up Superfund: The Case for State Environmental Leadership</b><br>
by J. Winston Porter<br>
Policy Study No. 195, Reason Foundation
<P>

Winston Porter, president of the Waste Policy Center, describes the Superfund program as one of the nation's most visible site remediation programs. Since the inception of Superfund in 1980, the program has received many criticisms, especially given that only 150 of the 1,300 designated sites have been cleaned in 15 years. According to the author, an undeservedly large portion of the funds have been used for legal proceedings. Porter examines an alternative approach to Superfund; the author recommends allowing the states to deal with the sites_at a fraction of the time and costs. Currently states are spending about $700 million annually working on about 11,000 sites, while the EPA spends approximately $1 billion annually dealing with about 1,000 sites. In this study, the author briefly reviews Superfund and the similar programs of the states; presents how-to steps to turn much of Superfund over to willing and able states; and recommends methods of state certification, funding provisions, EPA's continued role, and modification of the Superfund statute. 14 pp. CONTACT: Reason Foundation, 3415 S.

<b>Superfund Unplugged</b><br>

Issues and Answers, Citizens for a Sound Economy
<P>
Wayne T. Brough, director of research for Citizens for a Sound Economy, contends that the Superfund program_created in the wake of public concerns over toxic wastes at Love Canal_imposes billions of dollars in costs on consumers and local communities while providing few benefits in return. Brough suggests that the program's liability rules delay the clean-up process and impose inequitable costs on businesses and communities. Brough states, "The Superfund program requires fundamental reforms that implement sound risk management practices and a more cost-effective allocation of resources. At the same time, liability rules should be changed to eliminate perverse incentives that divert resources from environmental cleanups." This paper outlines the basics of Superfund reform as follows: allow states to play a greater role; privatize as many sites as possible; repeal retroactive liability; reform joint and several liability; institute no new taxes for Superfund; utilize risk based management and sound science; and create new mechanisms of public finance. 19 pp. CONTACT: Citizens for a Sound Economy, 1250 H St., NW, Suite 700, Washington, DC 20005-3908, 202/783-3870.

<b>Progressive Environmentalism: Principles for Regulatory Reform</b><br>
by Kent Jeffreys<br>
Policy Report No. 194, National Center for Policy Analysis

Kent Jeffreys, senior fellow at the National Center for Policy Analysis, argues that the solution for current environmental problems requires the government to act in accordance with certain pre-defined rules before enacting environmental legislation or approving any environmental regulations. The author suggests the following guidelines: 1) The Federalism Rule, which would require that all regulatory decisions be made by the smallest possible government entity; 2) The Cost-Benefit Rule, which requires that objective studies weigh the benefits against the costs of new regulations; and 3) The Compensation Rule, which requires the government to compensate innocent property owners for the loss of property rights or non-negligible losses of value. This study examines abuses of the three rules cited above in specific federal environmental programs and explores solutions that would bring the programs into compliance with the rules. 44 pp. CONTACT: National Center for Policy Analysis, 12655 N.

<b>Making Government Work: How Congress Can Really Reinvent Government</b><br> by Donald J. Devine<br>
Backgrounder No. 1050, The Heritage Foundation<P>

Donald Devine, former director of the US Office of Personnel Management and adjunct scholar at Heritage, recommends that the federal government should "return to the pre-Carter system of decentralized authority." Devine describes several problems with the administration's current proposals to reinvent government, writing that the plan: will weaken policies on hiring, promoting, and rewarding federal employees based on individual merit and performance; will eliminate presidential standards for job performance; will enhance federal agency and union control over setting salary levels; will weaken long-standing "veterans preference" standards; and will create a new role for federal unions that would undermine management authority for defining and assigning work. Devine makes specific recommendations for defining government's proper functions: devolve power to the states; define agency missions; privatize government functions; protect the merit system; establish responsibility; clarify rules; re-establish merit selection; make the hiring process rational; re-establish pay for performance; rationalize federal benefits; end duplication stop Clinton's devaluation of management responsibility; and consolidate the management of federal resources. 18 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 565, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail 74157.372@compuserve.com.<P>

<b>Campaign Finance Regulation: Faulty Assumptions and Undemocratic Consequences</B><br> by Bradley A. Smith<br>
Policy Analysis No. 238, Cato Institute<P>

Bradley Smith, assistant professor at Capital University Law School in Ohio, acknowledges that while efforts to limit political contributions and spending are extremely popular, no evidence exists that campaign finance regulation has achieved or will achieve its goals of reducing the influence of money, opening up the political system, and lowering the costs of campaigns. The author maintains that efforts to limit contributions and spending have been based on two faulty assumptions: that candidates spend too much per vote (total spending for candidates for all offices is less than $10 per eligible voter every two years) and that large donations are undemocratic (most challenges to the status quo and most working-class political movements have been financed by wealthy donors). Smith argues that, "Our current campaign finance regulations favor incumbents, stifle grassroots activity, distort and constrict political debate, and infringe on traditional First Amendment freedoms. There is little reason to believe that still more regulation and public funding will yield positive results." 26 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Ave., NW, Washington, DC 20001, 202/842-0200.<P>

<B>Only A Piece of Paper?: The Social Significance of the Marriage License and The Consequences of Cohabitation, Divorce and Stepfamilies</b><br> by Glenn T. Stanton<br>
Focus on the Family<P>

Glenn Stanton, a social research analyst for the public policy division of Focus on the Family, presents a compilation of statistical data, gathered since the 12th century, which reveals that marriage matters in the lives of children, adults, and societies. The results consistently show that marriage improves the physical and mental health as well as the  longevity of men and women. On the whole, this data shows that married people do better in every measure of specific and general well-being than their unmarried counterparts. The research reveals information about the benefits of marriage, the disadvantages of cohabitation, and the effects of remarriage and stepfamilies. Stanton concludes that, based on the statistical evidence, it is critical to rediscover a cultural norm for family life in America and hold it up as an ideal. Stanton writes, "The ideal should be the traditional two-parent family where mother and father strive for a healthy marriage and both participate in the daily care and nurturing of their biological or adopted children." 36 pp. CONTACT: Focus on the Family, 8605 Explorer Dr., Colorado Springs, CO 80920, 719/531-3400.<p>

<b>Multiculturalism and Economic Growth</b><br> by Gerald W. Scully<br>

Gerald Scully, senior fellow of the National Center for Policy Analysis, contradicts conventional wisdom by acknowledging that the work of most anthropologists identifies cultural diversity as a universal source of social conflict and often as a barrier to economic progress as well as personal freedom. Scully finds that cultural relativism has made the study of the role of culture in human progress controversial, but he points out that intergroup enmity is widespread in culturally heterogeneous societies. This study shows that cultural diversity and a lack of economic freedom go hand in hand. Scully writes, "For all its problems, the West has managed cultural conflict better than the rest of the world because it has free economic, civil and political institutions...despite this success, we are moving away from the notion of individual freedom to that of group rights in the United States." Based on his study of cultural conflict and economic progress, Scully recommends that the Third World move towards freer economic institutions and a reduction of cultural heterogeneity to transform its economic progress. 19 pp., CONTACT: National Center for Policy Analysis, 12655 N.

<h3>Defenders of Property Rights</h3>

<B>Defenders Moves Forward with an Aggressive Litigation Program</B><P>

Defenders has been engaged by the United Property Owners of Washington (UPOW) to serve as co-counsel in the case of United States v. Washington. At issue is an 1850s treaty between the then-territorial governor and sixteen Indian tribes regarding the harvesting of shellfish. Even though most of the tideland area of Washington is privately owned (it is one of only a few states with such private ownership) and has been tended and enhanced over the years by its owners, the tribes and the federal government believe that certain Indian tribes share the right to harvest the shellfish. In an interim order, a federal district judge awarded the tribes the ability to take half the harvest. The tribes and the government, however, are seeking a larger take of the shellfish and full access to the tidelands. UPOW has intervened in the hope of protecting their right of "exclusive possession and clear title" to their property.<P>

<b>Defenders Fights Charge of Hunter Harassment</B><P>

Defenders has also filed a complaint in a state court in Minnesota seeking just compensation on behalf of a property owner. In James F. Peternell v. State of Minnesota, the private property owner was criminally prosecuted for attempting to exclude state officials from his property. Mr. Peternell bought 160 acres of land in 1972, 140 of which are considered wetland. A 1984 state law designated the wetland area as a "protected water basin," making it "public waters." Although he had previously been told by the Department of Natural Resources that his land was still privately-owned, he was later indicted on charges of "hunter harassment" when he tried to remove uninvited hunters--including an undercover DNR official--from his land. While the criminal charges against Mr. Peternell were dismissed by a jury, a court did find that his land can now be considered public domain under the 1984 law.<P>

<B>Defenders Supports Rights of Hog Farmer</B><P>

In City of Chesapeake v. Earl Warren, Defenders represents a hog farmer in Virginia. The city officials have now decided that his hog farm constitutes a "public nuisance", even though his land has been used for over 120 years and he follows sound industry practices on his farm. At stake in this case is the extent to which local governments can characterize historically typical and productive uses of land as a "nuisance" (as the city has in this case by passage of an ordinance directed at his activities) and thereby destroy that use of land without incurring the constitutional duty to pay the owner just compensation for that taking. On September 8, 1995, the court rejected the government's request for a permanent injunction that would have shut down the hog farm and instead offered to work with the property owner in an attempt to remedy the situation short of closing down the farm. Another hearing has been set for December 7, 1995.<P>

<B>Defenders Challenges Gas Company</B><P>

In Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation v. Deana Wingfield Drain, Defenders is challenging in federal court the utility company's practice of unilaterally expanding its right-of-way from 8 inches to 50 feet without compensating property owners for that taking. In this case, Columbia Gas forced the property owners to move their mobile home and shed (both of which were anchored to cement foundations) out of the newly-claimed right-of-way, at their own expense. Moreover, the enforcement of the right-of-way has been selective; in fact, one home actually sits atop the gas line but those home owners have not been asked to move the house. Discovery is underway in the case.
On September 20, 1995, Defenders will be filing a petition for a writ of certiorari in the United States Supreme Court, asking the court to review the decision of the Oregon Supreme Court. At issue in the case, United Employer Benefit Corporation v. Department of Insurance and Finance (Oregon), is whether personal property is protected to the same degree as is land against uncompensated takings and also whether threats which have the effect of destroying an ongoing business trigger the duty of government to pay for the taking.
Defenders will also file a brief on behalf of itself and other co-amici curiae in the case of Stubblefield v. City of Sand Bernardino on September 20, 1995, in the United States Supreme Court. At issue in this case is whether government actions which were clearly arbitrary and designed to target a small developers project violate the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.

<h3>Institute for Justice</H3>

<B>Runstrom, et al. V. City of Kalamazoo</B><P>

On September 7, 1995, the Institute filed a constitutional challenge to the City of Kalamazoo's housing inspection law that allows government inspectors to enter apartments without tenant consent or a validly-executed search warrant. The Institute for Justice filed the lawsuit on behalf of 13 Kalamazoo apartment tenants. The case came to the attention of the Institute for Justice when landlord Jerry Speedy was brought up on criminal charges for refusing to provide access to rented apartments unless the tenants consented to the building code inspections.
The constitutional rule that the Institute for Justice seeks to establish in this lawsuit is: If government inspectors wish to enter tenants' homes, they must ask for and receive their explicit consent. If the tenants do not wish to grant inspectors access to their homes, the government must obtain a search warrant based on some reasonable suspicion (probable cause) that the housing code is being violated.<P>

<B>Teen Challenge of San Antonio Wins Battle Against Texas Commission on Alcohol and Drug Abuse (TCADA)</B><P>

The Institute represents Teen Challenge of San Antonio, in its effort to continue its faith-based drug and alcohol treatment program, which was threatened with the secular requirements imposed by the Texas Commission on Alcohol and Drug Abuse licensing requirements.
Teen Challenge, a thirty-five year old program with an excellent track record of success, believes the key to solving chemical dependency problems lies in the spiritual dimension of a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. It accepts no government funding for treatment and all participants come to this program voluntarily.
TCADA views addiction as a disease of the body that can be treated, but never cured. TCADA's secularized, disease-based model for addiction and treatment--and the regulations that implement this model--did not allow Teen Challenge to carry out its salvation, Christ-centered model of treatment. Based on this incompatibility, Teen Challenge objected to being forced to meet the licensing and regulatory requirements of TCADA. The Institute for Justice, working with the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, is providing legal representation to Teen Challenge in ongoing negotiations with Texas and is prepared for litigation if necessary.<P>

<B>Battle for Expanded Choice Continues in Milwaukee</B><P>

Despite substantial disruption as a result of the Wisconsin Supreme Court's injunction of the recently expanded school choice program, most students have received privately funded scholarships through Parents Acquiring Values in Education (PAVE) to allow them to enroll in their chosen private schools. This resulted from the generous contributions made by caring individuals, parents, schools, and the business and philanthropic communities.
Over the next month, the lawyers in this case will meet to determine whether there are factual issues in dispute. Assuming the Wisconsin Supreme Court does not remand the case to the trial court, the Court could (a) rule in favor of the IJ on all issues, (b) rule against the IJ, but decide that the religion clauses of the Wisconsin Constitution are the same as the First Amendment, (c) rule against the IJ, finding that the Wisconsin Constitution is more restrictive than the First Amendment, (d) rule against the IJ on the other grounds under the Wisconsin Constitution. Under the first two scenarios, an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court would be possible, but an appeal would be precluded under the third and fourth scenarios. The Institute was granted intervenor status on behalf of Parents for School Choice and eight individual families, and will continue to play an active role throughout the litigation.

<B>"Don't Worry-Be Happy" Feds Tell Local Sheriffs</B><P>

In response to a lawsuit by the Wyoming Sheriff's Association challenging the constitutionality of the Brady Act, the U.S. Government filed a motion to dismiss asserting that it will not enforce the law against sheriffs. Despite the clear provisions of the Brady Act, the U.S. Government filed a motion to dismiss asserting that it will not enforce the law against sheriffs. Despite the clear penalties, federal lawyers maintain that sheriffs have no reason to fear prosecution.

<B>Boston Taxi Medallion Fight Returns to State Court</B><P>

Nine years after beginning a seemingly quixotic struggle to drive his own taxi in Boston and four years after his precedent-setting victory in Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, Robert Lynch, represented by NELF, has returned to the Massachusetts courts in order to try to reap the fruits of his struggle.
Robert Lynch is a partially disable man who has supported himself for years by driving taxi cabs in Boston. Ten years ago, he tried to acquire a taxi "medallion", the legal right to operate his own cab, rather than just drive cabs owned by others. Since World War II, the number of Boston medallions had been fixed at 1525 and their price had risen over $50,000, far in excess of his resources. The resulting shortage of taxis led to higher fares and reduced taxi availability, particularly in minority and low income areas which are more dependent upon taxi service than other parts of the city.
Mr. Lynch went to the public library and found a 1934 law, never before use, which gave a state agency the power to require Boston to issue new medallions and he appealed to the agency. In 1990, it ordered Boston to issue hundreds of new medallions "immediately." The order was appealed by taxi owners to Massachusetts' Supreme Judicial Court, but Mr. Lynch, represented by NELF, prevailed in 1991.
Since then, NELF and Mr. Lynch have negotiated with Boston in an effort establish reasonable ground rules for issuance of the 300 new medallions called for by the agency's order on remand. Gradually, Boston hardened its position and finally decided that it could legally ignore the state agency order.
NELF has now filed a mandamus action on Mr. Lynch's behalf. While Mr. Lynch concedes that Boston has the right to establish reasonable rules as to who shall be permitted to operate taxis in the city, it cannot simply flout its legal obligation to issue new medallions. Issuing the new medallions is not only required to comply with the city's legal duty but also it will begin the opening of a rigid and inefficient system to competition and free enterprise, which will benefit the taxi-using public.<P>

<b>NELF Supports High-Tech Manufacturer</b><P>

The New England Legal Foundation has filed a friend of the court brief on behalf of the Associated Industries of Massachusetts, supporting Houghton-Mifflin Company's effort to retain its status as a "manufacturing" company for purposes of state tax law. The basic issue in the case is whether a state should use its tax law to encourage or discourage a business' effort to move away from traditional labor intensive "manufacturing" in the direction of more modern high-technology, knowledge-intensive operations.
For over thirty years, Massachusetts has classified Houghton-Mifflin Corporation, a nationally-known book publisher, as a "manufacturing corporation," which entitles it to a tax credit for new equipment purchases and other tax benefits. In 1991, the state Department of Revenue notified Houghton-Mifflin that this classification had been revoked, retroactive to 1986. The basis for that action was that Houghton-Mifflin no longer printed its textbooks in the state, having shifted that aspect of its business to independent contractors while retaining in Massachusetts its more intellectual activities including writing, editing, preparing art work, designing and preparing computer materials and compact discs.
Houghton-Mifflin appealed the Department's action. The state Appellate Tax Board ruled in Houghton-Mifflin's favor, holding that its operations in Massachusetts continued to meet the state's statutory tests for constituting "manufacturing" as well as the Department's own regulations on that subject. The Department appealed to Massachusetts' highest court, arguing that, as a matter of law, Houghton-Mifflin's operations could not constitute manufacturing.
NELF's amicus brief argued that the Board had been correct. When the legislature originally amended the state's tax laws to encourage "manufacturing", it had n o intention of binding business into a straightjacket irrevocably tied to then-current technology. Rather, its obvious goal was to use the tax laws creatively to encourage businesses to take actions that would benefit the wider community. In today's economy, Houghton-Mifflin's actions in shifting its operations in the direction of cleaner, high wage, high technology jobs are precisely the sort of positive transformation that Massachusetts should be encouraging.

<h3>Pacific Legal Foundation</h3>

<B>Bureaucratic Land Grab Averted</b><P>

State of California ex rel. State Lands Commission v. Superior Court (Lovelace). In a key victory for property rights, the California Supreme Court agreed with Pacific Legal Foundation arguments and thwarted a major land grab by the State Lands Commission. As a result, the private ownership, use, and enjoyment of properties along the banks of rivers, streams, or lake shores in the state have been preserved.
In California, as in all other states, new land that is formed by slow accretion to a shoreline or riverbank becomes the private property of the adjacent upland owner. Accretion is the gradual and imperceptible accumulation of land by natural causes. This process can occur either by the washing up of sand or soil from a body of water, such as the sea or a river, or by the gradual subsidence of water which leaves land uncovered. Thus, if a river gradually shifts its course by the accumulations of silt, sand, grave, and other sediment, and land is created where there was once only river bottom, the owner of the adjacent upland gains title to the newly formed land.
During the mid to late 1800s, hydraulic mining both enriched the economy of the state and wreaked havoc on the downstream reaches of the San Joaquin and Sacramento River watershed by depositing vast amounts of gravel, sand, and silt into the waterways. As this material worked its way downstream, it was deposited in the slower reaches of these waterways causing the river bottoms to gradually rise by many feet, creating dry land where there once was river bottom.
Richard Lovelace owns property which includes a 12-acre parcel that was created by accretion when the river bottom rose between 12 and 15 feet during the heyday of California's hydraulic gold mining era. The State Lands Commission tried to snatch that property from Mr. Lovelace on the theory that the accretion was the result of "artificial" rather than natural causes.
The California Supreme Court agreed with PLF's arguments and held that title to land formed in the last century as a partial result of the sediment washed downstream by hydraulic mining would be determined according to the rule of accretion. That is, if it was deposited slowly and imperceptibly over time, title would inure to the adjacent upland riparian owner onto whose land the accretion occurs. Had the state bureaucracy gotten its way, the settled status of thousand of acres in California would have been destroyed.<P>

<b>Defending Voters' Right to Cut Back Government Spending</b><P>

Atiyeh v. Oregon. In this case, PLF is defending Ballot Measure 8, enacted by Oregon voters to roll back lavish pension plans for state workers.
Oregon law has long required that public employees contribute 6% of their gross pay toward their retirement pension plan. However, in 1979, the state Legislature enacted a Pension Pick-Up Law requiring the government employer (i.e., the taxpayers) to "pick up" the 6% tab. Thus, since 1979 most Oregon government workers have not actually contributed to their annual pension premiums, although "on paper" they have been credited with making a 6% contribution! Under the Pension Pick-Up Law, Oregon taxpayers not only bear the full pension cost for public employees, but also guarantee a minimum 8% return on pension investments. In addition, pension benefits can be increased by unused sick leave.
Recognizing that this generous pension plan was not akin to most private sector pension plans, Oregon voters enacted Ballot Measure 8. A major objective of this initiative is to reverse the 1979 Pick-Up Law by amending the Oregon Constitution to require public employees to contribute 6% of their salary toward their pension plan. To ensure that taxpayers no longer pick up the 6% tab, Measure 8 prohibits government employers from contracting to relieve public employees of their contribution duty or to increase their salaries or benefits as an offset. Among other restrictions, Measure 8 also bars government contracts from guaranteeing the interest rate on public pensions funds.
The Pacific Legal Foundation filed a friend of the court brief in the Oregon Supreme Court opposing a lawsuit seeking to block Ballot Measure 8. The suit does not challenge the substance of the measure, but the legality of the whole initiative process as applied to Measure 8.

<h3>Washington Legal Foundation</h3>

<B>Michigan Supported in Motor Voter Litigation</B><P>

Joined by three Members of the Michigan delegation to Congress (Representatives Richard R. Chrysler, Nick Smith, and Fred Upton), the Washington Legal Foundation filed an amici curiae brief in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan in support of Michigan's position in ACORN v. Miller, a suit brought to force the state to carry out the unfunded mandates in the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (the "motor voter" law). WLF argued that the Act is not within the power of Congress to determine the "Times, Places and Manner of holding elections for Senators and Representatives." Among other mandates, the Act requires a state to offer assistance in completing a voter registration form to all clientele visiting welfare and unemployment agencies. <P>

<b>Supreme Court Urged To Limit Abusive Class Action Suits</B><P>

In a brief filed in the Supreme Court in Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. v. Epstein, WLF argued that a corporation should not have to defend against more than one class action suit based on alleged violations of securities law where the different lawsuits arise from the same transaction. When a corporation settles with one group of plaintiffs who purport to represent shareholders, another group of plaintiffs should not be permitted to extort additional settlement funds by claiming to represent the same shareholders, WLF argued.<P>

<b>Limits On Judicial Campaign Contributions Proposed</B><P>
WLF filed a petition with California Bar authorities recommending that trial lawyers be prohibited from making judicial campaign contributions. Studies cited by WLF show that in California and elsewhere, plaintiffs' trial lawyers have contributed enormous amounts to judges before whom they practice, creating the impression that justice can be bought. Fifteen top California trial lawyers gave almost $1 million to candidates for judicial office.<P>

<B>FDA Requested To Ease Rules on Direct-to-Consumer Ads</B><P>
A citizen petition filed by WLF with the Food and Drug Administration urged the agency to adopt a policy recognizing that direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription drugs can play a helpful role in providing consumers with truthful information about prescription drugs and also recognizing that truthful, non-misleading advertising of prescription drugs receives significant protection under the First Amendment. WLF recommended that the agency replace its current case-by-case review of such advertising with rules setting out "a very limited, very clearly-defined" set of improper advertising practices, giving manufacturers fair notice of what advertising is impermissible.

<html><title>No Free Lunch for Lobbyists -- Heritage</title>
<center><img src="/heritage/thf_log2.gif"></center>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center><h2>September Insider : No Free Lunch for Lobbyists</h2><br></center>
  by Charles P. Griffin, Deputy House Liaison at the Heritage Foundation<p><hr><P>

The best-kept "dirty little secret" in Washington these days may be the millions of taxpayer dollars that are siphoned off each year to fund welfare for lobbyists. Over the past forty years, Congress has helped create a vast patronage network of organizations that enjoy tax-preferred status, receive federal funds, and engage in legislative or political advocacy.<P>
Almost every interest in America from agriculture to zoology has one or more organizations receiving government funding. Recipients range from the American Association of Retired Persons, which received over $73 million in a one-year period, to the American Bar Association, which received $2.2 million. This subsidy forces the taxpayer to foot the bill for a range of ideologically driven organizations.<P>
The coercive power of the federal government should not be used to force taxpayers to finance organizations which lobby Congress or other government entities.Taxpayer funding of advocacy organizations is wrong fiscally, morally, and logically. It is fiscally irresponsible to spend federal revenues on activities that provide no meaningful return to the American people. It is morally wrong for the government to take sides in any public policy debate by assisting the advocacy activities of an elite few. And it is logically wrong for the government to fund activities that often result in lobbying for increased federal expenditures. <P>
Every federal dollar frees private resources to be spent on political, lobbying, and other advocacy activities. Moreover, federal funds make the organization appear to be a larger force in the political arena than it would if it were totally reliant upon private contributions. For example, the National Council of Senior Citizens receives more than $70 million 96 percent of its funding from the federal government. While enjoying a generous federal subsidy, this proponent of big government actively engages in a broad range of overtly partisan political activity.<P>  
Unfortunately, the NCSC is but one of many advocacy organizations receiving federal funds. The National Trust for Historic Preservation received approximately $7 million from the federal government in FY 1994, 22 percent of its budget. In addition to opposing economic development nationwide, the Trust recently sent a letter to members of Congress urging them to "vote no" on a possible amendment in the House to reduce their taxpayer subsidy. It is no wonder that this nation has a multi-trillion dollar debt when federally-funded organizations can so blatantly lobby Congress for more money.<P>
Existing auditing of federal grants by the government does not provide the level of scrutiny needed to root out abuse. The following should be essential parts of any congressional efforts to curb current abuses:<P>
To solve this problem, no advocacy organization that receives federal funds should be permitted to engage in anything but incidental lobbying activities, except on issues directly related to its tax status. The consequences for violating the prohibition on federally subsidized lobbying must be sufficient to discourage organizations from violating the standards. Under no circumstances should any organization that willingly and knowingly violates the prohibitions receive further federal funding.<P>
In addition, to shed more light on this "dirty little secret," witnesses testifying before Congress should be required to divulge in their oral and written testimonies whether they receive federal funds and, if so, for what purpose and in what amount. This will permit committees to view the testimony in an appropriate light<P>.
It's time for this Congress to end welfare for lobbyists. Taxpayers should no longer be forced to subsidize political activity with which they disagree. Thomas Jefferson anticipated this debate over two hundred years ago when he correctly stated, "To compel a man to furnish funds for the propagation of ideas he disbelieves and abhors is sinful and tyrannical."<P>
Mr. Jefferson must be spinning in his grave.<P>

<b>NATO's Role in European Stability</B>,edited by Stephen A. Cambone
<br>The Center for
Strategic & International Studies<p>

The Center for Strategic
and International Studies addresses the current political debate
over the redefinition and transformation of NATO, which dates
back to the very beginnings of the post-Cold War era. The report
examines the question of how to restructure the transatlantic
partnership in light of the recent discussions surrounding the
future membership of Eastern European nations into NATO. The report
also considers how NATO should have responded to the situation
in Bosnia. CSIS compiles the opinions of various academics and
foreign policy experts on the rightful course for NATO during
its transformation period. Walter Slocombe, US undersecretary
of defense for policy, lists four basic principles that must be
kept in mind during NATO's expansion: &quot;First, NATO is an
effective alliance, not a system of paper guarantees. Second,
it is an alliance of free nations and is committed to the principles
of liberty. Third, it works by consensus. Fourth, NATO is ultimately
a military organization.&quot; 67 pp. CONTACT: The Center for

<b>The
B-2 Bomber: Failure to Buy More Could Compromise Security in the
Next Century</B>, by Jim Courter and Loren Thompson
<br>Alexis de Tocqueville
Institution<p>The Alexis de Tocqueville Institution presents the
case for why the production of the B-2 bomber, popularly know
as the stealth bomber, should not be curtailed as it is essential
to the maintenance of US security. The report warns against terminating
the production of the B-2 after the government has committed over
$20 billion to its development since the last decade of the Cold
War. The study concludes that it would be more cost effective
to continue the production of the bomber, despite its high price
tag, because the cost of every available alternative that can
achieve future military objectives is considerably higher. Courter
and Thompson also espouse the belief that possession of the B2
is critical to US security in light of the trend towards the globalization
of advanced technologies; this suggests that the present generation
of US aircraft will be outdated by early next century. 53 pp.

<b>From
Shadows to Substance: an Action Plan for Transatlantic Defense
Cooperation</b><br>The Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies<p>

The
Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies issues a conference
report from their February 1995 conference held to discuss the
prospects for transatlantic defense cooperation in today's political
environment. Policy makers, industrialists, and academics met
to investigate the possibilities of establishing cooperative measures
between the US and Europe in the areas of military research, development,
and production. In this report, CSIS attests to the positive gains
made toward establishing transatlantic partnerships for future
US defense programs, to enable more programs to come to fruition.
The conference did conclude, however, leaving some ambiguity:&quot;the
interoperability argument for transatlantic defense cooperation
has shifted from enabling allied forces to meet a possible joint
threat in a cohesive and efficient manner to enabling alliance
members to undertake multinational operations outside NATO's area.&quot;

<b>The Purposes of Russian Aid: Supporting Democratic
Capitalism</b>, by Ariel Cohen
<br><a href="/heritage/library/categories/forpol/bg1041.html">Backgrounder No. 1041</a>, The Heritage
Foundation<p>

Ariel Cohen, a Salvatori Fellow in Russian and Eurasian
Studies at The Heritage Foundation, advocates re-examining the
aid that the US plans to give to Russia and the Newly Independent
States in FY 1996 and in FY 1997 which will be up for a vote in
the Senate shortly. Cohen points out that US-Russian cooperation
is ebbing due to the following: Russia's intervention in Chechnya,
Moscow's refusal to end the sale of nuclear reactors to Iran,
and the lack of free-market reforms that have been enacted, since
Gorbachev's perestroika began ten years ago. The author recommends
that the Senate preface the allocation of the aid based upon six
contingencies: &quot;1) demand that the Administration suspend
negotiations to reschedule the Russian and Soviet debt to Western
creditors if the proposed sale of nuclear reactors to Iran is
completed; 2) condition US support for IMF credits to the Russian
government on a cease-fire in Chechnya; 3) create an independent
board to manage aid to Russia and the NIS; 4) reprogram $225 million
to develop democracy in Russia and the NIS by abolishing the Commodities
Import Program and the Russian Officer Resettlement Program; 5)
make democratic development a top priority; 6) target grants directly
to democratic institutions in Russia and the NIS.&quot; 13 pp.

<b>The United States and Future Bosnias</B>,
Jonathan G. Clarke
<br>Foreign Policy Briefing No. 36, Cato Institute<p>
Foreign
policy studies research fellow Jonathan Clarke of the Cato Institute
equates the importance of US foreign policy towards Bosnia as
setting the precedent for future policy towards other Eastern
European nations where conflict is erupting. Thus, according to
the author, the manner in which the US proceeds is paramount.
The author advocates a policy of nonintervention towards Bosnia
based on three main arguments: 1) the war in Bosnia is an intracommunal
dispute and is not an aberration from past, present, or future
conflicts that comprise Europe's history; 2) unlike Nazi Germany
and the Soviet Union, conflicts such as Bosnia do not pose a threat
to US security; 3) intracommunal conflicts make it difficult for
the US to distinguish between the aggressor and the victim. Clarke
concludes that &quot;failure to draw the appropriate lessons from
the Bosnian debacle will cause the United States to end up repeating
the same mistakes elsewhere in Europe.&quot; 12 pp. CONTACT: The

<b>More Military Bases Need to be Closed</b>, Baker Spring
<br><a href="/heritage/library/catagories/natsec/bg1042.html">Backgrounder
No. 1042, The Heritage Foundation</a><p>
Baker Springs, a senior policy
analyst at The Heritage Foundation, attests that more base closings
are still needed despite the latest round of base closing, which
insufficiently reduced the size of military forces, personnel,
and budgets down to the size recommended by the Defense Base Closure
and Realignment Commission. The author explains that insufficient
base closings pose a very grave threat to US security; moneys
spent maintaining excessive bases only detract from vital military
readiness and modernization programs. Thus, the author advocates
extending the base closure process for another two rounds to ensure
that base infrastructure, which has only been reduced by 15 percent
since 1985, approaches the 25 percent cuts in military personnel
during the same time period. The paper also recommends that additional
oversight be made in any upcoming base closings so that the procedure
does not become politicized by the upcoming presidential race;
the electoral map and presidential politics should not influence
which bases are selected to be closed. 8 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis,

<b>Venezuela:
The Quiet Crisis Deepens</b>, by Mark Falcoff
<br>Latin American Outlook,
American Enterprise Institute
<p>Venezuela has long since passed its
days of economic prosperity that it enjoyed in the 1960s and 70s.
Mark Falcoff, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute,
outlines the causes of  this collapse and the political, social,
and economic policies that continue to sabotage efforts to put
Venezuela back on track. The author reveals that President Caldera
has supported dangerous economic reforms that include the following:
1) price controls that will increase shortages of basic foodstuffs
and articles on necessity; 2) foreign exchange controls that hurt
businesses by creating shortages of needed raw materials and parts;
3) and finally, a deliberate effort to stall any effort that move
towards privatization. These policies do not bode well for the
Venezuelan economic crisis that continues to worsen, fostering
even more support for a military coup that could truncate Caldera's
presidency. 4 pp. Contact: American Enterprise Institute, 1150

<b>How to
Close Down the Department of Transportation</b>, by Ronald D. Utt
and Wendell Cox
<br><a href="/heritage/library/catagories/bugettax/bg1048.html">Backgrounder No. 1048, The Heritage Foundation</a>
<P>
Ronald
Utt, visiting Heritage Fellow, and Wendell Cox, director of state
policy and legislation for the American Legislative Exchange Council,
present the process through which the Department of Transportation,
created in 1966, has grown into the enormously inefficient bureaucracy
that exists today. Utt and Cox state that this fiscal year's budget
allocates $39 billion to the DOT, with nearly $19 billion going
to highways. According to this study, much of the department's
spending is derived from the Highway Trust Fund, which is replenished
by the federal fuel tax paid by motorists at the gas pump, and
the Aviation Trust Fund, financed largely by a passenger ticket
tax and several lesser aviation taxes. Utt and Cox demonstrate
that the DOT has remained mostly unchanged in its structure and
purpose since 1966; however both the Congress and the White House
now agree that major reform is necessary. Even modest reform proposals
have met opposition with House Republicans, but the Senate Republicans
have proven their commitment to fundamental reform, urging greater
privatization and federalism in transportation issues. This report
argues that the reforms emerging from conference are not enough,
further reforms in the following areas are necessary: surface
transportation; the end of federal mandates which have inflated
state transportation costs and deterred the development of creative,
low-cost transportation solutions; and urban mass transit. This
paper suggest the elimination of the Federal Transit Administration;
privatizing Amtrak; privatization of air traffic control and the
devolution of federal control to the states; and the transfer
of Coast Guard responsibilities to the Department of Justice.

<b>Five Hundred LifeSaving Interventions
and Their Cost Effectiveness</b>, by Tammy O. Tengs, Miriam E. Adams,
Joseph S. Pliskin, Dana Gelb Safran, Joanna E. Siegel, Milton
C. Weinstein, and John D. Graham<br>
Risk Analysis Vol. 15 No. 3, Harvard
Center for Risk Analysis<p>
The team of experts who produced this
important paper gathered information on the cost-effectiveness
of life-saving interventions in the United States from publicly
available economic analyses. &quot;Life-saving interventions&quot;
were defined as any behavioral and/or technological strategies
that reduce the possibility of premature death among a specified
target population. This paper defines cost effectiveness as the
net resource costs of an intervention per year of life saved.
The 587 interventions identified in this work ranged from those
that saved more resources than they cost, to those costing more
than $10 billion per year of life saved. This paper finds the
median intervention costs $42,000 per lifeyear saved; the median
medical intervention costs $19,000 per life-year saved, the median
injury -eduction costs $48,000 per life-year, and toxin control
costs $2,800,000 per life-year saved. 21 pp. CONTACT: The Harvard

<b>Time to Reopen the Clean Air Act: Clearing Away the
Regulatory Smog</b>, by K.H. Jones and Jonathan Adler<br>
Policy Analysis
No. 233, Cato Institute<p>
K.H. Jones, president of Zephyr Consulting
Company, and Jonathan Adler, associate director of environmental
studies at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, maintain that
the national policy on the control of urban smog is misguided
because it fails to account for current pollution trends and is
based on the anomalous meteorological conditions of 1988. This
misguided policy, according to this paper, has led to &quot;regulatory
overkill&quot; by the Environmental Protection Agency. Jones and
Adler state that this particularly affects the Ozone Transport
Region, the twelve states from Virginia to Maine, imposing emissary
control strategies that are not only unnecessary, ineffective,
and expensive, but are also scientifically insupportable. The
authors write, &quot;control for control's sake pollution control
strategies pursued by the EPA and the OTC are largely inappropriate
because they are neither costeffective nor equitable means of
achieving emissions reductions, even should such reductions be
necessary.&quot; The authors conclude that legislative action
is necessary to alleviate unneeded and costly regulatory mandates.

<b>Utility Regulation: Challenge and Response</b><br>
Readings
42, Institute of Economic Affairs and the London Business School<p>
Each
year the Institute of Economic Affairs, in conjunction with the
London Business School, publishes this volume of readings in order
to provide its readers with a current assessment of the state
of utility regulation. This year's edition presents the regulators
themselves discussing the problems that they, and their utilities,
face; as well as analysis of these discussions by leading commentators.
Contributors include Sir Bryan Carsberg, Professor Stephen Littlechild,
and Clare Spottiswoode. This work attempts to prove that privatization
and increased competition in the utilities industry would help
to solve many of the utilities current problems, as well as reducing
the exposure of these industries to the vagaries of shortterm
Ministerial intervention. 139 pp. CONTACT: Institute of Economic

<b>A Guide to Crafting a Tax Package for the Budget Resolution</b>,
by Angela Antonelli, John Barry, Bill Beach, Joe Cobb, Scott Hodge,
and Daniel J. Mitchell<br>Backgrounder No. 1043, The Heritage Foundation<p>

This
paper, prepared by the staff of the Roe Institute for Economic
Policy Studies at The Heritage Foundation, recommends a substantial
package of tax relief to help families with children and to stimulate
economic growth as the House Ways and Means Committee and Senate
Finance Committee fill in the details of the $245 billion tax
relief plan. The Roe Institute staff suggests using the $354 billion
House plan as a menu from which to craft a tax relief package,
including such items as: a $500 per child tax credit; a reduction
of the capital gains tax; and an IRAPlus plan. This paper demonstrates
why both tax and spending reductions are necessary to effectively
move control of spending out of Washington and into the hands
of ordinary citizens. 13 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage

<b>Why

Hudson Briefing Paper
No. 178, Hudson Institute<p>

Alan Reynolds, the Hudson Institute's
director of economic research, has adapted his testimony before
the House Republican Joint Economic Committee and House Republican
Policy Committee Briefing on the Dollar to produce this paper.
Reynolds gives a &quot;graphic&quot; demonstration of how the
federal government's policies are driving the US economy toward
a new boat of stagflation. This paper compares the state of the
current economy with the conditions of 197475, 197982, and 199091.
Current actions by the federal government point towards stagflations:
America's increasingly hostile tax climate for domestic savings
and foreign investment. Reynolds suggests that the decline of
the dollar is not the result of budget deficit or the Federal
Reserve's interest rate; but that the steady decline may be halted
with appropriate tax and monetary policies, including tax incentives
for savings and investments. 8 pp. CONTACT: Hudson Institute,

This paper represents the testimony
of Murray Weidenbaum, chairman of the Center for the Study of
American Business, before the US House of Representatives Committee
on Commerce. Weidenbaum endorses pending legislative proposals
to abolish the Department of Commerce, stressing that only a favored
few receive the special benefits bestowed by the Commerce Department,
while millions of other businesses of all sizes pay the taxes
that finance the department. Weidenbaum states, &quot;The current
system is a classic example of the government's traditional tendency
to rob (or at least tax) Peter to pay Paul.&quot; The author recommends
eliminating the Technology Administration, the National Telecommunications

rate of state tax collections relative to personal income growth
varies substantially from state to state. The seven tables in

John Tottie, policy analyst at Citizens

mood of the country, is considering imposing a $550 millionayear
tax on airline passengers and airborne cargo transportation. According
to Tottie, this 4.3 cents per gallon jet fuel tax is scheduled
to take effect October 1 of this year. The National Airline Commission
of 1993 stated, &quot;At a time when the United States is looking
for ways to strengthen the airline industry, an additional tax
seems illadvised.&quot; Tottie concludes that this tax, which
is equivalent to the compensation of 10,000 airline employees,
would destroy jobs, hurt airline passengers, and slow the overall

<p><b>Scale Back
the Earned Income Tax Credit</b>, by Marvin H. Kosters<br>
On the Issues
No. 28, American Enterprise Institute<p>
Marvin Kosters, resident
scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, explains that, despite
the fact that the earned income tax credit (EITC) was designed
to help the working poor, the EITC has faced increased scrutiny
from both sides of the aisle as the Congress works to balance
the budget. Kosters suggests that, while a review is certainly
in order, a more comprehensive assessment of the EITC is needed.
Kosters argues that the program has not achieved the success its
supporters claim and that, instead of encouraging work, the EITC
discourages work for too many people who are too far up the income
ladder. 4 pp. CONTACT: American Enterprise Institute, 1150 17th

Christopher Good, a Ph.D. candidate at Harvard University,
seeks to explain the current and prospective state of Canada's
finances and how these finances affect Canada's &quot;public sector
economic maladies.&quot; The author uses a technique called generational
accounting to look at the future stream of government taxes, transfers,
and expenditures. The findings suggest that Canada's current fiscal
policies are unsustainable. Good explains why the Canadian government
sector, with enormously higher unfunded future liabilities is
overspending at a vastly greater rate than the US. The paper recommends
a &quot;freeze and growth through productivity&quot; policy, which
means that at each age, an individual's taxes are increased at
the rate of productivity, while his or her transfers and government
expenditures remain constant in real terms. 74 pp. CONTACT: The

<b>A Guide to Medicare Reform Proposals</b>,
by John C. Liu<br>
<a href="/library/categories/healthwel/fyi57.html">F.Y.I. No. 57, The Heritage Foundation</a><P>
Heritage policy
analyst John Liu describes the need for action in Medicare when
Congress returns from its summer recess. Liu writes, &quot;To
avoid the collapse of program, Congress has only two choices:
1) Do not change significantly the way Medicare is run by the
government, and assure future new revenues through higher payroll
taxes and other taxes or by diverting money from other programs;
or 2) Fundamentally change the way Medicare is run so that benefits
are delivered more efficiently, thereby avoiding future tax increases
or a diversion of money from other programs. This approach would
aim to slow the rate at which costs are anticipated to grow. This
paper assesses the proposals from the Clinton administration,
Brookings Institution, Heritage Foundation, National Center for
Policy Analysis, the National Committee to Preserve Social Security
and Medicare, United Seniors Association, and major organizations
representing health care providers. Liu presents the approach
of the various groups' proposals, and shows how they address the
reforms necessary to change Medicare. 21 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis,

<b>Why

Patrick Fagan<br>
<a href="/library/catagories/healthwel/bg1046.html">Backgrounder No. 1027, The Heritage Foundation</a><p>
Patrick
Fagan, the William H.G. Fitzgerald Senior Fellow in Family and
Cultural Issues at The Heritage Foundation, argues that adoption
must be part of any plan to reform welfare. Fagan cites statistics
which show outofwedlock births reaching nearly 40 percent by the
year 2000 and 50 percent by the year 2012, and he questions why,
out of the 500,000 children in the foster care system, only 50,000
were cleared for adoption each year. Fagan suggests that adoption
addresses many of the current problems with the welfare system:
unwed mothers, children in abusive homes, children in foster care,
and costs to the state and federal governments. Fagan argues,
&quot;Adoption increases the emotional, physical, and cognitive
capacities of the children who are adopted. It improves the life
chances of the biological mother. It saves vast amounts of money
for the taxpayer. It brings much happiness to the adopting parents.
It is good for all involved. Adoption works.&quot; 30 pp. CONTACT:

<b>In Their

Tottie<br>
Issues and Answers, Citizens for a Sound Economy<P>
John Tottie,
a policy analyst for Citizens for a Sound Economy, observes that
the proposed elimination of the Department of Energy has become
a much discussed topic in Washington. Criticism of the department
is widespread, but, as the author reveals in this paper, some
of the most damning criticism comes from the Department of Energy
itself. Tottie has pulled together a selection of recent statements

<b>Should
We Worry About Ozone</b>, by Jane S. Shaw and Richard L. Stroup<BR>
Policy
Report No. 191, National Center for Policy Analysis<P>Jane Shaw and
Richard Stroup, senior associates with the Political Economy Research
Center, challenge the theory held by some scientists that the
depletion of stratospheric ozone is substantial and will grow
to alarming levels unless the use of CFCs and some related chemical
compounds is eliminated. The authors argue that the theory of
largescale depletion caused by human use of these chemicals is
not yet supported by solid scientific evidence. This paper presents
five areas of unresolved issues regarding the ozone: 1) it is
not clear that stratospheric ozone is being significantly depleted
worldwide, or that any depletion that may have occurred is permanent;
2) if the ozone layer is being depleted, it is not clear that
CFCs are the major cause or that reducing their use now will stop
or even slow depletion; 3) it appears that the &quot;ozone hole&quot;
above Antarctica is caused by unique conditions, and it is uncertain
whether additional or reduced chlorine from CFCs would affected
it; 4) even if ozone depletion does occur, there is no reliable
evidence that it will represent a grave threat to living things
on earth; and 5) the cost of eliminating CFCs for refrigeration
and cooling are higher than most people realize, with estimates
reaching nearly $100 billion over the next 10 years in the United
States alone. The authors conclude that the Montreal Protocol
banning CFCs should be changed to make the phaseout more gradual,
and the costs (including such social costs as the loss of safety)
of halting CFC production should be weighed against the small
and uncertain benefits. 21 pp. CONTACT: National Center for Policy

<B>Progressive Environmentalism: Principles for Regulatory
Reform</b>, by Kent Jeffries<BR>Policy Report No. 194, National Center
for Policy Analysis<P>

National Center for Policy Analysis senior
fellow Kent Jeffries suggests that any regulatory reform bill
approved by Congress will only be a first step toward removing
governmental abuses without sacrificing overall environmental
quality. Jeffries argues that Congress must still reauthorize
or review a host of environmental programs individually, including
Superfund, pesticide regulations, the Endangered Species Act,
the Clean Water Act, and the Clean Air Act. This paper recommends
three guiding principles with which to examine these programs:
the federalism rule, which requires regulatory decisions to be
made by the smallest possible government entity; the costbenefit
rule, which considers whether the costs of a proposed regulation
reasonably reflect it benefits; and the compensation rule, under
which property owners are compensated for their losses if property
rights are taken or diminished by a regulation. Jeffries writes,
&quot;The regulatory reform bill is important, but if Congress
is to make the reform truly meaningful, it must define a role
for government in environmental regulation that gives people the
right incentives, that protects property rights, and that spends
the public money wisely.&quot; 44 pp. CONTACT: National Center

<B>Beyond the Grazing Fee: An Agenda for
Rangeland Reform</b>, by Karl Hess Jr. and Jerry L. Holecheck<BR>Policy
Analysis No. 234, Cato Institute<P>
Karl Hess, Cato senior fellow
in environmental studies, and Jerry Holecheck, professor of rangeland
studies at New Mexico State University, argue that the results
of more than a century of grazing on public land are testimony
to the failure of landuse socialism. This paper asserts that taxpayers
have paid for federally supervised and subsidized grazing, and
ranchers, the intended beneficiaries, have gained little except
debt, insecurity, and mountains of regulations, while environmental
quality has suffered. Hess and Holecheck address Interior Secretary
Bruce Babbitt's plan, arguing that &quot;it ignores the institutional
impediments that have made overgrazing and land abuse official
programs of the federal government, and it leaves unchanged the
federal policies that discourage rancher stewardship and pay stockmen
to overgraze and reward them for poor management practices.&quot;
This article presents four methods of reform: 1) placing the fiscal
burden of maintaining these lands on the ranchers; 2) opening
access to these lands for purposes other than grazing livestock;
3) decentralizing control over federal lands in selected areas
on a trial basis; and 4) extending the local control and opening
debate on partial or full divestiture of public rangelands. 27

<B>Securities Law Reform:
A Half Step in the Right Direction</b>, by William H. Lash III<br>
Contemporary
Issues No. 73, Center for the Study of American Business<P>
William
Lash, adjunct fellow at the Center for the Study of American Business,
finds that Congress, fearing an &quot;economic apocalypse where
millions of fleeced investors withdraw from securities markets
that fail to adequately protect them&quot; is reluctant to pass
pending legislation that would provide some protection to companies
facing groundless securities litigation. Lash proposes six aspects
of reform: 1) institute a loser pays all court cost provision;
2) require a meaningful investment by plaintiffs in strike suits;
3) require specific allegations of actual fraud or recklessness;
4) abolish RICO liability for securities suits; 5) limit the number
of lawsuits that may be brought by professional plaintiffs to
five cases in a three year period; and 6) require the Securities
and Exchange Commission to adopt rules providing a &quot;safe
harbor&quot; for corporations making positive, forwardlooking
statements in their corporate reports, so that companies are not
forces to play down bright prospects to investors simply to protect
the firm from possible frivolous securities lawsuits. Lash concludes
that the constant specter of groundless securities litigation
deters many worthy individuals from joining corporate boards and
wastes corporate resources while rewarding a handful of unscrupulous
attorneys. 20 pp. CONTACT: Center for the Study of American Business,

as the initial incongruity of an antidemocratic institution like
an unelected, lifetenured judiciary having the power to invalidate
the actions of elected officials. Jipping maintains that judicial
review seems &quot;fundamentally inconsistent with republican
government under a written constitution. The solution to this
dilemma, the only way in which judicial review retains its legitimacy
and remains consistent with the political theory underlying our
form of government, lies in how judicial review is conducted.&quot;

<B>The
1995 Crime Bill: Is the GOP the Party of Liberty and Limited Government?</b>,
by Jarett B. Decker<BR>
Policy Analysis No. 229, Cato Institute<P>
Jarett
Decker, a Minnesota attorney, accuses the new Republican Congress
of fighting crime by expanding federal power, just like past Democratic
Congresses. Decker argues that, despite the April 26 Supreme Court
ruling on the Lopez case, the 1995 GOP crime bill continue the
trends of recent years by making every local crime a federal crime.
According to this paper, federal prosecutors would be given even
more power under the GOP crime bills, while the rights of defendants
and the powers of judges would be curtailed. The authors demonstrates
that &quot;both the House and Senate bills give a green light
to government lawlessness,&quot; weakening constitutional protections
against invasions of private homes, raids on businesses, and detentions
of citizens in the course of criminal investigations. Decker concludes
that the 1995 crime bills are a step in the wrong direction, further
removing the US from constitutional checks and balances toward
a regime of unchecked power. 33 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000

<B>Orphanages:
Did They Throttle the Children in Their Care?</B>, by Richard B. McKenzie<BR>
Center

Economist Richard McKenzie presents
his preliminary findings from a survey of several hundred former
orphans, all of whom are now middleaged or older. Despite the
claims of child care professionals who condemn orphanages, the
survey found that when compared to their counterparts in the general
population, the orphans have: a lower divorce rate; a higher level
of education; a higher mean income; a far lower unemployment rate;
a far lower poverty rate; a minuscule rate of reliance on public
assistance; a minuscule arrest rate; a substantially lower rate
of mental and emotional disorders; and a higher rate of participation
in elections. McKenzie also reports that the majority of orphans
state that they prefer the way they grew up to the way they would
have grown up in foster care or in their own families. The author
contrasts the success of the orphans with the lowered expectations
of child care professionals for those growing up in orphanages.

<b>Cornell Professor
Sues Over Harassment Conviction</b><br>
The Center for Individual Rights
has filed a lawsuit against Cornell University on behalf of Professor
James B. Maas.  The lawsuit demands $1.5 million in damages for
Cornell's actions in finding Maas guilty of alleged &quot;sexual
harassment.&quot;<p>
Jim Maas, a professor of psychology, is one of
Cornell's most prominent faculty members.  He has a record of
31 years of distinguished service to the Cornell community.<P>
The
lawsuit, filed today in Tompkins County Supreme Court, demands
redress for a yearlong, ruinous witch hunt against Maas.  In a
proceeding over sexual harassment charges filed by former students
in May 1994, Maas was convicted as a &quot;sexual harasser&quot;
on stale and unproven charges; was subjected to an adjudicatory
&quot;process&quot; that was administered by fanatical faculty
members devoid of even the most basic elements of procedural fairness;
was forced to watch helplessly as unsubstantiated rumors and halftruths
were peddled to the local, national, and international press,
besmirching his reputation and severely damaging his ability to
function as a teacher and a scholar; and was ignored by Cornell's
feckless administrators when he protested the egregious violations
of Cornell's established procedures and of the confidentiality
rules that were supposed to govern the proceedings in his case.<P>

<b>Oral
Arguments Made in Hopwood v. State of Texas</b><br>
On Tuesday, August
8, the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit heard oral arguments
in the case of Hopwood v. State of Texas.  The case was brought
by Cheryl Hopwood and three other unsuccessful applicants for
admission to the University of Texas Law School.  The plaintiffs,
who are white, claim that the law school discriminated against
them by maintaining a racebased admissions system that was intentionally
biased in favor of black and Mexican American applicants.<P>
The case
is an appeal from a decision handed down by US District Court
Judge Sam Sparks in August 1994.  The judge found that the Law
School had indeed operated a racially discriminatory admission
system in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection
clause, noting that the school had maintained separate admissions
committees to evaluate applications from members of different
racial groups.  The judge also observed that blacks and MexicanAmericans
were presumptively admitted with test scores and college grade
point averages lower than those set for the presumptive rejection
of whites.<P>
Nevertheless, Judge Sparks refused to order the plaintiffs'
admission to the law school because they failed to prove that
they would have been admitted except for the unconstitutional
program.  Moreover, the judge refused to award damages of more
than one dollar, finding that the law school had acted in &quot;good
faith&quot; when it violated the plaintiffs' rights.  And because
the judge found the law school's admission program no longer to
be in violation of the equal protection clausebecause it had discarded
the segregated admission tracks and separate admissions committees
by the time the case went to trialhe refused to order any change
in the school's admissions procedures.<P>
The law school, however,
has never disavowed the use of race as a factor in its admissions
process; indeed, it continues to treat an applicant's status as
black or MexicanAmerican as a &quot;plus.&quot;  Such preference
is given automatically, without regard to the applicant's socioeconomic
background, and to both Texas residents and nonresidents.<P>
During
the oral argument, the plaintiffs asked the Fifth Circuit to order
the law school to offer them admission.  In addition, the plaintiffs
asked the appellate court to remand the case so that they may
seek an award of nontrivial monetary damages.  Most significantly,
however, the appeal asks that the law school be prevented from
using race as it currently does as a criterion in student admissions.
 In this respect, the case presents the Court of Appeals with
an opportunity to clarify the meaning of University of California
Regents v. Bakke, a 1978 Supreme Court ruling having to do with
the constitutionality of racebased admissions procedures at a
statesupported medical college.<P>

<b>Institute Files Amicus Opposing Civil Forfeiture<br></b>
The
Institute filed an amicus in Bennis v. State of Michigan, fighting
the government's ability to forfeit the property of wholly innocent
owners.  The state forfeited Ms. Bennis' interest in her automobile
because her husband used the car for prostitution.  Ms. Bennis
committed no wrong and had no knowledge of the illegal use of
her property.  Nevertheless, the State of Michigan provides no
recourse for innocent owners.<P>
The Institute's brief critiques civil
forfeiture from a property rights perspective and argues that
forfeiture of property held by truly innocent owners is unduly
oppressive and violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment.  Furthermore, the law should not place affirmative
obligations on individuals to police the actions of third parties.
 Rather, the burden should be on the government to demonstrate
that an owner negligently entrusted property to another in order
to expose that individual to civil forfeiture.  The Institute
will also fight the forfeiture of Ms. Bennis' rights in the automobile
on the ground of taking of private property without just compensation.<p>

The Supreme Court of Virginia refused a petition for appeal
by National Football League Player Association (NFLPA) union officials
to overturn a lower court's ruling barring the NFLPA from seizing
forced dues from sixteen current and former Washington Redskins
players, National Right to Work Foundation attorneys announced
today.<p>
The ruling upheld a lower court decision by Loudoun County
Circuit Judge Thomas D. Horne.  Horne last year ruled that it
is a violation of Virginia's Right to Work law for NFLPA union
officials to force Redskin players to pay union dues as a condition
of employment.<p>
Horne's ruling permanently barred player union officials
from requiring former Redskins tight end Terry Orr and other players
to pay union dues.  Orr and fifteen former and current Redskins
players were represented in their legal action by attorneys from
the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation.<p>
  &quot;This
is another enforcement action to guarantee employee rights under
Virginia's Right to Work law, &quot; said Foundation VicePresident
Timothy McConville.  He added, &quot;Every step of the way in
this case, we've prevailed and protected employees' right not
to pay compulsory union dues just to keep their jobs.&quot;<P>

In
December of 1993, NFLPA union officials nearly forced the Redskins
to forfeit their final regular season game by threatening to have
the players who exercised their Right to Work suspended.<p>
The union
claimed that the Redskins were employed in Washington, DC, where
they play their home games, and therefore not covered by Virginia
law.<p>
But the lower court declared that because the Redskins spend
the overwhelming majority of their work time at Redskins Park
in Loudoun County, Virginia, they are Virginia employees, protected
by the state's Right to Work law.<p>
In contrast, players typically
spend only 60 hours before, during, and after home games working
in the District of Columbia.<p>

<b>Supreme
Court Allows Student Initiated Graduation Prayer</b><br>
On June 26 the
Supreme Court vacated the decision of the Ninth Circuit Court
of Appeals in Harris v. Joint School District.  The court's decision
effectively upholds the right to studentinitiated prayer at public
high school graduations.  The Rutherford Institute represented
students in the case.<P>
The case began in 1991, when the ACLU filed
suit against the public high school in Grangeville, Idaho, for
allowing studentinitiated prayer at their graduation ceremony.
 The high school gave complete control over the ceremony to seniors
who voted to include a benediction and invocation.  Initially,
a federal district court ruled in favor of the school, but the
court of appeals reversed the decision, holding that graduation
prayer violated the first amendmentregardless of whether or not
the prayers were studentinitiated.  The Ninth Circuit's decision
was in direct conflict with an earlier decision from the Fifth
Circuit upholding student-initiated graduation prayer.<p>
&quot;The
Supreme Court's refusal to hear the case on the merits means that
the uncertainty over the legality of student-initiated prayer will
continue,&quot; said Rutherford staff attorney Mark Beutler. 
&quot;I am pleased nonetheless that the Court vacated the Ninth
Circuit's decision.  Now students in western states can once again
decide to include prayer in their graduation ceremonies.&quot;<p>
<b>Rutherford
Sues California Superintendent Delaine Easton</b><br>
California State
Superintendent of Schools Delaine Easton as well as a half dozen
other school superintendents have been named defendants in a lawsuit
against the state of California regarding administration of the
California Learning Assessment Systems (CLAS) test.  Despite Governor
Pete Wilson's veto on funding for the controversial CLAS tests,
schools continue to administer test materials without parental
consent or notice.<p>The complaint was amended on Monday, June 19,
to argue that the state violated not only parental rights guarded
by the Constitution, but also federal civil rights laws.  A court
date has been set for October 23, 1995.<p>The original suit, filed
April 21, 1994, sought a temporary restraining order to stop six
San Bernardino County School districts from giving the CLAS test.
 The test requires children to answer personal questions about
their family values, practices, and beliefs as well as questions
pertaining to their relationship with their parents.  Children's
answers may then be referred to Child Protective Services without
ever notifying parents how the test results are being used.  Not
only parents, but also state senators, school board members, and
teachers were denied the opportunity to examine the test before
it was administered.  The defendants in the lawsuit continue to
assert that they have done nothing wrong, insisting that parents
have no right to shield their children from questionable materials
found in public schools.<p>
&quot;This battle will not end until the
State Department of Education is forced to recognize the rights
of parents to guide the education of their children,&quot; said
Frank J. Mistretta, Jr., an attorney handling the case, adding,
&quot;Now is definitely not the time to drop the ball on defending
parents' rights.&quot;<p>
<b>Rutherford Institute Defends School Against
ACLU Suit</b><br>
On June 30, The Rutherford Institute filed a posttrial
brief on behalf of Upshur County Board of Education and Superintendent
Lynn Westfall in response to a lawsuit brought against the school
by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).  The ACLU sued the
school administration for allowing a citizen group to place a
box of free Bibles for students on school property.<p>
The posttrial
brief filed by The Rutherford Institute requests the court to
rule in favor of the school.  The brief argues that the school
acted neutrally by permitting religious materials to be made available
on the same terms and under the same conditions as nonreligious
materials.<P>
The case began on December 6, 1994, when the school
board voted to permit a citizen group comprised of local businesses
to place boxes of Bibles in the Upshur County Public Schools on
February 27, 1995, for students to pick up on a voluntary basis.
 As a result, on February 23, 1995, the ACLU on behalf of several
parents, sued the school and obtained an order forbidding the
school from permitting anyone to make Bibles available to students
while the case was pending.<p>
&quot;We are hopeful that in light
of the Supreme Court's decision in Rosenberger and Pinette, the
court will not require the school to treat private religious speech
occurring during the school day differently than nonreligious
speech,&quot; said Dean Whitford, The Rutherford Institute attorney
handling the case, along with Attorney Michael D. Lorensen.<P>

for protecting the civil liberties of employers during inspections
and investigations.  The petition urged OSHA to provide a &quot;statement
of employers' rights and responsibilities&quot; prior to every
inspection.  Currently, OSHA does not require its inspectors to
inform employers of any of their rights.  WLF's proposed statement
explains employers' rights, including the right to refuse an inspection
that is not authorized by a warrant or its equivalent, to consult
one's legal counsel, and to accompany the inspector throughout
the inspection.  The petition is in response to the results of
WLF's research into OSHA inspection procedures, which disclosed
that OSHA lacks adequate regulations or internal rules for protecting
civil liberties.<p>

<title> Robbing Peter to Pay Grandma
 -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<h2>August <i>Insider</i> -- Robbing Peter To Pay Grandma</h2>
<i><b>by John Liu</i></b>
<hr>

<p>Sunday, July 30, 1995, marked the 30th birthday for one of the federal government's largest and most costly programsMedicare, the huge national health insurance program that covers over 37 million elderly and disabled Americans. Medicare was heralded by proponents as both "historic" and "fiscally responsible." Now, however, Medicare is essentially bankrupt, and its ability to maintain the quality of its services is in doubt. What is not in doubt, is the harsh reality that liberals must face up toMedicare is anything but a fiscally responsible program. The hospitalization insurance (HI) trust fund is projected to be insolvent by the year 2002. Equally important, the cost of the Medicare Supplemental Medical Insurance (SMI) program is exploding. 
Furthermore, U.S. demographics guarantee enormous future burdens on working families. In 1965, when Medicare was enacted, there were almost six workers to every retiree. Today, there are only four. And by 2030, when the nation's 77 million "baby boomers" are well into their retirement, there will be only two workers for every retiree.
<p>
There is a solution to this looming crisis. A solution based on free market principles allowing for consumer choice among competing plans offering different benefits. One prominent model for the reform of the Medicare program, recommended by Heritage scholars, is the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), the system that currently serves 1.6 million retired Members of Congress and federal workers.
<p>
<br>
<h3>Planning and Price Controls</h3>
<p>
While federal government officials have not been successful in accurately projecting the true costs of the Medicare program, they have had even less success in controlling them. Government bureaucrats have embarked on a quest to find the "right price" for thousands of different medical procedures and treatments or specialists and other providers. In some instances, Medicare pays doctors and hospitals and other health care "providers" too much; in other cases, "too little." Such a system encourages doctors and hospitals and other medical "providers" to engage in more or less elaborate attempts to "game" the price control system. Given its current structure, taxpayers should not be surprised that Medicarecannot control costs. The incentives of the current Medicare system conspire to drive costs up.
<p>
Just how expensive will it be to fund Medicare fully under the current system? The 1995 Medicare Trustees (a federal government board) Report provides some sobering information on how payroll taxes (which finance the HI program) would have to rise to keep the program afloat without reform. "To bring the HI program into actuarial balance even for the first 25 years," a new 1.3 percent payroll tax would have to be added to the current 2.9 percent Medicare payroll tax. Based on the trustees' estimates for revenues under the current tax rate, this would raise payroll taxesand hence the cost of employing Americansby an estimated $263 billion over five years and $388 billion over seven years. A worker earning $45,000 would have to pay an additional payroll tax of $585 per year. To achieve long-term actuarial balance of the HI trust fund without reforming the programthat is, to put it on a permanently sound footingan immediate additional payroll tax of 3.52 percent would need to be levied on top of today's 2.9 percent rate. That would raise taxes by $711 billion over five years and $1.050 trillion over seven years. The payroll taxes of a worker earning $45,000 would increase by $1,584 per year.
<p><br>
<h3>A New Model</h3>
<p>If Members of Congress want to retain the single payer, government-run structure of the Medicare program, then they must resort to either much higher taxes or even more draconian controls on doctors and hospitals, including a direct limitation of available services, in a fashion not unlike the British National Health Service.
<p>
If private employer-based insurance is not the best model for the reform of the Medicare system, Members of Congress can always examine their own system, the popular Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP). This is the option proposed by The Heritage Foundation as a model for reform. It is also the model now proposed by the American Medical Association (AMA). 
Unlike Medicare, congressional and federal retirees do not have a government standardized benefits package imposed on them with the FEHBP program, but can pick and choose from a wide variety of plans and options. Medicare, on the other hand, offers almost no meaningful choices. And, in terms of economic efficiency, Medicare's bureaucratic and highly centralized system cannot even begin to compete with the market-based system that currently covers retired Members of Congress and federal employees.
<p>
While Medicare costs have been rising almost 11 percent per year, this year's overall private sector costs rose just 4.4 percent and FEHBP premiums costs actually declined by 3.3 percent. Since the free market forces have proven to work well for Members of Congress and retired Members of Congress, there is no reason why the FEHBP model can't work for our nation's elderly.

Book Review: Martin Malia: The Soviet Tragedy
 -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<h2>August <i>Insider</i> -- In Focus: Book Review</h2>
<I>by Elizabeth Edwards Spalding</i>
<hr>
<b>
The Soviet Tragedy: A History of Socialism in Russia, 1917-1991<br>
Martin Malia (New York: The Free Press, 1994)</b>
<p>
While good books on American history and domestic politics continue to multiply, the same cannot be said of international politics and American foreign policy. For those who are interested in the central conflict of the twentieth century -- the Cold War -- there is good news in the form of Martin Malia's The Soviet Tragedy. A respected, former professor of history at Berkeley, Malia may be best known as Z, the author who exposed the distortions of revisionist Sovietologists and analyzed the potential for the crumbling of the Soviet regime in his 1990 article "To the Stalin Mausoleum." Now Malia offers a masterful study of Western Sovietology and its translations of the Soviet regime and its practices.
<p>
Two models have dominated the field of Soviet studies: first, the totalitarian school that was pioneered in the 1950s, which argued that the Bolshevik revolution was communist and imposed in fact by an intellectual elite and that Lenin and Stalin established and extended a totalitarian state; second, the anti-totalitarian school, which, as it gained momentum in the 1960s and 1970s, maintained that pluralism, consensus building, and compromise characterized the Soviet Union, Lenin, and Stalin's successors. The revisionist anti-totalitarian model has influenced several generations of scholars, students, journalists, and policymakers, many of whom continue to contend that the Cold War ended with Stalin or, certainly, under Khrushchev. They foresaw and generally applauded a convergence between democracy and socialism, and they adduced dtente under Brezhnev as evidence. In this view, Ronald Reagan caused a second Cold War, and Mikhail Gorbachev deserved every accolade as man of the decade. Noteworthy exceptions to revisionism --such as Robert Conquest, Richard Pipes, and Malia-- constitute a pilloried minority.<P255D>
<p>
According to Malia, the totalitarian model is more correct than the anti-totalitarian model. To qualify as a totalitarian dictatorship, the classic definition requires an elaborate ideology, a single mass party, terror, a technologically conditioned monopoly of communication, a monopoly of weapons, and a centrally controlled economy. Malia never disputes the totalitarian nature of the Soviet system. But he qualifies his approval of the totalitarian model, since the rigidity of this model does not explain well "the obvious mellowing of the Soviet system in the decades after Stalin's death."
<p>
Malia suggests that Eastern European intellectuals, such as Poland's Adam Michnik, and other survivors of communism supply the deficiencies of the totalitarian model. Eastern Europeans applied totalitarian to a regime in which total control was the basic aspiration, while realizing that such a regime did not have to (and could not) exercise total control over its population. Explains Malia: "It did not mean that such regimes were omnipotent in performance, but rather that they were omnicompetent in their institutional structure. In short, it was not Soviet society that was totalitarian; rather, it was the Soviet state." While seeing the whole of the totalitarian objective, it is possible to distinguish between the "high totalitarianism" of Stalin and the routine totalitarianism of Brezhnev.
<p>
Malia imparts a lucid history of Soviet domestic and foreign policies, which is especially detailed where newly released information bolsters his argument. Throughout his discussion, he threads a sophisticated analysis of the Hegelian and Marxist foundations to socialism. Academic or not, readers will benefit particularly from his assessments of 1939-1953, 1982-1988, and 1989-1991. Unlike most other Western Sovietologists, Malia grasps that the Cold War began in 1917, that the Soviet Union made great gains during World War II, and that the East-West conflict then hardened in the postwar era. He also verifies the impact of Reagan's policies on the USSR, including SDI as a "technological and economic challenge the Soviets could neither ignore nor match." To explain the death throws of the USSR, Malia draws the important distinction between the profound and proximate causes of the great crash of 1989-1991. He does not make the mistake of attributing the demise of the USSR only to internal economic factors; rather, he assays that economic decline and its discrediting of ideology are the most important proximate causes. It is crucial to see these proximate causes of the Soviet collapse as "parts of a pattern arising from the nature of that system itself." As Malia concludes, socialism was founded on the profound Myth of radical egalitarianism and then transformed into the Lie: "In sum, there is no such thing as socialism, and the Soviet Union built it."
<p>
For those not embroiled in the ongoing academic warfare over the Cold War, Malia's points may seem manifest. The documents that are now available vindicate his position. To date, however, Malia's book --with its combined understanding of the Soviet regime and its practices, its rise and fall, and its interpretersis unique in the study of the Cold War.

<i><h3>National Security and Foreign Policy</h3></i>
<p>
<b>Clinton's ABM Treaty Muddle,</b> by Kim R. Holmes and Baker Spring<br>
<i>Committee Brief No. 16</i>, The Heritage Foundation
<p> 
Heritage vice president Kim Holmes and policy analyst Baker Spring focus on the inconsistencies in the Clinton administration's approach to the ABM Treaty. This brief, presented to the Senate Armed Services Committee on July 7, suggests five steps to overcome the confusion in the administration's policies: 1) Recognize that maintaining the ability to confront, and if need be destroy, the means of attack that may be used against the American people, their territory, their forces overseas, and their vital interests, will be the cornerstone of strategic stability in the post-Cold War world; 2) Recognize that the distinction between strategic and theater defenses is an arbitrary one; 3) Recognize that missile defense is an indispensable part of an effective counterproliferation policy; 4) Seek a cooperative approach with Russia and others for transcending the ABM Treaty; and 5) Seek genuine cooperation with Congress regarding missile defense and the future of the ABM Treaty. Holmes and Spring maintain that these steps will resolve the contradictions in the President's approach to the ABM Treaty. 7 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 565, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail 74157.372@compuserve.com.

<b>The Mystery of Japanese Growth,</b> by Ramesh Ponnuru<br>
<i>Rochester Paper No. 4,</i> Centre for Policy Studies and American Enterprise Institute
<p>
Ramesh Ponnuru, a student at Princeton University, examines the cause of Japan's economic strength and why, according to the author, America and Europe falsely believe this strength threatens their own economies. Ponnuru writes, "Neither a concern about trade imbalances nor fear of Japan's potential to surpass the economic might of other nations justify the adoption of self-destructive policies by those nations. America and Europe should refrain from raising their drawbridges against Japanese commerce, setting targets for trade in specific sectors, or indeed for overall trade balances, or forcing Japan to cut its savings rate." The author argues that many critics of Japan falsely credit Japan's success with the interventionist policies of its government. Ponnuru unequivocally believes that, on balance, interventions in the Japanese marketplace have hindered rather than helped Japan's economy. 47 pp. CONTACT: Centre for Policy Studies, 52 Rochester Row, London SW1P 1JU, 071-828-1176.

<b>Soviet in Public, Azeri in Private: Gender, Islam, and Nationalism in Post-Soviet Azerbaijan,</b> by Nayereh Tohidi<br>
<i>Working Papers No. I-95-9,</i> Hoover Institution
<p>
Nayareh Tohidi, research fellow and visiting scholar at the Hoover Institution, focuses on the intersection of gender, state socialism, nationality, and religion in Soviet and post-Soviet republic of Azerbaijan. The interplay between the Soviet state policy towards the "national question" and the "woman question" is demonstrated in the Muslim Azerbaijani context. It shows that, although Muslim Azeri women have accomplished an impressive level of emancipation, their overall status remains flawed with contradictions and duality. Similar to women of several other countries in the Muslim world confronting colonial domination or semi-colonial intrusion, Azeri women's liberation has been held hostage to their assigned responsibility as the primary repositories of tradition, ethnic, and national identity. In conclusion, gender dynamics of recent changes and a new search for national identity in the ethnically contested and war-stricken context of newly independent Azerbaijan is briefly explored. 30 pp. CONTACT: Hoover Institution Press, Stanford University Press, Stanford, CA 94305-6010, 415/723-3373.

<b>Keeping America Great: Toward a New Foreign Policy Doctrine,</b> by Malcolm Wallop<br>
<i>Heritage Lecture Series No. 526,</i> The Heritage Foundation
<p>
Former Senator from Wyoming and distinguished fellow at The Heritage Foundation Malcolm Wallop describes, in his remarks to Heritage's Annual Board Meeting in San Diego, how America, since the Bush presidency, has allowed her role as world leader to slip away. Wallop describes the effects of the "utter vacuum of [foreign] policy." The administration's focus on the economy led to further cuts in the military and lack of policy definition, and Wallop states, "No great nation can remain great, free, and prosperous without strength, purpose, and courage. Today America has the latter, some of the former, and none of the middle." To reconcile this situation, Wallop names six essential components of a new doctrine: "First, the safety of the homeland is the paramount obligation. Second, America has an interest in a world at peace, if only for economic reasons. Third, we are a trading nation needing markets as well as access to supplies. Fourth, we are a communicating nation, and that means access to space. Fifth, we are a nation of travelers and scholars. Sixth, we are a nation of conscience and freedomnot to impose it, but surely to support it." 5 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 565, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail 74157.372@compuserve.com.

<b>Do Sanctions Work? Economic Sanctions as a Tool of US Foreign Policy</b>
<i>Conference Summary,</i> American Enterprise Institute
<p>
This summary provides the comments of two separate panels, the first entitles "SanctionsImportant or Ineffective Tool of Foreign Policy." Shaun Donnely, deputy assistant secretary for energy, sanctions, and commodities for the US Department of State, described sanctions as the answer to situations where diplomatic initiatives are insufficient, but military action is not justified. Julius Katz, president of Hills & Company, points out that sanctions, in their historical context, have rarely worked. Zalmay Khalilzad, director of the Program for Strategy, Defense and Force Structure for RAND Project AIR FORCE, clearly regards sanctions (including the embargo of military technology) as an important instrument foreign policy in the post-Cold War era. Richard Perle, resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute uses the reasons to support sanctions which had been presented by Shaun Donnely and argues that they are exactly the reasons to oppose sanctions. Perle suggests that the US resorts to sanctions rather than a military effort is when it is not prepared to "bear the costs of real and effective action." The second panel, "The Efficacy of SanctionsThe Iraq, Iran, and Cuba Cases" examines the results of sanctions in these three countries. Micheal Eisenstadt, military fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy; James Kinnear, former president and CEO of Texaco Inc.; and Otto Reich, director of the Brock Group offer their differing views. 8 pp. CONTACT: American Enterprise Institute, 1150 17th St., NW, Washington, DC 20036, 202/862-5800.

<b>Commerce, Infrastructure & Regulation</b>
<b>Fair Lending Enforcement: How the Government Micromanages Banking,</b> by David J. McPherson<br>
Washington Legal Foundation
<p>
David McPherson, a banking and real estate attorney, argues that the recent fair lending enforcement campaign by the Department of Justice sets a disturbing precedent of the executive branch legislating by consent decree. This monograph discusses the legal basis for the Department of Justice enforcement actions and describes how, by prosecuting lending institutions for alleged discriminatory lending practices and forcing these institutions into consent decrees, the Justice Department has gone far beyond what is required by the federal fair lending laws and has confused sound lending practices with racial discrimination. McPherson advocates the cessation of attempts by the Justice Department to micromanage lending institutions and the encouragement in careful and consistent regulation and voluntary fair lending compliance by the lending community. 41 pp. CONTACT: Washington Legal Foundation, 2009 Massachusetts Ave., NW, Washington, DC 20036, 202/588-0302.

Michal Tosovsky, president of the Czech Government Office for Standards, Metrology and Testing, defines the problems of regulation, focusing on Czech legislation since 1989, developments in the European Union, and experience gained from over-regulation in the United States. Tosovsky cites examples of excessive Czech legislation in the last five years: the Trading Act, Construction Act, Act on Authorized Architects and Engineers, Consumer Protection Act, Act on Czech Business Inspection Bureau, and the Act on State Testing. This paper examines these pieces of legislation and demonstrates the precedent they set for future increased regulation.

<b>The Myths and Realities of Trade Deficits,</b> by Bryan T. Johnson<br>
<i>Backgrounder No. 1039</i>, The Heritage Foundation
<p>
Heritage policy analyst Bryan Johnson argues that the driving force behind the Clinton Administration's threat of trade sanctions against Japan and its other managed trade policies is a misguided belief that trade deficits are harmful to the economy. Johnson states that the administration's managed trade policies are based on a number of faulty assumptions and myths about trade deficits including: trade deficits are harmful and trade surpluses are beneficial; trade deficits cost jobs; Japan's prosperity is based on trade surpluses generated by managed trade policies; since the US is unable to sell some goods and services in Japan, their markets must be closed; and trade sanctions to redress imbalances will protect American jobs. Johnson challenges each of these assumptions and others, proving that trade retaliation, in most cases, has failed to open markets while costing American consumers billions in higher prices. 7 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 565, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail 74157.372@compuserve.com.

<b>Reinventing the Regulatory System: No Downsizing in Administration Plan,</b> by Melinda Warren and Barry Jones<br>

<p>
Researchers Melinda Warren and Barry Jones question the administration's call for $16.6 billion in spending for regulatory programs in fiscal year 1996. Warren and Jones point out that this represents a 3.3 percent real increase, even after adjusting for inflation. This report also predicts that staffing figures will reach a new peak in 1996132,000 regulators.

<b>Trade Policy Ahead: Three Tracks and One Question,</b> by Ernest H. Preeg<br>
Center for Strategic and International Studies
<p>
Ernest Preeg, the William M. Scholl Chair in International Business at CSIS, asserts that the structure of world trade has changed fundamentally in three ways since the early 1980s: 1) international trade in goods and services has become increasingly related to the international flow of capital, technology, and laborthe factors of production; 2)national economies and corporate strategies are increasingly dependent on international markets due largely to information-based technological change; 3)the polarization of the global industrialization process into three regions (Western Europe, North America, and East Asia) has intensified, one-half of world trade now takes place within these three regions. Preeg demonstrates that the changed structure has been reinforced by another change in the international trading systemfrom a multilateral yet, according to the author, narrowly drawn GATT to a system of multilateral commitments, regional free trade agreements, and selective bilateral accords.<i> Trade Policy Ahead </i>poses the question of how to manage the three tracks in a consistent, mutually reinforcing way toward broadly established goals. Preeg writes, "The time is finally ripe to include international investment policy within the framework of the multilateral trading system . . . and a central objective should be to launch negotiations for expansion of the WTO to a WTIOa World Trade and Investment Organization." 75 pp. CONTACT: The Center for Strategic and International Studies, 1800 K St., NW, Suite 400, Washington, DC 20006, 202/887-0200.

<h3><i>Taxation and Budget</i></h3>
<p>
<b>The Great Tax Debate: Making Sense of Competing Tax Plans,</b> by Raymond J. Keating<br>
Small Business Survival Foundation
<p>
Raymond Keating, chief economist for the Small Business Survival Foundation, evaluates the current tax system and the leading proposals for reformthe flat tax, national retail sales tax, consumed-income tax, and the value-added tax (VAT). Each tax plan is analyzed according to eight criteria: ability to promote economic growth, rate of capital taxation, inflation factor, clarity of the tax system, simplicity, limits to bureaucracy and intrusiveness, minimized incentives for tax avoidance, and limitations to government spending. Keating offers a simple scoring system, assigning one point for each criteria fulfilled, a half point for each partially met, and zero points for those not met at all. From highest to lowest, the plans scored as follows: flat tax, national retail sales tax, VAT, consumed income tax, and the current income tax. The author concludes by recommending reducing the size of the federal government substantially and moving to a low, flat income tax of 10 percent, with no taxation of capital gains, dividends, interest from savings, or business income. Keating ultimately suggests repealing the 16th Amendment and replacing the income tax with a nation retail sales tax of less than 10 percent. 38 pp. CONTACT: Small Business Survival Foundation, 1320 18th Street, NW, Suite 2000, Washington, DC 20036, 202/785-0238, fax 202/822-8118.

<b>A Citizen's Guide to the State Budget Mess: A Menu of 217 Proposals to Reduce State Government Spending,</b> by Tom McClintock<br>
<i>Briefings</i>, The Claremont Institute
<p>
Former California Assemblyman Tom McClintock presents 217 specific reductions that could be made in the 1995-1996 California budget. Total savings from these proposals, which include contracting out services, abolishing obsolete agencies and programs, controlling the growth of the bureaucracy, and operation reforms, amount to more that $11.7 billion, including $1.2 billion in proposals by the Legislative Analyst's Office in 64 items. This work breaks the budget down into ten areas, from state and consumer services to health and welfare to youth and adult corrections. The author identifies many of the smaller, less costly programs that often get "lost" in the process of compiling large budgets. The savings amount to 13 percent of all funds proposed to be spent in the Governor's budget, or 18 percent of General and Special Funds. These proposals would also eliminate $725 million in fees to California citizens. 51 pp. CONTACT: The Claremont Institute, 2012 H St., Suite 101, Sacramento, CA 95814, 916/446-7924.

<b>What To Do About Medicare,</b> Stuart M. Butler, Robert E. Moffitt, and John C. Liu<br>
<i>Backgrounder No. 1038</i>, The Heritage Foundation
<p>
Stuart Butler, vice president and director of domestic and economic policy studies, Bob Moffitt, deputy director of domestic policy studies, and John Liu, policy analyst, demonstrate that for the Medicare system to achieve long-term actuarial balance without reform, the trust fund would require an immediate payroll tax increase of 3.52 percent, which would raise taxes by $711 billion over the next five years. This increase would only fund the hospital program, not the fund for physicians' services. This paper suggests, "Instead of trying to tighten current controls on deregulation, the proper reform is to create a very different dynamic and set of incentives to drive the Medicare program. Specifically, the bureaucratic, standardized, command-and-control structure of today's Medicare must be replaced with consumer choice among competing plans offering different benefits." Butler, Moffit, and Liu recommend offering the a plan modeled after the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan. The major difference between this and the current system is that the government would make a defined financial contribution to the plan of the retiree's choice, rather that reimbursing Washington-approved service according to a fee schedule. This paper concludes that if Congress fails to institute fundamental reform, either the elderly will be faced with a dramatic reduction in health service or working families will be forced to pay sharply higher payroll taxes. Reform would provide a new Medicare system based on consumer choice, with security for both today and tomorrow's retirees. 22 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 565, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail 74157.372@compuserve.com.

<b>Medical Savings Accounts: Answering the Critics</b>, by Michael Tanner<br>
<i>Policy Analysis No. 228</i>, Cato Institute
<p>
Michael Tanner, director of health and welfare studies at Cato, seeks to answer the concerns of the critics of consumer-based health care. Tanner addresses four questions often raised by those who oppose MSAs: claims that health care has become so complex that consumers are unable to make cost-conscious decisions about their treatment; claims that consumers will forgo necessary or preventative care to save money in their medical savings accounts; claims that MSAs would attract the healthy, while the sick remain in conventional insurance programs; and claims that MSAs are regressive, providing benefits primarily to the wealthy. This paper provides the information that supporters of MSAs require to rebut the arguments of those opposing reform. The author admits that MSAs are not perfect, but maintains that they represent a significant step toward solving the cost and access problems of our health care system. 18 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Ave., NW, Washington, DC 20001, 202/842-0200.

<b>The Private-Sector Health Care Revolution: How It's Controlling Costs Across Florida and America,</b> by Melanie S. Tammen<br>
<i>Backgrounder No. 16</i>, James Madison Institute
<p>
James Madison Institute research associate Melanie Tammen reveals that, despite the failure of Medicare and Medicaid, Florida Governor Lawton Chiles and President Clinton continue to promote plans which will force more and more people into government-intermediated health care programs. This paper maintains that Chiles' Florida Health Security Plan would dramatically expand the scope of the state's 11 new regional purchasing alliances by having them sell government subsidized health plans to low and middle-income residents. Tammen recommends reforms that facilitate universal coverage and affordability in marketplace, rather than plans to provide universal coverage along with large, expensive, taxpayer-financed programs.

This paper surveys opinions and beliefs of health managers and doctors in the West of Scotland. Bruce and Hill demonstrate that future reforms will require the input of both managers and doctors, in order to define a common agenda. This work begins the process of discovering the views of doctors, managers, and consultants towards research, management, medical direction, clinical direction, and training and preparation of doctors for management.

<b>Government in Health Care: Lessons from the UK</b>, by W. Duncan Reekie<br>
The Smith Center for Private Enterprise Studies
<p>
Duncan Reekie, the Bradlow Professor of Business Economics at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, criticizes, as one who grew up under Britain's National Health Service (NHS), the Clinton administration's approach to health care. The proponents of NHS used the same arguments used by the Clintons, and the author investigates these arguments, revealing their flaws from 1948 and now. Reekie recognizes that the Clintons' plan is substantially different from the NHS and that most of the alternate plans in Congress are subject to market-based objections as well. The author discusses why he believes a Clinton health care program, like the NHS, would lead to a politicized health care system dominated by special interests, "fostering not trust but distrust between patient and physician." Reekie demonstrates that once a government-dominated health care system is in place, it is nearly impossible to abolish. This paper warns the American electorate of the perils of national health care and urges Americans to learn from the mistakes of the UK. 116 pp. CONTACT: The Smith Center for Private Enterprise Studies, School of Business and Economics, California State University, Hayward, CA 94542, 510/885-3275, or fax 510/885-4442.

The current<i> Critical Issues Bulletin </i>attempts to document the extent to which lines are being used as a means of adapting to the conflict between limited budgetary allocations and potentially unlimited demand for free health care in the Canadian health system. Ramsay and Walker compiled data based on the waiting time in hospitals across Canada. The results suggest, based on the increased waiting times and the increased concern of the government to continue to supply the norm of health care services, that waiting lists have become an alternative to rising prices by restraining health care expenses in a system where prices have been systematically eliminated and neither physicians nor patients have any economic incentive to consider the costs of their decisions. 50 pp. CONTACT: The Fraser Institute, 626 Bute St., Vancouver, BC, CANADA V6E 3MI, 604/688-0221.

<b>Welfare Reform: Allow Welfare to Wither So Charities Can Bloom,</b> by Stuart Anderson<br>
<i>Issue Brief</i>, The Alexis de Tocqueville Institution
<p>
Stuart Anderson, policy director at the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution, suggests that public policy analysts should pose two questions: in what areas are charitable organizations superior to the government in providing sevices to those less fortunate? and how can American society put more resources into the hands of charitable organizations to provide those services? This paper recommends that these decisions be made at a local level, and therefore the federal welfare system must give states flexibility to design their own approaches without interference from Washington. This study presents three significant findings: 1) the non-profit group Community for Creative Non-Violence spent $365,000 in 1992 to house 1400 homeless individuals on a nightly basis, while the DC government spent $26.4 million to house 2280 homeless people nightly in government shelters; 2) over a period of years, the city government paid the Pitts Hotel the $12.48 per person, per day for food, which amounted to 78 times the cost of three meals provided by the charity-run DC Central Kitchen (with donations and food purchased from local food banks, the DC Kitchen can serve meals at a cost of 16 cents per person.); and 3) advocates for the poor are restricted by regulations that  limit flexibility and creativity. 8 pp. CONTACT: The Alexis de Tocqueville Institution, 2000 15th Street North, Suite 501, Arlington, VA 22201, 703/351-4969, or fax 703/351-0090.

Milton Friedman addresses the immediate need to reconstruct the education system at both the elementary and secondary levels to offset the growing wage differential crisis in the United States. He recommends privatizing a large segment of the school system, allowing for the creation of a for-profit education industry. This plan would offer effective competition to public schools by creating a free-market for choice in education. The system he proposes enables parents to select the schools their children attend by means of a universal voucher system that would be sufficient to cover the costs of a high-quality education. 7 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Ave., NW, Washington, DC 20001, 202/842-0200.

<p>
Allyson M. Tucker, policy council director at the National Policy Forum, and William F. Lauber aid to Representative Chris Cox (R-CA); both former Heritage Foundation analysts, report strong evidence that concludes that the school choice movement is gaining ground at the state level. Their argument originates from the strong results pro-school choice candidates had at the polls in the 1994 elections, indicating that 1995 could be the year that school choice legislation will make significant gains. Lisa Graham was elected for state superintendent of schools in Arizona, with 59 percent of the vote, on a platform centered on school choice. At the gubernatorial level, candidates such as George W. Bush of Texas, George Pataki of New York, and John Rowland of Connecticut won as advocates of school choice. Proponents of choice can also expect action from Congress in 1995. Debate is going on in both chambers on "how the federal government can help states implement choice." Discussion is expected to focus on using funds from Chapter One for vouchers. Chapter One is the largest federal aid program for poor elementary and secondary students. Other articles address the tax status of the NEA and deregulating schools. 3 pp. CONTACT: The Heartland Institute, 800 East Northwest Highway, Suite 1080, Palantine, IL 60067-6516, 708/202-3060, or fax 708/202-9799.

Marshall advocates the theory that parents, as opposed to government bureaucrats, are more able to select the schools their children attend based upon: the values they embrace, the teachers they employ, and the curriculum they uphold. The author also provides an in-depth section in his paper devoted to rebutting the attacks school choice opponents most commonly use to halt the movement. He debunks fifteen myths surrounding the school choice debate, including: 1) school choice is unconstitutional at state and local levels; 2) choice carries a heavy price tag; 3) school choice will wipe out the gains made in desegregation; and 4) choice will relegate poor children to the worst schools. 52 pp. CONTACT: Floridians for Educational Choice, P.O.

John E. Berthoud, vice president of The Alexis de Tocqueville Institution, presents his case for eliminating the U.S. Department for Education. While debate continues on the educational benefits of returning control of education to state and local governments, Berthoud's paper makes the case for the potential cost savings of such decentralization. Terminating the department would eliminate the cost of maintaining a separate bureaucracy and the interest group pressures to increase spending. Alexis de Tocqueville Institution also reported the following findings: 1) eliminating the U.S. Department of Education would save taxpayers $15.7 billion dollars over a five-year period; 2) since education became the 12th cabinet department in 1979, the department's spending has risen three times as fast as the non-defense discretionary budget; and 3) taxpayers would have saved 5 billion dollars since 1979, if federal education spending had grown at the same rate as non-defense discretionary spending. 17pp. CONTACT: The Alexis de Tocqueville Institution, 2000 15th Street North, Suite 501, Arlington, VA 22201, 703/351-4969, or fax 703/351-0090.

As Congress attempts to repair the damage of Superfund legislation, Mahoney suggests Ten Points of Resolution: retroactive liability should be retained as in the current law; insurance issues should be left to settlement by the parties involved; joint and several liability would be replaced by proportionate liability; the highest priority is the completion of Superfund's Emergency Removal program; no new additions should be made to the Superfund NPL list during the life of the Emergency Removal program; Superfund sites should be divided into two categories, those where containment is satisfactory and those whose future use is yet undetermined or unlikely to be industrial; a substantial amount of Superfund moneys would be allocated to proposals to develop cost-effective, neighbor-friendly permanent remediation; communities should be empowered and funded for full participation in the Superfund Trust; minor participants at sites should be relieved from all future liability upon payment of a nominal share; and minority and/or poor communities would receive preferential priority. Mahoney suggests that these Ten Points of Resolution represent an outline for Superfund reform and provide a basis for tradeoffs among the various parties' interests. 9 pp. CONTACT: Center for the Study of American Business, Washington University, Campus Box 1208, St. Louis, MO 63130-4899, 314/935-5630.

<i><b>Different Drummer,</i></i> edited by Randal O'Toole<br>
Spring 1995 Vol.2 No.2, The Thoreau Institute
<p>
This month's issue focuses on reinventing the forest service and creating an agency that works better and costs less. "Free Intraprising the Forest Service" reveals that, in the Forest Service's reinvention plan, a major innovation involves internal enterprise units. "Timber Sale Subsidies, But Who Gets Them?" reports that Forest Service's 1993 and 1994 returns to the Treasury were $800 million less than cost. This article seeks to explain that the financial losses from 1993 were, in fact, not a subsidy by the government to the industry. This issue also presents a brief history of the Forest Service and a synopsis of the problems diagnosed in other Thoreau Institute publications. 64 pp. CONTACT: The Thoreau Institute, 14417 SE Laurie, Oak Grove, OR 97267, 503/652-7049.

<b>Time to Reopen the Clean Air Act: Clearing Away the Regulatory Smog,</b> by K.H. Jones and Jonathan Adler<br>
<i><b>Policy Analysis No. 233</i></b>, Cato Institute
<p>
K.H. Jones, president of Zephyr Consulting Company, and Jonathan Adler, associate director of environmental studies at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, argue that the national policy on the control of urban smog is misguided because it fails to account for current population trends and is based on the anomalous meteorological conditions of 1988. This paper describes how this is particularly important in the Ozone Transport Region, the 12 states from Virginia to Maryland. The regulatory programs being proposed resemble the low-emission vehicle standards in California. The authors write, "The sort of control for control's sake' pollution control strategies pursued by the EPA and the Ozone Transportation Commission are largely inappropriate because they are neither cost-effective nor equitable means of achieving emissions reductions, even should such reductions be necessary." This paper recommends alleviating unneeded and costly regulatory mandates under the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. 47 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Ave., NW, Washington, DC 20001, 202/842-0200.

<i>Backgrounder No. 1040,</i> The Heritage Foundation
<p>
Marshall Wittman, Heritage senior fellow in Congressional Affairs, and Charles P. Griffin, Heritage deputy House liaison, reveal that each year American taxpayers provide more than $39 billion in grants to organizations which may use the money to advance their political agendas. They find that Congress has helped create a vast patronage network of organizations that enjoy tax-preferred status, receive federal funds, and engage in legislative or political advocacy. Wittman and Griffin write, "Taxpayer funding of advocacy groups is wrongfiscally, morally, and logically. It is fiscally irresponsible to spend federal revenues on activities that provide no meaningful return to the people. And it is logically wrong for the government to fund activities that often result in lobbying for increased federal expenditures." This paper cites many of the recipients of federal money: the AFL-CIO, Service Employees International Union, Families USA, The Child Welfare League of America, The National Trust for Historic Preservation, The American Nurses Association, and The American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees. 12 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 565, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail 74157.372@compuserve.com.

While Korten endorses the legislative branch reducing its own staff, he sees two unintended consequences with one branch reducing the staff of another: 1) since no overall reductions are made in the size of the executive branch bureaucracy, no money will be saved by eliminating 800 political appointeestheir slots will be filled by career bureaucrats; and 2) since those slots would be filled with career bureaucrats, Congress would solidify the grip of Washington's "permanent government" on the operation of the federal establishment. 6 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 565, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail 74157.372@compuserve.com.

<b>Defenders Unclog Brace's Path to High Court</b><br>
Defenders of Property Rights has come to the aid of Pennsylvania farmer Bob Brace, who is being prosecuted by the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. He has been accused of violating federal wetlands statutes. Defenders has filed an amicus brief in support of Mr. Brace's petition to have his case heard by the U.S. Supreme Court. The government claims Brace violated Section 404(f) of the Clean Water Act when he upgraded his farm's drainage system in 1977. This improvement, which allowed him to farm thirty acres of land that was previously useful for little more than pasture, was cited as an unpermitted discharge of fill. The EPA ordered him to remove the drainage system to allow the land to return to its alleged "natural state" as a wetland. Failure to do so could subject him to fines as high as $25,000 a day.
Mr. Brace contends his changes to the property are permitted by the Clean Water Act. Section 404(f) states that discharge permits are not required for "normal farming activity," specifically stating "the maintenance of drainage ditches...is not prohibited by or otherwise subject to regulation under this section."<br>
Brace can expect word from the high court as to whether whey will hear his case sometime this fall.

Former University of Kansas Law School professor Emil A.

Landmark Legal Foundation is representing Professor Tonkovich, who was fired for allegedly sexually harassing a student.<br>
The controversy began I May of 1991, when a female student initially accused Tonkovich of making "a pass" at her following a school party three years ago. He has vehemently denied the charge. Several months later, this accusation mushroomed into an allegation of sex and sexual harassment. The allegation was uncorroborated and was contradicted by other female students.
"The widespread use of smear tactics to drive politically incorrect professors off campuses poses a dangerous threat to academic freedom in this country," said Landmark President Jerald L. Hill. "This lawsuit will help send the message that conservative professors will not be silenced."<br>

Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Strikes Down Scheme that Raised Utility Costs
In a case in which the New England Legal Foundation filed a friend of the court brief, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court struck down an ordinance enacted by the city of Somerville which required utilities to pay a single contractor chosen by the city to do all excavation and paving work on city streets. The chosen contractor had used its government-created monopoly to charge utilities twice the rate it charged for such work in neighboring towns.<br>
The "City Contract Representative" was chosen by the city but paid by any utility that had to do street work. Bid specifications were so narrowly drawn that only one contractor qualified for the job. Utilities which refused to use the Representative were denied needed permits. The Representative had no incentive to work quickly nor, because its pay is based on the amount of asphalt used, efficiently. Because the city instructed the Representative to put the street into better condition than it was before being opened, it was able to make utilities and, ultimately, their customers pay for routine street work.<br>
An <i>amicus  </i>brief filed by NELF argued that the Somerville ordinance was not only unwise but that it exceeded the city's legal authority to maintain public streets and conflicted with state's supervisory power over utility regulation. In effect, NELF argued, Somerville had imposed an unauthorized and illegal tax on all utility customers. The Supreme Judicial Court has now agreed.

<b>NELF to File Brief in Connecticut Trespasser Tort Case</b><br>
In Hartford, Connecticut, a thief decided to steal from what appeared to be an abandoned electric switchbox, despite bold-faced warning signs posted in English and Spanish. When the thief was shocked and seriously injured, he sued the utility, claiming that it should have taken more care to protect potential thieves from possible injuries. A Superior Court judge in Connecticut threw out the case; the thief is appealing.<br>
NELF will file an<i> amicus </i>brief supporting the lower court. In this case, as in other recent Rhode Island and Vermont cases, NELF will argue that the traditional common law rule, that landowners are not obliged to spend money making their property safe for trespassers, is both good and sound public policy. Furthermore, NELF will argue that a state PUC rule, which requires utilities to take reasonable precautions to ensure that consumers and others are not endangered by company equipment, did not require anything more than the clear and visible warnings which the company did post.<br>

<b>Fighting Against Government Extortion</b><br>
<i>Ehrlich v. City of Culver City.</i> In June, PLF filed a friend of the court brief in the California Supreme Court in one of the most important "regulatory takings" cases to come before the state justices in 17 years. Since 1992, PLF has been supporting Richard Ehrlich's attempt to invalidate "mitigating" fees imposed on him as a condition for receiving a permit to construct a housing development.<br>
For several years, Mr. Ehrlich operated a private tennis club but was unable to make a financial success of it. In 1988, he closed the facility and donated most of the movable equipment to the city and proposed a town-house condominium project on the property. The City Council approved the building project on the condition that Mr. Ehrlich pay $280,000, which the city estimated was the cost of building replacement tennis courts.<br>
PLF contends that the fee is unconstitutional because it fails the rough proportionality test laid down last June by the U.S. Supreme Court in<i> Dolan v. City of Tigard.</i> In<i> Dolan,</i> The Supreme Court invalidated a condition by the City of Tigard, Oregon, that a landowner give 10% of her property for public use in exchange for a permit to expand her plumbing supply store. Such conditions for a permit are justifiable only if local officials can show that there is a reasonable connection or essential "nexus" between the conditions and any harm caused by the project being permitted. The extent of the exaction must also be "roughly proportional" to the project's impact on the community.<br>
PLF helped Mr. Ehrlich win an order from the U.S. Supreme Court that 1) vacated a Court of Appeal ruling upholding the city's fees, and 2) sent the case back to the appellate court with instructions to reconsider in light of the <i>Dolan</i> decision. The Court of Appeal affirmed that development fees must meet the high level of scrutiny required by <i>Dolan.</i> Unfortunately, it misapplied the<i> Dolan </i>test to the facts of this case and held that the fee was related to the impacts caused by a change in land use designation needed for the construction of the condominiums.<br>
PLF also will assist Mr. Ehrlich's attorney in preparing for oral argument before the state Supreme Court.

<b>U.S. Supreme Court Strikes Down Congressional Ballot Access Restrictions</b><br>
<i>U.S. Term Limits v. Thorton.</i> In a major setback for term limit proponents, the U.S. Supreme Court held on May 22, that voter-enacted ballot access restrictions on members of Congress are unconstitutional. In a 5-to-4 ruling, the Justices held that the qualifications for congressional services set forth in the Constitution are "fixed" in that they may not be supplemented by Congress or the states. PLF, on behalf of Citizens for Term Limits filed friend of the court briefs in the case urging the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the case and arguing in support of Arkansas' ballot access measure, Amendment 73.<br>
Amendment 73, an amendment to Arkansas' constitution, prohibited the name of an otherwise eligible candidate for Congress form appearing on the general election ballot if that candidate had already served three terms in the House of Representatives or two terms in the Senate. That person could run as a write-in candidate, however. PLF attorneys argued, among other things, that the U.S. Constitution permits states to regulate the "time, place, and manner" of elections. They asserted that measures like Amendment 73 do not bar anyone from running for office, but only restrict ballot access in certain circumstances.<br>
The High Court ruled that the Constitution is the exclusive source of qualifications for members of Congress and that states may not add qualifications. Even though Amendment 73 allows congressional candidates to run as "write-in" candidates and serve if elected, the Court nevertheless considered this to be an indirect attempt at evading the Qualifications Clause's requirements.
The ruling has absolutely nothing to do with term limits on state officeholders. But according to recent news stories some term limit opponents are claiming the decision may open the door to a renewed challenge to term limits imposed on state legislators and constitutional officers. PLF successfully represented the proponents of California's Proposition 140 (state term limits) before the California and United Sates Supreme Courts. Any attempt to relitigate and overturn that settled victory will be met by a forceful defense by PLF attorneys.

<b>Important Rent Control Victory in New York Upheld</b><br>
<i>Manocherian v. Lenox Hill Hospital</i>. Late May, the U.S. Supreme Court denied review and let stand a key property rights decision by New York's highest court. Last October, the New York Court of Appeals struck down a provision of the state's rent control law relating to the subleasing of rent-stabilized apartments as applied to nonprofit hospitals. PLF filed a friend of the court brief in support of the property owner.<br>
Lenox Hill Hospital leases rent-stabilized apartments in New York and subleases them to its nurses as an employee benefit. Ten years ago, Lenox Hill Secured passage of a law that required apartment owners who lease apartments to the hospital to offer lease renewals directly to Lenox Hill rather than to the individual nurses who occupy the apartments. Because Lenox Hill has a perpetual corporate existence, this law has the effect of denying the owners any expectation of being able to reoccupy their property, as they could if their primary tenant was a natural person. <br>
New York's highest court declared the law to be unconstitutional for "not substantially advancing a closely and legitimately connected State interest."<br>
In its majority opinion, the Court of Appeals returned again and again to <i>Nollan's </i>requirement that property regulations be closely related to the advancement of a legitimate governmental interest. <i>Nollan </i>and other recent Supreme Court cases are seen to lay down "a constitutional minimum floor of protection which this Court lacks authority to diminish under the Supremacy Clause."<br>

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sued the Upshur County Board of Education and Superintendent Lynn Westfall because they agreed to allow a citizen group to place a box of free Bibles for students on school property. The Rutherford Institute represented the school board and the superintendent in the case tried before U.S. District Court Judge Irene M. Keeley.<br>
The case began on Dec. 6, 1994 when the school board voted to permit a citizen group comprised of local businesses to place boxes of Bibles in the Upshur County Public Schools on Feb. 27, 1995, for students to pick up on a voluntary basis. As a result, on Feb. 23, 1995, the ACLU on behalf of several parents, sued the school and obtained an order forbidding the school from permitting anyone to make Bibles available to students while the case was pending.<br>
The Rutherford Institute asked the court to recognize that a public school's decision to permit outside groups to make free written materials available to students does not violate the Establishment Clause merely because the outside group chooses the Bible as the material to make available.

Gregory P. Gorman, a participating attorney with The Rutherford Institute, represented Welch. <br>
On May 18, 1995, Welch submitted her speech to the school's English Department for grammatical editing. As a result, school officials informed Welch that school policy required her to remove religious references and the words "God" and "Jesus Christ" from her speech. School officials also advised Welch to rewrite her speech.<br>
The Rutherford Institute, on May 21, 1995, hand delivered opinion letters to the school board, superintendent and principal, informing them that they were violating Welch's constitutionally guaranteed free speech rights by forcing her to remove religious references from her speech.

<p><b>Retreat or Reform? Russia's Struggle for Democracy,</b> by Robert Halfon<br>
<i>Occasional Paper No. 62,</I> Institute for European Defence and Strategic Studies
<p>Robert Halfon, director of research at Market Access International, a leading public affairs consultancy in the UK, points out that the re-emergence of hardline communism as a significant political force is a matter of great concern. He suggests that the real danger lies in the way in which Vladimir Zhirinovsky and his Liberal Democratic party justify Russian "sabre-rattling" in Iraq and the former Yugoslavia, for the purpose of intimidating the West into accepting policies which may prove detrimental to its interests. Halfon cites the military-industrial complex and the former KGB leaders as other areas where communists still present an obstacle to liberalization. Therefore, the author concludes, western democracies have a crucial role to play in identifying and promoting Russian democratic groups and leaders and encouraging their political programs. 50 pp. CONTACT: The Institute for European Defence and Strategic Studies, St. George's House, 14/17 Wells Street, London, ENGLAND, W1P 3FP, 0171/637-2152, or fax 0171/637-2155.

<p><b>Spending Wisely, Not Just More: What Does a 21st Century Defense Require?,</b> by Philip Gold<br>
<i>Inquiry April 1995,</i> The Discovery Institute
<p>Philip Gold, a Discovery Institute Senior Fellow and director of their Aerospace 2010 project, analyzes the spending habits of the military establishment since the end of the Cold War. This paper questions the ability of the military to deal effectively with the New World disorder, in light of recent cutbacks. Gold also explores why increased spending will be necessary in certain technological areas. The author argues that, in the long run, the proper course is not to spend more but to spend more wisely.

<p><b>The Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act: Helping to Create a Free and Prosperous Cuba,</b> by Bryan T. Johnson<br>
<i>Issue Bulletin No. 208,</i> The Heritage Foundation
<p>Policy Analyst Bryan Johnson examines the possible effects of the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act, which is currently before the Senate. He encourages the Senate to take this opportunity to strengthen the bill which passed the House by including several measures: 1) strengthen the provision prohibiting international financial institutions from providing loans and guarantees to Castro's Cuba; 2) create a provision designating as a hostile act any move by Castro to unleash a mass exodus of illegal emigrants; 3) restore Cuba's share of US sugar import quotas to near its 1958 level once Castro is gone and a democratic transition government is in place; 4) eliminate language authorizing the President to provide government-subsidized financing and other programs to a post-Castro Cuba; 5) direct the President to seek a free trade area agreement with a post-Castro Cuba; and 6) require that the President begin processing the 25,000 refugees at Guantanamo for controlled entry into the US. Johnson proposes that these measures will tighten the existing embargo and help end Castro's 40 year nightmare in Cuba. 10 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 565, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail 74157.372@compuserve.com.

<p><b>NATO and US Interests, </b>by W. Bruce Weinrod<br>
<i>Commonsense, Vol. 2 No. 1,</i> National Policy Forum
<p>W. Bruce Weinrod, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for European and NATO Policy in the Bush administration, outlines and addresses the serious questions being raised about the relevance and future of NATO. As the United States and its European allies enter a new era in international politics, NATO must decide how its role and membership reflect this new era. Weinrod writes, "The best way for NATO to help assure a Europe 'whole and free' is to bring the democratic nations of Europe closer to NATO, with the objective of making them members." In order to clarify these decisions for NATO, the US must first clarify many of the foggy points of its own foreign policy, and the current administration must be willing to exert its leadership over this process. 13 pp. CONTACT: National Policy Forum, 229<P8M><$E1/2><P255D> Pennsylvania Ave., SE, Washington, DC 20003, 202/544-2900.

<p><b>Do We Need the IMF and the World Bank?,</b> by Sir Alan Walters<br>
<i>Current Controversies No. 10,</i> The Institute of Economic Affairs
<p>Before embarking on any new initiatives for either the IMF or the World Bank, Walters suggests, these two powerful institutions are overdue for a performance re-examination. Walters, having formerly served as an economic advisor to the Prime Minister, points out that attempts to downsize the Fund and the Bank always end up making them larger. The author also acknowledges that both institutions, besides outgrowing their original purposes, have become increasingly political particularly in the case of Russia, where normal conditions have been relaxed. Walters concludes, "ideally the Bank and the Fund should be abolished. If central banks want a central bankers' bank they (not governments) should control it."

<p><b>About-Turn in Hungarian Foreign Policy,1990-1994, </b>by Ivn Bba<br>
<i>Occasional Paper No. 2,</i> Windsor Klub
<p>Once known as the Happiest Barracks in the Camp, Hungary did more than any other ex-Warsaw Pact state after 1989 to undo the legacy of the international order created by the Cold War. Guided by the statesmanlike vision of Prime Minister Jzsef Antall, Hungarian foreign policy between 1990 and 1994 consistently pursued the aims of Euro-Atlantic integration and regional co-operation. Despite the break-up of no less than three neighboring countries (Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and the Soviet Union), Hungary remained an important source of stability and pro-Western resolve. In this study, the deputy state secretary at the foreign ministry for these years assesses the successes and failures of his country's policies and considers the impact that last year's electoral victory by the Socialist Party will have on Hungary's acceding to such institutions as NATO and the EU. 29 pp. CONTACT: Johnathan Sunley, Windsor Klub, Falk Miksa utca 12.I.1a, Budapest 1055, HUNGARY, 361/112-3701

<p><h3><i>Commerce, Infrastructure and Regulation</h3></i>

<p><b>Red Tape In America: Stories From The Front Line,</b> by Craig E. Richardson and Geoff C. Ziebart, The Heritage Foundation
<p>The Heritage Foundation's report on American bureaucracy reveals the horror stories that result from a regulatory system that has become not merely ineffective but harmful. This study begins by reviewing the general impact of government regulation and then examines specific federal agencies and statutes. Among these are the Food and Drug Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Endangered Species Act, the Internal Revenue Service, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Americans with Disability Act, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The cases documented in this report provide irrefutable proof of the degree to which government regulation has harmed both individuals and businesses, stifling creativity and the entrepreneurial spirit. 110 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 565, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail 74157.372@compuserve.com.

<p><b>Fixing the Roads: A Blueprint for Michigan Transportation Infrastructure Policy,</B> by John C. Taylor<br>
The Mackinac Center for Public Policy 
<p>This comprehensive analysis of Michigan's transportation argues that policy makers must fundamentally reinvent the planning, funding, construction, and maintenance procedures for the state's roads. The federal government returns to Michigan about half the revenues the state sends to Washington from the federal fuel tax. The author projects a savings of over $170 million in the state's department of transportation budget if the state adopted various reforms, including more privatization, tort reform, and relaxation of unrealistic environmental regulations. This study will prove useful to transportation analysts in most other states, as well. 40 pp. CONTACT: Mackinac Center for Public Policy, 119 Ashman St., P.O.

<p><b>The Minimum Wage: No Way to Help the Poor,</b> by Deepak Lal<br>
<i>Occasional Paper 95,</i> The Institute of Economic Affairs
<p>Deepak Lal, a professor of International Development Studies at UCLA, examines the controversy among economists about the effects of a minimum wage. Despite the many recent studies which apparently support the views of politicians in Britain and the US, minimum wages would have widespread effects on labor markets: they would, for example, reduce human capital formations because they would compress the wage structure and undermine incentives to acquire skills. Thus, support for a minimum wage is "at odds with the desire to promote skill accumulation by unskilled workers particularly the young and females. The author suggests that those who fear a situation where workers do not properly market their skills should still be wary of the minimum wage since "there is not obvious technocratic solution which would be better than that discovered by the market." 38 pp. CONTACT: Institute of Economic Affairs, 2 Lord North St., London, England  SW1P 3LB, 071/799-3745.

<p><b>A Higher Standard of Living in Right-to Work States,</b> by James T. Bennett<br>
National Institute for Labor Relations Research
<p>James Bennett's study reveals that residents of Right-to-Work states have higher real incomes on average than the residents of states where workers are forced to pay union dues. In his report Bennett shows that after adjusting for state and local taxes and inflation, the average family in a Right-to-Work state has $2,852 more in purchasing power than a family in a forced-unionism state. The author writes, "In states without Right-to-Work laws high taxes and the high cost of living erode the purchasing power of income so much that families in states with Right-to-Work laws are, on average, better off." This study compares 1993 state and local taxes, as well as the cost of living, in those metropolitan areas in Right-to-Work states to those in forced-unionism states. 12 pp. CONTACT: National Institute for Labor Relations Research, 8001 Braddock Rd., Suite 510, Springfield, VA 22160, 703/321-9606, fax 703/321-7342.

<p><b>The Urgent Need to Finish Farm Trade Reform,</b> by Thomas J. Duesterberg<br>
<i>Hudson Briefing Paper No. 177,</i> Hudson Institute 
<p>Senior Fellow and Director of the Competitiveness Center Thomas Duesterberg demonstrates that the developing world is experiencing a tremendous growth in demand for bulk foodstuffs and processed foods, as the economies of these countries continue to prosper. Duesterberg forecasts that the US agricultural industry is one of the few in the world that can meet this growing demand in an environmentally friendly way. Despite considerable obstacles in much of the developing world including outright bans on many Asian countries, severe restraints, and high tariffs US agricultural exports achieved record sales in 1994. This paper concludes that the US, in order to take advantage of the coming increase in worldwide food demand, must unshackle US producers, and US trade negotiators must take aggressive steps to remove barriers to worldwide trade in bulk and processed agricultural products. 12 pp. CONTACT: Hudson Institute, Herman Kahn Center, P.O.

<p><b>Redesigning CERCLA Liability: An Analysis of the Issues,</b> by Kathleen Segerson<br>
Policy Study No. 187, Reason Foundation
<p>This policy study, prepared by University of Connecticut economics professor Kathleen Segerson, examines reform options for Superfund liability. Segerson explores strict liability, joint and several liability, and retroactive liability as they function in current Superfund law and suggests that the present system does not allocate risks and costs effectively or fairly. She concludes that in cases of retroactive application, strict liability should be eliminated and a negligence-based rule should be adopted for both care and mitigation; and in cases of prospective application, strict liability should be retained, and joint and several liability should be eliminated, except when the parties have a contractual relationship. 20 pp. CONTACT: Reason Foundation, 3415 S.

<p><b>A Report Card on the Pressler Telecommunications Plan (S. 652),</b> by Adam D. Thierer<br>
<i>Issue Bulletin No. 209,</i> The Heritage Foundation
<p>Adam Thierer, Walker Fellow in Economic Policy examines why the leading telecommunications deregulation bill in the Senate misses the opportunity to benefit consumers by opening the industry to real competition. This paper explains that the Senate must make several major changes to the current bill, since it currently does not address several issues: some elements of the destructive Cable Act will remain in effect; foreign ownership rules are relaxed only for a portion of US industry and could be enforced retroactively after repeal; no serious effort is made to eliminate the FCC or specific bureaus of the agency; no serious reform of the electromagnetic radio spectrum to encourage increased wireless competition; and the current bill maintains and expands telecommunications entitlements that discourage industry competition. 17 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 565, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail 74157.372@compuserve.com.

<p><h3><i>Taxation and Budget</h3></i>

<b><p>Jobs, Growth, Freedom and Fairness: Why America Needs a Flat Tax,</b> by Daniel J. Mitchell<br>
<i>Backgrounder No. 1035,</i> The Heritage Foundation
<p>The Armey flat tax proposal has been wildly popular with American taxpayers, not only due to its simplicity but also because of its fairness and potential for producing economic growth. But many taxpayers are not aware of other positive effects of the flat tax: 1) the flat tax would boost national wealth by $1 trillion, since investments would be guided by profitability rather than tax status. 2) a flat tax would treat people equally, no longer penalizing taxpayers based on success or income. 3) Armey's plan would end micromanagement and political favoritism, ridding the tax code of all deduction, loopholes, credits, and special preferences. 4) the flat tax would increase civil liberties by increasing the rights of a taxpayer under IRS investigation. 5) the flat tax would increase tax collections from the wealthy, since the proposal includes incentives to earn and report taxable income. Mitchell concludes that the most important benefit from the flat tax proposal is the reduction of the power of the federal government in taxpayers' lives and businesses. 35 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 565, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail 74157.372@compuserve.com.

<p><b>Who Really Gains from the Capital Gains Tax?,</b> by Alan Reynolds<br>
<i>Hudson Briefing Paper No. 175,</i> Hudson Institute
<p>Director of Economic Research Alan Reynolds demonstrates why the capital gains tax is an extremely inefficient method of raising revenue. Reynolds claims that  the capital gains tax is easy to avoid, and reporting and monitoring costs are high. The paper reveals that an even worse effect is that the tax decreases the market value of investments and real estate and hinders the economy's allocation of capital assets to their most effective uses. The paper contends that reducing the captial gains tax to to no more than 15 percent, and indexing the basis, would make many people better off (particularly workers) without making anyone worse off. 16 pp. CONTACT: The Hudson Institute, Herman Kahn Center, P.O.

<p><b>Why You Can't Trust the IRS,</b> by Daniel J. Pilla<br>
Policy Analysis No. 222, Cato Institute
<p>Daniel Pilla, a tax litigation consultant, forecasts that some 40 million Americans will have had an adversarial confrontation with the IRS by the end of this year. In a rising number of cases, the taxpayer is right, and the IRS is wrong. This study finds that despite a doubling of its budget over the past 10 years and a nearly 20 percent increase in enforcement personnel, the IRS is increasingly incapable of administering and enforcing the nation's tax law. This report cites several reasons the IRS can no longer be trusted, including: 1) the IRS telephone taxpayer assistance program provides about 8.5 million Americans the wrong answers to even the most basic inquiries about tax laws; 2) this year roughly 10 million Americans will receive correction notices from the IRS assessing about $4 billion in fines and penalties about half of these notices will be wrong; 3) about 40 percent of the revenues the IRS collects through penalty assessments are abated when citizens challenge the penalties in 1993 taxpayers were overcharged $5 billion; and 4) a General Accounting Office audit of the IRS in 1993 found widespread evidence of financial malfeasance and gross negligence; the IRS could not account for 64 percent of its congressional appropriation. Pilla reasons that since the IRS fails to meet the standards of financial accountability that it imposes on the citizenry, it can no longer be trusted with the authority to police American businesses and taxpayers. 32 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Ave., NW, Washington, DC  20001, 202/842-0200.

<p><b>The Coming Taxpayer Bailout of Social Security,</b> by Gary and Aldona Robbins<br>
<i>IPI Policy Report No. 130,</i> The Institute for Policy Innovation
<p>This study argues that the disappearance of the Social Security Trust fund is due to two factors. First, the US economy has performed more poorly than expected. The last recession, combined with expectations of slower future growth, has caused almost one-quarter of the payroll tax base to evaporate. Second, the Social Security program is making promises it cannot keep, committing to replacing about 42 percent of the average worker's salary in retirement, as contrasted with the one-third of salary replacement promised during Social Security's first three decades. Meanwhile, Medicare benefits are also growing at an even more alarming rate. The authors point out that the revenues necessary to support this rapid growth in Social Security and Medicare will claim almost 15 percent of the US economy within the next 35 years, giving the federal government even greater control over the productive resources of Americans than it already has. The report states that the only way to secure the retirement of the baby boomers is to boost US economic growth and slow the rate of benefit growth. 24 pp. CONTACT: The Institute for Policy Innovation, 25 South Stemmons, Suite 306, Lewisville, TX  75057, 214/219-0811.

<p><b>The Pension Funds Bail-Out: The Biggest Boondoggle Ever,</B> by Steven Plaut<br>
<i>Policy View No. 12,</i> The Shalem Center
<p>Plaut, a professor of Business Administration and Economics at the University of Haifa, analyses the Israeli government's proposed bail-out of the Histadrut Labor Federation's collapsed pension funds and how to solve the problem. Plaut asserts that passage of the deal would be an unprecedented blow to the Israeli economy: the price tag is estimated at $33 billion, about 40 percent of Israel's annual GDP. This is roughly 15 times the size (proportionally) of the American saving and loan bailout of the 1980s. This study shows that the worst part of the bail-out is the plan's inability to address the causes of the crisis. The bail-out leaves the management of the pension funds in the hands of the very people who oversaw the creation of the present actuarial deficits. It does nothing to change the monopolistic, uncompetitive structure of the pension industry in Israel, nor does it address the lack of independent supervision of the pension industry. Plaut recommends that free entry and competition should be allowed among pension plans; issuing subsidized government bonds to the pension funds must end at once; actuarial solvency must be made mandatory, and an independent supervisory body must be established to shut down plans not in compliance. 17 pp. CONTACT: The Shalem Center National Policy Institute, 5 Eliash St., Jerusalem, ISRAEL, 02/254-185, or fax 02/256-720. 

<p><b>Excise Tax and Economic Growth in Indiana,</b> by John E. Berthoud<br>
Alexis de Tocqueville Institution, May 1995 
<p>This paper examines the ramifications of excise taxes for Indiana. John Berthoud, Adjunct Scholar at the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution, outlines the role of excise taxes in the state budget and questions the economic consequences on Indiana. Berthoud discusses why, despite the myth that excise taxes are "painless," they cause states such as Indiana substantial and widespread economic harm. Berthoud concludes, "While it is crucial to keep taxes on productive activity such as work and investment low, because of the dangers of cross-border activity, it is also critical to keep excise taxes low." 26 pp. CONTACT: The Alexis de Tocqueville Institution, 2000 15th Street North, Suite 501, Arlington, Virginia 22201, 703/351-4969, fax 703/351-0090.

<p><b>The Case for  "Strings-Attached" Welfare Reform,</b> by Robert Rector<br>
<i>The Heritage Lectures No. 524,</i> The Heritage Foundation
<p>In his address to the Eighteenth Annual Resource Bank  Meeting in Philadelphia, Heritage Senior Policy Analyst Robert Rector discusses the proper relationship between the welfare state and federalism. Rector warns that while many want to move the welfare bureaucracy out of the hands of Washington, the welfare bureaucracy in the states is even larger and more entrenched. This lecture describes the costs and benefits of several different types of welfare reform currently under consideration and analyzes them based on their ability to reduce the welfare system. Rector concludes that "Conservatives at the federal level must unite with conservatives at the state level and surround the liberal bureaucracy and attack it from two directions at once, pushing conservative policies both at the federal level and at the state level." 5 pp.  CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 565, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail 74157.372@compuserve.com.

<p><b>Integrated Systems in Frontier Health Care Delivery: The Unique Needs of Wyoming,</b> 
edited by Sheryl R. Fox and Alexander T. Hunt<br>
The Center for Strategic and International Studies
<p>This report provides an overview of frontier health care delivery issues from varying perspectives and suggests possible technological and structural solutions to reform health care delivery systems in rural and frontier states. Specifically, the report examines the potential for telemedicine to improve rural health care systems and assesses both the economic implications of telemedicine for health care providers as well as obstacles to its implementation. Contributors raise several key points: First, national health care reform, by its very nature, will be anti-rural, transferring rural wealth to urban areas through whatever taxes are used to extend coverage to the uninsured. Second, in reforming health care, states like Wyoming will most likely need to develop networks based on providers to maximize access to health services. Third, telemedicine, the transmission of image and data via communications technology used by health care providers for treatment, diagnosis, and education of patients irrespective of distance, offers a way to bridge the health care gap in frontier states. This report is the summary of the CSIS Health Care Forum Series. 39 pp. CONTACT: The Center for Strategic and International Studies, 1800 K St., NW, Suite 400, Washington, DC  20006, 202/887-0200.

<b><p>Pursuing the Trivium: The Association of Classical and Christian Schools, </b>

<i>Philanthropy, Culture, & Society,</i> April 1995 
<p>Gene Edward Veith, Dean of Arts and Sciences at Concordia University, compares the value of the education provides by schools focused on the trivium (grammar, logic, and rhetoric) versus the current education acquired in American public schools. Veith describes the work of Idaho Minister Douglas Wilson who has founded a network of private schools: The Association of Classical and Christian Schools. This paper describes an ineffective public school system which has been dumbed down and focuses on the importance of teaching students to think for themselves and communicate effectively, with a sound background in the classics. 7 pp. CONTACT: Capital Research Center, 727 15th Street, NW, Suite 800, Washington, DC 20005, 202/393-2600.

<p><b>Medical Savings Accounts: A Building Block for Sound Health Care,</b> by Stephen Barchet<br>
The Evergreen Freedom Foundation
<p>Stephen Barchet, chairman of the Washington Medical Savings Account Project, presents his findings from a study to evaluate whether Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs) are a viable health care alternative. The study was completed through on-site investigations of companies using MSAs, and their research revealed the following facts: 1) reduced health care expenditures to both the sponsor/employer and employees; 2) wiser use of health services by consumers; 3) greater use of preventative services; 4) increased consumer involvement in health care decisions and purchases; and 5) strong employee participation and satisfaction. Barchet also finds that the sick and poor are better served than in many "managed-care" programs, since they have the same access to health care as everyone else. This study confirms that people controlling their own health care dollars with MSAs do not need huge central bureaucracies to make intimate health care decisions for them. MSAs allow patient choice, high quality medical service, and lower spending all of the benefits government plans promise without the costly, inefficient invasion of a centrally run bureaucracy. 54 pp. CONTACT: The Evergreen Freedom Foundation, P.O.

<p><b>SSI: The Black Hole of the Welfare State,</b> by Christopher M. Wright<br>
<i>Policy Analysis No. 224,</i> Cato Institute
<p>Christopher Wright examines why the current reforms of the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program fall far short of the dramatic overhaul that the open-ended entitlement program needs. The author states that the ultimate goal should be to privatize disability insurance programs. In the meantime, any serious attempts to reform the system, according to Wright, should include the following: 1) ending automatic cost-of-living adjustments; 2) eliminating retroactive lump sum payments; 3) abolishing all SSI assistance to drug addicts and alcoholics; 4) establishing an enrollment cap for SSI. This study concludes that unless the program's costs are brought under control, by the year 2000 SSI will be larger than Aid to Families with Dependent Children, food stamps, subsidized housing, the earned income tax credit, and all other forms of public assistance except Medicaid. Major reform, and ultimately privatization, are needed to rein in this costly and corrupt entitlement program. 35 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20001, 202/842-0200.

<p><b>Bridging the Gap: Strategies to Promote Self-Sufficiency Among Low Income Americans</b><br>
National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise
<p>This report is the compilation of the recommendations of the Neighborhood Leadership Task Force on Grassroots Alternatives for Public Policy. This task force breaks new ground, bringing to the fore people who have demonstrated that they know how to reduce violence, reduce teen pregnancy, and provide compassionate care for children. This report call for a departure in the way America administers its social welfare programs, stating that what most poor people want are opportunities and responsibilities, not just rights and entitlements. As a result of their findings, the task force has found three principles fundamental to turning the tide of poverty: first, funding and authority for designing and providing services to the poor should be devolved not just from the federal government to the state level, but to the community-based organizations that demonstrate success in dealing with the problems of poverty. Second, individuals and communities must be empowered to create their own solutions through policies that emphasize personal and financial asset development. Third, the present maintenance-focused welfare system must be replaced by policies that promote strong families and emphasize personal responsibility and the development of self-sufficiency. 25 pp. CONTACT: National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, 1367 Connecticut Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20036, 202/331-1103.

<p><b>Government Contracts Reform: A Critical Analysis of the Administration's Proposal, </b>
by Jed L. Babbin and Thomas Earl Patton<br>
<i>Critical Legal Issues: Working Paper Series No. 63,</i> Washington Legal Foundation
<p>This working paper argues that the Clinton Administration's bid protest reform proposal is flawed in its reliance on faulty statistical analysis and its failure to recognize the importance of bid protests in the government procurement process. The authors demonstrate how the flaws in the data underlying the administration's recommendations include overstatement of the number of contract awards actually protested and exaggeration of the amount of time protested contracts are delayed. This paper claims that the Administration's opposition to these recommendations overlooks the General Services board of Contract Appeals process, which allows judges dealing with a complex information technology protest to be experienced in technical issues, providing a suspension mechanism to compel and agency to stop performance of the contract during the protest period. The authors suggest some solutions to bid protest problems, including the imposition of liability for frivolous protests, disallowing protest costs for protests that are not granted in their overhead pools, and requiring alternative dispute resolution before proceeding with protests to the General Services Board of Contract Appeals or the General Accounting Office. 23 pp. CONTACT: Washington Legal Foundation, 2009 Massachusetts Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20036, 202/588-0302.

<p><b>The Case for Fundamental Tort Reform,</b> by Michael J. Horowitz<br>
<i>Hudson Briefing Paper No. 176,</i> Hudson Institute
<p>Horowitz maintains that the lawyers' monopoly of access to the courts allows them to impose a 33.33 to 40 percent toll charge on all damage recoveries, even in cases in which defendants are willing to pay on a rapid, no-dispute basis. Contingency fees, the near-uniform means of compensating tort claim attorneys, can provide risk-free windfall of profits to lawyers while harming defendants, plaintiffs, and the economy as a whole. Horowitz demonstrates that true reform of the US tort system should include early offer reforms, which seek to ensure the settlement of large numbers of cases before expensive trials and pretrial proceedings, and contingency fee reform, which protects clients from having to pay their attorneys windfall fees far out of proportion to the work performed and the risks assumed in taking a case. 8 pp. CONTACT: The Hudson Institute, Herman Kahn Center, P.O.

<p><b>A Citizens Guide to Lawsuit Abuse,</b> by James Gattuso and Joe Rubin<br>
<i>Citizens for a Sound Economy,</i> April 1995. 
<p>This guide to lawsuit abuse chronicles the effects of lawsuit abuse in everyday life, revealing products that are not available to consumers and higher prices directly due to companies' fears of lawsuits. This report points out that despite the enormous costs of lawsuits, most of the costs are not even delivered to victims, but rather more the half the costs goes to lawyers.

<p><b>Punitive Damages: Once Is Enough,</b> by Richard J. Mahoney<br>
<i>Occasional Paper 150,</i> Center for the Study of American Business
<p>Richard Mahoney, a distinguished executive in residence at the Center for the Study of American Business, states that, under certain limited conditions, granting punitive damages can have merit. However, the author warns, the current practice of allowing punitive damages to be awarded over and over again to different plaintiffs against the same defendant for essentially the same issues is illogical. Mahoney presents the results of an informal survey conducted among a large group of American firms: a representative group of 43 large corporations reported that in the past five years a total of $4.4 billion was involved in settlements driven by punitive damages. Mahoney suggests the most practical answer available is legislation at the federal level, like the Hatch bill, that would forbid the repeated award of punitive damages for the same issue. In addition, in order to protect potential claimants against a single punitive award foreclosing a later, larger amount, judges would be empowered to permit punitive damages a second time if the first award was held to be an "insufficient deterrent." 14 pp. CONTACT: Center for the Study of American Business, Washington University, Campus Box 1208, One Brooking Drive, St. Louis, MO 63130-4899, 314/935-5682.

<p><b>The 1995 Crime Bills: Is the GOP the Party of Liberty and Limited Government?, </b>
by Jarett B. Decker<br>
<i>Policy Analysis No. 229,</i> Cato Institute
<p>Attorney Jarett B. Decker asserts that everyday crime that disrupts American life is largely a local problem, best handled by state and local law enforcement agencies. Despite this, Congress has become increasingly involved in fighting crime on a federal level, in order to be perceived as being active on the issue of crime. Decker states that the 1995 GOP crime bills introduced in the House and Senate promise more of the same, but with unprecedented provisions what would threaten freedom and undermine the fair administration of justice: the Senate bill includes a provision that would exempt federal prosecutors from the rules of legal ethics; both the Senate and House crime bills would enable federal agents to invade homes, raid businesses, and conduct humiliating body searches without legal justification, while reaping the benefits of evidence collected through such illegal searches; and the Senate bill would enable federal agents to detain citizens, hold them incommunicado, interrogate them for day, weeks or months, and use any of their statements in any subsequent prosecution. 41 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20001, 202/842-0200.

<i>Backgrounder No. 1034,</i> The Heritage Foundation
<p>Heritage Congressional Analyst Dan Greenberg states that, despite the initial cutbacks imposed on the Congress by the new Republican leadership, further steps are necessary to reduce perks, reform pensions, and further trim staff. This paper cites several problems with these initial reforms: 1) automatic pay raises are still scheduled each year; 2) Congressional pensions far exceed most private sector plans and benefits exceed those of most other federal employees; 3) taxpayer-funded mailings, travel, and other perks are abused to promote incumbents' reelection bids; and 4) Congress remains the most heavily staffed legislature in the world.

<b><p>INSTITUTE FOR JUSTICE
<p>New Jersey Family Cap Found Constitutional</b><br>
On May 4, 1995, a federal judge ruled in favor of New Jersey's family cap welfare reform experiment.  The lawsuit filed in 1993 by Legal Services of New Jersey and others had asked the judge to block the cap and vacate the federal waiver that permitted it, on the grounds that the federal waiver was unlawful and the reform violated procedural and consitutional rights. The judge stated in his decision that the cap "does not violate any statutory or constitutional mandate," thus upholding the validity of the federal waiver and the program. 
The Institute for Justice filed an amicus brief on behalf of American Legislative Exchange Council, Independent Women's Forum, The Empowerment Network, and five New Jersey AFDC recipients; and played an active role in defending the program. 17 states are currently pursuing similar programs to reform their welfare systems.

<p><b>Institute Challenges Barriers to Interracial Adoption</b ><br>
On April 13, 1995, the Institute for Justice launched a nationwide challenge to "race matching" by state agencies to establish a rule of law that racial discrimination in adoptions is unconstitutional. Its first two test cases are in Texas and Tennessee. In Austin, Texas, the Institute filed a class action lawsuit against the Texas Department of Protective and Regulatory Services, the agency charged with protecting abandoned and neglected children. In Memphis, Tennessee, the Institute joins as co-counsel in an ongoing federal class action, Reisman v. Tennessee Dept. of Human Services. In Reisman, the plaintiff class of minority children in the custody of the Tennessee Department of Human Services challenges the use of racial classifications in the adoptive placement process.

In an order released on May 8, federal judge William B. Bryant denied the government's motion to dismiss a constitutional challenge to the Davis-Bacon Act, filed by the Institute for Justice on behalf of minority contractors and public housing tenant groups on the ground that the law is racially discriminatory. The law, which requires "prevailing wages" on nearly all federal contracts, was passed in 1931 and aimed at restricting minority entrepreneurs and workers from competing with mainly white construction unions. The US Department of Labor, which is defending the law, argued that the law was not enacted for discriminatory purposes and asked the court to dismiss the lawsuit. In a one page order, the court refused to do so, allowing the case to proceed.

<p>Foundation Sues Clinton to Enjoin Strike Order</b><br>
National Right to Work attorneys filed a lawsuit to halt enforcement of a Clinton executive order prohibiting federal contractors from hiring permanent replacement workers during a strke. The order enacted the policies of the so-called "Anti-Striker Replacement" legislation which Congress has twice rejected.
"The President trampled on the rights of workers by unilaterally enacting policies to punish workers who choose to work during a strike. He's sweeping the Constitution under the rug so he can please his Big Labor friends," said National Right to Work Foundation Vice President Timothy McConville.
Attorneys from the Foundation filed the suit in US District Court in Washington, DC, on behalf of Representatives John Doolittle (CA), David Funderburk (NC), Ernest Istook (OK), and Harris Fawell (IL). The complaint charges that by issuing the executive order, President Clinton has usurped the constitutional authority soley vested in the Congress to make laws and regulate commerce.
"Most observers agree the result will be more strikes, McConville said. "Union officials would call any strike they want and win every strike they call as easily as pushing a button. With more strike powers, the union officials will have more power to force workers to pay union dues, busting holes in state Right to Work laws."

<b><p>NEW ENGLAND LEGAL FOUNDATION

<p>NELF Coalition Wins Complete Victory in RI Tidal Land Litigation</b><br>
Four years ago the Rhode Island Supreme Court released an opinion which implied that land ever below the median high tide mark ("tidal land") might be subject to a "public trust." That decision raised the threat that the state might be allowed to charge fees or impose public access requirements for use of such land. Because the commercial heart of Providence is tidal land, the implications of the court's decision on the state's economy were troubling. Title insurance and mortgage for this land became difficult to purchase.
NELF responded to this challenge over the next four years by organizing a coalition of the state's major landowners. The coalition decided that the best way to resolve the uncertainty brought about by the court decision was to initiate a second, test case which would give the court a chance to clarify and, hopefully, minimize the scope of the public trust. NELF helped prepare the test plaintiff's brief and filed its own amicus brief on behalf of a number of major Providence landowners.
The first major development in the case came last year when the state conceded that the most important part of the Providence tidal land, the "cove," was free from trust. Last month the Rhode Island Supreme Court decided the remaining issue, the status of the remaining "harbor line" tidal lands. This final decision is a complete victory landowners. The court held that all land which a landowner has filled out to a legislatively established harbor line becomes completely free from any trust. Downtown Providence's landowners have now been confirmed in the full ownership rights they thought they had possessed all along.
<p><b>Connecticut Court Joins Chorus Striking Down Ban on Phone Companies' Entry into Cable TV</b><br>
In a case in which NELF filved an amicus brief on behalf of the Connecticut Business and Industry Association (CBIA) and the New England Council, the US District Court in Hartford, Connecticut has joined the growing number of federal courts which have struck down the ban on local telephone companies' entering the cable television industry. NELF, CBIA, and the Council argued that the ban violated the first amendment rights of not only the local telephone company, Southern New Telecommunications, but it also unconstitutionally limited the television choices that should be coming available to consumers. As the entertainment and communication industries grown ever closer, NELF intends to work to ensure that local telephone companies can become major sources of innovation and competition in the telecommunications industry.
<p><b>NELF to Enter Massachusetts Employment Sex Harassment Case</b><br>
NELF will file an amicus brief in the Massachusetts Appeals Court supporting the dismissal of an employee's sex harassment case. The case was dismissed because of the plaintiff's failure to have used the comprehensive procedures of the Massachusetts employment discrimination act, Mass. G.L. c. 151B. A Superior Court judge held that this failure precludes her suing her employer on any "corollary claim" arising out of the same facts. In this case that meant that the employee's claims of statutory sexual harassment, violation of equal rights, negligence, breach of contract, and intentional infliction of emotional distress were all barred. the court's reasoning followed closely two Massachusetts Supreme Judiciial Court cases in which NELF was involved last year.

On May 22, the U.S. Supreme Court announced that it would not review the pathbreaking Fourth Circuit decision in favor of WLF's client, a Hispanic student, in his suit against the University of Maryland's black-only scholarship program.  The Court had been urged by the Clinton Administration and more than 60 interest groups and universities to reverse WLF's victory, which calls into question the legality of race-based scholarship programs at public universities across the country.  The suit was part of WLF's effort to oppose government programs that classify citizens by race.

<p><b>WLF Appeals in Challenge to Texas IOLTA Program</b><br>
WLF has asked the Fifth Circuit to strike down Texas's Interest on Lawyers' Trust Accounts (IOLTA) program, which requires attorneys to turn over interest generated by their clients' trust accounts to fund legal services organizations.  In 1992, more than $150 million was raised by IOLTA programs nationwide, nearly $10 million in Texas alone.  WLF argued that the program violates the First Amendment by forcing Texans to associate with political causes with which they disagree and that it violates the Fifth Amendment by taking their property without just compensation.  WLF's suit, now on appeal, was rejected by a federal district judge in January.

<p><b>WLF Supports Virginia Against EPA</b><br>
WLF has filed a brief in the Fourth Circuit supporting Virginia's lawsuit against the EPA over the agency's requirement that Virginia change its rules for standing in its state courts.  The EPA has ordered Virginia to allow third parties the right to obtain judicial review of emissions permit approvals, whether or not the parties would have standing to sue under state law.  The EPA's position, if upheld, would enable groups such as the Sierra Club to impede the expansion or modernization of plants even where the state has given its approval.  WLF argued that Congress never intended the Clean Air Act to require this radical expansion of the availability of third-party standing in state courts.

<b><p>WLF Brief Opposes Racial Gerrymandering</b><br>
WLF, representing Congressman Gary Franks, urged the Supreme Court in Miller v. Johnson to strike down Georgia's redistricting plan on the grounds that it improperly drew lines so as to segregate black and white voters into separate congressional districts.  Under pressure from the Justice Department, the Georgia legislature created a district in 1992 with a strange layout, having uninhabited "land bridges" as little as a mile wide to connect black sections of urban areas.  WLF argued that such racial gerrymandering is unconstitutional and also pointed out that black candidates such as Rep. Franks have won elections in majority-white districts.

<b><p>WLF Urges Court to Recognize Constitutional Limits On Punitive Damages</b><br>
WLF filed a brief in the U.S. Supreme Court arguing that the Court should strike down an Alabama court's $2 million punitive damages award against BMW.

WLF argued that the award, which was 500 times the amount of the economic damage suffered by the car buyer, was clearly excessive and violated due process.<br>

<b>The Return of George Sutherland: Restoring a Jurisprudence of Natural Rights<br>
Hadley Arkes (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1994)
</b>
<P>
   Conventional histories of the Supreme Court
describe George Sutherland, who was seated at the Court from 1922
to 1938, as a mainstay of the "Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse"
 a sinister reactionary whose blunt, ideological dissents were
blindly devoted to business interests but failed to engage or
accept the emerging reality of the New Deal constitutional revolution.
Hadley Arkes's remarkable intellectual history, "The Return
of George Sutherland: Restoring a Jurisprudence of Natural Rights,"
reveals a far more subtle and textured portrait of Sutherland:
a sophisticated political thinker who was able to intellectually
outflank his philosophical adversaries and was willing to follow
the logic of his principles even when they drove him outside of
the respectable opinion of his day. Arkes's book is a compelling
portrait of a life animated by ideas, ideas that inspired Sutherland,
at the age of twenty, to copy paragraphs of natural rights theory
into his commonplace book (one of its pages is reproduced as Arkes's
frontispiece) and, at a more advanced age, to import its abstractions
into the often dry details of the law.     But the law, and the
controversies that it raises, are anything but dry when Arkes
describes them. He discusses a hidden Sutherland, one who led
the fight in the Senate for women's suffrage by making Lincolnesque
arguments about natural rights. On the Court, Sutherland reading
the categorical language of the First Amendment argued that the
Constitution categorically barred Congress from placing any limits
on the freedom of the press. In short, for a reactionary, he was
surprisingly progressive even, in some respects, radical.    
<P>
 Arkes sketches a compelling profile of Sutherland and the philosophical
tradition that he represents, demonstrating how the opinions of
the preRoosevelt Court that are generally held to embody a reactionary,
probusiness agenda turn out to benefit employees and the general
public as much or more than they benefit employers. The Old Court
struck down Arizona's law requiring that 80% of a business's workers
be nativeborn; without Court action, Mike Raich  an Austrian immigrant
 would have been out of a job. Sutherland's opinion, in a case
in which a minimum wage for women (but not for men) was struck
down, permitted women to hold onto their jobs, rather than being
displaced by men legally empowered to work for less money. But
the key to understanding Sutherland's jurisprudence is precisely
that he avoided making judgments of constitutionality on utilitarian
grounds, insisting that a coherent theory of natural rights would
lead to a compelling constitutional vision. Sutherland steadfastly
refused to take judicial notice of the happy coincidence that
his constitutional theories would also benefit the public.   
<P> Arkes, through his examination of Sutherland, makes plain what
the reserved language of Sutherland's judicial opinions are sometimes
only able to hint at: that the intellectual foundations of the
modern welfare state rest only on thin air. The knowledge of the
details of complex commercial enterprises that its regulations
presume are rarely to be found in those who would draft them.
The justice of the benefits and burdens that price regulation
attaches arbitrarily to various activities is difficult to justify
or discern. Arkes's description of Brandeisian jurisprudence,
an almost perfect foil to Sutherland's work, is penetrating, even
withering, especially when Arkes sketches how painfully oblivious
Brandeis is to contrary arguments.
  <P>
   Arkes also demonstrates
how Sutherland's fidelity to the bounded nature of the concepts
and texts judges must work with determines his decisions in the
cases before him. Sutherland's strict attention to the history
and meaning of such terms of constitutional art as "commerce,"
"delegation," and "general welfare" and, more
generally, to the necessary implications of the structure of the
Constitution guards against an interpretive slippage that leads
to unlimited government discretion. His method is a refreshing
change from much constitutional law today, which uses crucially
unmoored concepts like "dignity" to get the Court where
its judges want it to go. A problem with this approach  one which
Sutherland's more formal approach solves  is that, without careful
attention to the meaning and limits of words in the law, they
function much like Rorschach inkblots, revealing more about the
way their witnesses think and what they want to do than anything
else.
<P>
      Arkes's book makes a persuasive case that we need more
of Justice Sutherland's radicalism in the world today  a radicalism
that Arkes sets against both the common law's remnants of sympathy
for regulation as well as its continuation in the modern New Deal
state. It is a radicalism that should find many sympathizers.
Those who are deemed unfit to provide for themselves and for their
families because of the terrifying dangers of unregulated taxicabs,
haircuts, and shoeshine stands  as well as other victims of the
regulatory state would likely be sympathetic to Sutherland's views
that people have natural rights to occupational freedom.  
<P>
   It
is difficult in a brief review to give more than a glimpse of
this powerful book, but its fascinating mixture of political theory
and constitutional law provides an intellectual drama that is
rarely seen in books about the Court. Those who seek a model to
get today's Court back on track and in philosophical trim will
benefit from Arkes's readable study.

<b>They're Back!</b><br> 
The Harvard freshman orientation seminar is back alive and kicking. In 1994 the Heritage Foundation had succeeded in killing it off with its own alternative orientation for freshmen Republicans. Encouraged by the new House leadership, enough freshmen opted for Heritage over Harvard that Ivy League school canceled its event altogether. At the time, it was good riddance. Going to Harvard right after becoming a congressman was always exactly the wrong way to get started, enduring huge doses of goo-goo liberal good government and stern lectures about working together and bi-partisanship right off the bat. But now, in another sign of the return to "normalcy" in Washington and American politics, Harvard is back. The good news is that most Republican freshmen are still staying away: 35 Democrats and six Republicans attended the Harvard event. They heard from such luminaries as former Dole chief of staff Sheila Burke (now the executive dean of the Kennedy School), outgoing Clinton flack and media darling George Stephanopoulos, and former Bush policy advisor Roger Porter who best captured the spirit of the hapless Bush Administration and would allegedly judge applicants for White House policy jobs on the basis of their tennis games. Anyone who learns about Washington from this crew may never recover. The six Republicans who attended, according to a Harvard list, were: Merrill Cook (Utah), James Gibbons (Nevada), Asa Hutchinson (Ark.), Charles Pickering (Mississippi), Joe Pitts (Pennsylvania) and John Sununu (N.H. ). Count it as one strike against them.

<b>Media Bias Revisited</B><br>
A while back we discussed William Powers's maiden effort as <I>The New Republic</I>'s media critic. We complained that liberals who acknowledge the existence of anti-conservative media bias feel that they must simultaneously slam conservatives for having a crude , conspiratorial view of that bias. In fact, we observed, most conservative press critics understand the sociological reasons for media bias and accept that it is generally not deliberate or orchestrated. One of our readers kindly passed along an article  from <I>NR</I>'s special issue on the press (June 21, 1993)  that nicely makes the point. Ted J. Smith III wrote: "In short, by any reasonable standard, the case for widespread bias in reporting has been made. This does not imply, as some members of the press seem to imagine, that journalists have been found guilty of consciously slanting the news to make it conform with their ideological perspectives. While this may occur on occasion, what is more commonand more insidiousis the sort of bias that reflects the  unconscious assumptions of the writer. This emerges in such things as the kind of adjectives he employs, the kind of 'experts' he quotes, the kind of organizations he considers authoritative, and the kind of issues he thinks important." . . . And while we 're on the subject: Brent Bozell's Media Research Center Awards for the worst quotes of 1996 will be out by the end of the week. Our own Kate O'Beirne was one of the judges.

<b>Musical RNC Chairs</b><br>
The race for RNC chairman is getting more crowded. Texas GOP chairman Tom Pauken has announced his candidacy, which is being promoted by the conservative weekly <I>Human Events</I>. Pauken is smart, principled, and in Texas he has successfully knit together the  social and economic wings of the conservative movement. Announcing his candidacy, Pauken said: "Under my leadership the RNC will be a member-driven organization with an increased emphasis on rebuilding the grassroots Reagan coalition of economic and social  conservatives. By reactivating the Reagan coalition as well as forming other coalitions with those who believe in economic liberty, limited government, and the traditional American values that made our country great, the Republican Party will be able to  retain and increase its control of Congress in 1998 and make a unified effort to reclaim the presidency." Also entering the race is ex-RNC co-chair Jeanie Austin, who flirted with the interesting idea of running on a joint ticket with Rep. J. C. Watts, but  Watts declined. Austin will appeal to those convinced the party needs more high-profile women to combat its "gender gap" problem. Austin says that's not why she's running, but noted: "I have devoted a good part of my career in the Republican Party, recruiting women into the party, and getting women elected to office. I think our party needs to pay closer attention to what women are saying, and we need to listen to their ideas and concerns." The Christian Coalition has flagged Pauken, ex-New Hampshire Gov. Steve  Merrill, and California GOP chairman John Herrington as its preferred candidates. At this point the race is wide open, but the RNC insiders who will be doing the voting at the winter meeting on Jan. 17 are likely to favor one of their own, a fellow insider. This certainly spells trouble for Pauken and Merrill.

<b>Cohen-Head</b>
The cabinet pick Republicans should be happiest about (at least from a cynical political perspective) is probably Bill Cohen at Secretary of Defensealthough not for the reasons the Clinton Administration thinks. The bi-partisan bounce Clinton will get from this pick will last about two weeks; as soon as Cohen is confirmed the honeymoon ends. Then Clinton gets to deal with side of Cohen Republicans are so familiar withthat is his unreliable, disloyal side. The <I>Washington Post</I>'s Al Kamen recently provided a run-down of his record: Cohen broke with other Republicans during Watergate to vote to send articles of impeachment against Nixon to the House floor; during the Reagan Administration he constantly undercut the Administration's position on Nicaragua; he was skeptical of the Gulf War and at one point told Bush: "We visited the Kuwaitis, we saw the Kuwaitis, and we realized that Kuwaitis are willing to fightuntil every U.S. soldier has dropped." Cohen reportedly got the job on the strength of his interview with the President. But he has no management experience and beginning today all his cachet with Republicans is shot; Clinton is about to learn the limits of a pleasant conversationalist as Secretary of Defense.

<b>Fourth-Floor, Hardcore</b><br>
Hard-core House conservatives have made a concerted effort to get office space together on the fourth floor of the Cannon House office building, the better to coordinate their strategy in the next session of Congress. Get a load of this: on one corridor of the fourth floor of the Cannon building the line-up is John Hostettler (Ind.), John Shadegg (Ariz.), Tom Coburn (Okla.), Todd Tiahrt (Kan.), Steve Largent (Okla.), Gil Gutknecht (Minn.), Zach Wamp (Tenn.), Walter Jones (N.C.), Mark Souder (Ind.), Steve Stockman (Tex.), Mark Neumann (Wisc.), Jon Christensen (Neb.), John Ensign (Nev.), and, right around the corner, Ed Bryant (Tenn.). Whew! Texas Democrat Lloyd Doggett was briefly angling for space on Cannon's fourth floor, but when he realized who surrounded him he gave it up. Look for New Jersey Democrat Frank Pallone, plopped down in the middle of this right-wing real estate, to begin to look for new accommodations soon too (or maybe he'll convert). The House leadership, not eager to face pressure from the Right, can't like the idea of having all these guys together. Says one House aide: "They're going to post sentries, I think, on either end of the hallway."
<P>
<b>Tidbits and Outrages</b><br>
<I>The Washington Monthly</I> has a soporific reputation. It's concentrated for the last several years on nuts-and-bolts policy analysis - more nuts than bolts, if you ask us. Now the magazine has embarrassed itself by giving its monthly journalism award to Donald Barlett and James Steele for their interminable <I>Philadelphia Inquirer</I> series "America: Who Stole the Dream?" which has now, inevitably, been released as a book. It's been hooted by columnists right and center for its ludicrous and often self-contradictory arguments, its primitive "analysis," and its ignorance of basic economicsthemes that, alas, run through Barlett and Steele's work. <I>The Washington Monthly</I>, however, not only gave B&S an award, but excerpt their book in the same issue. This odd sort of self-dealing appears to be a pattern at the monthly: in his section of the magazine, editor Charlie Peters takes the <I>California Journal</I>'s side in a legal dispute with the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>; later in the magazine, the <I>California Journal</I>'s managing editor has a long article.

<b>The Senate's Only Democratic Committee Chairman</b><br>
Bad news for conservatives in the Senate. Indiana Sen. Dan Coats has decided not to challenge Vermont Senator James Jeffords for chairmanship of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee. The committee has always been a trouble spot, featuring some of the Democrats' most liberal Senators and some of the Republicans' most accommodating members. Retiring "Clueless in Kansas" Sen. Nancy Kassebaum was the last chairman, and with Jeffords taking over for her, if anything, the panel will get worse. Jeffords was the only Republican sponsor of the Clinton health care bill. His AFLCIO rating (45 per cent) is nearly as high as his U.S. Chamber of Commerce rating (55 per cent). In short, he's just the type of legislator who helped make the U.S. Senate a graveyard for House initiatives over the last two years. But disloyalty apparently has its rewardnow he's going to be chairman of one of the Senate's most important committees.

<b>Bias Squared</b><br>
"What every conservative press critic preaches, and almost every reporter denies, is largely true: the mainstream press is liberal," writes William Powers in the cover story of this week's <I>New Republic</I>. ". . . When conservatives huff about the cabal of liberal journalists that is constantly plotting to slant coverage, they are right about the effects but wrong about the cause. There is no plotting at all: liberal bias flows from principles so deeply held they're mostly unconscious." It's nice, we guess, to get another admission of liberal media bias by a non-conservative. But somehow such admissions always come wrapped in layers of condescension. No serious conservative press criticcertainly not L. Brent Bozell and his colleagues at the Media Research Center, perhaps the most prolificmaintains that reporters are "constantly plotting to slant coverage." (Notice, by the way, the pejorative choice of verb, "huff," which is a standard <I>TNR</I> technique for parroting an observation and slamming the observer simultaneously.) Most conservatives think that for a variety of sociological reasons journalists tend to be liberal, and this fact affects their coverage. Evidently Powers agrees. Couldn't he just say that on this point, conservatives are unambiguously right?

<P>
<b>Sin Tax Sins</b><br>
Libertarian <I>Washington Post<I/> columnist James Glassman today defends liquor companies' right to advertise their product. Guardians of the public health, he suggests, ought to try to raise beer taxes instead. He writes that "we don't tax beer nearly enough. Currently, the United States earns"surely he means "takes"?as much in excise taxes from a single bottle of scotch as it does from 39 cans of beer, according to Congressional Budget Office figures." Say it ain't so, Jim! Repeat after us: Beer isn't undertaxed; scotch is overtaxed.

Jeff Rosen's gargantuan cover story in the <I>New Republic</I> on "O.J. Simpson, critical race theory, American law, and the triumph of color over justice" is attracting a lot of attention. Hilton Kramer and Maureen Dowd have both called it "brilliant." We're fans of Rosen, but this time we must demur. The essay's critique of critical race theory is neither novel nor sufficiently pointed. The article's only original insight is the linkage between that theory and the Simpson trial, which is sort of obvious. Finally, his critique is more aesthetic than intellectual or moral. He uses the word "crude" more often than "wrong" to describe arguments. . . . 
<P>
In the same issue, Jacob Heilbrunnthe only person who has identified himself as one of the folks who joined Michael Lind's alleged exodus of intellectuals from the Righthas a shoddier article on "a startling new species: fellow travelers on the right" who apologize for anti-democratic regimes like Lee Kuan Yew's Singapore. Some of the examples are howlers: outgoing Sen. William Cohen ("R.," Me.) can hardly be described as part of the Right. A more glaring weakness is that Heilbrunn's proposed parallelism between the leftist attachment to Marxist regimes and revolutionaries and the right's alleged embrace of "Asian values" ignores the distinctioncentral to conservative foreign-policy thought for a decade and a halfbetween authoritarian and totalitarian regimes. Some conservatives may defend dictatorships on grounds that amount "to a relativistic multiculturalism." But a much older tradition of conservatism looks askance at the notion that there is one best set of political arrangements that works everywherenot because sound values vary from place to place, but because circumstances do. And lastly, Heilbrunn should have noted that plenty of conservatives have criticized Singapore's regime. Its censorship of reporter Christopher Lingle, an incident Heilbrunn mentions, was, for instance, the subject of a story in <I>National Review</I>.

<b>Investment Advice</b><br>
Jim Glassman's "Your Money" column in the Sunday <I>Washington Post</I> focuses on Jim Grant's bearish views. Grant says the stock market has entered its "absurd phase." Yields on dividend-paying stocks have fallen to 2.2 per cent, "even below their level just before the October 1987 crash." The average Standard & Poor p/e ratio recently hit 20, where it was only 15 last year. (Glassman doesn't note that some analysts think structural changes in the economy are raising the trendline p/e ratio.) And then Glassman adds a cute point: "Another danger is that nearly all market advisers think that stocks will keep rising. That's proven to be a negative sign in the past." Grant "believes a decline in the market is imminent, and, if it occurs, investors will not ride it out. They'll sell their funds. Managers will have to dump shares to meet the redemptions, driving prices down further." Glassman thinks, on the other hand, that investors should hold on to their stocks but not buy any new ones.

<b>Boys Will Be Boys</b><br>
For some reason, <I>Washington Times</I> columnist Wesley Pruden delights in sexual slurs against his assorted enemies: "They're not real men" is his constant theme, even when he's discussing women. Normally this is harmless enough. But it takes a particularly ugly twist in today's column, "Trashy talk can have its rewards." Pruden writes, "Only this week a court in Eau Claire, Wis., awarded a 21-year-old man a million dollars for 'pains and slights' suffered at the hands of his high-school chums, who razzed him because he was a homosexual who prefers lads to lassies. Such a deal. An award of a million dollars just to be the butt of a joke is enough to make anyone cheerful, if not gay. This kind of stuff could be catching, and there's even a government agency to make whiners feel good about themselves." Pruden's version of events is misleading on several counts. The award was $900,000; and it was an out-of-court settlement. But the real distortion is his out-of-context use of the phrase "'pains and slights'" and his own words "razzed" and "whiners." The man in this casea boy at the time, let's rememberwasn't just "razzed." He was shoved, spat upon, beaten, and urinated on. He was kicked in the abdomen so many times he required surgery. A good case can be made that awards and settlements shouldn't be this generous. But Pruden doesn't advance that case. Nor does he do a service to those conservatives who harbor moral objections to homosexual behavior and are unjustly accused of vile bigotry.
<P>
<b>Affirmative Distraction</b><br>
The latest <I>New Yorker</I> includes an essay by Alan Wolfe on affirmative action. Like a lot of writing on the subject, it focuses on race preferences to the exclusion of gender preferenceswhich is odd, since the latter is far more significant by many measures. The article has its insights, but it is marred by conceptual confusions and ignorance of the conservative movement. 
<P>
Most of the article is devoted to exploring the alleged implications of corporate America's attachment to racial preferences. He writes that "the right doesn't want to admit that affirmative action has the blessing of the marketplace." "In fact, there are no conservative arguments against the most effective and prevalent forms of affirmative action in America, those implemented by companies." This is, at the very least, muddled. It is simply erroneous to assume that all practices in the private sector are necessarily free-market phenomena: like HMOs, race preferences are at least partly an adaptation to an environment created by the government. Quotas, that is, prevent lawsuits alleging the infringement of state-created "rights." Quite a few conservatives would not have (political) objections to truly voluntary affirmative action, which would be neither required nor encouraged by the government. Clint Bolick, a leading libertarian foe of preferences whom Wolfe never mentions, has said as much; Dinesh D'Souza incorporated an argument along those lines in the conclusion of his much-excoriated <I>The End of Racism</I>.
<P> 
Wolfe's argument becomes slippery when he writes that "conservatives have only two choices: to become liberals if they are to reject affirmative action in the private sector, or to accept such affirmative action if they are to remain conservatives. So why haven't more conservatives endorsed affirmative action? One answer is that a surprising number of them haveor, at least, did. Even the Reagan Administration, for all its professed opposition to affirmative action, adopted the practice of 'race-norming'; that is, raising the scores of minorities on standardized tests to make them more comparable with the scores of whites." He then writes about the Nixon Administration's role in fostering preferences, which he says conservatives don't like to admit. This entire passage is, not to put too fine a point on it, nonsense. The practice of "race-norming" is not the sort of "affirmative action in the private-sector" that conservatives are supposedly obligated to support; and conservatives, who have no love for Nixon's domestic politics, almost always mention his role in the history of race preferences when they write about the subject.
<P> 
Wolfe's thesis collapses at the finish line. "Without governmental enforcement," he writes, "some private companies may indeed drop their enthusiasm for diversity and retreat to 'birds of a feather' hiring policies." If that's the case, how can it be said that affirmative action "has the blessing of the marketplace"? Plenty of conservatives, though not all of us, would have no problem with Wolfe's conclusion that "while it makes sense for government to aspire to color blindness in order to underscore the importance of universality, companies and private universities ought to be free to take race into account for reasons of pluralism." Here is what <I>NR</I> said about the subject in its August 14, 1995 issue: "Conservatives may argue among themselves over whether purely voluntary, private affirmative action should be banned (as adherence to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 would require), but market forces would probably minimize such discrimination once [government regulations encouraging it were eliminated]." Wolfe is clearly the type of liberal who likes to think that ideas that complex never occur to conservatives.

<b>Ominous News</b><br>
American Enterprise Institute pollster Karlyn Bowman isn't sure what to make of the trend, but it appears that public opinion toward government is softening. This could be, she says, a "prosperity effect": people tend to worry less about runaway government during good times. But might it also suggest a general flabbiness in Republicans' pressing the limited-government case these days?
<P>
<b>For Worse</b><br>
The <I>Washington Post</I> Style section today carries a front-page story on a wedding, titled "Every Girl's Dream." That ought to be enough information for our readers to figure out that the wedding concerned pairs two lesbians. (Heterosexual marriages don't warrant Style treatment unless they involve celebrities.) One woman's family plans to attend; the other woman's family is torn between, guess what, love and prejudice. You could, in other words, write the article half-asleep. ABC's <I>20/20</I> did a segment on same-sex marriages, cleverly titled "For Better or Worse," a few weeks ago. ABC at least allowed family members opposed to same-sex marriage to have a say; but of course, none of them were articulate. Under no circumstances is an articulate traditionalist case allowed on the air. Since it looks like the gay-rights side is going to win in a matter of years anyway, why not say conservatives surrender now, and spare ourselves an endless stream of saccharine documentaries?
<P>
<B>Word to the Wise</b><br>
<I>National Review</I> is sponsoring a forum at the Heritage Foundation next Tuesday, 24 p.m., on the politics of abortion. Does the Republican Party's pro-life stance hurt its political prospects, as is often claimed? Ann Stone, head of Republicans for Choice, and Jim Pinkerton will argue that it does and should be changed. Columnist Maggie Gallagher and Frank Cannon, of Lehrman Bell Mueller Cannon, will argue the contrary position. Karlyn Bowman of the American Enterprise Institute will walk us through poll data on the subject. And <I>NR</I>'s own Kate O'Beirne will moderate. Come one, come all.

<B>TNR Notes</B><br>

The latest <I>New Republic</I> includes an inaugural "TRB" column from its new editor, Michael Kelly, fresh from the <I>New Yorker</I>. It's as well written as ever, but more pointed and open in its political position: that of a chastened, centrist liberal. . . . We've had fun with Michael Walzer's effusions in the <I>New Republic</I>'s "The Hard Questions" column before. This week's isn't particularly amusing; it's just daft. Walzer argues that "the right way out of the 'culture wars'" is to provide government funding for groups like the Gay Men's Health Crisis and black Baptist nursery schools, in order to make these institutions as strong as groups like Catholic Charities and Lutheran Social Ministries, the expressions of an older "multiculturalism." Where to begin ticking off the conceptual problems here? Making independent organizations as government-dependent as Catholic Charities is a recipe not for a vibrant civil society but a neutered and standardized one. Moreover, diversity of "religion, ethnicity, race, and region" is not the same as multiculturalism and has never been so considered by its prominent latter-day critics. Catholics never demanded separatist group rights or their own language; Farrakhanites and Hispanic lobbies do. For them to demand state funds is to ask a polity to fund its own dissolution. And lastly, the phrase "culture wars" most importantly denotes conflicts over competing visions of justice, morality, human personhood, and their implications for such practices as abortion. Converting the Federal Government into a large Ford Foundation isn't going to make those conflicts disappear.

<B>The Bi-Partisan Trap</B><br>
Newt Gingrich and Dick Gephardt held a joint press conference over the weekend that was full of talk of reconciliation, and completing the people's work, and bi-partisanship. Which is fine as far as it goes. There is no need for Republicans to be gratuitously partisan or confrontational with the Administration. But Republicans should also keep in mind that President Clinton built his political recovery on smart, well-managed partisan confrontation on the issues of his choosing: Medicare, the balanced budget, the government shut-downs. People hate partisan conflict in theory, but will endorse it in practice as long as it is marshaled against something they oppose (like the Clinton health-care bill back in 1993). Republicans might want to apply this lesson to the President's proposed intervention in Zaire. There is no national interest at stake, nor is it clear what goals U.S. troops would have in a mission there. Over the weekend the Administration had to re-consider the mission when Rwandan refugee began departing refugee camps in Zairewithout U.S. helpto head back to Rwanda; helping them make this trek was one of the goals of the U.S. intervention. The deeper problem in Zaire is that the government there is essentially non-existent, and if any intervention is going to have any long-term impact it will have to involve perilous and difficult "nation building." But that clearly is more than the American people will support; anything less thought is just a band aid. So why are American troops going to Zaire? And why aren't Republicans vocally opposing the idea?

<b>Newt: Should He Stay or Should He Go?</b><br>
	


The hot controversy inside Washington today was sparked by Kate O'Beirne's column in the current issue of <I>National Review</I> suggesting that perhaps it might be in the best interests of the Speaker Gingrich to temporarily step down from his leadership post, and if he did so a good replacement would be Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde. The column made ABC News, the <I>Washington Post</I>, the newspaper <I>Roll Call</I>,  and prompted remarks by Rep. Steve Largent (Okla.) that it might indeed be advisable for Newt to take a hiatus. Feelings against Gingrich do seem to run high among Republican freshmen who feel they were led astray by Gingrich over the last two years (many of them were shot at with bullets with Newt's name on them in the just-completed campaign). Also, the feeling that Gingrich has become a liability runs high among GOP opinion-makers in Washington, but until now has gone unspoken. The Gingrich forces were so worried about the stir that they reportedly called Hyde's office to see if he was collecting 
votes to challenge Gingrich in next week's internal Republican leadership elections. Such a challenge won't be forthcoming from Hyde, or anyone else for that matter. If Gingrich is going to go, he would indeed have to step aside voluntarily. But the Speaker is still in a precarious position. Yesterday liberal Republican Rep. Chris Shay (Conn.) announced he won't vote for Gingrich for Speaker in Januarythe public, official voteif the ethics committee report on Gingrich has not yet been made public. It seems a sensible demandbut, then again, Gingrich allies suggest this will only give Democrats on the committee reason to stall. Whatever happens, it will be a much reduced Speaker Newt Gingrich come the start of the new Congress, and Republicans have to be willing to think about the possibility in a few months of there being no Speaker Gingrich at all.

<b>Spare the Rod</b><br>
	
Conservative activist and strategist Jeff Bell's Parental Rights Amendment, which some social conservatives think of as a silver bullet, was tested in battle in Colorado on Tuesday. It lost, big. Bell explains that the PRA was unable to win any support from Colorado elites, including conservative elites. The Rocky Mountain News, Vincent Carroll, and Bill Armstrong all came out against it. Nobody with authority was willing to counter the canard that the PRA would license child abuse. (Although there really isn't any doubt on that score: previous legal findings of parental rights have had no problems distinguishing between legitimate parental authority and abuse.) Undecided voters tend to break against ballot initiatives; this conservative instinct was mobilized against a conservative reform. Still, Bell isn't too discouraged. He notes that term limits lost its first test, when Washington voters rejected it after a similarly alarmist and misleading campaign. (Washington was supposedly going to lose the benefits of seniority, and then California's delegation would take all its water rights away.) In any case, the point of the PRA campaign is not to win and generate litigation as much as it is to educate the public about the depredations of modern liberalism. The campaign, in other words, is the point. And the campaign continues

<b>NR Washington's Election Predictions</b><br>
	Pundits all around the country are weighing in with their election predictions, here is NR Washington's Stab at Prognostication:
<P>
	The Presidency: Bill Clinton, of course, wins in a walk, but a closer walk than people think. The president will be held below 50 per centprobably the 4748 rangedealing a blow to his plans to claim an election mandate (the press may well give him one anyway). Dole has been closing in recent days thanks to the Indonesian scandals. The word is that Dole internal polls have him within 6 points in California, which he must win if he is going to pull off his electoral-vote inside straight. But it's too late for him to win there. The campaign has also been taking heart from the Reuters/Zogby poll which has Dole down by just 4 point nationally. But most other tracking polls have Clinton up by 9-16 points, and with the President leading in Republican states like Arizona and Florida he is assured a very pleasant election evening. The Senate: Republicans gain two or three seats. Republicans will pick up seats in the South; they will certainly win the open Howell Heflin seat in Alabama, are likely to win the David Pryor seat in Louisiana, and have a chance to win Democratic open seats in Georgia (Republican Guy Millner has pulled even with Max Cleland) and Louisiana (Republican Woody Jenkins is tied with Mary Landrieu). Meanwhile, the only Republican incumbent who will lose is Sen. Larry Pressler who is trailing in South Dakota. Sen. Bob Smith will pull it out in New Hampshire, and Sen. Jesse Helms will be fine in North Carolina. Get ready for some more troops for Trent Lott (and they'll be more conservative too). The House: Republicans lose 5-7 seats tops and could even make some gains. The tide has clearly shifted the Republicans' way at the congressional level, thanks in part to a huge barrage of negative advertising against the Democrats. There are only 10 or so Republican freshmen who seem sure to lose. There are another nearly 30 seats where the Democrats have a chance, but these potential Democratic gains are easily offset by 10 Democratic seats where the GOP seems likely to make pick-ups and another roughly 20 where the Republicans have a chance. When all the dust settles the situation in the House will look much the way it does nowwith one important exception. By early summer, one way or another, Newt Gingrich will no longer be Speaker.

<b>"California Pandering"</b><br>
The <I>New York Times</I>'s latest insult to the intelligence of its readers was Thursday's editorial denouncing California's Proposition 209, the initiative to ban racial and gender preferences in state contracting, employment and university admissions. <I>The Times</I> complains that Bob Dole, "who voted for the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964, and a stream of race-conscious Federal laws since then, could now be heard complaining that all of these efforts, including many he had supported, had turned out to be a 'blind alley.' " We will eat an entire edition of the <I>Times</I> if Mr. Dole can be proved to have repudiated the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Notice also the slippery elision between that act and race-conscious laws that followed: some of the language, and the entire spirit, of Proposition 209 is borrowed from the 1964 act, which was a historic blow against "race consciousness." But it gets worse. The <I>Times</I> blasts Dole for having "tossed around code words like 'preferences' and 'quotas.' " Oh, so these things are figments of the right-wing imagination. (Have you noticed, by the way, that the word "liberal" increasingly appears in quote marks, as in "the 'liberal' Paul Wellstone," as if only a shameless partisan opponent would think to attach that label to moderates like the Senator from Minnesota?) Then we learn that "Proposition 209 is a retrograde measure that would deprive state authorities of what little leverage they have to promote true equality of opportunitya point President Clinton has grasped." These are the depths to which standards of argument have fallen at West 43rd St. Clinton is further congratulated for having "defused an angry national debate over affirmative action" with his " 'mend it, don't end it' policy." In fact, Clinton has done nothing to alter the practice of race and gender preferences, and his Justice Department has tried to extend them. "Mend it, don't end it" is a slogan, not a policy. But perhaps in the Clinton era, the <I>New York Times</I> can't tell the difference. 
<P>
<b>Affirmative Reaction</b><br>
The <I>New York Times</I> is on to something, though. The political battle over the California Civil Rights Initiative has featured a veritable avalanche of sleaze and misinformationall coming from its opponents. Take the new ad campaign against it. One ad features Candace Bergen saying, "If 209 passes, we could lose maternity benefits. . . . 209 will cut funding for rape crisis centers." In another, Bruce Springsteen exhorts the "working men and women" of California to vote against the proposition because it "will legalize discrimination against women and girls in jobs, in education, and in sports." Ellen De Generes's ad makes a bizarre link between the initiative and "the anti-choice boys" of "the religious right." A. Woodard appears in yet another ad quoting Gloria Steinem: "209 could wipe out maternity benefits." All these claims have something in common: they are lies, deliberate and utter fabrications. Bubble-headed Hollywood types may not know any better, but the people who write their lines surely do . The campaign to preserve race and gender preferences ought to be ashamed of itself. Here's hoping California voters won't be fooled. But if they are, it will not be proof that preferences are popular; it will be proof that they can only be sustained by a campaign of vicious demagoguery and simple lies.

<b>Holding The House and Senate?</b>
All right: here's some (possible) good news for a change. As of yet there's no sign of a national Democratic tide that would sweep the party back into control of the Senate and House. Although Republicans are still warily eyeing Clinton's final all-out campaign push, they are encouraged by trends in Senate and House races. In Senate races in Nebraska, Montana, and Iowa Republicans have made big gains in the last week in seats being defended by the Democrats. Presumablyalthough no one can say anything for surethe trend would be the opposite if Clinton were building a national Democratic wave. In the House the trend is similar. The kind of freshmen Democrats will have to beat to regain the majority have built leads over their opponents in recent weeks: Phil English and Jon Fox in Pennsylvania and Bob Ney, Steve Chabot and Steven La Tourette in Ohio. Republicans think a number of factors are working in their favor as the campaign draws to a close. 1) The message that Bill Clinton shouldn't be given a "blank check" with a Democratic Congressthe National Republican Campaign Committee is running ads to this effect in 50 House racesseems to be taking hold. 2) The continuing high-profile Asian fundraising scandal increases uneasiness with Clinton and supports the idea he can't be trusted with a Democratic Congress. 3) The Republican national committees are finally unleashing a tide of spending across the country, the National Rifle Association is kicking in a late $1.5 million independent expenditure, and Republican candidates have tended to save their resources, until now, for the final push. 4) The Christian Coalition will presumably be turning out voters big-time in an election everyone agrees will hinge largely on turn-out. 5) Perot seems to be gaining ground, and if his voters show up at the polls they will tend to vote for GOP congressional candidates. But Republicans should hold their breath until they actually cross the finish line. What they all dread is a smashing Clinton victory in the East, trumpeted by the networks around 8 p.m. eastern-time or so, which keeps Republicans away from the polls everywhere else. If that happens, despite everything, it might be time to start saying "Speaker Gephardt." (Uh, that's the bad news.)

<title>What Is Policy Review -- Heritage</title>
<META name="keyword" content="Policy Review: Journal of American Citizenship, community, conservative, journal, families, family, local, civic, religious, schools, education, citizens">
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<img src="/heritage/revpo.gif" width=169 height=79 alt="Policy Review" border=0></a>
<h2><i>POLICY REVIEW: The Journal of American Citizenship</i></h2></center>
<p>
<i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</i>, the flagship magazine of <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a>, is published 6 times per year. 
<p>
<i>Policy Review</i> specializes in the study of private-sector and local-government alternatives to the bureaucratic, centralized welfare state. We are dedicated to rebuilding the institutions of American citizenship -- families, neighborhoods, religious institutions, public and private schools, voluntary civic institutions, businesses, and local governments.
<p>
<i>Policy Review</i> profiles great American citizens: Houston constable Victor Trevino is reducing crime with his "zebra squad" of volunteer cops; Sister Connie Driscoll is helping young urban mothers in Chicago; <a href="/heritage/p_review/spring95/tolerth.html">Rev. Frank Reid</a>, of Baltimore's AME Church, is promoting black Christian manhood to the members of his community.
<p>
We study "what works": <a href="/heritage/p_review/spring95/glassth.html">DeVry Institute of Technology</a> sets the standard for career training; Rhode Island's privatized school lunch program tastes better and costs less; private security officers reduce crime around New York's Grand Central Station. 
<p>
We tackle tough subjects, and propose common-sense policy prescriptions, for issues such as <a href="/heritage/p_review/fall95/thegg.html">crime</a>, <a href="/heritage/p_review/summer95/thfost.html">taxes</a>, <a href="/heritage/p_review/fall95/thhood.html">environment</a>, <a href="/heritage/p_review/fall95/thfinn.html">education</a>, <a href="/heritage/p_review/fall95/thsher.html">religion and culture</a>, <a href="/heritage/p_review/summer95/thcraig.htm">adoption and foster care</a>, and <a href="/heritage/p_review/summer95/thbear.html">Social Security</a>. We publish articles by influential people on the major issues of the day. Newt Gingrich, Phil Gramm, <a href="/heritage/p_review/summer95/tharmey.html">Dick Armey</a>, Bill Bennett, Ralph Reed, Bill Kristol, Kate O'Beirne, Grover Norquist, and other key policy makers all contribute to <i>Policy Review</i>.
<p>
<i>Policy Review</i> provides practical, constructive thought -- the best of conservatism-in-action.

<b><i><center>1995-96 Information and Application Form</b><br></i>
<hr width=75%><br></center>
<P>
	The Heritage Foundation was founded in 1973 "to formulate and promote conservative public policies based on the principles of free enterprise, limited government, individual freedom, traditional American values, and a strong national defense."   A non-partisan tax-exempt institution, it is now one of the largest and most influential research and educational foundations in the United States, providing national, state, and local decision-makers with information that is concise, timely, and relevant to the current policy debate.<p>

	In the early 1980s Ronald Reagan described Heritage as the "feisty new kid on the block." Today, according to House Speaker Newt Gingrich, "Heritage plays a major role in developing the ideas that are going to make America's success possible in the 21st century."<P>

	Located in the nation's capital, The Heritage Foundation offers both summer and academic year internships.  These programs are intended to introduce bright and innovative undergraduate students to the policy-making process, involve them in the important questions and issues of the day, and encourage them to become active and effective participants in public affairs.<br><center>

It works primarily with the black and Hispanic communities on issues of mutual concern such as welfare reform, crime, revitalizing inner cities, and education reform.  As interns are responsible for research on a variety of issues, writing ability is important.  In addition, interns help plan meetings and luncheons, prepare mass mailings, and attend conferences.  Since interns may be given independent research projects, they must know how to obtain information from multiple sources, and possess good research skills.
<P>
<a name="polrev"></a><p><i><b>Policy Review</b></i> is Heritage's quarterly journal of conservative opinion and debate.  Interns are hired by the Editor to conduct special research projects, such as compiling a list of great conservative quotations or writing a feature article on the world's greatest conservative movies.  A publishing intern is also hired to assist in advertising and distribution.  Interns provide general office support for the editorial staff.  Interns must have a talent for research and writing, and have computer skills.

<b>The Heritage Foundation: Providing Practical Ideas for America's Future</b>
</center>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	As the nation's leading think tank, The Heritage Foundation's impact on public policy is more pronounced than ever. As <I>The Wall 
Street Journal</I> wrote recently, "No policy shop has more clout than the conservative Heritage 
Foundation."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Indeed, many of the 104th Congress' plans for balancing 
the budget and scaling back big government began at Heritage. By providing official Washington 
with timely research and analysis, Heritage has become a primary information source for America's 
lawmakers.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Heritage's people are more than just well-informed and 
well-educated. Many have hands-on government experience. They are doers as well as thinkers.  
Players, not just spectators. 
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	If you need a thought-provoking, articulate expert to 
discuss today's important issues, The Heritage Foundation is the place to turn. Contact 
<a href="mailto:moebiusw@heritage.org">Wanda Moebius</a> at (202) 675-1761 to book a speaker.

Welcome to the Town Hall CyberPersonality site!  I can assure you that this is certainly a new venture for me.  I've heard of "talking heads" from the likes of "Capitol Gang," and what used to be "MacNeil-Lehrer," but an on-line Internet personality is one of newest ways The Heritage Foundation would like to get past the limited amount of media coverage of hot issues and tell you what is really happening in Washington, on Capitol Hill, in the White House, and in policy circles.
<P>
A little bit about me -- I'm <a href="/heritage/cyberbio.html">Karen Czarnecki Miller</a>, and I'm primarily responsible for maintaining contact with the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov">Clinton Administration</a>, educating the presidential campaigns on important policy issues, and overseeing The Heritage Foundation's <a href="/heritage/jobs/jobs.html">Job Bank</a>. I also serve as a spokesman for the Foundation on Heritage proposals and research findings in all areas of the Foundation's study.<p>


I'd like to tell you a little bit about what you can expect to see when you come to this site.  Of course, over the next several months, I'll be doing some fine-tuning to make this as interesting and informative as possible.  I'd like to hear your thoughts on what you'd like to see, and what would help you to keep on top of current issues. 
<p>
Twice a week -- on Tuesday and Friday -- I will be on-line to discuss hot topics on the Hill and elsewhere, and answer your questions.  I am also planning to post research materials, discuss what opinion leaders are saying, interview guests on politics and policy, and much more!  
<p>
What would you like to see? Please <a href="mailto:gabrona@heritage.org">email</a> your thoughts to me, or to <a href="mailto: gabrona@heritage.org">Andy Gabron</a>, who helps me with research
 for this page. I look forward to hearing from you!

Founded in 1973, The Heritage Foundation is a research and educational institute -- a think tank -- whose mission is to formulate and promote conservative public policies based on the principles of free enterprise, limited government, individual freedom, traditional American values, and a strong national defense.
<P>
<A HREF= "/heritage/staff/stafftoc.html">Heritage's  staff</A> pursues this mission by performing timely accurate research addressing key policy 
issues and effectively marketing these findings to its primary audiences: members of Congress, key congressional staff members, policymakers in the executive branch, the nation's news media, and the academic and policy communities. Heritage's products include publications, articles, lectures, conferences, and meetings.
<P>
Governed by an independent Board of Trustees,The Heritage Foundation is a non-partisan, tax exempt institution. Heritage relies on the private financial support of the general public -- individuals, foundations, and corporations -- for its income, and accepts no government funds and performs no contract work. Heritage is one of the nation's largest public policy research organization. More than 200,000 contributors make it the most broadly supported in America.

&quot;Transactional Politics&quot;</CENTER>

<P>Just by going about their highly difficult business, President Clinton
and Speaker Gingrich have been redefining campaigns and coalition-management.
Out of improvisation and intuition, they are trying things that might --
I would say should -- become a model for elected officials generally.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Everyone knows how a politician in search of power goes about making commitments,
implicit or explicit, to his or her natural constituencies, in the hopes
that all of them add up to a majority on election day. When the commitment-making
is blatant (Walter Mondale in 1984) or merely clumsy (George Bush in 1992),
the candidate is assaulted by the other party for &quot;pandering.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
So far, so normal. But consider what signals are sent to the profession:
All candidates, from their first race on, are conditioned to see the commitment
game as a tightrope to be walked. Don't lean too far either way. Don't seem
aloof, but neither should you appear overobligated. Be loyal to your &quot;base&quot;
-- without becoming &quot;owned&quot; by these same voters' lobby groups.
Keep your options open in Washington -- but beware winding up with no one
who will fight to re-elect you at home.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Most voters see through the above balancing act, and many politicians become
exhausted by it -- that's the bad news. The good news is that Messrs. Clinton
and Gingrich -- fellow baby-boomers and master orators who imagine they
can convince anyone of anything -- have been developing a new set of tools
for riding herd on to their respective partisan coalitions. I call it transactional
leadership -- a sort of &quot;share the risk&quot; public deal-making that
emulates the norms of private life.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Consider a typical marriage in trouble. The husband is silent, morose, and
sick of being asked to share his feelings. The wife has therefore taken
to overstressing hers, and becoming both more needy and more bitter. One
public couple -- Michael and Kitty Dukakis -- played out this mirror-imagery
in the late 1980s. He was the rock, she was the hailstorm -- but, under
presidential-campaign pressure, each tendency made the other worse. Like
political forces, the two &quot;parties&quot; in a marriage can get dug
in at extremes that end up shriveling their union's productive &quot;center.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Now consider a partnership, perhaps in real estate or law. Office footage
is being cut in half, so is the client-base, and the next year looks to
be a long dark trough. The partners can dig in and make demands, or they
can reach out and enlist this crisis of survival for some kind of longer-term
win/win. The partners could all commit to go six months without salary,
plowing all new revenue into (a) paying the unavoidable bills and (b) advertising
and other business-development. In short, share the risk -- and prove your
staying power.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
What the marriage crisis needs is this: &quot;I'll take the risk of reforming
if you take a risk and make some of your own needed changes. We will suffer
differently, but together, and in a hopeful direction.&quot; The business
example is one of going back to &quot;sweat equity,&quot; as if the partners
are starting the enterprise from scratch, by taking a blood oath to recapitalize
and build for the future.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Now ask yourself: Does anything like that ever happen in the public phase
of politics? Forget the backstage favor-swapping and vote-trading among
individual legislators -- I'm talking about a top political figure proposing
a public transaction, to part of his electoral coalition, so a political
risk can be shared on the way to eliminating it. Technically this is not
a straight &quot;deal,&quot; but more of a negotiation begun while everyone
watches. The leader says: I'm willing to take the heat [for the group this
audience represents] on an unpopular vote. And I expect you to change your
act, and image, over the next two years so we don't have to bleed again
in the next Congress.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Of all national leaders, Newt Gingrich is the only one I see doing this
with gusto. I first witnessed it as his deputy press-secretary in September
1978, when President Jimmy Carter and a heavily Democratic 96th Congress
were pushing national price controls on hospitals. All the Georgia medical
groups expected Newt, about to win the first election, to fight his home-state
President's bill. And he said he would -- but he also told the Atlanta AMA,
point-blank, that they faced ultimate NATIONALIZATION if they stuck with
business-as-usual and ignored middle-class fears about profiteering and
bureaucracies. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It was great: A candidate telling his own supporters they can count on him
only so far. And beyond that? Get real, folks. Get serious about your own
survival in a democracy where the debate never stops.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Fifteen years later, during the first version of his famed &quot;Renewal&quot;
course, Gingrich did something similar. He told both the FDA and the AMA
-- the latter still an ally, the former a growing &quot;enemy&quot; -- to
work toward reform according to the same unifying principle. Listen to how
Newt phrases it:<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Guess what, gang? An awful lot of what the<B> </B>AMA is about is
a medieval guild: It is setting up government required rules that only if
you go through THIS school, pass THIS board, and are accepted by THIS group,
will we certify you. Now I don't think we should say, 'You want to do brain
surgery like Jethro on<I> The Beverly Hillbillies,</I> show up Tuesday...'
There ARE things you want certified; [but] I do think -- whether it's hospitals,
drugs, doctors or the Food &amp; Drug Administration -- there is a lot of
potential FLEXIBILITY in delivering things, and we need more pragmatism
and less credentials.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Thus spoke Newt, in November 1993, at Kennesaw State. The very same month,
to a quite different audience but one vital to his survival, Bill Clinton
also talked candidly. In Memphis, after a dazzling account of Martin Luther
King, middle-class black progress and urban mayhem, the President told a
vast assembly of black ministers: &quot;We have to make a partnership --
all the government agencies, all the business folks. But where there are
no families, where there is no order, where there is no hope, where we are
reducing the size of armed services because we have won the Cold War, who
will be there to give structure, discipline, and love to these children.
You must do that and we must help you.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
At that moment, Clinton was leading the coalition that passed NAFTA. He
had just surprised Republican free-traders by enlisting most of the large
environmental groups. A re-elected George Bush could never have brought
these groups into the free-trade fold, and the way Clinton pulled it off
(with those so-called &quot;side agreements&quot;) amounted to competent
coalition-juggling -- and fairly public too. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
During his '92 campaign, Clinton had proposed a &quot;New Covenant,&quot;
under which different types of responsibility would become the price for
continued government support. His party, running Congress during 1993-94,
did not go along. Ironically, those Republicans who aren't ideologically
opposed to activist government -- chief among them Speaker Gingrich -- COULD
go along with the Clinton's 1992 themes as well as his Memphis framework.
So? Look for the New Covenant to come back in '96 with a different name.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Certain U.S. Presidents (JFK and LBJ occasionally, Teddy Roosevelt all the
time) have put forth sweeping proposals -- &quot;deals&quot; in the national
interest -- to groups inside their own political tent. Doing so acknowledges
the latter's influence -- while forcing them to use at least some of it
for a non-selfish purpose.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Contrast that with today's Republican candidates for President -- the people
who expect to replace Clinton and become Gingrich's main ally. They trudge
before all the hot groups -- gun-owners, medical interests, tobacco farmers,
Perot conventioneers -- and hand out plates of red meat festooned with iron-clad
pledges. FOR WHAT? No one, not even a habitual horse-trader like Phil Gramm,
so much as hints that these single-issue or self-righteous voter blocs owe
him, or the country, anything back. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Well, Mr. Would-Be President and Guardian of the National Interest, if you
are too much of a weenie to suggest something exalted, everyone watching
on C-SPAN assumes you require only the petty: PAC money and petitions and
buses for election day.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Especially today, more national officials need to notch down their interest-group
checkmarking and try out the Gingrich/Clinton model: BE real in your major
addresses, and GET real with some of your otherwise demanding audiences.
Float a deal -- not a petty one, but exalting: &quot;I will stick my neck
out for you here, but I expect a helping hand to transform this issue afterward,
for America.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Guess what? Whoever sees this play out whole will be reassured. After all,
national cynicism is so thick that few believe a candidate acts on altruism
or principle anyway. We assume their &quot;no strings attached&quot; pledge
is supposed to be rewarded, <I>sub rosa</I> and backstage, by money or access
later. Wouldn't it be far healthier to see our political leaders TRADE the
risks they take for some compatible restraint or innovation from the interest
groups each one has to work with? Bill Clinton did so to save NAFTA, and
Newt Gingrich is already refining this creatively &quot;transactional&quot;
leadership model for the great Medicare struggle. More leverage to him.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H4>THE proposition that human beings are created in the image of God is
one of the bedrock principles on which Western civilization was built. Its
influence can be detected in most, if not all, of the West's greatest achievements,
including representative democracy, human rights, free enterprise, and progress
in the arts and sciences.<BR>
<BR>
Yet a little over a century ago, this cardinal idea came under wholesale
attack by intellectuals drawing on the discoveries of modern science. Debunking
the traditional conceptions of both God and man, thinkers such as Charles
Darwin, Karl Marx, and Sigmund Freud portrayed human beings not as eternal
and accountable beings, but as animals or machines who inhabited a universe
ruled by chance and whose behavior and very thoughts were dictated by the
unbending forces of biology, chemistry, and environment. This materialistic
conception of reality eventually infected virtually every area of our culture,
from politics and economics to literature and music.<BR>
<BR>
The cultural consequences of this triumph of materialism were devastating.
Materialists denied the existence of objective standards binding on all
cultures, claiming that environment dictates our moral beliefs. Such moral
relativism was uncritically adopted by much of the social sciences, and
it still undergirds much of modern economics, political science, psychology
and sociology. <BR>
<BR>
Materialists also undermined personal responsibility by asserting that human
thoughts and behaviors are dictated by our biology and environment. The
results can be seen in modern approaches to criminal justice, product liability,
and welfare. In the materialist scheme of things, everyone is a victim and
no one can be held accountable for his or her actions.<BR>
<BR>
Finally, materialism spawned a virulent strain of utopianism. Thinking they
could engineer the perfect society through the application of scientific
knowledge, materialist reformers advocated coercive government programs
that falsely promised to create heaven on earth.<BR>
<BR>
Discovery Institute's <A HREF="crsc.html">Center for the Renewal of Science
and Culture</A> seeks nothing less than the overthrow of materialism and
its damning cultural legacies. Bringing together <A HREF="crscfellows.html">leading
scholars from the natural sciences </A>and those from the humanities and
social sciences, <A HREF="crscarts.html">the Center explores how new developments
in biology, physics and cognitive science</A> raise serious doubts about
scientific materialism and have re-opened the case for the supernatural.
The Center awards fellowships for original research, holds conferences,
and briefs policymakers about the opportunities for life after materialism.
<BR>
<BR>
The Center is directed by Discovery Senior Fellow Dr. <A HREF="meyer.html">Stephen
Meyer</A>. An Associate Professor of Philosophy at Whitworth College, Dr.
Meyer holds a Ph.D. in the History and Philosophy of Science from Cambridge
University. He formerly worked as a geophysicist for the Atlantic Richfield
Company.</H4>

Discovery Institute Press Release August 10, 1996</H5>
<H1><CENTER><BR>
<BR>
Major grants help establish <A HREF="crsc.html">Center for Renewal of Science
and Culture</A><BR>
<IMG SRC="trubluln.gif" WIDTH="600" HEIGHT="12" ALIGN="MIDDLE" NATURALSIZEFLAG=

</H1>
<B>For over a century, Western science has been influenced by the idea that
God is either dead or irrelevant. Two foundations recently awarded Discovery
Institute nearly a million dollars in grants to examine and confront this
materialistic bias in science, law, and the humanities. The grants will
be used to establish the Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture at
Discovery, which will award research fellowships to scholars, hold conferences,
and disseminate research findings among opinionmakers and the general public.
</B><BR>
<BR>
Heading the Center will be <A HREF="meyer.html">Discovery Senior Fellow
Stephen Meyer</A>. An associate professor of philosophy at Whitworth College,
Meyer did his doctoral studies in origin-of-life biology at Cambridge University
and is an associate editor of the scientific journal Origins and Design
. The Center's co-director will be <A HREF="jwestbio.html">Discovery Senior
Fellow John West</A>, asst. professor of political science at Seattle Pacific
University. West oversees Discovery's <A HREF="religion.html">Religion,
Liberty &amp; Civic Life</A> program. <BR>
<BR>
Working with Meyer and West will be an array of scholars and advisors from
around the world, including Phillip Johnson, professor of law at the University
of California, Berkeley, and author of <I>Darwin on Trial</I> (1992) and
<I>Reason in the Balance</I> (1995), and chemistry professor Michael Behe,
author of the much-anticipated <I>Darwin's Black Box</I>, on sale now at
major bookstores.<BR>
<BR>
Ina addition, the Center will award several full-time research fellowships
each year. For 1996-97, the full-time Discovery research fellows will be
William Dembski, Paul Nelson and Jonathan Wells. Dr. Dembski has a long
history of mathematical study at University of Chicago, Cornell and MIT
and is a fundamental contributor in the fields of chance, chaos, probability
and randomness theory. Currently, Dembski is completing a second doctorate
in philosophy. Nelson is in the final weeks of his Ph.D. program in philosophy
of science, also at the University of Chicago, and is the editor of the
scientific journal Origins and Design. Dr. Wells holds doctorates in molecular
and cell biology from UC Berkeley and religious studies from Yale University.
He is the author of the book Charles Hodge's Critique of Darwinism.<BR>
<BR>
The new Center grew out of last summer's <B>&quot;Death of Materialism&quot;</B>
conference that Discovery organized and which has gathered increased attention
since the four keynote addresses were published by the Intercollegiate Review
earlier this year.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The conference pointed the way,&quot; Discovery President Bruce Chapman
says, &quot;and helped us mobilize support to attack the scientific argument
for the 20th century's ideology of materialism and the host of social 'isms'
that attend it.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Crucial, start-up funding has come from Fieldstead &amp; Company, and the
Stewardship Foundation which also awarded a grant. <BR>
<BR>
The Center for Renewal of Science and Culture fits well with Discovery's
existing programs in high technology and religion. <A HREF="gilder.html">George
Gilder</A>, who heads Discovery's technology program, has a long-standing
interest in the interaction of science and culture. The end of his book
<I>Microcosm</I> explores the social and spiritual implications of contemporary
physics, another one of his works-in-process deals with the cultural necessity
of faith.

<H3>The Looming Crisis</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Is your financial future at risk? Do you worry that your stnadard
of living is threatened? Does it concern you that for the first time in
America's history young adults today do not believe they will exceed the
achievements of their parents' generation?<BR>
<BR>
If you answered yes you are not alone. Millions of us -- Baby Boomers and
Gen Xers -- have lost faith in America's twin promises of retirment security.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>Saving Social Security</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Some people think we can shore up the failing Social Security
system by pouring billions more tax dollars into a system basically unchanged
since President Roosevelt introduced in in 1935. Others say it should be
scrapped altogether, that we should break the promises ratified by every
US President since Roosevelt.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>The Mission</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Economic Security 2000 is committed to reviving the Roosevelet
committment to retirment security and restoring economic opportunity to
millioins of Americans, many workings tow and three jobs without getting
ahead.<BR>
<BR>
We have time to transform Social Security, but we must act quickly -- before
the year 2000. America's third cnetury can be an era of security, ownership,
growth, savings, investment, and unprecedented prosperity.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H4>Economic Security 2000 presents a blueprint for restoring the American
Dream. This is your call to action. Together let's begin a national debate.<BR>
<BR>
We cannot continue a pay-as-you-go Social Security System that will require
staggering tax increases and huge cuts in benefits.<BR>
<BR>
We cannton abandon Social Security and Roosevelt promise of a safety net
for retirees, non-wage earners, and the disabled.<BR>
<BR>
Let's take the sensible approach and capitalize the system and save Social
Security.</H4>

<P>Suppose you are 20 years old and earning $10,000 a year. You and your
employer are paying $1,240 a year in Social Security taxes. That's 12.4
percent of your hard-earned income, for benefits that you will never see.
<BR>
<BR>
Suppose instead you could invest that same $1,240, as well as an additional
$2.50 a week. By the time you are 65, thanks to the magic of compound interest,
you would be a millionaire. You would be assured a comfortable retirement.
<BR>
<BR>
This isn't a game-show fantasy. This isn't a lottery jackpot. It is a realistic
goal. But unlocking this economic opportunity means revolutionizing Social
Security. Every American who earns $10,000 a year or more can become a millionaire
over the course of one working lifetime&oacute;45 years. By the year 2000,
there will be over 100 million Americans who fall in this category. <BR>
<BR>
In a recent survey, Americans between the ages of 18 and 34 reported they
are more likely to see a UFO (46 percent) than their Social Security benefits
(28 percent). They're right. The Social Security trust fund starts running
out of money, under current projections, in the year 2013. If you're 20
today, that's when you turn 38. By the year 2030, when you turn 55, the
fund will be short $200 billion a year and be unable to meet one quarter
of its obligations. By the year 2042, when you turn 67 and reach your so-called
normal retirement age, the fund will have an accumulated debt of $4.7 trillion.
I'm not making this up. This isn't science fiction. These numbers come from
the 1994 report of the trustees of the Social Security system. <BR>
<BR>
You could get all your benefits, of course, if there were an enormous tax
increase for your children and grandchildren. According to the Social Security
trustees, honoring existing promises for Social Security and Medicare benefits
will require a rise in payroll taxes from the current level of 15.3 percent
to 25.7 percent in 2030. But that simply isn't going to happen. Americans
are already overtaxed. Do you think they'll put up with 25 percent payroll
taxes, and federal income taxes, plus state and local taxes on top of that?
<BR>
<BR>
Some politicians will tell you not to worry: Social Security is building
up a big trust fund that will take care of all those promises. By the end
of this year, the trust fund will have $475 billion in assets&oacute;on
paper. By 2020, there will be $3 trillion on paper. The trouble is, when
the program needs the money, the money will already have been spent on everything
the federal government spends money on. To redeem its IOUs to the trust
fund, the federal government will have to borrow money or raise taxes&oacute;by
over $36,000 per family&oacute;just as if the trust fund had no assets at
all. <BR>
<BR>
So you and your employer are now paying one eighth of your income to pay
for the Social Security benefits of current retirees, and to build up an
illusory trust fund. Meanwhile, your own retirement is in jeopardy. <BR>
<BR>
No wonder younger Americans fear they are on a treadmill. No wonder there
is so much trepidation about the future of the country. No wonder we have
a savings crisis: our savings are being spent. No wonder most Americans
now say their children will enjoy less opportunity than they do. <BR>
<BR>
It doesn't have to be this way. Social Security can be saved without raising
taxes, and without lowering the benefits or cost-of-living adjustments of
existing retirees. Social Security can be saved in a way that will open
up opportunity for younger people&oacute;so that their standard of living
will be better than that of their parents and grandparents. If we use the
principles of democratic capitalism to reform Social Security, the 20-year-old
making the minimum wage can become a millionaire by the time he or she retires.
<BR>
<BR>
Most Americans are on a treadmill because they have but one source of income:
wages. The way to get ahead is to earn income from capital. Money makes
money. With capital, you can retire in comfort and bequeath a nest egg to
your children. <BR>
<BR>
Here is the beauty of capitalism. Any American currently earning $12,580
or more pays $30 a week, or $1,560 a year, into Social Security. Imagine
that, beginning at age 20, you invest that $30 a week at market rates. When
you retire, you'll be a millionaire. Whoever earns at least the minimum
wage can become a millionaire in 45 years. <BR>
<BR>
The secret is compound interest. Let's assume a long-term return on your
investments of 8 percent a year. (This is a prudent assumption; the annual
return on the Standard & Poor's 500 over the past 70 years, including the
Great Depression, is actually 10.19 percent.) If you can save $30 a week
($1,560 a year), after 10 years the value of your portfolio is $29,000.
After 20 years, it is $110,000. After 30 years, it is $318,000. Forty years&oacute;$822,000.
And 45 years&oacute;the normal working lifetime&oacute;$1.3 million. After
50 years, if you work until age 70, the value of your portfolio crescendoes
to an estimated $2 million. <BR>
<BR>
You wouldn't exactly be a millionaire in today's dollars. If we adjust for
inflation of about 4 percent a year, your portfolio of $1.3 million after
45 years would be closer to $230,000. That's still a larger nest egg than
most working Americans even dream of. With that amount of capital, you could
purchase an annuity at age 65 that would give you $18,256 a year (in today's
dollars) during your retirement years. <BR>
<BR>
The way to save Social Security is to make the magic of compound interest
work for its beneficiaries. I've been developing a proposal that will save
Social Security&oacute;and enable 100 million Americans to become millionaires.
The plan keeps Social Security as a mandatory, redistributive savings program,
but it converts the program from the current pay-as-you-go system to a funded
system, in which individuals own retirement portfolios at Social Security
and choose private investment managers. Individuals would be allowed to
set aside portions of their Social Security payments, together with additional
voluntary contributions, in their own personal accounts. They could use
their accounts for retirement income and pass on the capital tax free to
their children. The plan has four basic elements: <BR>
<BR>
Pay existing obligations to all current retirees. Social Security benefits
would be paid to all existing retirees, as promised, without changes, and
without reductions. <BR>
<BR>
Divide Social Security into two tiers. If you are working now, you and your
employer would continue to pay existing Social Security taxes of 12.4 percent
on the first $61,200 of your income. Some of that would go to pay the benefits
of existing recipients. Some of your payments would go into your own personal
account. Payroll taxes would not rise from their current level. They would
be cut by 2 percentage points around the year 2040. <BR>
<BR>
The benefits of current retirees would be paid out of the first tier&oacute;current
payroll taxes. When they retire, current workers would draw benefits from
two Social Security sources: income from future payroll taxes and income
from their personal retirement accounts. <BR>
<BR>
Create personal investment and retirement accounts for the second tier of
Social Security. Every worker who earns at least $4,000 would have his own
IRA-like account with Social Security. (Unlike an IRA, you could use your
account only for retirement, and could not withdraw from it earlier.) The
first $500 that you and your employer pay into Social Security every year
would be automatically deposited in your personal retirement account. You
could increase the deposit in your personal retirement account by up to
$3,000 per year by making voluntary contributions that would be matched
by Social Security taxes you are already paying. The size of the match would
vary according to income. <BR>
<BR>
Here's an example: If you earn $10,000 a year and you contribute $1,240
per year, the first $500 of this money would be paid into your personal
account. If you add a savings match of $130, the Social Security program
will deposit an additional $610 of tax money you are already paying into
the fund into your personal retirement account, for a total of $1,240 per
year. In 45 years, your portfolio will be $1,026,524 and you're a millionaire.
<BR>
<BR>
If you are making $50,000, you might wish to put the maximum of $3,000 per
year into your personal account at Social Security; $1,500 of the $3,000
comes from taxes you are already paying, and $1,500 comes from additional
funds you save from your income, that is, from a personal-savings match.
In 45 years, your portfolio would be $2.5 million. <BR>
<BR>
This money would be in your name, you would own it, and you would be in
charge of picking an investment manager to invest it for you. Social Security
would set up a corporation whose only purpose is to certify and approve
private-sector money managers. (Criteria would include performance and experience
in money management, years in business, and certfiably good character.)
You would pick your investment manager from this list, and could switch
to a different one any time you wanted. This sort of system is already working
well in Chile. <BR>
<BR>
Use your capital account to increase your retirement income, and pass on
your assets tax free to your children. When you retire, you would have two
attractive choices of what to do with your capital account. One would be
to use income from your capital (5 percent a year) for your retirement benefits&oacute;and
then, when you die, to pass on your entire capital account tax free to your
children or heirs. The second would be to purchase an annuity with your
capital account, and receive higher retirement benefits during your lifetime
but not pass any assets on to your children or heirs. <BR>
<BR>
Based on current life-expectancy charts, when you reach 65 you can expect
to live, on average, to age 83, an additional 18 years. With an annuity
you could currently receive an estimated 7.9 percent return per year. <BR>
<BR>
If you have a small portfolio when you retire, your Social Security benefits
would be paid as promised out of the income from your capital (5 percent
a year), as well as payroll taxes from future workers. Suppose, for instance,
you have $100,000 in your personal account, and promised Social Security
benefits of $10,000 a year. You would receive $5,000 in Social Security
income from your capital, and $5,000 through the regular payroll-tax base.
When you die, you would then be able to pass your retirement assets on to
your children or heirs. <BR>
<BR>
As portfolios grow through compound interest, however, tens of millions
of retirees would have the opportunity to increase their benefits. Twenty-year-olds
today earning $10,000 a year will retire at age 65 in 2040. If the wages
keep up with expected inflation, their final wages will be $15,236. Their
promised present-law Social Security benefits will be $9,121 per year (a
59.9 percent replacement level). If payroll taxes are not increased, Social
Security benefits would be reduced 24.4 percent&oacute;from $9,121 to $6,892
per year. <BR>
<BR>
Under the Beard system, these retirees would have $1,026,524 in their personal
accounts with Social Security ($182,769 in today's money). If they choose
an annuity, their Social Security benefits will be $14,511 per year&oacute;$5,390
higher than present-law Social Security promises. If they wish to pass the
$1,026,524 tax free onto their children or heirs, their benefits will be
$9,138. <BR>
<BR>
It would be enormously expensive to move from a pay-as-you-go to a funded
Social Security system. Annual deposits into personal capital accounts would
begin at over $100 billion per year and climb to over $200 billion per year
(in today's dollars) by 2040. And this would be in addition to the massive
deficits already projected for Social Security beginning in 2013. How can
America possibly afford these expenses? The money would come from five sources.
<BR>
<BR>
Over time, the largest increase in Social Security revenue would come from
the income of the new capital accounts. By 2040, after 45 years in operation,
the estimated value of retirees' capital accounts in today's dollars would
be $8 trillion, almost double the current value of the private pension system.
If we assume 5 percent income from capital to pay retirement benefits, retirees
would receive over $400 billion every year from their capital (in today's
dollars). <BR>
<BR>
Social Security payroll taxes currently exceed payments by about $25 billion
a year. This surplus would go into the personal capital accounts. So would
the $475 billion in assets that have supposedly accumulated in the Social
Security trust fund. Those assets don't really exist, but workers have paid
extra taxes on the federal government's promise that the surplus would go
to a trust fund. Amortized over 20 years, the trust fund could be drawn
down at the rate of $30 billion a year. In practice, this will mean that
other federal expenditures will have to be cut by the same amount, bonds
of $30 billion will have to sold to the public, or taxes will have to be
raised by $30 billion. <BR>
<BR>
Some $60 billion a year would be saved through a special debt instrument
we call the Liberty Bond. The Liberty Bond would be a voluntary 30-year
interest-paying instrument. After 30 years, heirs and designees would receive
principal and interest tax free. It would be marketed to retirees who do
not need all their benefits to enjoy a comfortable retirement, and would
gladly forego some of their benefits if they were sure this would help their
children. <BR>
<BR>
I anticipate that five to 10 million Americans would purchase Liberty Bonds.
Millions of retirees would gladly set aside $1,000 per year to create a
$25,000 tax-free education fund for their children and grandchildren. Many
would even set aside their full benefits&oacute;$10,000 to $15,000 a year
for their remaining lifetime&oacute;to build a nest egg for their children.
The government could create a cap of $95 billion per year on the sale of
Liberty Bonds, so that no more money is deferred than necessary. <BR>
<BR>
To make the numbers work, benefits will also have to be reduced for future
retirees. There are two fair ways to do this. One is to raise the normal
retirement age from the current 67 to 70, a change that can be phased in
gradually. We are all living longer and we are in better health as we age.
It is fair to extend the normal retirement age as our own lifetimes are
extended. And in any case, with individual capital accounts in Social Security
and the power of compound interest, Americans will want to work longer&oacute;because
they'll have the opportunity to build up even larger nest eggs. <BR>
<BR>
The second way to reduce Social Security benefits fairly is to reduce indexation
for real wage growth. It is important to index Social Security for inflation.
Once you retire, the cost of living continues to rise as a result of inflation.
Without cost-of-living adjustments, the purchasing power of your benefits
will decrease an estimated 4 percent per year. But Social Security is indexed
again for real wage growth&oacute;about 1 percent a year. This is icing
on the cake for retirees. It is not necessary, and it could be reduced by
50 percent. <BR>
<BR>
The current pay-as-you-go system is an economic, political, and cultural
dead end. It will force us to raise taxes, and then raise taxes again to
pay promised benefits, or to cut benefits and then cut benefits again to
avoid mammoth tax increases. It will create no new capital opportunities.
It will drain a growing amount of America's resources&oacute;our savings
and investment&oacute;out of the private sector. A shrinking private sector
damages our ability to create new jobs and new industries&oacute;our future
strength. <BR>
<BR>
The current system is also a recipe for conflict. If America is a shrinking
pie, the young generation and older generation will fight over the crumbs.
<BR>
<BR>
Under a funded, two-tier system, we would cut payroll taxes 2 percentage
points in 2040 and then cut them again. As the system matures, we would
increase retirement benefits by 25 to 35 percent. We would create 100 million
millionaires. We would amass unprecedented savings and investment in America
by opening the doors of capital ownership to most Americans. We would create
a capital pool that no other nation in the world can equal, and use this
investment to finance the high-paying jobs and new industries of tomorrow.
<BR>
<BR>
By making every American a capitalist, a funded Social Security system would
unleash new economic growth, raise the standard of living of our children,
and return America to its historic role as the country of tomorrow, with
its best days yet to come. <BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Discovery Institute fellows submit their analysis and proposals
for dialogue through seminars, conferences, and debates; they produce reports,
articles, books, Congressional testimony, films and an interactive Internet
website that helps spread the knowledge of the Institute's idea. They also
consult with elected and appointive officials, business people, academics,
media and the general public to show how 21st century humanity can benefit
from the principles, policies, and practices advocated by the Institute.<BR>
<BR>
The point of view Discovery brings to its work includes a belief in God-given
reason and the permanency of human nature; the principles of representative
democracy and public service expounded by the American Founders; free market
economics domestically and internationally; the social requirement to balance
personal liberty with reposnsibility; the spirit of voluntarism crucial
to civil society; the continuing validity of American international leadership;
and the potential of science and technology to promote an improved future
for individuals, families and communities.<BR>
<BR>
<A HREF="fellows.html">Fellows</A>, members, board, advisors and staff of
Discovery constitute a distributive public policy community, connected through
cyberspace, with headquarters in Seattle and an office in Washington, D.C.
Fellows are multi-disciplinary in background and approach. A research and
advocacy project is selected when it is in harmony with Discovery's mission,
when the Institute can make an original and significant contribution to
the issue's development and when it is within the Insitute's resources.
Most <A HREF="current.html">issues selected</A> are of national or international
scope and fall in the fields of science, technology, environment and economy,
international affairs, culture, defense, legal reform, religion and public
life, transportation, and institutions of reprsentative democracy, as well
as bi-national cooperation in the international Cascadia region.<BR>
<BR>
Financially, the institute is a non-profit educational foundation funded
by philanthropic foundation grants, corporate and individual contributions
and the dues of institute members. </B></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><CENTER>WILL THE INTERNET COLLAPSE? NO WAY!</CENTER>
</H3>
What is all this commotion in Massachusetts? The very source of the Arpanet
at Bolt, Beranek &amp; Newman--the cradle of the Internet--Massachusetts
is falling to the forces of Auntie Spiker and Aunt Sponge.<BR>
<BR>
These are the mingy ladies in the Roald Dahl story who rejoiced in James's
Giant Peach as long as it didn't take flight. Now Massachusetts--the state
that once barred Apple shares as a likely West Coast levitation scam--looks
askance at the Giant Peach of the Internet, aloft in Silicon Valley and
around the globe, with James Clark, James Gosling, Netscape and a series
of thin-air IPOs.<BR>
<BR>
Howard Anderson of Boston's Yankee Group, long an Internet tout, thinks
those wired yahoos on Wall Street and Sand Hill Road are blind to the inevitable
sine waves of advance: What goes up must come down, he sternly avers, trying
to bring some simple physics to the scene, as if the Internet has to obey
the law of gravity.<BR>
<BR>
And now Bob Metcalfe--Metcalfe himself!--inventor of Ethernet, pioneer of
Arpanet and the founding father of the networking era. Here he is, prophesying
lugubriously into every megaphone he can grasp, from the New York Times
Magazine and PBS to U.S. News &amp; World Report and InfoWorld, that the
Internet will collapse in 1996. Metcalfe now predicts a general retreat
to Intranets, shielded from the public system and unavailable to it.<BR>
<BR>
Metcalfe was striking a blow against the very solar plexus of my prophecies.
I had founded my confidence in the Internet on the continuing power of the
law of the telecosm, an edict adapted from Metcalfe's very own law of networks.
Metcalfe's Law ordains that the value of a network rises by the square of
the number of terminals attached to it.<BR>
<BR>
In its most basic form, this law merely captures the exponential rise in
the value of any network device, such as a telephone, with the rise in the
number of other such devices reachable by it. Metcalfe, however, shrewdly
added in the declining cost of Ethernet adapters and other network gear
as the Net expanded. In the law of the telecosm, I summed up these and other
learning-curve factors by incorporating into Metcalfe's Law the law of the
microcosm.<BR>
<BR>
Based on the power-delay product in semiconductors, the law of the microcosm
ordains that the cost-effectiveness of the terminals will rise by the square
of the number of additional transistors integrated on a single chip. Amplified
by the law of the microcosm, the law of the telecosm signifies the rise
in the cost-effectiveness of a network in proportion to the resources deployed
on it and the number of potential nodes and routers available to it.<BR>
<BR>
As the network expands, each new computer both uses it as a resource and
contributes resources to it. This is the secret of the stability of the
Internet. The very process of growth that releases avalanches of new traffic
onto the Net precipitates a cascade of new capacity at Internet service
providers (ISPs). They supply new servers and routers, open new routes and
pathways for data across the Web, and buy new terminals and edge switches
to upgrade their connections to the Network Access Points (NAPs), the Internet
supernodes that in turn exert pressure on the backbone vendors to expand
their own bandwidth.<BR>
<BR>
Because all these routes and resources are interlinked, they are available
to absorb excess traffic caused by outages, crashes or congestion elsewhere
on the Net. Because all these resources are growing in cost-effectiveness
at the exponential pace of the law of the microcosm, and total available
bandwidth on the Net is rising at the still-faster pace of the law of the
telecosm, the Internet has been able to double in size annually since 1970
and increase its traffic two times faster still, without suffering any crippling
crashes beyond the Morris worm of 1988.<BR>
<BR>
Impelling the growth of the largest interconnected network, the law of the
telecosm means that the most open computer networks will prevail. Proprietary
networks lose to a worldwide web.<BR>
<BR>
<B>LOADED FOR BEAR </B><BR>
<BR>
I wanted to answer Metcalfe's challenge. As the apparent winner of a previous
argument over ATM and Ethernet [see Forbes ASAP, &quot;Metcalfe's Law and
Legacy,&quot; Sept. 13, 1993], I thought I might have an edge (after all,
Fast Ethernet outsells ATM at least 20 to 1). But when he met me on a rainy
day late in May at his Boston townhouse on Beacon Street, where he looks
benevolently across the Charles at the mit campus, Metcalfe was loaded for
Internet bear. At the peak of his influence, this smiling cover boy of June's
ieee Spectrum, winner of the 1996 ieee Medal of Honor, was ready to explain.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I am way out on a limb here,&quot; he says over sushi and wasabi at
a restaurant near his house. &quot;I actually told a World Wide Web conference
I would eat my column if the Internet didn't collapse....<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What do I mean by a collapse? Well, the FCC requires telcos to report
all outages that affect more than 50,000 lines for more than an hour. I
mean something much bigger than that.&quot; I suggested that with enough
raw tuna and wasabi, his column would go down well. But Metcalfe was dead
serious.<BR>
<BR>
The Internet will collapse and it will be good for us, and for the Net.
&quot;The collapse has a purpose. The Internet is currently in the clutches
of superstition, promoted by a bio-anarchic intelligentsia, which holds
that the Net is wonderfully chaotic and brilliantly biological, and homeopathically
self-healing by processes of natural selection and osmosis. The purpose
of the collapse will be to discredit this ideology.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What the Internet is--surprise, surprise--is a network of computers.
It needs to be managed, engineered and financed as a network of computers
rather than as an unfathomable biological organism.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Metcalfe's intellectual targets are not hard to find. He dubs them the &quot;Wired
intelligentsia, epitomized by Nicholas Negroponte,&quot; and, one supposes,
author/editor Kevin Kelly and hippie mystic seer John Perry Barlow, celebrating
a &quot;neo-biological civilization out of control.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
For example, at a recent meeting of NANOG (North American Network Operations
Group), whenever Metcalfe brought up the problems of Internet management--the
need for a settlements-and-payments process so that people who invest in
the Net backbone can get their money back--&quot;they kept telling me to
get lost.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;They'd tell me, 'You just don't get it, do you?' This is the worst
possible charge of the politically correct: 'You just don't get it.' The
implication is that I am a clueless newbie.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;But I am not a newbie and I do get it: an accelerating pattern of
wild behavior on the Internet [caused by] a breakdown of any relationship
between supply and demand for Internet services, any way of metering usage,
any method of paying back people who invest in the backbone. One thing is
sure: They will not be paid by biofeedback loops.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The result is bad--the deterioration of the public Internet and the
rise of private Intranets. These are not really part of the Internet at
all. Many of them use 'hot potato routing,' throwing any messages from nonsubscribers
back into the pot. It is a tragedy of the commons, a shrinkage of the public
network on which we all ultimately depend.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Since I had frequently cited Metcalfe's Law as an answer to &quot;The Tragedy
of the Commons&quot; argument, this charge hit home.<BR>
<BR>
Metcalfe warns that &quot;back when Internet backbones carried 15 terabytes
of traffic per month, the world's Ethernet capacity was 15 exabytes per
month, a million times higher.&quot; (Exabytes, if you wonder, add up. While
a terabyte is a 1 with 12 zeros after it, an exabyte commands 18 zeros.)
But those were last year's numbers. Carrier of some 40% of backbone traffic,
MCI now reports 250 terabytes per month. Just a small shift in local traffic
onto the public Net can create catastrophic cascades of congestion.<BR>
<BR>
With private networks increasingly becoming TCP/IP Intranets that can use
the Internet but shield their resources from it by &quot;firewalls,&quot;
the likelihood of a crippling cascade from private to public Nets grows
more acute every day. According to Metcalfe, one way or another, such a
disaster is now at hand.<BR>
<BR>
His primary evidence is data from the Routing Arbiter at Merit (the Michigan
group that commands routing servers at every NAP and collects Internet statistics
by &quot;pinging&quot; routers across the Net every few minutes). Merit's
pings yield an echo of chaos: &quot;a dramatic, accelerating rise of packet
losses, delays and routing instability. This data is available on the Net.
But the Merit people are afraid of making waves, offending the big carriers,
so they don't really tell anyone how bad it is.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I ask my readers [at InfoWorld], and they tell me they think the Net
has already collapsed.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
As the North American guild of network operators, what does NANOG need?
I asked. &quot;One thing NANOG definitely needs,&quot; sums up Metcalfe,
&quot;is more people in suits.&quot; The trouble with NANOG is that it is
full of biomystics with big beards and Birkenstocks who look like Bob Metcalfe
did when he finally got his Ph.D. from Harvard after a dramatic setback
the year before, when his thesis board flunked him at the last minute.<BR>
<BR>
(Perhaps it was because he &quot;hated Harvard&quot; and spent all his time
at mit and Bolt, Beranek &amp; Newman, laying the foundations for the Internet
with Larry Roberts rather than sitting humbly at the feet of Crimson computer
scientists refining their professorial perks and queues. Republished in
June under the title Packet Communication, with a new introduction from
the author, Metcalfe's thesis is now recognized as a classic text on networking
that anticipated most of the evolution from the Arpanet to the Internet.
In the front of the new edition is a picture of Metcalfe as a newbie at
the Harvard commencement, with a big beard and a weird shirt and jacket,
looking kind of like a bio-anarchic, Harvard-hating Hawaiian homeopath himself,
ready to help start the Internet movement back in 1973.)<BR>
<BR>
What does this all mean? The conversion of Bill Gates into an Internet obsessive.
The jeremiads of Metcalfe, one of my favorite people in the industry, both
as a technical seer and conservative economic voice in a webby-minded wilderness.
What do I make of the descent into vapor of several of my favored technologies
and the admitted biodegradation of the Net?<BR>
<BR>
<B>NEW SCARCITY, NEW ABUNDANCE</B><BR>
<BR>
Rather than debating this apparent jumble of conjectures--and for a second
time jousting with the Olympian Metcalfe--I would instead transcend the
details in a larger theme: Marking every industrial and economic transformation
are new forms of scarcity and new forms of abundance.<BR>
<BR>
Economics has been termed the dismal science of scarcity. Indeed, scarcity
is at the heart of most economic models; many of my critics still live in
the grip of the dismal scarcities and zero sums of pre-Netic economics.
But what is the controlling scarcity of an information age? In the Industrial
Age, natural resources and real estate were scarce. But Julian Simon of
the University of Maryland has shown that, as manifested by falling real
prices, all natural resources, such as foodstuffs, minerals, clean air and
available water and energy, have been increasing in abundance over the last
century.<BR>
<BR>
If conventional resources are becoming more abundant, what is the ruling
scarcity of the information era? Is it information? Hardly. The information
glut has become a ruling clich&Egrave;. As all resources--from energy to
information--become more abundant, the pressure of economic scarcity falls
ever more heavily on one key residual, and that single shortage looms ever
more stringent and controlling. The governing scarcity of the information
economy is time: the shards of a second, the hours in a day, the years in
a life, the latency of memory, the delay in aluminum wires, the time to
market, the time to metastasis, the time to retirement.<BR>
<BR>
The ruling scarcities in the economy of time, however, can be distilled
to two commanding limits: the speed of light and the span of life. They
form the boundaries of all enterprise.<BR>
<BR>
The speed of light is the most basic constraint in information technology.
As a key limit, the speed of light shapes the future architectures and topologies
of computers and communications. For example, the light-speed limit dictates
that the fastest computers will tend to be the smallest computers. Electrons
move nine inches a nanosecond (a billionth of a second). As computers move
toward gigahertz clock rates--a billion cycles a second--the longest data
path must be decisively smaller than nine inches. Pulses of electromagnetic
energy--photons--take some 20 milliseconds to cross the country and one-quarter
second to reach a satellite in geostationary orbit (as you notice in a satellite
phone call). At a gigabit per second, this means that as many as 250 megabits
of data--many thousands of IP packets, for example--can be latent (or lost)
in transit at any time, thus playing havoc with most prevalent network protocols,
such as TCP.<BR>
<BR>
Thus light speed is a centrifuge. It abhors concentration in one place,
ordains that these small supercomputers will be distributed across the globe
and will always be near to a network node. Although the networks will be
global in reach, they will depend on the principle of locality: the tendency
of memory or network accesses to focus on clusters of contiguous addresses
at any one time. Light speed imposes limits on the pace of any one processor
or conduit, and pushes both computer and communications technologies into
increasingly parallel and redundant architectures.<BR>
<BR>
As a governing scarcity in the new economy, no less important than the speed
of light is the span of life. Just as light speed represents the essential
limits of information technology, lifespan defines the essential shortage
of human time. Although medical and other health-related advances have increased
the span of life in the United States some 5 years in the last 25--while
the media focused on aids and cancer, and zero-sum pundits declared that
our descendants, the scions of our science, will live less well than we
do--the ultimate lifespan remains limited. Indeed, the modal economic activity
of the information economy is exploitation of the technologies of the speed
of light to increase the effective span of life by increasing efficiency
in the use of time.<BR>
<BR>
GDP and other economic numbers from the National Income and Product Accounts
(NIPA) totally miss the minting of new time through innovation: the opening
of parallel universes of choice in ideas, courses, arts, letters, entertainments,
therapies and communities. Finding stagnation and poverty and agonizing
over new wealth, Morgan Stanley gapologist Stephen Roach plumbs the shallows
of NIPA for all the world like the CIA economists who found the Soviets
exceeding the United States in growth for 17 years. Video teleconferencing,
telecommuting, teleputing, digital wireless telephony, Internet mail, cybercommerce,
telemedicine and teleducation all are in the process of compressing the
span of life toward the increasingly thronged channels of the speed of light.<BR>
<BR>
If time is scarce, what is the growing and defining source of abundance
among all the material abundances in the information economy? Signifying
the definitive abundance in any economic era is the plummeting price of
a key factor of production. In order to grow fast, every new-era company
must exploit the drop in the cost of the newly abundant resource. Companies
that use the resource that is plummeting in cost will gain market share
against all other companies and will come increasingly to dominate the economy.<BR>
<BR>
<B>FROM WATTS TO MIPS AND BITS</B><BR>
<BR>
Over the last hundred years, there have been three such economic eras. The
industrial era fed on the plummeting price of physical force or energy,
best measured in watts. Some 30 years ago, with the regulatory sclerosis
of the nuclear and natural gas industries, the price of watts began to plateau,
dropping less than 0.7% per year for the last 35 years. The last 30 years
brought the reign of the microcosm, which fed on the plummeting price of
transistors, manifested in the exponential drop in the cost of computer
MIPS (millions of instructions per second) and memory bits. For the last
30 years, the price of a bit of semiconductor memory has dropped 68% per
year. With this year's decline in DRAM prices, the trend line is being resumed
after a four-year hiatus. The likely result is a sharp upside surprise in
PC sales--and thus in chips--through 1997.<BR>
<BR>
As fast as the price of MIPS and bits continues to drop, however, this Moore's
Law trend line will no longer dominate the economy. Like a great river headed
for a falls, a new factor of production is racing toward a historic cliff
of costs. Over the next 30 years, the spearhead of wealth creation will
be the telecosm, marked by the plummeting cost of bandwidth--communications
power--measured in gigabits per second.<BR>
<BR>
This result means that the growth of bandwidth will outpace the growth of
processor power. After an entire career keyed on Moore's Law, Bill Gates
remains skeptical, foreseeing an era of middleband nets, with shared cables
bogging down in gigabytes from tomcruise. com/vrml and fiber gushing into
twisted copper cul-de-sacs. The usually savvy Network Computing columnist
Bill Frezza believes that bandwidth is inherently a slower-moving technology
than processing, because bandwidth has to be delivered at once to an entire
area while processors can be sold one at a time. Robert Lucky, Bell system
laureate, and Paul Green of IBM debated these points two decades ago. Stressing
the dependence of bandwidth on the labor-intensive digging of trenches and
stretching of wires across continents and under seabeds, Lucky doubted that
communications could ever be truly cheap. Paul Green, a computer network
man, thought that digital computer communications could join the Moore's
Law learning curve.<BR>
<BR>
The evidence mounts that Green was more than right. Impressed by Green's
own achievements in fiber optics, Lucky now acknowledges that communications
power will grow at least tenfold more than computing power over the next
decade. Using the rough metric of Moore's Law, computer power doubles every
18 months. Bandwidth is now doubling at least every year. Over a 10-year
period, this means a hundredfold rise in computer power and at least a thousandfold
rise in bandwidth, measured at any point in the network from the home to
the backbone.<BR>
<BR>
The reason communications power has lagged behind computer power is not
the difference in technology but in regulation. Moore's Law in bandwidth
has given way to what venture capitalist Roger McNamee calls Moron's Law,
the labyrinthine tangle of tariffs and rulings and FCC dockets that frustrate
the implementation of communications advances. With an acceleration of technology
and a tsunami of new Internet demand for bandwidth, this bottleneck is breaking
at last.<BR>
<BR>
Backbone capacity is leaping upward today. As TCP/IP coinventor Vinton Cerf
of MCI told Forbes ASAP in December, his company correctly predicted its
backbone bandwidth would increase from 45 megabits per second to 155 megabits
per second this year, or by a factor of nearly four. But on March 11, MCI
Vice-President of Enterprise Marketing Stephen VonRump told Gordon Cook
of the Cook Report on the Internet that MCI will jack up the speeds to 622
megabits per second before the end of the year, or nearly fifteenfold in
one year. Meanwhile, cable modems, telco Digital Subscriber Line technologies
(from HDSL to ADSL and SDSL) and digital wireless advances promise even
larger factors of expansion in the bandwidth to homes, though unlike the
backbone expansion, the impact will be incremental.<BR>
<BR>
Shaping the future, however, will be breakthroughs in laboratories. As &quot;Into
the Fibersphere&quot; maintained, the ultimate source of bandwidth expansion
is the immense capacity of optical fiber. Now comprising a global installed
base of 40 million miles (some 25 million miles in North America), each
optical fiber, as Paul Green of IBM estimated to Forbes ASAP four years
ago, commands an intrinsic available bandwidth of 25,000 gigahertz. At the
time, the world record transmission over a significant distance was still
approximately 20 gigabits per second, and the highest deployed capacity
was just 2.5 gigabits per second. Moreover, the light pulses had to be converted
to electronic pulses every 50 to 70 kilometers to amplify and regenerate
the signal. This electronic bottleneck restricted the speed of long-distance
transmission to the maximum speed of the optoelectronics, or some 10 gigahertz.
So Green's projections provoked incredulity in many quarters.<BR>
<BR>
Early this year, however, Green's visions were becoming more plausible.
On Feb. 26, 1996, at the conference on Optical Fiber Communication (OFC
'96) in San Jose, Calif., papers from Lucent Technologies' Bell Labs, Fujitsu
and NTT Labs all reported successful transmissions at a landmark rate of
a terabit per second, one twenty-fifth of Green's limit. For these terabit
rates, Fujitsu and Bell Labs used between 50 and 55 separate bitstreams
or wavelengths, each some 20 gigabits per second. NTT, which employed 10
separate bitstreams, also reported diffraction grating receivers that could
resolve 64 different wavelengths at once.<BR>
<BR>
At the same time, erbium-doped fiber amplifiers were smashing the electronic
bottleneck. Impelled by a pump laser (light amplification by stimulated
emission of radiation), these all-optical amplifiers are now being deployed
in networks around the world. They open a new era. Simple broadband amplifiers
made of a coiled fiber thread, they replace optoelectronic repeaters comprising
nine custom bipolar microchips that must be duplicated for every frequency
or modulation scheme used in the fiber. Thus the new amplifiers make possible
the creation of vast broadband fiber networks bearing hundreds or even thousands
of separate carriers, and permit the sending of thousands of separate messages
around the globe or under the seas entirely on wings of light. The bandwidth
of these all-optical amplifiers is now up to 4.5 terahertz, or close to
20% of Green's estimated limit.<BR>
<BR>
The ultimate capacity of fiber is not a merely academic issue. At a rate
of 4,000 miles a day, fiber deployment is beginning to make a dent in neighborhoods.
David Charlton of Corning estimates that over the past five years, the top
10% of U.S. households, comprising most of the early technology adopters,
have drastically improved their access to fiber. Five years ago these homes
were, on average, 1,000 households away from a fiber node; this year, they
are just 100 households away. Milo Medin of @Home estimates that 15% of
U.S. cable TV subscribers had systems directly connected to fiber nodes
at the beginning of 1996. By the end of the year, that number will be close
to one-third.<BR>
<BR>
Hostility to cable TV remains high and politically useful; many city governments
subsist on cable TV franchise fees and regulate these companies into a stupor.
Eerily mimicking computer experts of the 1960s who attested that telephone
wires were too beset with noise and interference to carry digital data,
telco experts today pronounce cable plant entirely unsuited for Internet
bits. But the fact remains that cable TV coax is the only truly broadband
link already in most U.S. homes.<BR>
<BR>
Flaws in the transmission of analog video, in which every glitch of interference
is visible on the screen, fall away in digital systems that can deliver
flawless images at a signal-to-noise ratio more than 1,000 times lower.
Directv, for example, does not outperform cable TV because it is harder
to send a signal a few thousand feet down a coaxial cable than to zap it
to a satellite 23,600 miles away, beam it to an 18-inch dish on a roof,
then send it down a coaxial cable to your TV. The superiority of Directv
derives from its digital nature. Essentially, the picture is created in
the set rather than at the station. Using a variety of new cable modems,
possibly including Cisco and Terayon's CDMA for upstream signals (CDMA finesses
interfering frequencies by spreading codes through them all), cable TV plant
will prove to be entirely adequate for digital transmissions, both upstream
and downstream.<BR>
<BR>
But what about switching, ask the critics of cable? Claude Shannon of mit
and Bell Labs, the inventor of information theory, had the answer in 1948:
Bandwidth is a replacement for switching. Rather than performing the processing
at some central point, you use routers in the Net and filters in the terminals.
If you have adequate bandwidth, you can emulate any switching topology you
want. Cable commands a potential of some 8 gigabits per second of two-way
bandwidth. Linked to the potential terabits of fiber bandwidth, cable plant
has as much chance of accommodating the explosive growth of the Internet
as the telcos do. <BR>
<BR>
The two essential models for the distribution of information are select
and switch or broadcast and select. Select and switch is based on intelligence
in central servers that search databases for desired material, and on intelligence
in switches that channel the material to the desired address. Select and
switch uses computer power at the servers and switches to compensate for
the lack of bandwidth on the network and the lack of storage and processing
power in the terminals. By contrast, broadcast and select is based on bandwidth
in the network and on intelligence and storage in the terminals. <BR>
<BR>
Envisaging video servers, information warehouses and other centralized schemes,
select and switch is the model pursued by much of the industry today. In
some schemes, agents from networked terminals search through large banks
of data looking for specified items, which are switched through the network
to the terminals. Computers reach out and grab data they need from servers
with large storage facilities.<BR>
<BR>
Epitomized by the World Wide Web today, the marvels of this select-and-switch
model are evident to us all. It is far superior for personal two-way communications
and one-to-one file transfers. But it is not superior for everything, as
companies trying to send movies point-to-point over ATM switches discovered
in Orlando and elsewhere. The success of select and switch, using the storage
of servers, has been too total for the health of the Internet.<BR>
<BR>
In its extreme form, select and switch contravenes the laws of the microcosm
and telecosm. These laws will increase storage at the terminals far faster
than at the centralized server and will expand the network's bandwidth faster
than its switching capability. For many uses, the broadcast-and-select method
is appropriate--indeed, inevitable--and its spread will relieve many of
the pressures on Internet capacity.<BR>
<BR>
Broadcast and select is the system used in wavelength division multiplexing
systems in the new multi-bitstream terabit-per-second fiber tests. Broadcast
and select conforms closely with the strengths of the cable system. In late
April, for example, Wave Systems (where I serve as a director) launched
its Cablepc project in the heart of Silicon Valley with the Palo Alto Cable
Co-op. Supporting the test are 26 other companies with equipment and services,
including cable modems from Com21 and En Technology; a merchandising engine
from Zero.one; the Destination PC/TV from Gateway 2000; game machines from
mak Technologies; and content from Simon &amp; Schuster Interactive, Network
News, William Morris Agency, Microsoft's interactive software arm and an
array of CD-ROM publishers. <BR>
<BR>
This system uses cable bandwidth to broadcast huge amounts of digital information
and entertainment. Originating anywhere from the World Wide Web and Directv
satellites to CD-ROMs on a PC, the rush of bits will be filtered and downloaded
by the PC at the programmable specifications of the viewer. Customers pay
for material by the piece and only when they choose to decrypt it through
an onboard &quot;credit chip&quot; or WaveMeter that may be periodically
tapped over telephone lines from a transaction center. Rather than millions
of people downloading new versions of Netscape one at a time over 28.8 modems,
for example, you can program your machine to download all new Netscape browser
releases to your hard drive when they are broadcast, probably late at night.
The next day you can decide whether to buy, save or delete the program.
Explains new Wave Systems president Steven Sprague, &quot;This system creates
a new channel where the customer pays only for what is used, when it is
used, and the owner of intellectual property benefits from each use.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Together with systems of mirroring, replicating and local buffering being
pioneered by @Home, the Cablepc project is one of many ways to use cable
bandwidth to relieve pressure on the Net and to exploit the ever-rising
intelligence and storage in the terminals. Other broadcast-and-select systems
include PointCast for the PC, which uses the screensaver as a way to display
programmably filtered news and other information. Another large contribution
of broadcast-and-select bandwidth for the WWW will come from digital satellite
systems, such as Directv, that devote channels to Internet services.<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, coming to the rescue of the Net backbone are an array of technologies
incorporating asynchronous transfer mode (ATM), an elaborate set of standards
for broadband switching. Supported by some 800 companies in the ATM Forum,
ATM resembles RISC (reduced instruction set computer), which accelerates
speeds by making all instructions the same length and processing them in
silicon. Similarly, ATM breaks all data into 53 byte cells, small enough
to be processed in a semiconductor chip at speeds fast enough to accept
voice, video or data at once. Conceived as an end-to-end system from your
phone or PC through the &quot;cloud&quot; to your Internet service provider
and beyond, ATM seems a panacea for the protocol zoo emerging in data communications.<BR>
<BR>
ATM to the desktop faces dire challenges, however. Paul Green noticed that
the most popular booth at the early May ATM Year '96 conference in San Jose
was by a company called Ipsilon. Now partnering with Hitachi, Ipsilon makes
an IP switch that dispenses with all ATM software and uses ATM cells only
for fast hardware switching. Similarly, NetStar [see Forbes ASAP, &quot;Angst
and Awe on the Internet,&quot; Dec. 4, 1995], now being purchased by Ascend
Communications for $300 million in stock, offers an IP crossbar switch in
gallium arsenide with a backplane throughput of 16 gigabits per second.
Meanwhile, vendors of Fast Ethernet and Gigabit Ethernet attracted increasing
attention. Why transform your network when you can get most of the advantages
of ATM through new forms of Ethernet and TCP/IP? But in one form or another,
ATM switches are still the fastest switches and use their advantage in silicon
integration to dominate the top-of-the-line slots in the backbone of the
Internet.<BR>
<BR>
<B>REVENGE OF BEARDS AND BIRKENSTOCKS</B><BR>
<BR>
The readers of Forbes ASAP will recall Gordon Jacobson and Avi Freedman,
East Coast ISPs who have graced these pages contemplating a national network.
Tonight, in New York, they are debating the future of the Net with each
other and with two executives from a San Diego company called AtmNet who
have similar ambitions. I am there to get a view from the pits of the Internet
on Metcalfe's lament. Jacobson has a problem, though. He wants to take us
to Le Colonial on East 57th Street, which he describes as the hottest bar
and best French-Vietnamese restaurant in the city. But the bearded Avi Freedman
has shown up in a green T-shirt and Birkenstock sandals, which won't cut
it at Le Colonial.<BR>
<BR>
A second-floor hideaway, Le Colonial looks like Rick's place in Casablanca,
so they say, and it sounds like a bar on the Champs-Elysees. More important
to guru Gordon, it allows him to flaunt a tycoon's cigar, unlike P.J. Clarke's,
his other favored haunt, which has succumbed to nicotine correctness since
Dan Jenkins's novel on the Giants, Semi-Tough, celebrated its smoke and
grit. Unlike P.J. Clarke's with its elderly Irish trolls, Gordon tells us,
Le Colonial offers &quot;the most beautiful bartender in all New York. You
got to see her.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Avi, though, has more important things on his mind. Polynomials.<BR>
<BR>
They're a dilemma, those polynomials. But Gordon decides to act anyway.
We will start out with dinner at Clarke's and then move on to Le Colonial
for after-dinner drinks. At the bar, Le Colonial will tolerate the T-shirt,
and perhaps, with adequate lubrication, we will be able to relieve the pressure
of the polynomials.<BR>
<BR>
The Internet is in the process of a horizontal explosion, with new network
exchange points popping up everywhere--two in L.A., one each in Tucson,
Phoenix, Atlanta, Cincinnati--you name it, a hundred or more network exchange
facilities coming online. AtmNet is beginning one in San Diego and has plans
to participate in those in L.A.<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, the P.J. Clarke's waiter, delivering salad with home fries well
done and a Diet Pepsi, is struggling with the demands of serving different
meals to five customers (that's 25 different possibilities). With mental
buffers overflowing and packet losses mounting, he resolves on a polling
algorithm, offering the plate to each of us around the table before settling
on Avi. Gordon is looking worried; Avi is questioning his confidence that
ATM switching can resolve most of the complexity problems on the Internet.<BR>
<BR>
<B>SEX AND POLYNOMIALS AT LE COLONIAL</B><BR>
<BR>
I ask whether the problem arises from scanty RAM buffers in the Cisco routers.
Avi says no. An entire global routing table still takes just 14 megabytes
and virtually everyone on the Net can now handle that. Soon they will be
able to handle a gigabyte of routes, no sweat, enough to deal with any foreseeable
growth of the Net. Yes, I observe, it's exponential; I talk about it all
the time. No, Avi corrects me, complexity growth is not exponential. It
is polynomial.<BR>
<BR>
This problem will have to wait, however, says Gordon, hailing the waiter.
It's time to leave for Le Colonial. Gordon wants Jim Browning and John Mevi
of AtmNet to explain how their ATM systems can transcend all these complexities.<BR>
<BR>
AtmNet is visiting New York to consult with Gordon and Avi about AtmNet's
plans to create a new national 155-megabit backbone across the country.
AtmNet already has a 155-megabit-per-second backbone on the West Coast connecting
San Diego, L.A. and San Francisco. But they are dependent on the caprices
of long-distance carriers to cross the country. Gordon pays the waiter and
we're off to Le Colonial.<BR>
<BR>
After dinner, Avi's T-shirt and sandals pass. But upon arrival, Gordon is
crestfallen: The exponential bartender is off for the night. When Gordon
recovers, we all troop to a table in the corner. Thronging the room are
models in miniskirts--tall, lithe and pneumatic. Across the table, in front
of a large framed photograph with a wraithlike image of Ho Chi Minh in a
Huey Newton chair, a sleek young couple in black hungrily writhes through
hot kisses. A sultry Asian waitress in a red kimono blouse emerges from
behind palm leaves to take orders of port, Courvoisier and Diet Pepsi. Avi
is worried that we still don't get his point about the polynomials.<BR>
<BR>
He wants to correct me: Strictly speaking it is not exponential (that's
when the exponent rises), it is polynomial (the variable n rises). In this
case, the complexity of the network rises by n nodes times n-1, which is
not even quite the square of n. I got it. The growth of Internet complexity
is polynomial. But the growth curve still rises toward the sky, okay?<BR>
<BR>
Avi ignores my comment and cruises on. Cisco is selling 60,000 routers a
month. It's the low end of the Net that is exploding. Hierarchical segmentation
through routers is the answer, reducing the n squared factor to the logarithm
of n. &quot;Log n is wonderful,&quot; Avi says. &quot;It shears off complexity.&quot;
The curves are relatively flat. But what about Metcalfe's prediction of
a whopping Internet crash in 1996? Avi will get to that. And what is the
role of AtmNet's ATM switches?<BR>
<BR>
Indeed. Apparently joining Avi in ignoring these tantalizing questions,
the girl across the table raises her legs and hooks them sinuously around
the body of the sleek young man. The waitress leans forward to deliver the
drinks, suffusing the table with exotic perfumes. The two AtmNet promoters
insist that the router problem can be overcome through the interposition
of ATM switches.<BR>
<BR>
Avi dismisses the ATM argument. The complexity curve is still polynomial,
he says. Whether routed or switched, the messages have to follow the same
physical routes. The complexity is the same. Moreover, Avi's cell phone
is on the blink and he has been out of reach for three hours. Gordon offers
a show-off Audiovox the size of a pack of cards, only lighter. Avi manages
to put through a call.<BR>
<BR>
The girl across the table shudders with pleasure as the man reaches out
and cups her breasts in his hands. &quot;The FIX is down,&quot; Avi sighs.
&quot;What does that mean?&quot; I ask. That means, so I learn, a 45-megabit
line is out of service and the Federal Internet Exchange, a Washington NAP,
cannot trade routes or data with MAE East, Metropolitan Fiber Systems's
Fiber Distributed Data Interface exchange point in Vienna, Virginia. This
glitch ramifies, creating certain problems for some of Avi's new customers
in Washington. The young man whispers something in the ear of the girl.
She balks. &quot;No, I'm getting embarrassed,&quot; she says. &quot;Let's
leave.&quot; &quot;I'll call back in 10 minutes,&quot; says Avi. The pair
unwrap their entangled limbs and staggers up from the table. Avi and the
rest of us get up to go.<BR>
<BR>
Thus ends the visit to the palmy domain of Le Colonial. Before I can pry
in a question about Metcalfe, Avi is on the road back home to his wife and
an Internet crisis at 11 p.m., enjoying life as a Diet Pepsi bon vivant
polynomial ISP. Anyway, it was time for fresh air. John Mevi of AtmNet needs
a break. &quot;Avi talks so fast it makes my ears ring,&quot; he explains.
&quot;You've got to understand. I'm from a telco environment.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
So it was that on a steamy evening in New York, on June 17, I returned to
consult Avi again on Metcalfe's predictions of a network crash. We met with
Gordon Jacobson at Martini's, an Italian restaurant near the Sheraton Hotel
on the west side of Manhattan. While Avi and Gordon consume a lox pizza
and several orders of pasta, I question these men who live on the Net from
minute to minute, day to day, who live in a world of routing tables, TCP/IP
address resolutions, and BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) and Gate Daemons,
about what they make of the doom scenario.<BR>
<BR>
Avi believes that Metcalfe has ascended to an elevation in the industry
that takes him out of the loop. He really doesn't get it. The Merit data
is mostly irrelevant. Pings from the Routing Arbiter are weighted as lowest-priority
packets. It is predictable and unimportant that many are dropped and re-sent.
&quot;That's the way the Internet works. Like Ethernet, it is tolerant of
failure. Undelivered packets are re-sent; they show up as a few milliseconds
of delay.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Metcalfe makes much of Merit's index of router instability, measured by
the number of routes announced and withdrawn. In the extreme, instability
brings &quot;route flaps,&quot; in which waves of announcements and withdrawals
spread across the Net in positive feedback loops that congest the system.
Avi dismisses this effect. &quot;There have been no significant route flaps
in the last six months or more.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
A large portion of the instability problems is attributable to a bug in
Cisco router software that is in the process of being fixed. He confirms
the findings of Ken Ehrhart of Gilder Technology Group that shows little
correlation between the router instability number and performance of the
Net measured by throughput at NAP switches. While all this &quot;wild statistical
behavior&quot; went on, the Net continued to perform stably by using other
routes, circumventing the congested paths. &quot;That's how the Internet
works.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Avi sums it up: &quot;Metcalfe has become an elder statesman and now he
is doing more harm than good, spreading fear and doubt while the rest of
us solve the problems.&quot; As Ehrhart puts it, &quot;These Merit numbers
bear bad names like 'instability,' 'packet loss' and 'delay.' Metcalfe says
these bad things are growing wildly. But in back of these numbers what is
really growing wildly is the Internet and that is a good thing.&quot; Richard
Shaffer's ComputerLetter, for example, reports that MCI's backbone traffic
has risen fivefold in the last year. MCI reports that its traffic has grown
a total of 5,000% since it opened the backbone in 1994.<BR>
<BR>
Like Howard Anderson, Bill Gates, Andy Grove and other bandwidth skeptics,
Metcalfe seems to find the explosive growth of his intellectual progeny--Ethernets
and Internets--too good to be true. All the sages and titans seem to seek
obsessively the worms in the Giant Peach as it hurtles through the air.
The message from Avi, Gordon and the AtmNet crew is &quot;Let them eat worms.
We'll feast on the peach.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Metcalfe's economics arguments are largely true. As Michael Rothschild's
Bionomics shows, growth in natural and economic systems depends on running
a surplus in every cell. But the cells of the Internet are thriving today.
From the creators of the backbone who lease their facilities, to the ISPs
who are madly multiplying their points of presence, the leading companies
are attracting so much investment and support that laggard behemoths such
as AT&amp;T, TCI and the RBOCs are rushing in.<BR>
<BR>
The law of the telecosm depends on the principle that new computers and
routers on the Net not only use its resources but also contribute new resources
to it. If the recent upsurge in Intranets is parasitical to some degree
(because these newcomers use the resources of the Net without contributing
resources of their own), the ultimate parasite on the scene may be AT&amp;T,
which commands perhaps the world's largest Intranet.<BR>
<BR>
AT&amp;T has attracted some 6 million orders from newcomers for Net service,
with plans to have 20 million by the end of the year, while lagging far
behind MCI and Sprint in contributing to the Internet system. Until recently,
AT&amp;T's vast fiber backbones carried just 2% of Internet traffic. AT&amp;T
preens as the largest and lowest-cost ISP, but its traffic mostly travels
the backbones of MCI, Sprint and other national Internet carriers. A key
to clearing the current bogs and bit pits of the Internet and preventing
a Metcalfe collapse is the enlisting of the full-fiber and switching resources
of AT&amp;T to relieve the pressure on the existing NAPs and backbones and
to accommodate the Internet's growth. AT&amp;T is currently moving to supply
such support.<BR>
<BR>
The Intranets criticized by Metcalfe are crucial to the Internet's growth.
Like the corporate PCs that spearheaded the advance of PC technology, Intranets
spread Internet technology through business, expand the market for high-powered
gear, lower component prices, enlarge bandwidth, and bring new users and
buyers onto the Net.<BR>
<BR>
As for Metcalfe's prediction of Internet crashes from private network overflows,
the fact is that no computer memory system could work without the principle
of locality--the tendency of memory accesses to focus on a contiguous region
of addresses. The Internet is similar. Internal corporate e-mail, for example,
is about 10 times as voluminous as remote e-mail. Metcalfe's private Net
overflow cascade is mostly a theoretical chimera. Like Ethernets, &quot;the
Internet works in practice but not in theory.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
A second key fact of the Internet is that nothing in modern computer systems
could survive the combinatorial explosions of multimillion-line software
programs and multimillion-node circuitry without the magic of the microcosm.
Semiconductors sink the complexity into silicon, where it gives way to the
exponential boon of the power-delay product. The performance of the circuit--measured
by its speed and low power--improves roughly by the square of the number
of transistors on the chip.<BR>
<BR>
A microprocessor using separate components would be taller than the Empire
State Building and cover most of New York state. Most of the problems of
Internet complexity must be solved the same way that the microprocessor
solves its complexity explosion, sucking the complexity into semiconductors
and taming it on the chip. This means that Internet nodes would ideally
be single-chip systems. Avi is correct; it makes little difference whether
these systems are routers or switches. Today the backbone is being renewed
by ATM switches because these devices integrate more of the process onto
silicon than any other switches. In the future, broadband optics will likely
prevail by integrating entire communications systems onto seamless webs
of glass.<BR>
<BR>
<B>THE INTERNET AS LIFE EXTENDER</B><BR>
<BR>
The internet is a human contrivance requiring finance and physical renewal.
In practice, this means capital from phone companies and other large institutions.
In the real world, self-organizing systems rely on market incentives rather
than bio-analogies. Metcalfe is right that these incentives must be protected
and extended in order for the law of the telecosm to conquer the laws of
entropy.<BR>
<BR>
The key remaining obstacle to the fulfillment of the promise of the Internet
is government regulation. This obstacle is being overcome at last by the
brute force of bandwidth abundance, stemming from breakthroughs in fiber
optics, smart radios, satellites and cable modems.<BR>
<BR>
In every industrial transformation, businesses prosper by using the defining
abundance of their era to alleviate the defining scarcity. Today this challenge
implies a commanding moral imperative: to use Internet bandwidth in order
to stop wasting the customer's time. Stop the callous cost of queues, the
insolence of cold calls, the wanton eyeball pokes and splashes of billboards
and unwanted ads, the constant drag of lowest-common-denominator entertainments,
the lethal tedium of unneeded travel, the plangent buffeting of TV news
and political prattle, the endless temporal dissipation in classrooms, waiting
rooms, anterooms, traffic jams, toll booths and assembly lines, through
the impertinent tyranny of unneeded and afterwards ignored submission of
forms, audits, polls, waivers, warnings, legal pettifoggery.</BLOCKQUOTE>

ALIGN="BOTTOM"><BR>
<BR>
PB: In the recent past, your ideas and writings have enraged feminists and
political liberals. Today, those ideas seem to be among the guiding principles
of a changed political climate in Washington. We're going to ask you to
summarize the major themes of your books. But, for starters, just what is
it you believe in?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: I believe in a free capitalist sys-tem in a larger cosmic order,
founded on absolute truth. I believe there are such things as absolute truths
and that society will necessarily reflect those truths, over time, in its
organization and behavior.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Tell us an absolute truth.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: An absolute truth I pro-pound in Wealth And Poverty is &quot;Give
and you will be given unto.&quot; To the extent people are willing to give
of themselves, to devote themselves to pursuits beyond their own immediate
cal-culations of self-interest, they tend to be more successful, to contribute
more to society and to receive more benefits themselves.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Then you don't see self-interest as the basis of economic progress?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: No. I don't think &quot;rational self-interest&quot; is the foundation
of capitalism or of economic growth under any circumstances. I think economic
growth is the result of human creativ-ity -- and creativity always comes
as a surprise to us. <BR>
<BR>
To the extent you plan for progress or growth, you will tend to exclude
the creative surprises on which growth and achievement depend. Surprises
mainly derive from the willingness of people to devote themselves to causes
beyond themselves -- to give of their work and wealth to create busi-nesses
or art, to project their energies beyond their own personal needs and perceptions.
This is a generous impulse. It leads to ever-widening circles of human sympathy.
<BR>
<BR>
A new project -- any new economic activity -- will succeed only to the extent
that it responds to the needs of others. The effort to fulfill the needs
of others is essential to important achievement.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Your altruistic notion of capi-talism certainly doesn't conform to the
conventional leftist view of the capital-ist as a predatory, money-grubbing,
self-interested individual.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: That is a caricature of capitalism. Of course, in any society, there
are going to be self-interested, predatory, rapacious people -- and such
people have a lot of room to display their wares in a free society. But
this doesn't mean the essence of capitalism -- that part of it that accounts
for its unique success in creat-ing wealth -- is rapacious, predatory, or
self-interested. <BR>
<BR>
One of the themes of my book -- I'm talking about Wealth And Poverty --
is that this image doesn't work very well. When the leftist says that capitalists
are a bunch of creeps and predators, and the defender of capital-ism says,
&quot;Yes, but look what marvelous effects their freedom produces,&quot;
the left-ist has won the argument. The average per-son just won't believe
that, by giving maximum freedom to a bunch of creeps and predators, you
are going to produce a steadily improving human condition.<BR>
<BR>
And, as a result, the argument for moral-ity in human affairs has increasingly
shifted to the left. You find the Pope assuming, as a matter of course,
that socialism is a more generous and com-passionate way of organizing human
affairs.<BR>
<BR>
PB: And you?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: I think that individuals who pur-sue only their narrow self-interest
are led, &quot;as by an invisible hand,&quot; toward an ever greater welfare
state. The truth is that people pursuing rational self-interest demand comfort
and security; they don't take the risks that result in growth and achievement.
And, without the risk-derived surprises of human creativity, the human race
is doomed. <BR>
<BR>
You need a willingness to give of your time and wealth and effort without
a predetermined reward. You hope for a reward in the future but, in capitalism,
that reward is not specified beforehand. You make your investment without
any assurance you will be commensurately repaid, let alone heavily rewarded.
<BR>
<BR>
This willing-ness to take risks is crucial to master the unpredictable and
unknown future.<BR>
<BR>
PB: And you believe that relates to how men perform in society, don't you?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Yes, because in a free society, men will be inclined to take such
risks. This is what men do when they're al-lowed to -- it's part of the
masculine character. Boys grow up and they want to perform. Their performances
are appraised by others. They fight to per-form well. And I think this desire
to perform, which has to some extent a sexual foundation, leads to the creative
activities so dramatically shown in capi-talist societies.<BR>
<BR>
PB: What is that sexual foundation? <BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Men have to perform in order to please women in a way that women
don't have to perform in order to please men. When you ask the average man
why he works, he'll pull out his wallet and show you a picture of his wife
and kids.<BR>
<BR>
PB: But don't men also work to impress other men -- their peers?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Sure, but that makes my point as well. Young men have to undergo
all kinds of initiation rites among their peers, in the outside world, in
order to qualify for manhood. Young girls don't have those rites. The changes
in their bodies qualify them for the crucial role of motherhood and the
survival of the tribe. There is a consistent differ-ence between this male
need for exter-nal performance to qualify for manhood and the degree to
which biological changes qualify women for their roles.<BR>
<BR>
PB: That was the controversial theme of one of your earlier books, wasn't
it?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Partly. The main thesis of Sexual Suicide is that sex roles are
the founda-tion of civilized society and any society that attempts to repress
them will at the same time subvert civilization. <BR>
I maintain that sex roles are founded on evolutionary experience, on the
mil-lions of years humans spent in hunter-gatherer societies; [and] that
they are further reaffirmed by the biological differences between the sexes,
which it takes a Ph.D. in physiology to ignore and which are evident to
all of us when we examine them. Further, I believe those differences are
affirmed by the dra-matically differing sexual experiences in men and women.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Namely?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Male experience revolves around copulation as the one purely sexual
activity. Women experience copulation as only one of a long series of sexual
experiences running from pregnancy to childbirth to breast-feeding and nurtur-ing
small children. Because women have this extended pattern of sexual experi-ences
that affirm them as women, they have great difficulty comprehending the
much more compulsive, aggressive and anxious male attitude toward the sex
act itself and toward sexual identity. Men have to earn their sexual identity
while, for women, it's part of their very being. <BR>
<BR>
As Margaret Mead wrote, ''Motherhood is a biological fact, while fatherhood
is a social invention.&quot; The father doesn't even have to be around when
the baby is born. He will be around, and be acknowledged as the fa-ther,
only to the extent the woman is willing to affirm his paternity -- to the
extent, in fact, that the woman is willing to forgo other sexual liaisons.
<BR>
This may be less true today than it was in the past. But certainly, through
the entire evolutionary experience of the race, fatherhood could be maintained
as a real institution only to the extent the woman was prevented from sleeping
around.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Sometimes called the double standard?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Right. I don't particularly want to defend the double standard as
a far-reaching moral principle, but it certainly does derive from the very
differing consequences of promiscuity for men and for women.<BR>
<BR>
PB: We'll get down to cases on that topic but, for now, what was your purpose
in writing Sexual Suicide?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: I wrote that book because I saw that, until you understood the difference
between the sexes, you couldn't under-stand the effects of government welfare
policy on the poor. It was obvious to me how, to the extent that welfare
programs usurped the male role of provider, it would be impossible to maintain
intact families. And, as long as intact families were not maintained, it
would be impos-sible for the wide range of welfare recipients ever to escape
from the wel-fare society.<BR>
<BR>
PB: What was the theme of your subsequent book?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: The concept for my subsequent book, Naked Nomads, came to me dur-ing
a debate, when my opponent was talking about how women earn less money,
how they have all these signs of oppression and victimization -- where-upon
it occurred to me that single men could be presented in exactly the same
terms. Single men earn about the same amount of money as single women of
the same age and qualifications. They are enormously more prone to every
sort of disease and affliction than any other large group in the society.
And they commit something like 90% of all the violent crimes. It seemed
to me the statistics about single men had real significance for an appraisal
of the dif-ferent roles of the sexes.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Single women didn't manifest those tendencies?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: That's right. Single women are virtually as healthy and as well
paid as married women, by most indices, while married men earn almost twice
as much money as single men of the same age and qualifications. The obvious
question that arose about this data was whether it was merely that single
men were losers, and therefore couldn't get married, or whether failure
to get married led to a pattern of behavior that fostered disease and criminality.
<BR>
<BR>
I pored through lots of evidence on this point and discovered that widowed
men and divorced men showed a pattern of problems almost identical to those
displayed by single men of the same age and qualifications. Widowed men
didn't choose to be wid-owed, and divorced men may or may not have chosen
to be divorced, but my thesis was that single men are less civi-lized, if
you will. They have more short-term perspectives, because they lack the
links to women and children that lend them a sense of the future -- a kind
of physical embodiment of the future in their lives. Single men, lacking
these long-term dimensions, are left in the very short-term compulsive circuits
of male sexuality. They follow the same patterns of tension and release
that are characteristic of the male sexual experi-ence. Man's link to the
future passes through the woman's womb. Men be-come more stable and less
compulsive to the extent that they have links to chil-dren that carry them
into the future. I thought the statistics about single men -- whether bachelors,
widowers or divorced -- confirmed that proposition.<BR>
<BR>
PB: You seem to be saying that the success of the human race depends on
men's becoming what used to be called -- mostly in bars and locker rooms
-- &quot;pussy-whipped.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: This is one of the great ironies of male chauvinism. Men always
use such terms to the extent they are ex-cluded from the long-term patterns
of family life that women tend to foster. Men asserting male superiority
feel compelled to put down women. The sort of male-chauvinist idiom you
find at bars or in all-male groups, particu-larly in the military, really
reflects an inner sense of the profound dependency of men on women for the
most important of human experiences: Procreation and nurture.<BR>
<BR>
PB: What was your book Visible Man about?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Visible Man began with the title Sam Beau. It was based on two years
of interviews with ghetto blacks. My thesis was that the old &quot;Sambo&quot;
image -- the Stepin Fetchit character that was the previous destructive
clich&eacute; about black life -- had been supplanted on the streets by
a new &quot;Sam Beau&quot; image -- of the swashbuckling street stud, who
didn't work and who spent all his time pursuing a succession of welfare
mothers and engaging in criminal activity. <BR>
<BR>
The pimp image was strikingly manifest in ghetto culture, and my observation
was that this image is just as destructive to people who succumb to it as
the previous, self-indulgent Sambo image. This conduct also resembled the
male behavior in various societies I studied in anthropology, in which the
constructive male role of provider is not pursued for one reason or another.
In the ghetto, the chief reason the male-provider role is unavailable is
that it's performed so much better by the gov-ernment through the welfare
state. <BR>
<BR>
Those were the ideas that underlay the narrative of Visible Man -- which
is, in fact, a nonfiction novel, examining the welfare culture and what
it does to men: How it destroys men and drives them into increasingly futile
virility rites -- fighting and crime and drugs.<BR>
<BR>
PB: You're not suggesting that this is exclusively a black problem, are
you?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Not at all. It s not a special black problem. It's only a black
problem because the welfare culture has been propagated most successfully
in the in-ner cities, through the War on Poverty, which focused on blacks
in the ghetto. The same sort of patterns can also be found in hippie culture,
where you have the violent flower-child phenomenon in a social order that
was just as corrupting as the street culture of blacks in the ghetto itself.
<BR>
<BR>
Middle-class black society is very much like middle-class white society.
Black families are no more prone to breakdown than are white families. And
white families break down just as much when subjected to this kind of welfare
state as black families do. <BR>
<BR>
It just happens that, through the Outreach programs of the War on Poverty,
a much higher proportion of the black poor was induced to accept the welfare
culture.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Do you find no redeeming features in the War on Poverty? You seem to
indict the program totally.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Pretty much. It just didn't do any good. The various well-intentioned
programs might have done some good, if they hadn't been accompanied by a
vast increase in welfare benefits that just ravaged the families of the
sup-posed beneficiaries. The crucial thing that happened during that period
-- that overwhelmed every positive initiative of the War on Poverty -- was
the doubling of the number of female-headed families among blacks. This
meant almost a complete breakdown of the black family in the ghetto itself,
to the extent that 95% of black welfare families lack fathers.<BR>
<BR>
PB: What is the theme of your latest book?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Wealth And Poverty brings all these social themes together with
an economic vision. Present in Wealth And Poverty is the idea that the competitive
activity of men, attempting to support their families, is a crucial impulse
of economic growth. <BR>
<BR>
I also stress the criti-cal importance of freedom as a practical necessity
for economic progress in an uncertain and unpredictable world. The creative
breakthroughs I talked about earlier -- the surprises that throughout human
history have been most important in creating wealth and solving the problems
of scarcity -- have never been predicted. They tend to emerge in defiance
of the assumptions of the experts. <BR>
<BR>
Creativity is always unexpected. After all, if you could predict it, you
could prescribe it. If it were predictable, you wouldn't need it. And, because
existing knowledge and ex-isting resources are always inadequate to an extended
future, human success is necessarily dependent on novelty, on surprise,
on creativity. You have to have a huge outpouring of human creativity in
order to launch the few unpredict-able inventions that can transform all
human life. <BR>
<BR>
Consider the vast number of small businesses that are conceived against
the relatively tiny number that are actually launched. When you realize
that two-thirds of these will fail within five years, you understand how
the process is not a matter of very profound rational planning.<BR>
<BR>
PB: What specific message in Wealth And Poverty do you think the Reagan
Administration finds so compelling?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Well, one of them is that the fun-damental problem of American society
today is that more than half the people in the country now face marginal
tax rates above 50% on an additional dollar of earnings.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Explain what you mean by the marginal tax rate.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: The marginal tax rate is the tax you pay on the next dollar you
earn, beyond your current earnings. It's what you don't take home from your
next dol-lar of income. That's the marginal tax rate and, as I say, it has
now reached a level over 50% for most Americans, which includes all the
most productive Americans, who really determine the directions of our economic
activity.<BR>
<BR>
It also includes welfare recipients. They have very high marginal tax rates.
If a welfare mother goes out and earns an additional dollar, she'll have
to forgo a dollar of her current income -- plus some leisure time. In effect,
she faces a margin-al tax rate of more than 100%. The same is true for people
who are much better off, who face preposterous rates on interest earned
from savings -- which the government quaintly calls &quot;unearned income.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The tax rates on such income are ostensibly 70%, but they end up, after
adjusting for inflation, attaining real levels much over 100% -- often 200%
or even 300%.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Would you elaborate on that?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: If you put $100 into a savings account, you'll be lucky to get 10%
interest over a year's time. But, during that year, your principal has been
reduced by 10% inflation; so, at the end of the year, you break even. The
government doesn't see it that way. It says you've made $10 just by leav-ing
your money in the bank -- and it wants seven of them. So you started with
$100 and wind up, in effect, with $93. Here you're being taxed on losses.
<BR>
<BR>
Whether you're a welfare mother or a capitalist, this situation means you
have a greater incentive to hide a dollar of existing income than to earn
an addi-tional dollar. And that is the perfect formula for a tax system
that, on the margin, loses more revenue than it col-lects. It loses partly
by driving people into the underground economy, which consists of cash exchanges
and barter -- you know, where the accountant does the lawyer's taxes and
the lawyer does the accountant's divorce. Barter arrange-ments like that
are emerging increasingly in today's highly taxed economy. <BR>
<BR>
Tax revenue is also lost because people are driven into overseas tax havens,
or out of productive forms of investment and into postage stamps or boxcars
or rare coins or Rembrandts -- [and] all other non--financial assets whose
sole advantage is that they escape taxation most of the time.<BR>
<BR>
PB: But tax cuts at the margin will primarily benefit the rich. That used
to be called the &quot;trickle-down&quot; school of economics: Give money
to the rich and some of it will eventually trickle down to the poor. Is
that what supply-side eco-nomics is all about?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: No. Supply-side economics is the opposite of the trickle-down theory.
We believe that wealth is created by production -- at any level. That's
why you don't find supply-side theorists advocating tax cuts chiefly for
business. We focus on personal income tax cuts, because we be-lieve wealth
begins with individuals, not with institutions. Wealth is the product of
individual creativity.<BR>
<BR>
PB: There are certainly other visions of how economies are structured.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: To be sure. An alternate approach to taxation, which has dominated
in the United States in recent years and which still dominates in Sweden
and England, is the idea that you can have flourishing capitalism by subsidizing
big corporations while bitterly punishing anybody who tries to make money
outside the existing corporate structure. You subsidize institutional savings
that are channeled back into major corporations or into govern-ment bonds,
but you strongly prevent anyone from accumulating savings on his own that
he can dispose of as he wishes.<BR>
 <BR>
The problem with this approach is that, overwhelmingly, it is disposable
personal savings that make the economy go -- by financing the proliferation
of small busi-nesses, which are the source of ferment and growth. Supply-siders
focus on personal activity as the source of wealth. <BR>
<BR>
As an example, we believe immi-grants are one of the most important forces
in economic growth. They come to the country with no wealth, they generate
wealth and stimulate the lower middle class to greater efforts. This causes
wealth not to trickle down but really to surge up through the whole system.
It starts as much at the bottom as at the top. There's no trickle-down notion
at all in our ideal.<BR>
<BR>
PB: You talk about stimulating small businesses, but isn't most of the wealth
in this country in -- and there-fore aren't most jobs dependent on -- large
corporations?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Since the mid-fifties, the num-ber of small-business starts [annually]
has risen from 93,000 to nearly 500,000. There are a total of 15,000,000
small businesses in this country that create about 80% of new jobs. In fact,
during the '70s, companies with fewer than 250 employees created more than
90% of new jobs, while corporations in the Fortune top 1000 created no new
net employment at all.<BR>
 <BR>
There's no evidence that innovations come from big bureaucracies. Perhaps
the most impor-tant innovation of our time -- the micro-processor, the computer
on a chip -- was developed by a firm with 12 employees.<BR>
<BR>
PB: No innovations from bureauc-racies? NASA, so we hear repeatedly, gave
us Teflon. Bell Labs gave us the transistor.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Sure, but when you talk about Bell Labs, you find they're not prepared
to exploit the developments -- William Shockley left Bell Labs alter inventing
the transistor to start his own firm, when it became clear &quot;Ma Bell&quot;
didn't know how to use it. Similarly, Shockley didn't see how the transistor
could be transformed into a microprocessor, so some of his employees split
off from him to form yet another small business. <BR>
<BR>
As to NASA, that was primarily a case of mobilizing existing technology,
and the payoff was hardly worth the huge ex-pense. Statistics show the yield
of innovations from small businesses is about 20 times greater than that
from large corporations or subsidized research and development.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Is the Kemp/Roth tax bill -- which would reduce rates 30% over three
years -- a direct attempt to resolve the problem of excessive taxes at the
margin?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Yes. The Kemp/Roth bill was the original supply-side proposal.<BR>
<BR>
PB: The objection one hears most frequently is that the Kemp/Roth tax cuts
are certain to be inflationary, be-cause they would create a situation in
which too much money is chasing too few goods.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: But we don't focus on money. We focus on the creation of goods.
And we think that the problem of too much money is best addressed by enhancing
incentive to create more goods. There-fore, the way to respond to inflation
is not to diminish the amount of money people have but, rather, to enhance
the number of goods and services they produce. The best way to enhance their
incentives to create more goods and services is to reduce the tax rates
on traditional income. This is an excellent reason for supporting the Kemp/Roth
concept. <BR>
<BR>
PB: Would Kemp/Roth also stim-ulate savings?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: It would greatly stimulate savings, because a high marginal tax
rate deters savings twice: It first deters you from earning those additional
dollars you're most likely to save, and it then deters you from saving them
by taxing the interest return from savings at the highest possible rates.
So, when you cut marginal tax rates, you impart a double stimulus to savings
but only a single stimulus to consumption. <BR>
<BR>
Increased sav-ings don't enhance aggregate demand, even in the Keynesian
scheme. So, to the degree that a cut in marginal tax rates stimulates savings,
it has an anti-inflationary effect. If we expand savings by a greater amount
than we increase the federal deficit, we will actually reduce inflationary
pressures.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Has that been proved?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Absolutely. This is why the Japa-nese and Germans and Swiss have
been able to run deficits two or three times as large as ours -- as a proportion
of gross national product -- without having inflationary results nearly
as serious. <BR>
<BR>
PB: How did the ideas of supply--side economics develop?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: The essential ideas of supply-side economics arose in response to
the tri-umph of Keynesian economics, which is essentially based on the proposition
that purchasing power drives the economy. In the Keynesian view, it's dollars
in people's pockets -- aggregate demand -- that make the economy go. It
doesn't really matter very much how the dollars get into people's pockets.
<BR>
As a matter of fact, over the years, the Keynesian theory has reached the
conclusion that the best way to put dollars into people's pockets is through
government spending. As individuals in the economy, we're pretty good aggregate-demanders,
but sometimes we like to save money rather than spend it. In Keynesian terms,
savings is a &quot;leakage&quot; from the flow of aggregate demand that
makes the economy run.<BR>
<BR>
PB: That's the demand side of the equation.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Yes. The demand-siders are really interested in monetary aggregates
-- that's their central concern. Aggregate demand consists of money in consumers'
pockets, money available for investment in the pockets of businessmen and
money in the government's pocket.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Are there other areas in which you think our national priorities are
wrong?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Yes. We do not adequately re-ward human creativity and initiative,
which is really the most valuable force in the economy. The Democrats increasingly,
by focusing on investment tax credits and benefits for buildings and machines,
have ignored the most valuable capital in the system -- human capital. Even
when they acknowledge the value of human capital, they see it as manufac-tured
in schools, rather than as a product of individual incentives, creativity
and effort.<BR>
<BR>
PB: At what tax rate do you think diminishing returns set in?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: I believe that any tax rate over 35% costs more than it's worth.
In other words, it damages total economic activity by a greater extent than
it in-creases government revenues.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Can that be proved, or is it just your feeling?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: It s a feeling, but it's an observa-tion that I think most people
will affirm. I think your own observations will con-firm that when the government
has taken more than 35% of addition-al revenues, your activity changes.
To an increasing degree, people begin to consider ways of avoiding taxation,
and they place less stress on earning more money. I would be willing to
defend that proposition. Asian countries that have lower marginal rates
of taxation have been growing much more rapidly than any other countries
in the world. Japan, in particular, has rates of margin-al taxation less
than half as high as ours, on comparable incomes.<BR>
<BR>
PB: But aren't Japan's tax rates supposed to be just as high and just as
steep as ours?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: They are, but the top rate, which is about 70%, like ours, applies
only to incomes over $396,000 in Japan. The top German rate of 56% applies
only to incomes over $50,000. In the United States, any ''unearned in-come&quot;
earned by those whose salary is over $50,000 is taxed at the 70% rate. We
have vastly more punishing marginal rates of taxation than any of the Asian
countries that have been grow-ing faster than any other countries in the
world since the Second World War.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Some observers attribute those rates of growth to cultural or societal
differences.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: That's ridiculous. The Chinese in Hong Kong and Singapore and Taiwan
have very low rates of taxation. The highest rate in Hong Kong is 15%. People
there work terribly hard and ter-ribly productively. As I say, they have
the fastest growing economies in the world. Put those same Chinese in a
Communist system and you have an extraordinarily stagnant and ineffective
economic ar-rangement, even though the people prob-ably work just as hard
in mainland China -- maybe harder.<BR>
<BR>
PB: What about the analyses -- done at Harvard and MIT among other places
-- that show that people won't work hard enough to produce the increased
revenues that supply-siders predict?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: They miss the point entirely. Supply-siders don't predict that people
will work 30% harder as a result of a 30% reduction in tax rates. They merely
predict that people will work 30% more efficiently. They'll tend to focus
their efforts more on taxable activity and less on untaxed activity. These
changes are not directly measurable at all by the kinds of analysis that
all those learned economists have been sponsoring.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Do most other Western nations have payroll withholding taxes as we do?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Yes. Most nations deduct social-security taxes at the paycheck level.
We have a greater stress on income taxation. A higher proportion of our
revenue comes from income-taxation than in other countries, except England,
Sweden and Denmark. The other countries large-ly focus on value-added taxes,
which are a kind of national sales taxes. They're collected on the &quot;value
added&quot; at each stage of manufacturing and marketing.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Isn't the VAT widely alleged to be a very regressive tax, meaning that
it falls more heavily on the poor than on the rich?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: It's alleged to be a regressive tax, but it can be adjusted, as
it is in most countries, so that it's greater on luxury goods than it is
on necessities. Most real necessities, such as food, are excluded from value-added
taxation.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Would you support it as an alternative to an income tax?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: I think it's preferable to an in-come tax, but I wouldn't support
it unless it were accompanied by a much more drastic reduction in the income
tax. In other words, I don't support it as a supplement to existing forms
of taxa-tion, and so far this is the only way it has been advocated. <BR>
Recall that the in-come tax was initially enacted as a tem-porary expedient
because it was such an efficient and affirmative way to raise funds. Somebody
suggested a 10% ceiling on the income tax, and the argu-ment was made that
if you impose a 10% ceiling, the tax would tend to rise all the way up to
10%. So it was decided not to have such a high ceiling, lest we achieve
this confiscatory rate of taxation. <BR>
<BR>
I would want to be sure that the value-added tax weren't just piled on top
of all the other kinds of taxation in the United States.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Is there any condition under which people will willingly pay taxes?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Sure. People are willing to pay taxes when they get something in
return. You'll pay taxes to support the police, roads, libraries, hospitals
-- all legitimate services that governments offer in various constituencies.
It's only when people begin believing that the government is taking more
than it provides that tax revolts occur. <BR>
<BR>
Jude Wanniski, one of the founders of the new school of supply-side economics
-- as opposed to the classical school, which was started by Jean Baptiste
Say and Adam Smith -- points out that in Stalingrad, during World War Two,
people were happily taxed at more than 100% in order to hold off the enemy.
They allowed themselves nearly to starve, in order to provide food to continue
the defense effort. If people really believe that government services are
worth what they cost, they'll forgo income to support them. <BR>
<BR>
But, under cur-rent circumstances, most people think the government charges
more than it delivers, so they reasonably reduce their activity and try
to avoid taxation.<BR>
<BR>
PB: If you were President and you had an amenable Congress, what sort of
tax program would you put through?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: I'd like income taxation at a flat rate of 20% or so, depending
on the revenue needs.<BR>
PB: No progressive rates?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Not for me. I don't think pro-gressivity does any good. It hurts
the poor.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Please explain.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Progressive tax rates don't redis-tribute income; they redistribute
tax-payers. They move wealthy people out of the productive economy into
offshore tax havens and unproductive tax shel-ters. Progressive tax rates
have had this effect most dramatically where they are steepest, in Sweden
and England, where anybody who makes any money immedi-ately leaves.<BR>
 <BR>
Bjorn Borg lives in Monte Carlo. The Beatles spread to the four corners
of the earth. All sorts of wealthy British have emigrated to the U. S. to
avoid the preposterous British tax rates. For many years, they had a 98%
rate on unearned income. The cream of the British economy was redistributed
by ill-conceived taxes to Beverly Hills and Bermuda and Malta and Spain
-- any-where but in productive work to contrib-ute to the wealth and welfare
of the poorer British citizen who stayed home.<BR>
<BR>
PB: So you advocate an across-the-board flat tax rate on incomes.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: That is the ideal system. To get there, my general focus is on cutting
personal-income-tax rates, abolishing the distinction between earned and
un-earned income, and then cutting the remaining tax rates regularly.<BR>
<BR>
PB: That is more or less what Ron-ald Reagan has advocated. Do you see Reagan
as an effective President?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Yes. He's just been quite re-markable. Take, for example, his ap-proach
to the Office of Management and Budget. The usual idea is to appoint a banker
friend or somebody who has a lot of experience in accounting. It's always
been regarded as a neutral office, to which are appointed people who are
adept at managing numbers -- as if gov-ernment really consists of the mobiliza-tion
of competing armies of statistics. <BR>
<BR>
And Reagan didn't. In designating Da-vid Stockman, he appointed not only
a brilliant policy analyst but one who had supported John Connally during
the campaign, who was regarded as alto-gether too bumptious and aggressive
by many of his congressional associates and who was opposed by many other
people on Reagan's staff at the time. <BR>
<BR>
Also, Stockman was a leader in a very controversial movement in economics,
and Reagan gave him the central role in his Administration. That's a bold
act by a President.<BR>
<BR>
PB: What is your vision of the future of our economy?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: I am very bullish, very optimistic about the future of the American
econ-omy. I think that the gloom that has beset us in recent years originates
from three chief assumptions: That we are running out of energy, that we
have some basic productivity problems that can't be resolved and that capitalism
was somehow maladjusted to the modern age, so that the various totalitarian
systems would necessarily prevail.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Do you dissent from those assumptions?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Yes. In all three cases, I see major new developments of the highest
prom-ise. I see huge new finds of natural gas, which, even though they haven't
all been proved to date, nonetheless, collec-tively suggest that today we
have a wider variety of energy sources available or in view than ever before
in human history. <BR>
<BR>
I see that the productivity problem is rapidly being resolved by the applica-tion
of new technology in the service industries. All these word-processors,
computer terminals and telecommunica-tions devices are being installed and
adopted by ever more offices, but they have yet to be mastered and fully
integrated into efficient systems. As we move into the '80s, I think the
result will be major and dramatic advances in productivity. <BR>
<BR>
The third point is the astonishing triumph of capitalism in the past decade.
When I went to Harvard, and later worked on the Council on Foreign Re-lations,
the general consensus was that the Maoist experiment in China was exerting
this potent magnetism on the overseas Chinese on the edge of the mainland.
Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong and even Japan would slowly be induced to adopt
Communist approaches and techniques. <BR>
<BR>
Well, today, all the magnetism has flowed in the other direction. Who would
believe that lit-tle outposts like Hong Kong and Singapore and Taiwan would
be shap-ing the future of mainland China? That the leaders on the mainland
are consult-ing the overseas Chinese on how to adopt capitalist techniques
and regen-erate the economy? This is an incredible change, a development
that has the greatest portent for the future.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Given the supply-siders' con-cern for individual freedom, do they take
issue with government regulation?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Most supply-siders emerged from a system in which Government had
a huge role already. Contemporary supply--side economics is a post-welfare-state
phenomenon. We accept the existence of government and the need for regula-tion
in many areas. We don't oppose regulation except where costs are much greater
than benefits.<BR>
 <BR>
I like the example of rules for a basketball game. You need a certain number
of rules in order to have a basketball game at all. Without rules about
dribbling and shooting, without boundaries, you wouldn't have a basketball
game that was fun to play or entertaining to watch. However, if you begin
to prescribe rules about the exact inflection at which players are allowed
to release their shots, or how high they can jump from different loca-tions
on the floor, or just how fast they can run under prescribed circumstances,
at a certain point the rules tend to become counterproductive. <BR>
<BR>
I think our current problem is that we've gone be-yond the point where rules
promote order and productivity to a point where they are a new form of disorder.
We earlier discovered that soap was a form of pollution; now we're finding
that rules are a new form of unruliness.<BR>
<BR>
PB: You're not talking about a re-turn to the 19th century, then?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Not at all. We believe de-regulation is eminently desirable, not
because we oppose a clean environment or a safe workplace or support the
desirability of poisoning people with un-tested new pharmaceuticals, but
because we believe the current laws are far more complex than understood,
and that the bureaucracies they've spawned are too large and too poorly
organized to achieve any beneficial effect.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Would you give us an example?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: An obvious example is the enor-mous effort to eliminate auto-pollutants,
requiring catalytic converters and other expensive devices. No one has yet
shown a relationship between auto-pollutants and any disease. It has yet
to be demon-strated that the catalytic converters eliminate pollutants any
more damaging than the ones they emit. [EPA disputes this, claiming that
a relationship be-tween certain types of respiratory and cardiovascular
diseases and auto-pollut-ants has, in fact, been demonstrated. Sim-ilarly,
the EPA claims that emittants from catalytic converters are not harmful.]
<BR>
<BR>
Enormous new expense was imposed on our auto industry without any evidence
of beneficial results. One of the obvious effects was the willingness of
people to buy vans and pickups and retain old automobiles much longer than
they did in the past. People are using more in-efficient, more pollutant
vehicles to an increasing degree.<BR>
<BR>
PB: So you would not restrict tech-nological progress at the expense of
environmental concerns?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: That's rarely the choice. Throughout history, tech-nological progress
has entailed the replacement of heavy and potentially damaging machinery
with more efficient and less environmentally destructive means of production.
The obvious development is from the steam engine to the silicon chip. Current
microprocessors the size of a fly have more computing power than the early
computers that would fill up a gym-nasium with tubes and wires. <BR>
<BR>
In gen-eral, economic progress has tended to result in smaller, lighter,
more efficient, less pollutant equipment. To hold back economic progress
in the name of re-ducing environmental damage is entire-ly counterproductive.
This does not mean that intelligent regulation should not be promulgated
in order to transmit to businesses knowledge that's not trans-mitted by
the marketplace.<BR>
<BR>
PB: For example, the marketplace wouldn't resolve the problem of Amer-ican
industrial pollution that descends on Canada as acid rain, would it?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: No. The marketplace doesn't ordinarily place a value on air, or
on water, or on land beyond its borders. In cases such as acid rain, there
may be times when simple Government regula-tions are preferable to some
purer form of market action.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Why do so many well-inten-tioned government programs wind up achieving
precisely the opposite of their planned results?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: This is the phenomenon that I call moral hazards of liberalism.
Moral hazards is an insurance term. It refers to the potentially negative
results of an insurance policy. The moral hazard of fire insurance is arson.
When the insur-ance on a building exceeds its value, spontaneous combustion
often results. There's nothing the insurance company can do about it except
to reduce the payoff.<BR>
<BR>
PB: How does that relate to public policy?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: The moral hazard of unemploy-ment insurance is unemployment. When
government-paid unemployment bene-fits -- plus leisure time -- become greater
than the benefits of work, unemploy-ment increases. The moral hazard of
welfare tends to be broken families and increased poverty -- because, when
welfare benefits become greater than the bene-fits of maintaining an intact
family with an employed breadwinner, then more and more families will tend
to break up and the breadwinner will go to the streets -- into crime and
the underground economy. <BR>
<BR>
And, when the man is gone, the chances of that family's escaping poverty
plummet. Even though its income in-creases, the only way to escape poverty
ultimately is to work. If the government provides the income and the father
leaves the family, the family is still im-poverished, even if its income
exceeds the official government poverty level. With no real hope for the
future, with great difficulty disciplining its children, particularly its
boys, the family will live a slovenly and disorganized existence that will
shock any social worker who ex-amines it. <BR>
<BR>
Nevertheless, the welfare benefits this family receives, combined with the
food stamps, the housing sub-sidies and all the other programs that have
been enacted for the poor, are far greater than the total incomes of middle-class
people 20 years ago.<BR>
<BR>
PB: You're saying that the real income of welfare families today is higher
than the middle-class wage was in 1960. Is that accounting for inflation?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: That includes inflation. Welfare benefits today are worth on the
average between $15,000 and $20,000 a year. That would be equivalent to
an income of about $7,000 a year in 1960, which was the median income then.
We mustn't forget that welfare is, in a sense, an insurance scheme. It's
insurance for people who, presumably, through no fault of their own or through
some con-catenation of events, fail to earn enough money to support themselves.
The con-cept is of insurance. <BR>
But when the bene-fits rise beyond the insurance level, they foster the
very disasters that are being insured against. In other words, they create
incentives for unemployment and family breakdown. And that's wily the Reagan
concept of welfare reform, at least as it applied in California, is misconceived.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Why?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: In California, they seem to think you can raise the benefits to
any level. Reagan raised them by 43% for the alleged &quot;truly needy,&quot;
while, at the same time, he increased the welfare po-lice to investigate
fraud and abuse. Once again, this is a case of ignoring the supply-side
rule, which is that people change their behavior to re-spond to incentives.
<BR>
<BR>
You can't increase welfare benefits 43% without rad-ically changing the
pattern of incentives confronting poor people. You can kick a lot of people
off the rolls for a few years, as Reagan did in California, but soon enough
they readjust their lives to do what the government prescribes. If government
projects a concept of true neediness, the poor will quickly convert themselves
to the &quot;truly needy.&quot; You want disability? All right, I'll give
you disability. You want a mother with three kids who doesn't know who the
father is? Fine, I forget Daddy's name. Right now it just totally escaped
my mind. I don't know who the hell he is.<BR>
<BR>
The point is, welfare applicants don't even have to adjust their lives,
they just have to adjust their behavior in the welfare office. My book Visible
Man documents that proposition fully. I went to the welfare office many
times with various of the characters in the book. They would all ask the
clerks, &quot;How do you want these forms filled out?&quot; The forms are
something totally alien to them. They can't find any correspond-ence between
their lives and those forms, so they simply find out what they're supposed
to say. &quot;What do you want me to say? What am I supposed to say?&quot;
And then they say it.<BR>
<BR>
PB: It seems reasonably certain that Reagan as President has no intention
of increasing welfare benefits nationally. Do you think it's a reasonable
prospect to consider reducing them?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Not really. The Reagan program is not significantly reducing welfare
benefits. There are some changes in eligibility, but in essence they are
leav-ing these programs intact. I think the Reagan Administration will be
resistant to further expansion in these programs, while at the same time
heavily devoted to expanding opportunities in the real economy. The result
will be that as time passes, the attractions of work in the productive economy
will rise, while the attractions of the welfare culture will decline. Welfare
benefits will di-minish, not in absolute terms or in real purchasing power
but in relation to the steadily increasing wages in a growing economy.<BR>
<BR>
PLAYBOY: On what basis do you make that projection?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: In California, after Proposition 13, which essentially reduced marginal
taxation at the state level, everybody predicted unemployment and stagna-tion.
Of all the leading economists, only Arthur Laffer accurately predicted the
outcome. He predicted that the California economy would greatly expand and
that people would voluntarily leave government service to take advantage
of improving opportunities in the private sector. And that's just what happened.
There was no great need to fire govern-ment workers, because they left voluntarily.
<BR>
<BR>
Just about every prediction made by aggregate analysis on the basis of the
California tax cut was wrong. Invari-ably, the supply-side analysis was
vindi-cated. On balance, the impact on the incentives of individuals easily
overrode the impact on the aggregate movements of funds.<BR>
<BR>
PB: But California is a special case.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Yes. It's a special case. It s just one example. Another example
is Puerto Rico, where Governor Carlos Romero Barcelo finally decided to
dismantle an egregiously ineffective tax system that a deputation of eminent
economists from Yale had recommended as the only way to increase its equality
of income dis-tribution. As a result, Puerto Rico had preposterously high
income-tax rates, about 20% higher than our rates in the United States.
Barcelo, after con-sulting with Laffer and Wanniski, started cutting these
taxes and removing the surcharges. Every year, after each tax cut, income
expanded across the whole island by a far greater margin than the tax cut,
and revenues to the government increased. <BR>
<BR>
It's the same story: Increase individual incentive, and you promote economic
growth.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Let's talk about economic in-centives for young people. Would you advocate
loosening minimum-wage re-strictions to promote teenage employment?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: The minimum-wage law is one of thousands of laws that don't do any
good. But it's so frequently ignored that it's not as significant as many
people imagine. The problem in the ghetto is not the minimum wage. The problem
is welfare benefits that are collectively worth more than twice the minimum
wage.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Nonetheless, conventional con-servative wisdom holds that teenage unemployment
is largely caused by minimum-wage barriers.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Well, I don't believe that. I think that teenage unemployment is
ex-acerbated by the minimum wage -- and I don't support the minimum wage.
But I do not accept the idea that our current problems of teenage unemploy-ment
in the inner cities are caused by the minimum-wage requirements. They're
caused by the breakdown of the black family and the demoralization of teenage
boys who have never seen what it means to work to earn a living.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Are you saying the minimum wage is ineffective?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: In the ghetto, it certainly is. No-body goes into ghetto communities
to enforce the minimum wage. Nobody pays taxes in those areas. Half the
retail transactions in ghetto establishments are off the books. I dissent
from the whole idea that we have a rigorously enforced small-business economy
in the ghetto in which rules like the minimum wage have any substantial
effect. <BR>
Don't mis-understand me. It's a negative factor -- one more obstacle to
youth employment. <BR>
<BR>
PB: You seem to speak with some authority.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Well, I spent two years researching Visible Man, which concerns
young people in the ghetto.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Did you live in the ghetto?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: On the edge of it, in Albany. Also, I did hundreds of interviews
with black teenagers in New York City through my association on the board
of the Vocational Foundation.<BR>
<BR>
PB: And on the basis of all that, do you feel that you're better able to
make observations about how a ghetto economy works?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Well, honestly, more than the vast majority of sociological experts
on black poverty, I really did spend three years examining very little else.
I inter-viewed literally hundreds of people at great length in all sorts
of contexts in Albany. Then I spent some weeks in Greenville, South Carolina,
interview-ing the same people and their families down there. And I also
did a lot in New York City. So I really did have a good perspective on the
whole problem.<BR>
<BR>
PB: What did you learn?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: I confirmed all my preconcep-tions. I had read all the previous
anthropological literature on the subject, so that my prejudices weren't
entirely groundless. And, on the basis of thisprevious literature, I developed
the themes of Sexual Suicide, which really originated with my ghetto analysis.<BR>
<BR>
PB: You're talking about the work for which the National Organization for
Women awarded you its Pig of the Year award. How did it begin?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Before I answer, I have to tell you that I succeeded Norman Mailer
in receiving that award and, since it hasn't been awarded since, I think
I've retired the trophy.<BR>
<BR>
PB: We're impressed.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: It began with my support of President Nixon's veto of the Javits-/Mondale
child-development bill, which would have created a vast system of federal
day-care centers all across the country. I was editor of The Ripon Forum,
the magazine of the Ripon Soci-ety, a liberal Republican group. I wrote
an editorial opposing these day-care centers, and a bunch of leading Ripon
ladies went on the Today Show to pro-test my vicious polemics and to try
to get me fired. <BR>
<BR>
Then I went on the TV program The Advocates. This particular program was
a debate on day care, and I was brought in to speak for the oppo-sition.
The other people on the show were all Congressmen and professors and experts
on the subject. After I was through, a mass of women in the audi-ence rushed
forward to attack me. Since for decades I'd been seeking a way to arouse
the passionate interests of wom-en, I realized that I'd found my tech-nique,
and it worked for years afterward. And it was then, as I stood there reveling
in my good fortune, that I conceived the idea of writing Sexual Suicide.<BR>
<BR>
PB: We were wondering when you'd explain how you came to write about both
money and sex.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: When I was single, I was pre-occupied with sex. Now that I'm an
elder statesman, I've moved on to a more dignified concern: Preoccupation
with money.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Staying with the former pre-occupation, wasn't it your statement that
you didn't believe in equal pay for equal work that first truly enraged
feminists?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: That's not what I said. I do believe in equal pay for equal work.
But I don't believe any government program is more likely to encourage this
than the workings of the marketplace. I've seen no evidence that quotas
or gov-ernment programs have fostered it in the slightest degree. The usual
victims of quotas or affirmative-action programs are men with few credentials,
little ed-ucation and large families to support. Upper-class feminists all
believe that any man who makes it just by working harder than a college-educated
feminist must be an evil oppressor.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Hold it. In the first place, you're generalizing about feminists by
depicting them as upper-class elitists. <BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Most feminists are upper-class women. They may call themselves mid-dle
class, but, in fact, a great many of them are in the top 10% of earners.
or they're graduate students or other exalted figures in our system. And
a woman who is a Radcliffe graduate, a relative dilettante in the work force,
often resents the fact that lower-class men can earn more money than she
does by working hard -- often at two jobs -- by putting in overtime and
organizing their lives well.<BR>
<BR>
When you look at the evidence that's available on earnings of the two sexes,
you find that the only group that earns far more than its education and
creden-tials would justify is married men with large families and a high-school
educa-tion or less. My point is that if you know any of these men, you know
they earn every dollar. They deserve more money for the work they do. At
least they deserve it more than some graduate student who wants a &quot;fulfilling&quot;
job in a foundation-sponsored cultural-uplift program. <BR>
<BR>
To the extent the gov-ernment enacts equal pay for equal work, it will mean
more stress on such factors as race and sex, and even more on credentials
and qualifications, while relying less on work effort and ingenuity and
drive and ambition -- those very fac-tors that every close analysis shows
are most important in increasing economic productivity. What many feminists
think will be a fairer system will actually be most unfair: It will favor
the upper classes, who can buy credentials, over the lower classes, who
must compete by working harder and more aggressively.<BR>
<BR>
PB: You re certainly overlooking the Norma Raes of this country, the millions
of working-class women who would agree with some of the aims of the feminist
movement.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Well, the leaders are all upper--class, and I think many of their
argu-ments apply only to that class -- in other words, that women should
be freer to enter the work force to broaden their horizons and do something
more &quot;ful-filling.&quot; For those women who have to work out of economic
necessity, the op-portunities are there.<BR>
<BR>
PB: So, to you, the political aims of the women's movement are merely an
expression of upper-class lobbying.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: That's the real clash -- between lower-class, hard-working men without
a lot of elegant refinements and upper-class women who want their credentials
instantly converted into high salaries. And when I talk about &quot;high
salaries,&quot; I mean the upper 10%. Remem-ber that, in this country, anyone
who earns more than $35,000 is in the top 10%, and when you inquire of these
oppressed feminists, you often find they are earning salaries at that level
-- or believe they should be -- when, in fact, such salaries are the object
of the most intense competition. Very few men -- only the most aggressive,
excep-tional and lucky men -- can achieve that kind of income.<BR>
<BR>
I just think the whole women's move-ment is economically illiterate. It
wants to increase government power in a most arbitrary, destructive way,
in the most sensitive area of the nation's econ-omy -- personnel policy.
That's the area where the most subjective and human of factors are involved,
hundreds of them, and they cannot possibly be re-duced to the sorts of statistical
findings a federal judge or a panel of equal-rights advocates would deem
relevant. To have these decisions made by judges and panelists is ridiculous.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Still, wouldn't you acknowl-edge the fact that many of the inequities
the feminist movement battled against were real?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Actually, it was the feminist movement that was never real. It was
all based on fantasy. Women will never pursue careers with the same determina-tion
and drive that men do. Some will, and those some will rise to very high
levels, as indeed they do now. <BR>
<BR>
But, as to the notion that the women's movement has liberated women from
their &quot;traditional&quot; roles, there's just no evidence that women
are working any harder. Women are 11 times as likely to leave the work force
as men are. [According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. by 1980, women
were only five times as likely to leave the work force.] A couple of years
ago, there was great outrage that female doctors were earning less than
male doctors -- until it was determined that female doctors saw 40% few-er
patients than male doctors.<BR>
<BR>
Wherever you look, if you examine the facts, you discover that women do
not engage themselves in the work force with the same ambition and drive
that men exhibit. Until they do, they won't earn equal money. And they never
will, because they have more options than men -- namely, they can withdraw
from the workforce when they wish to, in order to raise children, a fully
respect-able role.<BR>
The idea that large numbers of women are going to make earning money their
top priority misunderstands the difference between the sexes. Men have to
earn money to be sexual beings -- providers, husbands, fathers. Women have
a full range of choices. You can say that, actually, the woman is superior
because her sexuality ranges through pregnancy, the nurture of children
and all sorts of events of vast importance to society. Men have to do only
one thing.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Wasn't the whole idea behind women's liberation a freeing of both sexes
-- for women to be able to compete equally in the marketplace and for men
to share in the nurturing of children?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Obviously, the men can't share fully in the nurturing process, and
if you go back to Margaret Mead's quote about motherhood's being a biological
fact and fatherhood a cultural inven-tion, comparing the two is crazy. It's
just plain quixotic to have a society depend on the cultural invention of
a father's &quot;sharing&quot; in the same way it depends or the biological
fact of bear-ing a child in one's body and nurturing it at one's breast.<BR>
Regardless of how desirable it may be for men to participate deeply in the
experience of child-raising, these are not characteristic male roles. Masculinity
is not defined through relations with chil-dren: By bottle-feeding a baby,
you don't affirm your sense of yourself as a man. That's why it's the men
who are already secure in their masculinity who are best able to adapt to
the feminist program. Men who aren't fulfilling themselves as providers
have to fund their masculinity in some other ways. <BR>
<BR>
Among the most conspicuous ways, in these years of liberation, are violence
and drinking and other vicarious macho experiences. In other words, what
the feminists attack as male callousness is a product of masculine insecurity
rather than confidence. Feminists increase this insecurity, and thus increase
the pro-pensity of men to assert their masculin-ity in violent and destructive
ways -- and to disparage women as well. <BR>
<BR>
I mean, if you're confident of your own masculin-ity, you can acknowledge
that woman in m any ways are superior to men and are indispensable to male
happiness and fulfillment.<BR>
<BR>
PB: But if what you say is true, aren't you having it both ways? You say
that men who aren't successful at being men are the ones who resist the
women's movement, who disparage women and that men who are successful at
be-ing good providers, at being men, are the ones who can best adapt to
it. If the aims of the women's movement were based on &quot;fantasy,&quot;
why would the most successful men support it?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER Not all do. But those who do are doing so out of chivalry. It's fascinating
to me that so many men who come from traditional backgrounds, who went to
all-male prep schools, through an all-male military, who probably never
worked for a women or gave much thought to female liberation, suddenly find
themselves mouthing feminist clich&eacute;s -- mainly because their wives
were captivated by an essay by Gloria Steinhem. It's just chivalry; they
don't take it seriously. <BR>
<BR>
Ronald Reagan opposes the ERA, but he felt he should give equal time to
his daughter Maureen on the issue. So she uses radio time that he, Ronald
Reagan, earned to attack his position. He wouldn't have done this on any
other issue. It shows he isn't serious about it. It's typical male-chauvinist
behavior: In-dulge the little lady and allow her to be a feminist.<BR>
<BR>
PB: That's interesting. You've ef-fectively called your friend Ronald Reagan
a male chauvinist.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Well -- yes. These are the real male chauvinists. The man who is
a suc-cessful lawyer, or the president of a corporation, or the President
of the United States is secure in his manhood, so he allows the little woman
her frivolous ideologies. He may even say he's a feminist himself, because
he doesn't take these concerns very seriously. This shows disdain for women,
not respect. <BR>
Male in-dulgence of feminism is the new male chauvinism. It says, &quot;I
can't be worried by anything these women do; let them do it. I can't be
threatened.&quot; Well, a man who's serious understands he can be threatened
by women. That, in fact, he is more dependent on women than women are on
him. And that a movement like the women's movement can threaten him -- and
society. <BR>
Because what does feminism liberate? It chiefly liber-ates men. It liberates
men from the responsibilities of monogamous marriage, which is the foundation
of civilized life.<BR>
<BR>
PB: How do you square monogamy with your earlier explanation of the double
standard of sexuality?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: I said that male sexuality is com-pulsive and short-lived, in contrast
to the women's sexuality, but I feel it needs to be domesticated, in a sense,
by women. Otherwise, as statistics show, it impels a very difficult life
for the single male. <BR>
<BR>
Marriage leads to the subordina-tion of compulsive -- and promiscuous --
male sexual experience to the long-term maternal horizons of female sexuality.
It links men to the future through chil-dren. So when the feminists insist
that female sexuality is the same as that of men, it's just erroneous, as
any man could testify, and fundamentally hostile to women.<BR>
<BR>
The idea that women have the same kind of compulsive, single-minded sexual
potential that men have simply isn't borne out by any of the evidence. They're
superior sexually, because they<BR>
have more options and a broader range of sexuality, but it's not the same.
They can have as much copulatory sexual ex-perience as men, but they can
also forgo it more easily.<BR>
<BR>
PB: So you wouldn't admit that the pill and other contraception have had
any effect in changing women's sexual behavior? Plenty of studies indicate
they have.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Oh, sure, the pill has had an ef-fect, but the argument that forgoing
motherhood in favor of a promiscuous sex life has enriched women is a very
dubious proposition. <BR>
<BR>
In any case, the pill would have increased only the very narrow activity
of copulation, and the notion that all of sex can be defined as copulation
is a male-chauvinist idea. To the extent that women accommodate themselves
to that idea, they deny them-selves a far greater sexual potential. You
find a lot of women who have accepted this now expressing their unhappiness,
which the feminists then take as further proof of their oppression. Female
sex-uality is much more extensive and ful-filling than the male version,
because it's linked to other things more important -- continuity and nurturing.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Much of your argument is based on women's childbearing role. But what
about women who (A) choose not to have children or (B) want to enter the
work force before or after rais-ing children?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: The vast majority of women still do bear children. Of the women
who enter the work force, some will succeed extraordinarily. But, in general,
women won't enter the work force in the same spirit as men. Motherhood is
still the central role for women in all societies, and it certainly is central
to those young, dynamic years when families are formed and careers are launched.
<BR>
<BR>
Women have a more important role altogether in the human race, but there
is one area where men will tend to excel -- and that's in the workplace.
Men will tend to com-pete harder at earning money, because that's what determines
their relationship to family and their access to children. Because they
always have other options, women won't work as hard as men -- they generally
don't take outdoor work, for example, where the money can be better. And,
far from accepting the fact that there's been this vast change, I think
that women don't work as hard today as they did in the past. I grew up in
a farming community, and when America was dominated by farming, women bore
children and worked long-er hours at their chores and in the fields -- contributing
greatly to the econ-omy -- than many do today at careers.<BR>
<BR>
The reason that women don't general-ly win the &quot;rat race&quot; is that
they have more enriching experiences to choose from centered on the family.
Men have to perform outside the family to re-ceive the benefits from it
-- even to per-form sexually. The sex act itself depends on male confidence,
and that's why all societies ascribe special importance to male achievements,
even if, objectively, they're not as important as women's achievements.<BR>
<BR>
PB: But you still haven't addressed our question. If the pill has liberated
women from the automatic fear of preg-nancy, and if women want to compete
in the work force outside of that relatively short childbearing period,
why shouldn't the opportunities and poten-tial be the same as for men?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Well, first, I think the pill mainly liberated men, allowing them
to find more opportunities for their short-term, compulsive sexuality. I
don't see that it enriched women's lives. <BR>
But, as to the work opportunities, they're there -- for men and women alike.
Women aren't held back. My argument is that to the extent we encourage,
by legislation or otherwise, forced equality in the work-place, we undermine
the strength of so-ciety. <BR>
<BR>
Incidentally, on the question of postponing motherhood, I've been in-volved
with some groups of older Ameri-cans, and overwhelmingly, the response of
those who waited until their 30s to have kids was that they missed having
grandchildren. Those who had children earlier said that one of the single
most enriching experiences of their lives was the enjoyment of their grandchildren.<BR>
<BR>
PB: You surely have more compli-cated thoughts about contraception. Where
do you stand on abortion?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: It's a bad form of birth control. When it's made freely available,
it tends to become the dominant form of birth control, as it has in many
East European countries and in Sweden. Half of all Swedish pregnancies end
in abortion, and one third of all births are illegitimate. [According to
U.N. statistics, fewer than one quarter of Swedish pregnancies end in abortion.]
Abortion also can in-crease problems of sterility. <BR>
<BR>
But I know there are all sorts of tragic problems associated with the issue,
and I frankly have no easy solution or response. I certainly don't oppose
other forms of birth control.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Do you find many intelligent women agreeing with your views?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Antifeminist women tend to be more intelligent and interesting than
feminist women, because they aren't con-formists. Feminists in general succumb
to the fashion that prevails among the American intelligentsia, while it
takes real intellectual courage and conviction to resist this juggernaut,
which most of the media have fueled and supported. <BR>
<BR>
Women like Phyllis Schlafly and her supporters understand the crucial role
of women in society and the impor-tance of maintaining sex roles in order
to have a happy and stable society. They know that it's the differences
between the sexes that lead to love and fulfill-ment and that attempts to
overcome those differences lead to impotence, ste-rility and a tedious kind
of sensuality.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Let's pursue this topic of sex-ual differences a bit more. You've re-peatedly
singled out aggressiveness in males as one of the factors that make them
better competitors in the work force. And in Sexual Suicide, you wrote,
&quot;Boys are more aggressive because of how they are born, not how they
are raised.&quot; Where's your proof of that?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Biology isn't the only factor, but it's certainly true that men
are more aggressive in every society known to anthropology. As a matter
of fact, two leading feminist scholars, Carol Jacklin and Eleanor Maccoby
of Stanford, wrote a voluminous study called Psychology Of Sex Differences.
In it, they concluded<BR>
that the greater aggressiveness of men is biologically determined -- in
all societies and in animal studies. The studies were made in infancy, before
socialization could be a factor. <BR>
I also maintained in Sexual Suicide that, beyond being a biological fact,
it was also a psychological reality, because the sex act itself requires
greater aggres-siveness by the man. Finally, it's an evolutionary experience
-- because if most of our history has been in hunting societies -- males
have depended for their very survival on aggressive kinds of hunting activities,
while women have always been responsible for nurturing small children, which
is a less aggressive responsibility.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Haven't there been societies in which the women have done not only the
raising of children but most of thehunting and food gathering as well?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Sure, there have been societies where men strutted around and pre-tended
that killing a giraffe every six months was the key to the survival of the
tribe, while the women did all the work. But those were irrational soci-eties
that didn't do very well. You can channel natural male aggressiveness into
roles that are unproductive for the community, and even exalt those roles,
but ordinarily the community won't survive.<BR>
<BR>
PB: What about the evidence of matriarchal societies?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: There is no such evidence. Steven Goldberg wrote a book, The Inevitabili-ty
Of Patriarchy, which Margaret Mead described as &quot;flawless in its presentation
of the data&quot; and which refuted every claim ever made that there had
been a matriarchic society. [Margaret Mead actually wrote, &quot;The reporting
of his sources cannot be faulted... It is when he puts his pieces together...to
form his 'theory,' that he ceases to be persua-sive.&quot;] In each case
that a feminist had described a matriarchy, Goldberg would go back to the
original studies cited by the feminist and show that authority in that particular
society was, in fact, vested with the men. <BR>
<BR>
PB: You're saying that there has never been a successful society in which
equality of the sexes has been achieved. What about Israel and China?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Good examples. A lot has been written about both countries and most
of the evidence bears out my position. <BR>
<BR>
In Israel, there was a real attempt at reversing the sexual roles within
the kibbutzim, and it was found that the women themselves took the lead
in re-fusing the powers ascribed to them un-der that system. Over time,
they refused to go out into the fields and cultivate if it meant having
to pack their kids off to the day-care center. Interestingly, never in the
history of the kibbutz experi-ments did men actually take on child-rearing
roles, nor did women ever take positions of authority, as the political
ideology had prescribed. As a result, today the kibbutz has the most strongly
differentiated sex roles in all of Israeli society. [Other studies on the
Israeli kibbutz dispute the fact that no women took positions of authority.]<BR>
<BR>
China was devoted to some kind of anthill egalitarianism, but when a study
was made of 12,000 people listed by the Communist Party as leaders, only
two -- Mrs. Mao and Mrs. Chou -- were women. And both of those, of course,
made it as a result of being married to their husbands. There just isn't
any evidence that the Chinese overcame sexual-role differ-ences except insofar
as they abolished individuality altogether.<BR>
<BR>
PB: You don't think very much of the women's movement, do you?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Well, I don't think it's done us any good, but I wouldn't exaggerate
the impact of it. In general, I am not a sexual liberationist. As I've said,
I think marriage and family are the foundations of civilized life, and anything
that tends to be hostile to the formation of fami-lies -- or receptive to
their breakup -- tends to increase social problems and decrease productivity.<BR>
<BR>
For instance, I think the feminist movement probably hurts young boys. In
the cases I've cited in which the man leaves home, families headed by females
tend to make it more difficult for boys to grow up into responsible and
loving adults. That leads to increasing distress among women about the quality
and attitudes of men they know -- and the circle closes in on itself. Yet
the response of some of these women is to advo-cate yet more women's liberation,
when this process is the cause of the problem rather than the solution to
it.<BR>
<BR>
PB: You'd better explain what you mean when you say that the feminist movement
harms young boys.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: It goes back to what I said first got me involved in my critique
of femi-nism -- my studies of welfare programs that had the effect of usurping
the father's provider role in the ghetto. The response of feminism to this
miscon-ceived government policy was to pro-pose that welfare mothers be
provided with work and that their children be provided with a massive system
of day--care centers. It struck me that having deprived black families of
fathers, the feminists were proceeding to take away the mothers as well.
<BR>
<BR>
Sometimes I would get the impression, after reading about the proposed solutions,
that to a fem-inist, the only truly liberated individual would be an orphan
at a government-funded day-care center. It just seemed crazy to me.<BR>
<BR>
The real problem, obviously, was to get the fathers back into their homes
as providers. The women just couldn't cope alone with their sons. The boys
were out on the street, finding their masculinity in gangs and various macho
displays, while the mothers were struggling to maintain some kind of order
in the home. <BR>
<BR>
Then the feminists came along with their grand solution: Take the kids away
and stash them in day-care centers and dispatch the mothers to jobs of various
kinds, such as sweeping offices or scrubbing toilets or whatever kinds of
work are available to welfare mothers in America's big cities. And this
was liberation! <BR>
<BR>
The feminists could write won-derful poetry about the stimulating environments
ingenious civil servants could create for the children, but the re-ality
of most day-care programs is a lot less attractive, especially when the
child goes home to a parent exhausted after a nine-hour job. There has been
a lot written by feminists about how good a job can be for both child and
mother, how she goes home invigorated and can be a better parent to the
child. This shows a complete incomprehension of how tiring and difficult
most jobs are.<BR>
<BR>
PB: What about the case of women who, very simply, want to work?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Of course, there are many women in the market place doing terribly
valua-ble work who are making major con-tributions to society. That's one
of the options those women have. But many women are working chiefly because
they have to, because the economy isn't offer-ing sufficient opportunities
for their husbands, and they're certainly not ex-periencing any kind of
liberation.<BR>
<BR>
PB: We think we sense a closing of your particular circle here, from wom-en's
liberation to men's predicament to your prescription for economic solutions.
<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Right. Liberation for many wom-en would be the right to return to
the home and devote themselves fully to domestic life. If things go as I
hope, I foresee a booming economy, and one that will be very favorable for
the American family. <BR>
<BR>
In the end, you can't separate economics from sex or faith or love or any
of the other wellsprings of human behavior. The mathematical models of conventional
economic the-ory -- like the unisex models of femi-nism -- leave out everything
that makes life interesting and makes the economy go. Again, you have to
get back to what's in people's heads -- and that's things like love and
ambition, desire and faith, sex and money -- not aggregate demand or undifferentiated
&quot;human beings.&quot; I nev-er met a human being. The people I know
are men and women, and that's the way I like it.<BR>

<BR>
<H3>My friends, it would behoove you to study everything you can get your
hands on by <A HREF="gildrbio.html">George Gilder</A>, a true American genius.
Here is the second interview he was kind enough to grant me for my newsletter.
Learn it, love it, live it. -- Rush Limbaugh<BR>
<BR>
<HR></H3>
	RUSH: You are very gracious, sir, to consent to undergoing another grilling.
What I primarily want to talk to you about is your December 18th op-ed in
The Wall Street Journal. You made the case that American progress and innovation
have depended heavily on genius. But the thing that puts you at odds with
much of populist thought in America today is that you say this genius would
not flourish in this country without immigration. For people who didn't
read the piece, could you basically recap your theory?<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: All of America's great achievements have come from immigration.
We initially were a nation of immigrants, of course. That was the initial
genius of America -- that we received people fleeing persecution and oppression
in Europe and elsewhere, who found a land of opportunities, new frontiers,
in the United States.<BR>
	This has been true throughout our history. New waves of immigrants have
resulted in new upsurges of income, productivity, innovation and achievement.
The spearheads of this achievement have always been this &quot;genius class,&quot;
as I roughly describe it. I do believe that genius is 90% perspiration.
But it does have a genetic content as well. This is a class of people who
are just enormously more productive than others, and they tend to go where
they're welcomed, and stay where they're well-treated.<BR>
	America has been their land of opportunity for most of the past century.
Receiving these immigrants during the Second World War made possible the
Manhattan Project, which produced the atomic bomb, which ended the war successfully
and then allowed us to continue in the lead in the arms race. This was critical,
because it was almost entirely immigrants who created the atomic bomb, the
hydrogen bomb, the intercontinental-missile program, the space program.
All were heavily fueled by immigration and the geniuses who emigrated to
our shores.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: Is it safe to say that the development of all these projects would
not have occurred at all, were it not for immigration?<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Yes. I don't think we could have had the Manhattan Project. The
Manhattan Project was an achievement of European immigrants, a lot of them
Jewish, who brought their genius to the United States and put together the
bomb. There were some Americans, but mostly in relatively lesser roles.
<BR>
	Then, later, all our technologies fed on this input from outsiders -- particularly
the microchip, which is really the heart of the present, American global
leadership. <BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: George, longer than anyone I can recall (aside from those in the
business directly), you have been touting the relevance and importance of
the computer to America's future. In your piece in the Journal you cite
some of the key inventors of the microchip, developers of that technology,
as also being immigrants.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: The company that really founded the microchip industry in the United
States, as the microprocessor industry evolved into the personal-computer
industry, was Fairchild Semiconductor. When the parent company tried to
control it too closely, the key people spun off and became Intel Corporation.
The group at Fairchild and Intel were led by Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce,
both of whom were American geniuses and inventors. But most of the other
people at Intel, or at least half of the other major contributors, were
immigrants. Andrew Grove fled through a field across the Hungarian border
in 1956, barely escaping the Russian tanks. <BR>
	RUSH: Grove runs Intel now.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Yes. Earlier on in his career, he ran a couple of crucial projects
at Intel that made them dominant in MOS technology, Metal Oxide Semiconductor
technology, which is really the foundation of the whole industry. In every
major semiconductor company, and every major semiconductor project, between
a third and two-thirds of key contributors are immigrants. Americans have
just not focused on these hard-core engineering skills.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: But is that a lack of genius indigenous to America?<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: I think it's the result of a variety of things. In software, which
entails similar degrees of genius, the numbers are not so high: Probably
10 to 15% of the major contributors to America's software predominance an
immigrants. But they are critical contributors. It's not this overwhelming
phenomenon that one discovers in microchips. But both of them were absolutely
critical to the personal-computer industry, which, in turn, is the driving
force of American economic growth and the spearhead of world economic growth
today.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: A lot of readers -- many of them who might not even have computers
-- are going to argue: &quot;How can you say that? What about all these
jobs we're losing to Japan, jobs we're losing to Mexico, jobs we're losing
across the seas -- the manufacturing jobs that everybody thinks are the
heart and soul of this country?&quot; Here you've just said it is the microchip
and its derivatives which are leading the world today in growth and expansion.<BR>
<BR>
	 GILDER: Since the ascendancy of the microchip, beginning<BR>
around 1970, the U.S. has outperformed all the other economies in the world,
overwhelmingly, in job-creation. You just can't make the argument that we've
been losing jobs to other countries. We've created some 35 million net new
jobs in the last 30 years -- while the Europeans, for example, have created
almost no net new jobs outside of government consumption. The Japanese have
created new employment, but substantially less than we have. <BR>
	How can we be losing jobs to countries that are creating jobs radically
more slowly than we are?<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: But the manufacturing sector is what many people look to and say,
&quot;Hey! You can't be a unionized worker anymore and afford a house. You
used to be able to in America in the '50s. You can't do it anymore.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Anybody whose livelihood depends on examining union jobs and the
performance of unions, or collecting statistics for unions, or mobilizing
campaigns for unions, has a great incentive to disparage all this new employment
and opportunity in America, because it does largely arise outside the unionized
sectors. That is true. The unions have all flocked to the dinosaurs. They
all attempt to preserve jobs in old industries that are declining. <BR>
	And the new employment has been emerging in semiconductors, software, computer
manufacturing, as well as services in software. Manufacturing has continued
to grow. We're the dominant computer manufacturer in the world. We also
lead telecommunications and networks. And the Internet, which is entirely
an American creation, is now the dominant force in the world economy.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: Yet you still have, in the American political scene, this anti-immigration
sentiment. And many of the people who are showing some moderate signs of
success [by] attacking this loss of manufacturing sector jobs are conservatives.
Perot's slightly conservative on balance, you'd have to say, although he's
made his money in computers. Buchanan is turning into a David Bonior in
this area, when it comes to industrialized job-loss. <BR>
	And people believe it. When they read you saying this, they're going to
scratch their heads, because there are a tremendous number of citizens who
believe we're losing jobs left and right; that the country is going south
fast; and that we've got to build a wall around America. Yet here you are
saying the worst thing we could possibly do is limit immigration.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Illegal aliens who come in and are prohibited from having employment,
but mandated to receive welfare, are a problem -- it's the welfare state
that's the problem [in that case]. We have a welfare state mandated to reach
out to immigrants and induce them to take advantage of all the benefits.
You've been talking about this on your program. The welfare state is now
an enterprise, and it's &quot;reaching out&quot; to immigrants. The result
is that today's illegal aliens and immigrants are being captured by the
welfare state more rapidly than previous immigrant groups. And this is very
destructive, because welfare destroys everybody it touches.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: There's a rising tide of people who believe that the only way to
fix this is to stop all immigration.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Rush, it makes no sense. I don't think it's very valuable to stop
Mexicans from coming to the United States and doing the jobs they do mostly.
National Review magazine, on the basis of alarms about illegal immigration,
advocates a moratorium on all immigration, which would be incredibly destructive.
It would mean that lots of high-technology companies just couldn't operate
in the United States.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: Let's construct a hypothesis here. There's a wall built around America
-- no immigration. We have embarked on a course of acculturating those who
are here, who have not yet learned Americanism. That's the strategy: Until
we can acculturate those who are here, we need to shut down. Are you suggesting
that, if this situation occurred, there is not somehow an ability here toproduce
the genius amongst those who live in the contiguous 48 plus Alaska and Hawaii
to continue this high-tech revolution?<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: For certain key jobs and key inventive roles, there are just a
very few people in the world capable of performing them. The numbers are
small, and that small number tends to be distributed all around the world.
So any company that wants to be absolutely on the leading edge, to get the
best people in every field working together to produce some new product
-- whether it's a new kind of fiber-optic application for a broad-band Internet,
or whether it's a new kind of digital disk, or a new Internet computer,
or whatever it is -- those people have to command the best in all these
fields. If they can't get the best people to come to the United States,
they have to go to the best people. That's just a fact of life.<BR>
	And it's not new. It was true about Henry Ford, when he was starting Ford
Motor Company. Ford was the leading-edge company in the world economy, and
he &quot;imported&quot; a whole bunch of people from Scotland, England and
Germany to help him build his cars. Key advances in Ford Motor Company were
attributable to immigrants. When you are leading-edge, you are effectively
the spearhead for the entire planetary economy -- [so] you've got to get
the best, wherever they are. That's true about a lot of companies in the
United States.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: Isn't it also true that America is one of the few places where genius
can flourish?<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: That is right. So it would be horrendous, not just for the U.S.
but for the world, if you stopped the geniuses from coming. But there's
another point: For the last decade or so American culture -- the public
culture, the TV culture, the mass culture -- has been kind of hostile to
genius.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: They're hostile to all achievement.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Correct. You, of course, have been the leader in making the case
against this hostility in our culture. But the schools are amazingly hostile
to genius. The result has been that American culture does not produce as
many of these people as it did in the past. Asians who come over and can
hardly read the language are thus immune to most of the seductions of the
welfare state and to the seductions of the imperial National Education Association
establishment. These newcomers dominate the schools [and ignore] all these
distractions -- while Americans are so attuned to the anti-achievement culture
that they regard these activities as beneath them.<BR>
	So the immigrants, ultimately, will help. You get these people in high
schools winning the valedictorian awards and going to the best colleges.
It creates a competitive counterforce that I think will regenerate American
culture.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: Back to this resentment of achievement. We have these high-achieving
immigrants now being aced out of entry into various colleges, because we're
trying to not &quot;humiliate&quot; people. We are limiting the number of
high-achievers so as to spread the opportunity around to others. The goal
now is that everybody will pretty much be the same, in terms of equality
of outcome.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: That is, of course, a menace. If you really want to have equality,
you can have everybody equally poor.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: There are those striving for it, even as we speak.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Exactly. And if you have a moratorium on immigrants, you'll be
making a major contribution to it. Because a lot of these immigrants are
very aggressive and creative and innovative and some of them are geniuses
who can revitalize an entire economy. <BR>
	Pat Buchanan -- who is correct about many things -- has, I think, been
somewhat twisted by this aspiration to cut into the unionized lower-middle-class
Democrats Perot is alleged to have attracted. It is chiefly a political
appeal he's making; he's trying to expand the Republican parry. I think
he's very smart. But they've stumbled on a bad one when they seriously talk
about a moratorium on immigration. Not just a slight little error, but a
truly deadly mistake.<BR>
	RUSH: It resonates, though, because there's a new nationalist fervor among
people who believe their jobs and livelihoods are being taken away from
them. I think they are largely union people who've grown up in unionized
homes; that's been the culture that they've been familiar with, and that's
what America always was to them, and now it's vanishing. Union membership
is down below 15%. And those who still survive are having to &quot;give
back&quot; wage gains and benefit gains. <BR>
	They think that anybody who wants to save their livelihood and their tradition
is a great American, because that's what America was. &quot;America was
not the computer. It wasn't the microprocessor, the microchip, or Microsoft.
It wasn't the Internet. America was steel. It was coal. It was the Teamsters
and truck-drivers.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: We had the Korean War. There were bodies coming back in bags, and
three recessions, and people lived eight or nine years less.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: And you had to have a bomb-shelter in the back yard. You had to get
civil-defense instructions, and to see that the drinking water changed every
three weeks in case they nuked us.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: And, in many of these same union families, their parents came here
on a boat and struggled in some appalling jobs, by anybody's standards today.
I mean, to celebrate coal miners' jobs! One of the great triumphs is to
get beyond this kind of work, where people died years younger. It just is
a false nostalgia. Here we had, during this early period toward which people
are nostalgic, two World Wars, the Great Depression, the Korean War.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: It's an economic nostalgia. They remember the days where you, on
a salary of $12,000 a year, could buy a house, and could afford to send
your kid to college, and there were no credit cards, so you didn't go into
debt. And now the average cost for a house is 10 times what anybody makes
a year.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: But the average house is 20% bigger than it was, and 79% of new
houses have air-conditioning.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: So you would agree with the premise that every day in America is
a better day.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Yes, absolutely! And my grandchildren are going to live phenomenally,
incomparably better than we do.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: Despite what happened to Don Shula, let me go to one more thing in
your column, because this really intrigued me. You know, if I didn't have
my mind, I would like to have yours. In fact, I'd probably rather have yours
anyway. But you say the current Republican fervor to balance the budget
is &quot;Hooverian.&quot; And that they've wasted a year on this premise.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: When you [make] a balanced budget your goal, you play into the
hands of the Democrats. You immediately put the focus on cutting government
spending. So your whole campaign is perceived by the people -- who get their
information largely from the media megaphones -- as negative. The Republicans
are somehow going to cut spending drastically, and this terrifies the 33%
of Americans who are dependent one way or another on government jobs and
subsidies.<BR>
	So you end up terrorizing millions of people, but you don't achieve anything
of value. Because Democrats succeed: As a result of this threat, they succeed
in mobilizing sufficient political force to stop major cuts. Meanwhile,
the things worth doing, the things people will really enjoy -- tax-rate
reductions, privatization, deregulation, all these positive programs Republicans
should push and  you've been pushing for years -- get lost. <BR>
	So we end up just talking about balanced budgets seven years from now.
Who the hell cares?<BR>
	The last time we had a balanced budget was 1979. It was an all-governmental
balanced budget, and we [also] had a trade surplus. Yet the whole private
economy was in the red. With the Reagan years, America's assets have risen,
since then, from about $17 trillion to $40 trillion. Yet we're speaking
as if the Reagan Administration was some kind of orgy of debt.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: Bit is it an error of substance they've made? Or an error of strategy?
Because obviously what they're trying to do is nor just balance the budget.
They're trying to end the welfare stare. They're trying to reduce the size
of government so as to make more prosperous the individual. You would agree
with that, wouldn't you?<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: I agree with their visions. I don't agree with their tactics --
and their tactics have now, in my judgment, largely subsumed their vision.
So they end up essentially attempting to achieve something called &quot;balanced
budget&quot; by cutting various government programs. That is a completely
negative formula, and it's political poison. Moreover, it doesn't achieve
any good results<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: But I am in favor of ending a lot of government programs. I'm also
in favor of the American people understanding why. I don't want to have
come up with a strategy to fool the American people -- perhaps, to win,
you must. But I would love to be able to educate the American people, to
say: &quot;This program is worthless. It's wasteful. It doesn't need to
exist. We don't need to be paying you to conduct sleigh-rides around herds
of elk in Jellystone National Park. And I'm not going to sit here and take
your job away from you without telling you why. I'm going to make sure you
understand this is not a function of government.&quot;<BR>
	Is that strategy a guaranteed loser, because so many people have now been
indoctrinated to the degree that they depend on government, and panic if
they think it's not going to be there?<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: I think you have to start by cutting tax rates. Big tax- rate reductions
would be entirely positive. They would pay for themselves. They would enrich
the country. They would make Republicans popular -- despite what the polls
happen to say.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: The Democrats would do the same thing, though. They would call them
tax cuts for the rich, and you'd still have the same arguments that are
taking place now. Because Democrats are not going to lay down and let happen
what the true objective is, which is to reduce government, regardless of
how the Republicans characterize it.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: To the extent the goal is defined as cutting back government programs,
the Democrats win. To the extent the goal is defined as unleashing the American
economy, creating huge numbers of new jobs and opportunities, reducing tax
rates, deregulating bureaucracy, we win. The focus on the balanced budget
is a mistake, and this mistake was imposed on the party by a pollster. Politicians
who follow public-opinion polls earn the contempt of the public. And that
is the big danger today, because Republicans on television most of the time
are saying something about a balanced budget that isn't true.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: Such as?<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Such as, that it will greatly lower interest rates and produce
all these marvelous benefits. This could be achieved by tax cuts, but [not]
by the balanced-budget process -- because you have to begin by saying tax
cuts cost revenue, which is nonsense. Republicans from the beginning agreed
to accept the static budgeting method, that tax cuts don't affect economic
behavior. Tax cuts increase revenue, as you've explained endlessly, but
this still hasn't penetrated beyond your audience.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: Well, they're even afraid to defend the Reagan years on that. But,
if you get rid of the deficit, haven't you freed up a pool of anywhere from
$150 billion to $300 billion that doesn't have to be borrowed by government
and, as such, won't money be in greater supply? Therefore, supply-and-demand
would dictate interest rates would come down?<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: That's an accounting view of the economy. There's another view,
which focuses on asset values. As John Rutledge at the Claremont Institute
in California explains, we have something like $40 trillion of assets in
the American economy. Those numbers  you're using, relating to the flow
of funds into the federal government, are picayune compared to the immense
changes in asset-values that go on in response to different government policies.
If you cut tax rates, asset-values in general increase. And they increase
not by a few hundred billion dollars, but by trillions of dollars. <BR>
	Money is relevant only as a symbol of productive services that somebody
has offered. This idea that somehow you can I unleash new money which will
automatically expand the economy is the fallacy of demand-side economics
-- and I know you oppose that. Bur the balanced-budget illusion is largely
based on demand-side calculations.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: What about the theories, as advanced by Pete Peterson and others,
that if we don't get a handle on it now, the national tax rate is going
to be 84% for a child born in 1990? That Social Security and all of these
things that actually should be calculated as part of the deficit but aren't
[will] bleed the economy dry, with taxation on fewer numbers of productive
people? They say balancing the budget and paying for what you spend is crucial
to keeping solvent all these various contracts we've made with generations.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Several analysts have questioned the basic accounting functions
Peterson and Rudman and that group have been adducing. But, to Peterson,
the whole Reagan Administration was an absolutely catastrophic failure.
He's one of these one-hand economists. On the one hand, he can see liabilities.
But he can't count assets -- the other hand. So he sees the liabilities
of the federal government growing. But he can't see the tens of trillions
of dollars of new assets emerging from these new industries that have been
generated and are now the spearheads of global economic growth.<BR>
	American companies now earn some 47% of all the profits in world economy.
American dominance today, industrially, is probably as great as ever before,
except immediately surrounding a war triumph. This is much more important
than these numbers Peterson talks about.<BR>
	The Gingrich error was to start by cutting -- by threatening -- existing
programs, rather than by starting with the flat tax. That should have been
what they came into office with. Let Clinton make all the arguments about
why we shouldn't have a tax return on a post card. <BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: Can the Republicans win in November?<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Sure, they can. I think Steve Forbes is really defining the issues
on which we can win. To the extent the winning candidate really follows
that theme, he can win. What's your impression of Steve?<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: I love what Steve's doing. I absolutely do.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Do you think he's beginning to show some real political aptitude?<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: I think he's learning. I don't know if it's soon enough to overcome
Dole's insurmountable lead. It's not over till it's over but, boy, it looks
awfully doubtful for anybody buy Dole.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: A lot of people must tell you this, but you essentially did it
in '94. And you really could greatly change things in '96. I think you could
shape the situation and force Dole to respond to your position, because
you really are the foundation of the Republican Party now. It's a hell of
a responsibility, Rush!<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: Well, somebody has to do it.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Why don't you run? <BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: I don't want the pay cut.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: That's right! But you could make these guys face this issue. They
believe that Reagan's tax cuts were a mistake.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: They do, because to them it's a zero-sum game. They have no understanding
of the expansion capabilities of people keeping what they earn. George,
let's talk again.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Obviously, any time.<BR>

From the automobile to the television set, technological breakthroughs often
have demanded legislative breakthroughs. This is an era of profound and
far reaching breakthroughs in wireless communications. I congratulate Senator
Pressler for rising to this technological challenge by providing the necessary
legislative breakthrough: a set of proposals for spectrum reform that will
go far toward opening the way to dramatic advances in spectrum technology.
I fervently support his five major initiatives--spectrum privatization,
spectrum management cooperatives, spectrum bloc grants to states, federal
spectrum convergence under the FCC, and most important of all, flexible
frequency sharing, as opposed to exclusive frequency assignments.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A crucial complement to the Pressler proposals is is the conversion of broadcasters--now
endowed as spectrum hoarders and analog polluters--into more efficient and
profitable users of cable coax and the limitless infrared spectrum of fiber
optics. As Nicholas Negroponte has been pointing out for the last six years
or more, in his famous proposal for a &quot;Negroponte Switch,&quot; broadcasters
should moue onto wires and voice telephony into the air<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As Paul Baran formerly at IBM and now at Sun observed in his keynote speech
to the Marconi Centennial Symposium in Italy, &quot;The major spectrum hog
[and spectrum problems is analog broadcast TV transmission.&quot; Senator
Dole also targeted this problem in a bold speech tow months ago. Congress
could give every existing broadcaster free access to cable at a cost at
least $70 billion lower than the cost of letting broadcast tycoons have
exclusive control of 485 megahertz of prime microwave frequencies.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Furthermore, Congress should bring to a screaming halt the oppressive new
telecom tax of federal spectrum auctions. If you subsidize something, you
get more ot it. If you tax it, you get less. The US government is now punitively
taxing telecom innovation. As Eli Noam of Columbia puts it, &quot;We can
agree that governments should not subsidize telecommunications under an
industrial policy. We also should agree that government should not extract
huge new taxes from innovative telecom companies.' As Noam points out, this
policy will surely backfire when other countries around the world begin
taxing American telecom companies for their use <I>of </I>the so called
&quot;natural resource&quot; <I>of </I>spectrum. Sure enough, the UN is
now contemplating this global &quot;resource&quot; recently discovered and
sanctified by the taxers and spenders of the US government.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Senators, the air is not a &quot;resource.&quot; It is the environment.
The value of electromagnetic frequencies is entirely created out of thin
air by the inventors of new radio and computer technology. Your job is to
prevent it from being polluted by obsolete high powered smokestack emissions
from analog<BR>
transmitters.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
All existing spectrum policies have become obsolete as a result of radical
new technological breakthroughs in wireless telecopy Converging with advances
in cheap and powerful computer technology, radio is now returning to a pivotal
role in technological progress. At the very moment of a fa W ish fixation
with the radio frequency spectrum--aroused by the FCC's auctions of some
200 megahertz worth of licenses for new cellular Personal Communications
Services (PCS) plus an amazing proposed giveaway to the world's leading
analog polluters--new radio technologies are devastating all the most basic
assumptions of spectrum regulation. At a time when the world is about to
take to information superhighways in the sky, plied by pollution free data-planes,
the FCC is in danger of building a legal infrastructure and protectionist
program for information smokestack industries and diesel locomotives.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Even the language used in describing the auction betrays its misconceptions.
Spectrum is described as &quot;beachfront property&quot; and the auction
as a &quot;land rush.&quot; The basic assumption is that spectrum is like
real estate; many people cannot use the same frequencies at once. Radios
are assumed to be infectious, high powered, and blind; each needs to be
quarantined in its own spectrum slot.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
New technologies from companies such as Steinbrecher Inc. in Burlington,
Massachusetts, Airnet in Melbourne, Florida, Motorola in Schaumberg, Ill.,
Arraycomm in San Jose, and Qualcomm Inc. in San Diego overthrow this paradigm.
Not only can multiple radios operate at non-interfering levels below the
threshold of noise but they can also see the signals of other users and
moue to avoid them. If appropriately handled, these technologies can render
spectrum not scarce but abundant. These developments make it retrograde
to assign exclusive spectrum rights to anyone or to foster technologies
that require exclusivity. Except for the nearly infinite expanse of contiguous
waves, spectrum no longer shows any of the features of beachfront property.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Think of it this way. In the field of spectrum technology, we are in the
midst of a transition resembling the moue from railroads to cars early this
century. A railroad is hard wired and circuit switched; only one train can
use a particular stretch of tracks at one time. Railroads have to be run
and governed by a centralized authority, overseeing use of a particular
network of connected tracks.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A highway, by contrast can accommodate thousands of automobiles, trucks,
campers, bikes, motorbikes, and vans at one time, each under its own power
and control. What makes the superhighway function without top down control?
Essentially, it's smart antenna technology: human eyes.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Human eyes are smart antennas with a bandwidth of some 300 trillion hertz
or cycles per second of spectrum. Human eyes scan the road and assure that
cars do not collide with other vehicles, interfere with them, or drive them
off the road. With every car responsible for its own domain, a superhighway
can accommodate scores of thousands of vehicles at once, each going to its
own destination.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A receiving antenna is like a pair of human eyes: it converts photons into
electrons, electromagnetic waves into electrical energy. The difference
until recently is that eyes are smart: they have 10 billion neurons integrating
and interpreting their electromagnetic signals. Until recently , radios
were dumb and blind. Thus you needed a separate radio for every frequency
channel or road, and you needed to keep the way completely clear of other
vehicles. Broadcasters for example, use obsolete analog signals that require
megawatts of power yet cannot endure the slightest interference; they require
a 50 decibel signal to noise ratio, or 100 thousand to one. Thus these blind
analog radios have to control exclusively their spectrum. Similarly cellular
phones today in the US usually need exclusive use of wide spans of spectrum
and can only reuse frequencies in one out of seven cells.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Companies using obsolete blind radio technology--and experts in the old
analog systems--haue persuaded the government to sell them exclusive licenses
to spectrum. Think of them as railroad magnates prohibiting the use of cars.
You can t have cars on the road, they say, cars will crash into each other,
drive each other off the road. They will speed; it will be chaos. Sound
familiar? I have spent hours at the FCC listening to government spectrum
experts make similar arguments about the chaos and collisions that could
result from a new spectrum regime that follows the inspiration of Senator
Pressler's proposals: his flexible frequency, frequency overlay, unlicensed
frequency, and cooperative frequency management plans. All imply the sharing
of spectrum like the sharing of superhighways or even the sharing of the
air.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I'm sure that if the FCC had to assign an exclusive span of air for each
person to breathe, we would all be gagging and wheezing today. We would
be holding urgent Senatorial sessions to contemplate the crisis of scarce
oxygen. People talk about spectrum as beachfront property., If the FCC controlled
beach sand, we would all be running out of silicon for our microchips.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For a different model, contemplate the 40 million cordless phones in the
US, all sharing the same tiny sliver of spectrum with burglar alarms and
other appliances without significant interference. Consider the scores of
thousands of unlicensed user of the ISM bands (Industrial, Scientific, and
Medical), using spread spectrum technology to share frequencies. Then consider
the rapidly advancing technology of smart radios--radios with antennas like
eyes that can scan broad ranges of frequencies and use whatever lanes or
slots are open on the highway.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Digital radios can function with a signal to noise ratio under 10 to one--ten
thousand times lower than analog broadcasts. These smart digital radios
change wireless from a radio business to a computer business, and that makes
all the difference. With smart radios, it makes no more sense to award exclusive
frequencies than to award exclusive rights to the air.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Smart radios--often called software radios or broadband digital radios--are
the hottest single technology in wireless. The leading technical publication
in the field, EEE Communications magazine, recently devoted an entire issue
to them, noting in the editor's introduction that several articles had been
withdrawn at the last minute because they contained crucial business secrets.
Donald Cox of Stanford University--formerly Bellcore's inventor of PCS technology--predicts
that over the next five years these technologies will reduce the average
capital cost of a cellular customer from $5555 to $14. Last month the pioneering
smart radio company--Steinbrecher Corporation of Burlington, Mass.--was
bought for $93 million by the fastest growing major telecommunications equipment
supplier, Tellabs.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Over the next five years, smart radio equipment will completely obsolete
all the assumptions that currently govern spectrum policy. Broadband basestations
that can handle a large variety of frequencies, protocols, and modulation
schemes will proliferate around the world, allowing bandwidth on demand
for internet access anywhere and for cheap new wireless local loops.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Even the technical difference between wires and air will largely disappear
with the emergence of space division multiple access technology which can
isolate a single call in a cell. Both wires and air will be seen as channels
for photons. Some photons will run at infrared frequencies down fibers with
limitless bandwidth over long distances, and some photons will link through
the air to local base stations at microwave frequencies for mobility. Senator
Pressler's visionary proposals are a crucial first step to this new of digital
wireless communications.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
By contrast, the FCC is fostering a real estate paradigm for the spectrum.
You buy or lease spectrum as you lease a spread of land. Once you have your
licence, you can use it anyway you want as long as you don't unduly disturb
the neighbors. You rent a stretch of beach and build a wall.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
With these technologies available, however, the FCC should not be giving
exclusive rights to anyone who makes the highest bid. Instead, it should
be imposing a heavy burden of proof on any service provider with blind or
high powered systems who maintains that he cannot operate without an exclusive
license, who wants to build on the beach and keep everyone else out of the
surf. In coming years, it may even be appropriate for the FCC to make all
the proponents of Time Division Multiple Access, whether in the American
or European GSM systems, explain why the government should wall off spectrum
for them at a time when exclusivity is no longer needed or desirable. The
wireless systems of the future will offer bandwidth on demand and send their
packets wherever there is room.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
At the same time that new technologies make hash of the need to auction
off exclusive licenses, Qualcomm, Arraycomm, Steinbrecher, and other companies
also radically attack the very notion of spectrum scarcity on which the
auction is based. Smart radios make it possible to manufacture new spectrum
nearly at will. By putting a multiprotocol-basestation on every telephone
pole and down every alley and in every elevator shaft, the cellular industry
can exponentially multiply the total number of calls that can be handled.
Dropping in price at the pace of Moore's Law, these minicells can operate
at 900 megahertz or six gigahertz just as well as at the 2 gigahertz range
being auctioned by the government. It is as if Reed Hundt is auctioning
off beachfront property, with a long list of codicils and regulations and
restrictive covenants, while the tide pours in around him and creates new
surf everywhere.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Still more important in view of the coming auction, this capability of smart
radios joins spread spectrum in allowing the use of huge spans of spectrum
that are ostensibly occupied by other users. The smart radio can range through
the gigahertz reserves of the military and intelligence services, UHF television
and microwave, and direct usage to the many fallow regions. Together with
spread spectrum, which allows as many as 32 users in a particular frequency
band and cell at once, and which permits 100 percent frequency reuse (all
frequencies can be used in every cell), the broadband digital radio system
changes the very nature of spectrum &quot;ownership&quot; or renal.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Unrestricted to a single band or range of frequencies, smart radios can
reach from the kilohertz to the high gigahertz and go to any unoccupied
territory. As such radios become the dominant technology, the notion of
spectrum assignments allotted in 4887 specific shards becomes a technological
absurdity.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In his speech at the radio centennial, Paul Baran summed it up: &quot;There
really is no fundamental reason for a shortage of UHF spectrum...the frequency
shortage is caused by thinking solely in terms of dumb transmitters and
dumb receivers. With today's smart electronics, even occupied frequencies
could be used...The present regulatory mentality tends to think in terms
of a centralized control structure, reminiscent of the old Soviet economy,&quot;
where everything was scarce.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
We should instead adopt the Internet model that is currently reshaping the
entire landscape of information technology. The Internet accomodated a 1600
percent rise in traffic in 1995 without breaking down. In the Internet,
there is no central node, no hierarchy of control, only a heterarchical
system with minimal housekeeping functions at the center. A similar system
for spectrum could emerge under Senator Pressler's visionary proposals for
a new world of wireless progress.<BR>

Congress' Two Trillion Dollar Opportunity</CENTER>
</H1>
<IMG SRC="aredblue.gif" WIDTH="800" HEIGHT="12" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG=

<BR>
Mr. Chairman and members of the Senate Commerce Committee, thank you for
inviting me here today during what is a golden, though probably brief, moment
of opportunity for the American economy and civilization. Thanks to the
nature of new technologies and a dawning political awareness that these
technologies have overturned the logic of regulation, Congress has the chance
to free American industry to lead the world into what I have called the
&quot;telecosm.&quot; Ahead is forming an environment of unprecedented hospitality
for individual creativity, family authority and economic growth. What this
telecosm requires from the government now is bold deregulation -- a freedom
model -- of telecommunications.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Should Congress fail to adopt a freedom model and persist in the illusory
hope that government can shape the future through regulation, America will
lose up to two trillion dollars of new economic activity -- stock market
values, incomes and job growth. Specifically, unless telephone and cable
companies are allowed to merge or directly collaborate with one another
to create fiber optic systems and digital services in the phone companies'
existing territories, and unless entitlement subsidies and other artificial
regulatory requirements are ended quickly and decisively, financial obstacles
to investment will delay introduction of the pending communications revolution
by five to seven years. Not only will our languid economy lose the massive
two trillion dollars stimulus I am predicting, but America also will lose
its worldwide leadership in telecommunications.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I arrive at the two trillion dollar estimate by comparing opportunities
for high technology advances in the 1990's with those of the 1980's, as
illuminated by research conducted by Michael Jensen, recent president of
the American Financial Association, and his students at the Harvard Business
School. Jensen's research reveals how a de-regulated environment aided in
the industrial revitalization that produced such new or reorganized companies
as McCaw, TCI, MCI, Time-Warner, Disney, Turner, and Viacom, and gave a
one and a half trillion dollar boost to the US economy. An even stronger
opportunity awaits the field of telecommunications.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In several books and articles I have described the &quot;law of the microcosm&quot;
which ordains that the price-performance of microchips rises by the square
of the increase in the number of transistors on a single chip. Thus, distributed
single-chip systems grow exponentially more efficient than centralized multi-chip
machines, epitomized by the mainframe computer. It is this law of the microcosm
that has revolutionized technological change in the past fifteen years,
and through it, our economy.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Now the law of the microcosm is converging with the &quot;law of the telecosm.&quot;
This law ordains that the value and performance of a network of computers
rises apace with the square of the increase in the number of computers linked
to it. As these forces fuse, the world of computers and communications rides
an exponential rocket.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Among the wonders awaiting us in the telecosm is, for example, a &quot;teleputer&quot;
that combines, in one unit, interactive video and telecommunications. It
will replace today's televisions and telephones and lend the users access
to a vast world-wide network of other teleputers: mass communication when
desired, but, more often, highly personalized entry to libraries of texts,
libraries of films, Internet-style forums, teleconferencing from home to
home or home to office, interactive distance learning, virtual family gatherings,
telemedicine and huge new business markets -- all brought within the reach
of ordinary Americans, not just the rich. By making the choices we want,
moreover, rather than the choices someone in a studio or bureaucracy wish
to impose upon us, the frustrated American citizen will gain new authority
and enthusiasm about his ability to affect his work, entertainment, education
and even his government. For merely one small example: just as C-Span circumvents
broadcast producers and brings certain events in Congress directly to viewers,
in the telecosm the viewer will decide on his own which floor action and
which of many committees to &quot;attend&quot; via his teleputer -- including
hearings like this one.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Participation in the telecosm will be affordable for ordinary citizens.
But the initial structural investments will be large for the system developers.
The most expensive part of the conversion to the telecosm is establishing
broadband connections to millions and millions of homes, where, not coincidentally,
the bulk of the new personal computers are to be found. Fortunately, the
United States, almost alone in the world, already has these connections
in place in the form of cable TV.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But cable TV is not likely to survive long in its present state. New technology
-- DBS (Direct Broadcast Satellite), in this case -- is going to blow away
the existing cable companies unless Congress permits them to operate freely.
Currently, cable is a classic example of outdated government regulation
wrongly premised on the danger of monopoly. Cable's hope is to find a new
use. And that new use, in fact, is available, thanks to the needs of telephone
companies -- whose own monopoly of local service is already disappearing,
also in the face of new technologies. Telephone companies require a way
to enter the home to provide broadband connections to the teleputer and
other services, but duplicating cable's connections is an obvious waste
of years of time and hundreds of billions of dollars. New technology thus
closes off old monopoly advantages and opens opportunities for free market
collaboration.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Bringing broadband digitally switched services over cable wires to the home
will still require investments of $l00-300 billion, but these can be and
should be provided by the private sector, without government subsidies or
guarantees. There is no knowing in advance which companies will succeed
in the telecosm and it is futile and counterproductive for government to
guess. The once-legitimate concern about communications monopolies has been
silenced by the centrifugal force of the computer chip. Bigness no longer
assures success in telecommunications, and trying to protect one industry
or company against another when no one can tell which one will survive,
in any case, will only make the needed investments unpromising financially
and set back the movement into the telecosm by five to seven years, well
into the 21st century. On the other hand, if Congress will stop focusing
on how to fine tune regulations and focus instead on eliminating them more
completely, we can have the teleputer and similar revolutionary devices
within the next three years, which -- I might mention -- is within the terms
of many of you in this room. The secret, as Cal Tech Professor Carver Mead
says, is to &quot;listen to the technology.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The futility of regulation is further underscored by the likely creation
of new companies outside any presently foreseen regulatory framework. Either
these information service newcomers will have a government-sanctioned advantage
over regulated companies or the government will find a way to draw the newcomers
into its regulatory grasp -- and perhaps with them, whole previously unregulated
areas of the economy, such as computers and software.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Government regulation supposedly claims to protect competition, of course,
but it is the kind of competition where nobody wins and nobody loses. Such
guarded competition will prevent the restructuring and profit incentives
that must be available to make large investments possible. Only competition
that permits robust rivalries will bring the teleputer and other inventions
on-line swiftly.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Mr. Chairman, last year I was concerned that the Congress was still trying
to develop a regulatory regime based on an outdated belief in natural monopolies
in telecommunications. But, this year I am more hopeful, particularly after
production of the discussion draft advanced recently by Republicans members
of this Committee. Now, indeed, it seems that almost the whole federal government,
including the Executive Branch, is beginning to hum the music of telecom's
de-regulation. But it is not altogether obvious that all of them have bothered
to learn the words. One test of whether claims of de-regulation are valid
is to see whether a proposed law has been adjusted to acknowledge emerging
technologies or whether it still tries to force new technologies to fit
old government regulations. Even the admirable discussion draft the committee
majority produced, I think, should be examined in this light.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For example, consider the issue of universal service. The basic problem
of universal service is that with current wireline telephony and cable TV,
it costs many times as much to serve rural customers as urban customers.
But, new wireless digital technologies have overthrown this problem. At
a time when all voice telephony is rapidly moving to wireless, new digital
cellular systems will soon lower the price of wireless telephony tenfold
and totally close the cost gap between rural and urban customers. This removes
the need for either cross subsidies or universal service requirements.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, as I mentioned, Direct Broadcast Satellite (DBS) already delivers
service superior to cable TV with supreme universality across the entire
continent and completely discredits the idea that cable TV is a monopoly
or that hundreds of channels of video will be restricted to favorite areas.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
All these examples of technology rendering regulations obsolete should lead
us to the conclusion, then, that the only sound telecommunications policy
is the freedom model. A freedom model would allow all existing companies
-- and new ones yet to be created -- to buy and sell and enter each others'
businesses without undue government interference or delay, granting only
common carrier status in return. It would remove restrictions to cross-ownership
of cable and telephone lines. It would not force companies to separate their
functions unnaturally -- and unprofitably -- into subsidiaries. It would
not impose delayed entry schedules and other invidious tests upon competition.
And, of course, it would not demand universal service or other hidden entitlements.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A freedom model, however, would restrict the powers of state public utility
commissions to regulate investment and depreciation rules, to ensure rate
re-balancing and pricing flexibility. Both cable and telephone companies
should be free of pricing restrictions to encourage investment and to eliminate
the current cross subsidies that discourage competition and the introduction
of new services.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Mr. Chairman, the freedom model of de-regulation is not likely to be any
company's or industry's first choice. Each, of course, would like to preside
over a government-protected monopoly and to enjoy government restrictions
on its competition. That is human nature. But since you cannot possibly
grant special advantages to everybody, it would seem logical that free and
open competition should be accepted as each lobby's second choice. But for
the public interest, I would suggest, the freedom model should be acclaimed
as the logical first choice -- and adopted, accordingly, by this Committee
and the Congress.

<B>George Gilder is a Senior Fellow at Discovery Institute</B> where he
directs Discovery's program on <A HREF="hightech.html">high technology and
public policy</A>. <BR>
<BR>
Born in 1939 in New York City, Mr. Gilder attended Exeter Academy and Harvard
University. At Harvard he studied under Henry Kissinger and helped found
Advance, a journal of political thought, which he edited and helped to re-establish
in Washington, D.C. after his graduation in 1962. During this period he
co-authored (with Bruce Chapman) a political history, <I>The Party That
Lost its Head.</I> He later returned to Harvard as a fellow at the Kennedy
Institute of Politics and editor of the Ripon Forum. In the 1960's Mr. Gilder
also served a speech writer for several prominent officials and candidates,
including Nelson Rockefeller, George Romney and Richard Nixon. <BR>
<BR>
In the 1970's, as an independent researcher and writer, Mr. Gilder began
an excursion into the causes of poverty, which resulted in his books <I>Men
and Marriage</I> (original version, 1972) and <I>Visible Man </I>(1978);
and, hence, of wealth, which led to <B><I>his bestselling Wealth and Poverty
</I></B>(1981). <BR>
<BR>
<B>Mr. Gilder pioneered the formulation of supply-side economics</B> when
he served as Chairman of the Lehrman Institute's Economics Roundtable, as
Program Director for the Manhattan Institute, and as a frequent contributor
to A.B. Laffer's economic reports and the editorial page of the <I>Wall
Street Journal</I>. In the 1980's he also consulted leaders of America's
high technology businesses. <B>According to a recent study of speeches,
Mr. Gilder was President Reagan's most frequently quoted living author.</B>
<BR>
<BR>
The investigation into wealth creation led Mr. Gilder into deeper examination
of the lives of present-day entrepreneurs, culminating in many articles
and a book, <I>The Spirit of Enterprise </I>(1986). The book was recently
revised and expanded for publication in 1992. That many of the most interesting
current entrepreneurs were to be found in high technology fields also led
Mr. Gilder, over several years, to examine these fields in depth. In his
bestselling work, <I>Microcosm</I> (1989), he explored the quantum roots
of the new electronic technologies. A subsequent best selling book, <I>Life
After Television</I>, published first as a Whittle Communications monograph
and then republished by W.W. Norton (1992), is a prophecy of the future
of computers and telecommunications. <B><I>Life After Television</I> was
recently updated and a new forward included when it was republished in 1994</B>.
This book, in turn, is a prelude to his forthcoming book on the future of
telecommunications, <I>Telecosm</I> (expected in early 1996). <BR>
<BR>
<B>In 1986, President Reagan gave George Gilder the White House Award for
Entrepreneurial Excellence</B>. Mr. Gilder participates in national and
international conferences and is<A HREF="ggindex.html"> a contributing editor
of Forbes ASAP, and a writer of articles on high technology for Forbes magazine</A>
and other journals and newspapers. In addition, he is often requested to
testify before the U.S. Senate and U.S. House on various telecommunications
issues. <BR>
<BR>
He operates jointly from the Seattle headquarters of Discovery Institute
and his home at Tyringham, Massachusetts, in the Berkshire Mountains where
he is an active churchman, sometime runner, and, with his wife, Nini, parent
of four children. <BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>New technologies will continue to be powerful agents of growth
and progress in the next century, opening up traditional fields to a surge
of entrepreneurial activity that can help revive our culture and economy.<BR>
<BR>
Led by Senior Fellow <A HREF="gildrbio.html">George Gilder</A>, the program
examines how new technologies are transforming business, education, government,
and society. Among other issues the program explores government telecommunications
policy and the role of technology in reforming institutions such as the
legal profession. Other Discovery Fellows working in the program include
Frank Gregorsky, <A HREF="gidari.html">Albert Gidari</A>, <A HREF="katz.html">Roberta
Katz</A>, <A HREF="brownleebio.html">Lisa Brownlee</A>, and Adjunct Fellow
<A HREF="perelman.html">Lewis Perelman</A>.<BR>
<BR>
Properly enabled, new technology is a still unimagined boon. In books such
as <I><A HREF="books.html">MICROCOSM</A>, <A HREF="schlsout.html">SCHOOL'S
OUT</A>, <A HREF="life-tv.html">LIFE AFTER TELEVISION</A></I>, and, soon,
<I>TELECOSM</I>, Gilder and other Discovery Fellows are defining the issues,
as well as the opportunities, arising in this increasingly influential field.

<B>Rising distrust of government threatens to demoralize our system of representative
democracy. Headeded by Discovery Institute president <A HREF="chapman.html">Bruce

of civics instruction, diminished rewards for virtue in public life, the
unintended consequences of the political reform movement, and the over-reaching
ambition of government itself.<BR>

The program aims to restaste the purposes of robust and effective representative
democracy, advocating a &quot;reform of the reforms,&quot; strengthened
political parties, and revived commitment to public service. Discovery Fellows

<a name="intro"><h4>INTRODUCTION</h4></a>
[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]
<p>
The federal government subsidizes lobbying by tax-exempt and other 
organizations through grants and contracts to advocacy groups.  Each year, the 
American taxpayers provide more than $39 billion in grants to organizations 
which may use the money to advance their political agendas.
<p>
Federal funding of private advocacy is not limited by ideological scope.  
Organizations to the left and right of the political center use taxpayers funds to 
promote their ideas and positions.  Almost every interest in America - from 
agriculture to zoology - has one or more organizations receiving government 
funding.  Recipients range from the American Association of Retired Persons, 
which received over $73 million in a one-year period, to the American Bar 
Association, which received $2.2 million.   Over the past forty years, Congress 
has helped create a vast patronage network of organizations that enjoy tax-
preferred status, receive federal funds, and engage in legislative or political 
advocacy.  The days of big city political machines disbursing patronage may be 
coming to an end, but the disbursement of financial dividends to political friends 
is a prominent feature of the federal budget.  As Heritage Foundation Senior 
Fellow <a href="http://www.townhall.com/heritage/staff/breger.htm">Marshall Breger</a> has written:
<p>
<blockquote><Font Size="-1">Lacking the imprimatur of democratic consent, government subsidy of private advocacy can be seen for what it is - the public patronage of selected political beliefs.  That these advocacy subsidies are rarely made openly but are often disguised through grants and contracts for legitimate public functions merely underscores the dangers inherent in a system of expansive government subsidy.(1) </font></blockquote>
<p>
Clearly, the right to petition government to redress grievances should not 
be infringed.  Individuals and organizations using funds from the private sector 
should be encouraged to engage in the legislative and political process. It is an 
entirely different matter, however, to employ the coercive power of the federal 
government to force taxpayers to finance organizations which lobby Congress or 
other government entities.  It is every bit as unjust to force liberal taxpayers to 
fund organizations on the right as it is to force conservative taxpayers to finance 
organizations on the left.  The fundamental principle is that it should be 
anathema to force taxpayers to underwrite advocacy with which they disagree.           
<p>	
Taxpayer funding of advocacy organizations is wrong - fiscally, morally, 
and logically.  It is fiscally irresponsible to spend federal revenues on activities 
that provide no meaningful return to the American people.  It is morally wrong 
for the government to take sides in any public policy debate by assisting the 
advocacy activities of an elite few.  And it is logically wrong for the government 
to fund activities that often result in lobbying for increased federal expenditures. 
The reasons are summarized aptly by George Mason University professor James 
T. Bennett and Loyola College professor Thomas J. DiLorenzo in their 
comprehensive study, <i>Destroying Democracy</i>:
<p>
<Font Size="-1"><blockquote>A large number of  individuals with strong views can express their preferences by contributing funds to a group that promotes that issue.  With tax-funded politics, however, a small number of zealots with access to the public purse can obtain resources from government to advance its views even though few 
individuals in society share the groups philosophy.  Whenever government funds any political advocacy group, it effectively penalizes those groups that advocate opposing public policies and provides a distinct advantage to the group or groups that it favors in the clash of ideas.(2) </Font></blockquote>
<p>
<a name="fund"><h4>THE FUNDING OF FACTION</h4></a>
[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]
<p>
The Founding Fathers recognized the dangers of factions in a republic.  
James Madison wrote in <i>Federalist</i> Number 10 that "Among the numerous 
advantages promised by a well-constructed Union, none deserves to be more 
accurately developed than its tendency to break and control the violence of 
faction."  Madison defined faction as "a number of citizens, whether amounting 
to a majority or minority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some 
common impulse of passion, or of interest, adverse to the rights of other citizens, 
or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community."
<p>
What the Founding Fathers referred to as factions we now call special 
interests.   Instead of restraining factions, however, the federal government today 
subsidizes them.  This distorts the political process by favoring one faction over 
another and by nourishing a network of special interests - a welfare-industrial 
complex - with a direct self-interest in the growth of the welfare state.  The 
financial cost to the taxpayer is far higher than the amount funneled to these 
organizations.  Each one not only lobbies for its contract or grant, but also 
advocates for bigger, more expensive social welfare programs, further 
complicating efforts to put the nations fiscal house in order.  Moreover, while 
these organizations often claim that the money they receive helps the less 
fortunate, the reality is that it bolsters their own political power, perks, and 
prestige. 
<p>
The advocacy network and its leaders contribute to what author James Payne 
has referred to as a "culture of spending" in Washington which makes it 
extremely difficult to trim government programs: "Leaders of such federally 
dependent interest groups  should not be seen as representing independent 
citizen opinion.  They are quasi-governmental officials with a vested interest in 
the spending programs that benefit their organizations."(3)
<p>
Not every dollar given to an advocacy group goes directly to political 
advocacy activities.  However, federal dollars are fungible.  Every federal dollar 
frees private resources to be spent on political, lobbying, and other advocacy 
activities.  Moreover, federal funds make the organization appear to be a larger 
force in the political arena than it would if it were totally reliant upon private 
contributions.  For example, the National Council of Senior Citizens receives 96 
percent of its funding from the federal government.    
<p>
<center>
<img alt="NCSC Annual Revenue Graph" src="1040img.gif">
</center>
<p>
The NCSC is but one of many advocacy organizations receiving federal funds.  
Here are just a few other examples:
<p>
<ul>
<li>The AFL-CIO benefited from more than $2,000,000 between July 1993 and 
June 1994.  According to the <i>AFL-CIO News Online</i>, the AFL-CIO used the 
Memorial Day recess to increase pressure on Members of Congress with its 
"Stand UP" campaign: 
<p>
<Font Size="-1"><blockquote>In those [5 targeted] districts, the AFL-CIO provided radio ads and coordinators to work with local union officials and legislative action committees.  Other activity included direct mail, jobsite leafleting, phone call drives using the AFL-CIOs toll-free hotline, petition drives, town meeting attendance, and letters and columns submitted to local newspapers.(4) </Font></blockquote>
<p>
<li>Recently, the Service Employees International Union produced a newspaper 
advertisement opposing tax cuts and efforts in Congress to slow the growth 
of welfare and Medicare.  SEIU claims Congress is attempting to "loot" 
welfare programs and "steal" from low-income home-energy assistance to 
help finance "corporate special interests." The ad lamented the impact on 
Fannie Johnson and her family in Ohio.(5)  This labor special interest benefited 
from $137,000 in taxpayer funding in 1993 (for an "anti-discrimination public 
education campaign").  Terminating it would eliminate the tax burden of 
nearly 30 families just like Ms. Johnsons in Ohio.
<p>
<li>Families USA - a driving force behind the Clinton big-government health 
care plan, including the failed last-ditch attempt to revive it last summer 
through a nationwide bus tour(6) - received $250,000 from the taxpayers 
between July 1993 and June 1994.
<p>
<li>The Child Welfare League of America received more than $250,000 in federal 
funding, then turned around and launched an ad campaign to increase 
welfare spending.  The League ran an advertisement opposing the Contract 
With Americas welfare reform bill which charged that "More children will be 
killed.  More children will be raped."(7)
<p>
<li>The National Trust for Historic Preservation received approximately $7 
million from the federal government in FY 1994 - 22 percent of its budget.  
In the same year, the Trust "launched a lobbying campaign against the 
Disney project" in Northern Virginia.(8)   In 1993, it "lobbi[ed] Congress to 
expand the historic rehabilitation tax credit."(9)  The groups president, Walter 
Mondale's former chief of staff Richard Moe, said the full credit would cost 
"$1.4 billion over five years."(10)
<p>
<li>The American Nurses Association received nearly $1 million between July 
1993 and June 1994 from the U.S. taxpayers.  In 1994, the ANA endorsed the 
Gephardt health care plan and actively lobbied for it.  According to the 
unions own press release announcing this endorsement, "The American 
Nurses Association is the only full-service professional organization 
representing the nations 2.2 million Registered Nurses through its 53 
constituent associations.  ANA advances the nursing profession by ... 
lobbying Congress and regulatory agencies on health care issues affecting 
nurses and the public."(11)  The <i>Political Finance and Lobby Reporter</i> revealed on 
May 12, 1995, that two new ANA lobbyists had registered.
<p>
<li>The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, which 
received nearly $150,000 in the most recent grant reporting period, 
denounced the House welfare plan, saying it "will drive more families into 
poverty and turns its back on hardworking Americans who fall on bad times.  
This is the small print in their evil Contract on America."  AFSCME President 
Gerald McEntee went on to say that "AFSCME will continue to fight for real 
welfare reform that includes jobs at decent wages, child care, health care and 
education and training."(12)
</ul>
<p>
Actually, however, government funding of advocacy organizations can hurt 
their cause.  Well-grounded public policy institutions prosper from strong 
grassroots support backed by individual financial contributions.  Much like a 
profitable company, they can measure support by looking at how many people 
were willing to open their checkbooks for the cause:
<p>
<Font Size="-1"><blockquote>The plain fact is that political advocacy groups will not flourish on the basis of government subsidy.  Rather they will prosper only insofar as they develop financial roots in the polity.  Reliance on the government trough is no sign of the commitment of your adherents to your cause.(13) </Font></blockquote>
<p>
<a name="prob"><h4>NOT A NEW PROBLEM</h4></a>
[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]
<p>
Federally funded advocacy is not a new problem.  Congress recognized 
the potential for abuse more than 75 years ago when it passed a law prohibiting 
the use of federal funds for political advocacy.  Unfortunately, the prohibition 
was too vague, too lenient, and too weakly enforced.  Put simply, auditing of 
federal grants by the government does not provide the level of scrutiny needed 
to root out abuse.
<p>
The scope of the problem can be seen by examining the <i>Catalog of Federal 
Domestic Assistance</i>, published every six months by the federal government.  It 
details nearly every federal program from which eligible individuals, 
organizations, and governments can receive tens of billions of dollars in taxpayer 
funding.
<p>
For years, congressional offices have worked with constituents to help 
them find federal grants, in the process becoming very familiar with the <i>Catalog </i>
as a guide to sources.  But very few congressional staff employees have been 
aware of abuses in the grants process.  These abuses are long-standing. In 
testimony before the House Committee on Government Operations in 1983, 
Joseph Wright of the Office of Management and Budget noted that the General 
Accounting Office had found problems as far back as 1948.(14)
<p>
In the early years of the Reagan Administration, the OMB attempted to 
revise OMB Circular A-122 (originally issued in the final year of the Carter 
Administration) to redefine limits on "allowable costs" by federal grantees.  The 
revision, first released in January 1983, was widely criticized as overly broad, 
excessively burdensome, and unenforceable.
<p>
One of the focal points of the initial debates was the fact that the original 
OMB proposal apparently would have disallowed the use of any equipment, 
personnel, or office space for both federal grant and political advocacy purposes 
if at least 5 percent of the organizations resources was used for lobbying.  For 
example, a copy machine could not be used to produce flyers for a rally on 
Capitol Hill if it was paid for - in whole or in part - by taxpayer funds.  Many 
nonprofits objected to such clear separation between federal funding and 
political advocacy.
<p>
Months later, OMB Director David Stockman and General Counsel 
Michael Horowitz withdrew the original proposal and released a new draft with 
a more narrow definition of prohibited activities.  This watered-down version no 
longer drew a clear line between allowable and unallowable costs.  Instead, it 
specified a few examples of prohibited behavior, including a prohibition on 
reimbursement for conferences used in "substantial" part to promote lobbying 
activities.
<p>
Unfortunately, this effort to appease federally funded nonprofits and quell 
opposition in Congress was futile.  Because Congress signaled its clear 
opposition to working with the Reagan Administration to curb federally funded 
lobbying activities, despite the fact that all parties acknowledged such behavior 
was inappropriate, A-122 failed to improve substantially the restrictions on 
lobbyists billing Uncle Sam for their activities.
<p>
<a name="proh"><h4>EXISTING PROHIBITIONS ARENT WORKING</h4></a>
[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]
<p>
Federal law prohibits the use of federal funds for lobbying (18 U.S.C. 
Section 1913).  However, there is no clear set of guidelines as to specific 
prohibited practices.  In addition, numerous appropriations riders have been 
offered and approved in the past in an effort to curb federally subsidized 
lobbying.  The purpose of the Reagan Administrations attempt to create a more 
stringent version of OMB Circular A-122 was to tighten the gaping loopholes in 
existing law and to implement Congresss intent in passing lobbying prohibitions.
<p>
Circular A-122 drew on several distinct concepts to frame the new guidelines.  
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Taxpayers are not obliged to fund advocacy they oppose.</b>  The 
Supreme Court in 1977 ruled that taxpayers are not required, directly 
or indirectly, "to contribute to the support of an ideological cause 
[they] may oppose."  (<i>Abood v. Detroit Board of Education</i>)
<p>
<li><b>Freedom of speech does not depend on federal funding.</b>  In 1983, the 
Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the federal government "is not 
required by the First Amendment to subsidize lobbying .... We again 
reject the notion that First Amendment rights are somehow not fully 
realized unless they are subsidized by the State."  (<i>Regan v. Taxation 
with Representation</i>)
<p>
<li><b>The Internal Revenue Code does not alleviate the problem.</b>  The 
notice of the request for public comment on the second revision of A-
122 notes that current IRS rules threaten tax-preferred organizations 
only if they exceed defined limits on lobbying.  However, the limits are 
not tied in any way to the receipt of federal funds, leading to many of 
the same problems from which the 1919 law prohibiting federally 
funded lobbying suffers.
</ul>
<p>
Unfortunately, the firestorm created by the first proposed revision of A-
122 led to a second draft that watered down the tough initial provisions and 
failed to solve the problems outlined by the Administration in presenting its 
proposals.  The notice for public comment on the second proposal stated that its 
"purpose [was] assuring compliance with a myriad of statuory provisions 
mandating that no federal funds be used for lobbying purposes, and to comply, 
in balanced fashion, with fundamental First Amendment imperatives."  Despite 
the best of intentions, the revised A-122 did not meet these goals.
<p>
A particularly serious provision of the second revision was its 
enforcement mechanism.  A popular maxim in the 1980s was "trust but verify."  
OMB Circular A-122 relied on trust alone:  
<p>
<Font Size="-1"><blockquote>[T]he federal government will rely upon [the nonprofit employees] good faith certification of lobbying time below 25% .... Under the proposal, the absence of time logs or similar records not kept pursuant to grantee or contractor discretion will no longer serve as a basis of contesting or disallowing claims for indirect cost employees.</Font></blockquote>
<p>
In essence, this lack of verification of time spent on lobbying activities 
permits the individual to state that he is complying with the law even if that is 
not the case.  This is worse than the fox guarding the henhouse.  If a nonprofit is 
willing to violate the restrictions on advocacy, surely it will have no qualms 
about certifying it is in compliance with the law.
<p>
<a name="rest"><h4>TOUGHER RESTRICTIONS NEEDED</h4></a>
[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]
<p>
Tougher laws are needed to prevent the abuse of taxpayers funds by 
federal grantees.  There is no excuse for compelling John Q. Public to support 
political advocacy that he opposes.  It is fiscally irresponsible and morally 
indefensible. 
<p>
The following should be essential parts of any congressional efforts to 
curb current abuses:
<ul>
<li><b>Truth in Testimony.</b>  Witnesses testifying before Congress should be 
required to divulge in their oral and written testimonies whether they 
receive federal funds and, if so, for what purpose and in what amount.  
This will permit committees to view the testimony in an appropriate 
light.
<p>
<li><b>No Federal Funding for Advocacy.</b>  No organization that receives 
federal funds should be permitted to engage in anything but incidental 
lobbying activities, except on issues directly related to its tax status.
<p>
<li><b>No Bureaucratic Shell Games.</b>  No recipient of federal funds should be 
permitted to maintain organizational ties to any entity that engages in 
lobbying activity.  All sub-grantees should be treated as if they 
received the funds directly from the federal government.  Independent 
Sector, an organization representing hundreds of nonprofit advocacy 
groups, unwittingly indicated the need for this in a recent report: 
"Although the non-profit organization received a check from the local 
government, the local government may have received some or all of its 
funding for this project from a Federal Community Development 
Block Grant (CDBG)."(15)
<p>
<li><b>Meaningful Auditing.</b>  The Inspectors General of the various federal 
departments and agencies must investigate more thoroughly any 
abuses of current law, as well as new laws passed by the Congress.  
<p>
<li><b>Tough Penalties.</b>  The consequences for violating the prohibition on 
federally subsidized lobbying must be sufficient to discourage 
organizations from violating the standards.  Under no circumstances 
should any organization that willingly and knowingly violates the 
prohibitions receive further federal funding.
</ul>
<p>
Representative Robert K. Dornan (R-CA) has introduced H. R. 1130, the 
Integrity in Government Act, which would prohibit a recipient or paid 
representative of any federal award, grant, or contract from lobbying in the 
following circumstances:
</wl>
<p>
<ul>
<li>In favor of continuing the award, grant, or contract;
<li>In favor of the actual program under which the funds were disbursed;
<li>In favor of any other program within the broad department or agency; 
and
<li>In favor of continued department or agency funding.
</ul>
<p>
The Dornan legislation also prohibits tax-exempt lobbying organizations from 
receiving federal funds.  Representatives Bob Ehrlich (R-MD), Ernest Istook (R-
OK), and David McIntosh (R-IN) also are working on legislation to remedy this 
problem.
<p>
It is difficult to craft legislation that satisfactorily defines prohibited 
activities.  Moreover, any bill designed to redress these abuses must prevent 
organizations from simply establishing separate bank accounts and separate 
names.  To be effective, there must be a definite and complete physical 
separation between all federally and privately funded resources.
<p>
<a name="concl"><h4>CONCLUSION</h4></a>
[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]
<p>
Taxpayer-subsidized political advocacy represents pure fiscal folly and 
moral injustice.  No hard-working American should be compelled to finance 
lobbying activities with which he disagrees.  The Founding Fathers would be 
appalled at current federal grantmaking.  Thirteen years ago, <i>The Washington Post</i> 
editorialized:
<p>
<Font Size="-1"><blockquote>[W]e agree that there is something disturbing about organizations that strongly advocate positions many sensible people find politically or morally repugnant, acting at the same time as administrators of government programs.  It is easy to believe that the advocacy groups employees will sometimes proselytize the 
programs beneficiaries in ways we would consider inappropriate (though not unheard of) for a civil servant.  Advocacy organizations might also want to ask themselves whether they risk compromising their own purposes by accepting government money, and whether they want to assume the inevitable risk that it might be withdrawn suddenly for legitimate political reasons.(16)</Font></blockquote>
<p>
Abuse of federal grant funds must be stopped.  Tougher restrictions are 
needed to prevent lobbying organizations from obtaining some or most of their 
revenue from the American taxpayers.  Auditing and investigation of federal 
grantees by the Executive Branch must be strengthened.  However, a danger 
always exists that as long as government funds go to advocacy organizations, the 
"wall of separation" will be porous.  Moreover, the less fortunate would be 
assisted more directly by eliminating the middleman who "does well by doing 
good."
<p>
Without restoring integrity to government by ending federally funded 
lobbying, Congress and the President will continue to squander millions of 
taxpayer dollars each year.  Political patronage should have no place in the 
federal budget.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The federal budget provides numerous slush funds that can be used
to subsidize the lobbying and political activities of special-interest
groups. The agendas of these tax-subsidized groups tend toward
bigger government, more spending, and increased regulation. Every
American is forced to finance this system that allows well-connected
Washington-based groups to use taxpayer funds to advance political
causes to which many Americans object. Congress can put a stop
to subsidized politicking by refusing to fund the most egregiously
abused programs.
<P>
<b>Top Ten Federal Programs That Actively Subsidize Politics and
Lobbying<sup>1</sup></b><BR>

<P>
1. AmeriCorps $427 million<BR>

<P>
2. Sr. Community Service Employment Program $400 million<BR>

<P>
3. Legal Services Corporation $400 million<BR>

<P>

<BR>


<P><hr>
<b>Total&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	 $1.8 billion</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In 1995, Congress attempted to address this problem by ending
grants to groups that engage in lobbying. Unfortunately, the restriction
Congress approved applies only to one category of lobbying organizations.
Efforts to erect broader restrictions on taxpayer subsidies for
lobbyists, principally the Istook-McIntosh-Ehrlich Amendment,
were stymied. They should continue in 1996.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	While broad efforts to end &quot;welfare for lobbyists&quot; continue,
Congress also should identify and eliminate those programs that
serve most often to prop up special interests. The best way to
do this is to shut off the largest spigots of funding for big-government
activist groups. Ten programs stand out. Some have been slated
for reform by one or both houses of Congress, but no changes have
been enacted into law. All deserve to be eliminated outright.
<BR>

<P>
<b>1. AmeriCorps&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	 $427 Million</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In 1993-1994, <a href="http://www.cns.gov/">AmeriCorps</a> employed about 20,000 &quot;volunteers&quot;described as &quot;working all over America, helping people &#173;&#173; person to person.&quot;<sup>2</sup> In reality, a significant number of these
paid volunteers work in federal or state bureaucracies, government-funded
programs, or political action organizations<sup>3</sup>. Moreover, ignoring
the Corporation's mission statement to address the nation's problems
through direct community service, several AmeriCorps programs
have engaged in advocacy and direct partisan politics at the expense
of the taxpayers.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Section 132(a)(3) of the National and Community Service Trust
Act of 1993 clearly states that &quot;any approved national service
position provided to an applicant will not be used to perform
service that provides a direct benefit to any... partisan political
organization.... &quot; But in San Francisco, the AmeriCorps &quot;Summer
of Safety&quot; program organized 40 groups to rally against a
&quot;three strikes and you're out&quot; crime bill provision.<sup>4</sup>
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Elsewhere, one of the biggest abusers of AmeriCorps' mission was
a nonprofit group located in Cole, Colorado, which was supposed
to use its volunteers to help people in northeast Denver neighborhoods.
Instead, according to state records, leaders of the Cole Coalition
sent program participants to hand out political fliers directly
attacking a local City Councilman, Hiawatha Davis. &quot;The 'volunteers'
had to draft campaign fliers and distribute them door-to-door
in April and May [1995] when Davis and [Mayor Wellington] Webb
were fighting for re-election.&quot;<sup>5</sup> According to 21-year-old
volunteer Joseph Taylor, &quot;We realized there was something
politically partisan. The more we began to pose a threat to blowing
the whistle, the more they tried to pacify us. They kept saying...
this was a great position we were in, making public officials
accountable for their jobs.&quot;<sup>6</sup> Although the Cole Coalition
was stripped of its funding, the AmeriCorps program lives on &#173;&#173;
as does the potential for abuse.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In proposing the AmeriCorps program, President Clinton declared
that &quot;National service will be America at its best &#173;&#173;
building community, offering opportunity, and rewarding responsibility.
National service is a challenge for Americans from every background
and way of life, and it values something far more than money.&quot;<sup>7</sup>
Like many other government programs, however, AmeriCorps has not
lived up to its promise. Subsidizing political activism does not
qualify as responsible behavior. <BR>

<P>
<b>2. Senior Community Service Employment Program&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	 $400 Million</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Senior Community Service Employment Program (SCSEP) is operated
by the Department of Labor. It provides more than $400 million
in annual funding for senior citizen employment.<sup>8</sup> The stated purpose
of this program, authorized by Title V of the Older Americans
Act of 1965, is &quot;To provide, foster, and promote part-time
work opportunities (usually 20 hours per week) in community service
activities for low income persons who are 55 years of age and
older. To the extent feasible, the program assists and promotes
the transition of program enrollees into unsubsidized employment.&quot;<sup>9</sup>
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	States, national nonprofits, and territories are eligible to receive
grants. In reality, however, 78 percent (more than $320 million)
of SCSEP grant money is segregated from state funding to subsidize
nine national nonprofit organizations. The <I>Catalog of Federal
Domestic Assistance</I> states explicitly that &quot;The Department
[of Labor] annually renews grant agreements. There are no plans
to add additional organizations.&quot; Moreover, &quot;Awards
are not on a competitive basis.&quot;<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Fortunately, the FY 1996 House Appropriations Committee report
begins to address this problem. Although the program's funding
was reduced by only $50 million in the House proposal, the report
states that &quot;The Committee has funded the program under the
basic law rather than continuing the past practice of earmarking
78% of the funds for national contractors and 22% for the states.&quot;
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Even under this reform, however, the nine recipient organizations
are not prohibited from receiving funds. They simply are thrown
into the same pot as the states, and federal bureaucrats might
be able to award the grants in a similar fashion. To stop the
potential for abuse, these organizations should be cut off entirely.
<BR>

<P>
<b>3. Legal Services Corporation&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	 $400 Million</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Legal Services Corporation (LSC) was established by the Legal
Services Corporation Act of 1974 to provide free legal assistance
to the indigent in civil, non-criminal matters. Its origins lie
in President Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty, specifically with
the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO), which in 1965 began
making direct grants to local legal aid organizations.<sup>10</sup><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Corporation uses its budget (currently $400 million) to funnel
federal tax dollars to 323 private groups around the country.
These taxpayer-funded legal groups then engage in political and
lobbying activities, often at the expense of the genuine legal
services needed by poor people. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Legal Services suffers from an institutionalized ideological bias.
Its attorneys regularly promote racial preferences and illegal
immigration. Its grantees are sufficiently politicized to become
involved in congressional redistricting, litigation, and campaigning
on ballot referendum questions. Over the past 30 years, the LSC
has been the legal pillar of the welfare state. Through litigation,
advocacy, and lobbying, it has helped to generate hundreds of
billions of dollars in increased local, state, and federal welfare
spending and the addition of millions of people to the welfare
rolls<sup>11</sup>. It has sued to stop welfare reform in New Jersey and in
other states. It even has engaged in actions &#173;&#173; litigating
to prevent the eviction of drug dealers from public housing, for
example &#173;&#173; that harm the poor. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The LSC clearly has abandoned its mission to such a degree that
no meaningful reform can be enacted. There is only one way to
end this glaring abuse of the taxpayers' funds and trust: abolish
the LSC.<BR>

<P>
<b>4. Title X Family Planning&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	 $189 Million</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Perhaps a more accurate name for these multiple slush funds would
be &quot;Planned Parenthood Planned Giving Programs.&quot; Despite
the fact that much of Planned Parenthood's agenda is repulsive
to large numbers of Americans, this high-profile political organization
receives a substantial portion of its revenue each year through
government &quot;contributions.&quot; Planned Parenthood and its
affiliates join with a handful of other active organizations in
taking advantage of these costly grant programs. <BR>

<P>
The key components of Title X include:
<P>
<b>Family Planning Services/Umbrella Councils ($183 Million)</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Among the organizations funded under this heading are Planned
Parenthood of Wisconsin ($2.6 million), Planned Parenthood of
Minnesota ($2.3 million), the New Jersey Family Planning League
($4.2 million), and the California Family Planning Council ($11.7
million).<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	These nonprofit groups receive $62.6 million &#173;&#173; one-third
of the total annual allocation. However, much of the remaining
$120.4 million is likely to benefit similar nonprofits. According
to the <I>Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance</I>, &quot;Projects
include: (1) A State Health Department which subcontracts to service
providers throughout an entire State; and (2) a service provider
to serve several counties or a smaller geographical area.&quot;
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Accordingly, many states will subgrant or subcontract with nonprofits
that engage in lobbying all levels of government.<BR>

<P>
<b>Personnel Training ($5 Million)</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The stated purpose of this program is &quot;To provide training
to Title X project staffs; to improve utilization and career development
of paraprofessional and paramedical manpower in family planning
services, particularly in rural areas. &quot;<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The notice in the <I>Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance</I>
states that &quot;funds may not be used in programs where abortion
is a method of family planning.&quot; This prohibition notwithstanding,
at least 20 percent of these funds was allocated to Planned Parenthood
chapters and family planning councils that typically deal with
abortion and engage in legislative or political advocacy.<BR>

<P>
<b>Service Delivery Improvement ($500,000)</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The stated purpose of this program is &quot;To promote service
delivery improvement through research studies, and application
of knowledge.&quot; <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Examples of previous funding include studies of factors influencing
women to discontinue attending family planning clinics and studies
of particular family planning needs of underserved subgroups of
low-income women. In other words, the principal purpose of this
half-million dollar program is to discover why people are not
demanding even more government-subsidized services.<BR>

<P>
<b>5. National Endowment for the Humanities&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	 $180 Million</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The <a href="http://www.neh.fed.us/">National Endowment for the Humanities</a> actively promotes a
liberal political and ideological agenda. In recent years, it
consistently has funded politically correct projects, including
the highly controversial National History Standards that were
denounced by former NEH Chair Lynne Cheney and other serious scholars.
These so-called standards took political correctness to a new
level by ignoring major events in American history that fail to
bolster the liberal academic's world view. Simply put, the recent
work of the NEH has served to undermine support for Western civilization.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Abuse of federal grant dollars for political purposes is rampant
in the NEH's most prominent current project, the so-called <a href="http://www.neh.fed.us/documents/natcon.html">National Conversation</a>. At the cost of millions of dollars, the endowment
is subsidizing such special-interest groups as the National Council
on Aging, American Bar Association, and American Library Association,
none of which is any stranger to government grants. Once again,
the &quot;Beltway Bandits&quot; have managed to manipulate the
bureaucracy to tap the public purse.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In creating the National Conversation, NEH Chairman Sheldon Hackney
stated that he sought &quot;a national conversation open to all
Americans, a conversation in which all voices are heard in which
we grapple seriously with the meaning of American pluralism.&quot;
Apparently, Hackney believes that meaningful public dialogue is
possible only if the government intervenes and pays for it to
happen, and that the increasing number of Americans participating
in talk radio &#173;&#173; a largely conservative phenomenon &#173;&#173;
are not &quot;serious.&quot;<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The fact of the matter is that these so-called conversations are
simply a high-profile tool to promote a politically correct agenda.
The NEH describes the National Council on the Aging's grant, for
example, as directed partly toward financing &quot;short film
clips [that] will serve as a catalyst for discussion on topics
such as... crossing ethnic boundaries, and practicing politics.&quot;<sup>12</sup>
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Scattered throughout NEH documents are references to ethnic diversity
and &quot;equality and commonality.&quot; For example, the description
of the grant to the American Bar Association states that its purpose
is to foster<BR>
<blockquote>
<P>
more than one hundred nationwide conversations using legal cases
to explore the meaning of &quot;e pluribus unum&quot; (out of
many, one) through five topics: race, gender, affirmative action,
and socioeconomic equality; the place of religion and religious
expression in the &quot;public square&quot;; pluralism in public
schools and curriculums; immigration and American identity; and
controversial ideas and speech in a diverse society.<BR>
</blockquote>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The effect of establishing &quot;discourse&quot; based on such
an agenda inevitably is to encourage the perpetuation of a liberal
hegemony over American political life.<BR>

<P>
<b>6. Market Promotion Program&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	 $75 Million</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The stated purpose of the Market Promotion Program (MPP) is &quot;to
encourage the development, maintenance, and expansion of commercial
export markets for U.S. agricultural commodities through cost-share
assistance to eligible trade organizations that implement a foreign
market development program.&quot;<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The funds from the MPP go to support some of the largest and most
vocal special interests in the country. In 1995, for example,
MPP grantees opposed bipartisan efforts to reform farm subsidies.
They fought successfully against the effort to eliminate this
program outright, and they also fought reforms designed to decrease
taxpayer subsidies to farmers, particularly large corporate farms.
Once again, all of these self-serving efforts were subsidized
unwittingly by the American taxpayer.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The few grantees under the Market Promotion Program that are not
special-interest associations are large, profitable corporations
benefiting from a slush fund that moonlights as corporate welfare.
<BR>

<P>
<b>7. Senior Environmental Employment Program&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	 $45 Million</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Senior Environmental Employment Program (SEE) purports to
&quot;use the talents of Americans 55 years of age or older [to]
provide technical assistance to Federal, State, and local environmental
agencies for projects of pollution prevention, abatement and control.&quot;
Only private, nonprofit organizations designated by the Secretary
of Labor and on the &quot;approved list&quot; pursuant to Title
V of the Older Americans Act of 1965 may receive funding. The
approvals read like a laundry list of special-interest groups.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The annual appropriation for SEE is $45 million, spread out over
approximately 250 grants per year. No matching funds are required.
Funded projects often have provided senior citizens to EPA for
&quot;research and general administrative and clerical tasks,&quot;
as well as for surveys and monitoring projects.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This program provides a dual benefit to the promoters of big government
and increased regulation: Numerous senior citizen groups receive
subsidies for their lobbying and political activity, and the EPA
benefits from additional troops to enforce its regulatory agenda.
According to the Federal Assistance Awards Database System, virtually
every regional EPA office and every division within the agency's
headquarters receives support from these grants. This permits
the agency to evade existing employment caps &#173;&#173; without
anyone knowing.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	For example, internal EPA documents obtained by the Heritage Foundation
indicate that in March 1995, the agency's Region 10 offices in
Seattle had more than 50 employees from special-interest groups
on staff, including seven from the National Council of Senior
Citizens and six from the American Association of Retired Persons
(AARP). There is every reason to believe similar situations exist
in every other regional office, as well as at EPA headquarters
in Washington.<BR>

<P>
<b>8. Superfund Worker Training Program&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	 $32 Million</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This program provides nothing short of direct payoffs to unions
which, in turn, work with their allies in the environmental movement.
Authorized by the Superfund law, these grants purport to provide
&quot;practical health and safety training programs [for those]
who are engaged in activities related to hazardous materials.&quot;
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Much like its namesake, however, the Superfund Worker Training
program is a failure. Despite the billions of dollars spent on
Superfund itself, less than one-quarter of the most dangerous
toxic waste sites have been cleaned up. Why, then, train people
in failure? Millions of dollars are wasted preparing people to
clean up waste sites that never get cleaned up.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The nature of this program is demonstrated by its blatantly political
selection of grantees, which include many of the nation's most
powerful labor unions. (A selection of recent beneficiaries can
be found in the <a href="#appen">appendix</a> to this paper.) The Department is conducting
a program evaluation that should be ready sometime this spring.
It is hoped that this evaluation finally will note the potential
pitfalls of providing more than $25 million of $32 million in
total annual funding to organized labor.<BR>

<P>
<b>9. HHS Discretionary Aging Projects&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	 $26 Million</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This program, administered by the Administration on Aging, is
one of three programs authorized under the Older Americans Act
that serve to underwrite the activities of senior-oriented special-interest
groups, such as the 96 percent federally funded National Council
of Senior Citizens. The stated purpose of the Discretionary Aging
Projects program is &quot;to provide adequately trained personnel
in the field of aging, improve knowledge of the problems and needs
of the elderly, and to demonstrate better ways of improving the
quality of life for the elderly.&quot;<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	However benign its stated purpose, most of this program's funds
flow to organizations that promote government interventionism.
Grantees in 1994 included some of the major groups that opposed
efforts to reform Medicare, including the American Association
of Retired Persons, Families USA, and the National Committee to
Preserve Social Security and Medicare. Other grantees (like the
Child Welfare League of America) stand out not simply for their
political advocacy activities, but also because there is no clear
relationship between their missions and the field of aging.<BR>

<P>
<b>10. Telecommunications and Information Infrastructure Assistance&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;$25 Million</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Telecommunications and Information Infrastructure Assistance
Program (TIIAP) is operated by the <a href="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/">National Telecommunications and Information Administration</a> (NTIA) in the U.S. Department of
Commerce and is a key element of Vice President Al Gore's attempt
to impose central planning on the &quot;information superhighway.&quot;
The program gave out $24.4 million in FY 1994 and was slated to
dole out $36 million in 1995. In 1994, 92 grants were made. Last
year, 120 subsidies were given out to help numerous liberal groups
post propaganda on the information superhighway.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	According to NTIA documents, in 1994, Planned Parenthood Federation
of America received $300,000 to set up a &quot;nationwide on-line
information system&quot; for itself and all 164 of its affiliates.
Likewise, in 1994, a California organization called LatinoNet
received funding to &quot;establish a network of regional field
representatives&quot; and &quot;demonstrate a model for building
a national grassroots information system,&quot; among other things.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Organizations that filed proposals and applications for funding
in the FY 1995 process include Families USA, lead lobbyists for
Hillary Clinton's failed attempt at a government takeover of the
U.S. health care system; ACORN, which led noisy demonstrations
in Congress last year; the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation;
and Citizens Fund, an affiliate of Citizen Action, an aggressive
grassroots lobbying organization. While these groups did not receive
funding last year, they clearly are interested in the program
and no doubt will seek subsidies in the future.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The most egregious abuse of the TIIAP program was discovered last
fall. A $200,000 grant was provided to an online bulletin board
called <a href="http://www.handsnet.org/">HandsNet</a> to establish a training center and recruit additional
advocacy organizations to its ranks. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; An examination of postings on the <a href="http://www.handsnet.org/">HandsNet Internet site</a>, makes
it clear that the group's principal purpose is political advocacy.
The site has been used in recent months to fight welfare reform
and the Istook-McIntosh-Ehrlich Amendment to end taxpayer-subsidized
political corruption, among other issues. HandsNet offers three
key information services: Action Alerts, a Weekly Digest that
summarizes the Alerts, and daily updates on key issues. Members
of HandsNet include such liberal special interests as the Children's
Defense Fund, the Alliance for Justice, OMB Watch, and Families
USA.<BR>

<P>
<b>CONCLUSION</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Government funding of political activism is indefensible. Yet
hundreds of groups now receive government grants which are used,
and used effectively, to subsidize their political activities.
Americans deserve better treatment of their hard-earned tax dollars.
Funneling millions of dollars in public subsidies to special interests
to subsidize political advocacy qualifies as a significant abuse
of the public's money and the public trust.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Congress should continue to consider ending all government grants.
But in the meantime, it can reduce government-subsidized politicking
significantly by eliminating funding for those programs most abused
by political activists.<BR>

<dl>

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96b1.html">February 7</a>
<dd>This show brought you a look at the 104th Congress and what 1996 could 
entail for them. 
<p>
<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96b2.html">February 14</a>
<dd>This show celebrated Valentine's Day with a new slant on what many consider to 
be true romance: abstinence. Saving sex for marriage seems to be an increasing 
trend, and this show introduced some people who explained this 
not-so-old-fashioned phenomenon. 
<p>
<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96b3.html">February 21</a>
<dd>This show discussed one of the hottest family
issues nationwide and in Washington, D.C., parental rights.  What
are parents privy to and excluded from when it comes to their
children's lives and sometimes life-changing decisions?
<p>
<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96b4.html">February 28</a>
<dd>This week's episode discussed how the media influences 
society today. From television to movies to music to the Internet, 
we are surrounded by the media and its control over what we see, hear, 
and sometimes the opinions and decisions we make. Does the media take 
such a responsibility seriously?

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96c1.html">March 6</a>
<dd>This show brought you a unique discussion about the 
diverse strategies to combat our Nation's war against drugs, and the 
experts who joined in the discussion range from a former lieutenant colonel 
in the U.S. Army, a psychiatrist who specializes in the clinical and 
policy areas of drug addiction, and a former state drug czar.

<p>

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96c2.html">March 13</a>
<dd>This show took a look at a sensitive, life-enhancing 
and life-changing issue for parents and children: adoption. 
If adoption is viewed as the best alternative to unwed 
pregnancy by the majority of Americans, why is it so hard for 
couples to adopt children in our own country?

<p>

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96c4.html">March 27</a>
<dd>This week's show brought you clips from the 
Washington Briefing which was hosted by FRC on March 18

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96d1.html">April 3</a>
<dd>This show brought you more highlights from the briefing 
with more speakers and insightful discussions on our current government, 
the government to come, and how America's schools are affected.

<p>

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96d2.html">April 10</a>
<dd>This week's show discussed a matter which could destroy marriage
and family as we know it by redefining marriage to include gay
unions.

<p>

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96d3.html">April 17</a>
<dd>This show presented some insider information from those 
who attended the recent 1996 National Education Summit. Will 
the solutions that came out of it help your children?

<p>

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96d4.html">April 24</a>
<dd>This show discussed an issue not often seen in secular news 
coverage: religious liberty and Christian persecution around the 
world. It showed how thousands of people are sacrificing their 
lives for a faith which they refuse to deny because their government 
demands it. Could America be headed in that direction?

insights into motherhood.

<p>

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96e3.html">May 15</a>

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96f1.html">June 5</a>
<dd>This episode took you to the Stand for 
Children rally, whose name exemplifies what we all hold 
dear, America's children. But the important issue is 
not just that we stand for children but what we stand for 
and who is standing, government or parents.

<p>

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96f3.html">June 19</a>
<dd>Unfortunately, fatherhood cannot claim the revered 
position it once held in our national culture. This episode 
dealt with the harsh reality that thousands upon thousands 
of America's children suffer from the absence of their own 
fathers.

<p>

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96f4.html">June 26</a>
<dd>Parental rights have slowly diminished in our schools and 
our culture. This episode helped us to understand why parents 
are fighting for their inherent rights to lovingly guide their 
own children.

<dd>In this episode, we alerted parents to a new affront
against America's children as a recent court case was discussed 
which opened the world of pornography to our children over 
the Internet.  Are we losing the battle to protect our 
children from pornography in cyberspace?

<p>

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96g2.html">July 10</a>
<dd>This episode shared some key information regarding 
the Defense of Marriage Act and some sound reasoning from a 
variety of experts on why marriage should not be destroyed 
and reshaped to include homosexual couples.

<p>

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96g3.html">July 17</a>
<dd>This show presented more experts who brought
their well-researched insights into the defense of marriage, 
and there was personal testimony from a former 
homosexual man who now helps homosexuals who wish to leave 
that lifestyle.

<p>

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96g4.html">July 24</a>
<dd>This episode presented a completely different 
marriage tragedy, its possible collapse, as seen by author 
Maggie Gallagher, who wrote the recent best seller, 
<i>Abolition of Marriage</i>. Has our country discarded this 
founding union?

<p>

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96g5.html">July 31</a>
<dd>This show discussed RU-486, the abortion pill, and how 
this abortion method could lead to severe physical, emotional, 
psychological and legal troubles if it receives FDA approval.

Marty Dannenfelser - Assistant to the President for Government Relations,

</ul>

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to a special live edition of 
<i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i>. I'm your 
host, Kristi Hamrick.  Tonight, we will bring you election 
analysis from a family perspective.  What does this split 
decision between the White House and Congress mean about the 
policies that will affect your family?

<p>

We've got some special guests to answer that 
question, but none more important than you, and we'll be 
taking your calls throughout the show.

<p>

With me tonight is former Presidential candidate 
Ambassador Keyes, who is founder and chairman of the board 
of the Declaration Foundation.  He is a syndicated columnist 
and host of his own nationally syndicated radio show, 
<i>America's Wakeup Call</i>.

<p>

Also with us is Marjorie Dannenfelser, the 
president of the Susan B. Anthony List, which is a 
nonpartisan, pro-life political action committee founded to 
help elect pro-life women to public office.

<p>

And another member of the Dannenfelser family 
joins us, her husband Marty, who leads the Family Research 
Council's Government Relations Department.  He heads the 
pro-life fight on Capitol Hill.

<p>

Welcome, each of you, to the show.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Thank you.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I appreciate your joining with us, 
and we will look forward to hearing what our viewers have to 
say to you.

<p>

Ambassador, let's start with you.  As you evaluate 
what just happened in the election -- Bill Clinton has 
returned, the Republicans have the House and Senate -- what 
do you think the take-home message is of the 1996 election?

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: I think it is pretty clear.
Bob Dole attempted to run a campaign that was strictly based 
on economic issues against a President whose great 
vulnerabilities were on the moral front. It was an insane 
strategy.  I said so for months.

<p>

In the last three weeks, four weeks, he tried to 
shift and talk more about what they called the character 
issues, but it was out of context.  He hadn't addressed the 
moral crisis that this country faces, and so, stupidly, 
pollsters were able to ask people, "Which do you think is 
more important, the issues or character?" when in point of 
fact character is an element of all the important issues, 
and that distinction showed that the homework hadn't been 
done.

<p>

The relationship between America's crisis in the 
family, in the schools, on the streets, the crisis of crime, 
even in the area of health care, you can see the impact of 
behavior that is resulting from the moral breakdown in the 
society.  Every one of these issues is in fact a reflection 
of the moral crisis, and to make a separation between the 
issue of character, the moral issues, and the tremendous 
issues that we face as a people, particularly as they affect 
our family and our kids, this is insane.  But I think it 
reflected the deficiency of the Dole camp.

<p>

On the House side, I think what we saw, however, 
was a confirmation of what began in 1994.  Essentially, the 
conservatism of America was confirmed in this election by a 
President who felt he had to run as a conservative, even if 
it meant lying all the time, and by a Congress that, in the 
end, is in the hands of an even more strongly conservative 
and strongly morally conservative Republican coalition than 
was the case before the election.

<p>

So I think, all told, the outcome of the election 
is a strong message that we had better start taking the 
moral issues seriously.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And everybody was a pro-family 
conservative.  I woke up to NPR one morning, National Public 
Radio, to hear Bill Clinton explain how the liberal, Paul 
Wellstone, is really a conservative.  I thought, boy, 
conservative values really must be playing if Paul thinks he 
has to be one.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

Marty, when you look at the Congress, do we have a 
more conservative Congress?  It would appear from the 
campaigns, anyway, that everyone is a conservative today.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, on paper, I would say 
certainly the Senate is more pro-family conservative.  You 
might look at who won and who lost in the House and see a 
narrow diminution of the strength in the House.  But you had 
a gap between the House and Senate last time, whereas the 
House was the real stronger body taking the lead on those 
issues, and some of them would get tied up in the Senate.

<p>

So I think the House is probably still 
sufficiently strong to push forward on many of these issues 
and now, hopefully, with some of the House members going 
over to the Senate, like Tim Hutchinson and Sam Brownback 
and so on, to add to that strength, they will be able to 
carry through and send more issues down to Mr. Clinton, who 
will have an opportunity to then show us what a pro-family 
conservative he is by signing some of these bills that we 
heard about on the Christian radio ads, and so on.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Tim Hutchinson has got to be a great 
story. I mean, here you've got Bill Clinton from Arkansas, 
and then you have, in his own Senate seat, he cannot put a 
Democrat in there.  We get not just a Republican but a 
conservative Republican.  We don't have a William Weld kind 
of Republican in that chair.  What do you make of that?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, you've had people like 
that getting elected ever since -- in Arkansas -- ever since 
Bill Clinton got elected President.  Mike Huckabee got 
elected lieutenant governor immediately after Bill Clinton, 
and now he is the governor.  He succeeded in the wake of a 
scandal involving the governor.  He was prepared to run for 
that Senate seat himself, but when the incumbent governor 
dropped out, he had to go fill it, and Tim Hutchinson was 
able to step into that void and fill that seat, and the 
trend in Arkansas is very much towards pro-family 
conservatives.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You know, Marjorie, you track the 
pro-life issue, and speaking for myself, personally, I had 
to be disappointed that the pro-life issues, they certainly 
motivate a lot of people at the grass roots, but at the 
Presidential level, there was almost a vacuum.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Yes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What do you see on the pro-life 
front in this election?

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: On the Presidential level, you 
mean, or on the congressional level?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: On any of the levels.  Where is the 
good news for us?

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Well, in several of our 
congressional races, abortion was a very high-profile issue, 
and the Susan B. Anthony List only picks candidates that are 
going to be very aggressive on the issue.  So where there 
are opportunities, our candidates were very forthright.  And 
certainly in some districts it is going to play better; in 
some districts it is just going to play not as well.

<p>

One of our best pieces of news is that Jo Ann 
Emerson, who ran for her husband's open seat in Missouri, 
beat the Emily's List candidate, whose name is Emily 
Firebaugh -- how about that?  And I understand she was.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

We really found that when our candidates used 
especially the partial-birth abortion ban issue, which no 
human being alive can be for partial-birth abortions, for 
the first time they had the courage to talk about it, a lot 
of candidates had the courage to talk about it because they 
knew that everyone was behind them, and their opponents were 
in retreat on that issue, because we focused on challenges. 
We were challenging incumbents, and all of them had voted 
against the ban.  So it worked well in those elections.

<p>

The problem was that there was a very concerted 
national effort to oust all those great Republican pro-life 
women who ran and won with our help, and they were 
successful in many cases.  So we had sort of a wash.  Picked 
up two, lost two.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I was watching CNN today and was 
very interested to hear that the pro-life issue is not 
influential anymore.  Do we agree with that?

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: I think there is going to be a 
lot of brainwashing garbage going on in the media right now 
in order to camouflage the truth of this election.  But I 
think that the aim of many things that happened this time 
around on the part of an establishment that included a lot 
of Republicans, meaning no offense, was to try to drive the 
moral issues, not just the pro-life issue but the moral 
issues, out of American politics.  They did not succeed.

<p>

I think there was a concerted effort to do that 
during the Republican primary season.  That failed.  I think 
that it was clear at the convention that an effort was made 
from the podium to lie about the real nature of the 
Republican Party and its issues, and that effort from the 
podium succeeded, with the result that Bob Dole never 
consolidated his base and ran one of the poorest campaigns 
we have ever seen in terms of an ability to consolidate 
support within the Republican ranks.

<p>

So I think that there was thinking that said we 
are going to use this election to get rid of the influence 
of these moral conservatives, and it simply did not work.  
And indeed, I think the election results, particularly with 
the defeat of prominent pro-abortion liberals, as I call 
them, the Colin Powell liberals, like William Weld, like 
Zimmer, I think it really put a wrench in the works of those 
people who had written their stories already about how this 
election proved that the moral issues were no good, the pro-
life issue was no good, Republicans were going to have to 
broaden their base by picking the likes of Susan Molinari 
and Christine Todd Whitman.  All of that is laughable in the 
face of the results of yesterday's election.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The Northeast was great.  I mean, 
there is Bob Smith, who struggles to a victory, and then 
you've got the Zimmers and the Welds who don't.  I mean, 
Zimmer took Christine's formula.  Marty, what did you think 
about that?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, it was interesting the 
way the networks were so quick to pronounce Bob Smith dead 
last night.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: They all projected that he was 
defeated early on in the evening -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: They had to resuscitate him.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: -- and he cast himself as Mark 
Twain today, that reports of my death have been greatly 
exaggerated.  But they all made these projections, and here 
was Bob Smith, who had been the champion of the partial-
birth abortion (ban), who had taken heat for talking about 
this on the floor of the Senate, which was not proper.  You 
know, that was not the type of thing you should do on the 
floor of the Senate, after all.  And yet they didn't, in the 
end, really get him.

<p>

And they called another state, the whole state of 
North Carolina, going the other way early in the evening, as 
well, and that came out five points in the opposite 
direction.  So it was very interesting.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: I don't know if Bob Smith saw 
it, but I thought that there was a real Providential irony 
in the fact that Bob Dole wanted to be the one who could 
hold a newspaper that had printed a false headline, and to 
do that, he abandoned essentially the prominent position of 
the moral issues.  Bob Smith stuck with those issues, and he 
could have held a copy of the Washington Post that said, 
"Smith Loses."

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes, he could have.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: I mean, God gave him that 
victory because he had stood firm on the right issue.  I 
deeply believe this is true.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to have to talk more 
about this in a second.  When we return, we will open the 
phone lines so you can join the discussion with tonight's 
very special guests.  You can reach us by the phone, 1-800-
5000-NET, or by fax at 202-544-2405.  Please stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from
the Family Research Council</i>, where we are coming to you live 
to talk about the election results.  I am joined by 
Ambassador Alan Keyes; Marty Dannenfelser, who heads the 
Family Research Council government relations operation; and 
Marjorie Dannenfelser, who is head of the pro-life PAC, the 
Susan B. Anthony List.  You can call us at 1-800-5000-NET or 
reach us by fax at 202-544-2405. Welcome back, everyone.

<p>

Marjorie, I was intrigued by a comment you made at 
the break about what we should have learned about how to 
choose our issues.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Yes. I was just following up 
on what Alan was talking about earlier about how candidates 
choose what they talk about in campaigns, and when they 
decide to open the newspaper and look at whatever poll data 
might happen to be out that day and choose that to talk 
about, they are destined to lose, because it never gets 
below the epidermis and you never reach the heart.

<p>

That is what happened to Bob Dole, and it happens 
to candidates around the country, too.  It is not just on 
the Presidential level.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It is true.

<p>

We have our first caller on the line.  We have 
Carmen from Flagstaff, Arizona.  Carmen, do you have a 
question for our panel of guests?

<p>

FLAGSTAFF (AZ) CALLER: I have two comments.
Yesterday when I was going to vote, and I asked a lot of 
people that said, "We're not going to vote" -- people in the 
office, people everywhere -- "We're not going to vote.  You 
can buy the electoral votes, so my vote doesn't count."  
They said, "The unions already bought those votes, no matter 
how people vote, so it doesn't really matter." They 
wouldn't even think about going to vote.

<p>

The other comment is that -- I said it in 1992.  
King Solomon said it in the book of Proverbs.  "When the 
wicked are in authority, transgression increases."  So don't 
be too surprised if our moral values go all the way down, we 
see more terrorist attacks, more of everything.  That is 
what has been happening in the last four years.

<p>

But my biggest concern is the electoral vote, what 
people said yesterday.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That's a really good point, Carmen. 
You know, Marty, we were looking at that this morning a 
little bit, about the fact that even though the unions put 
all that money in, and a lot of people had the same idea 
that Carmen did, that a lot of the freshmen survived despite 
$35 million or $40 million worth of onslaught.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: They did. They went out there 
and in some cases created a backlash.  They were pointing 
out that this was a lot of money coming in just to distort 
what they had really done. These were outside groups that 
really had no interest in informing their own constituents 
but rather to create this distorted image to the more 
general public, and it did create some backlash in certain 
areas.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: I think there was a concerted 
effort, too, that dovetailed with what the newspapers and 
the television people were doing.  I can't help but think it 
was no accident that you had these wildly exaggerated poll 
numbers, as it turned out, and that in fact the most 
accurate pollster turns out to have been Zogby, who all 
along showed a much tighter race, going at one point to less 
than four percentage points.  And if that had been the kind 
of polling that had been characteristic, then all along it 
would have been portrayed as a tight race with Bob Dole 
fluctuating, and I think we would have seen a very different 
mentality among voters in terms of participation, interest, 
because they would not have had the sense that it was a 
forgone conclusion.

<p>

So the union money plus the media presumption 
about the outcome, I think, helped to induce apathy.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I think it did, too.

<p>

Let's take another quick caller.  We have on the 
line Chuck from Ohio.  Chuck, what do you have to say?

<p>

XENIA (OH) CALLER: Good evening.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Hi!

<p>

XENIA CALLER: Thanks for taking my call.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Thanks for calling.

<p>

XENIA CALLER: I am a conservative Christian. I 
am also a retired UAW member, so I was involved in unions, 
too, and I am just so glad that I am not working now or I 
would really be raising Cain, because I am one of the 40 
percent that voted Republican.

<p>

I saw Mr. Keyes on <i>Cornerstone Live</i> back in March.
Do you remember that?

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Yes.

<p>

XENIA CALLER: You were on there with Elizabeth 
Dole, and it was right after your little escapade in 
Atlanta.

<p>

Well, I voted for Buchanan in the primary, but I 
wanted to make two points.  I was just wondering why 
Elizabeth Dole didn't have a little more influence with her 
husband in this partial-birth ban.  Now, I was wondering 
when it was ever going to come up.  It finally came up.  I 
followed him all over the country on satellite, on KU band, 
and he addressed it to just a couple thousand here and a 
couple thousand there.  He never really nationally exploited 
it.

<p>

The other point I would like to make is, right 
after the election last night, on CBS, Dan Rather thinks the 
Republican Party must pull together and move to the center 
and away from the religious right.  I can't see where he is 
coming from.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What is so ironic about that -- I 
want to hear what you have to say about that, Ambassador -- 
but the voting numbers were clear.  I know we have all heard 
them, that the best bloc of the GOP was the people of faith.
I mean, how could Dan Rather say that?

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: This is why Rather wants us to 
move to the center, so we'll lose all the time.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

I was sitting next to, what is his name, Bob 
Fromme(?), I think, who was Torricelli's campaign 
consultant, and he was also responsible for that despicable 
commercial that featured David Duke against the civil rights 
initiative in California.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes, that is right.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: And his advice to the 
Republican Party is that you had better go with the Whitmans 
and you better leave -- and I hope you'll follow Keyes' 
advice and do all of this moral stuff because then you'll 
lose.  No, it's not true.  They want us to abandon the moral 
issues because then we'll lose consistently, as Dole just 
did, and I think that is what Dan Rather and his cronies are 
up to. They would love to see Republicans behave every time 
the way Dole and Kemp behaved this time because we'll get 
creamed as they got creamed, in the debates and before the 
electorate. That is their wish, that we should do the wrong 
thing. I think if we ignore them and instead build on the 
base of strong moral conservatism, there is a majority 
there, including especially those people, some of whom sat 
out the election this time because they weren't very 
enthused --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes, definitely.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: -- some of whom we still 
haven't awakened yet to move out of the pews and into the 
voting booth.  But we're going to.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: I find it interesting, every 
four years or sometimes even on the two-year cycles, the Dan 
Rathers and people like that have the same conclusions.  
They wring their hands about negative campaigns.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That's right.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: They profess that the 
candidates are not talking about the issues.  But as you 
study the news, you find out that the sound bites of the 
candidates talking about the issues get shorter and shorter. 
I think they averaged about six or seven seconds in this 
most recent campaign cycle.  And then it is the same advice. 
It was the religious right again.  No matter how strong of a 
margin they got with them, they are the ones who were 
causing them this problem.  It is always the same 
conclusion.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It seems to me that Bob Dole and 
Bill Clinton ran the campaign that the media would like -- 
no issues, lots of fluff, absolutely nothing of substance --
and we had the lowest voter turnout since, what, the 1920s?

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Yes. About a million dollars 
of consultant fees will pay for that.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Their idea of negative is very 
strange, too.  I mean, if you said anything at all, however 
true, about Clinton or about Democrats that brought out a 
lot of the negatives, which are there in the record, then 
that was negative campaigning.  But if you had a filthy 
piece like the Schrum(?) commercial, which basically used 
David Duke in order to do what, produce a 60-second slur 
that called everybody who supported the CCRI a racist, that 
is name calling, but they didn't consider that negative 
campaigning.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And they paid him to do that, too.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: That is right.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: I think it is important for 
people to realize how much is working against elected 
officials to do the wrong thing, you know, to make bad 
decisions, even when they are really well grounded in their 
faith when they arrive, they are still going back to their 
districts all the time, everything in Washington trends 
towards making the wrong decisions. The consultants, who 
just basically they worked on a congressional staff once and 
now they have the great position of telling other people 
what to do, I mean, they are not necessarily qualified to 
tell candidates how to run a good campaign. The 
consultants, the atmosphere of Capitol Hill.

<p>

Without the real active involvement of people out 
in the country, that will prevail, without, first of all, 
the faith and then the really active involvement of people 
out there.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It involves people.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Yes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we will 
bring you more about the battle to protect pro-family 
issues.  Stay with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>, where we are coming to you live 
with Ambassador Alan Keyes; Marjorie Dannenfelser, president 
of the Susan B. Anthony List; and political expert Marty 
Dannenfelser of Family Research Council.  And we would also 
like to hear from you, so you can please call us at 1-800-5000-NET.

<p>

Ambassador, we were just talking about the fact 
that it is not so often that our issues are not advanced; 
they are not even -- you know, no one takes the time.  No 
one wants to do the fight, giving up before we even get 
started.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Well, I think you see a lot of 
that.  In fact, it is induced in a way by the media, and 
then it affects the minds of folks.  I thought it was a real 
disease on the Dole campaign, where they seemed very anxious 
to give up, I mean Scott Reed giving an interview to The New 
Yorker a week and a half before the campaign ended, that 
came out the day before the election, saying that, "I told 
Bob Dole every day, I put the poll numbers in front of him 
and said, 'You know, Bob, we might not win this one.'"

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I know.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: And I am thinking, what a thing 
for a campaign manager to be doing.  And the very night of 
the election, Nelson Warfield, two hours before the 
California polls closed, issued a statement praising Bob 
Dole for his courage in defeat.  And I am thinking, this is 
crazy, what is he up to?

<p>

But there was this mentality of preemptive 
surrender, and I am glad, actually, that at a personal level 
-- his staff apparently was very defeatist, but Dole went on 
fighting right to the end, and I think his willingness to 
put up a strong fight, not to back off and kind of collapse 
the way, unhappily, Bush did in 1992 was very important in 
helping Republicans to keep the Congress, because it buoyed 
up the party around the country psychologically; it helped a 
lot in California to keep things from getting out of hand 
there; and I think it helped to maintain the sort of 
firewall that prevented Clinton's victory from expanding 
into control of the Congress.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It could have saved the House and Senate.

<p>

We have a caller on the line from historic Valley 
Forge, Pennsylvania.

<p>

VALLEY FORGE (PA) CALLER: Oh, hi.  How are you?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Hi. Thanks for joining us.

<p>

VALLEY FORGE CALLER: When they wanted the Jews to 
repent, they showed the bodies, shriveled, and when they 
wanted people to send to Ethiopia, they showed the bloated 
bodies.  Why aren't Christians putting up billboards with a 
manger scene, with an empty manger, with the words, "I'm 
sorry, Joseph, we couldn't afford him"?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Good point.

<p>

Marjorie, you work on this pro-life issue.  What 
kinds of messages do you find really motivate people when 
you are working on them?

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Well, that was very touching, 
and that was a beautiful way to put it.

<p>

I find, and we have a unique stance at the Susan 
B. Anthony List among PACs.  We really require of our 
candidates that they do two things, that they project the 
justice of changing laws to protect the unborn, and they 
project the mercy and the compassion that we have to reach 
women where they are.

<p>

I mean, the reality of this issue is that women 
have abortions, and when we have women in public office who 
are talking to women on their own terms and saying that they 
have a sense for where they are -- I mean, I think it is 
very important.  It is very important to have that 
connection, and I think it is important to have women 
discussing it in those terms.

<p>

I think what resonates the most, frankly, just on 
a debate level -- I think that ad is a great idea that the 
caller called in with -- but is, what is it?  You know, 
whenever I am debating the issue, what is an abortion?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What are you choosing?

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: What is it? I mean, what is 
that "thing"?   You have to address that before you can move 
on.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Let's take one more quick caller.
We have on the line Kay from Wyoming.  Kay, do you have a 
question or a comment for our distinguished panel?

<p>

RIVERTON (WY) CALLER: I do. I have a couple 
things.  First of all, on the issues, our issues do not lend 
themselves easily to sound-bite campaigning, and until we 
break through that format that we are permitted, we are 
going to have problems getting our point across.

<p>

Dr. Keyes was pointing out about the polls, and 
you have to remember, the American press uses polls as a 
weapon, not a tool.  They try to use polls to change 
people's opinion or to frame it.  They don't use it for a 
measuring device.

<p>

My question, also, is -- the big question is, did 
the RNC learn anything this time around, and what are they 
going to foist upon us in 2000?  Are we going to have 
another left-leaning candidate and more empty issues?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes, hours of conversations have 
gone into that.  I would have to say one thing, though.  I 
think that is the strength of NET as a network, to have an 
expanded conversation, and radio shows like yours.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Yes. Well, I think with 
respect to the RNC, we are just at the beginning of what is 
going to be, I believe, a very intense battle within the 
Republican Party between the grass roots, which I believe is 
overwhelmingly Reagan conservative -- pro-life, morally 
conservative, fiscally conservative, interested in 
reclaiming power from the central government and rebuilding 
the institutions of local self-government and civil society. 
I think that is the essence of the true conservatism at the 
grass roots in the Republican Party.  That is going to be 
pitted against the party elitists, the people who controlled 
the podium at the convention this time around, the people 
who had planned consistently a strategy aimed at dumping the 
moral issues, at emphasizing money above everything, and at 
trying to promote Colin Powell, Christine Whitman, others 
who basically represent the abandonment of the Republican 
Party's moral heart. We are at the beginning of that 
struggle.

<p>

I think that for the caller and for others around 
the country, what they have to realize, I think, is that in 
the next several years, we are going to have to commit 
ourselves at the grass roots to lighting fires that can be 
seen from every horizon so that nobody in the Republican 
Party structure or leadership can mistake the true sentiment 
that exists in the party at the grass roots, because it is 
going to require a lot of action; it is going to require a 
lot of persistence and perseverance on the part of people 
who are moral conservatives to keep the Republican Party 
where it belongs and to do what is necessary.  By the year 
2000, we must transform the leadership of the party.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Marty?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: On that point, I think the 
caller identifies a problem for pro-family conservatives 
that people in the major news media, the three or four major 
television networks, the newspapers on the Eastern -- you 
know, we know the newspapers, <i>New York Times</i> and others -- 
do not agree with us on these cultural issues.

<p>

But a candidate, particularly a candidate for 
President of the United States, has a unique opportunity to 
speak directly to the people.  Alan Keyes has done that, 
Ronald Reagan did that. Ronald Reagan faced a very hostile 
press.  We do hear some revisionist history from the press 
now about how nice they were to Ronald Reagan.  But those of 
us who remember the Reagan Presidency know otherwise.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That's right.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Bob Dole and Jack Kemp had that 
opportunity in this campaign, and they had a moderator in 
those debates who was really a very fair-minded journalist 
who gave them some open-ended questions like, "Tell us about 
Clinton's character," or, "Tell us about the moral crisis in 
the country today," between the questioners from the 
audience in the second Presidential (debate), and they had a 
minute and a half or so to articulate these positions, and I 
don't think they did it.  They came around in circles back 
just repeating economic theory and things like that, and it 
was just absurd.

<p>

The other thing is, federal candidates can 
completely control the content of their advertising.  They 
are getting $60 million in federal funds to run a campaign. 
They can choose to do a 30-second spot, they can choose to 
do a one-minute spot, they can choose to do a five-minute, 
or Ross Perot did some half-hour spots, and they can speak 
as short or as long, within certain limits, as they want to, 
and as long as their resources will hold out, they need to 
identify the message and articulate it to the people.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And we are going to have to demand that.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: And Bob Dole obviously didn't 
do that, and he paid the price for it.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That's right.

<p>

We're going to have to talk more about this in a 
second.  Following this commercial break, we will continue 
our discussion about yesterday's election results and how 
they affect you.  Please stay with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. Joining me tonight to discuss 
how yesterday's elections affect pro-family issues is 
Ambassador Alan Keyes, a steadfast leader in the pro-family 
movement, both inside and outside the beltway.  Also with us 
are Marjorie and Marty Dannenfelser.  Marjorie is the 
president of the pro-life PAC, the Susan B. Anthony List.
Marty heads Family Research Council's government relations 
efforts.  We are taking your calls at 1-800-5000-NET.

<p>

Coming back, Marty, a lot of us have been talking 
about who is going to be RNC chair.  Haley Barbour says he 
is stepping down.  Is this the kind of power struggle that 
pro-family people need to watch?  Where is the leadership 
going to come from?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, there are many different 
factions of people around the country, and people have 
formed their own coalitions.  They will look at who the 
members of the Executive Committee of the Republican 
National Committee are in the 50 states around the country 
and try to formulate a strategy for reaching them.

<p>

I think that is something; if people can have an 
influence on that process, it is probably worth doing.  But 
I don't think we should allow ourselves to become fixated on 
that, because the ultimate way that you nominate a candidate 
is at the grass-roots level, is to send delegates to the 
national convention, and it is the delegates who ultimately 
nominate the candidate -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: People who manage leadership.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: -- and then the candidate who 
sets the tone for the party and for the convention and for 
the campaign.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The Bush tone kind of was in our mouth this time.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: I do think it is important, 
though, right now to try to work towards someone who is not 
going to be pushing what was, as I said, a conscious 
strategy of jettisoning the moral issues, which Haley 
Barbour was very open about.  I mean, he went around the 
country telling everybody who would listen for a while there 
that we had to get that pro-life plank out of the platform, 
we had to put these issues aside, and they were divisive, 
and all of this.

<p>

We don't need that.  What we need is someone who 
is going to articulate in a persuasive way the reasons for 
the positions that the Republican Party takes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: TO explain what we believe.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Exactly, and to do it in a way 
that will make sense to people and make them realize that 
the things we talk about are the issues.  They are not 
separate from the issues, as the media tries to imply.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Let's take a quick caller.  We have 
John on the line from the great state of Texas.  John, hi.
Do you have a comment or a question?

<p>

MIDLAND (TX) CALLER: Good evening. How are you 
doing?  I've got a quick comment, and then I've got a 
question for Alan.  I've heard all day long on the radio 
that women voted for Clinton because of abortion rights.  If 
that's true, I really feel sorry for a lot of these women.
I have Catholic friends -- I am Catholic and I even have 
Catholic friends that I know voted for Clinton, and I really 
feel sorry for them.

<p>

Alan, I was also at <i>Cornerstone</i>. I voted for you 
in the primary, and I saw you on TV last night, and you said 
something about you weren't a good speaker and you cheated.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Me?

<p>

MIDLAND CALLER: Keep on cheating, brother. We love it. We love you.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Oh, I was joking.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

MIDLAND CALLER: Where does your show originate from?

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: The show originates from 
Rosslyn, Virginia.  We are on 35 stations now around the 
country and building.  So, hopefully, we will reach into 
your area sometime soon.  I hope so.

<p>

MIDLAND CALLER: Thanks a million for your show.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Can I comment for a minute, 
though, on this gender gap thing?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes, the gender gap.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Before we even start to take it 
seriously.  I think it's a phony issue.  I do not believe 
there is a gender gap.  I think the gender gap is in fact a 
false symptom of something else.  And the simple fact of the 
matter, which nobody wants to really dwell on but which is 
the truth, is this:  Take Hispanic and black women out of 
the mix, and the gender gap evaporates.  It is not there.

<p>

And what does that mean?  It means you don't have 
a gender gap.  The gender gap is actually a symptom of the 
fact that we have large minority groups, Hispanics and 
blacks, who are captives of the Democratic Party; that 
amongst the white electorate, Republicans and Democrats 
compete pretty evenly still in terms of their ability to win 
the allegiance of voters; but that when you continue to get 
these lopsided majorities amongst Hispanics and blacks for 
Democrats, that produces a distorted outcome.

<p>

I think that is a very telling fact.  I am going 
to refuse to talk about this gender gap thing anymore 
because I think it is all a lie.  If one alteration makes 
the gap go away, that means that the true cause of the gap 
is not gender, it is something else, and this something else 
in this particular case is in fact racial politics, the 
politics of terrorizing minorities, which I think has been 
once again practiced in this election year by the Democrats.

<p>

But I also think it is going to change, because 
the Democrats have lost their base in the Congress which 
they used to buy off the leadership in the minority 
communities, and I think, over time, without the gravy 
train, they are going to have a very hard time continuing to 
dangle things they can't deliver in front of a coopted 
leadership, and people in the community are going to say, 
"Well, wait a minute.  We'd better start making our peace 
with these Republicans because, otherwise, we won't be part 
of the political process anymore."

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That is a fascinating analysis, 
because in <i>USA Today</i> and a Wirthlin poll I saw today all 
agree with that statement that you just made, that when you 
take minority women out, all the other things kind of break 
out evenly.

<p>

And in fact, Marty, is it not accurate that we 
have seen women more pro-life than men, generally, that 
women are more motivated for their concern for life?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: There are. There are more 
women who seem to vote on that issue, but on balance, more 
of those women vote on the pro-life side than on the other 
side.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: I don't know.  I think it is 
tremendously insulting to women to say that if you are of a 
certain gender, you are automatically going to vote -- you 
are going to have this opinion on this, this opinion.  We 
are thinking individuals that differ on all sorts of things, 
and it is more -- my vote has more to do with my core 
beliefs, what I believe in; also, my situation.  We have a 
family.  You know, things like that, not because I am a 
woman, because I am a human being.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I think you are right.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: You know, the thing that I 
found striking, two things were true.  One, the lie about 
the gender gap very much influenced the thinking of the 
strategists in the Dole campaign to such an extent that they 
made foolish errors. The Susan Molinari pick was the 
stupidest thing they could have done for keynote speaker, 
except maybe for Colin Powell.  But why?  Because they 
wanted to reach out to Catholics. And what did they do? 
They put a pro-abortion Catholic on the podium who 
absolutely insulted the convictions and work of the 
Catholics who would lean toward Republicans because of their 
pro-life sentiment.  It was insane.

<p>

So Bob Dole ended up getting all the votes of pro-abortion Catholic 
women, right?  That's why he won the election.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: That's right, absolutely.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: He couldn't get those votes, 
but the votes he could have gotten, the strongly committed 
pro-life Catholics, were instead insulted by this notion 
that a pro-abortion speaker speaks for them.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: See, that is what is funny about 
that.  There was no big tent until Ronald Reagan pulled in 
pro-life Catholics and working-class Americans who felt that 
the Democratic Party was becoming liberal and insulting to 
their values.

<p>

The big tent -- I mean, you hear the Haley 
Barbours and Romsfields(?) of the world talking about it.
You would think they created it rather than they just 
benefitted from coming under the flaps.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Well, they didn't even 
understand it.  They are still talking as if the big tent 
has something to do with money.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Yes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Right.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: And it does not. The big tent 
had to do with the fact that the moral culture of the 
Democratic Party was hijacked by radical left-wingers who 
moved away from the traditional values of the American 
people and lost a lot of people amongst the union workers, 
amongst the ethnic groups, amongst the Catholics, who simply 
were not going to abandon their faith and their principles.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Yes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We will come back in a second.  When 
<i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we will take more calls and continue 
our discussion with tonight's special guests.  Please stay 
with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to tonight's live 
edition of <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i>.
I am honored to be joined by Ambassador Alan Keyes and 
Marjorie and Marty Dannenfelser, both long-term political experts.

<p>

We would also like to hear from you.  You can 
reach us at 1-800-5000-NET.

<p>

We have a caller on the line, Robert from 
Albuquerque, New Mexico.  Robert, hi.

<p>

ALBUQUERQUE (NM) CALLER: Well, good evening.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Good evening.

<p>

ALBUQUERQUE CALLER: This is the first time I have 
watched your show.  I have watched NET for a while.  But I 
like it so far.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Well, good. Thanks.

<p>

ALBUQUERQUE CALLER: I have two questions.  One 
you have actually partially answered.  Maybe Alan could add 
more to it.  That is, why did the Catholic vote go the way 
it did?  Two, what do you think is going to happen to the 
Republican hierarchy after actually -- I mean, it is pretty 
much common knowledge that they picked Bob Dole, they gave 
it to him, they got him through the primaries, and he lost 
the White House.

<p>

And then I have a comment, if I may.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Why don't you give us your comment 
really fast and then let's get to Alan's answers.

<p>

ALBUQUERQUE CALLER: Oh, okay.  Over the years I 
have dealt and struggled with abortion.  When it first came 
about, I went, "Yippee."  Then as I grew older and wiser, I 
realized that something was wrong here.

<p>

But the argument for abortion has always been, 
you're killing a baby, and that's true.  But I have taken on 
another tactic.  I have looked at these people who are pro-abortion, 
and I said, what gender actually benefits from 
abortion?  And the answer is men.  Men only benefit from it.

<p>

I am beginning to hear a little more about this, 
or talk this way in the media, not very much.  Do you think 
that -- or maybe my suggestion would be that you people 
would take the same course and that abortion does not 
benefit women.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It is interesting.  Polling data 
indicates that single men are the biggest proponents of 
abortion, which I think there is a little self-interest 
there.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Yes.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Oh, definitely.  I think they 
are very anxious to escape their responsibility toward their 
children, and so they are willing to kill the child and 
burden the woman with this awful psychological burden for 
the rest of her life that is involved in this, and we are 
not protecting.

<p>

In terms of the Catholic vote, one, I think we 
always have to remember that we are dealing with a situation 
where Catholics were overwhelmingly voting for Democrats 
until Ronald Reagan came along, and even Reagan's success 
meant that we moved from, what, 20 percent of the Catholic 
vote or less up to around 40, and even during Reagan, this 
is what we reached.  So we are not talking yet, at least, 
about getting the majority of the Catholic vote.

<p>

But I think, as I said, one mistake that was made 
in this election was that Bob Dole thought he was going to 
reach out to Catholics.  They said, "Oh, you've got to reach 
out to the Catholic vote."  And, of course, there was a 
great opportunity.  The Catholic hierarchy, for the first 
time that I can remember, actually came forward in an 
election year against a sitting Democratic President, and 
they were more Catholic than Democrat.  And for those of us 
who are Catholics, this was breathtaking, and I was so 
pleased to see it happen.

<p>

Now, what did that mean?  It meant a great 
opportunity, but to do what?  To reach out to pro-life 
Catholics and pull them in more strongly into the Republican 
cause.  And so what does Bob Dole do?  He chooses Susan 
Molinari, a pro-abortion, outspoken, rabidly pro-abortion 
Catholic, to give the keynote speech, and he thought this 
was going to help him with Catholics.  He's insane.

<p>

What it did, I think, was to take a lot of people, 
and I know, because as I went around the country speaking, I 
have found it infuriated a lot of people.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Oh, it did.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: They just felt deeply insulted 
that he simply didn't understand what was going on, who they 
were, and as a result, I think he actually may have hurt 
himself at that point and not really recovered in terms of 
the perceptions of a lot of the pro-life Catholics and I 
think, also, pro-life Christians who were not Catholic, who 
just felt like, what is this man trying to tell us?  Doesn't 
he understand who his people are?  And the answer, I think, 
was, unhappily, no, he did not, or at least his advisers 
didn't.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, I think that Bob Dole is 
fundamentally an honest and decent person, but his whole 
aura throughout this campaign seemed very calculating.  The 
debate over abortion in the Republican platform was very 
much, now we're going to have it this way, I'm going to do 
it this way, and we have to reach out to the moderate women 
and we can't offend them, so we're going to have this 
tolerance language in there.

<p>

And then he never talked about CCRI for a while 
until, all of a sudden, the last few weeks of the campaign, 
he acknowledged, yeah, we're going to talk about that 
because that's a wedge issue.  And then he didn't answer the 
question when Jim Lehrer asked him about Bill Clinton's 
character during the debate in front of 40 or 50 million 
people, and then he decided to go out on the campaign trail 
and conduct a discussion with the people in his audiences, 
"Should I get tough in the next debate?" and so on.

<p>

Just everything looked so calculating that people 
had to start wondering, well, what does this guy really 
believe in?  I think that is what came across, that every 
position he seemed to be taking was based on some political 
calculation.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Rather than on what he believed.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: And it may very well be that 
Bill Clinton made his share of calculations, but at least 
when he was out on the stump, he was talking about how 
issues connect with people's personal lives.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Ironic as it may seem, I think 
some people -- and I am not saying they were right in this 
-- but they seem to prefer a sincere liar to an insincere 
honest man.  And I have to tell you that it's a dilemma, 
isn't it?

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: But don't you think that argues for 
something that I think we would be in agreement about, that 
people should stand up for something?  I think we would call 
them to stand for pro-life, pro-family values, but the 
politicals and the Dan Rathers and the Peter Jenningses say, 
"Don't stand for that much because that really offends 
people," when clearly, it draws them.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: I think the chief problem 
among candidates is just wanting to be liked.  It is a very 
basic human need.  But if you are not driven by your core 
beliefs, that just takes over.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: I also think the media is very 
manipulative, because we were talking earlier about negative 
advertising.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: And the truth of the matter is, 
when you actually look at election results, challengers and 
others who are faced with tough fights, they only win when 
they are able to show people that an incumbent is not voting 
their views and values.

<p>

Now, the media calls that negative.  It is 
actually just truth-telling.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That's right. It's a report card.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: If somebody has gone to 
Congress and voted in a way that betrays the values of their 
constituents -- you have liberals like a Barbara Mikulski 
pretending when they go to the Eastern Shore of Maryland 
that they are conservatives and respect family and all of 
this, meanwhile voting for everything that people there 
hate.  Well, if you want to beat somebody like that, you've 
got to tell people what she is about and what she stands 
for.  And they want to stigmatize that as negative 
advertising, and the only time -- the only time -- when that 
sort of thing is really, really bad, in their eyes, and you 
absolutely must not do it is when you are telling the truth 
about Democrats.

<p>

Now, of course, if you do the same thing and fill 
your commercials with lies, which is what the AFL-CIO did, 
they told untruths about the Republican Congress, but that 
was not characterized as negative advertising.  It's 
amazing.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Isn't that funny?  Demagoguery was okay.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Yes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: As long it was on Medicare.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, they were fortunate the 
Democratic members of Congress, and to a certain extent Bill 
Clinton, that they had surrogates, in a sense, doing their 
dirty work for them.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Weren't they, though?  They had the union money.

<p>

I would love to talk a little bit more.  I would 
like to thank all my guests, and we are going to have to 
have you back.

<p>

More about how you can receive information 
regarding issues affecting you and your family when <i>Straight
Talk</i> returns.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Thank you for joining us here at 
<i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i>. If you 
would like to receive more information about Family Research 
Council, our guests this evening, or the topics we 
discussed, please call us at 1-800-225-4008.

<blockquote>



 <LI>Bill Clinton has charged Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle  with the unenviable assignment of negotiating a settlement with Congressional Republicans on the partial-birth abortion ban. His task: get the GOP to exempt  from the ban women whose "health" might be adversely affected by carrying their children to term.  Call it Mission Impossible. Pro-life Republicans know better than to fumble this issue; the Supreme Court has defined "health" so broadly that it includes emotional well-being and maternal youth. And, as Sen. Rick Santorum (R-Penn.) points out, "this procedure would never be used in an emergency," as it takes three days to perform. But given the Republicans' obvious intransigence, it seems peculiar that the President would be so eager to revisit this losing issueunless he fears that the 105th Congress will succeed in overriding his ban. This is a valid concern: Senate Republicans fell only nine votes short of overruling the President in the last term, and in the meantime they have picked up two more seats. Moderate Democratsthose uncomfortable having their names associated with infanticidewill be less likely to succumb to White House arm-twisting when their President is a lame duck, and some have re-election campaigns of their own to worry about in 1998. The hitch is that the President will try to turn the issue against the GOP, chastising its refusal to sign on as gridlock and indifference to women's concerns. 
If Republicans shield their ears from this Sirens' song, however, the public will recognize Clinton's desperation strategy  for what is. Then Congress might just get that override Clinton so fears.

 <LI> For twelve days in November, French truck drivers went on strike demanding early retirement, shorter working hours, and more pay. They did not merely refuse to work, as is their right, but set up over 200 blockadesat ports, on freeways, and around major cities and oil refineries. Road transport was massively disrupted, stocks of food and gas ran low, and foreign truck drivers, held hostage in the blockades, were compelled to live in their cabins without washing. One British driver who protested was admitted to intensive care after being severely beaten up by French truckers. Throughout the entire crisis, the government insisted that it would not "use force" to break the blockades. It thereby admitted that it was not prepared to fulfill its duty to uphold the rule of law. The settlement with the truckers will cost $200 million, and the country now faces hundreds of millions of dollars in claims from companies abroad who were severely hit. The French economy also suffered severely for the second time in a yearfrom a strike. But this is merely the inevitable tribute which a decadent political system must pay to any interest group willing to trample the common good.

<P>
 <LI>The suspense if over. The winner of the Bad Writing Contest, sponsored by <I>Philosophy and Literature</I>, a journal at Johns Hopkins University, is the following sentence from Roy Bhaskar's <I>Plato etc: The Problems of Philosophy and Their Resolution</I>: "Indeed dialectical criticism realism may be seen under the aspect of Foucauldian strategic reversalof the unholy trinity of Parmenidian/Platonic/Aristotelian provenance; of the Cartesian-Lockean-Humean-Kantian paradigm, of foundationalisms (in practice, fideistic foundationalisms) and irrationalisms (in practice, capricious exercises of will-to-power or some other ideologically and/or psychosomatically buried source) new and old alike; of the primordial failing of western philosophy, ontological monovalence, and its close ally, the epistemic fallacy with its ontic dual. . . ." Mr. Bhaskar's stem-winder goes on for 58 more words, but you get the drift.

 Last month President Clinton came clean on Bosnia, finally revealing that 8,500 U.S. troops would remain past the original December 20 deadline. The original deployment of 35,000 Americans had "succeeded beyond our expectations," he said, but a follow-on force, more limited in size and mandate, was required for another 18 months to ensure political stability. IFOR (Implementation Force) will be renamed SFOR (Stabilization Force). The problems, needless to say, are manybeginning with Congressional anger at Clinton's denials before the election that any such extension was planned. More  important, the political provisions of the Dayton Accords, which aim at creating a unitary, multi-ethnic Bosnian state, are beginning to unravel. U.S. training and equipping of the Bosnianswhich the President had promised Congresshas barely begun, leaving them still dependent on foreign troops. The President may get his way, given the difficulty of cutting off funds and overriding a veto, but he compounds all his risks, at home and in Bosnia, unless he keeps his promise this time and gives the Bosnians the wherewithal to defend themselves.

<LI> A study published recently in the <I>American Journal of Public Health</I> suggests that racial discrimination by whites against blacks causes high blood pressure in blacks. Curiously, it was among blacks who were unaware that they had suffered discrimination that the effect was most pronounced. Dr. Nancy Krieger explained that this was a consequence of "suppressed or internalized response." The study did not address the effect that black-on-white crimewhich according to Irving Horowitz in the January 1995 issue of <I>Society</I> in 60 times greater than white-on-black crimehas on the health of whites.

 <LI>Brian Peterson and Amy Grossberg are the 18-year-old college freshmen who went to a motel in Delaware so that Amy could give birth to their child, then tossed him in a dumpster, where he was found, dead, the next day. The pair have been charged with first-degree murder, which could carry the death penalty. But why is what is they did so much more heinous than what a doctor might have done a few hours earlier, in a partial-birth abortion? The best line on this ugly affair belongs to George Will: "Could Delaware choose to execute the two by inserting scissors into the bases of their skulls, opening the scissors, inserting suction tubes and sucking out their brains? Of course not. The Constitution forbids choosing cruel and unusual punishments."

 a conservative Republican. The only reason I didn't vote for Barry Goldwater was because I was nine years old at the time. I am for medical marijuana because of my politics. But I'm also for it because I've had to use it.
<P>
As a political journalist, I mark the milestones of my life by election cycles. On the eve of Ronald Reagan's election I got married. On the eve of Bill Clinton's I got testicular cancer. The treatment was straightforwardoperation, followed by a rather harsh form of chemotherapy. Any chemotherapy is harsh, because all chemotherapy is poison. You're dumping poison into your bloodstream, killing millions of cells, in order to kill the thousands of malignant cells, which will not recover. Because it is poison, the body wants to get rid of it. That's why chemotherapy causes nausea. To deal with this, I took the latest anti-nausea drugs, including Zofran, and I also did self-hypnosis and mental imaging. These all worked to a point. But beyond that point, I needed extra help, and so I smoked marijuana.
<P>
I had smoked marijuana maybe ten times in college, during the Seventies. I even inhaled. I stopped because I found I didn't like smoke, or being high, or the conversation of pot-heads. I turned to it when I got cancer because marijuana gives healthy people an appetite, and prevents people who are nauseated from throwing up. None of my doctors or nurses at New York University Medical Center, or Memorial Sloan-Kettering, discouraged me from doing this. They had all had patients who had used marijuana to fight nausea, and who had reported good results. I had good results too. Because of the marijuana, my last two courses of chemotherapy were almost nausea-free.
<P>
There was only one problem-I had to become a criminal to do this.
<P>
Cancer patients are not the only people in this bind. AIDS patients who have the wasting syndrome report that marijuana gives them an appetite again. Glaucoma patients find that it arrests the deterioration of their eyes. People with chronic migraines, epilepsy, and multiple sclerosis use it to relieve their symptoms. A good summary of all these experiences can be found in <I>Marihuana: The Forbidden Medicine</I>, by Lester Grinspoon MD, and James B. Bakalar. Dr. Grinspoon is a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, and the book is published by Yale University Press, so this is not something downloaded from the Internet. But any sick person who wants to use marijuana to help himself has to break the law. I'm a member of the media elite, who lives in Manhattan, so I wasn't at high risk. But plenty of sick people get arrested, and plenty of them go to jail.
<P>
There are three common arguments against the medical use of marijuana, all of them faulty.
<P>
The first is that THC, the main active ingredient in the drug, is available in a legally prescribable pill form. But the pill has problems. It's expensive. Because it's a pill, and therefore slower acting, people have trouble adjusting the dosage; they often find themselves taking too much. It also seems to cause high levels of anxiety and depression. In my case, I thought treating nausea with a pill was not a bright idea.
<P>
The second argument is that smoked marijuana has never been tested scientifically. This is not entirely true. One test was done at UCLA in 1970 for the Los Angeles Police Department, which wanted to prove that pot smoking dilated the pupils. The researchers found that it contracted the pupils; they also discovered that marijuana relieved pressure within the eyeball. This is why marijuana is useful in treating glaucoma.
But it is true that it is difficult to test marijuana. That is because the government makes it so. The case of Dr. Donald Abrams at San Francisco General Hospital is instructive. Dr. Abrams is an AIDS researcher who wants to test the efficacy of smoked marijuana in treating the wasting syndrome. For more than two years, he tried to get marijuana legally from the National Institute on Drug Abuse for his experimentsto no avail. So doctors cannot prescribe marijuana because it hasn't been tested, but doctors aren't allowed to do any tests. This is a classic Catch-22.
<P>
The third objection is that by legalizing marijuana in one area, we will be setting a bad example to a society engaged in a war on drugs. In fact we will be setting no example at all. The availability of morphine in hospitals is not the reason people smoke crack. A hairless cancer patient with an IV tube in his arm is not a come-on for a pusher.
<P>
The connection between the issue of medical marijuana and the war on drugs runs the other way. The reason we don't allow medical use is because of the spill-over of an extreme war-time psychology. <I>National Review</I> has taken a stand on the war on drugs, but it is not relevant here. If you think the war is wrong, then the ban on medical marijuana is simply one symptom among many of its excess and folly. If you think the war is right, then the ban is an irrelevant and over-zealous off-shoot, like fighting the Kaiser in World War I by changing the German names of Midwestern streets.
<P>
I want to end by addressing my fellow Republicans. My support for medical marijuana is not a contradiction of my principles, but an extension of them. I am for law and order. But crime has to be fought intelligently, and the law disgraces itself when it harasses the sick. I am for traditional virtuesI support the Christian Coalition, and I supported the Moral Majority. But carrying your beliefs to unjust ends is not moral, it is philistine. Most important, I believe in getting government off people's backs. We should include the backs of sick people trying to help themselves.
<P>
My cancer is gone now; I was lucky. God forbid that anyone in this room should ever need chemotherapy. But statistics tell us that many of us will. Let me assure you that, whatever you think now, or however you vote, if that moment comes to you, you will turn to marijuana. Extend that liberty to your fellow citizens.

<font size=+3>I</font> <font size=+1>WOULD</font> have written this review sooner, but my computer broke down. I am not sure why it went dead, but since it did so just after I punched it, I would guess that there was some sort of connection. Why did I punch my computer? To punish it, of course. I had recently gotten on the Internet. After crawling -- not surfing -- along for about an hour and a half in search of some specific item of information, I had come just within reach of what I wanted when a stupid little screen display popped up and declared that Netscape, suffering from sensory overload, had had the cybernetic equivalent of a nervous breakdown. It was then that I punched my laptop.
<P>
In <I>Life on the Screen: Identity in the Age of the Internet</I>, Sherry Turkle presents us with a somewhat romanticized vision of the evolving interaction between computers and people. She notes that she has named her computer Miss Beautiful -- a sobriquet for her daughter -- and she tells of one of her students who named a computer program that organized her daily schedule after an  ex-boyfriend (``I love to see him do my menial tasks''). To me such personification is totally alien, even if I confess to feeling a little sorry for having acted aggressively against a machine that had served me irreproachably for the past year. Though I refuse to personify my computer, however, I do spatialize it. That is, as I peer into the blue, lacustrine depths of the Windows program, with its delightful frieze of parti-colored icons along the top, I feel as if I were floating in a post-modern swimming pool somewhere on Ischia or Capri. In other words, I feel at home in my computer and I am comfortable and happy there.
<P>
Still, that does not qualify me as a ``computer person,'' and I even take a little pride in not being one. This was one reason I had delayed for some time before subscribing to an Internet service. Another reason was that I failed to see what consequence this technology could possibly have for my life, why I really needed it. What finally convinced me to subscribe was the prospect of sending and receiving e-mail, not to mention a commercial in which Barry Farber seemed to suggest, if I understood him correctly, that I would essentially be able to launch intercontinental ballistic missiles from the intimacy of my bedroom.
<P>
I was soon undeceived. The first thing one notices about the Internet is that it has been vastly overrated. Though you will have heard of the Information Super-Highway, what awaits you is rather a high-tech single-lane dirt road where an excess of traffic has brought transportation almost to a standstill. Though you will also have heard about ``surfing'' the Internet, the gliding swiftness implied by that word will mean little to those who seem rather to limp or stumble than to surf. And to the extent that the surfing analogy has any validity, it is only in the sense that any moment a big wave -- as in more data than your fragile modem can handle -- will overwhelm the whole contraption.
<P>
The second thing one notices is that the Internet is the subtlest thief of time. By making you wait for each parcel of data you want, it steals a minute here and four minutes there until, before you know it, two hours of your life are gone beyond recall. And during this period of waiting, because these deposits of time are so tiny, you are unable to engage in any other activity. Add to this the fact that, once you arrive at the site, you are apt to find a poorly written document whose loopy, time-consuming graphics are as appealing as public-access cable television in all its ranting, unedited profusion. There are many polished web sites, but most of these turn out to be little more than advertisements for providers of commercial goods and services, or they are documents provided by non-profit organizations. The idea that one can surf through the shelves of the public library may one day become a reality, but we are very far from that now.
<P>
The Internet works in two ways. By typing in a web address, you can go directly to a specific site that has information that you know you want. But to surf the Internet is different. This suggests going along for the ride and not quite knowing where you are going. You do this by typing in the name of the subject or person you want to research. A moment later, the search mechanism, in my case Netscape, applies its various inscrutable criteria to come up with the nearest matches to what you seek. Naturally I began by typing in my name to see how many people on the Internet had mentioned -- dare I hope it -- my articles or my book. Here I ran into one of the most common problems with the Internet. The searcher cannot give you the object itself, but only matches of greater or lesser probability and a synopsis of each site. Thus when I entered the name James Gardner, it told me that it had found 86,754 Jameses and 23,456 Gardners and then proceeded to give examples in which the two words occurred in the requisite proximity. Unfortunately my name is not an uncommon one, and so I had to get through several entomologists and chiropractors, two naval engineers and a masseur before finding any reference to myself.
<P>
For some time I continued in this way to putter around on the information dirt road, accomplishing little and gradually coming to understand that the Internet, for all that people have said about it, is a more or less total waste of time and a not inconsiderable waste of money.
<P>
<font size=+3>A</font><font size=+1>ND</font> it was at precisely that moment that something happened which caused me suddenly to appreciate what everyone has been talking about for the last two or three years. What I understood was that the Internet can be viewed as a massive encyclopedia. But whereas all earlier encyclopedias, simply by virtue of their existing as physical objects, were in a sense dead and out of date as a precondition of their very existence, the Internet by contrast is the Encyclopedia of NOW. As it happens I am finishing up a book on fringe groups, a subject which the Internet is uniquely qualified to tackle. I found at my fingertips abundant information about flat-earthers, Andrea Dworkin, snuff films, Queer Nation, the John Birch Society, creationism, and Islamic Jihad.
<P>
Another thing the Internet teaches you is that, no matter how obscure your interests, there are other people out there in cyberspace who are as passionate about them as you are. Though I know very few people whose interest in Latin is as energetic as my own, I soon found that I could correspond in that language with a group of college men in the Netherlands as well as an old professor in Finland and someone else in South Africa. What I find important and emblematic about this fact is that the futuristic Internet can be an agent by which the past is preserved and reinvigorated.
<P>
When I understood that, I confess that I had something of a conversion regarding not only the Internet, but also the great information revolution which is said to be getting under way. As of this moment mankind is entranced by the possibilities of computing. The almost obsessive insistence with which people seem to talk of nothing else, with which the Internet haunts our business pages, publishers' catalogues, and the graphics of advertisers and television producers, suggests that something almost incalculably big is afoot. To some degree this fascination resembles the interest in the atom 50 years ago and in space exploration 25 years ago. But neither of these technologies ever really promised, and surely neither ever produced, a direct and material effect upon our daily lives. With the Internet, by contrast, there is a nervous, giddy sense that, at long last, we are approaching some kind of critical mass. There is a buzz running so loud through all the breadth of human society, an electric excitement so jolting and so unexpected, that one could be excused for thinking that we are on the verge of some great new age. And though books, if we believe the prophets of doom, are soon to vanish from the earth, there is nothing publishers seem to find more attractive or salable than volumes that promote and explain this instrument of their allegedly imminent demise.
<P>
The <I>People</I> magazine approach to the information revolution can be found in <I>Road Warriors</I>, by Daniel Burstein and David Kline. For these two investigative journalists, despite a useful introduction that reveals their deep understanding of what is at stake, the information revolution is essentially a re-enactment of earlier heroic ages of capitalist free-enterprise. But instead of the Fisks and the Goulds, we have shakers and movers ranging from John Malone and Ray Smith to Viacom, Sprint, and the Federal Communications Commission. Nevertheless, the authors are too hard-headed and rationalistic to be taken in by the euphoria of the revolution at hand, or to allow that enthusiasm to affect the tenor of their reportage.
<P>
Far different is <I>The Road Ahead</I>, by Bill Gates, the prophet, if not the Messiah, of the information movement. His book can be read, if one is cynically inclined, as an extended sales pitch for Bill Gates. But Mr. Gates, despite his open and irrepressible enthusiasm for computing, has written a surprisingly candid and useful book. For Gates, the future of computing is the future of mankind, with technology becoming ever cheaper, more powerful, and more pervasive. As he expresses it in his chirping way:
<P>
<blockquote>
I've already said I'm an optimist, and I'm optimistic about the impact of the new technology. It will enhance leisure time and enrich culture by expanding the distribution of information. It will help relieve pressures on urban areas by enabling individuals to work from home or remote-site offices. It will relieve pressure on natural resources because increasing numbers of products will be able to take the form of bits rather than of manufactured goods.</blockquote>
<P>
What makes <I>The Road Ahead</I> so surprisingly useful is that it seems to be a fair, even-handed, and sober appraisal of the situation and very clearly explains complicated ideas to laymen like myself. The author simply lays out one concept after another -- the Internet, the information super-highway, high-definition television, and fiber optics -- with the result that those of us who are not techies finally understand all the terms that have been buzzing around in our heads for the past five years.
<P>
Naturally the information revolution is not without its dissenters. Few are as dourly pessimistic as Mark Slouka in <I>War of the Worlds</I>. This book seems to me to overreach somewhat by buying into the whole virtual-reality racket -- which I predict will remain decidedly ancillary to the information revolution  -- and by supposing that this and other developments will spell the end of reality as we know it. As for the Internet itself, it ``combines the worst of television -- its addictiveness, its passivity -- with the worst of on-line communication -- its self-conscious glorification of superfice [<I>sic</I>], its pop-culture chattiness, its pointless immediacy.''
<P>
Mark Dery's <I>Escape Velocity</I> in one sense goes even further. Dery seems at once to mock and to believe recent ``post-human'' speculations that advocate or predict a literal, physical merging of man and machine into a digitized, dehumanized whole. His book is a highly detailed discussion of cyberculture: that is, those new forms of art, literature, music, and attitude that have arisen at the corners of the information revolution. In his pages we encounter all the technopagans, virtual anarchists, cyber-novelists, performance artists, and cult film-makers for whom the information revolution is a virtual Bohemia joined in cyberspace to an equally virtual, if dystopian, Wild West.
<P>
<font size=+3>T</font><font size=+1>HE</font> fixation on the future that all these books exhibit to a remarkable degree has been a fixture of Western discourse for the last two hundred years: starting with Restif de la Bretonne, and extending through Jules Verne, H. G. Wells, Arthur C. Clarke, and William Gibson. The problem with books that seek, as these do, to discuss the future is that the future really is an undiscovered country from which imaginary travelers come back bearing more outlandish tales than Sir John Mandeville with his one-eyed anthropophagi. And because anyone's guess is as good as anyone else's, there seems to be an overwhelming impulse to exaggerate in the most shameless fashion imaginable, since it is the <I>deformation professionnelle</I> of all writers to want at all costs to have something to say.
<P>
And yet futurologists, even when they are more circumspect in their predictions, always make the same fundamental mistake, whether they view the future as a light-filled, pyramid-powered Eden or as a cybernetic Hell. Indeed, it is precisely the same mistake that many historians make when writing about the remoter past. And this mistake, it seems to me, is to suppose that to change the material circumstances of life is to alter fundamentally the sense of life itself. But life as it is lived is always pretty much the same, with the same protocols of boredom and excitement, the same glare of midday and gloom of eventide, the same petty ambitions, existential doubts, and immortal longings. We can certainly create the circumstances of greater freedom or greater oppression, but the range of possible variation in life itself, in the simple, irreducible sense of being alive, is far narrower than our chattering classes usually appreciate.
<P>
At the same time, it would be foolhardy and unfair to reason from this that change never happens. We have undergone great changes in this century; and though the Internet is still in its earliest infancy, it promises to grow up quickly. From a purely technological perspective, many users of the Internet already have far more efficient modems than I have. And through Moore's Law, which states that every 18 months computers double in power as their prices drop by half, we can expect that we all shall soon be getting better Internet service for less money, which means that fewer users will feel the need to punch their laptops.
<P>
Earlier in my life, as a callow adolescent, I was so disenchanted with the paltriness of industrial civilization -- this was in the late Seventies -- that I almost felt, foolish as it sounds, that I'd like to repeal the modern age entirely. As each day passes, however, I find myself strengthened in the hope that, with the arrival at long last of the information revolution, human society will become more enlightened, more various, more efficient, cleaner, less expensive, freer, and more fun than it has ever been before. One feels privileged to be alive and conscious at this moment in history and can hardly wait to see what humankind will come up with next.

<H2>Mr. Dole's Fate.</H2>
</center> 
<P>
<center>By John O'Sullivan</center>
<P>
<center><I>Mr. O'Sullivan is the editor of</I> National Review.</center>
<P>
<center>
<B><I>This article originally appeared in the London</I> New Statesman, <I>August 9, 1996</I></B></center> 
<P>
If one had to predict the eventual verdict on the Republicans gathering in Convention at San Diego next week, it would be suicide by timidity. The GOPa conservative party in a conservative country at a conservative historical momentis facing a major defeat in November at the hands of the most distrusted President since Richard Nixon. It has reached these straits not by embracing a Pat Buchanan or a radical right agenda but by allowing the party establishment to impose a decent but ideologically flavorless moderate, apparently out-of-touch with both party and country, as its standard-bearer. And it proposes to celebrate this event, fittingly enough, by staging a Convention from which all debate, controversy and indeed politics will have been ruthlessly expunged to make room for short pep-talks, video cartoons, advertising films, and cameo appearances by political celebrities (who are, by definition, not very celebrated).
<P>
The manufactured enthusiasm in the hall, however, will be balanced by the sincere defeatism outside it. Even Republican politicians and pundits sympathetic to the GOP believe that Dole is as good as defeated already. The only question to be decided is whether he will take the Republicans in House and Senate down with him. Some even speculate that the Republican party itself is heading for a post-election crack-up in which economic conservatives ("moderates" in NewClassSpeak) will finally split from the Religious Right. After which, in the approved media version, Buchananite "America Firsters," Perotistas, supply-siders, right-to-lifers, and all the other inmates of the Right Zoo will battle endlessly to succeed the GOP , allowing liberal Democrats to regain their rightful place as the government of the country. Liberaldom, in ruins only last year, will have been restored.
<P>
If this vision seems at all plausible, it is a sour tribute to the extent of the GOP's collapse since 1994. The problem is generally assumed to be Dole the campaigner. Michael Kelly of the New Yorker brilliantly pinned him down as a "nega-candidate" who campaigns in an almost post-modern style, reciting his texts as instructed by consultants but then subverting their message with ironic ad-libs. Of his own campaign slogan, he remarked vaguely (and inaccurately) in one interview: "A Better Plan, a man for a better Americawhatever that slogan is they're working on." But Mr. Kelly points out what others have missed: there is something attractive about this unwillingness to play by the rules of a stage-managed media game. Such an assertion of integrity, subtle but unmistakable, against the cynical tactics of modern campaigning (which Clinton has embraced in the person of super-consultant Dick Morris), might even be the only way Mr. Dole could win in November.
<P>
What is killing him is his carefully-thought-out and well-executed political strategy. He has been following Richard Nixon's advice that the way to win the White House is by veering rightwards in the primaries and centerwards in the general election. This leftright analysis was always better-suited to Europe than America, but it made some sense when Big Labor confronted Big Capital across a fledgling middle class, when most Americans lived either in cities or in rural areas, when lunch-pail issues dominated both people's lives and political debate, and when there were no culture wars or fears of Balkanization because almost everyone agreed on the virtues and opportunities that together constitute the American dream. It has been rendered virtually useless by the growth of suburban America (now home to half the electorate), the rise of the Sunbelt (51 per cent of the electoral college vote), the continuing decline of labor unions (representing only 15 per cent of the workforce), the growing importance of small business, entrepreneurship and highly skilled labor (over 60 per cent of the workforce is now classified as professional or white-collar), the emergence of single-issue politics from feminism to abortion (which has helped drive blue-collar Democrats into the GOP), the demographic transformation of America by immigration from a bi-racial nation to a multi-ethnic one (in which non-Hispanic whites are projected to be a minority by 2051), and the social fragmentation and cultural anxieties these trends have fostered. 
<P>
Where once two great political blocs fought over the small strip of middle ground separating them, today political parties have to assemble a majority anew in each election from among a scattering of regional, ethnic and social groups. Psephologist Patrick Reddy has identified seven such "tribes": Blacks, new minorities (Asians and Hispanics), white liberals, working-class or populist whites, Northern rural voters, suburbanites, and conservatives. The first three groups are in the Democrats' pocket; the last three lean to the GOP; and working-class whites in recent years have been moving sharply to the Right. But all of these groups need to be won over, or at least energized, by the powerful political appeals every four years. 
<P>
So far Bill Clinton has been wooing them far more effectively than the GOP. He shored up his Democratic base among minorities and liberals by portraying Republican cuts in projected Medicare spending (which he was also proposing, though to a lesser extent) as root-and-branch attacks on social entitlements. He simultaneously made inroads into the suburbanite vote by accepting a balanced budgetwittily balanced by spending cuts that would come into effect after the end of his second term. And he appealed to both suburbanites and populist whites by rhetorical and symbolic conservatism such as his call for school uniforms and teenage curfews. Shameless though they are, such tactics would certainly have blunted a GOP attackif one had been launched.
<P>
But Bob Dole, in addition to diving towards a mythical center, has been almost entirely reactive, concentrating on issues like abortion or problems like the "gender gap" where his party is divided or the Republicans are less trusted . To grasp the effect, imagine that John Major had spent 1992 talking about the NHS and never mentioning taxes. 
<P>
In fact, as Clinton's tactics reveal, new demographics mean new issues. Most Americans (about four and a half of Mr. Reddy's seven tribes) are prosperous and believe that government is too big and too intrusive. They don't want to see middle-class entitlements eradicated, but they look at the budget and sense that they will have to be at least pruned. And anyway, with the combination of federal, state and local taxes at 31.5 per cent of GDPlow by international standards but a peacetime high in the U.S.they feel the tax bite of government more. Here, at least, the Republicans have crafted a positive appeal to their constituencies. Dole's promise of a tax cut earlier this week serves as a proxy for all of these issues. The voters may not believe that as President he would actually cut taxes by $600 billion, but they will take his pledge as a sign that he will not raise them, that he may even cut them by some amount, and that therefore he will be forced to rein government back. 
<P>
The pressing political reality of 1996, however, is that for all the talk about "downsizing" and "economic anxiety", it is the issues of moral decline, social disorder and ethnic separatism that people are really worried about. As Michael Barone pointed out in <I>The American Enterprise</I>: "Violent crime is a greater threat to most Americans than short-term unemployment. Divorce is a far greater threat than job loss to the typical person's lifetime project of accumulating wealth . . ." Immigration, racial quotas, and multiculturalism arouse similar fears, and they have the added annoyance that, unlike crime, they are the deliberate effects of government policy. But the language in which people would once have expressed such anxieties has been discredited as "racist" or "nativist" and so they complain about them in the code of "economic anxiety."
<P>
Clinton, who allegedly blames his 1980 gubernatorial defeat on voter anger at the Mariel boatlift of Cuban immigrants, has been quick to sense the importance of these issues. His symbolic conservative gestures, the administration's theatrical "crackdown" on illegal border crossing, and the crime bill, itself largely symbolic, have defused some of them. But his signing of the welfare reform bill was as far as he could go in this direction without enraging his political base among liberals, blacks, and new minorities. Dole's obvious tactic therefore is emphasize those issues where the President simply cannot endorse conservative policies. A random sample might include: restricting the powers of the federal judiciary; extending school choice, via vouchers, to parochial schools; ending race and gender preferences; seriously enforcing laws against illegal immigration but also reducing legal immigration; supporting English as the official language and, more generally, opposing the wen of multiculturalism; and in general defending the concept of an inclusive "American" identity against the second coming of hyphenation. 
<P>
Most of these issues fall into neither of the two approved conservative categories: the "social conservatism" of the religious right and the libertarianism of the economic right. But what might best be called "cultural conservatism" gets support varying from 65 to 80 per cent in opinion polls. It arouses all three of the GOP tribes, plus the swing vote of populist whites, <I>and</I> Black Americans who face competition in the labor market from low-paid immigrants. In particular, it appeals to natural Republicans disaffected from the post-Reagan GOPsecularized Protestants, Northern WASPs, environmentalists, the Planned Parenthood crowd, and above all supporters of the Reform Party. A good example is Ross Perot's challenger, former Governor Dick Lamm, who is the author of tract entitled "The Immigration Time Bomb."
<P>
The GOP has dabbled in these waters with extreme nervousness. What restrains it is mainly that its post-civil-rights leadership is afraid of being seen as "racist" or "nativist" and "on the wrong side of history." This nervousness is rational. <I>The New York Times</I>, which noted in a single detached comment on a Democratic political ad that it was "unusual" for Democrats to use "inflammatory negative images of illegal immigrants," would still be shrieking "Willie Horton" if the GOP had done anything similar. There is also an ideological element in Republican reluctance. Leading Republicans like Jack Kemp and House Leader Dick Armey are uncomfortable with non-economic "hot button" issues like quotas, and intellectually committed to the view that immigration is an unqualified economic benefit. But they are resisting the majority of their party here. And it is a fair bet that, in any post-election struggle but especially one after a Dole defeat, the Republicans will move to add cultural conservatism to the religious and economic varieties. The signs are already there in Republican fund-raising letters which highlight quotas and immigration. 
<P>
But that will be too late for Mr. Dole. If he remains committed to a campaign of blandness and Nixon's advice, he will repeat his recent experience with two issues which have eighty per cent popular backing in virtually every poll but until recently a low political salience: increasing the minimum wage and making English the official language. Dole doubtless believed, following the conventional media wisdom, that the first is centrist, and the second "right," even "extreme." At any rate, hardly anything has been heard from him on official English since the primaries (indeed, he has been visibly edging away from the similar issue of racial and gender quotas). But he did not take long to move to the center to endorse a higher minimum wage once the Democrats had raised the issue. The net effect was to deny himself a popular issue with a powerful appeal both to his natural constituencies and to working-class whites, while helping to concentrate people's attention on the minimum wage where the Democrats enjoy a natural advantage with the public.
<P>
And this on the say-so of the late Richard Nixon. It is hard to believe that the Nixon of 1968, who crafted the new Republican majority with the southern strategy and appeals to law 'n' order, would have followed his own advice so blindly. 
<P>

<b>Sample Resolution for Closing the Emerging 
Gap Between U.S. Military Forces and Overseas Security Commitments
<p>
H. Con. Res. 1</b>
</center><p>
Expressing the sense of Congress concerning the overseas security commitments and the national security of the United States.
<p><center><b>
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
May 15, 1996</b></center>
<p>
Mr. X submitted the following concurrent resolution, which was referred to the Committee on National Security
<p><hr><p>
<center><b>CONCURRENT RESOLUTION</b></center>
<p>
Expressing the sense of Congress concerning the overseas security commitments and national security of the United States.
<p>
Whereas the United States currently maintains a wide variety of security commitments to its friends and allies around the world, including countries in Asia, Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East;
<p>
Whereas the Clinton Administration in 1993 proposed in its "Bottom-Up Review" of defense policy to uphold the existing security commitments of the United States by fielding conventional military forces capable of fighting and winning two major regional conflicts, each roughly similar in size and scope to the Persian Gulf War, "nearly simultaneously;"
<p>
Whereas the Bottom-Up Review recommends the retention of ten active divisions in the Army, twenty tactical fighter wings in the Air Force, 11 active aircraft carriers in the Navy, and 174,000 active duty troops in the Marine Corps;
<p>
Whereas the Bottom-Up Review recommends the retention of a military manpower endstrength of 2,366,000 positions in the active and reserve components combined;
<p>
Whereas four retired military officers reported to Senator John McCain in February 1995, that the conventional forces recommended by the Bottom-Up Review, even if fully funded, are not capable of meeting the assigned mission of addressing two major regional conflicts in short succession;
<p>
Whereas there is widespread agreement among defense analysts outside the Clinton Administration, including those with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, the Congressional Budget Office, the Defense Budget Project (now the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments), the General Accounting Office, and The Heritage Foundation, that the Clinton Administration's defense budget is too small to pay for the force recommended by the Bottom-Up Review;
<p>
Whereas the Clinton Administration's six-year (fiscal years 1997-2002) defense funding shortfall relative to the force recommended by the Bottom-Up Review likely exceeds $100 billion;
<p>
Whereas the Clinton Administration's defense funding shortfall, assuming the needs for readiness and modernization are properly addressed and strategic and nuclear forces are funded at necessary levels, will likely force the reduction of conventional forces to levels of no more than eight active Army divisions, 15 Air Force tactical fighter wings, eight active aircraft carriers, and 140,000 active duty Marine Corps troops;
<p>
Whereas the Clinton Administration's defense funding shortfall is likely to drive the military manpower endstrength down to a level of just over 2,000,000 positions in the active and reserve components combined;
<p>
Whereas seven active divisions from the Army, twenty tactical fighter wings from the Air Force, six aircraft carrier battle groups from the Navy, and 93,000 troops from the Marine Corps either participated in or contributed to the force fielded during the Persian Gulf War;
<p>
Whereas the conventional forces likely resulting from the levels of defense spending proposed by the Clinton Administration during the next six years would make it difficult to field an expeditionary force of the size that fought the Persian Gulf War, much less the two such conflicts envisioned by the Bottom-Up Review; and
<p>
Whereas the 1995 congressional budget resolution (House Concurrent Resolution 67) directs a total level of expenditures for defense for the six-year period covering fiscal years 1997-2002 that is roughly similar to that proposed by the Clinton Administration: Now therefore be it
<p><blockquote>
<I>Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring</I>), That it is the sense of Congress that -- 
<p><blockquote>
(1) the protection of the vital interests of the United States requires that the United States uphold its existing security commitments, including those to friendly and allied countries in Asia, Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East;
<p>
(2) the conventional forces of the United States should be large and strong enough to uphold the existing overseas security commitments of the United States;
<p>
(3) the smaller conventional forces likely resulting from the defense budget proposed by the Clinton Administration will be too small to fulfill the existing overseas security commitments of the United States;
<p>
(4) the existing overseas security commitments of the United States can be met by fielding conventional forces capable of fighting and winning one major regional conflict, roughly the size of the Persian Gulf War, and one minor regional conflict, roughly the size of the 1989 invasion of Panama, simultaneously, as opposed to the two major regional conflicts called for by the Bottom-Up Review;
<p>
(5) fulfilling the existing overseas security commitments of the United States requires the United States to contribute military forces to peacekeeping missions only when doing so will serve to protect the vital interests of the United States;
<p>
(6) fulfilling the existing overseas security commitments of the United States can be met with conventional military forces roughly of the size proposed by the Bottom-Up Review, which include the equivalent of 15 total divisions in the Army (10 active divisions), twenty tactical fighter wings in the Air Force, 11 aircraft carrier battle groups (active) in the Navy; and 174,000 active duty troops in the Marine Corps, provided these forces are both combat ready and fully modernized;
<p>
(7) fulfilling the existing overseas security commitments of the United States can be achieved with a total military manpower endstrength similar to that proposed by the Bottom-Up Review, some 2,366,000 positions in the active and reserve components combined;
<p>
(8)  Congress should provide the funds required for the forces recommended by this resolution, even though they will likely be substantially more than what the Clinton Administration has budgeted for defense over the next six years. </blockquote></blockquote>

ADOPTION PLANS?</h2>

<p>

A glaring discrepancy exists between what Americans believe and
how they behave regarding adoption as a positive response to crisis
pregnancies. Consider the following data:

<p>

<li>Many Americans believe that adoption is the best response
to an out-of-wedlock pregnancy. A 1995 Family Research Council
survey of 1,000 Americans found that, when presented with four
options to resolve out-of-wedlock teenage pregnancies, 29 percent
of respondents thought it best to &quot;have the child and put
it up for adoption;&quot; 24 percent thought it best for the mother
&quot;to marry the child's father and have the child;&quot; 11
percent thought it best for the mother &quot;to have the child
and raise it by herself;&quot; and only 8 percent thought it best
for her to have an abortion.[1]

<p>

However, in reality, 46 percent of all the nonmarital pregnancies
in 1991 ended in induced abortion, 10 percent ended in miscarriage,
and 44 percent were carried to term, of which only 2 percent were
placed for adoption.[2] (It is not known whether the mother eventually
married the child's father or chose to raise the child by herself
in the remaining 98 percent of &quot;live birth&quot; cases.)

<p>

<li>Many young, unmarried pregnant women also hold favorable attitudes
toward those who choose adoption. A survey of such women staying
in maternity homes found that the majority, regardless of whether
they were choosing adoption or single parenthood, hold positive
attitudes toward mothers who place their children for adoption.
The respondents believe that a woman who places her baby for adoption
loves the baby, wants the best for the baby, is being a good parent
in a special way, is being responsible, and is neither selfish
nor abandoning the baby.[3] Nevertheless, many of these same unmarried
pregnant women had never considered adoption as an option for
their children.

<p>

Why do so few unmarried women choose adoption in reality when
both they and the general American public hold favorable attitudes
toward adoption? Also, what accounts for the decline of adoptions 
over time? Before 1973, about one in five non-marital births to white 
women was placed for adoption. By the late 1970s, this proportion had 
shrunk to less than one in 10, and by the late 1980s, to one in 30.[4]

<p>

The answer may lie less in the fact that public opinion towards
adoption has changed than in the fact that other options have
overshadowed adoption, making adoption less visible as an alternative.

<p>

The impact of three major social trends during the last two to
three decades may provide some clues to this phenomenon:

<p>

(1) <b>Increasing Social Acceptance of Single Parenthood</b> --
The sheer prevalence of single-parent families has increased the
social acceptability of single motherhood. For example, in 1970,
13 percent of all families with children were single-parent families.
By 1994, more than 30 percent of all families with children were
headed by a single parent.[5]

<p>

The trend towards single parenthood began with the liberalizing
of divorce laws in the late 1960s and early 1970s and the subsequent
divorce epidemic. Indeed, the number of divorces per year tripled
between 1960 and 1990.[6] But when divorce began to level off in
the 1980s, the growth in illegitimacy continued the trend. In
1970, 11 percent of all births were to unmarried women; in 1980,
18 percent of all births were nonmarital; and by 1991, an astounding
30 percent of all births were out-of-wedlock.[7] Yet, even more significant
than the rise in nonmarital births is the even faster growth in
the <I>visibility</I> of illegitimacy. Adoption helps to mask
the visibility of illegitimacy because the child born out-of-wedlock
is immediately placed in a two-parent home. However, the proportion
of unmarried women choosing adoption dramatically declined during
the same time period that illegitimacy rates rose.

<p>

It is this high visibility of single-parent families that has
made single parenting normative in today's society. Thus, there
is more precedent for young unmarried women to choose single parenthood
and comparatively less incentive for them to place their children
in adoptive homes.

<p>

(2) <b>The Legalization of Abortion</b> -- The introduction of
abortion has greatly diminished the likelihood of choosing adoption
because it has altered the thought processes by which both the
pregnant woman and her counselors approach an unintended pregnancy.

<p>

Before abortion was legalized, women facing a crisis pregnancy
had only to decide among three or four options: adoption, marrying
the father, raising the child herself and/or having her parent
raise the child. Among these options, adoption fared relatively
well as one in five white women chose adoption.

<p>

However, after abortion was legalized, a two-tiered thought process
replaced the previously one-tiered process. The preeminent question
was no longer &quot;Who shall raise this child?&quot; but rather,
&quot;Shall I have this child?&quot; And with that change in question
also came a change in focus from being child-centered to woman-centered.
Thus, it is not surprising that fewer women are choosing adoption
because adoption typically requires a child-centered focus.

<p>

Since the legalization of abortion, pregnancy counselors must
also spend much more time and effort addressing the first question
of &quot;Shall this pregnancy be carried to term or aborted?&quot;
And while this must be the first question addressed, too often
counselors give short shrift to the second question of &quot;Who
shall raise this child?&quot; One study found that nearly 40 percent
of pregnancy counselors failed to include adoption as an option
in their counseling. Even worse, the counselors had a 40 percent
rate of uncertainty and inaccurate knowledge about adoption. Some
even failed to present adoption as an option because they thought
the girls would not want to hear about it.[8]

<p>

(3) <b>Increasing Availability and Use of Welfare Benefits</b>
-- To the degree financial considerations play a role in whether
a woman chooses to marry, place for adoption, or raise the child
herself, the increasing availability and use of welfare benefits
add weight to the single-parenting option. Beginning in the late
1960s, Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and Medicaid
benefits for pregnant, single mothers became well-established
and well-used. Both AFDC and Medicaid have grown tremendously
over the last two decades as more and more unwed mothers have
chosen single parenthood. Knowing that they have this &quot;safety
net&quot; on which to fall back, many unmarried women choose to
raise their infants rather than make adoption plans.

<p>

In conclusion, despite the fact that most Americans favorably
view adoption, several major social trends have altered the course
of the discussion and made the adoption option less visible. However,
there is a growing counter-movement to change the terms of discourse
once again and combat the social trends that lead not only to
fewer adoptions, but also to greater numbers of out-of-wedlock
births, abortions, and welfare recipients. During the mid-1980s,
a &quot;new wave&quot; of adoption and maternity services agencies
began opening up in the United States. These include more private
adoption agencies, pro-life crisis pregnancy centers, maternity
homes, and private charitable organizations. The degree to which
these institutions grow more visible and flourish is the degree
to which adoption can grow, narrowing the gap between public opinion
and reality.

<title>MILITARY HOMOSEXUAL CASES RACE TO THE SUPREME COURT</title>

<body>

<p>

<h2>MILITARY HOMOSEXUAL CASES<br>
RACE TO THE SUPREME COURT</h2>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

<i>by</i>

<p>

<i>Lieutenant Colonel Robert L. Maginnis (U.S.A., Ret.)</i></center>

<p>

Two military homosexual cases are now competing for a Supreme
Court hearing. Both cases have already been heard at the appellate
court level, and decisions are expected by the summer.

<p>

These cases are complicated by major differences between the congressional
law concerning homosexuality in the armed forces (Defense Authorization
Act of 1994, 10 U.S.C. &#167; 654) and the regulations issued
by the Clinton administration to implement this law (DoD Directive
1332.14 and 1332.30).[1]

<p>

These differences include:

<p><ul>

<li>As passed by Congress, the law forbids service by homosexuals.
The Clinton regulations permit service by &quot;celibate&quot;
homosexuals and drop the principled and unambiguous statement
that &quot;homosexuality is incompatible with military service.&quot;

<p>

<li>The law requires the discharge of people with a propensity
to engage in homosexual conduct. The Clinton regulations redefine
propensity to mean the narrow term &quot;likelihood.&quot;

<p>

The law relies on commander discretion to initiate investigations.
The Clinton regulations create a &quot;criminal-like&quot; standard
before investigations can be initiated. According to Secretary
of Defense William Perry, attending gay pride parades, frequenting
gay bars, and possessing gay materials are not &quot;credible&quot;
evidence to initiate an investigation. In addition, the Clinton
regulations hinder military criminal investigators from investigating
private consensual sexual misconduct (sodomy and adultery).

<p>

<li>The law forbids homosexual service for readiness reasons.
But contrary to 200 years of military practice, Clinton's Defense
Department no longer considers homosexual behavior a marker for
increased security risk. Information discovered during a security
investigation cannot be used for adverse action without permission
from high-level political appointees.

</ul><p>

<center><h3><i>ABEL ET AL. V. U.S.A.</i></h3></center>

<p>

The Family Research Council filed a friend-of-the-court brief
in the first federal challenge to the military's homosexual policy.[2]
The case involves six avowed homosexuals who allege that the military's
policy violates their First and Fifth Amendment rights.

<p>

This case was filed in 1994 shortly after the congressional law
took effect. The plaintiffs skirted the military's normal administrative
process and went straight to federal court seeking a preliminary
injunction (PI) barring the military from discharging them until
their constitutional challenge was resolved. The government sought
relief from the PI via the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2d Circuit,
and was granted that motion, forcing the lower court to hurry
up the hearing.

<p>

In March, 1995, <I>Abel et al. v. U.S.A.</I> was heard by Judge
Eugene Nickerson of the Eastern District of New York. Lambda Legal
Defense and Education Fund and the American Civil Liberties Union
represented the homosexual service members. They called six 
&quot;expert&quot; witnesses to refute the military's claim of a 
constitutional right to exclude homosexuals. Curiously, Clinton Justice 
Department lawyers did not counter any of these witnesses with expert 
testimony from defenders of the ban.

<p>

In addition, the Justice Department failed to:[3]

<p><ul>

<li>Present well-documented arguments for denying homosexual service
based on physical and psychological problems.

<p>

<li>Demonstrate that the policy is conduct-based rather than status-based
as the plaintiffs argued.

<p>

<li>Show that homosexual &quot;lifestyles&quot; and &quot;values&quot;
are contrary to the best interests of the armed services and present
serious morale and unit cohesion problems.

<p>

<li>Refute a flawed study cited by the plaintiffs as evidence
that homosexuals will not damage morale and unit cohesion.

<p>

<li>Demonstrate that homosexuals present a risk to the military.

</ul><p>

The plaintiffs complain that the government violated their First
Amendment rights when it tried to discharge them based on their
homosexuality. The government argued that this is not a First
Amendment issue because the law and the policy are directed solely
at the prohibition of acts and give members the opportunity to
rebut the presumption of misconduct. However, the government failed
to show a nexus between a declaration of homosexuality and homosexual
misconduct. In fact, government lawyers labeled much of the available
evidence as &quot;myths,&quot; thus aiding the plaintiffs.

<p>

The government argued that heterosexual service members &quot;will
be upset by a co-worker's mere statement of homosexuality&quot;
and as a result refuse to work cooperatively. Judge Nickerson
found for the plaintiffs.[4] He labeled the discrimination unjustified
and noted key differences between the congressional law and the
Clinton policy:

<p><ul>

<li>Although the law permits asking about homosexual acts and
orientation at the point of admission, the Clinton administration
has rejected such questions. The judge labeled this as unusual.
On one hand the Pentagon encourages homosexuals to join (by not
making homosexuality part of a pre-induction litmus test) and
then insists that the homosexual remain secretive about his 
&quot;status.&quot;

<p>

<li>The law denies service to homosexuals, but the policy permits
service to admitted homosexuals who can rebut the presumption
that they will engage in homosexual misconduct. This creates a
status/conduct dichotomy. The judge labels the rebuttable presumption
as &quot;Orwellian&quot; because the government failed to show
a connection between a declaration of homosexuality and misconduct.
The judge understandably concluded &quot;that the admission of
homosexuals did not pose an uncontrollable risk that they would
commit acts inherently dangerous to morale, good order, and 
discipline....&quot;

</ul><p>

Nickerson explained that his task &quot;is to determine the constitutionality
of the policy [read law] adopted by Congress, not its morality.&quot;
He argues that everyone is &quot;entitled to think it demeaning
and unworthy of a great nation to base a policy [read law] on
pretense rather than on truth.&quot;

<p>

Nickerson's decision was appealed by the government to the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Manhattan. The hearing
was set for December 19 but was postponed due to unusual circumstances.

<p>

The night before the hearing, a letter was faxed to one of the
judges from the Justice Department. It reminded Judge Guido Calabresi
that back in March 1993 he had signed a letter to Congress maintaining
that legislation banning homosexuals from the military was unconstitutional.
At the time he co-signed the letter with 118 other lawyers, Judge
Calabresi was the dean of the Yale Law School. He was appointed
by President Clinton to the federal bench in 1994.

<p>

Calabresi's letter says, &quot;The ban on military service by
lesbian, gay and bisexual Americans violates the most basic premise
of equal protection law: that all similarly situated persons should
be treated alike.&quot;[5]

<p>

The judge recused himself from the case the morning of the scheduled
hearing. The case was rescheduled with a new panel and heard on
January 16, 1996.

<p>

At that hearing, Chief Judge John M. Walker Jr., a Bush appointee,
demonstrated an understanding of the law's intent. &quot;If you
say you're a homosexual,&quot; Walker said, &quot;in order to
rebut the presumption, you can't be a homosexual. A person is
either joking, mistaken, lying or expressing vague desires, as
opposed to propensity.&quot;[6]

<p>

Deputy Solicitor General Kneedler urged the court to &quot;rely
on the policy,&quot; which rationally allows a superior to address
an issue. He noted that the policy works and explained that seven
avowed homosexuals have already rebutted the presumption of conduct
and have been allowed to continue serving. Finally, he recommended
overturning the lower court's decision because the homosexual
members failed to exhaust administrative challenges before taking
their case to court.[7]

<p>

Matthew A. Coles, of the American Civil Liberties Union, argued
that the military has no right to ban either homosexual acts or
their speech. He also challenged the reasoning behind the idea
that homosexuals should have to rebut the presumption that they
will engage in homosexual acts.[8]

<p>

Judge Pierre Leval asked Coles to respond to a parallel situation.
Leval posed the question, what would the military do if someone
declared himself a white supremacist? Coles said the military
would do nothing. But the judge argued that at least the military
would investigate to determine whether the individual intended
to act on his beliefs.[9]

<p>

<center><h3><i>THOMASSON V. PERRY</i></h3></center>

<p>

FRC had the rare privilege to make oral arguments before the Fourth
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va., in the case of
<I>Thomasson v. Perry</I>.[10] Lt. Paul G. Thomasson is an avowed
homosexual who petitioned the court to declare the military's
ban unconstitutional. FRC defended the law while the Justice Department
hid behind the Clinton administration's faulty policy.

<p>

This case has followed an unusual track. It began on March 2,
1994, the day Thomasson wrote a letter to his boss at the Bureau
of Naval Personnel in Arlington, Virginia. The letter contained
the declaration, &quot;I am gay.&quot; A Navy administrative board
discharged him June 15,1994 for homosexuality. Thomasson never
admitted to homosexual conduct and failed to rebut the presumption
of misconduct.[11]

<p>

He subsequently filed a motion for relief with the U.S. Federal
Court for the Eastern District of New York asking the court to
declare the military's policy unconstitutional. U.S. District
Judge Claude M. Hilton ruled that the policy was constitutional
upholding Thomasson's honorable discharge. Thomasson's appeal
of that decision was then heard by a three-judge panel from the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Alexandria, Virginia.[12]

<p>

On September 12, 1995, at the appeals court hearing, one of the
judges said the Clinton administration has a &quot;problem&quot;
in defending its &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot; policy on homosexuals.
It does not match the intent of Congress.[13]

<p>

Judge J. Michael Luttig told Deputy Solicitor General Edwin Kneedler,
who argued that the Clinton policy is constitutional, &quot;I
think you've got a problem in the government's case.&quot; He
accused the administration of using the policy to make an &quot;end
run&quot; around the Congress.[14]

<p>

All three judges roundly criticized the policy scheme, in particular
the attempted distinction between &quot;orientation&quot; and
&quot;propensity.&quot;[15]

<p>

Allan Moore, Lt. Thomasson's attorney, told the court that the
policy and law violate the constitution's guarantees of free speech
and equal protection. Moore labeled the policy &quot;an Orwellian
concept.&quot; He rejects the notion that the statement, &quot;I
am gay,&quot; presumes misconduct. He argued that the statement
is nothing more than an admission of identity or status.[16]

<p>

Judge Luttig posed a hypothetical case to Mr. Kneedler. What if
I claim to be a communist? Can I rebut the government's presumption
that I will engage in communist activities? The judge then skipped
to the homosexual case. &quot;Okay to think, 'I'm gay,' but can't
say so. But if I say it, I must persuade the decision-maker that
I won't do gay things.&quot; The relationship between &quot;status&quot;
and &quot;propensity&quot; consumed most of the oral argument.[17]

<p>

After the hearing, the three judges signed an order saying they
wanted the full court to rehear the case. At this point, FRC filed
a motion to make oral arguments and, in an unusual move, the court
granted that motion.[18]

<p>

On December 5, the 13 judges of the U.S. Appeals Court for the
Fourth Circuit reheard the case in Richmond, Va. Once again, Judge
Luttig took a conservative stance. He said, &quot;It seems to
me...the Navy is concerned with conduct and not speech.&quot;
Judge Paul V. Niemeyer joined in, &quot;I'm just wondering why
this is a speech case at all.&quot;[19]

<p>

Judge Harvie Wilkinson III said, &quot;Don't we have here a case
where statements are used for evidentiary value, and the First
Amendment never prohibits statements for whatever evidentiary
value they may have?&quot;[20]

<p>

Professor William Woodruff, the Army's former chief of litigation
and now a law professor at Campbell University in North Carolina,
argued for FRC. He explained that the Clinton regulations are
inconsistent with the law. He also pointed out that the old policy
was codified in the new law and declared that the intent of the
law was a classwide bar, that is, homosexuals cannot legally serve.
He called for a faithful execution of the law.

<p>

A decision favorable to conservatives is expected by late spring.
That decision will be in competition with <i>Abel</i> for an appeal to
the Supreme Court this summer.

<p>

<center><h3>RELATED ISSUES</h3></center>

<p>

Other homosexual cases are winding their way through the federal
court system. However, either <I>Thomasson</I> or <I>Abel</I>
will most likely be heard by the high court. That decision will
become a landmark for future homosexual litigation such as the
rising tide of homosexual marriage and adoption cases.

<p>

Meanwhile, in August, 1995, Defense Department general counsel
Judith Miller wrote a memo to the military services which spells
out what to do with those service members who say they are homosexual
and what they must do to remain on active duty.[21] This memo followed
the publicized case of Navy Lieutenant Commander Maria Z. Dunning,
who successfully rebutted the presumption by promising not to
engage in homosexual misconduct.[22]

<p>

The memo gave confused commanders better guidance on proceeding
through the homosexual policy thicket. In spite of the latest
clarification, the number of homosexual discharges are up. From
October 1994 to September 1995, the military services discharged
722 members for homosexuality, a 21 percent increase from the
1994 figure of 597 discharges.[23]

<p>

<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>

<p>

No matter which case or combination of cases reaches the Supreme
Court, FRC will file a friend-of-the-court brief and a motion
to make oral argument before the justices. Given past history,
it's reasonable to expect the Clinton Justice Department to under-argue
the case that goes to the high court and, hopefully, FRC's clear
voice defending the law will be heard.

FUTURE YOUTH CRIME<br>
PREDICTED</h2>

<p>

Violent crime was down 5 percent in the first half of 1995 and
murder dropped 12 percent. This was the largest drop in the murder
rate in years and six times larger than the drop the year prior.[1]

<p>

Some experts attribute the decline to a combination of the aging
of baby boomers, police anti-drug gang efforts and the stabilization
of drug-related turf battles. Alfred Blumstein, a professor at
Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh, observes, &quot;In large
cities, the [drug] markets are most mature. Drug markets started
later in smaller cities, later still in rural areas.&quot;[2] Drug-related
violence may now be shifting to suburbia.

<p>

Thus, Rep. Bill McCollum (R-Fla.), Chairman of the House Judiciary
Subcommittee on Crime, worries that these latest crime statistics
&quot;will give us a false sense of security.&quot;[3] He's not alone.

<p>

Kansas City Mayor Emanuel Cleaver said, &quot;We...have absolutely
no idea why we are experiencing such a precipitous drop [in the
murder rate].&quot;[4] There were 26 percent fewer murders in the
first half of 1995 than the same period the prior year. New York
City's crime rate registered its steepest drop in 23 years.[5]

<p>

Amidst the good news, FBI Director Louis Freeh notes that violent
crime involving young people, both as perpetrators and victims,
is on the rise. &quot;The number of juveniles arrested for weapons
offenses has more than doubled over the past decade,&quot; Freeh
said.[6]

<p>

On a typical day in 1994, nine teenagers in the U.S. were murdered
and 13 teenagers committed a murder.[7] A profile of Justice Department
murder arrest rates by age provides a sobering story. In 1965,
23-year-olds were arrested more often for murder than any other
age group, and their rate was 33 per 100,000 23-year-olds. In
1992, 18-year-olds were arrested more often for murder and their
rate was 97 per 100,000 18-year-olds. That's a 467 percent increase
in murder arrests for 18-year-olds.[8] The trend is toward younger
offenders and higher arrest rates.

<p>

In addition, many experts believe that within the next decade
America will experience an unprecedented surge in youth crime.[9]
According to Attorney General Janet Reno, the problem of children
killing will only worsen because demographics show the key at-risk
population -- 14- to 17-year-olds -- will increase significantly
in years to come.[10]

<p>

<center><h3>WHAT CONTRIBUTES TO THE UPSURGE IN THE NUMBER OF 
YOUNG MURDERERS?</h3></center>

<p>

Social scientists cannot show cause-and-effect relationships for
murder. But they can demonstrate that certain conditions highly
correlate with the increase in juvenile violence.

<p>

<li><b>Parental absence increases a child's likelihood of future
criminal behavior.</b>

<p>

As out-of-wedlock birth has risen, so has the crime rate. Forty-three
percent of all inmates grew up in a single-parent household. Nearly
a third had parents who abused either alcohol or drugs, and more
than a third had at least one family member who was ever incarcerated.[11]

<p>

Cato Institute Chairman William Niskanen said, &quot;A one-percentage-point
increase in births to single mothers appears to increase the violent
crime rate about 1.7 percent.&quot;[12] And a 1990 study by June O'Neill,
a professor with Baruch College of the City University of New
York, shows that men from single-parent families are twice as
likely to commit crimes compared to men from two-parent families.[13]

<p>

Robert Sampson, professor of sociology at the University of Chicago,
notes that it is harder for single-parent families to achieve
the &quot;informal social controls&quot; that limit both crime
and victimization within a community. &quot;There are higher crime
rates in places where communities are not characterized by strong
families,&quot; Sampson said. &quot;The research has been fairly
consistent showing a small-to-moderate positive relationship between
individual delinquency and family breakdown.&quot;[14]

<p>

Even children from two-parent homes suffer when both parents are
absent most of the day due to outside jobs. About 31 million children
under age 15 live with 19 million mothers employed outside the
home. Mothers who work full-time outside the home are four times
more likely to have unsupervised (latchkey) children than moms
who work part-time.[15] This is important, according to a Justice
Department study. It concluded that parental supervision, attachment
to family, and consistency of discipline were the most important
barriers to delinquency and drug abuse.[16]

<p>

Likewise, a study in <I>Child Development</I> found that the fundamental
causes of delinquency are consistent across time and rooted in
generic family processes such as supervision, attachment, and
discipline. This study also found that teenagers whose mothers
who are employed outside the home are more likely to become delinquent
than teenagers whose mothers who are not employed outside the
home. Most adolescents in the low-supervision category (83 percent)
were delinquent compared to 10 percent of those in the high-supervision
category.[17]

<p>

Another study in the <I>Journal of Social Work</I> entitled, &quot;Parenting
in Poverty,&quot; found that for children growing up in very disadvantaged
and violent neighborhoods, the one factor that seems to protect
the child from growing up to be violent is having a parent who
supervises the child very strictly.[18]

<p>

The National Institute of Justice found that being neglected as
a child increases the likelihood of arrest as a juvenile, as an
adult, and for violent crime.[19] This was especially true for juvenile
girls. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,
20 percent of male and female runaways marked parental neglect
as a primary factor for their leaving home.[20]

<p>

Metropolitan Life's 1993 national survey found that teachers (71
percent) and law enforcement officials (90 percent) agree that
the lack of parental supervision at home is a major contributing
factor to violence in schools.[21]

<p>

<li><b>Drug use is highly correlated with delinquent behavior,
and use among adolescents is on the rise.</b>

<p>

A 1994 survey by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) found
that the rate of marijuana use among eighth-graders rose from
6 percent in 1991 to 13 percent in 1994. A similar trend is evident
among 10th- and 12th-graders. Adolescent abuse of cocaine, crack,
heroin, and LSD is also rising.[22]

<p>

Andrew Peyton Thomas, Arizona assistant attorney general and former
NAACP counsel, writes in <I>Crime and the Sacking of America</I>,
&quot;There is...an undeniable relationship between crime and
drugs. Drug addiction can both lower inhibitions among offenders
and spur them on to other crimes to finance their dependency.&quot;
He argues that in spite of the synergism of crime and drugs, analysts
cannot conclude that drugs cause crime. In fact, drugs &quot;do
not ingest themselves.... Drugs reach their human hosts only after
being invited.&quot;[23]

<p>

A Justice Department study of 4,000 urban youths over a five-year
period identified a pattern leading to delinquency.[24] The study
found a direct connection between drug use and delinquency. By
age 16, half of the youth surveyed were using alcohol regularly
and one-quarter were using marijuana.[25]

<p>

The study also found that delinquency starts early. Ten percent
of the 7-year-old boys surveyed reported having committed at least
one street offense. By age 9, the figure was 20 percent and by
17 years of age, 40 percent of the boys had committed at least
one crime.[26]

<p>

<li><b>Most Americans blame the pop culture for increases in youth
violence.</b>

<p>

According to the Family Research Council's 1995 nationwide poll
(conducted by Voter/Consumer Research, a Maryland-based pollster),
more than nine of every 10 Americans believe the media affects
violent crime at least a little.

<p>

Robert McAffee, president of the American Medical Association,
agrees. He said, &quot;If you combine television, motion pictures,
rap music and video games, there's a continuing influence of 
violence....[and] violence is indeed a learned behavior.&quot;[27]

<p>

Senator Bob Dole (R-Kan.) echoed McAffee's view, saying, &quot;Those
who continue to deny that cultural messages can and do bore deep
into the hearts and minds of our young people are deceiving themselves
and ignoring reality.&quot;[28] He called for a boycott of Columbia's
film <I>Money Train</I> following a copycat incident where two
men sprayed flammable liquid through the slot of a Brooklyn subway
token booth, holding a match in the window and seriously burning
the agent inside. The man died several days later.

<p>

But many of Hollywood's elite deny the relationship. Only 30 percent
of media's elite told <I>U.S. News &amp; World Report</I> that
violence in the media contributes to the level of violence in
America.[29] For example, Richard Jewell, a professor in the School
of Cinema-Television at the University of Southern California,
says that Dole's attack is unfair. &quot;The biggest difficulty
with politicians like Dole is that they oversimplify things to
such an extent that we lose sight of the real issues: drugs, families
coming apart, all sort of things that go far beyond media presentation,
Jewell said.&quot;[30]

<p>

But Joel Federman, research director for Mediascope, a Studio
City, Calif.-based public policy group isn't so defensive. He
acknowledges that television violence plays a small but significant
role in promoting more aggressive behavior.[31]

<p>

Robert Butterworth, a Los Angeles-based child psychologist, says
that the average child watches 100,000 acts of television violence
and witnesses 8,000 television murders before the end of elementary
school.[32] This much violence has an effect.[33]

<p>

According to an analysis of 275 studies, George Comstock, the
S.I. Newhouse Professor of Public Communication at Syracuse University,
says that perhaps 10 percent of antisocial and illegal acts can
be linked to television.[34]

<p>

Psychologist Leonard Eron of the University of Michigan's Institute
for Social Research has tracked the television viewing habits
of 650 New York children from 1960 to the present. Those who watched
the most violent programming grew up to be the most aggressive
and crime prone-adults.[35]

<p>

In 1995, the UCLA Center for Communication Policy reviewed numerous
television violence studies. The studies consistently found that
children who view media depictions of aggression became more violent
in their own behavior.[36]

<p>

The National Institute of Mental Health reported that the consensus
in scientific literature is that exposure to television violence
increases children's physical aggressiveness. Senate Judiciary
Committee member Paul Simon (D-Ill.) said he found &quot;nearly
3,000 scholarly articles and studies on the harmful effects of
television violence on children and adults.&quot;[37]

<p>

Murder, which is defined by the FBI as &quot;the willful killing
of one human being by another,&quot; is an aspect of many television
films.[38] Consider these 1995 TV movie titles:

<p>

<I>Death in Small Doses</I> (ABC), <I>Deadline for Murder: From
the Files of Edna Buchanan</I> (CBS), <I>Fatal Vows</I> (CBS),
<I>A Killer Among Friends</I> (CBS), <I>Love Kills: Sweet Justice</I>
(NBC), <I>A Menu for Murder</I> (NBC), <I>The Moment of Truth:
Murder or Memory?</I> (NBC), <I>Marked for Death</I> (CBS), <I>Death
Becomes Her</I> (NBC), <I>The Silence of the Lambs</I> (CBS),
and <I>Falling for You</I> (CBS).

<p>

While television impacts juvenile violence and murder, no one
knows precisely how much. But there are those willing to speculate.
For example, epidemiologist Brandon S. Centerwall told <I>Newsweek</I>
that without television there would be 10,000 fewer murders per
year, 70,000 fewer rapes and 700,000 fewer assaults.[39]

<p>

The music industry shares some of the responsibility. Dr. Joseph
Stuessey, professor of music history at the University of Texas,
told the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee, &quot;Music affects behavior.
This simple fact has been known intuitively for centuries....In
the 20th century, especially in the last four decades, tons of
research has been done on the interrelationship of music and human
behavior....It affects our moods, our attitudes, our emotions,
and our behavior. It affects us psychologically and 
physiologically.&quot;[40]

<p>

Child and adolescent psychiatrist Dr. Robert Demski identifies
music as one of the most powerful influences on youth.[41]

<p>

Dr. Sheila Davis, a professor of lyric writing at New York University,
states that songs &quot;are more than mere mirrors of society;
they are a potent force in the shaping of it....[P]opular songs...provide
the primary 'equipment for living' for America's youth.&quot;[42]

<p>

Pop culture's music is laden with violence. It has themes about
murder, maiming, raping, abusing, and destroying. Rap and heavy
metal are the worst, but others contribute to the promotion of
violence. Some examples of violence-promoting lyrics:

<p><ul>

<li>The Dead Kennedys sing &quot;I Kill Children.&quot; The lyrics
include: &quot;I kill children, I love to see them die. I kill
children to make their mothers cry.&quot;

<p>

<li>Rigor Mortis sings &quot;Bodily Dismemberment.&quot; The lyrics
include: &quot;My fetish is a crime....With five easy slices you're
in six lovely pieces. Bodily dismemberment as passion increases.&quot;

<p>

<li>Blood Feast has a song &quot;Kill for Pleasure&quot; and Motley
Crue has a song &quot;Bastard&quot; about killing someone with
a knife.

</ul><p>

<center><h3>COMING CRIME WAVE</h3></center>

<p>

There are some clear-cut social and demographic trends that make
it very probable that today's shocking stories of youthful violence
will explode over the next decade.

<p>

By the year 2005, the number of teens aged 15 to 19 will increase
by 23 percent and a larger proportion of these teens will be coming
from homes without fathers. Given the correlation between father
absence and crime, some experts estimate that violent crime like
murder could increase to 40,000 killings per year -- that's up
60 percent from the current toll.[43]

<p>

James Q. Wilson, professor of management at the University of
California, Los Angeles and co-editor of the book <I>Crime</I>,
said, &quot;So we should expect, unless something changes dramatically,
that the [now lower] crime rate will go back up.&quot;[44]

<p>

<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>

<p>

Americans perceive that crime is getting worse. This may seem
out of line with recent crime statistics, but the changing face
of crime has made citizens feel less safe. Young thugs are now
the threat, and the danger is likely to increase. Defusing the
coming youth time bomb should be a major priority for all levels
of government.

<title>SOLDIER FALLS ON HIS SWORD TO WAKE UP AMERICA</title>

<h2>SOLDIER FALLS ON HIS SWORD TO<br>
WAKE UP AMERICA</h2>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

<i>by</i>

<p>

<i>Lieutenant Colonel Robert L. Maginnis (U.S. Army, Ret.)</i></center>

<p>

A courageous soldier has become a pawn in a complex national debate
involving the constitutional separation of powers, foreign policy,
and military law. In the end, America must exercise great caution
when deciding these weighty issues.

<p>

Specialist Michael G. New, a former homeschooler and son of Christian
missionaries, refused to wear a blue beret and a United Nations
(U.N.) patch on his U.S. Army uniform because, he believes, it
violates Army uniform regulations and his enlistment oath which
was to &quot;support and defend the Constitution of the United
States,&quot; not the U.N.

<p>

Specialist New's unit, based in Germany, was alerted last summer
for a peacekeeping mission to the former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia (FYROM). His commander ordered a pre-deployment inspection
which included the requirement for all soldiers to appear in formation
wearing their U.S. uniform augmented with a U.N. shoulder patch
and a blue beret. New contends this was an illegal order.

<p>

In August, New told his sergeant that he would disobey an order
to wear the U.N. accouterments on his uniform. After consulting
with his military legal counsel, a chaplain, he flew home from
Germany to discuss his alternatives with his father, his civilian
attorney and congressional representatives. As a result of these
discussions, he decided to disobey the order.

<p>

Specialist New knows that soldiers are expected to obey lawful
orders, and an order to report to duty in a prescribed uniform
is generally a lawful order. However, the government and New disagree
about the Army's authority to prescribe a uniform that includes
the U.N. accouterments.

<p>

In October, after failing to appear in the prescribed uniform,
New was charged with failure to obey an order and offered non-judicial
punishment. Because of his deep conviction on this issue, New
refused non-judicial punishment and asked for a court-martial,
even though this subjected him to potentially much severer punishment
if convicted.

<p>

Specialist New has chosen to fall on his sword to propel onto
the national scene the debate over America's involvement in U.N.-sponsored
peacekeeping missions. This debate ought to be waged by politicians
rather than depending on the martyrdom of an individual soldier.

<p>

<center><h3>THE U.S. MISSION IN MACEDONIA</h3></center>

<p>

Some question the legality of the Macedonian mission. Their concern
centers around the interpretation of the U.N. Charter, which the
U.S. Senate consented to ratify on July 28, 1945 and which was
signed by President Harry Truman on October 31, 1945.

<p>

U.S. Army forces have participated in the ongoing United Nations
Preventive Deployment Force (UNPREDEP) in FYROM as &quot;Task
Force Able Sentry&quot; since July 1993. President Clinton argues
that the Macedonian mission is authorized by Section 2, Clause
1, Article II of the U.S. Constitution which establishes the President
of the United States as the Commander in Chief of the Army and
Navy. In fact, he vetoed the 1996 Defense Authorization Act, in
part, because of his belief that Congress was trying to infringe
upon his authority as Commander in Chief to &quot;assign U.S.
Armed Forces under United Nations operational or tactical 
control.&quot;[1]

<p>

The President has both the constitutional and statutory authority
to employ the armed forces in order to &quot;further U.S. national
interests.&quot; By statute -- Section 7 of the United Nations
Participation Act (22 US Code 287d-1) -- the President may detail
U.S. military personnel to U.N. peacekeeping operations under
Chapter VI of the U.N. Charter to serve as observers, guards,
or in any other noncombatant capacity. Further, under Section
628 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, upon appropriate presidential
determination, U.S. personnel may be assigned or detailed to international
organizations to serve with the international staff of such organizations
or to provide technical, scientific, or professional services
to them.

<p>

The Clinton administration argues that the UNPREDEP was established
as a peacekeeping operation under Chapter VI (Pacific Settlement
of Disputes) of the U.N. Charter, which would mean that the presence
of U.S. troops serving in FYROM is authorized by law. Specialist
New and numerous members of Congress disagree with the administration's
analysis. They contend that this is a Chapter VII (Action with
Respect to Threats to the Peace, Breaches of the Peace, and Acts
of Aggression) mission and is illegal because it was not approved
by Congress.

<p>

On October 6, 1995, 44 members of Congress signed a letter citing
New's case to President Clinton, seeking answers to questions
about America's involvement in U.N. peacekeeping operations. They
asked whether U.S. intervention is in the &quot;national interest,&quot;
if constitutional procedures were respected in the decision to
deploy American troops, and if Americans will be under the command
of foreign officers.[2]

<p>

This politically charged debate illustrates a classic separation
of powers dispute and must be resolved before more Americans are
assigned to U.N. missions.

<p>

<center><h3>THE U.N. IS BECOMING MILITARIZED</h3></center>

<p>

The U.N. has experienced a renaissance with the precipitous fall
of the Soviet Union, rising from near impotence in the early 1980s
to worldwide peacemaker in 1995. This transition has been marked
both by a change in operational philosophy and the expansion of
a blue-helmeted legion of peace-enforcers.

<p>

There is little doubt that the U.N. would not exist today if it
were not for U.S. membership and support. The American taxpayer
has paid a disproportionate part of the U.N. budget. The recent
surge in U.N. military operations should concern American policymakers.

<p>

The U.N. operational philosophy and military role have radically
changed. In the U.N.'s first five years, it launched only two
peacekeeping missions. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, the
U.N. has mounted 19 operations involving more than 70,000 blue-helmeted
soldiers. Last year these operations cost $3.6 billion. Of this,
the U.S. was directly assessed $1.2 billion by the U.N., and the
Clinton administration spent another $1.7 billion for U.S. military
participation in U.N. missions. Today, thousands of American soldiers
wear U.N. blue helmets in 10 countries ranging from Haiti to Lebanon
to the former Yugoslav republics.

<p>

The U.N. has dramatically expanded its use of military forces
in peacekeeping operations. The U.N. Department of Peacekeeping
has expanded from a staff of 23 to more than 350 with a modern
situation center, staffed 24 hours a day, linked electronically
to all U.N. hot spots. It has a standby system to tap troops and
equipment from 185 member nations, and it has established a storage
base in Italy to stockpile equipment such as armored personnel
carriers for rapid deployment to peacekeeping missions.[3]

<p>

The United States Senate has the constitutional authority and
obligation to determine whether continued American membership
in the U.N. serves a useful purpose. A significant question is
whether the militarization of the U.N. is in this country's best
interests.

<p>

<center><h3>CLINTON ADMINISTRATION LIKES THE U.N.</h3></center>

<p>

In 1994, the Clinton administration issued Presidential Decision
Directive 25 on reforming multilateral peacekeeping operations.
This was supposed to make them more selective and more effective.
The directive claims, &quot;The U.S. does not support a standing
U.N. Army, nor will we earmark specific U.S. military units for
participation in U.N. operations.&quot;

<p>

Despite this assurance, White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry
has said that President Clinton supports America's continued U.N.
involvement[4] and Madeleine K. Albright, U.S. Permanent Representative
to the United Nations, told Congress, &quot;The Clinton administration
believes very deeply in the potential of the U.N. system.&quot;[5]

<p>

The Clinton administration has supported the U.N.'s radical transformation,
but some Americans don't share this optimism. Presidential hopeful
Senator Bob Dole (R-Kan.) has said, &quot;It is high time we rein
in U.N. peacekeeping, which is out of control.&quot; Senator Jesse
Helms (R-N.C.) has called the U.N. &quot;the nemesis of millions
of Americans.&quot;[6]

<p>

These are early warning signs that must not be ignored. History
teaches that the acquisition of military power traditionally has
been the first step toward establishing governance over a territory.
Coupling the U.N.'s changing military strength with the new operational
philosophy favoring individual over state sovereignty sends a
warning shot across the bow of free people around the world.

<p>

<center><h3>NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY AT RISK</h3></center>

<p>

Franklin D. Roosevelt envisioned the U.N. dealing with traditional
interstate aggression rather than the types of internal conflict
that now dominate. But the 50-year-old organization is transitioning
to the &quot;new world order.&quot; That change is echoed by U.N.
Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who has issued <I>An
Agenda for Peace</I> suggesting a greatly expanded U.N. peacemaking
role. He endorses the principle of &quot;universal sovereignty&quot;:
&quot;Underlying the rights of the individual and the rights of
peoples is a dimension of universal sovereignty that resides in
all humanity and provides all peoples with legitimate involvement
in issues affecting the world as a whole.&quot;

<p>

Boutros-Ghali has used this concept to sanction U.N. efforts in
Somalia, saying, &quot;The magnitude of the human tragedy constitutes
a threat to international peace and security.&quot; Thus, he justified
the world body's intervention in the sovereign affairs of a nation-state
without invitation. The same happened in Iraq after the Gulf War.

<p>

Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait posed a classic situation for the
U.N. It was a case of aggression in which the armies of one state
crossed international borders to invade another. Desert Shield/Storm
was a successful international effort to reject the invaders and
restore the sovereignty of Kuwait. The subsequent 1991 U.N.-sanctioned
incursion into northern Iraq to protect the Kurds (Operation Provide
Comfort), however, was the first time the Security Council authorized
the use of force in the strictly internal affairs of a member
state. Thus began a potentially dangerous new era for U.N. 
&quot;peacemaking.&quot;

<p>

&quot;Loose constructionists of the U.N. Charter believe the existence
of such problems justifies expanding U.N. jurisdictions to deal
with them,&quot; says former U.S. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick,
who warns, &quot;We are slipping into practices which enhance
only the power of the strongest. Is this what we want to do? Someone
had better think through this question -- and soon.&quot;[7]

<p>

But Boutros-Ghali awards supremacy of rights to individuals and
groups within countries. He argues that &quot;the centuries-old
doctrine of absolute and exclusive sovereignty no longer stands.&quot;
Apparently, then, outside forces do have a right to trump national
sovereignty. Does this, then, mean or imply that true sovereignty
resides with the U.N., individual nationhood be damned?

<p>

The U.N.'s implied &quot;right&quot; to intervene in the sovereign
affairs of a country leaves all member countries vulnerable including
the U.S. For example, the next time Korean-Americans bear the
brunt of a Los Angeles riot, the South Korean government could
ask the U.N. to intervene to protect its citizens' rights. It
couldn't happen now because the U.S. would veto the move procedurally
and militarily. But it could happen in the future, especially
if the U.N. has a standing military governed by a liberal world
elite.

<p>

<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>

<p>

The national debate fostered by Specialist New's case is important.
It comes at a time when American troops are involved in peacekeeping
missions around the world. It has taken the courageous act of
one soldier to highlight an issue that deserves serious debate
and resolution.

<title>A TWO-YEAR UPDATE ON HOMOSEXUALS IN THE MILITARY</title>

<p>

<h2>A TWO-YEAR UPDATE ON<br>
HOMOSEXUALS IN THE<br>
MILITARY</h2>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

<i>by</i>

<p>

<i>Lieutenant Colonel Robert L. Maginnis (U.S.A., Ret.)</i></center>

<p>

One of Bill Clinton's first acts as president was to try to pry
open the military to service by homosexuals. That effort met with
great opposition and led to a Democratic Congress codifying the
military's long-standing ban on homosexual service. But the Clinton
administration did an end run around that law and wrote implementing
regulations that are inconsistent with the law and that have caused
considerable confusion.

<p>

The second anniversary of the implementation of these regulations
was used to expose that confusion. On February 27, 1996, the Washington-based
Servicemembers Legal Defense Network, an advocacy organization
for homosexuals in the military, claimed to have documented 363
cases in the last year in which military officials violated the
Clinton administration's homosexual regulations by directly asking
members about their sexual orientation or harassing members suspected
of being homosexual. As evidence, it cited rising discharges for
homosexuality.[1]

<p>

The Pentagon discharged 722 homosexual service members in fiscal
1995, compared with 597 in 1994. The Pentagon attributes the 17
percent increase to a different reporting method by the Air Force.
There were 949 discharges for homosexuality in 1991, 708 in 1992
and 682 in 1993.[2]

<p>

Prior to 1994 the Air Force, when it found homosexual activity
during basic training, discharged that person for &quot;fraudulent
enlistment&quot; rather than for homosexuality. This procedure
changed in 1994, and that's why there is an increase in the number
of homosexual discharges in 1995. Discounting 163 Air Force discharges
that fit this category, the Pentagon's 1995 figure would be 559,
the lowest in many years.[3]

<p>

The Servicemembers Legal Defense Network has accused military
officials of overstepping their bounds to conduct &quot;witch
hunts&quot; to find evidence to discharge service members for
homosexuality. It cited the case of an Army woman who charged
that several drunken male soldiers had attempted to rape her.
She reported the incident, but her commander dismissed it. She
alleges the men then started rumors that she was a
lesbian and that this led to an investigation. The Army says it
dropped the case against the woman and is investigating whether
the commander went too far.[4]

<p>

Military investigators and commanders are also accused of pursuing
wide-ranging inquiries aimed at identifying homosexual members.
But the Pentagon dismisses the allegations of abuse. It claims
to have &quot;thoroughly investigated&quot; them to ensure fair
application of the policy.

<p>

The confusion about homosexual service is prompted by the stark
differences between Clinton's regulations and the law which is
a codified version of the military's long-standing ban. The Clinton
administration's regulations are contrary to the law passed by
Congress and signed by the President on November 30, 1993. Consider
the major differences:

<p><ul>

<li>The Clinton regulations [DOD Directives 1332.14 and 1332.30]
drop the principled statement that &quot;homosexuality is incompatible
with military service.&quot;

<p>

<li>The law [10 U.S.C. &#167; 654] forbids service by homosexuals.
The Clinton regulations permit service by &quot;celibate&quot;
homosexuals.

<p>

<li>The law requires the discharge of people with a &quot;propensity&quot;
to engage in homosexual conduct. The Clinton regulations redefine
&quot;propensity&quot; to mean the narrow term &quot;likelihood.&quot;

<p>

<li>The law relies on commander discretion to initiate investigations.
The Clinton regulations create a &quot;criminal-like&quot; standard
before investigations can be initiated. According to Secretary
of Defense William Perry, attending gay pride parades, frequenting
gay bars, and possessing gay materials are not &quot;credible&quot;
evidence to initiate an investigation.

<p>

<li>The Clinton regulations prevent military criminal investigators
from investigating adult private consensual sexual misconduct
(sodomy and adultery). The law relies on commander discretion
to initiate investigations.

<p>

<li>The law forbids homosexual service for readiness reasons,
but, contrary to 200 years of military practice, Clinton's Defense
Department no longer considers homosexual behavior a marker for
increased security risk. And information discovered during a security
investigation cannot be used for adverse action without high-level
political permission.

</ul><p>

<center><h3>STATUS OF FEDERAL COURT CASES</h3></center>

<p>

Confusion on the issue of homosexuals in the military is amplified
by the many pending federal court cases. There are five military
homosexual cases now pending at the federal appellate court level
and three cases at the district court level.[5] Most of these cases
involve servicemembers complaining that their constitutional rights
have been violated by Clinton's regulations and sidestep a frontal
attack on the law which clearly denies service by homosexuals.

<p><ul>

<li><I>Abel v. Perry</I> was heard on January 16, 1996 in the
United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. This case
involves six servicemembers who won at the district court level,
claiming that the Pentagon violated their First and Fifth Amendment
rights. This case contests Clinton's regulations and avoids the
plain meaning of the law. A decision is expected this spring.

<p>

<li><I>Thomasson v. Perry</I> was heard on December 5, 1995 in
the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. It
involves a Naval officer who complains that his discharge for
homosexuality violates his First and Fifth Amendment rights. The
government won at the trial court level. A decision is expected
this spring.

<p>

<li><I>Selland v. Department of Defense</I> was decided at the
district court level for the government on October 31, 1995. The
case was brought by a Naval officer dismissed for declaring himself
a homosexual. The plaintiff has indicated he will appeal, but
that appeal will be delayed until a decision is announced in the
<I>Thomasson v. Perry</I> case.

<p>

<li><I>Phillips v. Perry </I>will be heard on March 4, 1996 in
the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. This
case involves a sailor who claims his discharge is based on homosexual
&quot;status&quot; when in fact the Navy was swayed by his admission
of misconduct. He also claims there are sexual acts that are guaranteed
protection within a constitutionally protected zone of privacy.
He lost his complaint at the trial court level. A decision is
expected this summer.

<p>

<li><I>Richenberg v. Perry</I> will be heard this spring in the
United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. This Air
Force officer was discharged for homosexuality and lost at the
trial court level.

<p>

<li>Three cases are pending at the federal district court level.
They are: <I>Thorne v. Department of Defense</I> (U.S. District
Court for the Eastern District of Virginia; brought by a Naval
officer); <I>Holmes v. California National Guard</I> (U.S. District
Court for the Northern District of California; brought by a National
Guardsman); and <I>Watson v. Perry</I> (U.S. District Court for
the Western District of Washington; brought by a Naval officer).

</ul><p>

The Family Research Council has participated as an amicus (friend
of the court) in the five appellate cases. It was granted the
unusual opportunity to make oral argument in <I>Thomasson v. Perry,</I>
where FRC defended the law and the Clinton Justice Department
defended the faulty regulations. It will closely monitor the progress
of the three district court cases.

<p>

<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>

<p>

A Justice Department attorney announced during the <I>Abel v.
Perry</I> hearing that seven avowed homosexuals have rebutted
the presumption that they will engage in illicit conduct. They
now serve uncontested. This is a flagrant violation of the law
but has been allowed because of the faulty Clinton regulations.
Unless these regulations are changed, more avowed homosexuals
will serve, despite clear congressional intent to the contrary.

<p>

The intent of the law has always been to deny service to homosexuals.
It is the Constitutional responsibility of Congress under Article
1, Section 8 to write the rules and regulations for the military.
After exhaustive hearings in 1993, the Congress by a large majority
codified the military's long-standing ban on homosexual service.
The law denies service to all homosexuals, both those in and those
out of the closet.

<p>

It is hoped that Congress or a future administration will right
the Clinton administration's faulty regulations. The regulations
must be rewritten to echo the intent of the law. Meanwhile, it
is expected that either the <I>Abel</I> or <I>Thomasson</I> case
will be appealed to the Supreme Court this summer. FRC will file
a motion to argue as an amicus in that case to defend the law
which is based on the will of the American people and the findings
of the 1993 Congressional hearings on the issue of homosexuals
in the military.

<h2>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS<br>
ABOUT THE DEFENSE OF<br>
MARRIAGE</h2>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

<i>Robert H. Knight</i></center>

<p>

<b>Q: In restricting marriage to one man and one woman, aren't
you imposing your beliefs on others?</b>

<p>

A: Marriage has been the foundation of civilization for thousands
of years in cultures around the world. It is the single most important
social institution, and it is the basis for the procreation of
children and the heart of family life. Those who are trying to
radically redefine it for their own purposes are the ones who
are trying to impose their values on the rest of the population.
Ordinary people did not pick this fight. They are not the aggressors.
They are merely defending the basic morality that has sustained
the culture for everyone against a radical attack.

<p>

<b>Q: Oh, come on. Whom does it really hurt if a same-sex couple
want to get married?</b>

<p>

A: When homosexual couples seek state approval and all the benefits
that the state reserves for married couples, they impose the law
on everyone. According non-marital relationships the same status
as marriage would mean that millions of people would be disenfranchised
by their own governments. The state would be telling them that
their beliefs are no longer valid, and would turn the civil rights
laws into a battering ram against them:

<p><ul>

<li>Business men and women would be required to provide &quot;family&quot;
health benefits to homosexual couples.

<p>

<li>Children would be taught in schools that homosexual sex is
the moral equivalent of marital love.

<p>

<li>Same-sex &quot;marriage&quot; would facilitiate the adoption
of children by homosexual couples.

<p>

<li>Sex-based distinctions in the law would be removed (as was
proposed in the rejected Equal Rights Amendment).

</ul><p>

Law is not a suggestion, but, as George Washington observed, it
is force. Official state sanction of same-sex relationships as
&quot;marriage&quot; would bring the full apparatus of the state
against those who believe that marriage is between one man and
one woman. Traditional morality would, in effect, be outlawed.

<p>

<b>Q: But if two people -- any two people -- love each other,
why not let them marry?</b>

<p>

A: Marriage is not just a matter of feelings. It is the specifically
defined legal, social, economic and spiritual union of a man and
a woman. The two sexes must be present for it to be marriage.
If that definition is radically altered based on the &quot;feelings&quot;
of those in other relationships, then the sky is the limit. There
is no logical reason for not letting several people marry, or
for gutting other requirements, such as minimum age, blood relative
status or even the limitation of the relationship to human beings.

<p>

<b>Q: Don't morals change? Haven't we heard all these tired phrases
used in defense of not letting women vote or even in defense of
slavery?</b>

<p>

A: Various social movements have succeeded because they were in
accord with natural law and the basic precepts of the moral code.
Homosexuality has never been considered morally good, and it is
a quantum leap from ending slavery to saying that homosexuality
must now be considered good, healthy and worthy of state-protected
benefits. Homosexuals enjoy all the rights every other citizen
already has -- they can vote, own property, etc.-- but they cannot
claim special treatment beyond those rights. Anytime they achieve
that, they threaten the civil rights of those who disagree with
them.

<p>

<b>Q: For years, in some Southern states, blacks and whites were
prevented from marrying by anti-miscegenation laws. Eventually,
the courts overturned these laws. Aren't same-sex couples being
similarly discriminated against? Isn't it only a matter of time
before these repressive laws are also overturned?</b>

<p>

A: As Colin Powell has observed, skin color and sexual behavior
are entirely different. The first is a benign, inborn characteristic
that has no bearing on conduct or character; the second is behaviorally-based
and has everything to do with character, morality and society's
basic rules of conduct. If the civil rights laws begin deviating
into behavior and away from race, ethnic origin, place of birth
or other immutable characteristics, there is no stopping point.
New laws would have to be coined almost daily to accommodate the
flood of claims based on behavior (smokers, compulsive gamblers,
pornography fanatics, sex addicts and pedophiles could all claim
new &quot;rights&quot; to protection against discrimination).
One non-immutable characteristic that does get protection is religion,
because that is enshrined in the Constitution. But there is no
constitutional right to engage in sodomy (see <I>Bowers v. Hardwick</I>)[1]
and demand that the state elevate it into protected status.

<p>

<b>Q: But studies show that homosexuals are born that way. How
then can you blame them for their condition?</b>

<p>

A: Nobody is &quot;blaming&quot; anyone for having homosexual
desires. The &quot;genetic&quot; studies that have been publicized
have been conducted by self-styled homosexual activists or have
been misrepresented in the media. The studies themselves typically
have tiny sample sizes, biased selection, and other major methodological
flaws, and are not replicated by reputable scientists.[2] By contrast,
70 years of therapeutic counseling and case studies show a remarkable
consistency concerning the origins of the homosexual impulse as
an uncompleted gender identity seeking after its own sex to replace
what was not fully developed.[3] Do homosexuals choose to be gay?
Mostly, no, but they can choose their behavior, and they can change
their orientation,[4] as researchers Masters and Johnson showed in
their landmark studies[5] and as numerous examples of successful
personal transformation testify.[6]

<p>

<b>Q: Isn't the traditional view of marriage religious in nature?
And if so, doesn't the restriction of marriage to one man and
one woman violate the religious beliefs of those who disagree?</b>

<p>

A: Although marriage does indeed arise from religious traditions,
most notably the Bible, it is an independently quantifiable good
for society. Hence, the state has an interest in preserving and
protecting the special status of marriage, regardless of religious
beliefs. A society can get along just fine without any homosexuality,
but no society can get along without marriage. That is why the
state encourages marriage. In 1885, the Supreme Court felt so
strongly that marriage was to be protected that it declared it
as a requirement for admission of new states to the Union. Any
prospective state, the court said, had to have law resting &quot;on
the basis of the idea of the family, as consisting in and springing
from the union for life of one man and one woman in the holy estate
of matrimony; the sure foundation of all that is stable and noble
in our civilization, the best guaranty of that reverent morality
which is the source of all beneficent progress in social and political
improvement.&quot;[7]

<p>

<b>Q: What about childless couples? Since you say that marriage
must be protected partly because of its importance in forming
families, does this mean that heterosexual couples who do not
have children shouldn't get marriage licenses?</b>

<p>

A: Of course not. Although most people marry with the intention
of someday starting families, the married couples who do not have
children still have the potential for becoming mothers and fathers,
either biologically or through adoption. Marriage is a societal
good even without children, as husbands and wives serve as role
models for children in their neighborhoods. Procreation is an
important aspect of society's high regard for marriage, but it
is not the only reason marriage is protected. Children do not
benefit when homosexuality is presented as a neutral or positive
lifestyle choice.

<p>

<b>Q: But with the threat of AIDS and other diseases among promiscuous,
homosexual men, wouldn't it be a societal good to encourage homosexual
monogamy?</b>

<p>

A: In cities where homosexual monogamy is already being encouraged,
AIDS and other sexually-transmitted diseases are skyrocketing.[8]
It is not &quot;homophobia&quot; that is causing this, but the
behavior itself, which is destructive emotionally, physically
and morally to individuals, families and societies. That is why
it has been discouraged in all successful cultures. Socrates and
Plato wrote that homosexuality was harmful to individuals and
society and should be discouraged. Even in &quot;steady&quot;
homosexual relationships, dangerous sex occurs, since the defining
homosexual sex act is patently unhealthy by any standard. State
sanction of homosexuality in any form is an invitation to the
young to experiment with something that may prove deadly. Any
public health benefits available by discouraging promiscuous homosexual
activity can be achieved without redefining traditional marriage,
which is per se a profoundly important public health measure.

<p>

Besides, homosexual literature acknowledges that homosexual 
&quot;monogamy&quot; is largely fictional. Most homosexual relationships 
are fleeting. Those that endure more than a few years do so because of an 
agreement to have outside partners. As <I>New Republic</I> editor Andrew
Sullivan, a homosexual, writes in his book <I>Virtually Normal</I>,
&quot;the openness of the contract&quot; of homosexual &quot;marriage&quot;
reflects &quot;greater understanding of the need for extramarital
outlets between two men than between a man and a woman.&quot;
In other words, the homosexual concept of &quot;monogamy&quot;
is non-monogamous. Homosexual activist Michaelangelo Signorile
frankly admits that the goal of homosexual activists is to &quot;fight
for same-sex marriage and its benefits and then, once granted,
redefine the institution of marriage completely, to demand the
right to marry not as a way of adhering to society's moral codes
but rather to debunk a myth and radically alter an archaic 
institution....&quot;[9]

<p>

<b>Q: Don't most people want homosexuals to be treated fairly?</b>

<p>

A: Yes. Most people have no ill will toward homosexuals, but this
does not mean that a tiny segment of the population (less than
2 percent) should be allowed to radically redefine society's moral
code. Even in liberal Hawaii, recent polls show that more than
70 percent of residents oppose same-sex &quot;marriage,&quot;
and national polls show that about two-thirds of respondents oppose
same-sex &quot;marriage.&quot; This is not about tolerance, but
about a tiny group seeking to use the law to impose its version
of morality on everyone else.

<p>

<b>Q: Still, don't homosexuals suffer discrimination when they
can't marry?</b>

<p>

A: No. Homosexuals have precisely the same right to marry as anyone
else. Marriage is the bringing together of the two sexes. That
is the whole point. To enter marriage, you must meet its qualifications.
Any attempt to get around the rules that everyone else plays by
is an attempt to have special rights, not equal rights. Eliminating
an entire sex from the picture and then calling it &quot;marriage&quot;
is not a mere expansion of an institution, but rather the destruction
of a principle.

<p>

<b>Q: What about domestic partnerships? If you won't go along
with same-sex &quot;marriage,&quot; why not at least allow committed
same-sex couples to get some benefits?</b>

<p>

A: The state should never be in the business of encouraging unhealthy
behavior by granting special benefits for it. A homosexual life
does not offer the richness of the complementary relationship
that men and women find in marriage and family life. People should
not be written off as if they can do no better than be mired in
an unhealthy, unnatural behavior. The more that homosexuality
is encouraged, the more damage will be wreaked among individuals,
families and society. This is not compassion but its opposite:
a ruthless social Darwinism that devalues people as impulse-driven
incorrigibles. Each human soul is of inestimable worth, and homosexuals
are no different from anyone else. They deserve the truth, not
an officially sanctioned lie.

<li><I>Bowers v. Hardwick</I> 478 U.S. 186, 190 (1986).  In rejecting
the claim, the Court said, &quot;Nor are we inclined to take a
more expansive view of our authority to discover new fundamental
rights imbedded in the Due Process Clause.  The Court is most
vulnerable and comes nearest to illegitimacy when it deals with
judge-made constitutional law having little or no cognizable roots
in the language or design of the Constitution....There should
be, therefore, great resistance to expand the substantive reach
of those Clauses, particularly if it requires redefining the category
of rights deemed to be fundamental.&quot;

<h2>DESIGNER DRUGS MAKE A<br>
COMEBACK</h2>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

<i>by</i>

<p>

<i>Robert L. Maginnis</i></center>

<p>

A 1960s-era designer drug is making a dramatic comeback and may
do to the 1990s what cocaine did to the 1980s. The use of methamphetamine,
known on the street as speed, ice, crank, crystal meth or the
&quot;poor man's coke,&quot; is rising dramatically.

<p>

<center><h3>WHAT IS METH?</h3></center>

<p>

Meth is a synthetic central-nervous system stimulant of the amphetamine
family. It was discovered by a Japanese chemist in 1919, and was
used extensively by all sides during World War II to fight fatigue
and enhance performance.

<p>

In small doses, meth has been used by combat pilots to keep alert,
and by astronauts to be ready for critical decisions at the end
of long missions. A <I>USA Today</I> story last fall claimed President
John F. Kennedy used small quantities, and that German dictator
Adolph Hitler was known to be a meth abuser.[1]

<p>

<center><h3>HOW DOES METH AFFECT THE USER?</h3></center>

<p>

Larry Lewman, Oregon State Examiner, said, &quot;It's not as lethal
[as crack], but it's cheaper. And it causes a toxic psychosis
and (users) can be absolutely irrational for days.&quot;[2]

<p>

Meth can have a bizarre effect on some. While high on meth, Eric
Smith thought his 14-year-old son was demon-possessed. He murdered
his son, cut off the boy's head, and tossed it out of the window
of his van.[3]

<p>

Such irrational and often violent behavior is common among meth
abusers. According to Dr. Alex Stalcup, former medical director
of the Haight-Asbury free clinic, &quot;I have [meth] patients
come in with as much as 19 to 20 days of no sleep. They are very
dangerous, paranoid, talking weapons. Some hold themselves in
a house, take hostages and begin shooting out the windows.&quot;[4]

<p>

Ronald Siegel, a psychopharmacologist at the UCLA school of medicine,
said of meth users, &quot;They're wired to be alert, on guard
and primed for action.&quot;[5]

<p>

The downside of meth's euphoria is an amphetamine psychosis. It
can last for months. The person becomes agitated, on edge and
paranoid. A meth crash can be deadly for children, spouses and
friends of the user.

<p>

The signs of meth abuse are: weight loss, irritability, excitability,
paranoia, wandering attention, sleeplessness for days and then
sleeping for 24 to 36 hours straight.[6]

<p>

<center><h3>WHERE DOES METH COME FROM?</h3></center>

<p>

In the late 1980s, traffickers and clandestine laboratory operators
discovered that ma huang, an extract from the ephedra plant, the
world's oldest known cultivated plant, could be used to produce
methamphetamine. This discovery prompted the U.S. government to
impose controls on ephedrine.

<p>

The ephedra plant is grown in China, India, the Czech Republic
and, at one time, was sown as a ground cover in the western U.S.
by the Bureau of Plant Industry. Frontier Americans called ephedrine
&quot;Mormon tea&quot; because it was drunk by Mormons in lieu
of regular coffee and tea, which are off-limits. It was also called
&quot;whorehouse tea&quot; because settlers believed it cured
venereal disease.[7]

<p>

Although ephedrine is not sold in large quantities for fear it
will be used to produce meth, it is legally available as a treatment
for asthma. Pseudoephedrine is readily available as a nasal decongestant.
Ephedrine tablets are also sold as an herbal supplement under
such names as &quot;Trim Easy,&quot; &quot;Ecstasy&quot; and 
&quot;Bliss&quot; at rock concerts or hip clothing boutiques and 
&quot;Ephedra&quot; in health food stores.[8] It can be found in some new 
herbal sodas. Bodybuilders also use it for short-term energy boosts.

<p>

In 1988, Congress passed the Chemical Diversion and Trafficking
Act, which imposed controls on bulk ephedrine powder. Thereafter,
meth producers sought international sources and began to switch
to pseudoephedrine as their source chemical.

<p>

Meth can be &quot;cooked&quot; by amateurs with a few simple chemicals
in makeshift labs. Some of these labs can produce up to 100 pounds
at a time. In February 1995, Mexican authorities seized a lab
that could produce 2,640 pounds of meth a month.[9]

<p>

Even a makeshift lab can take $4,000 in raw ingredients and produce
eight pounds of meth worth more than $50,000 on the street.[10] Besides
the danger of arrest for producing illegal substances, lab mistakes
can be catastrophic.

<p>

On Christmas Day, 1995, a mobile home near Aguanga, California
burst into flames. Three children died and an out-of-control meth
kitchen was blamed.[11]

<p>

Authorities busted 419 clandestine labs in California in 1994,
and the deadly environmental residue from these labs cost that
state more than $1 million in clean-up.[12] Although the number of
meth lab seizures rose to 683 in 1989, they dramatically declined
with new laws restricting ephedrine's availability.[13] Today, the
number of labs is rising once again as alternative ephedrine sources
have been found.

<center><h3>WHO USES METH?</h3></center>

<p>

Meth is tailor-made for the fast-paced 1990s. It helps suppress
the appetite, gives self-confidence, provides an extended feeling
of euphoria, and provides &quot;Energizer&quot; levels of get-up-and-go.

<p>

Kathy Paddock, a services coordinator for Terros, an Arizona-based
drug and mental health rehabilitation center, said, &quot;We're
seeing young people in their teens, young adults, everyone. It's
the drug of the '90s. People are needing to go fast -- alter their
moods. The meths are replacing crack.&quot;[14]

<p>

One study found that 75 percent of meth users were employed white
men between the ages 25 and 35.[15] Robert Booth, a psychiatry professor
at Colorado University's medical school, says meth attracts middle-class
housewives with too much to do.[16] <I>The U.S. News &amp; World Report</I>
describes meth users as white, 18-to-34-year-old working class
people, &quot;some of them gay and many of them women.&quot;[17]

<p>

Ed Mayer, head of the narcotics enforcement team in Jackson County,
Oregon, says meth is &quot;cheaper [than cocaine] and it gives
people a longer high.&quot;[18] That's why it is growing in popularity,
especially among adolescent girls who want to lose weight and
boys who use it as a sexual stimulant.[19]

<p>

<center><h3>THE NEW METH EPIDEMIC</h3></center>

<p>

Just how bad is the meth &quot;epidemic&quot; and what are the
consequences? Consider:

<p><ul>

<li>The Department of Justice reports that meth abuse has risen
between 500 and 800 percent among young adults over the past five
years.[20]

<p>

<li>The nation's medical examiners report a 144 percent rise in
meth-related deaths from 1992 to 1994.[21] There were 1,816 meth-related
deaths reported from 1991 to 1994.[22] Eighty percent of these were
reported in just <i>four</i> big western cities.[23]

<p>

<li>Meth-related hospital emergency room admissions have risen
366 percent over the last 10 years in California.[24] In some local
areas they have risen 1,742 percent.[25] The problem is so bad that
in one California hospital meth babies now outnumber crack babies
by as much as seven to one.[26]

<p>

<li>In Phoenix, meth-related crimes have jumped 400 percent in
the last three years.[27] Officials believe meth is largely responsible
for a 40 percent jump in Phoenix's 1994 homicide rate. Phoenix's
law enforcement authorities also report spending 60 percent of
their time working on cases involving meth.[28]

<p>

<li>In Contra Costa County, near San Francisco, police say that
meth was involved in 89 percent of domestic disputes.[29] San Diego
County reports that meth detections among arrestees rose from
23 percent in 1991 to 45 percent in 1994.[30]

<p>

<li>Authorities in San Diego and the San Francisco Bay area report
nearly 3,000 admissions to treatment programs for meth. This is
up from only 600 in 1988.[31]

<p>

<li>Meth is making inroads elsewhere. Of 100 women recently booked
into the Minneapolis jail, 75 had meth traces in their urine.[32]
In Tacoma, Washington, police report that meth-related homicides
are on the rise.[33]

</ul><p>

Recognizing the critical nature of the coming tidal wave of meth
abuse, on March 12, 1996, Senator Diane Feinstein (D-Calif.) introduced
legislation aimed at curbing the manufacturing of methamphetamine.
The Methamphetamine Control Act of 1996, which has bipartisan
support, tightens federal regulation and reporting requirements
for the chemicals used to produce meth, and increases criminal
penalties for possession of the relevant chemicals or equipment
with the intent to manufacture the drug.

<p>

Public officials are nearly unanimous in condemning meth and warning
Americans about its likely impact. Attorney General Janet Reno
warned, &quot;There should be no question...in anybody's mind
that methamphetamine poses a real and serious threat to the citizens
of our nation.&quot;[34]

<p>

Drug Enforcement Administration head Thomas A. Constantine told
a U.S. House Judiciary subcommittee: &quot;I am concerned that
this coming epidemic could not happen at a worse time. Our nation
has not yet fully recovered from our cocaine experience, and powerful
traffickers in Mexico are seeking to make their mark on history
in much the same way the Cali Mafia did.&quot;[35]

<p>

Dr. Andrew Mecca with the California Alcohol and Drug Programs
participated in a meth study which found &quot;that we have got
a dramatic rise or epidemic level of occurrence.&quot;[36]

<p>

John Coonce, the meth task force chief for the DEA, said, &quot;We're
seeing more [meth] labs in middle American. It's an epidemic that's
getting worse.&quot;[37]

<p>

<center><h3>DRUG TRAFFICKERS FIND METH BETTER THAN CRACK</h3></center>

<p>

Today, meth is available in large quantities. Last year about
170 tons of ephedrine was converted into 136 tons of meth, which
was sold on U.S. streets for about $3.2 billion. That's enough
meth to supply 12.4 million abusers with three 10-milligram doses
a day for 365 days a year.[38]

<p>

Meth production and distribution have become a big business. In
the 1970s, meth was largely the province of motorcycle gangs.
But in the 1980s making meth from ephedrine became an easy and
lucrative alternative to processing and selling cocaine. It became
attractive because domestic traffickers could cut out middlemen
like the Colombian cartels.

<p>

There are three categories of meth traffickers. Those who traffic
in the raw materials -- primarily ephedrine or pseudoephedrine
-- to producers, those who peddle the finished product, and those
who do both.

<p>

The raw material traffickers either operate domestically or internationally.
The domestic operators divert legal ephedrine to meth lab operators.
For example, Clifton Pharmaceuticals in western Pennsylvania imported
large quantities of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine powder last
year. From the powder they made pills, which were then sold through
three mail order firms located in Florida and Kentucky. The DEA
routinely seized these products in clandestine meth labs in California.[39]

<p>

Ephedrine tablets were sold through mail order distributors in
100 and 1,000-count bottles through magazines like <I>Cosmopolitan,
High Times</I> and <I>Hustler</I>.[40] They were advertised as 
bronchodilators, energy boosters or diet aids. This practice has now been 
slowed by the 1990 Domestic Chemical Diversion Control Act, because the
DEA can now deny registration to companies whose actions are deemed
to pose an imminent threat to public health and safety. Unfortunately,
the Food and Drug Administration has yet to reclassify pseudoephedrine
as a controlled substance.

<p>

Mexican drug organizations are the primary traffickers in raw
ephedrine. They ship large quantities of ephedrine from India,
China and the Czech Republic into Mexico and then either make
meth at local labs or smuggle it into the U.S. For example, in
1994, 3.4 tons of ephedrine traveling from Zurich to Mexico City
was seized by the customs service at Dallas-Fort Worth International
Airport.[41]

<p>

Mexican finished-product traffickers have so saturated the Western
meth market as to depress its street value. In 1991, a pound of
meth cost $6,000, but today the price has been cut in half.[42] That
makes meth a real psychedelic bargain when compared to crack cocaine.
For example, $20 can buy a quarter gram of meth or one-tenth of
a gram of crack or one-sixteenth of a gram of heroin.[43]

<p>

<center><h3>HOW TO HEAD OFF THE COMING EPIDEMIC</h3></center>

<p>

This country needs a three-part, balanced strategy to stop the
meth epidemic. This strategy must include strong enforcement,
prevention, and effective meth-abuse treatment with accountability.
Enforcement begins with the right laws. Congress already has laws
that tightly control the sale of ephedrine powder, but should
consider more restrictions on the over-the-counter sale of pseudoephedrine
tablets. Feinstein's proposal closes a loophole in the Controlled
Substances Act by removing an exemption for pseudoephedrine. It
also adds needed restrictions on other chemicals used to produce
methamphetamine. Meth producers can now make cash purchases of
large quantities of red phosphorus, iodine and hydrochloric gas
-- chemicals used to make meth. There are no uniform reporting
requirements or quantity limitations for these chemicals.[44]

<p>

The pending bill would restrict access to these chemicals and
impose a civil &quot;three-strikes-and-you're-out&quot; law for
companies that are found to be selling chemicals used to make
meth. It will also increase the maximum criminal penalty for those
who possess equipment used to manufacture meth.

<p>

The second part of an effective meth-abuse prevention strategy
is to reduce demand through more effective education about the
drug's ruinous effects, which include hallucinations, addiction,
depression, paranoia and violent rages. This effort should be
spearheaded by private, non-profit groups involved in drug education
at both the national and grass-roots levels.

<p>

Finally, the strategy must include effective treatment. Treatment
funds must be controlled at the point of delivery where local
officials best understand the problem. These programs must last
long enough to give the addicts a fighting chance to recover,
and addicts must be held strictly accountable for their progress.

<p>

<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>

<p>

The methamphetamine epidemic is poised to become much worse than
the crack epidemic. Meth is cheaper, can be domestically produced
and gives the abuser a higher high that lasts much longer than
crack cocaine. Meth's downside is that it can make the abuser
incredibly violent, thus further fueling the nation's crime epidemic.
Now is the time for parents, school teachers, citizen groups,
law enforcement, government officials, church leaders and others
to act in concert to ward off this scourge before it accelerates
into overdrive, leaving millions of devastated citizens in its
wake.

<h2>HOMOSEXUAL GROUP AIMS<br>
TO SILENCE OPPONENTS</h2>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

<i>Robert Knight and Ken Ervin</i></center>

<p>

Under the guise of &quot;condemning hate speech,&quot; a homosexual
activist group, Parents, Friends &amp; Families of Lesbians And
Gays (PFLAG) has launched a TV and newspaper advertising campaign
designed to smear and silence opponents of the homosexual agenda.

<p>

Back when it was formed in 1981, the Washington, D.C.-based PFLAG
was a small, obscure group of parental activists. In recent years,
it has become a major player to promote homosexuality as normal
and healthy. PFLAG's mission statement focuses on three areas:

<p><ul>

<li>Support - chapter groups meet in various cities to offer support
and plan strategies;

<p>

<li>Advocacy - testifying and lobbying on both state and federal
levels in favor of homosexual-friendly legislation;

<p>

<li>Education - through the publishing of various &quot;fact&quot;
sheets, audio workshops, conferences and seminars.

</ul><p>

PFLAG's goal in educating society is to &quot;dispel myths, report
on scientific research, [and] explain religious teachings.&quot;[1]
However, the group has disseminated much inaccurate and misleading
information concerning homosexuality. For example, in its brochure
<I>Why Is My Child Gay?</I>, the reader is told that &quot;about
10 percent of the population is gay.&quot; This inflated figure
is based on the discredited works of Alfred Kinsey, author of
<I>Sexual Behavior in the Human Male</I>. The brochure also leads
the reader to believe that scientists have found evidence that
homosexuality is a biological predisposition, but no credible
evidence exists for this assertion.[2]

<p>

PFLAG has amassed considerable financial backing to launch its
latest campaign against opponents of the homosexual agenda. The
$1 million effort follows one of the many blueprints for propaganda
warfare set forth in the book <I>After the Ball: How America Will
Conquer Its Fear of Gays in the 90's</I>.[3]

<p>

PFLAG has chosen a tactic called &quot;Bracketing,&quot; which
is best described by <I>After the Ball</I> authors Marshall Kirk
and Hunter Madsen:

<p><blockquote>

<i>&quot;The best way to make homohatred look bad is to vilify those
who victimize gays. The public should be shown images of ranting 
homohaters whose associated traits and attitudes appall and anger 
Middle America. . . .In TV and print, images of victimizers
can be combined with those of their gay victims by a method propagandists
call 'bracket technique.' For example, for several seconds an unctuous
beady-eyed Southern preacher is shown pounding the pulpit in rage against
'those perverted, abominable creatures.' While his tirade continues over 
the soundtrack, the picture switches to heart-rending photos of badly 
beaten persons, or of gays who look decent, harmless, and likable; and 
then we cut back to the poisonous face of the preacher. The contrast 
speaks for itself. The viewer will ordinarily recoil from these images 
of victimizers, thinking automatically: 'I don't like those maniacs,
don't want to be like them, and would be ashamed if others thought I was 
like them. Surely I'm more compassionate and sophisticated, because I 
don't share their irrational hatred of gays.' Every time a viewer runs 
through this comparative self-appraisal, he reinforces a self-definition 
that consciously rejects homohatred and validates sympathy for gay 
victims. Exactly what we want.&quot;</i>[4]

</blockquote><p>

And apparently that is exactly what PFLAG wants, because they've
followed Kirk and Madsen's game plan almost to the letter.

<p><blockquote>

<i>&quot;One of the two 30-second [TV] spots dramatizes gay-bashing,
where a young man is chased by a group and then beaten; the other depicts 
a young woman holding a gun as she considers suicide. Visuals then cut 
to TV comments from the Rev. [Pat] Robertson, the Rev. Jerry Falwell 
and Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.).&quot;</i>[5]

</blockquote><p>

The PFLAG campaign, Project Open Mind, is expected to run for
the next two to five years. It is currently being marketed in
Houston, Atlanta, Washington, D.C., and Tulsa, Oklahoma. New stations
are being sought in five Midwest and Pacific Northwest markets.
The PFLAG effort coincides with a major effort to press the homosexual
agenda on several fronts:

<p><ul>

<li>Homosexuals in the military - the effort to force the inclusion
of open homosexuals in all branches of the U.S. military;

<p>

<li>Homosexual &quot;marriage&quot; - the campaign to accord marital
status to same-sex couples;

<p>

<li>Homosexual adoption - the drive to sanction custody and adoption
of children by same-sex couples;

<p>

<li>Civil rights for homosexuals - the wide-ranging campaign to
bully the U.S. legal system into granting special rights and privileges
to homosexuals on the grounds that homosexuals qualify for 
&quot;minority&quot; status.

</ul><p>

Coming under increasingly shrill attack from PFLAG and other homosexual
activist groups are orthodox Christianity and &quot;organized
religion.&quot; On this battleground, however, the homosexual
community seems fragmented over the best way to attack. One segment
of activists believes the best course of action is blatant, 
&quot;in-your-face&quot; defiance. This consists of staged, eye-catching 
media events like gay pride parades. During the June 25, 1995 New York 
City parade, activists, some in nun's habits and others in various 
stages of undress, once again marched past St. Patrick's Cathedral 
carrying signs with such slogans as &quot;Hatred is not sacred.&quot;

<p>

The belief of another faction is that this kind of activism has
damaged the homosexual cause politically and intellectually. During
the visit of Pope John Paul II to New York City, six men unfurled
a banner from a sixth-floor window in Saks Fifth Avenue facing
St. Patrick's Cathedral. The banner, which read &quot;Condoms
Save Lives,&quot; was removed and the men were arrested. Citing
this botched effort, lesbian writer Camille Paglia calls for homosexual
activists to turn from attacks on the church and concentrate more
on intellectual discourse. Yet the author, near the end of her
argument for a more intellectual approach, still can't resist
the urge to take pot-shots at religion:

<p><blockquote>

<i>&quot;Mottos I would have liked to see fly on violet satin over
St. Patrick's: Penis Power; Long Live Gay Love; Paradise Now; Sympathy 
for the Devil; Flesh and Fantasy; There Is No God; Eat of My Body; Sex 
Is Sacred; Art, Pleasure, Sex; Dionysus Lives; Bring Back Babylon; 
Pagans Unite; Disobey Authority; Free Your Mind.&quot;</i>[6]

</blockquote><p>

Another group has chosen to carry out its attacks by infiltrating
church hierarchy. Episcopal Bishop John Spong appeared as keynote
speaker at a November 10, 1995 symposium hosted by PFLAG and held
at Foundry United Methodist Church in Washington, D.C. (currently
attended by Bill and Hillary Clinton and, until early 1995, by
Bob and Elizabeth Dole). According to an eyewitness account by
Mark Tooley of the Institute on Religion and Democracy, Bishop
Spong's address ridiculed the Christmas story, praised homosexual
&quot;marriage,&quot; declared the Ten Commandments &quot;immoral,&quot;
and referred to the Apostle Paul as a &quot;self-hating, gay man.&quot;

<p>

Increasingly, opponents of the homosexual cause are being labeled
as &quot;bigots&quot; and &quot;haters&quot; by mainstream journalists.
For example, the <I>Washington Post</I>'s Richard Cohen recently
queried, &quot;Where is the Republican who will look certain conservative
Christians in the eye and call them the bigots they are? Where
are the Christian clergymen, like those of the civil rights era,
who will condemn ignorance and bigotry, and exalt tolerance and
understanding? Who in the GOP field will assert that homophobia
is not a family value?&quot;[7]

<p>

Even while homosexuals continue their media assault, few major
political figures dare to evince any criticism of the gay agenda.
Part of this is due to a wholesale media blitz. As syndicated
columnist Cal Thomas has remarked, &quot;Evidence of this compromise
is everywhere, from the open recruitment of 'gay journalists'
to a convention of the National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association
meeting in Washington last month. A copy of the program shows
that not only were representatives of major press organizations
in attendance as participants, they also contributed substantially
to the cost of the event.&quot;[8] These companies included ABC,
NBC, CBS, <I>The New York Times</I>, <I>USA Today</I> and the
Associated Press, which recruited homosexuals and openly sided
with the partisan homosexual agenda.

<p>

Homosexual activists have cultivated a relationship with the press
to such a degree that its ability to report fairly and objectively
on the issues has been seriously impaired. At one PFLAG meeting
in Maryland on Nov. 21, 1993, according to an eyewitness account
by Peter LaBarbera, homosexual researcher Dean Hamer told the
audience that he was pleased with media coverage. Hamer, a geneticist
with the National Cancer Institute who is under investigation
for fraud in connection with the first of two gay gene studies
he authored, said, &quot;If you tell the press what to write about
a scientific study, they'll write it.&quot;[9] He added that he told
reporters that his study's findings show that sexual orientation
is like being &quot;left-handed,&quot; and that they obliged him:
&quot;That's what I told them to say, and they said it.&quot;[10]

<p>

Liberal politicians are increasingly looking to groups like PFLAG
for support in their efforts to restructure and realign both government
and society. &quot;PFLAG is writing the final chapter in the
nation's 200-year-old struggle for civil rights. I don't know
if you realize how important you are,&quot; says Rep. Gerry Studds
(D-Mass.).[11]

<p>

PFLAG's campaign is by no means an arbitrary attack. It's just
one small piece of a much larger battle plan. The goal is to silence
all opponents of the homosexual agenda, and harness government
and corporate power to enforce it.

<title>PRISONER LAWSUITS: A TOOL FOR JUSTICE OR OBSTRUCTION?</title>

<h2>PRISONER LAWSUITS:<br>
A TOOL FOR JUSTICE OR<br>
OBSTRUCTION?</h2>

<p>

Lawsuits brought by prisoners cost Americans millions of dollars
and make a mockery of the justice system. One murderer sued more
than 300 times, claiming he caught a cold from eating off of paper
plates and wasn't given enough fruit juice. A serial killer on
California's death row who sexually assaulted, tortured and mutilated
five teenage girls, sued prison officials for &quot;cruel and
unusual punishment&quot; because they served him soggy sandwiches.
A Missouri rapist, robber and kidnapper sued to have prisoners
treated to salad bars and brunches on weekends and holidays.[1]

<p>

Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee,
is promoting an inmate lawsuit reform bill. In his words, &quot;It's
high time to stop this outrage against taxpayers. It must not
continue any longer.&quot;[2]

<p>

Lawmakers also want to halt inmate litigation which delays executions
and overturns state court decisions via federal habeas corpus
petitions. Reforming the federal habeas corpus review process
will help repair the sagging credibility of our criminal justice
system.

<p>

Our system is supposed to serve victims and criminals by ensuring
that offenders receive appropriate and swift punishments which
act as deterrence to future crime. Unfortunately, habeas corpus
petitions, which may be well intended, delay justice and therefore
damage law enforcement's credibility. This must change.

<p>

<center><h3>WHAT IS HABEAS CORPUS?</h3></center>

<p>

Habeas corpus petitions allege that the prisoner's federal constitutional
rights were violated. State and federal prisoners can challenge
the validity of their convictions and the appropriateness of their
sentences by filing these petitions in a federal court. If a federal
judge agrees, he can issue writs ordering the prisoner's freedom,
reducing his sentence or having his case remanded for retrial
or resentencing.

<p>

Habeas corpus is Latin for &quot;you have the body.&quot; It requires
the prison warden to produce a prisoner to determine whether or
not the inmate is imprisoned lawfully and whether or not he should
be released from custody. A state prisoner who has exhausted normal
state appeals may continue to litigate his conviction or sentence
by applying for habeas corpus in a federal district court.

<p>

A growing number of Americans view such appeals as judicial obstruction.
After all, in spite of overwhelming evidence, many are filed by
death row criminals who litigate solely to delay their execution.
For example:

<p><ul>

<li>In 1974, Mitchell Blazak was convicted and sentenced to death
on two counts of murder. Between 1977 and 1988 he filed five unsuccessful
petitions with Arizona courts. In 1988, he successfully persuaded
a federal district court to vacate his 1974 trial because it failed
to consider his mental competence at the time. Crucial evidence
was lost by the federal court during the habeas corpus evidentiary
hearing, and as a result the state could not retry him and settled
for a negotiated plea agreement. Because Blazak had his presentence
credit of more than 19 years, he was returned to prison for less
than six months and released.[3]

<p>

<li>In 1977, Clarence Allen was convicted and sentenced to life
in prison. From prison he arranged for the murder of three people
who testified against him for which he was then convicted and
sentenced to death. Six years later, the California Supreme Court
affirmed the death sentence. Over the next two years, his federal
habeas corpus petitions were denied, and the U.S. Supreme Court
declined to review his case. But on September 2, 1988 a sympathetic
federal district judge issued a stay of execution which remains
in effect today -- 22 years after his first murder.[4]

<p>

<li>William Bonin was convicted and sentenced to death for the
1979 murders of 14 boys he lured inside his van, sexually assaulted
and then strangled. After nearly two decades of delays, Bonin
and 31 other Orange County, California death-row inmates have
exhausted their appeals and are awaiting execution.[5]

<p>

<li>In 1982, Robert Buell kidnapped, brutally raped and strangled
an 11-year-old Ohio girl. He was found guilty and sentenced to
death. Over a period of 12 years, he filed eight separate judicial
actions involving 36 judges. He recently filed papers in federal
court seeking yet another hearing.[6]

</ul><p>

Although 77 percent of Americans favor the death penalty for murderers,
they don't want the system to act in undue haste and execute innocent
people who may have been wrongly convicted.[7] Thus, the courts and
legislative bodies have carefully crafted a system of checks and
balances which includes federal habeas corpus petitions. The system
has saved some innocent people from execution and from the effects
of judicial errors.

<p>

Lloyd Schlup was convicted and sentenced to death in 1985 for
helping to kill a fellow inmate in the Missouri State Penitentiary.
Schlup's jury didn't hear from the 20 prisoners who witnessed
the murder and who later testified that Schlup wasn't the killer.
Neither did they see a surveillance videotape that showed Schlup
elsewhere at the time of the murder. Finally, at the insistence
of Schlup's fifth court-appointed lawyer, the evidence was heard.
The federal judge, after seeing the evidence, said, &quot;No reasonable
juror would have convicted [Schlup] in light of the new evidence.&quot;[8]

<p>

Those opposed to habeas corpus reform such as the &quot;Emergency
Committee to Save Habeas Corpus&quot; often cite the case of Roger
Coleman. In 1981, Coleman was convicted and sentenced to death
for murdering and raping his sister-in-law although no one could
place him at the scene of the crime, and four independent witnesses
corroborated his near-perfect alibi. He was allegedly denied an
opportunity to present new evidence 10 years after sentencing
because his lawyer missed a filing date by three days. Coleman
was executed.[9]

<p>

The pro-reform Criminal Justice Legal Foundation (CJLF) provides
the rest of the story. Coleman's case went to the Supreme Court
twice on federal habeas corpus petitions. He claimed that new
evidence proved his innocence but in fact, according to a federal
judge, the forensic evidence done at Coleman's request &quot;significantly
bolster[ed] the jury's finding of guilt.&quot;[10]

<p>

Another case used to defend habeas corpus review involves Cornelius
Singleton, a black man, who was executed in Alabama in November,
1992, for murdering a nun in a cemetery by smothering her with
rocks. His court-appointed lawyer refused to meet with his client,
failed to object when the prosecutor struck all blacks from the
jury pool, and neglected to tell the jury that Singleton was mentally
retarded. The court-appointed attorney was disbarred. The attorney's
mistakes were wrong, but do not negate the facts in the case which
compelled a jury to find Singleton guilty of murder beyond a reasonable
doubt.[11]

<p>

<center><h3>HISTORY OF HABEAS CORPUS</h3></center>

<p>

Habeas corpus originated in Great Britain, where it was a 16th
century constitutional remedy against the tyranny of the crown.
It is found in Article 1, Section 9 of the U.S. Constitution:
&quot;The privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be
suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public
safety may require it.&quot; Only once has the writ been suspended.
In 1861, during the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln did so
by proclamation.

<p>

Traditionally habeas corpus was a pre-trial remedy which guarded
against federal oppression. The right to habeas corpus under the
constitution and the Judiciary Act of 1789 limited federal government
power but didn't apply to those detained by the states.[12] The Act
gave federal courts authority to issue the writ only for federal
prisoners. In 1833, Congress made an exception for state prisoners
in cases where states were interfering with federal officers enforcing
the Fugitive Slave Act.[13]

<p>

In 1867, Congress created an enlarged statutory habeas corpus.
The intent was to help former slaves held in involuntary servitude
in violation of the 13th Amendment. This change permitted any
prisoner convicted in a state court to have the constitutionality
of his conviction or his sentence reviewed by federal courts.[14]

<p>

This change was not frequently used. For example, in 1941, state
prisoners filed 127 petitions in federal courts.[15] But after the
creation of a &quot;quasi-appellate federal habeas corpus jurisdiction
by judicial decisions of the 1950s and 1960s&quot; the number
of petitions increased dramatically.[16] In 1994, state prisoners
filed 11,918 such petitions.[17]

<p>

The 1953 Supreme Court case of <I>Brown v. Allen</I> transformed
federal habeas corpus into a general appellate jurisdiction of
the lower federal courts over criminal judgments.[18] The Court eliminated
conventional limitations on the scope of habeas review by expanding
the federal rights of state defendants.

<p>

Under Chief Justice William Rehnquist, the Supreme Court has since
imposed some limitations on writs of habeas corpus. It has narrowed
the range of claims that can be raised by prisoners who have pled
guilty. It has also restricted claims that were not properly raised
before state courts and barred rehearing of 4th Amendment claims
where state proceedings provide a &quot;full and fair opportunity&quot;
to litigate such claims.[19]

<p>

In a 1989 decision, the high court said that federal courts can't
consider habeas claims based on &quot;new rules of law&quot; that
were not in effect at the time of conviction.[20] A 1991 decision
further limits death row prisoners to one federal habeas petition
unless there is good reason why any constitutional claim was not
raised in the first instance.[21]

<p>

<center><h3>PROFILE OF THOSE WHO USE HABEAS CORPUS</h3></center>

<p>

Most of the 13,359 federal and state inmates who filed federal
habeas corpus petitions in 1994 had been convicted of serious,
violent offenses. A 1987 U.S. Attorney General study found that
40 percent were filed five years after conviction, and delays
of more than 50 years were found.[22]

<p>

Anti-reform advocates like Yale Law School scholar Libby Lewis
cite myths to defend habeas corpus review. Lewis wrote in <I>The
Baltimore Sun</I>, &quot;Federal courts have found reversible
constitutional error in 40 percent of the death-penalty cases
reviewed under habeas corpus since 1976 -- after state courts
found no such error.&quot;[23]

<p>

A comprehensive analysis of federal habeas corpus reviews in capital
cases by the pro-reform CJLF labels Lewis's 40 percent statistic
&quot;out of date.&quot; The Foundation says the overall number
is around 15 percent, and for guilty verdicts the rate is only
5 percent.[24]

<p>

The Justice Department's 1995 review of federal habeas corpus
cases provides an interesting profile. It found that four of five
habeas petitioners had been convicted after trial and had their
cases reviewed by state appellate courts. Nearly half pursued
collateral remedies in state courts, and a third had filed at
least one previous federal petition.[25]

<p>

The Justice Department found that one-quarter of petitioners allege
ineffective assistance of counsel. Others cite trial court errors,
prosecutorial misconduct and violations of the 4th, 5th, 6th,
8th and 14th Amendments.[26] Roughly one-third of the petitions address
a single issue and more than 10 percent cite four or more issues.[27]

<p>

Federal courts dispose of most habeas cases quickly. Almost all
cases (98 percent) are either dismissed or denied on the merits,
while 1 percent are granted on the merits, leaving only 1 percent
to be returned to state courts for follow-up action.[28] Almost two-thirds
are dismissed due to either plaintiff's failure to exhaust state
remedies or procedural errors. Three of every four cases are settled
in about a year, but one out of every 10 cases lasts longer than
two years.[29]

<p>

Of course, the more issues involved, the longer the case. Multiple-issue
petitions average about 925 days to resolve while single-issue
cases are resolved in 224 days. The type of issue also dictates
the length of the period for resolution. For example, petitions
which allege prosecutorial misconduct take on the average 608
days, and trial court error issues take 559 days.[30]

<p>

On December 31, 1994, the Justice Department found there were
2,890 prisoners under sentence of death. During the period from
1977 to 1994, a total of 4,557 persons entered state and federal
prisons under sentences of death, and 1,790 of them have been
removed as a result of resentencing, retrial, commutation or death
while awaiting execution.[31]

<p>

In 1989, CJLF studied 100 capital habeas corpus cases from the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. It found that
40 percent of the court's final judgments resulted in relief.
Anti-reform advocates use this as evidence that habeas reviews
identify systemic deficiencies in state courts. But on closer
examination of each case, the states reached a reasonable decision.
The cases that gained federal relief came because the law had
changed, the claim was never properly presented to the state courts,
or because the courts simply disagreed with state jurists.[32]

<p>

A 1994 study by the National Center for State Courts came to a
similar conclusion. It found that the success rate for capital
habeas petitioners was &quot;vastly overstated.&quot; It found
that federal courts gave relief in 15 percent of capital cases
examined.[33]

<p>

<center><h3>WHY NOT CHANGE HABEAS CORPUS REVIEW?</h3></center>

<p>

Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote in 1992 that there
is no case in which &quot;a state court's incorrect legal determination
has ever been allowed to stand because it was reasonable. . .
. We have always held that federal courts, even on habeas, have
an independent obligation to say what the law is.&quot;[34]

<p>

Habeas provides a mechanism to protect a criminal's constitutional
rights from abusive state courts. In 1982, a police officer in
Houston, Texas was gunned down during a routine traffic stop.
Police killed one of the assailants and charged the other with
the officer's murder. A jury convicted the man and sentenced him
to death. Texas denied him a rehearing. The man, an illegal alien,
filed a habeas petition. The federal judge found that prosecutors
had threatened witnesses, failed to disclose evidence that showed
the man's innocence and used false evidence at trial. The man's
life was saved.[35]

<p>

Hugo Bedau, a professor at Tufts University and an authority on
the death penalty, defends habeas, saying, &quot;It's absolutely
critical if we're going to have a death penalty system that we
provide adequate safeguards lest we make an irreversible, catastrophic
mistake. And we know that mistakes are constantly made.&quot;[36]

<p>

Leigh Dingerson, with the National Coalition to Abolish the Death
Penalty, also defends habeas corpus petitions. The &quot;real&quot;
implication of the habeas reform effort, according to Dingerson,
is that &quot;we'll see cases with significant constitutional
error slide through the courts without review. . . . Most death
row inmates were very poorly represented by trial counsel. . .
. So the more we limit the appeals process, the more we risk executing
defendants simply because they had a lousy lawyer.&quot;[37]

<p>

&quot;Without a review process conducted by a federal judge sitting
for life,&quot; said Michael Knoll, head of the Death Penalty
Information Center, &quot;you are going to see a lot more errors
go through -- errors that will lead to executions.&quot;[38]

<p>

Those opposed to habeas reform explain that state judges, who
may be elected [this is true in seven of the 50 states], and who
sometimes are former prosecutors, are subject to local political
pressures which could influence their trial decisions. This is
why federal courts are run by judges who are appointed for life
and are immune to many of the same pressures.

<p>

Former Florida Supreme Court Chief Justice Arthur England supports
federal review of state decisions. &quot;We've had instances in
Florida where innocent people came very close to being executed,&quot;
but they were saved by federal review.[39]

<p>

Former president of the American Bar Association, John Curtin,
Jr., supports habeas review of state decisions. &quot;Miscarriages
of justice cannot be tolerated in a civilized society.&quot;[40] Habeas
review acts as a responsible check on the system.

<p>

<center><h3>WHY CHANGE HABEAS CORPUS REVIEW?</h3></center>

<p>

Jerri Davis, whose son was viciously murdered in 1979 by a killer
who has delayed his execution for 17 years, argues, &quot;As long
as he's sitting up there, there's resentment. He has his life.
He has his card games, his exercise, his TV. We're feeding him.
We're clothing him. It's not fair.&quot;[41]

<p>

Death-row inmates like the killer of Davis's son have manipulated
the courts. They have nothing to lose, and the taxpayer picks
up the tab. Even Justice O'Connor cautions federal courts to be
&quot;fair to the states, in not disrupting the states' enforcement
of their criminal laws.&quot;[42]

<p>

&quot;There are some crimes that are so brutal that society expects
and demands the death penalty,&quot; says Michael Capizzi, an
Orange County, California district attorney. &quot;If you take
a quick snapshot of the devastation to human beings you understand
why an overwhelming majority of the people in the state favor
the death penalty.&quot;[43]

<p>

An ABA report shows that even the simplest cases, where relief
is denied at every stage, will still go to the high court at least
three times and to federal district and appellate courts twice.
That's after all state-level options are exhausted.[44]

<p>

Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia has criticized the death
penalty appeals process. &quot;The state has, as noted, a strong
interest in executing its duly acquired judgment.&quot; Referring
to a convicted murderer who has delayed his execution via the
appeals process for 15 years, he says his &quot;interest . . .is
entirely indeterminate, and for all we know non-existent. He seeks
additional time not in order to elaborate on a known claim, but
in order to develop a claim.&quot; Judge Scalia fears that the
current process allows executions to be &quot;stayed 
indefinitely.&quot;[45]

<p>

Paul Kamenar, director of the Washington Legal Foundation, says
that reforming habeas corpus and the 1976 revival of the death
penalty will improve criminal justice. But he warns, &quot;The
deterrent effect of any punishment depends on how swiftly the
punishment is applied.&quot;[46] Given the long delays for appeals
between sentencing and execution, many citizens have grown disillusioned
with the justice system.

<p>

Rep. Bill McCollum (R-Fla.), chairman of the House Judiciary Crime
Subcommittee, wants to limit habeas corpus appeals. &quot;It sends
the message of swiftness and certainty of punishment that has
been missing from our criminal justice system for some time, and
it goes a long way to restoring deterrence to the criminal justice
system.&quot;[47]

<p>

Rep. Steve Chabot (R-Ohio) supports changing the appeals process
&quot;because of the length of time that people remain on death
row at taxpayer expense. The people in this country are sick and
tired of paying for cable TV and . . . for food and lawyers for
those who have killed innocent people.&quot;[48]

<p>

John Collins, with the Springfield, Va., Citizens for Law and
Order, expresses a widely held belief that &quot;with repeated
review, there's never any finality, and there is continued victimization
of families.&quot; He asked, &quot;If you have federal review
after you've had full and fair state court consideration, why
have the state courts at all?&quot;[49]

<p>

Reform advocates contend that death-row inmates intentionally
withhold claims and wait until the last minute to petition federal
courts to gain execution delays. William Kopney, an Orange County
appellate attorney, said, &quot;Don't underestimate the ingenuity
of the people who are struggling 24 hours a day to save someone's
life when they believe the trial wasn't fair, or there's a miscarriage
of justice . . . . It's common for 11th-hour requests to strike
some responsive chord.&quot;[50]

<p>

<center><h3>LEGISLATION TO REFORM HABEAS CORPUS</h3></center>

<p>

Many Americans want Congress to do something to reverse what they
perceive to be the abuse of the justice system by inmates. Americans
are also cynical about a liberal judiciary that appears to place
criminals' rights before victims' rights.

<p>

That's the impetus for legislative action to curb habeas corpus
abuse. In 1983, then-Attorney General William French Smith suggested
enactment of legislation abolishing federal habeas corpus as a
post-conviction remedy for state inmates.[51] Although Attorney General
Edwin Meese III agreed, Congress failed to act.[52] More recent attorneys
general echo agreement.

<p>

Following the April, 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, President Clinton
called for &quot;swift justice&quot; and gave his support to an
anti-terrorism bill. In both the Senate and House versions, that
bill includes habeas corpus reform.

<p>

The Senate version (S. 735, &quot;Comprehensive Terrorism Act
of 1995&quot;) requires that a prisoner show that his conviction
or sentence violated &quot;clearly established federal law, as
determined by the Supreme Court of the U.S.&quot;[53]

<p>

The House version (H.R. 2703, &quot;The Effective Death Penalty
and Public Safety Act&quot;) incorporates habeas corpus reform
that establishes a six-month statute of limitations during which
a prisoner must file paperwork to receive an appeal hearing in
capital offense cases. Non-capital defendants have one year in
which to file appeal paperwork. Once the appeal has been filed,
the federal court must hear the case within four months. If the
petitioner loses at the district court, he may appeal only if:
(1) newly discovered evidence demonstrates clearly and convincingly
that no reasonable fact-finder would have found the defendant
guilty in his original trial, and (2) a new rule of constitutional
law, made retroactive by the Supreme Court, is issued which was
previously unavailable.

<p>

Officials at the Office of Management and Budget criticize the
proposed changes. In their view, the proposed reform will &quot;subject
[the law] to potentially meritorious constitutional challenge.&quot;[54]
OMB says the proposal presumes to instruct federal courts on the
decisions those courts should reach on the meaning of the Constitution.

<p>

<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>

<p>

The battle over habeas corpus reform will become a constitutional
confrontation between the judiciary and the legislature. Congress
can make law, but the high court has sway over issues of constitutionality.

<p>

The issue of protracted appeals by convicted criminals touches
deep emotions, especially among victims and their families. It
costs taxpayers millions of dollars to support inmate litigation
and sustain the judicial system. While appeals are in process
the friends and family of the victims suffer because they believe
justice has not been served. After almost every execution, the
victim's family says something to the effect of, &quot;At least
I can rest. Justice has been served.&quot;

<p>

It's time for habeas corpus reform that balances constitutional
rights and ensures justice. Any change must equally address three
tenets: swift punishment means better deterrence; limitless and
meritless appeals deny justice and displace taxpayer funds from
other programs; and hasty punishment may result in injustice to
those wrongly convicted.

<p>

Americans want to protect civil liberties, but they also want
to avoid freeing violent criminals on technicalities while ensuring
that police officers do not abuse their authority. Striking
this delicate balance is the subject of a national debate that
centers on the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution.

<p>

The Fourth Amendment guarantees &quot;[t]he right of the people
to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects, against
unreasonable searches and seizures[.]&quot;  To protect this right,
the modern judiciary created the exclusionary rule, which says
that prosecutors may not use evidence gathered illegally by the
police.  The rule is intended to keep law enforcement honest.

<p>

Policemen must obtain a warrant prior to searching and seizing.
Otherwise, evidence obtained at a crime scene may be ruled inadmissible
in court.  Judges routinely exclude such &quot;illegally&quot;
obtained evidence and allow criminals to go free. For example:

<p><ul>

<li>Charles Rathbun was arrested for the November 1995 murder
of model Linda Sobek.  He allegedly took Sobek into the California
hills, where he murdered her and buried her body.  During questioning,
Rathbun confessed to the crime and led officials to Sobek's grave.
A California court, however, ruled Rathbun's confession inadmissible
because police had not read him his rights prior to questioning.[1]
He may go free.

<p>

<li>Gary Gauger confessed to the gruesome murder of his parents
in 1993.  He was convicted and sentenced to death.  On appeal,
an Illinois court ruled that his confession was inadmissible because
it, too, was illegally obtained.[2] He may go free.

<p>

<li>In 1984, Alfio Ferro was arrested for a fur robbery and murder.
While in custody, Ferro refused to speak with police.  One of
the detectives laid some furs in front of Ferro's cell.  Ferro,
thinking the police had information about the crime, made statements
which were later used against him.  A New York appeals court overturned
his murder conviction, contending that the placing of furs in
front of Ferro's cell amounted to coercion.  Ferro was freed.[3]

</ul><p>

Pending legislation which will alter the exclusionary rule might
have kept these murderers behind bars.

<p>

<center><h3>GROWING NATIONAL INTOLERANCE FOR LEGAL ABUSES</h3></center>

<p>

According to Steven Wagner of Luntz Research, a Republican polling
firm, there is a widespread feeling that the criminal justice
system has broken down and that the breakdown is &quot;the most
visible symbol of the declining moral character of American 
society.&quot;[4] Consider evidence of a wayward justice system.

<p>

In January 1996, at 5 a.m., a New York police officer patrolling
a high-crime area saw four young men loading duffel bags into
the trunk of an out-of-state car.  The men fled when they saw
the officer.  The officer found $4 million worth of cocaine and
heroin in the bags.[5]

<p>

Initially, federal District Court Judge Harold Baer found the
officer's explanation &quot;incredible&quot; and threw out the
trafficker's videotaped confession, saying the arrested driver
could have been an innocent visitor getting help with her luggage.[6]
He denied that the police had &quot;probable cause&quot; for
searching the car.  The judge also said the men fled because of
the police department's reputation for being brutal.  Only after
a buildup of political pressure (including from President Clinton,
who had appointed the judge) did Baer reverse the finding.[7]

<p>

House Speaker Newt Gingrich called on President Clinton to admit
he had made mistakes in appointing judges &quot;who find technicalities
to release drug dealers and dangerous criminals.&quot;[8] Others
accused Baer of favoring the rights of criminals over public safety.

<p>

Nevertheless, it is not difficult to see why some Americans are
suspicious of law enforcement.  Tales of police corruption, rogue
cops and evidence &quot;planting&quot; fill the media.  Testimony
in the O.J. Simpson murder trial by former Los Angeles detective
Mark Fuhrman eroded confidence in all policemen.  Fuhrman gave
the country a startling example of police brutality and racism.
Fuhrman bragged on tape about police abuses:  &quot;We basically
tortured them. . . .We broke'em.  Their faces were just mush.&quot;[9]

<p>

The widely-publicized Rodney King beating and the recent videotape
of two white deputies clubbing Mexicans near Los Angeles have
revived fears of rogue cops.  The &quot;Good Ol' Boys Roundup&quot;
in eastern Tennessee, where law enforcement agents took part in
racist acts, also add to the public's negative perception of law
enforcement.

<p>

Although these scenes do not represent the hundreds of thousands
of law enforcement officers who do their job well and faithfully
every day, they have undermined public confidence in the justice
and law enforcement systems and have chilled the exclusionary
rule debate.  Americans are confused about calls to reform the
rule.  Should lawmakers leave the rule alone or give police more
authority? Both options have liabilities.

<p>

<center><h3>THE EXCLUSIONARY RULE IN HISTORY</h3></center>

<p>

The exclusionary rule was created by the courts to implement the
Fourth Amendment.  It dates back to colonial times when British
troops broke down doors of homes seeking criminal evidence.  The
framers of America's Bill of Rights had one specific incident
in mind.

<p>

The 1763 case of <I>Wilkes v. Wood</I> clearly illustrates the
need for the Fourth Amendment. British troops, acting without
a warrant, broke into Wilkes' home and seized his private diaries.
Wilkes won his damage action against the colonial government.
His case steeled the Constitution's framers with a desire to
preclude future abuses.

<p>

Although the Fourth Amendment of the Bill of Rights guarantees
to all persons the right to be secure from &quot;unreasonable&quot;
searches and seizures, it does not specify a remedy for violations
of this protection.  This is where the Supreme Court has sought
clarity.

<p>

In the 1820s, an attorney argued before the high court that the
Constitution provided for the exclusion of evidence.  Supreme
Court Justice Joseph Story denied that the Bill of Rights included
the concept of excluding evidence.  Story wrote, &quot;The right
of using evidence does not depend, nor, as far as I have any recollection,
has ever been supposed to depend, upon the lawfulness or unlawfulness
of the mode by which it is obtained.&quot;[10]

<p>

In 1886, however, the high court took the first steps toward creating
the modern exclusionary rule.  In <I>Boyd v. United States</I>,
the Supreme Court decided that using a man's diary or personal
papers as evidence against him in a criminal case would force
him &quot;to be a witness against himself.&quot;[11] Under these
circumstances, the court opined, the use of such evidence could
be denied.

<p>

In 1914, the exclusionary rule was officially created by the <I>Weeks
v. United States</I> decision. The high court determined that
evidence seized illegally had to be excluded.   The court reasoned
that the temptation to make unlawful searches and seizures could
not be checked by the threat of a civil lawsuit alone, and that
forcing law enforcement officials to get proper warrants would
force them to act with restraint. The court also reasoned that
denying police the fruits of unrestrained searches was an appropriate
defense of civil liberties.

<p>

As in the 1949 <I>Wolf v. Colorado</I> case, the high court resisted
forcing the rule on state courts. But in 1961, Chief Justice
Earl Warren led the Supreme Court in <I>Mapp v. Ohio</I> to expand
the rule's application to all jurisdictions.  In 1984, it was
modified with <I>Leon v. United States</I>. In this case police
conducted a search pursuant to a search warrant that later was
found to have been defective.  The Supreme Court said that because
the officers believed they were acting properly, denying the evidence
would not deter future misconduct.  This has become known as the
&quot;good-faith&quot; exception.

<p>

The &quot;good-faith&quot; exception has also been applied in
situations where police gathered evidence without a search warrant
but in the reasonable belief that their actions were proper.

<p>

Now that the exclusionary rule has been tried for 80 years, it
has earned both supporters and detractors.  Professor William
Gangi of St. John's University told the Senate Judiciary Committee,
&quot;I see Americans growing increasingly cynical about our criminal
justice system, making derogatory references to 'technicalities'
or to criminals having more rights than their victims. And we
have to ask ourselves, 'Why?'&quot;[12]

<p>

<center><h3>HANDS-OFF THE RULE</h3></center>

<p>

Defenders of the exclusionary rule claim it keeps lawmen honest.

<p>

Alan Dershowtiz, Harvard law professor and civil liberties advocate,
cautions that expanding the defendant's rights using the exclusionary
rule is the best way to protect the public from police abuses.[13]

<p>

James Fyfe, a former New York policeman and specialist on police
behavior, warns that &quot;...like some soldiers in a no-win war,
they [policemen] commit atrocities.&quot;[14]

<p>

This warning is not without substance.  The 1994 New York City
Mollen Commission investigated police corruption.  It found the
Department plagued with misconduct.  The Commission also found
that the Department's internal affairs &quot;often minimized and
even concealed corruption rather than rooted it out.&quot;  In
March 1994, 50 cops were arrested on charges of drug trafficking,
extortion, brutality and civil rights violations.[15]

<p>

Recently, Philadelphia had a similar police scandal.  Six rogue
cops pleaded guilty to charges that they framed people, lied to
obtain search warrants and stole money.  At least 42 criminal
convictions have been overturned as a result of these disclosures.[16]

<p>

Some key members of Congress support the exclusionary rule as
a check on police corruption.  On March 7, 1995, Senator Edward
Kennedy (D-Mass.) told the Senate Judiciary Committee, &quot;The
exclusionary rule enforces the Fourth Amendment by providing a
powerful disincentive to illegal searches by law enforcement
officials. . . .The rule has given prosecutors' offices and police
departments an institutional stake in thorough, lawful police
work.&quot;[17] Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Colo.) and Rep. Bobby
Rush (D-Ill.) both claim to have been victimized by warrantless
federal searches.[18]

<p>

The American Bar Association also supports the rule.  Michael
McCann, an elected district attorney of Milwaukee County, Wisconsin,
spoke for the ABA at the same Senate Judiciary crime control hearing.
&quot;The rule has worked. . . .It has contributed to substantial
law reform by federal authorities.  It has increased the professionalism
of federal law enforcement officers.  It has vastly enhanced the
integrity of the federal judicial process.&quot;[19]

<p>

Rule supporters point out that complaints of abuse are often unfounded.
They cite four studies that show that the rule is seldom used
to toss out evidence.  A 1979 General Accounting Office report
found that motions to suppress evidence were granted in only 1.3
percent of federal cases.  A 1982 National Institute of Justice
study found that only 0.79 percent of all California felony cases
between 1976-79 rejected evidence because of the rule.  A study
of three midwestern states found the rule was used in less than
half of 1 percent of all cases.  Finally, Professor Wayne LaFave of the
University of Illinois College of Law found, &quot;The most careful
and balanced assessment of all available empirical data show [sic]
that. . .the cumulative loss in felony cases because of prosecutor
screening, police releases and court dismissals attributable to
the acquisition of evidence in violation of the Fourth Amendment
is from 0.6 percent to 2.35 percent.&quot;[20]

<p>

Even some peace officers support the rule.  Myron Orfield Jr.,
writing in the <I>University of Chicago Law Review</I>, quotes
the head of the narcotics section of the Organized Crime Division
of the Chicago Police Department:  &quot;In my personal opinion
[the exclusionary rule] is not a detriment to police work.  In
fact, the opposite is true.  It makes the police department more
professional.&quot;[21]

<p>

FBI director Louis Freeh said, &quot;My sense and my experience
have been that over the years, the exclusionary rule has not been
an obstacle to the FBI.&quot;[22]

<p>

John Dawes, a Cobb County, Georgia, homicide detective said, &quot;It's
been my experience that it's better to have a legal search warrant
issued by a judge.  That way, when you're entering, you know that
you're legally entering and legally gathering evidence.&quot;[23]

<p>

Justice Louis Brandeis endorsed placing constraints on law enforcers.
He wrote for the high court in the 1928 case <I>Olmstead v. United
States</I>: &quot;Our government is the potent, the omnipresent
teacher.  For good or for ill, it teaches the whole people by
its example. . . .If the government becomes a lawbreaker, it breeds
contempt for law; it invites every man to become a law unto himself;
it invites anarchy.&quot;[24]

<p>

Harvard law professor Carol Steiker echoed Brandeis's views to
the Senate Judiciary Committee at the March 7, 1995 hearing. 
She traced the expansion in the size and strength of our modern
police forces and said, &quot;Today's citizens are much more likely
to face well-trained and well-equipped police than they are to
encounter the anonymous blundering constable [who was once blamed
for making illegal searches]. . . .&quot;  She argues that modern
police are &quot;measured not by fidelity to procedural niceties
but rather by their ability to ferret out as much crime as possible.
In this respect, the Fourth Amendment's warrant clause and the
exclusionary rule are eminently realistic constitutional commands:
each counterbalances the natural incentive to fight crime at
any cost.&quot;[25]

<p>

She cited Justice Brandeis: &quot;To declare that in the administration
of the criminal law the end justifies the means -- to declare
that the government would commit crimes in order to secure the
conviction of a private criminal -- would bring terrible 
retribution.&quot;[26]

<p>

Steiker says the exclusionary rule protects the most vulnerable
citizens from police over-reaching.  Specifically, she contends,
racial minorities are discriminated against by law enforcement
because too often race and class act as proxies for criminality
and too often police subject minority communities to the most
intrusive and offensive law enforcement tactics.[27]

<p>

She further argues that the rule encourages prosecutors and law
enforcement to communicate during the early stages of investigations
so as to develop evidence that can be used in court. Finally,
Steiker believes it protects the judicial process by preventing
government from being implicated in legitimizing unlawful conduct.[28]

<p>

<center><h3>CHANGE THE EXCLUSIONARY RULE</h3></center>

<p>

On the other hand, Senator Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), chairman of the
Senate Judiciary Committee, disputes the notion that the exclusionary
rule deters police misconduct.  He argues that there is &quot;little
reliable empirical evidence that police misconduct has been deterred
by the rule.&quot;[29]

<p>

Judge Harold Rothwax, former vice chairman of the New York Civil
Liberties Union during the 1960s says, &quot;The pendulum has
now swung to the point that it unfairly favors the defendant 
[criminal].&quot;[30]

<p>

Judge Rothwax warns, &quot;What's happened is we've really departed
from common sense. . . . The system today seems incomprehensible to 
the average citizen.&quot;[31]

<p>

Steven Brill, editor-in-chief of <I>Court TV</I> and <I>The American
Lawyer</I>, agrees. &quot;There's no doubt that lots and lots
of people of good faith -- who aren't anti-civil liberties and
aren't right-wing zealots -- are increasingly frustrated.&quot;[32]

<p>

Professor Gangi told the Senate Judiciary Committee, &quot;I call
it a disgrace.  Not only has the exclusionary rule failed to work
the magic its proponents promised, but it has eroded citizen confidence
in the competency of government.  And, in my opinion, it also
has thoroughly undermined the nobility of the role once played
by defense counsel.&quot;[33]

<p>

Paul Robinson, a professor at Northwestern University School of
Law, writes in <I>The Atlantic Monthly</I>, &quot;The exclusionary
rule...suggests a system less strongly committed to doing justice
than to discouraging overreaching by the police.&quot;  He suggests
that police misconduct can be controlled by making offending officers
liable or by helping victims to get compensation from municipalities.
He says, &quot;If limiting overreaching by the police is such
an important goal, why not attack it head-on rather than 'punishing'
the offending officers by letting the criminal go free -- which
punishes society rather than the officers?&quot;[34]

<p>

<center><h3>PENDING LEGISLATION WOULD CHANGE THE RULE</h3></center>

<p>

The Exclusionary Rule Reform Act of 1995 (H.R. 666) would expand
the so-called &quot;good-faith&quot; exception to certain federal
searches without a warrant.  Evidence would be admissible as long
as trial judges determine that police had reason to believe that
their actions were proper.  The bill would not overturn prior
Supreme Court decisions specifying when a warrant must be obtained
prior to conducting a search.

<p>

Professor Steiker admits that this bill would not eliminate the
exclusionary rule but proposes it would admit unconstitutionally
seized evidence when law enforcement agents have a belief in the
legitimacy of their conduct.  She argues that this change ignores
the importance of the rule in the maintenance of judicial integrity
and fails to provide equally effective deterrence of unconstitutional
conduct. Further, she believes it will encourage police overreaching.[35]

<p>

Thomas Davies, professor at the University of Tennessee College
of Law, agrees with Steiker.  He believes H.R. 666 would provide
short-term gains, &quot;but the rule plays a vital role in reaffirming
the rule of law.  [The exclusionary rule and Mirander Waiver rules]
tell police officers that citizen's rights matter.  They allow
honest police officers to respect themselves as upstanding citizens
also.&quot;[36]

<p>

Senator Hatch's legislation, The Violent Crime Control and Law
Enforcement Improvement Act of 1995 (S.3), would eliminate the
rule entirely and establish in its place a civil tort remedy designed
to benefit citizens whose Fourth Amendment rights have been violated.

<p>

Hatch argues, the &quot;rule is not compelled by the Constitution.
. . .It is time to revisit this judicially-created remedy.&quot;[37]
He wants to strike the delicate balance between protecting the
rights of the accused from police misconduct while ensuring that
relevant evidence comes before the jury -- so as to put the truly
guilty in jail and achieve justice.
Akhil Reed Amar, a professor at Yale Law School, told the Senate
Judiciary Committee  that the Hatch bill &quot;restores coherence
to our constitutional structure.  It takes the Fourth Amendment
out of criminal procedure, where it does not fit, and puts it
back where it belongs: in constitutional law.&quot;[38] He also
said, &quot;Suppose the bill increases convictions of guilty defendants
by 1 percent.  That's a lot of guilty rapists, murderers, and
robbers, and a lot of victims of crime who can sleep easier.&quot;[39]

<p>

The Hatch bill is not without its opponents.  Senator Kennedy
said that enactment of the Hatch bill &quot;would invite drastically
reduced compliance with the Constitution.&quot;[40]

<p>

Professor Steiker believes that removing the rule would fail to
provide the required deterrent effect and that the tort alternative
is misdirected.  Victims of illegal searches would not bring suit
against police misconduct either because lawyers would be reluctant
to take such cases or the likely awards would be insufficiently
enticing.[41]

<p>

<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>

<p>

There are competing concepts in the exclusionary rule debate 
-- freedom from police misconduct and justice for the guilty.
We must find a balance.

<p>

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. wrote from his Birmingham, Alabama
jail cell, &quot;Freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor,
it must be demanded by the oppressed.&quot;[42] Most citizens would
agree with Dr. King.

<p>

Today, there is ample evidence that some lawmen and judges are
over-stepping their bounds.  This must change.  Congress should
modify the law to simultaneously deny freedom to the guilty, give
incentives for police professionalism and protect civil liberties.
It can start by changing the court-created exclusionary rule.

MEDICINAL USES</h2>

<p>

If a bill before the House makes its way into law, the federal
government would have to make the switch from uprooting and destroying
marijuana crops to growing its own fields of plants for large-scale
distribution.

<p>

Once again, pro-drug groups are trying to convince America that
marijuana must be considered a legitimate medicine. Rep. Barney
Frank (D-Mass.) introduced H.R. 2618 last November, which would
&quot;provide for the therapeutic use of marijuana in situations
involving life-threatening or sense-threatening illnesses and
to provide adequate supplies of marijuana for such use.&quot;[1]

<p>

The specified illnesses are to be limited to glaucoma, AIDS wasting
syndrome, nausea resulting from chemotherapy, and spasticity resulting
from multiple sclerosis (MS), paraplegia, and quadriplegia. However,
the bill does leave room for those with other illnesses to apply
for marijuana use through the Food and Drug Administration.[2]

<p>

Basically, the bill is another effort to reclassify marijuana.
Currently, marijuana is under Schedule I, meaning it is unable
to be prescribed, has a high potential for abuse, is not currently
accepted for medicinal use, and has a lack of safety. Rescheduling
marijuana would place it under Schedule II, which includes drugs
currently accepted for medical use that have a high potential
for abuse, but are still able to be prescribed.[3] Cocaine is an
example of a Schedule II drug.

<p>

The bill calls for an Office for the Supply of Internationally
Controlled Drugs to be established under the Department of Health
and Human Services. That office would be responsible for making
sure there is an adequate supply of the drug for &quot;legitimate
medical, research, scientific, and export needs of the United
States.&quot; This supply would come from bidders or, if there
weren't enough domestic growers, from direct importation.

<p>

The office would provide the seeds to those whose bids to grow
marijuana are accepted. Those seeds, in turn, would be obtained
as follows: &quot;[L]egitimate commercial producers of marijuana
or, if this is not feasible, the National Institute on Drug Abuse,
the Attorney General through the Drug Enforcement Administration,
or the Secretary of Agriculture shall provide the Secretary with
an adequate supply of seeds capable of germination.&quot;

<p>

The marijuana would be distributed to doctors who have said they
intend to use the drug only on consenting patients with one of
the aforementioned illnesses. The doctors would be approved by
sending in applications which the office would approve or deny
within 30 days. According to the bill, if the office does not
respond within that time, doctors could consider themselves approved.

<p>

The use of marijuana as medicine has stirred considerable controversy.
Marijuana advocates insist it carries valuable medical benefits
and claim it is actually more harmful to prohibit the sick from
smoking it. Most of the medical community sees it differently,
however. Few doubt that marijuana (cannabis) does have a certain
degree of medical effect. The problem is the marked disadvantages
crude marijuana carries with it. Smoked marijuana has too many
negative side-effects to warrant its use as a drug.

<p>

Of course, the utility of marijuana as a true medicine too often
takes a back seat to other interests. The pro-marijuana movement,
led by the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws
(NORML) and the Drug Policy Foundation (DPF), certainly has a
well-known ulterior motive for pushing marijuana as a medicine.
Dr. Janet Lapey, a pathologist who is now president of Concerned
Citizens for Drug Prevention, said members of NORML have frequently
cited the medicinal marijuana issue as a red herring to gain a
toehold in legalizing all marijuana use.[4] (In fact, the pro-drug
<I>High Times</I> magazine characterized drug proposals like 
marijuana-as-medicine as being mere first steps that were &quot;far 
short of the DPF's ultimate goals, which include decriminalization of 
all illegal drugs.&quot;[5])

<p>

Marijuana simply is not the equal of other therapeutic drugs already
on the market. In fact, the American Medical Association, the
American Glaucoma Society, the American Academy of Ophthalmology,
the American Cancer Society, and the National Multiple Sclerosis
Society all deny that marijuana should be construed as medicine.[6]
After the DEA reviewed a petition for the possible rescheduling
of marijuana, Robert Bonner, the Administrator of Drug Enforcement
at the time, wrote, &quot;Relying on the same scientific standards
used to judge all other drugs, FDA experts repeatedly have rejected
marijuana for medical use.&quot;[7]

<p>

The active medical and psychoactive ingredient in marijuana is
delta-nine tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). A synthetic THC called
dronabinol has been marketed as the drug Marinol since 1985.[8] Thus,
what medical good there is in marijuana has already been separated
from the problematic vegetable tissue of the cannabis plant. However,
even this purified and tested drug is not well received because
of its serious side-effects. Dr. Eric A.Voth is an assistant professor
of medicine at the University of Kansas and chairman of the International
Drug Strategy Institute. He has treated drug addicts for 10 years,
and recently testified at a congressional hearing on the legalization
of marijuana. Voth asserts, &quot;The negative side-effect profile
for marijuana, even dronabinol (Marinol), far exceeds most of
the other effective agents available.&quot;[9] Voth backs this assertion
by citing a study which ranked non-inhalant THC as only sixth
in preference among oncologists for the treatment of severe nausea,
and only ninth for mild nausea.[10]

<p>

Crude marijuana has even less to recommend it. First, no approved
drug is smoked. In the same way that tobacco is known to induce
lung cancer, smoking marijuana increases chances of cancer, too.
Billy Martin, a professor at the Virginia Commonwealth University's
medical college, said, &quot;There is good scientific evidence
showing adverse effects of smoking marijuana. Certainly it has
much higher tar content than cigarettes.&quot;[11] One study found
that marijuana smoking resulted in up to four times the respiratory
burden of an equivalent amount of tobacco smoking.[12] A September,
1993, National Institute on Drug Abuse update reported, &quot;Daily
use of one to three marijuana joints appears to produce approximately
the same lung damage and potential cancer risk as smoking five
times as many cigarettes.&quot;[13]

<p>

When marijuana supporters advocate smoking the drug for the rest
of a patient's life (for conditions like MS or glaucoma), it seems
strange to promote a &quot;treatment&quot; that could very well
promote disease and hasten death. Moreover, at a time when tobacco
products are roundly criticized, legalizing a similar product
for supposedly medicinal purposes would be hypocritical.

<p>

Besides the adverse effects of smoking, marijuana use is related
to amotivation syndrome in chronic users, characterized by a loss
of energy, general apathy, and impairment of concentration. Sedation
and lethargy are very common. Acute negative psychological effects
could include flashbacks, panic attacks, and disorientation.[14]

<p>

Additionally, for each of the diseases listed in Frank's bill,
scientific studies and the vast majority of doctors cast doubts
on marijuana's usefulness compared to currently approved drugs.

<p>

Simply put, glaucoma is gradual blindness caused when fluid pressure
inside the eye (intraocular pressure) is too high. Crude marijuana,
like alcohol ingestion, can reduce that pressure. But to arrest
glaucoma's progress, marijuana would have to be ingested chronically
-- every day of a patient's life -- in order to be effective.
On the topic of glaucoma, a 1994 Drug Enforcement Administration
manual cited Dr. Keith Green. Green has served on the boards of
eight ophthalmological journals, and performed extensive research
on the relationship between marijuana and glaucoma. According
to the manual, Dr. Green &quot;suggests that in order to decrease
intraocular pressure, one would have to smoke the equivalent of
six joints a day.&quot;[15]

<p>

In studies analyzing the effect of marijuana on glaucoma, heavy
doses were needed to reach the point at which intraocular pressure
was reduced. In some studies, the effect of the necessary dosage
of marijuana caused patients to become quite drowsy. Researchers
reported, &quot;Our subjects were sometimes too sleepy to permit
measurement of intraocular pressures. . . three hours after 
intoxication.&quot;[16]

<p>

A 1994 Drug Watch publication entitled, &quot;Glaucoma: Is Marijuana
a Safe and Effective Treatment?&quot; reported that &quot;the
country's leading ophthalmologists are 'chagrined' and 'disturbed'
to hear that claims are being made touting marijuana as a treatment
for glaucoma.&quot;[17]

<p>

Vomiting because of chemotherapy treatment is a serious concern
of cancer patients and their doctors. While smoked marijuana has
some ability to control vomiting, doctors still say it is not
as effective as other, safer drugs. In an overview of antiemetic
(anti-vomiting) drugs in the <I>New England Journal of Medicine</I>,
the authors addressed cannabis derivatives that were used as antiemetics.
Dronabinol usage entailed serious side-effects, including &quot;dysphoria,
hallucinations, sedation, vertigo, dry mouth, and disorientation,
and are therefore seldom used as first-line antiemetic therapy.&quot;
The authors do find hope in cannabinoids, though: &quot;Synthetic
cannabinoids with no psychotropic activity have antiemetic 
activity.&quot;[18] Thus, cannabinoids could lead to anti-vomiting drugs 
in the future that don't have the mindbending effects that marijuana and 
its active ingredients have. This does not mean, of course, that crude
marijuana is that hope. Scientific studies have shown that marijuana
is not preferable to Marinol, which is itself not preferable to
other anti-vomiting drugs.[19]

<p>

Neither should marijuana be used as a treatment for spasticity
resulting from neurological disorders. The DEA manual, written
by Tom Pool, claimed, &quot;Experts on MS absolutely reject this
proposition.&quot;[20] Pool quotes Dr. Donald Silberberg, the Chair
of the Department of Neurology at the University of Pennsylvania
School of Medicine: &quot;The use of (marijuana), especially for
long-term treatment. . . would be worse than the original disease
itself.&quot;[21]

<p>

Of course, some MS sufferers adamantly claim marijuana helps control
their spasticity. These subjective anecdotes, unfortunately, have
not been borne out in clinical studies. One recent study indicated
that even while MS patients thought they were being helped by
smoking marijuana, their actual balance and coordination were
made worse.[22]

<p>

Using marijuana for treating AIDS patients brings more concerns.

<p>

Pool wrote, &quot;First, studies conducted at the Virginia Medical
College suggest that the THC in marijuana damages the immune system,
making the patient more susceptible to colds, viruses, and influenza
while at the same time increasing the severity of any illnesses
that the patient has. Clearly, the last thing that a patient with
AIDS needs is to have his or her immune system weakened. Second,
the marijuana smoke itself is damaging to the AIDS patients.&quot;[23]

<p>

Advocates of medicinal marijuana continually make claims that
might lead the unsuspecting to believe that marijuana is actually
a miracle drug. For example, one pamphlet published by the Colorado
Hemp Initiative Project stated, &quot;Cannabis is two to three
times as effective as are currently legal medicines for reducing
Intra-Ocular Pressure, without toxic side-effects or damage to
liver and kidneys associated with presently approved drugs.&quot;[24]
Yet, in an evaluation of glaucoma treatment published in the <I>New
England Journal of Medicine</I>, marijuana isn't even mentioned
-- odd, if it is indeed two to three times as effective as any
other drug.[25]

<p>

Voth summarized the issue by noting, &quot;The pro-drug lobby
would have the public and policy makers incorrectly believe that
crude marijuana is the only treatment alternative for masses of
cancer sufferers who are going untreated for the nausea associated
with chemotherapy, glaucoma, multiple sclerosis, and other 
ailments.&quot;[26]

<p>

Pro-marijuana arguments heavily rely on anecdotal evidence instead
of controlled studies. Many people make the claim that marijuana
use has helped control aspects of various diseases. However, anecdotes
are notoriously inaccurate or statistically misleading.

<p>

Robert Peterson, the director of Michigan's Office of Drug Control
Policy from 1991-1995, wrote, &quot;One must look closely at anecdotal
evidence. In some of the most celebrated cases, the individual
smoked pot before he or she ever got ill. Marijuana is addictive
and addicts tend to feel better when they receive their drug.
. . . There is no doubt that using a euphoric drug such as marijuana,
alcohol, cocaine or heroin will make a sick person feel better.
That does not make a drug a medicine.&quot;[27]

<p>

The DEA petition echoes Peterson. &quot;Sick people are not objective
scientific observers, especially when it comes to their own health.
We all have heard of the placebo effect. Patients have a tendency
to respond to drugs as they believe is expected of them. . . Stories
of marijuana's benefits from sick people with a prior history
of marijuana abuse may be based on rationalizations caused by
drug dependence, not on any medical benefits caused by the drug.&quot;[28]

<p>

Legislators considering legalizing marijuana as a type of folk
medicine should also consider the secondary effects of that action.
Past experience has shown that it is not uncommon for drugs distributed
by doctors that are otherwise illegal to spread from the patient
to his or her acquaintances and friends. Also, public attitudes
toward marijuana as a recreational drug probably would begin to
change if medicinal uses were approved. Already, youth are beginning
to see marijuana as a benign or even beneficial drug due to some
highly successful propaganda by groups like NORML. If, as the
evidence suggests, marijuana will not add anything to the American
medicine cabinet, any increased collateral use and resulting damage
would have to be added to the cost of rescheduling crude marijuana.

<p>

Certainly, pro-marijuana groups have performed admirably in disseminating
their views. Now, the voices of the objective medical establishment
need to match their enthusiasm, and inform the public of the truth
about medicinal uses of marijuana and the motivations behind the
arguments.

<p>

A 1995 government-commissioned study claims that giving clean
needles to addicts will slow the spread of the AIDS virus without
encouraging drug abuse. While there is reason to question this
claim, even if the spread of HIV among intravenous drug users
(IDU) were slowed, this action would create some potentially undesirable
effects.

<p>

The fight to establish federally-funded needle exchange programs
(NEP) is being urged as a wedge issue to gain drug legalization.
Linking drug addiction with the emotion-charged AIDS epidemic
under the pro-drug umbrella called &quot;harm reduction&quot;
is good political strategy, but it's a bad idea that is gathering
momentum, and it must be countered.

<p>

Supporters of federally-funded NEPs are rallying around this issue.
Leading NEP researcher Peter Lurie, a professor with the Institute
for Health Policy Studies, University of California San Francisco,
says the 1995 study is &quot;a vindication for all of the needle
exchange workers around the country, as well as the scientists
who have been coming to these conclusions for years....[The government]
can no longer hide from the weight of scientific evidence....&quot;[1]

<p>

In response to the American needle study, the respected British
medical journal <I>Lancet</I> said, &quot;It is time for the U.S.
to catch up with so much of the world....Needle exchanges do not
increase drug use in programme [sic] participants. They do not
encourage or increase the number of drug users. They do not increase
the number of needles lying about; they do not destroy cities,
or towns or neighborhoods.&quot;[2]

<p>

Dr. Lincoln Moses, chairman of the 15-member panel that led the
government's NEP study, said, &quot;We must consider the reality
that people do use drugs and that HIV is transmitted in growing
numbers by injection drug use.&quot;[3]

<p>

Not everyone agrees with those who favor needle exchange. Donna
Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), has
doubts. Shalala told <I>CNN</I> that &quot;different experts disagree&quot;
as to the efficacy of needle exchange.[4] Philip Lee, Shalala's assistant and 
a former needle exchange researcher, called NEPs &quot;an extraordinarily
complex public policy strategy&quot;[5] and expressed concern that
NEPs &quot;may send a mixed message about drug use.&quot;[6]

<p>

Roman Catholic Cardinal John O'Connor said, &quot;It [needle exchange]
drags down the standards of all society.... It is an act born
of desperation.&quot;[7] Reverend Calvin Butts, pastor of the Abyssinian
Baptist Church in Harlem, agrees. &quot;I am not in favor of cooperating
with evil,&quot; said Butts. &quot;If we give out needles now...the
next step will be to legalize crack and heroin.&quot;[8] This may
be the ultimate goal of proponents of these programs.

<p>

<center><h3>LEGAL BACKGROUND</h3></center>

<p>

In 1992, Congress ordered HHS to request a study of NEPs by the
National Academy of Sciences (NAS), an independent, Congressionally-chartered,
non-government research agency. If the Academy found that NEPs
were shown to be effective in reducing HIV infection while not
encouraging drug use, then the Surgeon General could lift the
ban on federal financing for such programs, Congress said.

<p>

The Academy concluded its study in 1995 and reported that well-implemented
NEPs can be effective in preventing the spread of HIV and do not
increase the use of illegal drugs. NAS recommended that &quot;[t]he
Surgeon General make the determination called for in Public Law
102-394, section 514, 1993, necessary to rescind the present prohibition
against applying any federal funds to support needle exchange
programs.&quot;[9]

<p>

While addicts can legally buy needles in all but nine states without
a medical prescription, 45 states have laws making it a crime
to carry a needle and syringe.[10] Police in these states argue that
the criminalization of drug paraphernalia helps successful drug
arrests and prosecutions.

<p>

In 1992, Connecticut modified its syringe law to permit the possession
and purchase of up to 10 needles without a prescription. But a
state-sponsored survey found that IDU needle sharing did not change
with the new law.[11]

<p>

Community NEPs do not slow illegal needle sales. Numerous studies
have found that even where NEPs operate and syringes are available
without prescription, IDUs remain dependent upon black market
sources for needles.[12]

<p>

<center><h3>THE BATTLEGROUND</h3></center>

<p>

Needle Exchange Programs are intended to curb the practice of
sharing needles among IDUs to reduce the risk of transmitting
the AIDS virus. Residual blood retained in a shared syringe can
be passed along to the next person using the syringe. This high-risk
behavior infects perhaps 20,000 Americans with the AIDS virus
every year.[13]

<p>

Providing addicts with clean needles may slow the spread of the
AIDS virus, but questions remain. Will it lead to more responsible
behavior? Will it lead addicts to seek drug treatment? Will this
practice encourage more drug abuse?

<p>

Researchers discovered that the bite of the infected female anopheles
mosquito transmitted malaria. To slow malaria's spread, researchers
theorized, the mosquito had to be destroyed. It worked. Dr. Lurie
argues that replacing tainted drug needles with clean ones would
be analogous to removing the malaria vector.[14]

<p>

Nationwide, almost one-third of all AIDS cases are associated
with IDUs. This includes almost 60 percent of children under age
13 who contracted the virus from mothers who were abusers or who
were sex partners of IDUs.[15] Today, shared needles are blamed for
more HIV infections than in the past.

<p>

In 1981, only 12 percent of AIDS victims contracted the virus
from needles but in 1993 that number had risen to 29 percent.[16]
During the same period the proportion of new cases of HIV transmission
due to sex between men declined from 74 percent to 47 percent.[17]

<p>

Most of the IDUs are found in the 96 largest metropolitan areas.
These areas also include 85 percent of all reported AIDS cases,
and nearly a quarter (23.5 percent) of all IDUs are located in
just six cities: Boston, New York City, Newark, Philadelphia,
Baltimore and Washington, D.C.[18]

<p>

The total number of IDUs is hard to predict. The U.S. Public Health
Service reports that the population exceeds one million.[19] The 1994
National Household Survey on Drug Abuse found that 2,580,000 Americans
have used needles to inject illicit drugs in their lives and 257,000
have done so in the past year.[20] A 1994 CDC report estimates that
in the nation's largest metropolitan areas alone the IDU population
exceeds 1.5 million.[21]

<p>

<center><h3>WHO ARE THE ADDICTS?</h3></center>

<p>

Terri is a 29-year-old Hispanic mother of two and an IDU. She
said, &quot;In the beginning, it was fun. I felt like Superman....It
was like I had an 'S' on my chest and I had my mask on, and I
could conquer the world. The drugs took away the bad feelings.&quot;[22]

<p>

Terri, like many addicts, started injecting just to get high.
Soon she found that the drugs were causing more pain than relief.
To support her $200-a-day habit, Terri sold heroin, got caught,
and lost custody of her children.[23] There are more than 200,000
addicts like Terri in New York City alone.[24]

<p>

According to another addict, &quot;Shooting drugs is not a rational
act....I know what it's like to be scared of getting AIDS, but
I needed to get high so bad that I didn't think about the risk.&quot;[25]

<p>

Dr. Steven Koester, an anthropologist at the University of Colorado
Health Sciences Center in Denver, explains why addicts share needles
in spite of the AIDS scare. &quot;The laws against having syringes
made it too risky to carry them on the way to get heroin. It created
an artificial scarcity. They were sharing because they had to
-- not because of some ritual for bonding.&quot; After buying
their dope, said Koester, addicts &quot;go to the closest place
where they can have privacy and get a syringe.&quot; This is typically
a &quot;shooting gallery&quot; where, for a small fee, they can
get privacy and a needle to use.[26]

<p>

It's difficult for an addict to stop injecting drugs because heroin
depletes key body chemicals. With these gone, the body experiences
intense drug cravings and withdrawal symptoms are unpleasant.
That's why a heroin addict may need four to six injections each
day, 120 to 180 times per month or 1,500 times per year. Frequent
injections with shared needles lead to increased chances of contracting
blood-borne diseases like HIV.[27]

<p>

<center><h3>HOW NEPS WORK</h3></center>

<p>

The typical NEP client is male, has been injecting between seven
and 20 years and is between 33 and 41 years old.[28] Racial/ethnic
distributions vary considerably depending upon location. One-third
to one-half of NEP clients have never been in drug treatment.[29]

<p>

The Lower East Side Harm Reduction Center [New York City] provides
numerous services. Addicts can get &quot;shooter's supplies&quot;
like alcohol pads, cotton balls, cookers, condoms, bottles of
bleach and clean water. The exchange hands out about 1,000 needles
an hour[30] or between 15,000 and 20,000 each week.[31]

<p>

The exchange also helps addicts get into treatment programs, solves
housing problems, gives lessons on safer ways of shooting drugs,
and keeps tabs on the heroin that has made its clients sick. Warnings
about bad heroin are identified by their street names on a chalkboard
hung inside the center.[32]

<p>

Mark Gerse, the center's director, said, &quot;We've become an
information clearinghouse. If we didn't get the word out, it would
take a series of deaths to get people's attention.&quot;[33]

<p>

Terri uses the Lower East Side needle exchange which operates
out of a storefront in a residential area populated by working
poor. She explains, &quot;This place gives me hope and it makes
me feel loved....This place keeps you from hurting yourself until
you're able to make a choice to straighten yourself out.&quot;[34]

<p>

Another addict who has been mainlining for more than a decade,
said, &quot;It's good to know that there's someone actually looking
after us because the truth is, nobody else cares if we kill ourselves
with bad dope.&quot;[35]

<p>

There are approximately 75 NEPs in 55 U.S. cities.[36] They operate
either from fixed sites (stationary van, storefront, street, and
health facility) or mobile sites (walk route, deliveries and roving
vans) operating a median 10 hours per week. They are staffed with
a combination of paid employees and volunteers who may provide
a variety of services in addition to exchanging needles, such
as HIV testing/counseling, tuberculosis screening, screening for
sexually transmitted diseases, primary medical care and substance
abuse treatment.[37]

<p>

<center><h3>THE SWISS NEEDLE EXPERIMENT</h3></center>

<p>

In 1986, to counter the drug problem, the Swiss began experimenting
with NEPs. The first step was to make syringes available in every
pharmacy. Switzerland also legalized syringe sales via public
vending machines. For three francs or about $2.43, anyone can
buy two syringes, extra needles, alcohol, swabs, gauze, and a
condom packaged in a cigarette-sized pack labeled &quot;Flash.&quot;[38]

<p>

In 1988, Zurich's Platzpitz Park was opened for free needle distribution.
Up to 300 syringes were given away each day. The original aim
had been to create a &quot;safe&quot; place for Zurich's own addicts.
But before long, the city was flooded with foreign addicts. The
number of needles exchanged grew to 12,000 per day before the
park was closed in 1992.[39]

<p>

After police closed Platzpitz, thousands of addicts relocated
a half-mile away to an abandoned railway station called &quot;Letten&quot;
where the Swiss experiment evolved into a grotesque spectacle.
Needle exchanges grew to 15,000 per day.[40]

<p>

Letten became a war zone between rival drug-dealing gangs. When
police tried to investigate crimes, they faced gunfire and their
cars were attacked and overturned by addicts. Local police arrested
a drug dealer after the fourth murder within just one month. Fellow
drug dealers stormed the police station demanding the man's release
or else they would blow-up the station.[41] He was released. In February,
1995, Swiss authorities closed Letten and moved the addicts to
government-sponsored centers and &quot;shooting galleries.&quot;

<p>

Dr. Franziska Haller, a Swiss psychologist, pharmacist, and anti-drug
activist, said that Zurich's permissive drug policy was designed
to put pressure on the federal government to start a nationwide
heroin distribution program. She says this is a big step toward
drug legalization -- the ultimate goal of pro-drug forces.

<p>

Opposition to NEPs and government-sponsored heroin experiments
has not been tolerated. Doctors who protested the initial NEP
were quashed by the media and pro-NEP physicians. Even a public
school teacher who warned her elementary students about the risks
of illicit drugs lost her job because of pressure from pro-drug
groups. One of her students had died from a heroin overdose.[42]

<p>

Switzerland has the highest heroin addiction rate (30,000 addicts)
and second highest HIV infection rate in Europe. It experiences
between 350 and 400 illicit drug overdose deaths each year.[43] To
address the growing problem without experiencing more &quot;Lettens,&quot;
the Swiss federal government started giving drugs to some addicts.
Switzerland has an ongoing experiment in nine cities where heroin,
morphine and methadone are given to addicts. The project, which
is scheduled to end in December, 1996, includes 700 addicts. Nearly
half of these addicts are HIV-positive. They are given free drugs
up to nine times a day. At night they are given heroin cigarettes
to be used at home. The cost is covered by health insurance or
the government.[44]

<p>

Dr. Andre Seidenberg, who runs a Swiss government-sponsored heroin
maintenance clinic for 100 addicts, believes that &quot;[h]eroin
consumption should be medicalized.&quot; He would &quot;like to
see heroin distribution trials in the U.S.&quot;[45]

<p>

The experiment's aim is to improve addict health, decrease criminal
activity, cut addicts off from drug dealers and stop abuse. Unfortunately,
the number of addicts is rising, and the experiment has not cut
illegal drug abuse and crime. It is also reported that police
officials in Bern and Zurich have been ordered not to arrest drug
consumers and dealers.[46]

<p>

On July 1, 1995, Swiss prison authorities began experimenting
with heroin-addicted inmates. Junkie prisoners with at least a
nine-month sentence who were age 20 and older were given heroin.
The rationale for this experiment was not announced.[47]

<p>

It appears that Switzerland is moving towards drug legalization.
The problems associated with NEPs and drug maintenance programs
have contributed to a shift in attitude toward drugs. On November
9, 1995, 94 Swiss executives called for the government to embrace
a &quot;harm reduction&quot; strategy that includes an expansion
of the legal heroin distribution program. Six of the executives
were representatives of American companies in Switzerland: Andersen
Consulting AG, American Express, Polaroid, Atag Ernst &amp; Young
AG, Agfa Gevaert AG and Revisuisse Price Waterhouse AG.[48]

<p>

Roland C. Rasi, general manager of the Swiss Bank Corporation,
spoke for the executives when he announced the 11-part &quot;harm
reduction&quot; strategy. The strategy would shift funds from
enforcement to treatment such as medicalized heroin distribution.
It would also demand that Swiss companies employ drug addicts
in order to better integrate them into society. He described one
Swiss company that proudly hires auto mechanics who are addicted
to heroin.

<p>

In 1996, the Swiss people will decide whether to legalize now-illicit
drugs. The vote is expected to be close. Dr. Haller said she hopes
America does not follow Switzerland's drug example.

<p>

<center><h3>WHAT DOES THE RESEARCH SAY ABOUT NEPS?</h3></center>

<p>

The Washington-based Drug Policy Foundation (DPF), which is supported
by pro-drug billionaire George Soros, has hosted several Capitol
Hill seminars to brief Congressional staff about NEPs. Arnold
Trebach, DPF's president and an American University professor,
said at one of the seminars that the &quot;[d]ominant morality
is that drug abuse is a greater threat than AIDS.&quot;[49] Trebach
said the federal government's needle exchange policy is &quot;obscene.&quot;
He says the research supports NEPs.

<p>

In September, 1995, the National Academy of Sciences announced
the results of its government-requested study of NEPs in its work,
&quot;Preventing HIV Transmission: The Role of Sterile Needles
and Bleach&quot;.[50] The panel called for the Surgeon General to
rescind the present prohibition against applying any federal funds
to support NEPs.

<p>

Dr. Moses, the study chairman, said that data from a program in
New Haven showed that the rate of HIV infection in needles turned
into the exchange had decreased by one-third.[51]

<p>

Edward Kaplan, a professor with Yale University's School of Management,
evaluated the New Haven NEP. Kaplan, a statistician, says he is
not an NEP advocate, but that he believes NEPs are effective.[52]

<p>

Moses also cited a study in Tacoma, Washington, which found a
dramatic drop in blood-borne diseases after an NEP started. That
study examined hepatitis B infection rates among NEP participants
and found these people were eight times less likely than non-participants
to contract the blood-borne infection. This study is supposedly
analogous for HIV infections.[53]

<p>

Dr. Don Des Jarlais, research director of the Chemical Dependency
Institute at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York, endorses
NAS's recommendation. &quot;Anyone who's looking at it from the
perspective of preventing HIV transmission,&quot; said Des Jarlais,
&quot;comes to the conclusion that we ought to be doing more syringe
exchange.&quot;[54]

<p>

Dr. Peter Lurie led a CDC-funded study entitled, &quot;The Public
Health Impact of Needle Exchange Programs in the United States
and Abroad,&quot; 1993. The study evaluated 23 of the programs
in 15 cities across four countries. His study was extensively
reported by the NAS. Lurie concluded that NEPs &quot;do not appear
to increase drug use and do prevent HIV infections in injecting
drug users, their sex partners, and their children.&quot;[55] His
700-page report calls for more federal funds for NEPs, repeal
of laws precluding purchase of syringes without a prescription,
and repeal of paraphernalia laws.

<p>

Lurie's analysis evaluated eight needle exchange studies that
measured drug use levels. Only one study showed an increase in
drug use. Three showed a decrease, and four found no change. Lurie
found 10 of 14 other studies that showed a reduction in HIV infection
among NEP participants.[56]

<p>

Lurie's report acknowledges numerous problems:

<p><ul>

<li>None of the studies reviewed were &quot;randomized; self-reported
behavior (subject to response bias) was often used as an outcome;
follow-up was often poor; and risk behavior was often only roughly
measured.&quot;[57]

<p>

<li>Lurie admits that he can't determine whether NEPs change the
community level of drug use, and he found no evidence that NEPs
increase use of drug treatment.[58]

<p>

<li>With regard to New Haven-type studies that test only syringes,
Lurie says, &quot;The validity of testing of syringes is limited.&quot;[59]

<p>

<li>On the key issue whether NEPs effect HIV infection rates,
Lurie states, &quot;Studies of the effect of NEPs on HIV infection
rates...probably cannot provide clear evidence that NEPs decrease
HIV infection rates. However, NEPs do not appear to be associated
with increased rates of HIV infection.&quot;[60]

</ul><p>

Even a 1993 General Accounting Office report concludes, &quot;Research
suggests [that syringe exchange programs have] promise as an AIDS
prevention strategy.&quot;[61] GAO's &quot;promise&quot; and Lurie's
&quot;cannot provide&quot; are not comforting conclusions.

<p>

On April 6, 1995, ABC's Catherine Crier interviewed Ton Quadt,
the Dutch Drug Rehabilitation Coordinator. Quadt said, &quot;If
you put in enough clean syringes and needles, people don't have
to use dirty needles, so the risk of getting HIV is lessened.&quot;
Since the program began 10 years ago, the AIDS infection rate
of those in the program has dropped from 11 percent to 4 percent.[62]

<p>

Enthusiasm for NAS's recommendation to lift the ban on NEP funding
is not universally shared. Assistant Secretary of HHS Philip Lee
said, &quot;I have not been convinced on the evidence that has
been presented so far.&quot;[63] His skepticism is well founded.

<p>

On October 16, 1989, then Secretary of HHS Louis Sullivan hosted
a conference with 12 scientific and legal experts to discuss NEPs.[64]
The consultants recommended designing a new multi-center experiment
lasting three to five years. Unfortunately, that recommendation
was never undertaken.

<p>

Lead consultant Dr. Edward Brandt, Jr., a former Assistant Secretary
for Health and then the Executive Dean of the College of Medicine
of the University of Oklahoma, said, &quot;It will be extraordinarily
difficult to provide a scientifically rigorous answer [with regard
to NEPs slowing HIV infection without increasing drug abuse].&quot;[65]

<p>

Considering the NEPs at that time, Brandt concluded, &quot;It
is not possible to perform a meaningful evaluation of existing
programs because none were designed and initiated with a stringent
evaluation approach as a primary objective. Also, comparison among
programs through a multi-center evaluation is not possible because
of major differences in program objectives, design, and operation.&quot;[66]

<p>

Brandt's reservations are evidenced in key studies cited in the
NAS report. For example, the New Haven study is based on a mathematical
model using six independent variables to predict the rate of infection.
The unreliability of any of these variables invalidates the result.

<p>

The New Haven study includes key assumptions. For example, it
assumes that any needle returned by a participant other than the
one to whom it had been issued had been shared and that any needle
returned by a participant to whom it had been issued had been
unshared.[67] Both assumptions are suspect.

<p>

More than half (60 percent) of the New Haven participants dropped
out. Those who remained in the program were most likely motivated
to protect themselves from infection and the drop-outs likely
continued in their high-risk lifestyles.[68]

<p>

The Yale study fails to consider the seroconversion rates in addicts
and also relies on self-reporting by addicts, a group not known
for reliability.

<p>

Additionally, most NEPs provide a host of services which account
for some of the reported &quot;success.&quot; Outreach programs
without needle exchange have been shown to have some effect.

<p>

Dr. Janet Lapey, a medical doctor, studies NEPs for Drug Watch
International, a worldwide anti-drug organization.[69] She critiqued
NAS's report, saying:

<p><ul>

<li>It downplays sexual transmission of HIV among addicts. Some
resort to prostitution to fund their addiction. After all, non-needle
using crack addicts have high incidence of HIV.

<p>

<li>It cites a NEP study that had no increase in heroin use by
young users. This is not surprising given that NEPs and drug treatment
programs are usually populated by older drug users.

<p>

<li>It fails to interview neighborhood residents near NEPs to
see whether they approve of the effect of these programs.

<p>

<li>It trivializes the drug problem and provides no solutions
other than NEPs.

<p>

<li>It does not cite studies that measured HIV seroconversion
rates, the only true indication of effectiveness.

<p>

<li>It does not measure whether drug use rises in NEP service
areas.

<p>

<li>It gives credibility to pro-needle studies and claims that
anti-needle studies are lacking. She says this biased use of statistics
is analogous to the tobacco companies using statisticians to support
their claim that smoking does not cause cancer.

</ul><p>

James L. Curtis, director of the Department of Psychiatry, Harlem
Hospital Center, wrote to New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman
to recommend against NEPs. Curtis said, &quot;On the unproved
assumption that these programs prevent the spread of AIDS, addicts
are actively encouraged to continue to inject themselves with
illegal drugs, and are exempted from arrest in areas surrounding
the needle exchange program. Indeed the addict is partially financed
in continuing this self-damaging behavior.&quot;[70]

<p>

Finally, Dr. Mitchell Rosenthal, director of the Phoenix House
Foundation, a drug treatment organization, said, &quot;I don't
think we have any data yet that is compelling that needle exchange
is making a difference.&quot;[71]

<p>

<center><h3>POLICY DILEMMA</h3></center>

<p>

California Governor Pete Wilson vetoed a bill that would have
authorized state-funded NEPs. He explained, the &quot;[r]eal question...is
whether the hoped-for reduction in needle-transmitted HIV infection
justifies sending a mixed message that will threaten to undermine
the credibility of all society's other anti-drug efforts -- especially
those preventive education efforts aimed at dissuading young audiences
from choosing to engage in drug use.&quot;[72]

<p>

The NAS agrees with Wilson's reservations. The report says, &quot;The
long-term effects of these programs on the level of illicit drug
use in communities are not yet known.&quot;[73] It acknowledges that
&quot;the act of giving a needle to an IDU has a powerful symbolism
that has sparked fears about the potential negative effects of
NEPs.&quot;[74]

<p>

Wilson recognizes the hyperbolic nature of a pro-needle policy.
&quot;If we are going to demand that young people exercise personal
responsibility,&quot; Wilson explained, and &quot;if we say that
they must suffer the consequences of their personal choices, [then]
what are they to think, when in the next breath we give formal
sanction to a project which facilitates drug use?&quot;[75]

<p>

Congressman Charles Rangel (D-N.Y.) opposes NEPs. He has said,
&quot;Our goal should be to eliminate drug abuse, not to find
a cleaner, safer way to do it. Sure, IV drug abusers put themselves
at risk of AIDS through sharing needles and, certainly, we want
to slow its spread, but there are better ways than giving addicts
needles to do their drugs.&quot;[76]

<p>

Former national drug czar William Bennett agrees. NEPs are rejected
because they &quot;may also confound a community's anti-drug efforts
by implicitly condoning the intravenous use of illegal drugs.&quot;[77]

<p>

Lee Brown, who resigned as President Clinton's drug czar last
December, said the Office of National Drug Control Policy &quot;can
find no compelling reason for the administration to depart from
existing federal policy regarding needle exchange...[It] is neither
an adequate substitute for drug treatment nor a preferred means
of entry into drug treatment.&quot;[78]

<p>

Dr. Moses, chairman of the NAS panel, claims that NEPs &quot;often
result in more referrals to drug abuse treatment.&quot;[79] Evidence
to support this statement is minimal.

<p>

Most addicts in treatment are there because of a run-in with the
criminal justice system, not because of a run-in with an NEP.
According to Dr. Lapey, only 16 percent of NEP participants voluntarily
enter treatment.[80]

<p>

Two of the three medical doctors on the NAS panel, Dr. Herbert
D. Kleber and Dr. Lawrence S. Brown, claim that the news media
have exaggerated NAS's findings and that NEPs &quot;are not the
panacea their supporters hope for....We personally believe that
the spread of HIV is better combated by the expansion and improvement
of drug abuse treatment rather than NEPs, and any government funds
should instead be used for that purpose.&quot;[81]

<p>

A myth associated with NEPs is that there is a long wait for treatment.
But according to Rosenthal, treatment candidates are not turned
away without help. There is a four-week waiting period for in-patient
treatment, but all candidates for admission are placed into a
&quot;day care&quot; program until such time as beds become available.
The &quot;day care&quot; unit lasts eight hours a day, and patients
can receive AIDS education and counseling.[82]

<p>

Rosenthal says that the greatest HIV threat among heterosexuals
is from sexual contact, not dirty needles. Clean needles will
not modify sexual behavior in the IDU. He explains that in the
New Haven study, fewer than a third of the participants employed
safe-sex practices most of the time.[83]

<p>

Dr. David Williams of the University of Michigan Institute for
Social Research says that NEPs raise important ethical and moral
problems. &quot;People can be morally compelled,&quot; said Williams,
&quot;to support a lesser harm [drug abuse] in order to overcome
a greater harm [AIDS].&quot;[84]

<p>

In response to this philosophy, Rep. Rangel said, &quot;Supporters
of free needles may have their hearts in the right place, but
they have overlooked some very important considerations. These
people should enlist in efforts to expand comprehensive treatment
and rehabilitation services. Better to stop needle use altogether.&quot;[85]

<p>

<center><h3>HOW MUCH SUPPORT DO NEPS ENJOY?</h3></center>

<p>

The DPF and the NAS report say that the public favors NEPs. They
site a 1994 survey of 1,001 Americans by Peter D. Hart Research
Associates, Inc., Washington, D.C., which showed that 55 percent
favor implementing NEPs to reduce the spread of diseases such
as AIDS.[86]

<p>

The NAS report also profiles 23 other surveys with mixed results.
A 1988 <I>CBS News/New York Times</I> national poll found that
only 40 percent of Americans favor giving injection drug users
sterilized needles to slow down the spread of AIDS. A 1989 Media
General/<I>Associated Press</I> national poll found that half
of all Americans favor giving needles to addicts given the promise
that it will slow down the spread of AIDS.[87]

<p>

To measure America's commitment to NEPs, pollsters should set
a better context for the needle question. Perhaps the pollster
should ask, &quot;Would you support giving clean needles to drug
addicts to slow the spread of HIV, if you knew that this policy
shift might increase illicit drug use among America's youth?&quot;
Most likely, a majority of Americans would answer &quot;no.&quot;

<p>

<center><h3>WHAT ARE THE SOCIAL CONSEQUENCES?</h3></center>

<p>

There is ample evidence that NEPs contribute to serious social
consequences for affected communities. For example, Regina Policastro,
an editor for a small Boston newspaper, wrote about her experience
with an NEP client. On November 11, 1991, &quot;a woman, having
received a state-provided free needle, engaged in prostitution,
and overdosed right in front of Policastro's child in her yard.&quot;[88]
Police did nothing because the woman had an authorized needle
identification card.

<p>

The plentiful supply of free needles has created a rogue practice.
The <I>Boston Herald</I> reports that Boston police were on the
lookout for a junkie who obtains allegedly AIDS-tainted needles
from a local NEP and then sells them for use as weapons. An unidentified
Boston officer overheard schoolkids say, &quot;It's better than
a gun because a gun you can do time for.&quot;[89] Similar scares
are common among New York City commuters.

<p>

Reverend Steve Peterson, pastor of Holy Cross Lutheran Church
in Madison, Wisconsin, expressed grave concern that Madison's
NEP -- which is only 250 feet from the school -- will put his
parish elementary school children at risk. He explained, &quot;Our
concern is that the needle exchange violates the spirit of the
drug-free zone.&quot;[90]

<p>

Milt McPike, a Madison high school principal, said, &quot;I have
a lot of concerns about stuff like that [NEPs] near schools.&quot;[91]
His job is to protect children, and their welfare must be balanced
with the need to control HIV among drug addicts.

<p>

Nancy Sosman knows all too well the problems NEPs bring to a community.
Sosman is a member of the Coalition for a Better Community, a
New York City citizens group opposed to NEPs. Since the Lower
East Side NEP began, she says, &quot;We've seen an increase in
dirty syringes on our streets, in our school yards and in our
parks....There has been a dramatic increase in the public display
of injecting drugs.... Brazen addicts shoplift, loot and steal
to buy drugs.&quot;[92] Sosman says that there are no controls on
the number of syringes given to an addict at the NEP and in fact,
she has seen NEP participants sell their syringes to buy drugs.
Even &quot;exchange workers have been photographed selling needles
away from the NEP.&quot;[93]

<p>

New Haven Police Chief Nicholas Pastore supports NEPs. Pastore
told ABC's Catherine Crier, &quot;The thing that I feel good about
is that that heroin addict is not preying on society, is not killing
somebody, not banging somebody on the head, not breaking into
your or my home. They're getting help....&quot;[94]

<p>

That's not Nancy Sosman's observation. She says that the NEP participants
fan out into her neighborhood &quot;to buy drugs, use drugs, sell
drugs and steal to get money for drugs. Our local police will
never be able to stop the trafficking of illegal drugs.&quot;[95]

<p>

Curtis contends that NEPs are bad medicine. &quot;The police make
no attempt to arrest addicts even though it still is illegal to
possess and inject illegal drugs. The drug dealers flock to these
neighborhoods in order to sell drugs which are openly used even
in broad daylight. These neighborhoods experience dramatic deterioration
with a corrupting influence on many candy stores, newspaper stands
and grocery stores. The sidewalks are littered with used and bloody
needles, syringes and empty vials of crack cocaine. Furthermore
some addicts make a business of selling these needles to purchase
other drugs such as cocaine which they prefer.[96]

<p>

Curtis continues, &quot;Addicts commonly support their habit by
selling drugs to other addicts, by recruiting new addicts, and
by prostitution or by exchanging sex for drugs, all of which behavior
contributes to spread of the AIDS virus.&quot;[97]

<p>

NEPs &quot;promote a breakdown in law and order,&quot; the Harlem
doctor says. &quot;They are poor medicine and poor public health
practice. In fact, these programs constitute a reckless experiment
with human beings, totally unregulated by research guidelines
ordinarily applied to protect human subjects from potentially
dangerous research.&quot;[98]

<p>

<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>

<p>

On April 2, 1995, Saudi Arabia beheaded three drug smugglers.
A little earlier, Singapore did the same.[99] There are no NEPs in
Riyadh and few addicts on Singapore's streets. Neither country
has an AIDS epidemic.

<p>

If America seeks to reduce drug use, it must stop coddling addicts.
Drug abusers need treatment, not encouragement to keep injecting
deadly drugs. Although AIDS will kill some, most will die from
drug overdoses or other high-risk behaviors.

<p>

Congressman Rangel tells public officials not to fool themselves
about NEPs. &quot;Can police honestly enforce laws against people
who use 'government-issue' needles when the government is the
very source of the tool to commit the offense?&quot;[100]

<p>

The growing needle exchange debate is really about drug legalization.
Pro-drug forces have nurtured a cadre of scientists and others
to give their fight the appearance of legitimacy. But they have
yet to satisfy the strict, scientific requirements set forth in
the law.

<p>

Before the federal government boards this <I>Titanic</I>, it should
sponsor research like that suggested by former Secretary of HHS
Sullivan or even embrace some of Dr. Lurie's recommendations for
methodologically-sound NEP studies. Then, if the evidence satisfies
the requirements of Congress, the lifting of the funding ban could
be reconsidered.

<p>

In the meantime, missteps with the NEP policy could lead the nation
down a tragic path. NEPs provide no guarantee to solve the AIDS
epidemic nor stop the drug scourge.

On May 20, 1996, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional
Colorado's Amendment 2 to the state constitution, which had prohibited
the state and local jurisdictions from adding &quot;sexual orientation&quot;
to minority protection statutes.  The amendment, approved by a
majority of voters in 1992,  was drafted after several Colorado
cities -- Denver, Boulder, Aspen and Aurora -- had enacted statutes
adding &quot;sexual orientation&quot; to the list of protected
civil rights, thus affording homosexuals a vehicle to use civil
rights law in discrimination claims.

<p>

Amendment 2's sponsors viewed this &quot;special&quot; protection
to homosexuals as a threat to those who believe that homosexuality
is wrong and not a valid category for heightened protection heretofore
reserved for genuinely-disadvantaged minorities.

<p>

In a 6-3 ruling,[1] the court disagreed, saying that Amendment 2
violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment to
the Constitution because the state could not prove a &quot;rational
basis,&quot; that is, a &quot;legitimate legislative end&quot;
for denying homosexuals &quot;the possibility of protection across
the board.&quot;  Thus, the Supreme Court affirmed the earlier
ruling of the trial court and the Colorado Supreme Court in striking
down Amendment 2.

<p>

<center><h3>WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS RULING?</h3></center>

<p>

It sweeps aside the right of the people to amend their own state
Constitution, at least with regard to homosexuality.  The court,
in effect, said that it, and it alone, will determine which groups
can be considered &quot;disadvantaged&quot; when they lose a statewide
ballot issue.  By this reasoning, any state that has outlawed
polygamy has &quot;disadvantaged&quot; polygamists by making it
unlawful for them to enact legalization of polygamy at the local
level.  In his forceful dissent, Justice Antonin Scalia addressed
this particular absurdity:  &quot;Has the court concluded that
the perceived social harm of polygamy is a 'legitimate concern
of government,' and the perceived social harm of homosexuality
is not?&quot;

<p>

Homosexual activists now have a guarantee that their opponents
will be prevented ever from rescinding &quot;sexual orientation&quot;
laws at the state level.  Homosexual activists can work to get
&quot;gay rights&quot; laws on the books, but no group of voters
is allowed ever to rescind them at the state level.

<p>

The court's decision has not technically created a brand new class
of specially-protected citizens:  homosexuals.  But no other group
has that kind of heightened protection except for those that have
been designated as &quot;suspect&quot; classes in need of special
protections.  No court -- including the current Supreme Court
-- has ever designated homosexuals as a &quot;suspect class.&quot;

<p>

The cultural impact may be greater than the legal implications.
<I>The New York Times'</I> lead headline on May 21 proclaimed,
&quot;Gay Rights Laws Can't Be Banned, High Court Rules.&quot;
Although technically the ruling only applies to state laws that
bar passage of new gay rights laws, <I>Romer v. Evans</I> was
hailed as a repudiation of any efforts to delay consolidation
of the homosexual agenda.  Within hours of the decision, the Supreme
Court's ruling was cited by an attorney in a lesbian parenting
dispute in Florida, who proclaimed that the high court had outlawed
the use of sexual orientation as a factor in child custody cases.
The court did no such thing, but we can expect more of the same
sweeping interpretations to be used to sway a reeling culture
that has been force-fed homosexual propaganda for the past decade.
As Suzanne Goldberg of Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund
exulted after the decision, &quot;Because the court so clearly
rejected anti-gay sentiment, it plants the seeds for future decisions
rejecting anti-gay decisions in many other areas.&quot;[2]

<p>

<h4>Wasn't this a victory for tolerance of gay and lesbian people?</h4>

<p>

No. Homosexuals have achieved enormous tolerance and are now
seeking state-mandated acceptance of their behavior.  The <I>Romer
</I> decision was a defeat of the Colorado people's desire to create
a level playing field with regard to civil rights.  A majority
of Coloradans passed Amendment 2 so that people who disagree with
the homosexual activist movement would not be subjected to discrimination
in &quot;gay rights&quot; jurisdictions such as Aspen, Denver,
Boulder and Aurora.  As Justice Scalia put it in his dissent,
&quot;The only denial of equal treatment [the Court] contends
homosexuals have suffered is this:  They may not obtain preferential
treatment without amending the state constitution.&quot;  He also
said, &quot;The Court has no business imposing upon all Americans
the resolution favored by the elite class from which the members
of this institution are selected, pronouncing that animosity toward
homosexuality...is evil.&quot;  Note that Justice Scalia did not
say animosity toward homosexuals.  In singling out the behavioral
characteristic in question, Scalia correctly reflected the Christian
view of loving the sinner but hating the sin. The state should
never give preferential treatment on the basis of  behavior that
has been discouraged in all major cultures for thousands of years
and by all major religions.

<p>

<h4>The court cited some previous case law in its decision.  Isn't
this a well-founded ruling?</h4>

<p>

The court, indeed, cited some cases in which legal protections
have been extended to particular groups that are not officially
&quot;suspect&quot; classes but are &quot;identifiable&quot; groups.
But, overall, the opinion was so legally impoverished that it
had to be fashioned, as Scalia remarked,  &quot;so long on emotive
utterance and so short on relevant legal citation.&quot;  The
court's opinion fails to address <I>Bowers v. Hardwick</I>, the
1986 case in which the court ruled that there is no constitutional
protection for homosexuality.  So if it is legal to criminalize
the act of sodomy, then why can't a state decline to extend special
protections for a class of people whose only defining characteristic
is that they practice sodomy?

<p>

<h4>Doesn't Amendment 2 take away the civil rights of homosexuals?</h4>

<p>

No. It just prohibits the addition of special rights that others
do not have.  As Justice Scalia wrote, &quot;The Colorado Amendment
does not, to speak entirely precisely, prohibit giving favored
status to people who are homosexuals; they can be favored for
many reasons -- for example, because they are senior citizens
or members of racial minorities.  But it prohibits them favored
status <I>because of their homosexual conduct</I>....(italics
in original)&quot;

<p>

In other words, homosexuals were in no danger of losing any civil
rights despite press accounts that incorrectly say that Amendment
2 &quot;strips homosexuals of their civil rights.&quot;  They
just could not gain new rights based solely on their predilection
to practice homosexuality.

<p>

<h4>The court ruled that no rational basis could be found to justify
Amendment Two.  What's wrong with that?</h4>

<p>

Ignoring numerous examples of how &quot;sexual orientation&quot;
protections can be wielded against ordinary citizens, the court
essentially concluded that the Colorado people's sole reason for
enacting Amendment 2 was an &quot;animus&quot; toward homosexuals.
This means the court is calling more than 800,000 Coloradans
&quot;hate-filled bigots&quot; and declaring that they had no
rational basis whatever for approving the amendment.  It also
means that God-fearing people in all major religions who believe
homosexuality is wrong are now deemed to be outside the realm
of decency.  This is a sweeping condemnation of the deeply-held
beliefs of billions of people around the world.

<p>

<h4>The court said that gay rights are not &quot;special rights.&quot;
Why do you say they are?</h4>

<p>

Homosexuals have the same rights all citizens have.  They have
the same redress that all citizens have if they face discrimination.
They want an extra level of preferential treatment that would
allow them to cite their homosexuality anytime they do not get
what they want -- a job, a promotion, whatever.  People who commit
adultery do not have such a right.  People who abuse drugs do
not have such a right.  In fact, nobody else has the right to
insist that their behavior is irrelevant to an employer.  &quot;Gay
rights&quot; laws are a massive club with which to beat everyone
else into acceding to homosexuals' increasingly strident demands
for mandated acceptance.  As social critic David Frum writes,
&quot;Antidiscrimination law may invoke the language of rights
and freedoms, but its true function is to shrink the ambit of
freedom in order to promote equality.  The landlady who does not
want to rent an apartment to a tenant whose habits and friends
frighten her; the hardware store owner who wants to hire someone
he regards as trustworthy -- new antidiscrimination rules shrink
even further the liberty of these people to use their property
as they see fit or to hire whom they like.&quot;[3]

<p>

<h4>Can you give some examples of this?</h4>

<p><ul>

<li>In Ontario, Canada, the mayor of Hamilton was personally fined
$5,000 for running afoul of that city's human rights ordinance
that includes sexual orientation.  His crime?  He declined to
issue a special proclamation that the city would celebrate a &quot;gay
pride week.&quot;[4] The mayor in no way threatened the rights of
homosexuals, but was personally punished for failing to use his
city office to celebrate homosexuality.

<p>

<li>The Boy Scouts of America have been under severe legal attack
by homosexual activists in states that have &quot;gay rights&quot;
laws.[5] Their crime? They updheld their 80-year-old moral tradition
that bans openly homosexual men from becoming leaders over young
boys.

<p>

<li>In San Fernando, California, Superior Court Judge John Farrell
was told by other judges in 1995 that he should quit his activities
as a parent volunteer for the Boy Scouts or resign from the bench.
His crime?  The Scouts &quot;discriminate&quot; on the basis
of sexual orientation, which is a protected category under California's
&quot;gay rights&quot; law. A proposed judicial rule would also
ban participation by judges in any group that discriminates on
the basis of sexual orientation.  So Farrell's volunteer work
with the Boy Scouts is a violation of  &quot;judicial ethics.&quot;[6]

<p>

<li>In Seattle, Washington, a small-business employer, Bryan Griggs,
was hauled before the city's human rights board.  His crime?
He allegedly violated the rights of a homosexual employee whom
he had laid off.  The employer did not know the employee was gay.
The employer had had to lay off the entire staff during a downturn.
The employee's claim to &quot;discrimination&quot; consisted
of his employer's playing Christian talk radio on which ads for
the business were running (this constituted a &quot;hate&quot;
crime), posting a letter from a Congresswoman regarding the 
gays-in-the-military issue, and having a note on his desk that he wrote 
to himself regarding homosexuals and adoption of children.  After spending
thousands of dollars defending himself, Griggs saw the case finally
dismissed for lack of substance.[7]  But the point was made to other
employers --  mess with any homosexual employee or would-be employee
and you will be legally harassed.

</ul><p>

<center><h3>SUMMARY</h3></center>

<p>

In striking down Amendment 2, the court ignored a wealth of case
law, twisted the meaning of the Constitution, ignored the reality
of homosexual behavior, and intervened heavily on the side of
homosexual activism against those who believe that homosexuality
is wrong.

<p>

Justice Scalia summed up the case by writing, &quot;Today's opinion
has no foundation in American constitutional law, and barely pretends
to.  The people of Colorado have adopted an entirely reasonable
provision which does not even disfavor homosexuals in any substantive
sense, but merely denies them preferential treatment.  Amendment
2 is designed to prevent piecemeal deterioration of the sexual
morality favored by a majority of Coloradans, and is not only
an appropriate means to that legitimate end, but a means that
Americans have employed before.  Striking it down is an act, not
of judicial judgment, but of political will.&quot;

<p>

In the face of an increasingly strident homosexual rights movement,
the court has declared war on the beliefs of millions of ordinary
Americans.

<p>

This is the real message of &quot;gay rights&quot; -- affirm what
we do or we will use legal means to harass you.  Americans who
want to stay neutral will soon find that this is a stance that
homosexual activists -- and now the Supreme Court -- will not
afford them.

<h2>STORM CLOUDS OR A DRIZZLE?<br>
A LOOK AT A NEW STUDY ON<br>
CHILD CARE</h2>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

<p>

<i>Brenda Hunter, Ph.D.</i></center>

<p>

The National Institutes of Child
Health and Human Development (NICHD) recently released the initial
findings of a new child care study &quot;and fired the shot
heard round the world.&quot;  In this long-term study that plans
to track the effects of child care on children's development
through 7 years of age, the results of phase one rendered a body
blow to mothers choosing to provide full-time care for their babies.
Within days, the <I>Los Angeles Times</I> headlines read &quot;Child
Care No Risk to Infant-Mother Ties,&quot; and <I>The Guardian</I>
reported, &quot;Child Care Report Backs Working Mums.&quot;
Meanwhile, mothers here and abroad tried to make sense of a study
that implied &quot;other care&quot; was as good as &quot;mother
care,&quot; at least in terms of a baby's attachment relationship
with his or her mother.

<p>

<center><h3>THE MEANING OF ATTACHMENT</h3></center>

<p>

Just what is meant by the term &quot;attachment?&quot;
In his l969 book <I>Attachment,</I> the late British psychiatrist
John Bowlby wrote about the centrality of the baby's attachment
to his mother which he believed was &quot;the foundation stone
of personality.&quot;[1] Bowlby added that a &quot;young child's
hunger for his mother's love and presence is as great as
his hunger for food&quot; and that &quot;her absence inevitably
generates a powerful sense of loss and anger.&quot;[2] Freud would
agree with Bowlby on the importance of the mother or mothering
figure in the child's early life.  Writing in <I>An Outline
of Psychoanalysis</I>, he described the relationship a child has
with his mother as &quot;unique, without parallel, established
unalterably for a whole lifetime as the first and strongest love
object and as the prototype of all later love relations -- for
both sexes.&quot;[3]

<p>

The formation of attachment -- or
the emotional bond between a mother and her baby -- is a critical
developmental milestone during the first year of life.  In fact,
psychologists Alan Sroufe and Everett Waters call this enduring
bond a &quot;psychological tether which binds infant and caregiver
together.&quot;[4] From his earliest attachments, first to mother,
then to father, a baby develops a sense of his own worthiness,
conscience, and the capacity for intimacy in later significant
relationships.[5] He also learns -- generally by 12 months of age
-- whether or not he can trust his mother to meet his
physical and emotional needs.  If his mother is sensitive, consistent
and responsive in meeting his myriad needs, he is likely to be
securely attached to her.  If she is unpredictable in her ministrations
or rejecting, then the  mother and her baby will tend to develop
an insecure emotional bond or attachment.

<p>

<center><h3>THE NICHD STUDY</h3></center>

<p>

Just what did the NICHD-supported
scientists discover about the effects of child care on a baby's
attachment to his mother?  The study, which has followed 1,300
families at l0 different sites since 1991, found that child care,
<I>in and of itself</I>, does not harm the baby's emotional
bond with his mother.[6] Indeed, the researchers state that the
type of child care, the quality of care, the number of hours per
week in care and even the age the baby enters care do not create
an insecure attachment.  With this ammunition, the media heralded
the current study as a challenge to, or even  repudiation of,
earlier infant day care research, as well as a blanket endorsement
of child care for employed mothers.  Upon examination, however,
the NICHD study does not quite deliver the broadside to on-site
mothering that the media contends.  In fact, it contains some
important caveats to the central finding that child care neither
helps nor hurts the baby's attachment relationship to his
mother.

<p>

For example, the NICHD researchers
found that if a baby was unlucky enough to have an &quot;insensitive
mother,&quot; then the child care variables mattered.  Thus,
the &quot;dual risk&quot; of an insensitive mother <I>plus</I> 
poor quality child care, <I>or</I> inconsistency of care,
<I>or</I> more than l0 hours per week in care increased the likelihood
that a baby would be insecurely attached to his mother. While
the study did not contain a profile of the insensitive mother
(whether she was divorced, employed, stressed, and lonely, or
married, at home, financially strapped, and depressed), it did
find, as one would expect, that a sensitive mother who was well-adjusted
psychologically was more likely to have a securely attached child
than her insensitive counterpart.

<p>

The NICHD study also found significant
gender differences in terms of the effects of child care on attachment
security.  Infant boys who spent <I>more than</I> 30 hours per
week in child care were at risk for insecure attachment while
girls who spent <I>less than</I> 10 hours per week in care were
&quot;somewhat&quot; more likely to be insecurely attached
to their mothers.  Psychologist Jay Belsky of Pennsylvania State
University, one of the study's researchers, explained these
particular findings this way:  &quot;Separation might prove
stressful for boys, but girls who are at home with mothers extensively
may become too close and enmeshed.&quot;[7] Belsky's interpretation
prompted <I>Washington Times</I> columnist Suzanne Fields to write,
&quot;In other words, mommies who spend a lot of time with their
infant daughters are dangerous to their daughters' mental
health.&quot;[8]

<p>

Additionally, the NICHD study found
that a mother's belief system affected her baby's
attachment security. Those mothers who believed that maternal
employment actually &quot;benefited&quot; their babies'
development placed their children in child care earlier and for
more hours than did those mothers who held &quot;weaker&quot;
beliefs.  Those mothers who felt child care was harmful to their
children but used it anyway tended to have more securely attached
children than their less anxious counterparts.

<p>

How to explain this apparent conundrum?
While some may wonder about the negative psychological implications
of being riven by guilt and anxiety, Belsky suggests, &quot;It
may be that some guilt and anxiety keeps you alert, vigilant and
able to monitor the quality of care.  Being cavalier about the
effects of work turns out to be risky.&quot;[9]

<p>

<center><h3>THE NICHD FINDINGS AND THE ONGOING INFANT DAY CARE 
DEBATE</h3></center>

<p>

Why were the NICHD findings so provocative?
The findings, as <I>The Guardian</I> so aptly stated,
&quot;go to the heart of an enduringly bitter debate&quot;
about the effects of child care on a baby's emotional security
during that critical first year of life.[10] This debate affects
a huge number of American families and touches on an emotion-laden
issue:  How best to raise America's children.  Not only
do more than half the mothers of infants under one year of age
participate in the work force, but in this particular study more
than half of the infants were in some form of child care for more
than 30 hours per week by the end of their first year.[11] In addition,
the NICHD study flies in the face of accumulated evidence since
the early 1980s, which  found that placing a baby in substitute
care, even good quality care, for 20 or more hours per week during
that critical first year, not only increased the baby's
risk of insecure attachment to mother and/or father, but also
was often the harbinger of behavioral and emotional problems later
on.

<p>

<center><h3>EARLIER INFANT DAY CARE RESEARCH</h3></center>

<p>

For example, in l988 researchers
Jay Belsky and Michael Rovine evaluated the effects of child care
on 491 infants and found that those who experienced 20 or more
hours per week of nonmaternal care during the first year of life
were more likely to be classified as insecurely attached to their
mothers than those who spent less time in care.  In l989,
psychologist  Alison Clarke-Stewart found similar results in
her analysis of 1,247 infants.[12]

<p>

When researchers looked at the long-term
effects of infant day care, they often discovered that early entry
into day care signaled later behavioral and emotional problems.
Evidence from as early as the mid-1970s indicates that children
who began child care during their first year were more physically
and verbally aggressive with peers and adults, less cooperative,
and less able to handle frustrations than those who started care
thereafter.[13] For instance, a l985 study at the University of North
Carolina found that children who entered child care during their
first year were more likely to &quot;hit, kick and push other
children&quot; as kindergartners and first-graders than those
who began care later on.[14] In light of these and other findings,
it is not surprising that a full scale ideological war is in progress,
or that the current study produced such a rousing and widespread
media response.

<p>

<center><h3>WHAT THE NEWSPAPERS DID NOT REPORT</h3></center>

<p>

As a psychologist who has followed
the child care debate since the early 1980s, what struck me about
the current study were the findings that never made the newspapers,
namely these statistics:

<p><ul>

<li>About 42 percent of male infants were insecurely attached to 
their mothers when they worked more than 30 hours per week.  (This 
is a hefty number in light of proven male vulnerability to psychological 
and behavioral problems).

<p>

<li>When insensitive mothers placed their babies with insensitive 
caregivers, 56 percent of the babies were insecurely attached -- an 
obvious double-whammy for the babies.

<p>

<li>If insensitive mothers placed their babies in child care for more 
than 10 hours per week, between 46-48 percent were insecurely attached 
to their mothers.  (Evidence that simply placing a child in day care 
for more hours does not eradicate the need for time with mother, even 
when she's relatively insensitive.)

<p>

<li>When insensitive mothers placed their children in more than one 
child care situation, 44 percent were insecurely attached.  (This 
shows that inconsistent care coupled with an unresponsive mother is 
hazardous to attachment security.)

</ul><p>

These statistics gain significance
when we realize that in cross-cultural attachment research using
the Strange Situation-- the laboratory experiment developed by
psychologist Mary Ainsworth and her colleagues and used by researchers
in the NICHD study to determine attachment security -- about 35
percent of the infants are insecurely attached to their mothers.[15]
In most of the analyses in the current study, the rate of attachment
insecurity among the children is between 42 and 56 percent.  This
difference is not insignificant when translated into emotional
insecurity in children's lives.

<p>

<center><h3>MALE VULNERABILITY</h3></center>

<p>

The findings about infant male attachment
insecurity are particularly noteworthy since previous research
has found that males are generally more vulnerable than females
to a host of physiological and psychological ills.  Not only are
males more susceptible than females to speech, learning and behavioral
difficulties, but they are three to five times more likely to
have reading problems.[16] In the arena of emotional disorders, more
males than females suffer from night terrors, hyperactivity, and
autism.  Moreover, adolescent males have a higher incidence of
schizophrenia, delinquency, academic underachievement, and suicide
than females.  According to psychologist Dee Shepherd-Look, &quot;Until
adulthood, it is difficult to find a pathological condition in
which the incidence among females is higher than among males.&quot;[17]

<p>

What happens when mother returns
to the work force?  Researchers Belsky and Rovine found that,
in terms of attachment security, if a mother worked more than
35 hours per week during the baby's first year of life,
50 percent of the sons were more likely to be insecurely attached
to their fathers.[18] A 1987 study by P. Lindsay Chase-Lansdale and
Margaret Owen found similar results.[19] Also, studies of elementary
school children have discovered that boys are more likely than
girls to suffer when mother works outside the home.[20] In light
of earlier and current research, it is reasonable to suggest that
mothers of sons think long and hard about working full-time during
their babies' vulnerable first year of life.

<center><h3>HIGH QUALITY CARE AND THE INSENSITIVE MOTHER</h3></center>

<p>

As for the insensitive mother and
her baby, the NICHD researchers found that high quality child
care did not entirely compensate for a mother's relative
unresponsiveness.  This was the opposite of what they expected
to find.  In other words, if a baby had an insensitive mother,
the researchers hypothesized that it would be better for that
baby to spend more time away from her in the care of a sensitive
caregiver.  But this did not, in fact, prove true.  Instead, if
the insensitive mother worked part-time rather than full-time,
then her baby was more likely to be securely attached to her (65
percent vs. 56 percent secure, respectively).  This finding supports
the idea that high quality day care does not compensate for mother
care, even when a mother is relatively insensitive.

<p>

It's important to pause at
this point and ask ourselves just how many mothers, some of whom
may be  practicing &quot;defensive careerism,&quot; are able
to be genuinely sensitive and responsive to their babies'
cries and bids for attention, particularly if these mothers are
harried or super-stressed by the multiple demands of their lives?
How is a mother to know for sure that she is creating a secure
emotional bond with her baby as she goes off to work for 10-12
hours per day?  Even this study found that working more than 10
hours per week (that's a mere  two hours per day) puts
the child of the insensitive mother at risk for insecure attachment.
Unless a woman is confident that she is a sensitive mother who
is creating a strong, secure emotional bond with her baby, it
may be wise to err on the side of quantity rather than quality
time during the baby's first year of life.

<p>

<center><h3>CONCERNS ABOUT THE DATA</h3></center>

<p>

A careful review of the NICHD study,
arouses some very real concerns.  First, 20 of the 25 researchers
are women.  Since all scientific study is, to some extent, contaminated
by bias, there is reason to wonder just how many of these researchers
relied on day care for their own children and may, therefore,
have a personal stake in the report's outcome.  In other words,
is the methodology or even the interpretation of the data, in
this instance, subject to serious bias?  When I posed this question
to psychologist Martha Cox of the University of North Carolina,
one of the study's researchers, she admitted, &quot;Most
of us have used early and extensive child care for our children.&quot;
She said that both of her children had been in child care since
they were two months of age.  But she was quick to add, &quot;If
we tried to get value-free researchers, we wouldn't have
anybody doing research.&quot;

<p>

That this issue is not a red herring
is evident in the article written by Dr. Jay Belsky for <I>Zero
to Three</I> in l986 that set off a firestorm among some
of the researchers involved in the NICHD study.  In this article
entitled &quot;Infant Day Care:  A Cause for Concern,&quot;
Belsky not only reviewed disturbing evidence on the effects of
early and extensive child care but admitted that scientists must
struggle to maintain an open mind when it comes to controversial
and emotion-laden issues. He stated, &quot;I am well aware, too,
that my <I>gender</I> and the more or less <I>traditional nature
of my family structure</I> (italics mine) could bias the reading
of the evidence.&quot;[21]

<p>

So how did the NICHD researchers
attempt to control for bias?  While Cox stated that the data were
coded in a central location (The University of Washington in Seattle)
and not by the individual researchers themselves, Belsky told
me in an interview that those who coded  the data knew this was
a study of child care.  &quot;If they erred, they erred on the
side of finding attachment security,&quot; he said.  Then he
added, &quot;If there's bias it could be the readiness
to embrace the finding that kids aren't affected by child
care -- to give the green light to child care.  If this were a
study of cocaine use and researchers found the same effects, who
would say cocaine use doesn't matter?&quot;

<p>

Additionally, the study examined
a mother's attitudes about the &quot;benefit&quot; of
maternal employment on her baby's development and found
that mothers torn by guilt and anxiety were more likely to have
securely attached babies.  Just what are we to surmise from this?
Does this finding imply that it is okay for mothers to be in
turmoil over their employment decisions as long as their babies
are emotionally secure?  As a therapist who works almost exclusively
with women, I would  suggest that it is hardly a positive for
mothers to have their hearts divided.  Over time, guilt and anxiety
tend to produce depression, and no child profits from having a
depressed mother.

<p>

I am also concerned that the NICHD
researchers examined a mother's attitudes when her baby
was one month old.  Mothers often dramatically change their attitudes
toward separation from their babies over the course of the first
six months after delivery.  In my own doctoral research on adult
attachment and attitudes toward employment conducted at Georgetown
University, I interviewed 89 new mothers two to three days after
they had delivered their firstborn infants and then again four
months later.[22] Not surprisingly, I found that over the course
of four months a number of the women had changed their attitudes
about leaving their babies to return to work.  It was not unusual
for them to say that they had fallen in love with their babies
and could not bear to leave them.

<p>

Finally, since much of the attachment
research using the Strange Situation has looked at a baby's
attachment relationship with his parents when he was 12 months
old, and then again at 18 months to track the stability of the
attachment classification, just why did the NICHD researchers
elect to study the babies at l5 months of age? If this &quot;largest,
longest, and most comprehensive study yet&quot; is to challenge
and even repudiate earlier findings, then why not examine the
mother-baby attachment relationship at the usual 12-month marker?
When asked about this, Dr. Cox said, &quot;We were using other
measures at 15 months and so using the Strange Situation then
was optimal for everything.&quot;  She added, &quot;There's
lots of stability (in attachment patterns) in the 12-18 month
range, though there's always a possibility that things
could change developmentally.&quot;  When asked if this difference
in the research design might have affected the study's
outcome, Belsky replied that the researchers had debated this
issue and reached a &quot;compromise solution.&quot;  Yet one
is left with a feeling of nagging doubt.  In the changing world
of infancy and the forging of emotional bonds, do these three
extra months make a significant difference?

<p>

<center><h3>FINAL THOUGHTS</h3></center>

<p>

Whatever questions the study raises,
in the final analysis, it affirms the importance of mothering.
The study shows that  a mother's sensitivity to her baby
is the most significant predictor of attachment security.  While
it is obviously better for a baby to have a sensitive, well-adjusted
mother, even the presence of an insensitive mother is important
for her baby's attachment security.  Moreover, high quality
care does not eradicate a baby's need for extensive time
with his mother even when  she is relatively unresponsive to his
cues and bids for attention.  In fact, for the insensitive mother
and her child, the NICHD  study affirms the value of part-time
over full-time employment.  Additionally, it  found  that a mother's
attitudes toward employment are crucial in terms of her baby's
attachment security.

<p>

But does this NICHD study categorically
endorse &quot;other care&quot; for babies as the media would
have us believe?  Does it relieve the employed mother's
guilt?  Are we to assume that placing babies in early and extensive
child care carries no significant risk?  As we ponder the findings
of the NICHD study, we need to remember that those researchers
have looked at only one aspect of child development -- attachment.
They have yet to examine children's development in terms
of aggression, social skills, health, capacity for empathy or
intellectual competence.  These qualities will be examined when
the children are 3 and 4 years old.  Since aggression is well
established by age 3 and has been one of the long-term effects
of early and extensive child care, the researchers may find that
the insecurely attached children in this  study are more likely
to be disobedient to adults and bully their peers.  Or they may
not.  Unfortunately, it will be several years before we learn
what these early and provocative findings mean.

<p>

As Belsky said when interviewed,
&quot;It's too early to tell. In my early observations,
lots of child care posed a risk factor. In this study, even more
than 10 hours of care was important. It's the most vulnerable
children who are the most adversely affected.&quot;  In terms
of policy implications, he added, &quot;To presume that the
data carry policy implications at this point is to make decisions
after reading the first chapter of a novel.&quot;  Then changing
his image, Belsky said, &quot;The study shows it's drizzling
now.  It could be a cloud cover or it could be the leading edge
of a storm. We just don't know.&quot;

<p>

As we await later results, we would
do well to look beyond the realm of social science research  to
the cultural landscape where we find other evidence -- disquieting
evidence -- that also merits our consideration.  The indicators
are that children in this country are not faring well.  Increasingly,
we read about acts of rage and violence committed by young children
-- children seemingly without a conscience.  For example, a 6-year-old
boy was recently arrested in Richmond, California, for the attempted
murder of a 6-month-old baby.  (Ironically, his mother works in
a child care agency.)  In Englewood, Colorado, a 10-year-old boy
is being held for fatally beating a 19-month-old girl he was babysitting.
In Lucerne Valley, California, two boys and girls, ages 11 and
12, were arrested for attempting to murder their teacher.[23] Whence
this anger and rage?  How can we begin to understand such violence
in the hearts of some of our nation's children except in
the context of their intimate parental attachments?

<p>

As we continue to make our daily
decisions about how best to rear our very young children and attempt
to understand the results of  scientific study, it may be that
we are doing so, not in a drizzle or even in a storm, but in the
all-too-quiet eye of a hurricane.
