IT'S TIME TO FREE THE ARTS</H2>

<I>Robert H. Knight</I></CENTER>
<P>
After years of debate and attempted reform, it has become clear
that the National Endowment for the Arts is beyond reclamation
and should be zero-budgeted by the 104th Congress. 
<P>
Particularly with regard to the visual arts (drawing, painting
and sculpting) and &quot;performance&quot; arts (theater, film,
live acts), the NEA has been a platform for attacks on religion,
traditional art forms, traditional families and traditional values,
and a forum for the promotion of homosexuality.  In the name of
tolerance, it has shown increasing intolerance toward standards
of any kind, including ordinary standards of artistic skill. 
Its peer review process has long been a buddy system for awarding
grants to colleagues, friends and clients of panel members, who
are almost uniformly hostile to traditional culture.   
<P>
However, even if the federal agency did manage to clean up its
act, the entire idea of government sponsorship of art is a bad
one.  Whenever the government decides to subsidize one artist
and not another, the government, in effect, determines what is
art and what is not.
<P>
Unlike any other arts sponsor, the federal government has unique
authority and responsibility.  Its powers derive from its claim
to represent all Americans and its money from mandatory taxes.
 NEA grants greatly influence what is presented in museums and
theaters and what private donors feel is worthy of support.  As
former NEA Chairman John Frohnmayer noted: &quot;Our grantees
state unequivocally that fund-raising is substantially easier
because of an Endowment grant.  It is an endorsement -- a mark
of quality and achievement.&quot;[1]
<P>
And what has the NEA done with this awesome responsibility? 
<P>
Since its founding, the NEA has openly favored the avant-garde
-- defined by <I>Webster's Third New International Unabridged
Dictionary</I> as: &quot;Those who 
create, produce or apply new, original or experimental ideas,
designs, techniques...and sometimes: a group that is extremist,
bizarre, or arty and affected.&quot;[2]  Unfortunately, the NEA seems
to have taken the latter portion of the definition to heart. 
There is a place, of course, for experimental art, but it should
be funded privately, not by taxpayers whose money often is used
to disparage their most deeply held beliefs.
<P>
As a federal agency, the NEA should not be fostering a bias toward
one particular art style over another.  In fact its own grant
guidelines specifically forbid it to do so or attempt to direct
artistic content.[3]
<P>
One reason the NEA has been able to promote bad art without public
scrutiny is that the media are not telling the whole story.  TV
broadcasters and newspapers are restrained by the bounds of good
taste from reproducing the most offensive works funded by the
NEA.  A January 2, 1991 <I>Los Angeles Times </I>article about
an NEA grant to performance artist Karen Finley described her
work only as &quot;strongly feminist in tone.&quot;[4] This leaves
the impression that Finley, who calls herself the &quot;Queen
of Dung,&quot; is controversial merely for being a feminist, not
because of her vulgarities.  
<P>
Because of this kind of obfuscation, most Americans have only
an abstract concept of the works in question.  Senator Jesse Helms,
the NEA's most active critic, has offered to debate the issue
on any TV network providing he can show viewers what is being
debated.  All have refused.  And for good reason.  If NBC-TV actually
aired some NEA-funded works, it would violate Federal Communications
Commission rules against obscenity and risk losing its broadcasting
license.  One federal agency would find itself prosecuting a company
for displaying materials sponsored by another federal agency.
<P>
<H3><CENTER>THE CHAIRMAN'S VIEWS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Under the chairmanship of actress Jane Alexander, the NEA has
not curbed its hostility toward traditional values.  In fact,
Alexander told the homosexual magazine <I>The Advocate</I> that
she intended to use the NEA to &quot;introduce people gently to
gay themes all across the country. And I mean gently, because
if you start with a kind of very overt thing, people get scared....
 You gently bring in gay people and introduce them to the world
through art.&quot;[5]
<P>
When asked, &quot;What sorts of grants would you reject out of
hand,&quot; Alexander answered: &quot;It's hard to say at this
point if there is any grant that I might reject.&quot;[6]
<P>
Indeed, Alexander later defended a performance in February 1994
at the NEA-funded Walker Art Center in Minneapolis in which an
HIV-positive performer, Ron Athey, sliced into another man's back
with a knife, mopped up the blood with towels and sent them on
clotheslines over the horrified audience.  He also had two female
assistants weave acupuncture needles through his own scalp and,
in turn, pierced the women's cheeks with steel spikes.[7]
<P>
Asked by a reporter what she thought of the performance, Alexander
replied that she trusted the judgment of the Walker management,
and said, &quot;Not all art is for everybody....  Americans are
certainly not used to seeing bloodletting, except in films, and
when it happens in person, it must be surprising.&quot;  Alexander
added that she thought &quot;all appropriate precautions&quot;
regarding health had been taken, &quot;So what are we left with
that was considered controversial?  The sacrification [sic], the
ritual-like aspect?  Is it that the man is homosexual?&quot;[8]
<P>
Congress responded to Alexander's lack of action by cutting $4
million from the NEA budget.  Athey then performed his act at
another NEA-funded theater, New York's P.S. 122.  &quot;With full
knowledge of this,&quot; culture critics David Horowitz and Laurence
Jarvik note, &quot;The NEA again funded both P.S. 122 and the
Walker Art Center in the most recent grant cycle.  Plainly, the
agency is deaf to the concerns of Congress and the public.&quot;[9]
<P>
Some of the more serious problems[10] at the NEA include:
<P>
- Bias against religion; rejecting positive portrayals of religion
as violating the separation of church and state, but funding attacks
on religion as &quot;artistic expression&quot;;
<P>
- Elevation of &quot;freedom of expression&quot; and &quot;artistic
merit&quot; as the main criteria for grants, ignoring the NEA's
charter legislation of 1965, which set &quot;encouragement of
excellence&quot; as the No. 1 criterion, followed by &quot;access
to the arts for all Americans&quot;;  
<P>
- Confusion in upper management about how to comply with congressionally-mandated
standards;
<P>
- Confusion about the NEA's primary mission;
<P>
- Conflicts of interest in the grant-awarding process;
<P>
- A bureaucracy openly hostile to public scrutiny;
<P>
- Bias against traditional forms of art and traditional values
in general.
<P>
<H3><CENTER>HOSTILITY TOWARD RELIGION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The First Amendment prohibits Congress (and federal agencies authorized
by Congress) to infringe on religious liberties.  It is clearly
unconstitutional to use federal tax dollars to create and distribute
an attack on religious beliefs.  The government has no business
dictating the value of religious beliefs or prescribing changes
in them. 
<P>
Yet the taxpayer-supported NEA over the years has funded works
that degrade or mock religious belief, particularly Christianity.
<P>
- In June, 1993, the Whitney Museum of American Art, which received
$200,000 from the NEA during 1992-1993, displayed <I>Abject Art:
Repulsion and Desire in American Art</I>.  The exhibit's journal
explains the focus: &quot;Although 'abject art' is a play on 'object
art,' the term does not connote an art movement so much as it
describes a body of work which incorporates or suggests abject
materials such as dirt, hair, excrement, dead animals, menstrual
blood, and rotting food in order to confront taboo issues of gender
and sexuality....  Employing methodologies adapted from feminism,
queer theory, post-structuralism, Marxism, and psychoanalysis,
our goal is to talk dirty in the institution [of art] and degrade
its atmosphere of purity and prudery by foregrounding issues of
gender and sexuality in the art exhibited.&quot;[11]
<P>
The Whitney show included works by Joel-Peter Witkin, who received
four fellowship grants from the NEA: Fiscal year 1980, $3,000;
FY 1981 $12,500; FY 1986, $15,000; FY 1992, $20,000.[12] Witkin's
work includes &quot;Maquette for Crucifix,&quot; a naked Jesus
Christ surrounded by sado-masochistic obscene imagery, and many
grotesque portrayals of corpses and body parts.  Another Whitney
exhibit was a film by Suzie Silver titled &quot;A Spy,&quot; which
depicts Jesus Christ as a woman standing naked with breasts exposed.
 The Whitney also included &quot;Piss Christ,&quot; Andres Serrano's
photograph of a crucifix in a jar of urine, and a film by porn
star Annie Sprinkle titled &quot;The Sluts and Goddesses Video
Workshop or How to be a Sex Goddess in 101 Easy Steps.&quot;[13] Sprinkle
has performed numerous times in NEA-funded venues such as Highways
in Los Angeles and The Kitchen Theater in New York, where she
has had audience members come on stage to examine her exposed
genitals.
<P>
- Diamanda Galas, who was The Kitchen Theater's first artist-in-residence,
performed &quot;Plague Mass&quot; at the Cathedral of St. John
the Divine in Manhattan in 1990, during which she appeared topless
and covered with blood.[14] A member of ACT-UP, the AIDS activist
group, she was arrested during a demonstration at St. Patrick's
Cathedral in New York in 1989.[15] On July 8, 1993, she opened the
Serious Fun Festival at Lincoln Center, which was supported by
a $14,700 dance grant from the NEA.[16] As the New York Times explains,
&quot;Conceptually, her work is close to that of the late David
Wojnarowicz, the visual artist-writer who died of AIDS in 1992.&quot;
 In 1990, the NEA gave a $15,000 grant to Wojnarowicz, who specialized
in photographs of men performing oral sex, anal sex, anal-oral
sex and masturbation.  An essay in one of his exhibits described
New York's John Cardinal O'Connor as &quot;a fat cannibal from
that house of walking swastikas up on fifth avenue,&quot; and
a &quot;creep in black skirts.&quot;[17]
<P>
- Anti-Christian material is distributed through the NEA-supported
Video Data Bank at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.[18]
The following are a couple of the offerings, with descriptions
cited from &quot;Gay and Lesbian Tapes Distributed by the Video
Data Bank&quot;:
<P>
<I>Popular Thought</I>.  This video equates the &quot;moral majority&quot;
with totalitarianism.  &quot;UThe message reverberates with the
interweaving of archival footage of Nazi Youth, book burnings
and modern day Ohio Youth for Jesus creating an audiovisual fabric
of hatredU -- Carole Ann Klonarides.&quot;
<P>
<I>Peccatum Mutum (The Silent Sin)</I>.  &quot;...explores relationships
among cloistered nuns....  Utilizing gothic expressionistic sets,
humor, serious kissing, and melodrama, this work expresses the
contradictions and ironic similarities between physical desire
and spiritual fervor.  A rare glimpse at the other side of Catholic
guilt.&quot;
<P>
<H3><CENTER>TARGETING THE FAMILY</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Promotion of &quot;alternative lifestyles&quot; has long been
a staple of NEA grants.  A case in point is, again, NEA support
of the Video Data Bank, which offers these films and accompanying
synopses:[19]
<P>
- <I>Swamp</I>.  &quot;This subversive soap opera targets the
family, psychotherapy and property as the villains.&quot;
<P>
- <I>A Coalminer's Granddaughter</I>.  &quot;This hysterically
funny epic about a brutally realistic American family does for
lesbians what John Waters did for Baltimore....  Under the thumb
of her sleazy, evil father (brilliantly portrayed by novelist
Kevin Killian) Jane is not the hero of her own life....  <I>Coal
Miner's Granddaughter</I> opens up into the impressionistic world
of her sexuality...highly charged sexuality [that makes] staples
of lesbian erotica seem tepid and silly.&quot;
<P>
- <I>Talk to Me Like the Rain</I>.  &quot;...two brothers whose
incestuous behavior feeds a disillusionment in the trust and faith
with one another [sic].&quot;
<P>
- <I>Stephen</I>.  &quot;This production focuses on the story
of siblings and, in this case, twins locked in a complex, emotional
and sexual relationship....  In the end, the expectations of both
religion and a modern world are abandoned....&quot;
<P>
- <I>The A Ha! Experience</I>.  &quot;...explores the erotic elements
of mother-infant intimacy that are repeated in the oedipal devaluation
of the mother, the object of desire for the daughter.&quot;
<P>
<H3><CENTER>PROMOTING HOMOSEXUALITY</H3></CENTER>
<P>
By validating the pro-homosexual viewpoint through taxpayer-supported
government grants, the NEA has helped legitimize pro-homosexual
theater in general.  <I>New York Newsday</I> arts critic Linda
Winer notes that: &quot;The fact is, much of the theater these
days is gay....  Indeed, much of it has been for a very long time....
 This season there have been so many gay projects that I've been
searching for an alternative to the term 'straight play' when
describing a nonmusical.&quot;[20]
<P>
NEA-funded venues such as The Woolly Mammoth Theatre in Washington,
D.C., The Franklin Furnace and The Kitchen in New York, Highways
in Los Angeles, and countless other NEA-funded theater groups
around the country present works promoting homosexuality and blasting
traditional morality.  The NEA also supports pro-homosexual projects
shown on the Public Broadcasting System.  Some recent examples
of pro-homosexual, NEA-supported works:
<P>
- In April, 1994, Woolly Mammoth staged NEA grant recipient Tim
Miller's one-man performance, &quot;My Queer Body,&quot; in which
he, among other things, describes what it's like to have sex with
another man, climbs naked into the lap of a spectator, and finally
arouses himself sexually in full view of the audience.[21]
<P>
- In January, 1994, the Public Broadcasting Service showed <I>Tales
of the City</I>, a three-part miniseries celebrating homosexual
life in San Francisco in the 1970s.  The series was full of gratuitous
nudity, crudity, lewdness and dozens of instances of foul language.
 Families are lampooned and homosexuality is portrayed as superior.
 The series was co-produced by American Playhouse, which received
$750,000 in NEA funds in 1993.  NEA received an on-screen credit
as a supporter of the film. 
<P>
- In August 1994, the Public Broadcasting Service aired <I>One
Nation Under God</I>, a misleading, one-sided documentary by two
homosexual activists that attempts to discredit ex-gay therapy
and counseling.[22] The NEA is credited as a main sponsor for the
film, which links Christian ministries to Nazi techniques such
as shock/aversion therapy, a practice which has long been denounced
by the ex-gay movement.  The film misportrays several homosexual
activists, misrepresents Evelyn Hooker's psychological studies
of homosexual men in the 1950's, and uses Biblical references
out of context.  The film also takes quotes from several therapists
and former homosexuals out of context.  In one clip, a former
homosexual explains that he used to think that &quot;God hates
homosexuals,&quot; but that he now knows that God loves them.
 The filmmakers include only the fragment, &quot;God hates homosexuals,&quot;
reversing the man's intended meaning.  Dr. Elizabeth Moberly,
author of <I>Psychogenesis</I> and founder of a Pennsylvania-based,
ex-gay ministry, says the filmmakers misrepresented themselves,
took her out of context in her taped interview and distorted severely
what she and other therapists had said.[23] The film was shown at
several gay and lesbian film festivals during the summer of 1994
and at the 1995 Gay Games and Cultural Festival in New York City.
 Over the years, the NEA has supported several gay and lesbian
film festivals, which have presented hard-core pornography and
anti-religious themes.[24]
<P>
- The NEA-supported Video Data Bank at the School of the Art Institute
of Chicago offers numerous homosexual films.  <I>Danny</I>, a
20-minute documentary, includes footage touting &quot; Uthe raw
sensuality of cruising and anonymous encountersU -- Robert Rosenberg,
Global Village.&quot;  <I>Jollies</I> is an 11-minute film by
Sadie Benning, who &quot;recounts her earliest sexual encounters.&quot;
 Another Benning work, <I>Me and Rubyfruit</I>, &quot;chronicles
the enchantment of teenage lesbian love.&quot;  Other titles in
the catalog are frankly pornographic.   
<P>
<H3><CENTER>TALKING POINTS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B>Curbing the NEA would amount to censorship, and that's against
the First Amendment, isn't it?</B>
<P>
The First Amendment to the Constitution states that &quot;Congress
shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or
prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom
of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peacefully
to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.&quot;
<P>
The Constitution limits the federal government and, by extension
of the 14th Amendment, the states, from censoring protected speech,
as defined over the years by Supreme Court cases.  It does not
limit individual citizens nor private groups, which have freedom
to maintain their own standards of decency and their own viewpoints.
 The issue is one of sponsorship, not censorship.  There is no
constitutional &quot;right&quot; of an artist to a subsidy from
his fellow taxpayers.  
<P>
<B>But won't the arts collapse without federal aid?</B>
<P>
More than $9 billion in private giving sustains arts in communities
all over America.[25} The NEA's $175 million is important more for
its symbolism than for the actual dollars involved.   An NEA grant
validates an artist, and the government should not be in the business
of determining what is art.  That process smacks of &quot;official&quot;
art, such as is imposed on the artistic communities in totalitarian
societies.
<P>
<B>Can the NEA be reformed?</B>
<P>
No, it can't.  Congress has tried several times to rein in the
rogue agency, including appointing an independent commission to
study the NEA in 1990.  With some fanfare, the NEA adopted a few
reforms, but continued to fund the worst excesses in the art world.
 Even after Congress slightly cut the NEA's budget in 1994 as
a message of discontent, it continued to shovel money to artists
whose primary purpose is to insult the majority of taxpayers.
 Also, NEA officials consistently have displayed an arrogant disregard
for the taxpayers.  Even a pro-reform arts critic, the late Samuel
Lipman, who had been a member of the National Council on the Arts
during the 1980s, finally came to the conclusion in the 1990s
that the agency was irreparable and should be abolished.
<P>
<B>Besides ending subsidies for bad art, are there any other reasons
to defund NEA?</B>
<P>
Yes.  The federal deficit is out of control, so Congress must
find ways to cut back without endangering infrastructure.  Before
1965, the United States got along just fine without federal art
subsidies, which are a product of the Great Society's massive
government expansion.   Also, NEA funds are distributed in a grossly
distorted fashion, with certain areas such as New York, Los Angeles
and Minnesota receiving far more money than other states and cities.
 And many grants go to artists who are already successful and
do not need the money.  Finally, ending federal subsidies would
put a dent in cultural imperialism; pampered artists could no
longer use the federal government to tell the rest of the nation
what is art and what isn't.  Pulling the plug on NEA money would
mean that communities would support the arts that the people in
those communities wanted -- not the art that is dictated from
Washington, D.C.

Over the past decade, the federal government has spent billions
of dollars on HIV research, which has been geared predominantly
toward end-stage HIV (full-blown AIDS).  In Fiscal Year 1995,
the U.S. Public Health Service will spend $2.7 billion directly
on AIDS, the highest expenditure for any of the nation's 10 most
lethal diseases.[1]
<P>
AIDS ranks near the bottom of the list of the top 10 mortal diseases
and accounts for about 35,000 deaths annually.  Heart disease
claims 720,000 lives annually, and cancer kills 505,000.  Yet
the federal government will spend more on AIDS than on heart disease
($828 million) and cancer ($2.4 billion).[2]
<P>
The point is not that AIDS should cease receiving attention. 
HIV is a contagious disease and its victims deserve compassion
and help.  Funding should continue for treatment, prevention and
care.  However, AIDS funding must be brought into line with expenditures
for other life-threatening diseases, and the money must be redirected
toward more effective approaches.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>A CHANGING EPIDEMIC</CENTER></H3>
<P>
The scourge of AIDS, which began in America among white, male
homosexuals, has moved into poor, minority communities, driven
by prostitution, drug abuse and promiscuous sex.  Yet most AIDS
funding is still directed by, for and to the original target population.
<P>
AIDS funding generally is allocated according to the numbers of
people who ever have contracted AIDS -- including those who already
have died -- not those currently diagnosed with HIV.  This formula
has, for example, directed money to white, homosexual AIDS groups
in San Francisco while cities which now may have greater numbers
of HIV-infected patients get less financial aid.  The CDC has
reported that 55 percent of AIDS cases in 1993 came from minority
communities, with blacks having the worst rate of all the groups.[3]
Black women were approximately 15 times more likely than white
women to get AIDS, and black men were five times more likely to
get AIDS than white men.[4]
<P>
For many years, AIDS policy has been driven by the demands of
HIV-infected people who dominate AIDS organizations.  Their situations
are tragic, and their focus on finding a cure is understandable.
 But because of their considerable influence, the lion's share
of AIDS funding has been spent for treatment of end-stage HIV
(AIDS) and not on the full spectrum of HIV disease. 
<P>
Even the prevention efforts have been tailored toward protecting
the identities of those with HIV rather than toward measures that
have proven effective in stemming other serious epidemics.  Much
government time at AIDS conferences has been spent on perfecting
&quot;nonjudgmental&quot; vernacular, such as substituting &quot;people
living with HIV&quot; for the word &quot;victim&quot; or even
the word &quot;patient&quot; in order to reduce stigma.  In the
same vein, concern for confidentiality, while important, has been
overemphasized, and sound medical procedures have been thwarted
and often ignored.  The first step in stopping an epidemic is
identifying, on a confidential basis, those who have the disease.
 This process has been hampered by federally-funded AIDS activists,
who have defeated efforts to increase early diagnosis and confidential
partner notification, the surest ways to pinpoint the disease
and to help check its spread. 
<P>
Furthermore, the federal government's preventative response to
the epidemic has consisted largely of a million-dollar ad campaign
promoting condoms and hundreds of millions of dollars for AIDS
education that targets schoolchildren, acquainting them with graphic
materials explaining the various ways AIDS is transmitted, whether
they are at risk or not.  At the same time, populations that are
most at risk for HIV transmission are under-served, particularly
in black or Hispanic communities.
<P>
The current premise of many AIDS prevention efforts is that <I>uninfected</I>
persons have primary responsibility for stemming the epidemic,
not those already infected.  The focus must be changed to make
personal responsibility on the part of those infected the foundation
of future programs. 
<P>
The most successful AIDS eradication program in America has been
run by the U.S. armed forces.  Early diagnosis is the key.  Since
1985, every member of the military has been screened regularly
for HIV, resulting in a depth of knowledge about the disease that
is unparalleled.  Unlike civilian doctors, military medical personnel
are not &quot;flying blind&quot; in this epidemic and are getting
early treatment and notification to those affected.  There is
no &quot;AIDS epidemic&quot; in the military because aggressive
knowledge-based intervention prevents the spread of disease.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>IDEAS FOR POLICY MAKERS</CENTER></H3>
<P>
Here are some proposals to overhaul federal AIDS programs, with
thanks to Americans for a Sound AIDS/HIV Policy, a nonpartisan
Washington, D.C.-based research and advocacy group, for their
wise counsel on several of these points: 
<P>
<LI><B>Initiate prenatal HIV testing for all pregnant women</B>,
with an opt-out for those who want it.  Twenty-six percent of
HIV-infected mothers transmit the disease to their babies today
in the United States.  However, mothers who do not know they are
HIV-positive can unwittingly transmit it to the 74 percent of
uninfected babies by breast-feeding.  Furthermore, research shows
that when HIV-infected mothers are treated with the drug AZT,
the transmission rate drops from 26 percent to 8 percent.  Thus
knowledge of HIV status can save many lives.
<P>
<LI><B>Begin HIV partner notification programs in all 50 states,
the District of Columbia and U.S. territories</B>.  Partner tracing
is the fastest way to alert those in danger of infection and is
standard public health procedure for virtually all contagious
and sexually transmitted diseases.  Earlier this century, epidemics
of gonorrhea and syphilis were greatly reduced using this time-proven
procedure. 
<P>
<LI><B>Guarantee confidentiality to all who are tested.</B>  Concern
over misuse of HIV status has been the main obstacle to effective
testing programs.  But public health departments have reported
more than 400,000 cases of AIDS to the CDC without a single breach
of confidentiality in any of the 50 states.  Moreover, venereal
disease testing has been done for years without any serious breach-of-confidentiality problem. 
<P>
<LI><B>Overhaul the Ryan White Act</B>, which dispenses about $650
million annually in federal funds.  The Ryan White Act is due
to expire in 1995.  Hearings need to be held to examine how the
money is being spent.  And the spending formulas should include
the following changes:
<P>
1) Only those infected with HIV or AIDS who need care should receive
benefits.  Formulas based on &quot;AIDS prevalence&quot; distort
funding needs because they count the dead along with the living.
 Money ought to go where it is needed most, which is, increasingly,
to under-served minority communities.
<P>
2) People with HIV or AIDS should qualify where they are currently
living, not where they were diagnosed.  Slating funds to areas
of diagnosis misses areas where AIDS patients are actually residing.
 For example, someone might be diagnosed with AIDS in a large
city, but return home to a suburban or rural area for care.
<P>
3) Means testing for AIDS care dollars should be introduced. 
Those with adequate insurance should not be in the same pool with
those who truly have no other means of payment.
<P>
<LI><B>Overhaul HIV/AIDS education</B>, which now emphasizes condoms
and has not been shown to be effective.  In fact, programs seeking
funding renewal should be required to show evidence that they
have reduced HIV transmission. 
<P>
Sex education should be geared toward abstinence education and
knowledge of HIV status.  True abstinence programs (not those
that merely mention abstinence and then focus on contraception)
are the only sex education programs that have been proven to alter
behavior in positive ways.  &quot;Comprehensive&quot; (contraceptive-based)
programs have been proven to have either no effect or to actually
encourage earlier or more frequent sexual experimentation.  The
key to stopping AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases is
not in the promotion of condoms but in the promotion of delayed
sexual activity and early knowledge of infection.  In a recent
test, three groups of people were monitored: 1) a group who received
HIV education, 2) a control group with no HIV education and 3)
a group who received HIV education, and who also underwent an
HIV test.  Only the latter group registered any behavioral change.
 Testing in and of itself heightens consciousness of the seriousness
of premature or promiscuous sex.
<P>
The federal AIDS education campaign has emphasized condoms first
and has treated abstinence as a largely unrealistic goal, even
though medical experts agree that it is the most medically sound
response.  Condoms are seen by some as a way of continuing high-risk
behavior regardless of HIV status.  But no honest medical professional
would recommend that an uninfected person have sex with an HIV-infected
partner using a condom for protection.  Condoms can reduce the
risk in a single encounter, but not to where it is anywhere near
acceptable to be considered in the context of &quot;prevention.&quot;
<P>
The CDC has even misrepresented the concept of abstinence, stating
in its literature that there is a &quot;26 percent failure rate
for periodic abstinence.&quot;[5] What they are really describing
is &quot;periodic sex.&quot;  There is no such thing as &quot;periodic
abstinence.&quot;  To understand the absurdity of this statement,
try imagining the police describing a burglar as having a 26 percent
&quot;periodic honesty&quot; failure rate.  Funding for all federal
AIDS programs that promote condom use and misrepresent abstinence
should be halted immediately.  Sex education programs under Title
X (a program that was a colossal, $3 billion failure over two
decades) should be zeroed out.
<P>
<LI><B>Focus research on the &quot;full spectrum&quot; of HIV</B>,
from inception on, instead of merely focusing on HIV's final stage
(AIDS).  Dr. Robert Redfield of Walter Reed Hospital notes that
finding a &quot;cure&quot; for this tricky retrovirus is only
a distant possibility (and still a worthy goal), but that early
detection is the key to prevention.[6] Also, research subject pools
need to include more women and people from minority communities,
where the epidemic is increasing at the fastest rates.
<P>
<LI><B>Change the formula for the Centers for Disease Control's
prevention planning committees.</B> They are currently biased
toward white, homosexual men, although the HIV epidemic has shifted
toward minority communities.  Testing authorization should not
be limited to licensed phlebotomists but expanded to include small,
trained groups that can operate within minority communities inexpensively
and efficiently, using the Orasure saliva-test collection device
recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration.
<P>
<LI><B>Support distribution of the saliva-based HIV test</B>, approval
of which was held up for nearly four years by the FDA.  The test
is a reliable, inexpensive and convenient way to detect HIV. 
The sample is processed in a lab, so public health professionals
can track the epidemic when names are gained through confidential
testing.  Conversely, an<I> anonymous</I> home test backed by
AIDS activist groups would help &quot;drive the epidemic underground,&quot;
a concern voiced, ironically, by those same groups whenever the
testing issue is raised.  Anonymous home tests would discourage
people from being tested in a manner that fosters early counseling
and treatment and that could be tracked by public health professionals,
and it would severely limit the impact of partner-notification
programs that are under way in many states.  Furthermore, the
trauma of discovering that one has HIV infection, experienced
alone, could lead some to suicide. 
<P>
Although concerns of confidentiality are not to be taken lightly,
the idea of anonymous HIV testing is being driven by the notion
that the primary responsibility for the epidemic should fall on
those who are uninfected, not on those who have the virus.  
<P>
<LI><B>Require routine testing of patients and health care workers.
</B> Both parties should be notified of the results.  Ignorance
of infection has never aided the cause of good medical care. 
In many cases, women do not show early signs of HIV infection,
and the first indication comes when the patient is actually dying
of AIDS.  
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CONCLUSION</CENTER></H3>
<P>
In testimony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in
1991, Dr. Robert Redfield said, &quot;The chilling reality is
that the AIDS epidemic of the next decade has already occurred.
 Central to the military response was the recognition of HIV infection
for what it is -- a sexually transmitted, progressively fatal
infection, which, although not yet curable, is treatable and preventable.&quot;
<P>
The AIDS epidemic of the year 2000, indeed, has occurred already.
 In fact, it took place around 1990.  The HIV virus' incubation
period typically takes 10 years, so when public policy makers
are addressing full-blown AIDS in 1995, they are dealing with
behavior and causes that occurred in 1985.  While care of AIDS
patients and basic AIDS research is essential, prevention efforts
need to be targeted toward current patterns of behavior and the
current population groups most adversely affected.  Homosexual
white males still account for the largest number of AIDS cases,
but the growth in HIV infections increasingly is among poor, black
and Hispanic urban dwellers, including women.  It's time to gear
the federal AIDS effort toward sound, time-tested medical procedures
such as early diagnosis, reporting and confidential partner notification,
and it's time to make individual responsibility the touchstone
of public policy.

Authorization for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting is due
to expire at the end of 1996.  But Congress must appropriate money
each year.  The new 104th Congress should decline to do so. 
<P>
There is no reason Congress should force the taxpayers to continue
subsidizing this outdated system, much of which (the best parts)
would survive nicely without federal aid.
<P>
The CPB, overseer of the Public Broadcasting Service and National
Public Radio, was created in 1967 to meet a perceived need for
taxpayer-financed alternative programming not provided by commercial
networks.  That need, if there ever was one, has passed.  The
advent of cable television, satellite dishes and improved radio
technology has created an enormous menu of broadcasting choices
for consumers.  America has more than 11,700 radio stations and
more than 3,100 television licensees, plus 109 cable networks[1]
and another 6,963 translators and boosters, which extend the reach
of existing stations.[2] In addition, computer technology has created
a multitude of interactive computer highways, such as the Internet.
 It is not as if consumers don't have enough access to information.
<P>
The basis for CPB's existence has always been an anti-free market
philosophy.   Proponents have said that the market is incapable
of providing good programming, so the government must step in
and do it, to the tune of $285.6 million annually.[3] This insults
the intelligence of the viewing/listening public, because it assumes
they won't appreciate or support good programming.  Yet the shows
that register high ratings on PBS turn out to be the very programs
that the public perceives to be excellent: <I>Sesame Street</I>,
<I>Barney and Friends</I>, <I>The MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour</I>,
and <I>Masterpiece Theatre</I>, for example.  All of these shows
are generating more than sufficient revenue from sponsors, donors,
grants and product marketing.  They do not need taxpayer subsidies.
But there is other CPB programming that probably would fail to
attract a sufficient viewing/listening audience or donor support.
 These programs are so bad that their creators must dig into the
public purse.  Subsidizing bad art is a donor's prerogative, of
course -- unless the &quot;donor&quot; is the taxpayer, who has
no choice.  
<P>
In a time of massive federal deficits, it makes no sense to require
taxpayers to shell out their hard-earned dollars for art of any
kind.  And the CPB, like any government bureaucracy, has waste
built into it.  A Congressional Conference Report on the Public
Broadcasting Service discloses that &quot;a single individual
is paid $438,000 annually for his once a week 30 minute appearance.&quot;[4]
<P>
It also makes no sense when cable television and satellites are
providing hundreds of programming alternatives.  Anything that
is worth viewing on PBS, for instance, would be picked up by Bravo,
The Learning Channel, the Arts &amp; Entertainment Network and
other channels. 
<P>
Public broadcasting advocates acknowledge that major PBS and NPR
stations would continue to thrive without federal subsidies. 
Their concern, they say, is that smaller, rural stations would
be forced to close.  But rural radio listeners or TV viewers can
tune in to numerous commercial stations or even to National Public
Radio or Public Broadcasting Service stations in distant cities
merely by acquiring better equipment.  Would it really be a great
loss if rural folks were denied the ability to see <I>Tongues
Untied</I> on their own, local station? Living in the country
has its own rewards, but forcing other taxpayers to subsidize
money-losing operations and bad art should not be one of them.
<P>
Besides, there is no public clamor from rural people or suburbanites
or urban dwellers, for that matter, to continue to subsidize the
pet projects (and paychecks) of a small radical elite that is
at odds with most American values.  The case for CPB subsidies
is being made almost exclusively by those in &quot;the arts community&quot;
and radical political activists who stand to benefit directly
from taxpayer largesse.  A case in point is a recent letter from
Independent Television Service Executive Director James Yee to
public broadcasting advocates.  The taxpayer-supported (and, therefore,
in no way independent) ITVS was created in 1988 to provide new
programming for public broadcasting.  Yee urges his &quot;independent
colleagues&quot; to &quot;become involved in future efforts to
drum up support for public broadcasting, especially with your
local and national elected officials, local public broadcasting
station(s), media arts organizations, and civic and cultural institutions.&quot;[5]
Yee warned that &quot;an extensive informational outreach campaign
will have to be waged,&quot;[6] which means newspapers and broadcasters
will begin pelting their audiences with scary stories about the
demise of Big Bird, should budget cutters prevail.   
<P>
But the debate over CPB is not about grounding Big Bird.  Through
PBS and NPR, the CPB is peddling a political and social agenda
that is offensive to many.  For example, NPR reporter Sunni Khalid
revealed more than a bit of political bias when commenting on
the Republican Congressional victory during a C-Span <I>Journalists
Roundtable</I> (C-Span is not funded by CPB, but by America's
cable TV operators): &quot;I think there's a big difference when
people told Father Aristide to sort of moderate his views, they
were concerned about people being dragged through the streets,
killed and necklaced.  I don't think that is what [House Speaker]
Newt Gingrich has in mind.  I think he's looking at a more scientific,
a more civil way, of lynching people.&quot;[7]
<P>
The bright side is that few folks are tuning in to public broadcasting's
truly awful programs.   The bad side is that their money is being
used to produce shows that are used to validate attacks on them,
and then the same shows are foisted, in videocassettes, on unsuspecting
schoolchildren as &quot;educational&quot; supplements. 
<P>
Here are a few of the anti-family, anti-religious, pro-homosexual
offerings from public broadcasting in recent years:
<P>
<CENTER><H3>ANTI-FAMILY PROGRAMMING</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<LI>In July 1994, a mother in Akron, Ohio, was shocked to find a
program titled <I>What if I'm Gay</I> sandwiched between <I>Kidsongs
TV</I> and <I>Sesame Street</I> from 10:00 to 11:00 a.m. on her
local PBS station.  The mother's concern about placing such programming
at a time when many pre-school children and toddlers are watching
T.V. seems to have been largely ignored by the station.  After
the woman called the station to complain, the programming director
defended the show, saying, &quot;The quality of the program is
unquestionable.  It has good
writing and production and is well thought out.&quot;[8]
<P>
<LI>The Independent Television Service (ITVS) has been awarded more
than $38 million in public broadcasting funds since 1989.  For
that princely sum, according to public media watchdog <I>COMINT</I>
magazine, the public has received a mere nine hours of programming.
Perhaps this is a blessing, given ITVS's focus.  One five-hour
series called <I>Television Families,</I> for which ITVS (through
the taxpayers) ponied up $1.9 million, plans to feature &quot;tales
of more or less dysfunctional families&quot; which &quot;all fall
outside the mainstream.&quot; ITVS earlier had announced that
it is seeking programs that will &quot;test the boundaries, both
of form and content, that have defined the family's role on television.&quot;
 These include &quot;new alternative households, new patterns
for adoption and birth...new articulations of rights for children.&quot;
<P>
The anti-family agenda in this case is obvious.  It incorporates
and goes beyond <I>Murphy Brown's</I> glorification of single
motherhood.  The term &quot;alternative households&quot; is often
used to describe homosexual households and other non-traditional
households, putting them on the same moral plane as traditional
families.  &quot;New patterns for adoption and birth&quot; are
terms used to describe adoption of children by homosexuals and
artificial insemination.  &quot;Children's rights&quot; is the
anti-parent philosophy in which the state knows best when it comes
to handing out condoms, referring children to abortionists and
otherwise undermining the authority of parents. 
<P>
Another ITVS offering is <I>Dottie Gets Spanked</I>, a mockery
of 1950s American family life from the producer of the cult homosexual
films <I>Superstar</I> and <I>Poison</I>.  Yet another is <I>Terminal
USA</I>, described by the ITVS newsletter <I>Buzzwords</I> as
being about &quot;wholly unwholesome folks&quot; who &quot;cram
a lot of skeletons in their closet: drug abuse, homosexuality,
teen pregnancy, elderly abuse, unemployment, and infidelity (with
the pizza delivery boy) -- all under one roof.&quot; Making a
gratuitous slam on conservative Christians, <I>Buzzwords</I> concludes:
&quot;Unlike the absolute 'family values' of censorship-minded
evangelicals, <I>TV Families</I> values all kinds of families.&quot;[9]
<P>
<LI>In May of 1992 PBS broadcast a documentary called <I>What Kids
Want to Know About Sex and Growing Up</I>.  Produced by the Children's
Television Workshop, the show was an attack on traditional family
values in the guise of a pseudo-scientific presentation. 
<P>
The program contains graphic sexual information, aimed at children
as young as 8 years old.  Children are encouraged to use condoms
without being informed about high condom failure rates.  Abstinence
is given only a passing mention.  Parents are nearly invisible,
as are clergy or any other adults who would normally articulate
moral and familial ramifications of sexuality. 
<P>
Having a baby is illustrated through an exercise in which teens
carry around a bag of flour for a week and then talk about how
it cramps their style.  This exercise fails to take into account
the joys of parenthood.  It dehumanizes babies and subordinates
life itself to the cold sexual imperative. 
<P>
None of the instructors use the word &quot;marriage&quot; in any
context.  Sex is portrayed strictly as a physical act, without
the larger moral and social contexts that constitute the real
&quot;facts of life.&quot;  &quot;Husbands&quot; and &quot;wives&quot;
are not mentioned, just &quot;partners.&quot; This video is now
available in commercial video stores.
<P>
<LI>Children's Television Workshop also publishes <I>Sesame Street
Parents</I> magazine, which features an advice column by New York
University psychologist Lawrence Balter.   In the January/February
1994 issue, Dr. Balter advises parents that masturbation is a
&quot;tension-relieving activity that, much like hair twirling
and thumb-sucking, serves to soothe and calm children.  Masturbation
can also help a child learn more about his body and help him develop
positive attitudes toward sex....Avoid telling your son that touching
himself is 'not nice.'&quot;[10]
<P>
<LI>In 1992, the POV (Point of View) series began with <I>Color
Adjustment</I>, a documentary by homosexual writer and AIDS victim,
the late Marlon Riggs (see <I>Tongues Untied</I> item below),
who complained about the heterosexual bias of most family programming:
&quot;Have we exchanged the myths of pre-television America for
new fictions just as confining, for impossibly rigid, homogenized
fictions of the family, and the American dream....?&quot;[11]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>PRO-HOMOSEXUAL PROGRAMMING</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<LI>On January 5, 1995, National Public Radio's &quot;All Things
Considered&quot; ran what amounted to a promotion of homosexual
punk rock music, focusing on the new activist group Homocore.
 NPR reporter Rick Carr describes New York's Pansy Division as
&quot;one of hundreds of bands that infuse punk rock's do-it-yourself
aesthetic with gay themes.&quot;[12] 
<P>
<LI>In early 1994, PBS ran the miniseries <I>Tales of the City</I>,
a celebration of homosexuality in San Francisco during the 1970s.
 The series presents the homosexual lifestyle as superior to marriage
and family, with few apparent consequences from promiscuous sex
or illicit drugs.  The series is full of gratuitous nudity, crudity,
lewdness and foul language.  Traditional families are lampooned
through stereotypical caricatures of stupid fathers and meddling
mothers.  The only person dying from an incurable disease is a
heterosexual businessman who winds up cheating on his wife with
a transsexual.  Even an edited version of the series that ran
on Oklahoma public television caused a &quot;quite a bit of animosity
amongst a considerable number of legislators from rural areas,&quot;
Bob Allen of Oklahoma ETV told <I>Current</I>, a public broadcasting
trade journal.[13] The publication noted that <I>Tales</I> had also
drawn acclaim from critics and &quot;just about everywhere, local
outlets heard both praise and disapproval from viewers.&quot;[14]
<P>
<LI>In 1991, PBS aired a film documentary titled <I>Tongues Untied</I>.
 Written by ITVS grant recipient Marlon Riggs and shown under
the banner of POV, the documentary was so offensive that more
than 100 PBS stations refused to air it.  Still, many urban stations
did air the show, which contained full frontal nudity, bare buttocks
and 20 seconds of two men disrobing and having sex.
<P>
<LI>In June of 1992, PBS aired <I>The Lost Language of Cranes</I>
as part of Gay Pride Month.  The film features a father and son
&quot;coming out,&quot;  to declare their homosexuality.  The
movie also shows a man attempting to initiate anonymous sex with
a man in a homosexual porn theater.  Graphic scenes of homosexuals
kissing and engaging in sex are also featured.
<P>
Homosexual activists have acknowledged CPB's contribution to their
cause.  At a public hearing on CPB held in Washington, D.C. in
January 1994, Cathy Renna of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against
Defamation (GLAAD) congratulated CPB, which, she said, &quot;has
aired many documentaries, films, and series that have touched
on or dealt with gay issues.&quot; She urged CPB to &quot;continue
to bring as much gay-oriented programming as possible to the viewing
public without fear of reprisal or complaint.&quot;[15] At the same
hearing, Gregory King of the Human Rights Campaign Fund noted,
&quot;...the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, through your
support of National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting Service,
has had an important impact on the ability of lesbian and gay
Americans to emerge from the shadows of society into the sunlight
of American life.&quot;[16] He singled out NPR's <I>Morning Edition</I>,
<I>The MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour</I> and the <I>Charlie Rose Show</I>,
which &quot;regularly include discussions with gay and lesbian
Americans on issues of public importance,&quot; and praised CPB
for its support of gay-themed programming, such as <I>In the Life</I>,
<I>The American Playhouse</I>, <I>Longtime Companion</I>, <I>Andre's
Mother</I>, <I>The AIDS Quarterly</I>, <I>The Lost Language of
Cranes</I>, <I>Silverlake Life: The View from Here</I> and Armistead
Maupin's <I>Tales of the City</I> for bringing &quot;gay and lesbian
concerns into the mainstream of American life, where they belong.&quot;[17]
<P>
What King failed to add is that these aforementioned programs
are loaded with homosexual activists' propaganda and ignore the
health consequences of homosexual behavior.  They also ignore
the existence of the burgeoning ex-gay movement, reserving that
topic for the smear show, <I>One Nation Under God</I>.  PBS' pro-homosexual
programs also typically screen out any knowledgeable opponents
of the gay rights movement. 
<P>
In closing, King urged CPB to &quot;continue to provide leadership
in using the airwaves...to break the bonds of bigotry.&quot;[18]
<P>
Speaking of bigotry, public broadcasting harbors the last respectable
form of bigotry in America: Christian bashing.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>ANTI-RELIGIOUS PROGRAMMING</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<LI>On September 6, 1993, National Public Radio's <I>All Things
Considered</I> chronicled a controversy in Colorado Springs. 
The story was about some parents who objected to their children
being baptized without their parents' knowledge during a local
church carnival.[19] The controversy was real, and the conflict compelling.
 However NPR's handling of the story was anything but evenhanded.
<P>
Opening remarks by the reporter implied that children are no longer
safe in Colorado Springs because of the presence of Christian
groups.  No spokesmen are included to combat the anonymous charge
that Colorado Springs is fraught with &quot;religious extremism.&quot;
 The story presented an organization named The Citizen's Project
as a &quot;liberal volunteer&quot; organization that promotes
communication and understanding between its members and conservative
Christians.  However, on another program aired on NPR, which was
also openly biased against Christians, the Citizen's Project is
described as a &quot;watchdog&quot; organization that gives citizens
a sense of belonging by &quot;organizing opposition to [the Christian]
agenda.&quot;
<P>
<LI>In October of 1993, NPR broadcast a documentary titled <I>The
Politics of Bigotry</I>.  Described as an &quot;in-depth investigation
of the Christian Right...,&quot; the show was actually an ugly
smear of Christians which violated the First Amendment protection
against infringement on the free exercise of religion.  
<P>
The two-and-a-half hour documentary contains many opinions presented
as if they were fact and gives Christians no opportunity to respond
to the majority of statements made by their detractors.
<P>
<LI>A segment of PBS's <I>Bill Moyers' Journal</I> titled <I>The
New Holy War</I>[20] was supposed to be a documentary about Colorado's
&quot;Amendment Two,&quot; a statewide ballot initiative which
would have prohibited political jurisdictions across the state
from granting special rights to homosexuals.  Instead it was an
anti-religious hit piece disguised as balanced journalism.  The
issue is framed in terms of a struggle between homosexuals, who
Moyers portrays as oppressed victims fighting for their rights,
and Evangelical Christians, who are pictured as intolerant bigots.
<P>
Moyers works hard to pass himself off as an objective journalist.
 However, he reveals his bias when he conducts an in-depth critical
look at an organization supporting Amendment Two without so much
as mentioning any one of the several organizations fighting against
it.  Also, Moyers fails to inform viewers of vote totals, the
percentage of evangelical Christians in the state, or that many
non-evangelicals supported Amendment Two.  Moyers charges, but
fails to present any evidence, that the conflict was strictly
between homosexuals and Christians.[21]
<P>
Moyers' greatest omission was his failure to present an accurate
portrayal of the homosexual lifestyle.  The show features male
and female homosexual couples who are clean cut, monogamous and
well-spoken.  While this image may be true of the couples featured
on the show, it is in sharp contrast with what the research tells
us about the homosexual lifestyle.  Research shows that male homosexuals
typically are quite promiscuous, with many sexual partners over
the course of a lifetime.  In addition, homosexuals are at high
risk for a host of sexually transmitted diseases and violence
within relationships.  Homosexual males typically and tragically
have shorter lifespans.[22]  Homosexuals are also more likely to have
drug and alcohol abuse problems.[23]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>RADICAL POLITICAL PROGRAMMING</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Ultra-left <I>Pacifica</I> radio, along with PBS's <I>Frontline</I>,
<I>Point of View</I> and dozens of PBS specials, have been criticized
for left-wing bias.  Some recent examples:
<P>
<UL><LI> In 1992, KPFK, the <I>Pacifica</I> station in Los Angeles, broadcast
an <I>African Mental Liberation Weekend</I>.  The 26-hour marathon
of speeches and interviews was called a &quot;hatefeast&quot;
by members of the L.A. Jewish community.[24] Speakers included Louis
Farrakhan, who said that whites and Jews were &quot;the pale horse
with death its rider and hell close behind.&quot;[25] The broadcast
also featured black supremacist Leonard Jeffries lecturing on
Jewish involvement in the slave trade and Steve Cokely, who evoked
a &quot;Jew doctors conspiracy to infect black children with AIDS.&quot;[26]
<P>
<LI>In May 1994, NPR announced plans to run prison-life commentaries
by convicted cop-killer and former Black Panther Mumia Abu-Jamal,
claiming that the show would bring a &quot;unique perspective
to listeners.&quot;[27] Although the show was canceled after Sen.
Robert Dole took to the Senate floor to decry CPB's lack of balance,
the incident raised serious questions about CPB's judgment and
commitment to balanced programming. 
<P>
<LI>Several specials have been broadcast which support totalitarian
and anti-American causes.  For example: <I>Maria's Story</I>,
a show about the war in El Salvador from the communist FMLN's
perspective and <I>Cuba in the Shadow of Doubt</I>, which was
described by a <I>New York Times</I> critic as having &quot;...a
romantic infatuation with Cuba.&quot;[28] Another example is a PBS
documentary on families divided over the Castro regime entitled
<I>Miami-Havana</I>.  The credits of the film contain a &quot;special
thanks&quot; to the Combinado del Este prison.  According to Alberto
Mora, a Cuban-American lawyer, &quot;no prison has a grislier
reputation than Combinado del Este.  Mind you, this notoriety
stands out even in the context of a prison system infamous for
its barbarism.&quot;[29]
<P></UL>
<CENTER><H3>NO NEED FOR SUBSIDIES</H3></CENTER>
<P>
In a truly free broadcasting market, programs of very limited
appeal would most likely not garner advertising support.  They
would be confined to media that are supported by those who seek
this information.  Left-leaning foundations and individual donors
might be persuaded to fund them, but they have little incentive
to do so while it is so easy to tap the taxpayers.
<P>
The programs mentioned above are not the examples that CPB supporters
cite when they complain that good programming would be lost without
CPB.  Instead, CPB advocates point to popular shows such as <I>Sesame
Street</I> and <I>The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour</I>.  They fail
to mention that the popular shows will fare well in free market
competition.  Children's Television Workshop, parent company of
<I>Sesame Street</I>, has a stock and bond portfolio worth more
than $51 million.[30] And gross merchandising sales of Sesame Street
items rack up $1 billion annually, earning CTW about $100 million
in royalties.[31] One divisional CTW president had an annual salary,
including bonuses, of $625,000.[32] 
<P>
CPB funding makes up only 14 percent of public broadcasting's
total budget.[33] Federal grants from other agencies, such as the
National Endowment for the Arts, make up another 5 percent.  The
rest comes from donors, businesses, foundations, state governments,
public colleges and universities, auction participants and private
colleges and universities.  All told, 49 percent of public broadcasting's
budget comes from taxpayers at all levels, but the direct federal
component makes up only 19 percent.[34]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CONCLUSION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Pulling CPB's tax-funded plug would force producers to take into
account the tastes of their audiences and would motivate public
broadcasters to look to their lucrative offspring, like Barney
or Bill Moyers, to contribute more to the collective coffers.
 The result? Good programming would continue to thrive, and the
offensive and meritless programs would likely go the way of that
other big bird, the dodo.  
<P>
It's time to zero-budget the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.
 Big Bird should leave the nest of Big Government and fly on his
own.

<H2>SUFFER THE CHILDREN:<BR>
TITLE X's FAMILY PLANNING FAILURE</H2>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
<I>by </I>
<P>
<I>Gracie S. Hsu</I></CENTER>
<P>
Title X of the Public Health Service Act is a categorical grant
issued by the federal government to fund family planning projects
throughout the United States.  Enacted in 1970, Title X was supposed
to help reduce the unplanned pregnancy rate, especially in the
teenager population.  However, Title X has not only failed to
reduce the teenage pregnancy rate, but teenage reproductive health
has drastically worsened in every category.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>TITLE X'S IMPACT ON TEENAGE HEALTH</H3></CENTER> 
<P>
Over the lifetime of Title X, the number of teenage clients has
grown due to increases in both Title X funding and the overall
number of enrollees in Title X clinics.  Currently, an estimated
1.5 million Title X clients are teenagers, constituting approximately
one-third of the program's total clientele.  But even though more
teenagers are being exposed to these family planning &quot;services,&quot;
the rates of out-of-wedlock births, abortions, sexually-transmitted
diseases, and pregnancies have all risen significantly in the
teenage population since the program's inception.
<P><UL>
<LI><B>Out-of-wedlock births -- <I>Since the introduction
of Title X, the teenage out-of-wedlock birth rate has doubled.</B></I>
 The out-of-wedlock birth rate per 1,000 unmarried girls aged
15-19 rose from 22.4 in 1970 to 44.6 in 1992 (teen births have
declined since 1992).
<P>
This illegitimacy figure is especially important to note because
Title X advocates have sought to claim &quot;success&quot; by
pointing out that the overall teenage birth rate has declined.
 However, such a decline is only attributable to the decline in
<I>marital</I> births, <I>not</I> in illegitimate births.  In
1970, seventy percent of teenage births were marital; in 1991,
7 in 10 teenage births occurred <I>outside</I> marriage.
<P>
The same trend toward out-of-wedlock childbearing is evidenced
in the female population at large.  In 1970 when Title X began,
children living with one parent were more than four times as likely
to be products of divorce as they were to have been born out-of-wedlock.
 But by 1993, the Census Bureau reports found that American children
who live with one parent were almost equally divided between children
of divorce and those born to unmarried parents.
<P>
<LI><B>Abortions -- <I>Over the lifetime of Title X, the
teenage abortion rate has more than doubled.</B></I>  In 1972,
the abortion rate per 1,000 girls aged 15-19 was 19.1; in 1990,
the rate was 40.6.  While the abortion rate grew rapidly from
1972 to the early 1980s, the rate has apparently reached a plateau,
hovering between 40 and 43 abortions per 1,000 teenage girls over
the last 10 years.
<P>
While the rapid growth of the teenage abortion rate during the
early years of Title X is no doubt attributable, in large measure,
to the <I>Roe v. Wade</I> decision, the past decade's more stabilized
abortion rate cannot be viewed optimistically.  For during this
time, a rapid rise also occurred in out-of-wedlock births.
<P>
Interestingly, the women whom Title X clinics target -- low-income
women, minorities, and unmarried young people -- have the highest
abortion rates.  And, the Alan Guttmacher Institute reports that
half of all women having an abortion used a contraceptive method
in the month during which they conceived.
<P>
<LI><B>Sexually-Transmitted Diseases (STDs) -- <I>Sexually-transmitted
diseases among teenagers have increased dramatically despite the
fact that many Title X clinics provide both contraception and
STD screening.  In fact, teenagers now have higher rates of gonorrhea
than any other 5-year age group between 20 and 44.</B></I>  Currently,
one in four sexually experienced teenagers -- about 3 million
-- become infected with an STD every year.
<P>
For the first time ever, teenage girls have the highest gonorrhea
rates in the nation; teenage boys rank second.  The rate in adolescent
girls is 20 times higher than in women over 30, according to the
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  Infectious
syphilis rates more than doubled among teenagers since the mid-1980s.
 Additionally, up to 15 percent of sexually experienced teenage
girls are infected with human papilloma virus, many of them carrying
a strain that can cause cervical cancer.  Chlamydia also has spread
explosively, currently infecting 22 percent of sexually active
girls and 10 percent of sexually active boys.  Finally, one in
five reported full-blown AIDS cases is diagnosed among people
in their 20s.  Due to the virus' long incubation period (about
10 years), most were adolescents when they were infected, according
to the CDC.
<P>
Sexually-transmitted diseases can lead to cancer, pelvic inflammatory
disease, ectopic pregnancy, infertility, and/or even death.  Estimates
from the general population indicate that between 100,000 and
150,000 women become infertile each year as a result of an STD,
and about 15 to 30 percent of the 2.3 million U.S. couples who
are infertile may be unable to conceive as a result of an STD.
 But beyond infertility, STDs also increase the likelihood of
contracting HIV.  According to some estimates, having an STD,
such as gonorrhea, increases by as much as 100 times the chance
of contracting HIV from an infected partner.
<P>
<LI><B>Pregnancies -- <I>Since the introduction of Title
X, the out-of-wedlock pregnancy rate among 15-to 19-year-old girls
has doubled.</B></I>  In the same time span, the <I>overall</I>
teenage pregnancy rate (marital and nonmarital) increased 23 percent,
climbing from 95.1 per 1,000 girls aged 15-19 in 1972 to 117.1
in 1990.  So not only did the overall teenage pregnancy rate increase,
but a greater proportion of these pregnancies are now out-of-wedlock.
 This trend is best evidenced by the growing rate of out-of-wedlock
births.  When Title X began, only 3 in 10 teen births were out-of-wedlock;
now 7 in 10 teen births occur outside marriage.
<P>
Despite the 23 percent increase in the overall teen pregnancy
rate, Title X advocates still claim &quot;success&quot; by stating
that &quot;fewer sexually experienced teenagers become pregnant
each year.&quot;  Advocates often remark that the pregnancy rate
among sexually experienced teenagers has decreased from 254 to
207 per 1,000 (19%) in the last two decades.  However, this figure
is derived from a statistical invention called the &quot;sexually
experienced teenage pregnancy rate&quot; (SETPR) which obscures
the disastrous changes in teenage sexual activity and ignores
the real indices of social health, i.e., the rates of teenage
pregnancy, abortion, out-of-wedlock births, and STDs.  The fact
is, a greater proportion of teenagers are sexually experienced
today than 20 years ago.
<P>
Consider the following hypothetical comparison of two nations,
Country A and Country B:
<p><pre><center>
<B>Country    # of teenage     # sexually     # pregnant    SETPR
          girls 15-19      active         annually           </B>
<P>
  A        1,000,000        500,000       200,000       400
  B        1,000,000        100,000       50,000        500
</center></pre><p>
In this straightforward example, Country B has a 25% higher &quot;sexually
experienced teenage pregnancy rate&quot; than Country A.  But
Country B has only one-fifth the sexual activity rate of Country
A and one-fourth of its teenage pregnancy rate.  In fact, it is
obvious that Country A can have a lower SETPR than Country B while
still having a higher sexual activity rate, a higher rate of STDs,
a higher number of pregnancies, and both four times as many abortions
and out-of-wedlock births as Country B!  SETPR may be of some
statistical interest at the margin, but as a measure of adolescent
well-being it is not merely useless, but grossly misleading.
</UL><P>
<CENTER><H3>TITLE X FUNDING</H3></CENTER>
<P>
By all accounts, teenage reproductive health has suffered under
Title X's watch.  Yet, incredibly, Title X programs continue to
receive <I>increased</I> government funding, currently reaching
an all-time high of $193 million for fiscal year 1995.  Why? 
Because there is <I>no</I> <I>accountability</I> or measure of
effectiveness connected to the funding of the program.  There
has never been an evaluation component included in the grants;
and in 1983, the Department of Health and Human Services discontinued
collecting client data.
<P>
The federal government is not only funding a failed program, it
is funding an <I>unauthorized</I> program.  Title X's funding
authorization officially expired in 1985, but the program continues
to receive federal dollars every year through inclusion in the
Labor/Health and Human Services Appropriations bill.
<P>
<B>PROHIBITION OF ABORTION</B> -- Section 1008 of Title X states
that &quot;none of the funds appropriated under this title shall
be used in programs where abortion is a method of family planning.&quot;
 Yet many of the clinics which receive Title X funds perform abortions
in addition to providing other family planning services.  These
clinics creatively &quot;obey&quot; the prohibition by maintaining
separate budgets for abortion and family planning.  However, when
self-titled &quot;family planning&quot; clinics perform abortions
and refer clients for abortion when contraception fails, an implicit
assumption exists that abortion is indeed a method of family planning.
 Additionally, many Planned Parenthood (PP) clinics receive Title
X funds.  And while not all of these PP clinics perform abortions,
Planned Parenthood's reputation as an abortion provider is undisputable.
 Thus, to the client, no relevant distinction is made between
abortion and family planning; in fact, the prohibition has been
reduced to a mere bookkeeping formality.  Such a misuse of the
statute must be immediately halted and the integrity of the prohibition's
original intent restored.
<P>
<CENTER> <H3>TEENAGE SEXUAL ACTIVITY AND CONTRACEPTIVE USE</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Poor teenage reproductive health outcomes and Title X funding
are clearly correlated.  But the question that begs to be answered
is, &quot;What accounts for the correlation?  What effect do contraceptive
counseling and dispensing have on teenagers' sexual behavior?&quot;
 While such questions cannot be answered easily, there are clues
which point in a common direction.
<UL><P>
<LI>Sexual activity rates among teenagers are higher now than ever
before.  Currently, fifty-six percent of girls and 73 percent
of boys have intercourse before age 18, compared to 35 percent
and 55 percent in the early 1970s.
<P>
<LI>A 1993 <I>Public Health Reports</I> article found that adolescent
males who had been instructed in sexual biology and birth control
were at a higher risk of early first intercourse than were those
who had received no instruction.
<P>
<LI>Research from Planned Parenthood shows that the number one reason,
by far, that teenagers initiate sexual activity is peer pressure.
 By promoting contraceptive use among teenagers, Title X clinics
reduce the number of outside forces bolstering teenagers' resolve
to save sex for marriage.
</UL><P>
<B>MULTIPLE PARTNERS</B> -- According to the Centers for Disease
Control, &quot;The initiation of sexual intercourse early in life
is associated with an increased number of sex partners and a greater
risk for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).&quot;  Data show
that one-half of sexually experienced teenage girls wait almost
18 months between first intercourse and having sex with a second
sexual partner; another one-fourth wait almost 2 years.  Thus,
helping teenagers to delay sex initiation is especially important.
<P>
However, evidence also indicates that <I>contraceptive use leads
to increased sexual activity, with a greater number of partners.</I>
 Consequently, the dispensing of prescription contraceptives without
parental involvement by family planning clinics would serve to
exacerbate this trend -- which is, in fact, what is happening
today.
<UL><P>
<LI>Among sexually active girls aged 15-17, 55 percent have had
2 or more partners and 13 percent have had at least 6.
<P>
<LI>Between 1971 and 1988, the percentage of sexually experienced
women aged 15-19 living in urban areas who reported 4 or more
sex partners increased from 14% to 31%.
<P>
<LI>Forty-five percent of 15-24-year-olds who had initiated sexual
intercourse before age 18 reported having had four or more partners;
75 percent reported having had two or more partners.
<P>
<LI>Dr. Robert Kistner of Harvard Medical School, one of the developers
of the oral contraceptive, subsequently acknowledged that use
of contraceptives among teenagers is stimulating higher levels
of promiscuity:  &quot;About ten years ago I declared that the
pill would not lead to promiscuity.  Well, I was wrong,&quot;
he said (<I>Family Practice News</I>, 1977).
</UL><P>
<B>CONTRACEPTIVE FAILURE</B> -- Not only does contraceptive use
lead to increased sexual activity with a greater number of partners,
but contraception is not terribly effective at protecting teenagers
from unplanned pregnancy and/or STD infection.  Indeed, one-third
of teenage pregnancies occur <I>while a contraceptive is being
used</I>, and this figure does not even take into account the
STD transmission rate.
<P>
In part, this is due to the fact that no contraceptive method
is highly effective in protecting simultaneously against pregnancy
and infection.  Contraceptives with the best record for reducing
pregnancy risk offer little, if any, protection against STDs.
 On the other hand, condoms have a standardized failure rate of
15.7 percent at preventing <I>pregnancy</I> over the course of
a year; in teenagers, the rate is even higher.  In addition to
a poor contraceptive record, condoms have not been shown to be
effective at protecting women against STD infection.  A recent
<I>Family Planning Perspectives</I> article found that condoms
may protect women against some STDs, but the data are equivocal.
 In several studies, condoms showed no protective effect against
cervical human papilloma virus, chlamydia, or bacterial vaginosis
in women.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>MATERNAL AND INFANT MORTALITY</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Maternal and infant mortality might not seem, at first glance,
to be related to a discussion of Title X's impact on teenagers;
but, in reality, the two concepts are inextricably connected.
 Title X's mandate is to reduce maternal and infant mortality
and to promote the health of mothers and children.  However, Title
X has miserably failed in fulfilling this mandate.  America ranks
24th in the world in infant survival, a very low ranking for a
developed country, let alone the wealthiest country in the world.
 And the problems associated with Title X -- out-of-wedlock births,
teenage pregnancies, and STDs -- are major factors undermining
maternal and infant health.
<UL><P>
<LI><B>Out-of-wedlock births</B> -- Nicholas Eberstadt and others
have shown that marital status at birth is the key indicator for
infant mortality, transcending both ethnicity and poverty.  And
the out-of-wedlock teenage birth rate has soared under Title X's
watch.
<P>
<LI><B>Teenage pregnancy</B> -- One major cause of infant mortality
is low birth weight, which is directly related to teenage pregnancy.
 Thus it comes as no surprise that Title X's failure to reduce
teenage pregnancy would also result in higher infant mortality.
<P>
<LI><B>Sexually-transmitted diseases</B> -- As was discussed earlier,
STDs have a negative impact on women's health, possibly leading
to cancer, infertility, and even death.  Ectopic pregnancies,
which can be caused by STDs, have quadrupled since 1970, and the
rate of infertility among women has also dramatically increased.
 But in addition to women, STDs hurt infants.  The infection of
infants from the mother's STDs (including, but not limited to
HIV) has become a significant problem and will only continue to
worsen as nonmarital sexual activity remains unchecked.
</UL><P>
<CENTER><H3>FRC RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING TITLE X</CENTER></H3>
<P>
<B>(1)</B>  <B>Remove all funding from Title X</B> -- Title X
has not only failed to reduce the rates of teenage pregnancy,
out-of-wedlock births, and sexually-transmitted diseases, it has
exacerbated these problems.  The program's lack of evaluation
criteria and its approach as an open-ended project grant have
frustrated accountability.
<P>
Title X does not deserve to continue receiving taxpayer dollars
and, in fact, <I>should</I> not be receiving federal dollars,
as an unauthorized program.  The federal government has a responsibility
to use federal funds wisely, and it should not be funding programs
which, by all accounts, have produced worsened health outcomes.
<P>
<B>(2)</B>  <B>If Title X comes up for reauthorization, do not
reauthorize</B> -- Title X's authorization expired in 1985.  And
Title X should remain unauthorized because it has never been shown
to benefit the American public.
<P>
<B>(3)</B>  <B>Promote saving sex for the context of marriage</B>
-- If the federal government must play a role in &quot;family
planning,&quot; it ought to promote the optimum health message
-- that sex should be saved for marriage.  Research shows that
people who postpone sexual activity until marriage and practice
monogamy within marriage are more likely to be sexually satisfied,
to have enduring marriages, and to be free from the ravages of
out-of-wedlock pregnancies and sexually-transmitted diseases.

<P>
Adoption is a good choice and sound policy.  And now it is finally
receiving some well-deserved attention by Congress.  Under consideration
are two laudable reform proposals which would make it easier for
more people to choose adoption.
<P>
(1) <B>Reducing financial obstacles</B> -- The House GOP's Contract
with America includes the Family Reinforcement Act, of which adoption
assistance is a primary component.  This proposal would make adoption
a more affordable choice for prospective adoptive parents by allowing
a tax credit of up to $5,000 for qualified adoption expenses.
 These expenses could include adoption fees, court costs, attorney
fees, and other expenses which are directly related to the legal
adoption of the child.  Appropriately, the legislation explicitly
excludes payments to surrogate mothers and to individuals adopting
their spouse's children.
<P>
(2) <B>Reducing legal (and psychological) barriers -- </B>As
a proposed amendment to the welfare reform bill, the National
Council for Adoption has suggested that unmarried mothers who
place their babies for adoption should be exempted from provisions
which require welfare recipients to identify the father of the
child as a condition of receiving assistance.  The proposal recognizes
paternal rights by giving fathers a period of up to thirty days
after the child's birth to come forward and claim custody of the
child.  Should the father fail to do so, his rights would be terminated,
and the child would be eligible for adoption.  This proposal should
be reviewed as a possible alternative to single parenthood that
increases the incentive for unwed mothers to choose adoption.
<P>
These proposals are laudable because they encourage adoption --
a beneficial option for the birthmother, the adopted child, and
the adoptive parents.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>BENEFITS OF ADOPTION FOR THE CHILD</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Adoption holds many benefits for the child involved.  Recently,
the Search Institute conducted the largest U.S. study of adopted
adolescents and their families to evaluate the mental health of
these adolescents at a time when they are forming their identities.
 This study, combined with other research, found that adopted
adolescents reap the following benefits:
<P>
<UL><LI><B>A Loving, Intact Family</B> -- Ninety percent of adopted
children live with married parents, and these families exhibit
high levels of warmth, communication, discipline, and cohesion.
 Indeed, the Search Institute's representative sample found that
only 11 percent of adopted adolescents report divorce or separation
compared to 28 percent in a national survey of adolescents.
<P>
<LI><B>Deep Child-Parent Attachment</B> -- Adopted adolescents
are as deeply attached to their parents as are their non-adopted
siblings.  Fifty-four percent report strong attachment to both
parents; another 30 percent are deeply attached to one parent.
 Equally compelling is the fact that 95 percent of parents experience
strong attachment to their adopted child.
<P>
<LI><B>Strong Self-Identity</B> -- Most adopted adolescents have
a strong self-identity, exhibiting higher levels of self-esteem
than their peers.  They accept their adoptive status with relative
ease and are as likely to report a positive self-identity as their
non-adopted siblings.
<P>
<LI><B>Positive Psychological Health</B> -- Based on multiple
indices of psychological health, the study found that at least
three-quarters of adopted adolescents are within the zone of positive
psychological health, even surpassing a comparison sample of public
school adolescents on several measures.
<P>
<LI><B>Financial Provision</B> -- Fifty-four percent of adopted
children live in homes with family income three times higher than
poverty level.
</UL><P>
<CENTER><H3>BENEFITS OF ADOPTION FOR THE SINGLE MOTHER</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Research shows that young, unmarried women who choose adoption
for their babies reap many personal benefits.  Comparing favorably
to their counterparts, who choose single parenthood, women who
choose adoption exhibit the following characteristics.  They are:
<P>
<UL><LI>More likely to complete high school and advance further educationally.
<LI>More likely to be employed and have a higher income.
<LI>Less likely to live in poverty.
<LI>Less likely to receive public assistance than birth mothers
who chose to parent out-of-wedlock.  In fact, 60 percent of welfare
recipients are, or were at one time, teenage mothers.
<LI>More likely to marry subsequently.
<LI><B>Less likely to have a repeat out-of-wedlock pregnancy</B>
than the teenagers who choose parenting or abortion.
</UL><P>
<CENTER><H3>THE NEED FOR ADOPTION POLICY</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Adoption provides children with the benefits of solid, two-parent
homes while giving birthmothers the opportunity to mature before
taking on the adult responsibilities of childrearing.  That policy
should encourage adoption as a positive alternative for women
facing crisis pregnancies seems especially prudent during this
time when our nation's rates of out-of-wedlock pregnancy, abortion,
and single parenthood are skyrocketing.
<P>
<UL><LI><B>Illegitimacy</B> -- Births to unmarried teenagers continue
to escalate dramatically.  In 1992, there were 365,000 out-of-wedlock
teenage births -- a six-fold increase since 1950.  But even in
the population at large (not limited to teenagers), illegitimacy
is rampant.  Thirty percent of all our nation's children were
born to unwed mothers in 1991; in the black community, the figure
was an astounding 68 percent.
<P>
<LI><B>Single Parenthood</B> -- The number of children being raised
in single-parent homes is rapidly rising.  In 1970, 7.5 million
children lived in single, female-headed homes; by 1993, the figure
had more than doubled to 15.6 million.  In fact, over 27 percent
of all children under 18 live in single-parent homes (1993).
<P>
<LI><B>Abortion</B> -- Abortion is strongly linked to unwed pregnancy.
 Indeed, unmarried mothers account for 70 to 80 percent of the
1.5 million abortions performed on U.S. women; 406,000 abortions
were obtained by teenagers in 1992.  Thus, helping to make adoption
a more viable option could mean (1) fewer abortions, including
repeat abortions, and (2) many women being spared from experiencing
the trauma of post-abortion syndrome.
<P>
<LI><B>Poverty</B> -- Regardless of race or socioeconomic background,
a high correlation exists between single parenthood and poverty.
 Of all children under age 6 living in poverty, 61 percent are
from single-parent families (1992).  In fact, children under age
6 from single-parent households are more likely to live in poverty
than not.
<P>
<LI><B>Breaking the cycle</B> -- For the child of a single parent,
the statistical odds of becoming an unwed mother later in life,
or fathering a child out-of-wedlock, are staggering.  One study
found that 80 percent of the girls who were mothers at 15 were
themselves daughters of teenage mothers.  Adoption can help break
that cycle.
</UL><P>
The American public overwhelmingly supports adoption policy. 
A recent Family Research Council survey of 1,000 Americans found
that, by a margin of 3-to-1, respondents favor efforts &quot;to
make it easier for children born out-of-wedlock to be adopted.&quot;
 And when presented with four options to resolve out-of-wedlock
teenage pregnancies, 33 percent of respondents thought it best
to &quot;have the child and put it up for adoption;&quot; 25 percent
thought it best for the mother &quot;to marry the child's father
and have the child;&quot; 13 percent thought it best for the mother
&quot;to have the child and raise it by herself;&quot; and only
10 percent thought it best for her to have an abortion.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>THE CURRENT STATUS OF ADOPTION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Even though most people agree that adoption is a good choice,
few exercise that option.  Only 6 percent of all teenage mothers
choose adoption for their babies; in the black community, adoption
accounts for less than one percent.  So while the number of potentially
adoptable children is theoretically large due to the high numbers
of out-of-wedlock births and crisis pregnancies, there remains,
ironically, a shortage of children.  An estimated one to two million
prospective parents are <I>still waiting to adopt a child</I>.
<P>
Perhaps one of the reasons why so few unwed mothers choose adoption
for their babies is that adoption frequently is not presented
to women as a viable choice.  One study found that nearly 40 percent
of pregnancy counselors fail to include adoption as an option
in their counseling.  Even worse, the counselors had a 40 percent
rate of uncertainty and inaccurate knowledge about adoption. 
Incredibly, some pregnancy counselors who thought adoption would
be a good choice still failed to present it as an option, because
they thought the girls would not want to hear about it.
<P>
Consequently, the number of adoptions reflects the lack of attention
adoption has received.  The latest available data show that 51,157
unrelated adoptions (adoptions by people not related to the child
by blood or marriage) of American children occurred in 1986. 
Of these 51,000-plus domestic adoptions, approximately one-half
were adoptions of healthy infants (under 2 years of age) of all
races and ethnic backgrounds.  The remaining adoptions were of
older kids or of children with special needs, i.e., physical,
mental, or emotional disabilities, part of a sibling group, etc.
<P>
In addition to the adoption of American children, there were 10,097
foreign-born children adopted by Americans in 1987.  However,
due to a decrease in the number of adoptions of South Korean children,
this figure has since declined to an estimated 6,500 adoptions
in fiscal year 1992.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>FURTHER POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Because of adoption's many benefits for both mother and child,
enabling more women to choose adoption should be a policy priority.
 Thus, in addition to the two proposals discussed earlier, the
Family Research Council recommends the following measures to make
the promotion of adoption more comprehensive.
<P>
(1)  Protocol for counseling women in crisis pregnancies should
include presentation of the adoption choice and its manifold benefits.
 This protocol should be used by counselors regardless of their
place of employment, i.e., crisis pregnancy centers, public health
facilities, and abortion clinics.  Inherent in this recommendation
is the expectation that such counselors would be properly trained
and adequately informed about the adoption option.  Furthermore,
the development of maternity homes should also be encouraged as
a way to promote adoption, as such homes have higher rates of
relinquishment than do other facilities.
<P>
(2)  The Department of Health and Human Services should collect
data on all adoptions, both public and private.  Currently, the
federal government only tracks adoption through the public system,
and the data available on the private sector is both limited and
outdated.  Data collection would also be enhanced through the
use of uniform data collection measures in each of the states.
 In addition to tracking the number of adoptions, the federal
government should encourage social science research regarding
adoption's impact on adopted children, birthmothers, and adoptive
parents.  This would not only add to the slim body of knowledge
already existing, it would also heighten awareness of the adoption
choice.
<P>
(3)  Reduce the barriers for prospective parents to choose adoption.
 This would include removing the obstacles hindering transracial
adoptions, reforming the insurance code to guarantee coverage
for adopted special-needs children, and speeding up the process
by which foster children could be adopted.

<P>
The American Psychiatric Association is a leading private, clinical
professional organization.  Over the years, the APA increasingly
has promoted greater acceptance of homosexuality.  And now, some
APA members are trying to outlaw counseling to homosexuals who
desire to change their orientation.
<P>
The association's pro-homosexual position is not shared by some
of its own members, and it offends many people of faith.  For
example, APA member Dr. Roy H. Hart writes from a Jewish perspective
in <I>Psychiatric News</I> that organized psychiatry does not
choose to understand religion's aversion to homosexuality.  He
writes in the May 1994 edition, &quot;Americans have the highest
rate of church attendance and membership in the Christian world,
but psychiatrists contribute little to those statistics.  What
is ego-alien for the psychiatrist -- religion -- is the center
of existence for a vast segment of the population.&quot;[1]
<P>
APA President John McIntyre tried to bridge the chasm with religion
when, after a pilgrimage to the epicenter of Mormonism, Salt Lake
City, he commented on the &quot;improved dialogue between religion
and psychiatry.&quot;[2]
<P>
The bridge McIntyre began to build in 1994 is now crumbling with
the advent of the January 1995 issue of the <I>American Journal
of Psychiatry</I>, the APA's official publication.  That issue
contains an article by Franklin D. Jones and Ronald J. Koshes,
&quot;Homosexuality and the Military&quot; which adds salt to
an old wound.[3] The article is noteworthy for its poor review of
research.  Its quick initial turn-around along with its array
of revisions suggests that the <I>AJP</I> editorial staff ignored
normal review procedures in order to publish a politicized article.

<CENTER><H3>"HOMOSEXUALITY AND THE MILITARY"</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B>1. Underwent an unusual review process.</B>  The article
was received by the <I>AJP</I> staff on July 14, 1993.[4] It was
subsequently revised four times before it was accepted June 17,
1994.[5] The first revision was received within four months, a very
brief time for this internationally recognized journal.  Following
the initial review there were at least three more revisions, suggesting
an unusual review process -- more like a dialogue than a peer-review
process.  In typical peer review, one or at most two revisions
are allowed. 
<P>
<B>2. Misrepresents the history of the military's homosexual
policy.</B>  The authors claim that the Pentagon's policy was
first formalized in 1982, and that the ban dates back to World
War II.[6] But the policy was formalized by President Carter and
became effective on January 16, 1981.  It was revised and updated
January 28, 1982.
<P>
The military's homosexual policy dates back to the British Articles
of War in 1775.  An individual was drummed out of the Continental
Army for attempted sodomy in 1778.[7] Prior to WW II, the legal
construction of the Articles of War and Army regulations were
broader in nature than today's.  Homosexual misconduct was prosecuted
under the categories of &quot;conduct unbecoming an officer&quot;
or, for enlisted members, &quot;conduct to the prejudice of good
order and military discipline.&quot;  After 1900, individuals
were punished for committing homosexual acts, which were lumped
under the rubric of sodomy.[8]
<P>
A WW I War Department circular, signed by the Surgeon General
in 1917, listed homosexuality as cause for rejection under the
category of &quot;psychopathic&quot; characteristics.[9] The 1921
enlistment standards included an implied homosexual policy excluding
people thought to be homosexual.[10] The right to make decisions
concerning the retention of enlisted men was delegated to relatively
low levels.  Discharges for &quot;inaptness or undesirable habits
or traits of character&quot; were handled under Section 8, Army
Regulation 615-360.[11]
<P>
The War Department's 1941 policy, which was harsher than previous
ones, emphasized that homosexual &quot;sodomists&quot; would not
be discharged but court-martialed.[12] Despite this increased penalty,
during the war there was an unofficial toleration of some homosexuals
because replacements were not guaranteed.  The policy was revised
in May, 1947 and, again, in 1949 to mandate that &quot;[h]omosexual
personnel, irrespective of sex, should not be permitted to serve
in any branch of the Armed Forces in any capacity, and prompt
separation of known homosexuals from the Armed Forces is mandatory.&quot;[13]
<P>
This fundamental was added to the Uniform Code of Military Justice
in 1951 with Articles 125 (act of sodomy) and 134 (assault). 
In September, 1958, Class III homosexuals (those who had committed
no homosexual act while in the military service) were furnished
honorable or general discharges based on the character of their
service.[14]
<P>
In the late 1970s, the Report of the Joint Service Administrative
Discharge Study Group recommended that the military reaffirm the
longstanding ban (indeed, it was more than 200 years old) on homosexuals
by incorporating into the policy the principled phrase, &quot;homosexuality
is incompatible with military service.&quot;  It also called for
the phrase, &quot;processing (for separation) is mandatory unless...the
allegations are groundless,&quot; to be included in all subsequent
Department of Defense (DoD) directives.  It also recommended some
leniency in cases of &quot;unsuitability,&quot; i.e., those involved
in homosexual tendencies or acts between consenting adults would
be honorably discharged.[15]
<P>
The 1982 policy cited in the <I>AJP</I> article incorporates the
aforementioned recommendations but was first published during
the last days of President Carter's administration.  That policy
was replaced by a law signed by President Clinton on November
30, 1993.  The Pentagon published implementing regulations on
February 28, 1994.
<P>
<B>3. Misrepresents the homosexual discharge history</B>.
 The authors cite homosexual discharge numbers and costs from
a discredited 1992 General Accounting Office study.[16] Other studies
show that the GAO underestimated the scope of homosexual discharges
and overestimated the costs to the government.
<P>
The GAO report stated that it costs the government $27 million
annually to discharge homosexuals.  But that figure is misleading.
 The military has a fixed number of authorized personnel, established
by Congress.  The projected annual number of enlistments is directly
related to the projected number of losses to achieve the established
end strength.  The cost to train new service members and to separate
other members is determined from the projected number of enlistments
and losses.  Those are sunk costs tied to running the training
base and a change of a few percent is of no real financial consequence.
<P>
Given the size of the military, the number of homosexuals discharged
is small.  For example, from 1980 through 1991, a total of 8,427,872
people served in the military.  During that same period there
were 17,840 non-judicial administrative discharges for homosexuality
--  .0021 percent of all of those who served during that period.
 An unpublished Army study during the same period puts homosexual
discharges in perspective.  It found there were 3,153 administrative
discharges for homosexuality between 1983 and 1991 but five times
(13,655) more for alcohol abuse and four times (10,845) more for
personnel being overweight.
<P>
The article also fails to mention homosexual punitive separations
which were not included in the GAO report.  A study obtained from
the Pentagon under the Freedom of Information Act analyzed 100
Army cases from 1989 to 1992.  Forty-nine percent of those cases
involved children as victims.  Eighty-five percent involved victims
who had not consented, and five percent of the offenders were
HIV-positive.[17]
<P>
The same report summarized a 1992 incident at Fort Hood, Texas,
where 60 homosexual men [soldiers and civilians] met in a public
toilet next to a child care center.  The men cut holes in the
walls to permit sex between men in adjacent stalls.  The men also
installed a mirror to allow them to see the approach of intruders.
<P>
These homosexuals were indiscriminate in their choice of partners
and often engaged in sex within moments of entering the bathroom.
 Sexual acts included oral and anal sodomy, mutual masturbation,
and fondling of the buttocks.  All soldiers in this incident received
disciplinary discharges which would not have been measured by
the 1992 GAO study.  This information was neither cited by GAO
nor by the <I>AJP</I> review.
<P>
<B>4. Relies on debunked Kinsey research to distort the
estimate of homosexuals in the military.</B>  The authors state,
&quot;Most authors feel this [4 percent exclusively homosexual]
is too conservative and that about 7 percent to 10 percent are
primarily homosexual in orientation.  Kinsey et al. also found
that 37 percent of males between childhood and old age had experienced
homoerotic orgasm, and another 13 percent claimed to have had
homoerotic stimulation without overt contact.  If these epidemiological
data are reliable, the policy of the Department of Defense would
severely limit the induction and retention of service members...strict
adherence to the Kinsey data and the policy of the Department
of Defense would result in the elimination of every other soldier
(37 percent plus 13 percent) in today's military.&quot;[18]
<P>
Alfred C. Kinsey, an Indiana University zoologist, who authored
<I>Sexual Behavior in the Human Male</I> in 1948, based his research
on 12,000 interviews.  Kinsey relied heavily on data gleaned from
criminals and extrapolated his findings to the general population.
 Psychologist Abraham Maslow said that Kinsey's work, like all
sex surveys, had a high margin of &quot;volunteer&quot; error
because many people are not honest or willing to talk about their
most intimate sexual secrets.[19] 
<P>
No reputable survey has replicated Kinsey's findings, and a number
of recent studies suggest that the homosexual population is considerably
less than 10 percent of the U.S. population.  For example, a 1991
national survey of sexually active adults done by the National
Opinion Research Center shows that 98.4 percent of adults were
exclusively heterosexual that year.[20] A 1993 survey by the Battelle
Human Affairs Research Centers found that only 1.1 percent of
all Americans are exclusively homosexual.[21] A survey conducted
by the Alan Guttmacher Institute in 1993 found that one percent
of men consider themselves exclusively homosexual.[22] And a 1994
National Health and Social Life Survey at the University of Chicago
found that 2.8 percent of men and 1.4 percent of women identified
themselves as homosexual or bisexual.[23]
<P>
A March 1994 article in the <I>American Journal of Psychiatry</I>
cites several surveys of American men showing the prevalence of
homosexuality.  For example, the National Survey of Men found
that only 1.1 percent of men have been exclusively homosexual
during the preceding 10 years.  Another study found that 2.4 percent
of men are currently homosexual.[24]
<P>
<B>5. Relies on outdated polls to indicate that the public
supports lifting the ban. </B>The article cites two surveys done
before the national debate to suggest that Americans now favor
lifting the ban.[25]  It does not cite surveys with contradictory
findings nor does it discuss these contradictions.
<P>
Public support for lifting the ban eroded as the debate intensified
in 1993.  Midway through the debate, support for lifting the ban
was no more than 40 percent.[26] A national poll by Fabrizio, McLaughlin
&amp; Associates in March 1993 found that a decisive 54 percent
to 37 percent of voters disagreed that President Clinton should
overrule military leaders such as General Colin Powell and require
the military to accept homosexuals.[27]
<P>
Most military personnel support the ban.  A February 1993 <I>Los
Angeles Times</I> survey found that 40 percent of service members
disapprove, on moral grounds, of lifting the ban and 46 percent
said lifting the ban would enter into their reenlistment decisions.
 Another 11 percent said flatly that they would not reenlist because
of it.[28] A February 1993 CNN/Gallup Poll found that 74 percent
of men who had not attended college opposed lifting the ban. 
This is the prime recruiting population.
<P>
In essence, this review selectively cites survey data to support
its position, implying that no other dissimilar results have been
found.  
<P>
<B>6. Ignores the law and relies on Clinton's inconsistent
policy.</B>  The article makes no mention of the military's homosexual
law which was signed by President Clinton on November 30, 1993.
 The authors suggest that the regulations will &quot;generate
a series of court cases based on the freedom of speech and self-incrimination
statutes of the U.S. Constitution.&quot;[29]
<P>
No doubt the new regulations will be contested in the courts.
 The fact that the law and the new regulations are inconsistent,
however, is significant.  This fact was ignored by the authors.
 Consider some of the problems:
<P>
<LI>The Clinton Administration interpreted the law to permit so-called
&quot;celibate&quot; homosexuals to serve.  This view, i.e., that
&quot;celibate&quot; homosexuals even exist, contradicts past
legal rulings and will lead to more homosexuals serving and fewer
investigations of their likely misconduct.
<P>
<LI>The regulations dropped the critical statement that &quot;homosexuality
is incompatible with military service.&quot;  While Congress has
carried this principle forward in the law, Secretary of Defense
William Perry failed to include it in the regulations.[30]
<P>
<LI>The new policy potentially cripples military discipline by creating
a number of new obstacles before investigations can be started.
 Thus the regulations prevent commanders from investigating soldiers
for homosexuality without clear evidence that they have done something
criminally wrong.  According to Perry, attending gay pride parades,
frequenting gay bars, and possessing gay materials are not &quot;credible&quot;
evidence to initiate an investigation.[31]
<P>
<LI>The &quot;Perry rules&quot; also prevent criminal investigation
agencies from looking into most cases of adult, private, consensual
sexual misconduct, e.g., sodomy and adultery.[32]
<P>
<LI>Under the Perry rules, and directly contrary to more than 200
years of military practice, the DoD no longer considers homosexual
or bisexual behavior a marker for increased security risk.  Questions
about homosexuality were removed from security background investigations,
and information discovered during a security investigation cannot
be used for adverse action without high-level political permission.[33]
<P>
Clinton's Pentagon appointees are now pointing to the constant
number of homosexual discharges as proof that the policy is fine
as implemented.[34] This is misleading.  Most homosexuals facing
discharge do not challenge their separation.  However, it takes
just one advocate to exploit the weaknesses in the regulations
and then a court, deferring to the &quot;military's&quot; interpretation,
will strike down the statute as unconstitutional.   
<P>
Meanwhile, many soldiers are uncertain about Clinton's policy.
 In October 1994, military sociologist Charles Moskos conducted
an informal survey of soldiers in Haiti.  He found that 39 percent
thought the policy too lenient, 36 percent thought it to be a
good policy, and 22 percent were not sure.[35]  
<P>
<B>7. Attacks current policy requiring military psychiatrists
to report homosexual service members.</B>[36] The military does not
recognize absolute doctor-patient confidentiality.  A military
physician treating someone for a disorder that disqualifies the
member from continued service is bound by the regulation to report
the situation.  This is important for deployment and health readiness
purposes.
<P>
<B>8. Distorts facts about allied military experiences
with homosexuals.</B>  The article states, &quot;a survey of the
policies and practices of NATO armies revealed that only 24 percent
(4 of 17: New Zealand, Portugal, the United Kingdom, and the United
States) had exclusionary and separation policies.&quot;[37] The authors
ignore the June 1993 GAO report on &quot;Homosexuals in the Military:
 Policies and Practices of Foreign Countries.&quot;[38] This report
certainly could have been obtained and cited, given the number
of allowed revisions.  The GAO reviewed 25 countries and selected
four countries for detailed analysis.  The report states that
11 countries have policies that do not permit homosexuals to serve
in the military, 11 have policies that do.  Three of the latter
11 countries do not have any laws, regulations, or policies that
address this issue.  An unpublished Pentagon study conducted in
December 1992 found that some of those countries that permit homosexuals
to serve do so with strict guidelines. 
<P>
Testimony before the Senate and House Armed Services Committees
(SASC and HASC) in April and May 1993 illustrates the dramatic
differences between foreign militaries and our own.  For example,
the Netherlands started a homosexual military experiment in 1974.
 That nation has 65,000 service members, including 40,000 conscripts
who serve 14 months and who primarily commute from home each day.
 The U.S. has 2.5 million active and reserve service personnel
stationed in the U.S. and around the world at any given time.
 The German armed forces, which are included among those that
do <I>not</I> have an exclusionary policy, will not induct acknowledged
homosexual volunteers because they would &quot;undermine military
order and discipline.&quot;[39] Of the 476,300 members, 43 percent
are conscripts who, if identified as homosexual, may be required
to undergo psychological tests to determine their fitness.  The
German Federal Administrative Court declared in November 1990
that the military is justified in not allowing homosexuals to
serve in leadership and educational positions.
<P>
Foreign social experiences have little relevance for America's
military.  The U.S. is a superpower with urgent missions worldwide.
 America also has a radical homosexual community and a liberal
judicial system, a combination that guarantees a steady stream
of legal activism that is disruptive to military morale.
<P>
<B>9. Falsely claims that most societies approve of homosexuality.</B>
 The article states, &quot;Cultural studies....  In the early
1950s Ford and Beach studied 77 modern primitive societies concerning
attitudes toward homosexuality.  They found 28 condemned in which
it was condemned but 49, nearly two-thirds, in which it was approved
in more or less restricted forms.&quot;[40]
<P>
This observation is misleading.  Most modern societies consider
homosexuality a mental illness.  For example, a 1992 survey by
the APA's Office of International Affairs in conjunction with
the APA Committee of Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Psychiatrists
surveyed 125 psychiatric associations around the world.  It found
that all but three associations consider homosexuality a mental
illness or a sexual deviation.  U.S. psychiatrists are joined
only by Denmark and South Africa in their efforts to redefine
homosexuality and protect the &quot;right&quot; of homosexual
adults to conduct consensual sexual relations in private.[41]
<P>
<B>10. Misrepresents the pathological implications of
homosexuality.</B> The article cites a 1945 study of 183 former
college students known to be homosexual who served in the military
during World War II.  Sixty-four percent of these people &quot;served
with credible records.&quot;  The review also attributes the military's
decision no longer to view homosexuality as a mental illness to
the APA's 1973 decision to remove homosexuality from the Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Psychiatric Disorders-II.[42]
<P>
The article states that only 64 percent of homosexuals in their
study had credible service records.  Rather than being an indication
of success, this should be an argument for exclusion.  Better
than 90 percent of the 8.5 million World War II era veterans &quot;served
with credible records.&quot;  
<P>
The implication is that since 64 percent in a single study had
&quot;credible&quot; records, there is no justification for the
exclusion.  This proves nothing.  They were honored for their
&quot;credible&quot; service to their country, not their homosexual
behavior.  After all, the ban was in force, so homosexuals were
forced to curb their behavior. 
<P>
The history of the American Psychiatric Association's decision
to change the DSM-II is worth examining.  Specifically, the military's
World War II experience provided considerable insight into human
behavior.  Specialists in military medicine literally rewrote
the diagnostic codes and nomenclature for psychiatric disorders
which, ultimately, became the format used by the American Psychiatric
Association in the 1980s and 1990s.  In 1952 the APA Council approved
and published a new nomenclature for categorizing mental disorders
similar to those used by the military.  The nomenclature identified
homosexuality as a pathologic behavior, i.e., &quot;sexual deviation,&quot;
under the section on Sociopathic Personality Disturbances.[43]
<P>
The second edition of the DSM for Mental Disorders continued to
identify homosexuality as a &quot;sexual deviation&quot; disorder.
 And since 1945 the Army has consistently held that homosexuality
is a behavioral problem, not a mental disease.[44]
<P>
From 1969 to 1971, homosexual activists stormed the annual meetings
of the APA demanding the normalization of homosexual behavior.
 In 1971 homosexual activists invaded the annual meeting, screaming
and kicking, seizing microphones, and denouncing psychiatry as
&quot;the enemy incarnate.&quot;[45]
<P>
The DSM was challenged at the 1973 meeting of the New England
Psychiatric Society by homosexual activists.  They recommended
that the nomenclature's section on &quot;sexual deviation&quot;
be renamed &quot;sexual dysfunction.&quot;  Later that year APA
Trustees ruled that homosexuality would no longer be listed as
a &quot;mental disorder&quot; in its official nomenclature of
mental disorders and recommended that it be replaced by the term
&quot;sexual orientation disturbance.&quot;[46]
<P>
According to author Ronald Bayer in <I>Homosexuality and American
Psychiatry: The Politics of Diagnosis</I>, homosexual activists
used intimidation to force the APA to remove homosexuality as
a mental illness from the DSM of psychiatric disorders.  &quot;The
result was,&quot; explained Bayer, &quot;not a conclusion based
upon an approximation of the scientific truth as dictated by reason,
but was instead an action demanded by the ideological temper of
the times.&quot;[47]
<P>
Homosexuality was subsequently regarded as a variant of sexual
orientation disturbance.  The &quot;nomenclature revolution&quot;
continued and in 1986 the last remaining term, &quot;ego-dystonic
homosexuality,&quot; was removed from the DSM.  This was done
over the protest of many psychiatrists who preferred to label
it a long standing disturbance originating in the early years
of life.[48]
<P>
The membership of the American Medical Association disagreed with
the APA's decision.  A 1975 AMA membership survey found that 69
percent agreed that homosexuality is &quot;pathological.&quot;[49]
 Additionally, psychotherapists such as Elizabeth Moberly, Gerald
van den Aardweg, Joseph Nicolosi, Charles Socarides, and Masters
and Johnson have reported much success helping homosexuals to
recover, thereby proving the point that it is curable.[50]
<P>
<B>11. Claims military homosexuals would not contribute
to poor morale.</B>  The article proposes three points concerning
military morale.  First, it blames immature recruits for the anti-homosexual
policy but fails to cite supporting data.  &quot;Many recruits,
who may be insecure in their own sexual orientation, may react
with various forms of discomfort to the presence of an identified
homosexual person.&quot;[51] Second, it acknowledges that &quot;subcultures
in a military organization can disrupt functioning of the unit...since
the military copes with many subcultures, it remains for the military
to make a convincing case that this [homosexual] subculture is
substantially and essentially so much more damaging&quot; to justify
&quot;the costs of [the] current policy.&quot;[52] The military's
significant experience with drug and alcohol subcultures provides
ample experience with damaging categories of behavior.  Finally,
the authors state, &quot;We expect that acceptance of homosexuals
in the military will increase, negating the need for a walled-off
subculture and resulting in more respect for the homosexual soldier.&quot;[53]
 The authors provide no reason or basis for this supposition.
<P>
Morale is defined as &quot;a strong sense of enthusiasm and dedication
to a commonly shared goal that unifies a group.&quot;  Heterosexual
soldiers forced to live and work with avowed homosexuals cannot
be expected to do so with &quot;...a strong sense of enthusiasm.&quot;
<P>
Open homosexuals tend to bind their basic identity with their
sexual orientation and practice: &quot;I am a homosexual,&quot;
as opposed to the American soldier's basic identity: &quot;I am
a soldier.&quot;  The homosexual's preoccupation with individual
behavioral characteristics is incongruent with and detracts from
the commonly shared goal -- accomplishment of the mission -- which
unifies heterosexual soldiers and subordinates their individual
goals to that of the group.
<P>
The homosexual subculture is recognized as &quot;liberated&quot;
or, in a manner of speaking, undisciplined.  This is inherently
at odds with the 24-hour discipline system within which soldiers
must live and work.  Homosexuals are distinguished from other
subcultures by their behavior [sodomy].  Another group behavioral
characteristic is a very high rate of promiscuity.  Military records
indicate that homosexuals are statistically more likely to engage
in misconduct than heterosexuals.  They have a higher incidence
of drug and alcohol abuse than heterosexuals.  If these statistics
aren't enough, much-touted books such as Randy Shilts' <I>Conduct
Unbecoming</I> and Mary Ann Humphrey's <I>My Country, My Right
to Serve</I> provide, perhaps unwittingly, ample testimony to
the disruptive nature of homosexuals in military units.
<P>
The voice of experience also indicates that homosexuals jeopardize
military morale.  For example, a survey of active duty officers
conducted for the American Security Council Foundation found that
99.03 percent said homosexuals would undermine the cohesiveness
and readiness of combat units.[54] The Defense Readiness Council
compiled a survey of 2,800 retired flag and general officers.
 Nearly 90 percent said they believe homosexuals undermine morale.[55]
<P>
<B>12. Contends, against the evidence, that homosexuals
aren't a security risk</B>.  The article states that identifying
oneself as a homosexual is no more of a security risk than identifying
oneself as a heterosexual.  The authors call for the government
to show a &quot;nexus&quot; between the presence of homosexuals
and adverse impact on duty performance.[56]
<P>
This is a flawed argument.  Few people identify themselves as
heterosexual; that identity is assumed.  Homosexuals do, indeed,
identify themselves, however.
<P>
The article ignores the landmark research by Alan Bell and Martin
Weinberg, <I>Homosexualities: A Study of Diversity Among Men and
Women</I>, which found that a significant number of homosexuals
report that &quot;someone has threatened [them with] exposure
of homosexuality in order to get something of value.&quot;[57]
<P>
If the threat of blackmail was the only problem with homosexuals
in the military, then lifting the prohibition would be justified.
 However, for the many reasons cited in this analysis, homosexuals
should not serve openly and security investigations are a valid
mechanism for enforcing the ban.
<P>
<B>13. Contends, against overwhelming evidence, that homosexuals
are not a special health risk.</B>  The article virtually ignores
the documented health risks associated with the homosexual lifestyle,
citing only the military's HIV screening program.  &quot;By policy,&quot;
the authors explain, &quot;no one who tests positive for the HIV
virus is allowed to enter active duty.&quot;[58]
<P>
Admitting open homosexuals into the military violates the legal
principle of the assumption of risk.  This principle states that
if you know there is a risk and you assume it, then don't complain
when the risk materializes.  The review's authors denigrate a
very serious risk.
<P>
A recent report from the University of Michigan found that people
with HIV are more capable of spreading the virus during the first
60 days of infection, but that blood tests during this period
do not find the HIV.[59] This means that the military assumes the
risk, even though all personnel are initially tested, that soldiers
will not be infected.  This is why screening out high-risk groups
and not just those who test positive for HIV is smart.  Unfortunately,
the Clinton Administration no longer screens out homosexuals --
the highest-risk group for contracting HIV.
<P>
The Army's Surgeon General, Lieutenant General Alcide Lanoue,
addressed the health risks associated with homosexuals:[60]
<P>
&quot;The military setting provides unique requirements for
safety in executing the Army blood transfusion program and for
preventing the transmission of blood-borne pathogens (especially
HIV and hepatitis B) in the field setting.  Homosexual males would
comprise a pool of ineligible blood donors and as a group are
at high risk of infection by HIV and hepatitis B, both significant
blood-borne pathogens which can infect other soldiers through
exposure to blood in peace and war.&quot; [During Operation Desert
Storm, there were five documented instances where blood was drawn
from soldiers and transfused.  In Somalia, five units of blood
were drawn and directly transfused to Somalis.  The urgency of
such transfusions precludes testing for the AIDS virus.]
<P>
&quot;HIV and other Sexually Transmitted Disease rates will
increase to the extent that the proportion of homosexual males
in the Army increases because homosexual/bisexual men are allowed
to enter and remain in the Army.&quot;  [The CDC reports that
most of the AIDS patients in this country are homosexuals.[61] Homosexuals
account for a disproportionate number of America's most serious
STD's, including syphilis, gonorrhea, genital warts, and hepatitis
A and B.[62] Moreover, the 1994 homosexual sex survey in <I>The Advocate</I>,
a leading homosexual magazine, found that 13 percent of respondents
were HIV-positive and only 18 percent had taken all three shots
in the hepatitis B vaccine series.  <I>The Advocate</I> article
admits &quot;Gay men are one of the top risk groups for being
exposed to hepatitis B.&quot;[63] ]
<P>
&quot;A male homosexual soldier is significantly more likely
than a heterosexual soldier to be nondeployable for medical reasons
related to HIV infection.  If HIV-infected, the soldier will be
permanently nondeployable.  Male homosexuals are more likely to
acquire sexually transmitted diseases which can render them nondeployable,
such as gonorrhea, syphilis, and hepatitis B.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Readiness from a medical standpoint will suffer if the restriction
is lifted.  The impact would be felt at the unit level, when the
homosexual soldier cannot train and deploy for health reasons.
 Likewise, the impact would be felt Army-wide in terms of the
military blood program and of the burden placed on the Army health
care system.&quot;
<P>
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, homosexuals
are especially vulnerable to contracting HIV.  They are a high-risk
group because of co-factors associated with their lifestyle. 
These include recreational drug use, homosexual sex, malnutrition,
prior incidents of sexually transmitted diseases, and, most significantly,
sexual promiscuity.  
<P>
Homosexuals who participate in unsafe sex practices with multiple
partners and without taking precautions are at great risk of contracting
sexually transmitted diseases.  <I>The Advocate</I> survey found
that 72 percent of homosexual respondents engage in insertive
oral intercourse, 46 percent insertive anal intercourse, 45 percent
receptive anal-oral sex, 48 percent in three-way sex, 24 percent
in group sex (4 or more), and 10 percent in sadomasochism.[64] Most
of the homosexuals in the survey admitted to having had more than
30 sex partners over their lifetime, and about a third (35 percent)
report more than 100 partners.  The survey also found that homosexual
men use condoms only 1 time in 4.[65]
<P>
Heterosexuals have fewer sex partners than homosexuals.  A 1988-1990
General Social Survey found that 91 percent of men 25 to 29 years
of age are heterosexually active.  Nineteen percent of these men
have had only one lifetime sex partner, 55 percent have had 2
to 19 lifetime partners, and 25 percent have had 20 or more lifetime
partners.[66]
<P>
The University of Chicago published a national sex survey in October,
1994, which found that 20 percent of men have had only one sex
partner in their lifetime, 21 percent have had 2 to 4 partners,
17 percent had 5 to 10 partners, 16 percent had 11 to 20, and
17 percent report having had 21 or more sex partners.[67] However,
that survey excluded men over 59, who constitute one-sixth of
the population and who typically have more conservative sex lives.
 Thus the real figures probably are even lower for the population
of all men.[68]
<P>
Homosexuality also increases medical costs.  With the ban in place,
openly homosexual inductees are turned away.  However, with the
ban lifted, a homosexual recruit could contract HIV within days
or have early-stage HIV, test negative at first, and be accorded
full medical benefits for the rest of his life.  This is about
$120,000 in direct medical costs per AIDS patient.[69]
<P>
Dr. Edmund Tramont, Associate Director for retroviral research
at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, published a 10-year projection
for HIV costs at $1.7 to $1.9 billion.[70]  However, he warns that
this is in 1989 dollars, is based on the present rate of new cases,
and assumes that only 60 percent of health care beneficiaries
will use the military health care system.  The potential 10-year
cost could rise to $5 billion if these assumptions are incorrect.[71]
 The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services indicates that
the lifetime cost of treating a person with AIDS -- from diagnosis
until death -- is $102,000.[72] The American Medical Association
estimated the per-person AIDS patient cost would rise to $386,000
by the year 2000 and to $639,000 by the year 2008.[73]
<P>
As of April 1993 the military had dealt with 8,832 HIV-positive
service members.  Most have been separated from the service, but,
at that time, 1,580 were still on active duty.  Their status precluded
them from deploying overseas and necessitated special assignments
and special medical care.[74]
<P>
Homosexuals also have a much shorter life expectancy than heterosexuals,
as indicated by a study of more than 6,400 obituaries in 16 homosexual
newspapers.  The average age of homosexuals who died from AIDS
is 39; from all other causes it is 41.[75]
<P>
Substance addiction and abuse are called the second set of key
health problems after AIDS in the homosexual subculture (and violence
is third).[76]
<P>
Screening out homosexuals and discharging those discovered later
makes financial sense.  The 1992 GAO report states that the military
spent $26 million on homosexuals discharged.  The military spent
many times that figure treating homosexuals with AIDS -- people
who lied to enter the military and now receive full health and
pay benefits.  The cost-effective decision would be to minimize
the risk to the federal taxpayer by rejecting homosexuals before
they are recruited and discharging those later discovered.
<P>
<B>14. Cites legal challenges as indication that public
will soon favor homosexual service.</B>  The article briefly reviews
the current judicial climate regarding the military policy.  The
authors believe, &quot;With the increased public attention now
focused on the miliary policy, swift changes could sweep away
previous positions.&quot;[77]
<P>
The article cites two cases won by the government and the case
of Navy Petty Officer Keith Meinhold, who was discharged for saying
he was gay on national television.  Meinhold's case was labeled
&quot;the most recent legal case decided.&quot;[78]
<P>
Meinhold's case is not the most recent case decided.  The case
of former midshipman Joseph C. Steffan from the U.S. Naval Academy
was decided by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
on November 22, 1994.  The decision from the country's &quot;second
highest court&quot; declared the military's homosexual ban constitutional.[79]
<P>
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco ruled August
31, 1994 that a statement of homosexuality alone is insufficient
reason to discharge Meinhold.  That decision was limited only
to sailor Meinhold and struck down the lower court's decision
to extend the ruling to the entire Defense Department.[80]
<P>
Although numerous cases of former service members discharged for
homosexuality are now in the judicial system, there is no indication
that &quot;swift changes&quot; will &quot;sweep away previous
positions.&quot;  On the contrary, it is expected that the 104th
Congress will force the Clinton Administration to enforce the
homosexual law despite rulings that are in conflict with the law.
<P>
The issue of homosexuals in the military was cited as one of the
pivotal issues that collapsed the Democratic Party's majority
in Congress.  The new majority should respond by reinstating the
full homosexual ban, i.e., require the Clinton Administration
to obey the new homosexual law and to reintroduce the questions
for recruits at induction.
<P>
<B>15. Concludes that the ban is based solely on bad attitudes.</B>
 The article states, &quot;The strongest argument for excluding
and separating homosexual persons from military service is 
not mental illness or security risks but the presence of social
strictures and adverse attitudes.&quot;[81]
<P>
The authors ignore a wealth of information that comes from Congress's
oversight hearings in 1993.  Reasons include combat readiness
(cohesion, deployability risk, family and community risks); manpower
(recruitment and retention risks); cost (medical, housing, claims
from soldiers previously discharged for homosexuality, quality
of force sustainment, and lost productivity); and political (military
used as laboratory for social experimentation to satisfy the political
views of a small minority).  The article completely ignores these
concerns.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CONCLUSION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
&quot;Homosexuality and the Military&quot; is an article that
was rushed to press, was poorly reviewed, and does little for
the academic credibility of the APA -- an organization that should
be promoting sound research, not a moral agenda that abuses and
neglects available research.  The article is evidence that the
APA is playing an ever greater role in the promotion of the homosexual
agenda.

<P>
In the welfare debate last year, President Clinton himself stated
that &quot;the real source of [the] problem is the inordinate
number of out-of-wedlock births in this country.&quot;[1]  He also
conceded that &quot;there's no question that [ending welfare for
unwed mothers] would work.  The question is... 'Is it morally
right?'&quot;[2]
<P>
While the President's proposed policies leave much to be desired,
he has formulated precisely the right question to frame the current
debate over welfare reform in general and illegitimacy in particular.
 There can be no more important policy objective than the preservation
-- or more properly in this day and age, the revitalization --
of our nation's moral capital.  As James Q. Wilson wrote in his
oft-cited article, &quot;The Rediscovery of Character: Private
Virtue and Public Policy&quot;:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The essential first step is to acknowledge that at root, in almost
every area of important public concern, we are seeking to induce
persons to act virtuously....  Not only is such conduct desirable
in its own right, it appears now to be necessary if large improvements
are to be made in those matters we consider problems.[3]</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
There exists a striking public consensus that the welfare state's
practice of subsidizing illegitimacy is not only a massive problem,
but a moral problem at root.
<P>
Even so unlikely a source as Bruce Reed, President Clinton's leading
aide on welfare reform, acknowledges that the essential purpose
of reform must be to reverse the alarming rise in out-of-wedlock
births.[4]  If not driven exclusively by AFDC &quot;benefits,&quot;
the increase has at least been sustained and perpetuated by the
expansion of a system that pays recipients to bear illegitimate
children.  Current trends indicate that by the year 2015 -- some
studies project as early as 2000 -- one of every two American
babies will be born to a single mother, and illegitimacy will
surpass divorce as the main cause of fatherlessness.  If a job
program succeeds in putting more unmarried welfare mothers to
work (which is unlikely on a sufficiently grand scale, given budget
constraints), we will still be left with roughly the same number 
of fatherless children.  While
Great Britain has already succeeded in implementing reforms that
make work economically more attractive than welfare, the reforms
of the 1980s have only served to underscore in both Britain and
America the fact that little progress can be made without addressing
the collapse of the family.[5]
<P>
No moral judgment even need be adduced to acknowledge that intact
families bestow upon individuals and communities advantages that
simply come no other way.  Empirical evidence amassed by social
scientists in the last ten years (and chronicled for popular consumption
by Barbara Dafoe Whitehead in her April 1993 <I>Atlantic</I> article,
&quot;Dan Quayle Was Right&quot;) has confirmed in exquisite detail
what those who have lived in broken families already know.  A
single woman with children is not a viable economic unit for the
vast majority, but children need biological fathers for much more
than the extra dollars they add to the family budget.  As social
scientist Charles Murray has written, single parenthood is &quot;damaging
to children in so many ways that to list them individually would
be to trivialize them.&quot;[6]
<P>
Not surprisingly, Dr. Murray also concludes that &quot;illegitimacy
is the single most important social problem of our time...because
it drives everything else.&quot;[7]  More than 70 percent of all
juveniles in state reform institutions, for example, come from
fatherless homes; and the relationship between crime and one-parent
families is so powerful that controlling for family structure
erases the relationship between crime and race and between crime
and low income.  Illegitimacy feeds itself, too.  Young white
women who grow up without a father in the home are more than twice
as likely to bear children out-of-wedlock and to do so during
their teenage years when they are most likely to form long-term
attachments to AFDC.
<P>
If those on the welfare rolls have suffered most conspicuously,
it is also true that the welfare system has corrupted the ideals
and narrowed the vision of many who live well beyond the bounds
of the inner city -- even as it is now threatening our most cherished
civic institutions.  One obvious casualty is the weakening of
our conviction that the so-called &quot;bourgeois virtues&quot;
are available to all, regardless of race or class.  Early American
social workers, like Mary Ellen Richmond, understood the importance
of middle class norm-setting.  &quot;The way to reintegrate the
deviant into society, she argued, is to educate and indeed direct
them toward the shared values of the mainstream culture.&quot;[8]
<P>
The role of the traditional two-parent family is essential in
sustaining the institutions of a free society precisely because
it is the vehicle by which values are transmitted from generation
to generation.  If the family fails to impart virtues that temper
and restrain behavior, broad legal freedoms must give way.  So,
too, human dignity and equality, as the Founders understood them.
 Virtue, historian Gertrude Himmelfarb has said, is the only true
basis of equality and the only requisite for citizenship.[9]  As
Charles Murray made clear in his now famous op-ed &quot;The Coming
White Underclass,&quot; either we act now to reduce illegitimacy
and to reinfuse our public policy with a commitment to higher
and nobler things -- or we run the risk of sabotaging the entire
experiment in democratic self-government.
<P>
Or, as Michael Novak put it:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>[T]he project of self-government depends on the capacity of citizens
to govern their own passions, urges, habits, and expectations.
 If they cannot govern their own lives individually, how can they
be successful in self-government as a republic?  The project of
self-government is moral -- or not at all.[10]</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The Founding Fathers and many succeeding generations understood
that only a virtuous people can be free.  Do we?
<P>
Given the consequences for the individual child, the surrounding
community, and the national polity, bringing a baby into this
world without a sense of sacred responsibility cannot long be
regarded as a morally neutral act.  In a report issued in December
1994, the Progressive Policy Institute, policy arm of the Democratic
Leadership Council, joined others in acknowledging that &quot;it
is wrong -- not simply foolish or impractical -- for women and
men to make babies they cannot support emotionally and financially.&quot;[11]
 Donna Shalala made the same concession a year earlier, however
reluctantly, when she said in an interview, &quot;I don't like
to put this in moral terms, but I do believe that having children
out-of-wedlock is wrong.&quot;[12]
<P>
Congress should now recognize that it is also wrong to sanction
such activity by subsidizing it.  Republican strategist Bill Kristol
has said that &quot;neither our politics nor our sociology can
ultimately be neutral as to the content of the _laws of Nature
and Nature's God,_&quot;[13] chief among which is the fact that
we were made to live in families.  Charles Murray asks rhetorically:
 if &quot;a social policy that induces people to believe that
they are not responsible for their lives is one that inhibits
the pursuit of happiness and is to that extent immoral[,] [c]an
then a policy that <I>fails</I> to stigmatize be a moral one?&quot;[14]
<P>
Historical experience, related by Marvin Olasky and others, does
indeed demonstrate that the most effective social services have
been offered by private community groups, without any illusion
of moral neutrality.  In her seminal historical study <I>Poverty
and Compassion</I>, Gertrude Himmelfarb writes that:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>[a]fter making the most arduous attempt to objectify the problem
of poverty, to divorce poverty from any moral assumptions and
conditions, we are learning how inseparable the moral and material
dimensions of that problem are.  And after trying to devise social
policies that are scrupulously neutral and _value-free,_ we are
finding these policies fraught with moral implications that have
grave material and social consequences.[15]</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
George Liebmann says, more simply, in a recent issue of <I>The
American Enterprise</I>, &quot;Rescuing an underclass is by definition
a highly moralistic undertaking.&quot;[16]  While controlling welfare
spending is a happy byproduct of terminating benefits to teen
mothers, even more promising is the opportunity to begin reversing
the message of the counterculture that has so eroded the character
of our people, in part by assaulting the family.
<P>
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan has used the phrase &quot;defining
deviancy down&quot; to describe Americans' tendency to ignore
excess levels of deviancy by normalizing what used to be considered
pathology.  Only by &quot;defining deviancy down&quot; have we
been able to ignore until now all the signs of impending disaster
that attend a burgeoning illegitimacy rate.  Barbara Whitehead's
1993 <I>Atlantic</I> article heralded a real and significant change
in the public mood, however; and the near-mythic ascendancy of
Charles Murray's &quot;Coming White Underclass&quot; piece the
same year seemed to confirm a general convergence of public opinion.
 In a recent Family Research Council survey of 1,000 Americans,
a substantial majority (81 percent) of respondents indicated that
&quot;women having babies out of wedlock that they can't support
financially&quot; is a serious problem.  The mounting public consensus
presents a unique opportunity to implement more than symbolic
change in the 104th Congress and to make sanctions against illegitimacy
the focus of that change.
<P>
In sending his welfare package to Congress more than 30 years
ago, President Kennedy articulated contemporary liberals' fundamental
misunderstanding of the causal role welfare plays in boosting
illegitimacy rates.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>[W]elfare programs, [he said], must contribute to the attack
on . . . family breakdown [and] illegitimacy. . . .  Unless such
problems are dealt with effectively, they fester, and grow, sapping
the strength of society as a whole and extending their consequences
in troubled families from one generation to the next.[17]</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Kennedy's insight about the consequences has proven historically
accurate; but his &quot;service&quot; approach to curbing illegitimacy
worked no better than the current President's will -- a fact which
an unnamed aide on the Clinton welfare task force acknowledged
last year.
<P>
While the President advocates a massive and expensive public relations
campaign against out-of-wedlock births, his aide confided to <I>Newsweek</I>
reporter Joe Klein: &quot;We looked at a hundred different programs
around the country that were trying to deal with this problem,
and not one of them moved the needle.  There just weren't any
results.&quot;[18]  Likewise, a formal study of the Teenage Parent
Demonstration, sponsored by the Department of Health and Human
Services in response to &quot;persistently high rates of teenage
pregnancies and births,&quot; found that &quot;[t]he program had
an unusual and disappointing pattern of impacts on pregnancy and
birth rates . . . despite . . . the substantial efforts of the
programs to empower [the] young mothers to take control of their
fertility.&quot;[19]
<P>
Charles Murray anticipated the problem in his 1988 book <I>In
Pursuit of Happiness and Good Government</I>.  &quot;The task,&quot;
he concludes, &quot;is not to devise a public relations campaign
to discourage single teenage girls from having babies, but to
neutralize whatever is impeding the age-old impulse of human beings
to form families.&quot;[20]  Eliminating grants to unwed teenage
mothers will be necessary, but not sufficient, to restore the
integrity of the family unit.
<P>
Only by historical accident were unwed mothers -- of any age --
ever included in the AFDC program.  Frances Perkins, President
Roosevelt's Secretary of Labor and chief architect of welfare
policy, opposed extending federal entitlements to unmarried mothers
because she foresaw that subsidizing illegitimacy would escalate
family breakdown.  It would be ironic at best if the current majority
in Congress were to find themselves to the left of the most liberal
member of the Roosevelt Administration because they rejected that
intuition, now confirmed by years of sad experience.  It is the
potential to reverse that sad experience that must define &quot;compassion&quot;
in the present debate.  As the one policy option that promises
to effect change in the current system, restrictions on benefits
by definition constitute the compassionate alternative.
<P>
Himmelfarb notes that the word &quot;compassion&quot; once described
&quot;a moral sentiment, not a political principle, a sentiment
evoked by _misery_ or _sorrow,_ not by poverty as such.&quot;[21]
 As political salvationism sought to preempt traditional morals
in the last 30 years, it was only natural that moral sentiments
should be confused with political principles.  Likewise, that
misery and sorrow should be equated with material poverty; for
the redefinition of compassion required a highly artificial view
of man as no more than a material being.
<P>
If compassion is once again properly understood, perhaps then
it will become more obvious that the object of our concern must
be &quot;misery&quot; and &quot;sorrow,&quot; not economic poverty,
and that the &quot;misery&quot; most evident today is the spiritual
and moral deprivation visited upon dependents of the welfare system.
 It is time that we stop suppressing the moral responsibilities
that make life precious for a resident of the inner city just
the same as for a middle-class suburbanite.  It is time, in short,
to secure equal access to the central satisfactions of family,
virtue, and freedom.

<P>
Again, in the course of the welfare debate, the abortion issue
has demonstrated its unique capacity to mobilize and divide.
<P>
Pro-life advocates who resist the so-called family cap, which
would freeze benefits to mothers who bear additional illegitimate
children while on welfare, fear with some justification that the
cap could promote an increase in abortions.  Pro-life advocates
who support the measure share both this concern and the long-term
goal of driving abortions to the point of zero.  Unlike the more
conventional conflict between pro-life and pro-choice groups,
pro-life differences over the family cap represent a dispute over
means, not ends, that is complicated by the absence of any hard
data from actual experimentation.
<P>
Such differences lend themselves to reasoned discussion and, ultimately,
resolution far more easily than the larger debate for and against
abortion rights, which Laurence Tribe has characterized as a &quot;clash
of absolutes.&quot;  While the choice between life and death cannot
be accurately described as a &quot;clash of absolutes,&quot; the
phrase does capture usefully the impossibility of winning adherents
to the pro-life cause without first changing hearts, one at a
time.  In other words, we should forfeit no battles, but neither
can we expect to win the war against abortion on demand without
a comprehensive, long-term strategy to develop and sustain a pro-life
consensus.
<P>
While a pro-life position must be part of the agenda for national
renewal, opposition to abortion must be only one plank of the
pro-life platform.  A crisis as broad and deep as abortion on
demand requires a transformation of the political and moral culture
as well as a reform of law.  Reducing illegitimacy is the <I>sine
qua non</I> of moral reconstruction; and right-to-life activists
should realize that, as one of the few weapons in the anti-illegitimacy
arsenal, the family cap not only serves their cause in the long-term
but deserves their active support in the short-term -- subject
to the critical qualification that there must be no attendant
funding for abortions.
<P>
No hard data are available to demonstrate that the family cap
stimulates the abortion rate.  And there is reason to think that
the family cap will <I>not</I> increase abortions, even in the
short-term.    
<P>
Feminists and welfare rights activists argue that the current
benefits level is already far too low to cover the costs associated
with a new baby.  If so, it is illogical to maintain that a cap
would have a sufficiently significant impact on the &quot;affordability&quot;
of another child to necessitate such a drastic measure as abortion.
<P>
The decision to abort, anyhow, is far more than an economic calculation.
 Twenty years of spiraling illegitimacy rates in the face of liberalized
abortion laws demonstrate that many individuals do not regard
abortion as a viable option.  Policy data collected by the Family
Research Council suggest that abortion is even less acceptable
to poor women;[1] and an article recently published in <I>Family
Planning Perspectives</I> found that abortion rates for teen welfare
mothers are <I>lower</I> than national averages for all teenage
girls.[2]
<P>
Those who are tempted to conclude that it is the availability
of welfare checks that reduces the abortion rate, relative to
the general population, should keep in mind the basis of comparison.
 That hypothesis -- that limited cash benefits suppress the abortion
rate -- would predict a <I>lower</I> rate of abortion in the general
population, relative to welfare mothers, because the average member
of the general population has more economic resources at her disposal.
 The empirical data, however, refute the hypothesis; and Douglas
Besharov of the American Enterprise Institute has commented that,
to the contrary, &quot;[k]ids who have less to lose . . . are
less likely to have an abortion.&quot;[3]       
<P>
The finding that abortion rates for teen welfare mothers are lower
than national averages for all teenage girls is a powerful suggestion
that non-economic factors determine the decision to carry a child
to term.  Other research supports the claim that, whether conception
was intended or not, most illegitimate births to underclass women
today are &quot;wanted.&quot;[4] Certainly, there is ample anecdotal
evidence to suggest that some girls have babies because they want
&quot;something to love&quot; -- or, worse yet, because their
peer group has perversely defined a baby as a status symbol.[5]
<P>
Others, including the young welfare mother who testified before
a recent congressional hearing on illegitimacy, simply believe
that abortion is wrong and choose not to compound their first
mistake by committing another.  While poverty dispirits some lives,
in others it serves to highlight the intangibles that make life
most sacred.  The point of decrying moral deterioration among
the underclass is to assert an easily forgotten truth: every person,
regardless of economic status, is capable of the very moral commitments
that argue most forcefully against abortion.
<P>
Even assuming that our ultimate objective is to save as many lives
as possible, it is by no means clear that the appropriate operational
measure of success in assessing the family cap would be the number
of lives saved in the short-term -- if such a number could be
approximated in the future as it cannot be now.  The question
itself is a red herring because it obscures the larger and more
important issue: &quot;What constitutes progress toward ending
altogether the culture that finds abortion acceptable?&quot;
<P>
Deciding on a rational means to maximize the total number of lives
saved in fact requires two sets of measures for maximizing that
good -- human lives saved in the short-term and human lives saved
over the course of several generations.  Since the policy changes
under consideration affect illegitimacy and the structure of the
welfare system, the number of lives saved in the long-run should
include both children who would have been aborted as well as the
children who would have fallen prey to the violent crime that
results from, as James Q. Wilson put it, &quot;neglecting the
processes by which the underclass reproduces itself.&quot;[6]
<P>
While there is no point at which the short-term perspective loses
relevance, few would dispute that there exists some point at which
the long-term implications demand consideration.  If it is true
that preserving the current benefits package will save lives,
presumably we could save even more lives by increasing the entitlements
tenfold.  Yet, most right-to-life activists intuitively understand
that there is an alternative good to be served by restricting
benefits that will in no way compromise our commitment to life.
<P>
Charles Murray wrote in his 1988 book <I>In Pursuit of Happiness
and Good Government</I>, in a passage that defined the parameters
and the language of the above analysis: &quot;It cannot be . .
. that the objective of a program is to save lives.  It may be
the <I>operational</I> measure of success, but it cannot be the
<I>construct</I> . . . because it has no discriminatory power.
. . .  One can too easily think of measures that will save lives
efficiently but are also totalitarian.&quot;[7]
<P>
The construct we are really interested in is &quot;advancing the
pro-life cause,&quot; which we may attempt to operationalize by
estimating the total number of lives saved now and later as a
result of the proposed policy change -- in this case, the family
cap.  And there is no question that reducing illegitimacy by imposing
restrictions on welfare benefits will serve the over-arching purpose
of the pro-life movement.
<P>
As Chuck Donovan explained in a paper published by the Family
Research Council, it is a basic statistical fact that marital
status and the abortion rate are inextricably linked.  The vast
majority of abortions are performed on unmarried women -- and
the proportion is growing.  To reduce abortions, therefore, we
should reduce the premarital sex and out-of-wedlock pregnancy
that create a perceived &quot;need&quot; for abortion.
<P>
Right-to-life activists who oppose measures to reduce illegitimacy
are helping to sustain the very system that encourages young women
to find themselves in the predicament that makes abortion seem
as attractive as it possibly could.  Opposition to the family
cap is a curiously negative way to affirm life.  Although it should
be noted that many pro-life advocates are the ones on the front
lines offering material assistance to unwed mothers who do decide
to keep their babies, it would be far more compassionate to try
to preclude the need for that help in the first place.
<P>
Glenn Loury and James Q. Wilson argued convincingly at recent
welfare hearings before the Human Resources subcommittee that
the problems of illegitimacy and abortion are moral -- not material
-- problems.  They require spiritual solutions which no government
can provide directly.  Yet, Loury writes, &quot;in every community
there are agencies of moral and cultural development that seek
to shape the ways in which individuals conceive of their duties
to themselves, of their obligations to each other, and of their
responsibilities before God.&quot;[8]
<P>
In many communities, right-to-life organizations are those very
agencies, and they deserve credit and gratitude they don't often
receive.  By gradually eliminating federal benefits, poor women
who are pregnant out of wedlock will be forced to turn to local
organizations, including right-to-life crisis pregnancy groups,
that will counsel against abortion and discourage further irresponsible
behavior.
<P>
Launching the arguments against illegitimacy in the context of
the current debate over those benefits will give new rhetorical
emphasis and more widespread attention to the arguments against
abortion; for, the two ills spring from the same misconception
that life is cheap and motherhood bears no sacred responsibility.
 Indeed, the bipartisan focus on illegitimacy is one of the most
golden opportunities we have had in quite some time to reverse
the message of the counterculture that has made abortion &quot;rights&quot;
seem palatable.
<P>
Yet, to increase the logic and appeal of pro-life arguments to
a significant number of people who do not now see the moral force
in such arguments, we must begin the task of rebuilding other
civic institutions that will nourish human souls and liberate
them to fulfill their full potential.  Such an ambitious project
will require a multifaceted strategy, and eliminating the welfare
benefits that encourage illegitimacy will be a key component of
that strategy.
<P>
The interconnections linking functioning communities with functioning
families are so rife and so apparent that even Democrats now concede
Dan Quayle was right.  Illegitimacy, by definition, is the failure
of families to form in the first place; and by driving a host
of social problems that corrode communities and erode the national
character, illegitimacy promotes the failing of family on a grand
scale.
<P>
Charles Murray writes that affiliation -- including family affiliation
-- is a means whereby people of common values are enabled to enact
those values.  A functioning community that promotes a wide array
of affiliations provides an extremely important venue both for
practicing virtue and for passing down to the next generation
the habit of virtue.[9] The pro-life movement is itself a classic
example of people expressing their interests and values through
affiliations that are sustained by a rich network of institutions
outside of -- and sometimes even in opposition to -- government.
<P>
Arguably, members of the underclass do not now have the same type
of privilege; but they should and could if we begin, in Michael
Joyce's words, &quot;the resuscitation of the civic sphere which
alone makes genuine citizenship possible.&quot;[10] Because civil
institutions are the very institutions that cultivate character,
that &quot;appeal to and sustain spirit and heart as much as mind,&quot;[11]
reconstructing them will engender a far more lasting commitment
to pro-life principles than obstruction of the family cap.  Michael
Joyce has explained eloquently: &quot;Through . . . countless,
subtle, daily interactions, our civil institutions give form and
substance to the everyday qualities and values without which life
itself would be impossible.&quot;[12]
<P>
Paradoxical as it may seem, reforming the culture will be the
most expedient complementary strategy for winning new and permanent
legal victories against abortion.  If any issue position depends
on one's idea of man, it is abortion.  And an individual's idea
of man is not something that gives way to clever arguments in
court or the Congress.  Instead, it is shaped and formed from
childhood by the quiet but pervasive messages of the surrounding
society in which children grow and develop into adults.
<P>
In addition to changing notions of the individual, we must also
change the related conception of government.  If we succeed in
restoring a commitment to limited government, the courts will
be under increasing pressure to reverse the abortion decisions
that have, in George Weigel and Bill Kristol's analysis, &quot;[reduced]
the actors in American society to the coercive state and the radically
autonomous individual, bereft of all social ties and responsibilities.&quot;[13]
 There is no better way to undermine this &quot;America of strangers,&quot;
to use Richard John Neuhaus' phrase, than to restore the civil
institutions that nurture the daily interactions and affiliations
that are anathema to the proponents of centralized government.
<P>
Right-to-life advocates give collective voice to a magnificent
idealism in our political discourse.  To them, it does not matter
that a decrease in abortions will mean a disproportionate increase
in minority babies born to low-income parents.  It does matter
that abortions end innocent lives because life is eminently sacred
and precious.
<P>
Thus, pro-lifers should understand more fully than anyone in the
debate over the family cap that abortion is not an issue that
can be nickel-and-dimed or reduced to a scientific calculation
of anticipated marginal changes in the abortion rate.  The very
attempt threatens, however unintentionally, to promote the same
thoroughly dehumanized and despiritualized view of life in which
pro-abortion forces indulge.
<P>
If our objective is to find a rational means to maximize the number
of lives saved over time, it bears repeating that, for Aristotle,
&quot;conformity with a rational principle&quot; meant something
far more humane than a cold mathematical calculation of odds.
 He distinguished between &quot;theoretical wisdom,&quot; which
is more akin to a scientific process, and &quot;practical wisdom,&quot;
defined as &quot;the capacity of deliberating well about what
is good and advantageous.&quot;  Aristotle knew that in making
decisions the best of statesmen would draw upon this more indefinable
wisdom that is an equal but different part of rationality.  So
should we draw upon the best part of our wisdom in evaluating
the costs and benefits of the proposed family cap.[14]
<P>
We should also bear in mind that what we think about the right
to life has an organic relationship with our vision of the kind
of society we should institute.  In the end, it really is not
possible to think about one in isolation from the other; or else
the arguments lose impetus, grow artificial and -- lifeless.
<P>
Not by coincidence, the Declaration speaks of &quot;life&quot;
in the same breath with &quot;liberty&quot; and &quot;the pursuit
of happiness,&quot; two conditions that speak directly to the
question of how best to organize society.  The Founders instituted
a limited government to secure natural rights, including the right
to life; but as George Will noted in a recent editorial, &quot;Our
creed of limited government . . . [has a] corollary vision of
human capacities and of the life worth living,&quot; captured
by the phrase &quot;pursuit of happiness.&quot;[15]
<P>
The Founders would have scoffed at the notion that the protection
of life and limb alone is an adequate notion of &quot;happiness,&quot;
and right-to-life activists forget that at their peril in the
present debate over the family cap.  By opposing the current system
of welfare benefits, we advocate a transformation of the political
and social culture that will sustain both &quot;happiness&quot;
and a more enduring pro-life consensus than even legal reform
can hope to accomplish.

<title>GOALS 2000: THE CASE FOR REPEAL</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/insight/insight.gif">
<p>
<h2>GOALS 2000:<br>
THE CASE FOR REPEAL</h2>
<hr size = 3 width = 50%>
<p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>Jennifer A. Marshall</i></center>
<p>
To an ailing American education system, Goals 2000 offers further
centralization, added bureaucracy, and federal coercion -- and
calls it a prescription for local freedom.
<p>
But Americans have overwhelmingly objected to the &quot;government
knows best&quot; philosophy of which Goals 2000 is another manifestation.
If the 104th Congress intends to keep its campaign promises of
decentralizing authority, returning power to states and localities,
empowering American families, balancing the budget, and reducing
the deficit, then Goals 2000 must be repealed. It is an impediment
to these goals. Leaving intact the Goals 2000 formula for restructuring
American education will undo any education reform Congress hopes
to accomplish.
<p>
Goals 2000 (P.L. 103-227) is the Clinton Administration's plan
to drastically restructure the American education system. &quot;Goals
2000 establishes overall direction for a new local-state-federal
partnership in education,&quot; writes Gordon M. Ambach, executive
director of the Council of Chief State School Officers.[1] It increases
the federal role by imposing a congressional formula for reform
on any state, school district, or school that wishes to receive
funding under this act.
<p>
The priority of the restructuring agenda can be seen in the appropriations.
Less than half the funding for Goals 2000 will reach local schools
in this first year of its existence. Of the $105 million appropriated
for Goals 2000 in FY 94, $92.4 million (88 percent) is targeted
toward state grants. Stipulations in the law require that only
45 percent of each state's grant be filtered down to individual
schools.[2] That means only $42 million, or 40 percent of the original
appropriation, will ever reach the schools. The other 60 percent
constitutes the bureaucratic skim that is being used at each level
to create the new framework for the educational system.
<p>
The danger of the Goals 2000 restructuring agenda is that all
future federal experimentation with education will be easily inculcated
into the new network. Local schools will be extremely vulnerable
to manipulation and have little, if any, autonomy.
<p>
The bureaucratic waste and ominous restructuring agenda of Goals
2000 are just the beginning of the argument against this legislation
that will radically change American education. Its ten titles
contain dozens of problem areas that warrant the repeal of Goals
2000.
<p>
<center><h3>TITLE I -- NATIONAL EDUCATION GOALS</h3></center>
<p>
This title codifies eight national education goals. Six were agreed
to in 1990 by governors and President Bush following the Charlottesville
education summit. The other two goals, parental participation
and teacher education, were added as bait to sell the Goals 2000
legislation to interest groups, such as teacher unions and the
PTA, which supposedly represent the views of teachers and parents.
<p><ul>
<li>The concept of national education goals is based on faulty
logic. If the federal government is setting goals, that presupposes
that it has the authority and ability to ensure the accomplishment
of the goals. Reaching national education goals will require an
unprecedented federal intrusion in schools.
<p>
<li>Had the goals been popularly developed and had Americans
asked for federal supervision in achieving them, Goals 2000 might
be procedurally, if not philosophically, a legitimate plan. They
did not and it is not. Secretary Riley reveals this as he retells
the history of the Goals 2000 legislation:
<p><ul>
In the first place, educators had not been in on the ground floor
when the National Education Goals were developed in 1989 and 1990.
The goals were viewed by many as a classic example of a top-down
reform imposed on localities.... Nor had parents, citizens, or
the business community been brought into the picture in a meaningful
way.... Finally, neither members of Congress nor state legislators
had a hand in crafting the goals.... The truth was that the reform
movement at the national level had absolutely no statutory basis....
The National Education Goals, three years after their announcement,
had no legal standing of any kind.[3]
</ul><p>
<li>National education goals cannot be reached through a <I>voluntary</I>
program. If the Clinton Education Department intends to reach
these goals, they certainly cannot believe that Goals 2000 is
voluntary, or at least they do not intend that it will be optional
for long. The goals are stated in section 102 using all-inclusive
language: &quot;all students will leave grades 4, 8, and 12 having
demonstrated competency over challenging subject matter...,&quot;
and &quot;every school in the United States will be free of drugs....&quot;
These goals absolutely cannot be accomplished through a voluntary
program. The crafters of this legislation were either deceived
or deceptive when they touted Goals 2000 as voluntary.
</ul><p>
<center><h3>TITLE II -- NATIONAL EDUCATION REFORM LEADERSHIP,<br>
STANDARDS AND ASSESSMENTS</h3></center>
<p>
Understanding title II is key to understanding the significance
and danger of the Goals 2000 legislation. This title is the heart
of the restructuring agenda. It creates two new national bureaucracies:
the National Education Goals Panel (NEGP) and the National Education
Standards and Improvement Council (NESIC).
<p>
The driving force of the Goals 2000 reform plan lies in title
II: <I>standards</I>. Three types of national standards are defined:
content standards, performance standards and opportunity-to-learn
standards. In order to apply for a grant under Goals 2000, each
state must develop its own content, performance and opportunity-to-learn
standards, or adopt the national standards in each of the three
areas (see title III).
<p>
Title II is very problematic for anyone who believes in a decentralized
system of education:
<p><ul>
<li>Clearly, adding bureaucracy is contrary to the goals of
this Congress. It will not lead to better education, only waste.
<p>
<li>Goals 2000 called for the creation of the National Education
Standards and Improvement Council (NESIC) within 120 days of the
law's enactment (March 31, 1994) [Sec. 212(e)]. The council was
not named during that time, nor has it been since then, yet in
FY 94 $2 million was appropriated for its use. To what end were these
funds used?
<p>
<li>NESIC was to &quot;identify areas in which voluntary national
content standards need to be developed&quot; [Sec. 213(a)(1)(A)].
Since NESIC has not been formed it obviously has not performed
this function. Which bureaucrat decided what standards projects
would be funded? With such anonymity there is no accountability.
<p>
<li>The content standards are being presented to school personnel
and the general public as though they have been officially and
legally approved. Neither of these can happen because the body
set up by law to certify the standards -- NESIC -- does not exist.
It is misleading to present these as <I>the</I> &quot;national
standards&quot; when they have been neither federally nor popularly
approved.
</ul><p>
The <I>National Standards for United States History,</I> produced
by the Center for History in the Schools, are a case in point.
A politically correct account of American history, these standards
are being presented to history teachers as <I>the national standards</I>.
While Congress may believe it has addressed the issue with the
Senate's 99 to 1 vote to reject the U.S. history standards, this
non-binding resolution was merely symbolic. In Goals 2000, Congress
gave authority over the standards to NESIC. That makes the Senate's
resolution only a good gesture. Congress should follow this vote
to reject the history standards with a vote of much greater significance:
the repeal of the entire Goals 2000 legislation, which calls for
national standards and has the potential to produce more material
like the U.S. history standards.
<p><ul>
<li>The federal government should not be involved in the creation
of standards. Government-endorsed standards are by nature coercive,
not voluntary, and will create a body of &quot;official knowledge.&quot;
This is contrary to the American tradition of freedom of thought.
Furthermore, content standards deal with curriculum, an area which
the federal Department of Education was expressly forbidden to
enter when it was created in 1979. The creation, critique and
usage of standards must remain a community endeavor. No further
federal money should be spent on standards projects, and there
should be no federal certification or endorsement of existing
standards. Political involvement results in politically-charged
standards. Imagine the reaction of those unoffended by the original
history standards if new standards were developed under the leadership
of Sen. Jesse Helms or Speaker Newt Gingrich.
</ul><p>
Opportunity-to-learn (OTL) standards are an especially troublesome
element of title II:
<p><ul>
<li>These standards shift the focus of reform back to increasing
inputs into education, a tried-and-failed method. OTL standards
chosen by states and school districts will require schools to
provide adequate resources -- including such things as gender-equitable
materials, curriculum aligned with national content standards,
and anything else NESIC deems appropriate.
<p>
<li>OTL standards are measuring sticks for schools and teachers,
not for students. They are not a reliable method for improving
student achievement. Indeed, numerous studies linking dramatically
increased spending and declining test scores indicate that spending
does not drive academic success.[4]
<p>
<li>OTL standards invite further federal intrusion in American
education. Diane Ravitch, an assistant secretary of education
in the Bush administration, wrote, &quot;[T]he new standards,
euphemistically called 'opportunity-to-learn' standards, would
permit Federal regulation of curriculum, textbooks, facilities
and instructional methods....The bill describes the Federal 'opportunity-to-learn'
standards as 'voluntary,' but litigation would quickly turn them
into mandates.&quot;[5]
</ul><p>
The idea of lawsuits and mandates is not an alarmist fabrication;
an Alabama state court recently declared the state school system
unconstitutional for not providing adequate education to its students.
The judge's 125-page opinion imposes OTL-type standards on the
state's schools.[6]
<p>
<center><h3>TITLE III -- STATE AND LOCAL EDUCATION<br>
SYSTEMIC IMPROVEMENT</h3></center>
<p>
This title authorizes block grants to states and subgrants to
local school boards [Sec. 309(a)].
<p><ul>
<li>In order to receive a grant under Goals 2000, a state is
obligated to adhere to the federal outline for reform: opportunity-to-learn
standards, content and performance standards, assessments, etc.
State improvement plans must be approved by the Secretary of Education.
Never before have states had to submit such lesson plans to the
federal government for approval. Contrary to the rhetoric of Goals
2000, this is not a formula for local authority over school reform;
it makes the word <I>voluntary</I> moot.
<p>
<li>In its grant application, a state must include &quot;an
assurance that State law provides adequate authority to carry
out each component of the State's improvement plan...&quot; [Sec.
305(a)(2)(B)]. In other words, the state must explain how it will
impose the Goals 2000 agenda on each of its school districts,
voiding the voluntary option for them as well.
<p>
<li>The Goals 2000 prescription for reform encourages states
to include plans to transform schools into &quot;one-stop shopping&quot;
centers which offer a variety of social services, including health
care and child care [Sec. 306(f)(2)]. This coordination of services
tends toward a collectivism which is contrary to our nation's
history as a free society. Concentrating the services in one place
and on one group of people may lead to a sense of dependency.
<p>
<li>Advancing social services, health care and related services
likely includes the promotion of school-based clinics (SBC). The
term &quot;coordinated services&quot; has been used by proponents
to refer to school-based clinics. These clinics commonly distribute
contraceptives and, when these measures fail, the clinics refer
for abortion.
</ul><p>
<center><h3>TITLE IV -- PARENTAL ASSISTANCE</h3></center>
<p>
This title provides for parental information and resource centers
and describes parental involvement in education. Laudable as it
sounds, this title is problematic:
<p><ul>
<li>Goal 8 (parental participation) and title IV (Parental
Assistance) assume that schools and parents have equal authority
over and responsibility for children. The legislation denies the
fact that parents' authority over their children is intrinsic
and that schools have only a delegated authority.
<p>
<li>To improve family life and help parents, Goals 2000 suggests
more programming, more meetings, more time at school and with
school personnel, and more home visits from professionals. All
of this leaves less time for parents and children to spend together.
<p>
<li>With their Goals 2000 grants, states must spend money on
&quot;parent education.&quot; Parents as Teachers (PAT), which
advocates home visits by counselors beginning at birth, is one
of the programs specifically endorsed by the law. Not only are
states encouraged to use their &quot;parent education&quot; money
to fund PAT programs, but the objectionable organization was directly
appropriated $10 million under Goals 2000 for FY 1995. The House
Education, Labor, HHS Subcommittee for Appropriations is to be
commended for targeting this program for termination. Its rationale
for proposing cuts to parent education programs is that &quot;these
are the very paternalistic and 'government knows best' programs
that the American people rejected last year.&quot;
<p>
<li>Publicly-funded institutions like PAT are not equipped
to improve families because they cannot speak to the values issues
inherent in the breakdown of families. Private voluntary associations
and individuals must take responsibility in this arena.
</ul><p>
<center><h3>TITLE V -- NATIONAL SKILL STANDARDS BOARD</h3></center>
<p>
Title V is devoted to linking education to business and industry.
It authorizes the creation of another national bureaucracy: the
National Skill Standards Board (NSSB). NSSB will establish business-education
partnerships and oversee development of skill standards and assessments.
<p><ul>
<li>The $3 million spent in 1994 to develop skill standards
is another misguided appropriation of funds. It also calls for
the development of national assessments to certify achievement
of the skill standards. These additions, however, will not produce
better candidates for business. According to a <I>Chicago Tribune</I>
article, employers seek critical thinking and creativity, but
when it comes to promoting those skills, &quot;most of the visible
school reform efforts, such as uniform national testing schemes,
head 180 degrees in the wrong direction.&quot;[7]
</ul><p>
<center><h3>TITLE VI -- INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION PROGRAM</h3></center>
<p>
Title VI calls for evaluation of foreign education systems. It
also sets up a program of education personnel exchange with central
and eastern European countries and any country formerly a part
of the Soviet Union.
<p><ul>
<li>The United States does not have the resources to &quot;provide
Department of Education personnel and technical experts to assist
eligible countries to establish and implement a database or other
effective methods to improve educational delivery systems, structure
and organization&quot; [Sec. 601(c)(5)]. Moreover, U.S. envoys
should not be pushing the Goals 2000 agenda, unproven in our own
country, on eastern European countries.
</ul><p>
<center><h3>TITLE VII -- SAFE SCHOOLS</h3></center>
<p>
This title provides grants to local school districts to achieve
safe and drug-free schools. Section 705 describes types of programs
to be implemented to prevent violence.
<p><ul>
<li>Conflict resolution, anger management, and peer mediation
are cited as &quot;programs of demonstrated effectiveness in addressing
violence&quot; (Sec. 705). In reality, experts are skeptical of
these soft-approach violence prevention programs.[8]
<p>
<li>We cannot afford to spend millions on a violence prevention
strategy that includes programs of no proven effectiveness. Serious
efforts must be made to curb violence, but conflict resolution
and peer mediation will not get to the real solution: changed
lives and families.
</ul><p>
<center><h3>TITLE VIII -- MINORITY-FOCUSED CIVICS EDUCATION</h3></center>
<p>
This title provides grants for teacher seminars on minority-focused
civics and government.
<p><ul>
<li>Minority-focused courses will likely promote versions of
history similar to that produced by the Center for History in
the Schools in its <I>National Standards for United States History.
</I>Such politicization of history will not produce acculturation
but cultural friction and fragmentation.
</ul><p>
<center><h3>TITLE IX -- EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH AND IMPROVEMENT</h3></center>
<p>
Title IX makes organizational changes in the Department of Education's
Office of Educational Research and Improvement (OERI); prescribes
OERI's functions in relation to Goals 2000; establishes within
OERI a National Educational Research Policy and Priorities Board,
five National Research Institutes, and a National Education Dissemination
System linking federal and local agencies. It also authorizes
expansion of research grants for comprehensive school health education
(Sec. 971).
<p><ul>
<li>Once again, Goals 2000 aims to improve education by adding
and reshuffling bureaucracy.
<p>
<li>Health education, which includes sex education, has already
been a major source of grief to parents. Advancing these programs
will undoubtedly lead to an increase in challenges to parental
authority.
</ul><p>
<center><h3>TITLE X -- MISCELLANEOUS</h3></center>
<p>
This catch-all title contains a gun-free school act, a non-smoking
policy for children's services in schools, a policy for distribution
of contraceptive devices, and authorization of grants for Midnight
Basketball programs.
<p><ul>
<li>The Goals 2000 policy on contraceptive devices further
marginalizes parents. Section 1018 states that &quot;all federally
funded programs which provide for the distribution of contraceptive
devices to unemancipated minors [shall] develop procedures to
encourage, <B>to the extent practical</B>, family participation
in such programs&quot; (emphasis added). How unlikely is it that
a school administrator will find it impractical to listen to parental
objections to a condom distribution policy?
<p>
<li>Midnight Basketball was originally a private sector plan.
There is no need for government to get involved in these charitable
efforts and regulate them to death.
</ul><p>
<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>
<p>
The Goals 2000 restructuring agenda will continue to spread like
kudzu throughout America as long as states receive Goals 2000
grants requiring them to submit their standards and assessments
for federal approval. Furthermore, zero-funding the Goals 2000
programs individually leaves open the possibility of future funding.
Complete repeal of Goals 2000 is the only solution.
<p>
Education reform calls for a reduction in the role of the federal
government in the system and a return to the traditional role
of school: teaching students basics like reading, writing, and
arithmetic. A decisive first step will be the repeal of Goals
2000, which subverts education reform with more federal regulation
and spending.

<H2>IS THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT<BR>
THROWING FIRST COURT<BR>
TEST OF MILITARY'S HOMOSEXUAL<BR>
LAW?</H2>

<CENTER>
<I>by</I>
<P>
<I>Lt. Col. Robert L. Maginnis (U.S.A., Ret.)</I></CENTER>
<P>
The Justice Department appears to be throwing a key military homosexual
case by not calling expert witnesses to rebut the half-truths
presented by pro-homosexual witnesses like former Assistant Secretary
of Defense Lawrence J. Korb.
<P>
Six avowed homosexuals are contesting the military's homosexual
law in a Brooklyn federal district court case, <I>Abel et al.
v. William Perry</I>.  This is the first federal case challenging
the military's new law.  Plaintiffs allege that the military ban
violates equal protection and free speech rights and imposes punitive
rules unrelated to fitness and ability to serve.[1]
<P>
Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund and the American Civil
Liberties Union are representing the homosexual servicemembers.
 They called six &quot;expert&quot; witnesses to refute the military's
constitutional right to exclude homosexuals.  Not one of those
witnesses was countered by expert defenders of the ban.[2]
<P>
The law is on solid constitutional ground.  Congress has the constitutional
responsibility for writing personnel laws for the military: Article
I, Section 8.  Congress conducted extensive hearings in both the
Senate and the House in 1993.  It then codified the military's
policy banning homosexuals, and President Clinton signed it into
law on November 30, 1993.  The law took effect on February 28,
1994.
<P>
Mr. Korb, who testified on March 16, is an apologist for homosexual
causes who now works for the Brookings Institute.  In the past,
he frequently has relied on a discredited study from the Defense
Personnel Security Research and Education Center (PERSEREC), which
contains much sloppy research and misinformation.
<P>
Some of Korb's statements on the topic deserve closer examination:
<P>
<LI><I>Army Times</I>, February 17, 1992.  Korb states: &quot; [PERSEREC]
 completed two 
studies that concluded: <I>Homosexuals are better prospective
military members than heterosexuals</I>; the Pentagon should engage
in empirical research to see if they can function appropriately
in military units; and the Pentagon should make judgments about
individuals based on conduct, not sexual orientation.&quot;
There is no evidence that &quot;homosexuals are better&quot; soldiers,
and the Pentagon's 1993 studies found conclusively that homosexuals
are a high-risk category of potential recruits. 
<P>
<LI><I>CNN</I>, &quot;Larry King Live,&quot; July 27, 1993.  Korb
said, &quot;[A]ccording to the Pentagon's own studies done out
in Monterey, <I>approximately 200,000 people in the military are
homosexuals.  So you're talking about 10 percent of the force</I>.&quot;
<P>
The cited &quot;studies&quot; relied on the discredited work of
sex researcher Alfred C. Kinsey.  They exaggerate Kinsey's already
overblown findings of sexual deviance in the general population,
including the now-refuted 10 percent myth for homosexuality. 
Even Planned Parenthood, <I>The New Republic</I> and <I>Newsweek</I>
concede as much.  More reliable surveys indicate that the homosexual
population in America is less than two percent.
<P>
<LI> Testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, March
31, 1993.  Korb testified, &quot;Professor Theodore Sarbin, co-author
of a 1991 PERSEREC study for the U.S. military, has stated that
<I>there is no data linking gays to lower morale or cohesion</I>.
 Rather he (Sarbin) noted that where there's good leadership,
there's high morale.&quot;
<P>
This statement is without foundation.  PERSEREC omits any reference
to any scientific study of military unit cohesion and discipline
and their effect on combat readiness.  
<P>
The Pentagon's 1993 task force that studied the issue of homosexuals
in the military found hundreds of cases where servicemembers discovered
to be homosexual were very disruptive.  Mr. Korb's anecdotal account
is disputed by these cases.
<P>
A survey by the American Security Council Foundation found that
99 percent of active duty officers said homosexuals would undermine
the cohesiveness and readiness of combat units.[3] The Defense Readiness
Council compiled a survey of 2,800 retired flag and general officers.
 Nearly 90 percent said they believe homosexuals undermine morale.[4]
<P>
<LI>Testimony in the 1994 case of <I>Margarethe Cammermeyer v. Les
Aspin</I>.  Korb told that court: &quot;The policy was never intended
to authorize the military to discharge someone simply based on
his or her status -- absent any evidence of conduct.  To the contrary,
conduct was the real focus of the policy....A servicemember's
own admission of being gay -- absent any indication of her propensity
to engage in homosexual conduct -- is simply not sufficient grounds
for discharging her under the existing policy....The policy I
authorized should not be construed as authorizing such an irrational
outcome.&quot;[5]
<P>
The military's pre-1993 ban was based on the principle that, &quot;Homosexuality is incompatible with military service.&quot;  Decades of court
rulings have affirmed the military's position that declaring oneself
a homosexual implies the person has or will engage in illegal
homosexual behavior.  
<P>
<LI>Testimony in the 1995 case of <I>Abel et al. v. William Perry</I>.
 Korb told the court, &quot;We were losing a lot of very good
people in whom the government had invested a lot of money.&quot;
 He also compared the homosexual exclusion with women in the military.
&quot;I can't over-emphasize the great opposition from military
leaders to ending the draft and bringing women into the services.&quot;
 Korb said he once shared a room with a homosexual without any
problem.
<P>
The military releases three times as many people each year for
drug abuse than it does for homosexuality.  And homosexuals in
the military have a bad record: as a group, they have a high ratio
of discipline problems and account for most of the AIDS cases.
<P>
Homosexual activists often try to compare their agenda with the
integration of blacks into the military.  Former chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff General Colin Powell does not agree:  &quot;Skin
color is a benign, nonbehavioral characteristic.  Sexual orientation
is perhaps the most profound of human behavioral characteristics.
 Comparison of the two is a convenient but invalid argument.&quot;[6]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CONCLUSION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The Justice Department and the Pentagon have many witnesses (active
duty and retired officers and civilians) who would refute the
half-truths presented by the pro-homosexual witnesses.  It is
inexplicable that in a politicized case like <I>Abel v. William
Perry,</I> the Justice Department failed to call experts to challenge
the misinformation promoted by homosexual groups.
<P>
The 104th Congress must demand that the Justice Department represent
the military's interests.  The evidence supports the military
homosexual law, but if the government is silent about the facts,
cases like this will be lost, and the destruction of military
morale will proceed unchecked.

SCUTTLES FIRST COURT TEST OF<BR>
MILITARY'S HOMOSEXUAL LAW</H2>

<P>
<CENTER><I>by</I>
<P>
<I>Lt. Col. Robert L. Maginnis (U.S.A., Ret.)</I></CENTER>
<P>
In a lackluster performance, the Clinton Administration failed
to use key arguments and called no witnesses in the first court
test of the military's new homosexual law.  
<P>
On March 30, 1995, Judge Eugene Nickerson of the Eastern District
of New York struck down parts of the military's new homosexual
law and the Pentagon's implementing directives in the case of
<I>Lieutenant Colonel Jane Able, et al. v. United States of America</I>.[1]
<P>
Judge Nickerson ruled that six service members' First and Fifth
Amendment rights were violated when the military sought to discharge
them solely based on their admissions of homosexuality.  He enjoined
the Pentagon from discharging the six, and the Justice Department
is expected to appeal the case to the Second Circuit Court of
Appeals.
<P>
This case follows a pattern seen in the Steffan, Meinhold, and
Cammermeyer cases whereby the government ignores key arguments
for prohibiting service by avowed homosexuals.  These cases demonstrate
fundamental differences between the law, which was signed by President
Clinton on November 30, 1993, and the Pentagon's implementing
directions, which took effect February 28, 1994.
<P>
Specifically, the Justice Department failed to:
<P><UL>
<LI>Call witnesses to represent the government's interest.  The
plaintiffs called six &quot;expert&quot; witnesses to dispute
long-held &quot;myths&quot; about homosexuals. 
<P>
<LI>Present well documented arguments for denying homosexual service
based on physical and psychological problems.
<P>
<LI>Demonstrate that the policy is conduct-based rather than status-based
as the plaintiffs argued.
<P>
<LI>Show that homosexual &quot;lifestyles&quot; and &quot;values&quot;
are contrary to the best interests of the armed services and present
serious morale and unit cohesion problems.
<P>
<LI>Refute a flawed study cited by the plaintiffs as evidence that
homosexuals will not damage morale and unit cohesion.
<P>
<LI>Demonstrate that homosexuals present a risk to the military
and therefore the military's ban is justified.  
</UL>
The judge noted key differences between the law and the directives:
<P><UL>
<LI>Although the law permits asking about homosexual acts and orientation
at the point of admission, the Clinton Administration has rejected
the questions.  The judge labeled this as unusual.  On one hand
the Pentagon encourages homosexuals to join (by not making homosexuality
part of a pre-induction litmus test) and then insists that the
homosexual remain secretive about his &quot;status.&quot;
<P>
<LI>The law denies service to homosexuals, but the directives permit
service to admitted homosexuals who can rebut the presumption
that they will engage in homosexual misconduct.  This creates
a status/conduct dichotomy.  The judge labels the rebuttable presumption
as &quot;Orwellian.&quot;
</UL>
<CENTER><H3>FIRST AMENDMENT ARGUMENT</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The plaintiffs complain that the government violated their First
Amendment rights when it tried to discharge them for stating that
they are homosexual.  
<P>
The military law [10 U.S.C. 654(b)(2)] permits discharge when
&quot;the member has stated that he or she is a homosexual or
bisexual, or words to that effect, unless there is a further finding,
made and approved in accordance with procedures set forth in the
regulations, that the member has demonstrated that he or she is
not a person who engages in, attempts to engage in, has a propensity
to engage in, or intends to engage in homosexual acts.&quot; 
The Pentagon's directives which implement this law [DoD Directive
1332.14 and 1332.30] have the same litmus test.
<P>
The government argued that this is not a First Amendment issue
because the law and the directives are directed solely at the
prohibition of acts and give members the opportunity to rebut
the presumption of misconduct.  However, the government failed
to show a nexus between a declaration of homosexuality and homosexual
misconduct.  In fact, government lawyers labeled much of the available
evidence as &quot;myths,&quot; thus aiding the plaintiffs.  
<P>
<CENTER><H3> GOVERNMENT FAILED TO EXPLAIN RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH HOMOSEXUALS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The judge noted that the government made no argument to exclude
homosexuals based on &quot;mental illness,&quot; security or infectious
diseases.  In fact, Justice Department lawyers dismissed these
well-founded arguments as &quot;myths.&quot;  Consider the facts.
<P>
<B>Homosexuals as a category present unacceptable risks.</B>
Research shows that homosexuals tend to be extremely promiscuous
and tend to have high incidences of sexually transmitted diseases,
especially the deadly AIDS virus.
<P>
Admitting homosexuals into the military violates the legal principle
of the assumption of risk.  This principle states that if you
know there is a risk and you assume it, then don't complain when
the risk materializes.  
<P>
A recent study from the University of Michigan found that people
with HIV are more capable of spreading the virus during the first
60 days of infection but that blood tests during this period do
not find the HIV antibodies.[2] This means that the military assumes
some risk, even though all personnel are initially tested, that
soldiers are not infected.  This is why screening out high-risk
groups and not just those who test positive for HIV is appropriate.
 Unfortunately, the Clinton Administration no longer screens out
homosexuals -- by far the highest risk group for contracting HIV.
<P>
The Army's Surgeon General, Lieutenant General Alcide Lanoue,
has addressed the health risks associated with homosexuals:[3]
<P><UL>
<LI>&quot;The military setting provides unique requirements for
safety in executing the Army blood transfusion program and for
preventing the transmission of blood-borne pathogens (especially
HIV and hepatitis B) in the field setting.  Homosexual males would
comprise a pool of ineligible blood donors and as a group are
at high risk of infection by HIV and hepatitis B, both significant
blood-borne pathogens which can infect other soldiers through
exposure to blood in peace and war.&quot; [During Operation Desert
Storm, there were five documented instances where blood was drawn
directly from soldiers and transfused.  In Somalia, five units
of blood were drawn from soldiers and directly transfused to Somalis.
 The urgency of such transfusions precludes testing for the AIDS
virus.]
<P>
<LI>&quot;HIV and other Sexually Transmitted Disease rates will
increase to the extent that the proportion of homosexual males
in the Army increases because homosexual/bisexual men are allowed
to enter and remain in the Army.&quot; [The CDC reports that most
of the AIDS patients in this country are homosexuals.[4] Homosexuals
account for a disproportionate number of America's most serious
STD's, including syphilis, gonorrhea, genital warts, and hepatitis
A and B.[5] Moreover, the 1994 homosexual sex survey in <I>The Advocate</I>,
a mainstream homosexual magazine, found that 13 percent of respondents
were HIV-positive and only 18 percent had taken all three shots
in the hepatitis B vaccine series.  <I>The Advocate</I> article
admits that, &quot;Gay men are one of the top risk groups for
being exposed to hepatitis B.[6]
<P>
<LI> &quot;A male homosexual soldier is significantly more likely
than a heterosexual soldier to be nondeployable for medical reasons
related to HIV infection.  If HIV-infected, the soldier will be
permanently nondeployable.  Male homosexuals are more likely to
acquire sexually transmitted diseases which can render them nondeployable,
such as gonorrhea, syphilis, and hepatitis B.
</UL>
&quot;Readiness from a medical standpoint will suffer if the restriction
is lifted.  The impact would be felt at the unit level, when the
homosexual soldier cannot train and deploy for health reasons.
 Likewise, the impact would be felt Army-wide in terms of the
military blood program and of the burden placed on the Army health
care system.&quot;
<P>
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, homosexuals
are especially vulnerable to contracting HIV.  They are a high-risk
group because of co-factors associated with their lifestyle. 
These include recreational drug use, homosexual sex, malnutrition,
prior incidents of sexually transmitted diseases, and, most significantly,
sexual promiscuity.  
<P>
Homosexuals who participate in unsafe sex practices with multiple
partners and without taking precautions are at great risk of contracting
sexually transmitted diseases.  <I>The Advocate</I> survey found
that 72 percent of homosexual respondents engage in insertive
oral intercourse, 46 percent insertive anal intercourse, 45 percent
receptive anal-oral sex, 48 percent in three-way sex, 24 percent
in group sex (4 or more), and 10 percent in sadomasochism.[7] Most
of the homosexuals in the survey admitted to having had more than
30 sex partners over their lifetime, and more than a third (35%)
report more than 100 partners.  The survey also found that only
one time in four do homosexual men use condoms.[8]
<P>
Heterosexuals have fewer sex partners than homosexuals.  A 1988-1990
General Social Survey found that 91 percent of men 25 to 29 years
of age are heterosexually active.  Nineteen percent of these men
have had only one sex partner, 55 percent have had two to 19 partners,
and 25 percent have had 20 or more partners.[9]
<P>
The University of Chicago published a national sex survey in October,
1994, which found that 20 percent of men have had only one sex
partner in their lifetime, 21 percent have had two to four partners,
17 percent 5 to 10 partners, 16 percent 11 to 20 and 17 percent
report having had 21 or more sex partners.[10] However, that survey
excluded men over 59, who constitute one-sixth of the population
and who typically have had more conservative sex lives.  Thus
the real figures probably are even lower for the population of
all men.[11]
<P>
Homosexuality also increases medical costs.  With the ban in place,
openly homosexual inductees are turned away.  However, with the
ban lifted, a homosexual recruit could contract HIV within days
of induction or have early-stage HIV and not test positive and
be accorded full medical benefits for the rest of his life.  This
is about $120,000 in direct medical costs per AIDS patient.[12]
<P>
Dr. Edmund Tramont, Associate Director for retroviral research
at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, published a 10-year projection
for HIV costs at $1.7 to $1.9 billion.[13] He warns that this is
in 1989 dollars, is based on the present rate of new cases and
assumes that only 60 percent of health care beneficiaries will
use the military health care system.  The potential 10-year cost
could rise to $5 billion if these assumptions are incorrect.[14]
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services indicates that
the lifetime cost of treating a person with AIDS -- from diagnosis
until death -- is $102,000.[15] The American Medical Association
estimated the per-person AIDS patient cost would rise to $386,000
by the year 2000 and $639,000 by the year 2008.[16]
<P>
As of April 1993 the military had dealt with 8,832 HIV-positive
service members.  Most have been separated, but at that time 1,580
were still on active duty.  Their status precluded them from deploying
overseas and necessitated special assignments and special medical
care.[17]
<P>
Homosexuals also have much shorter life expectancy than heterosexuals
as indicated by a study of more than 6,737 obituaries published
in <I>Omega: Journal of Death and Dying</I>.  The average age
of homosexuals who died from AIDS is 39; from all other causes
it is 42.[18]
<P>
Substance addiction and abuse represent the second key health
problems after AIDS in the homosexual subculture (with violence
the third).[19] A report by the National Lesbian-Gay Health Foundation
found that homosexuals -- men and women -- are about three times
as likely as heterosexuals to have an alcohol or drug abuse problem.[20]
<P>
While the 1992 GAO report states that the military spent $26 million
on homosexuals discharged,  it spent many times that figure treating
homosexuals with AIDS -- people who lied to enter the military
and now receive full health and pay benefits.  The cost-effective
decision would be to minimize the risk to the federal taxpayer
by rejecting homosexuals before they are recruited and discharging
those later discovered.
<P>
The 1992 GAO report also found that women are discharged for homosexuality
four times as often as men.  They are much more likely to be processed
under administrative discharge procedures than men.
<P>
Lesbians are also disruptive to unit morale and cohesion.  Pentagon
records include vignettes[21] such as the case of a female sergeant
who drank too much.  She approached four different women at a
base social club making sexually explicit remarks and grabbing
one woman's buttocks.  She was arrested on charges of indecent
assault.
<P>
A female veteran told her account of another female soldier who
made sexual advances in a barracks.  &quot;I was stuck in the
same barracks with that person for three months.  I had to get
up and look at that person every day.  She [the homosexual] insisted
on trying to find a mate in the barracks, and by the end of the
training, everyone has [sic] lost morale.&quot;
<P>
A female basic training soldier complained to her drill sergeant
that other female trainees were &quot;making out&quot; in a common
area.  The sergeant subsequently found seven female soldiers partially
dressed, embracing each other, holding hands, and kissing.  The
seven admitted they were lesbians and said that they were consenting
adults.  They stated they had not engaged in sexual activities,
and their lifestyle had nothing to do with being a good soldier.
<P>
A female air force veteran was assigned a lesbian roommate.  She
made strong sexual advances to the straight airwoman, so much
so that the airwoman left her room and slept on the floor in a
friend's barracks.
<P>
<B>The Justice Department ignored evidence showing that homosexuality
is a pathology.</B>  
<P>
Rather, contrary to long-established military precedence, the
government embraced the concept that homosexuality is normal or
at least of little consequence.  Labeling homosexuality as other
than a pathology is a serious mistake.
<P>
The military's World War II experience provided considerable insight
into human behavior.  Specialists in military medicine literally
rewrote the diagnostic codes and nomenclature for psychiatric
disorders.  Since 1945, the Army has consistently held that homosexuality
is a behavioral problem, not a mental disease.[22]
<P>
In 1952, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) Council approved
and published a new nomenclature for categorizing mental disorders
similar to those used by the military.[23] In the more than 40 years
since that time, the APA, under pressure from militant homosexual
groups, has progressively changed the nomenclature so as to remove
the negative connotations implicit in the terms &quot;sexual deviation&quot;
or &quot;pathology.&quot;
<P>
During its annual meetings from 1969 through 1971, the APA was
besieged by activists demanding the recognition of homosexual
behavior as normal.  In 1971, homosexual activists invaded the
annual meeting and denounced psychiatry as &quot;the enemy incarnate.&quot;[24]
<P>
In 1973, activists challenged the New England Psychiatric Society
to rename the section on &quot;sexual deviation&quot; to &quot;sexual
dysfunction.&quot;  Later that year, APA trustees ruled that homosexuality
would no longer be listed in its official nomenclature of mental
disorders but, rather, would be referred to as &quot;sexual orientation
disturbance.&quot;[25]
<P>
The revision of nomenclature continued when, in 1986, the last
remaining term, &quot;ego-dystonic homosexuality,&quot; was removed
from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Psychiatric Disorders.
 This was done over the strong protest of many psychiatrists who
preferred to label homosexuality a long standing disturbance originating
in the early years of life.[26]
<P>
A survey of the American Medical Association membership in 1975
found that 69 percent agreed that homosexuality is &quot;pathological.&quot;[27]
 An argument used by those who promote homosexuality is that this
proclivity is inborn and irreversible.  Numerous psychotherapists,
including Elizabeth Moberly, Gerald van den Aardweg, Joseph Nicolosi,
Charles Socarides, and Masters and Johnson have reported significant
success in helping homosexuals to recover, thereby proving it
is a curable pathology.[28]
<P>
Despite considerable evidence of success in gender reparative
therapy, the APA, under pressure from gay activists, voted to
stop recommending efforts to turn unhappy homosexuals into heterosexuals.
 In December 1994, AMA's governing House of Delegates called for
a &quot;nonjudgmental recognition of sexual orientation by physicians.&quot;[29]
<P>
<B>The government ignored evidence that homosexuals are a security
risk by relying on a debunked government report which suggests
that homosexuals are no more at risk of blackmail than heterosexuals.</B>
<P>
The primary study comes from the Defense Personnel Security Research
and Education Center (PERSEREC), an agency of the Department of
Defense.[30] Although the report contains much sloppy research and
misinformation, it is frequently cited by one of the plaintiffs'
key witnesses in this case, former Assistant Secretary of Defense
Lawrence J. Korb.
<P>
Few people identify themselves as heterosexual; that identity
is assumed.  Homosexuals do, indeed, identify themselves, however.
<P>
Landmark research by Alan Bell and Martin Weinberg, <I>Homosexualities:
A Study of Diversity Among Men and Women</I>, found that a significant
number of homosexuals report that &quot;someone has threatened
[them with] exposure of homosexuality in order to get something
of value.&quot;[31]
<P>
If the threat of blackmail were the only problem with homosexuals
in the military, then lifting the prohibition might be justified.
 However, homosexuals should not serve for many reasons, and security
investigations are a valid mechanism for enforcing the law.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>JUDGE SEES A STATUS V. CONDUCT DICHOTOMY</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The legal fiction that an admission of homosexuality is not a
valid presumption of misconduct has long been dismissed by the
courts.  For many years, the military has won homosexual cases
because the courts recognize that people don't label themselves
homosexuals without some experience or intent to engage in the
defining behavior.  The Clinton Administration tried to finesse
this point in court but failed to persuade the judge, who labeled
the government's arguments as &quot;Orwellian.&quot;
<P>
Because the government failed to show a connection between a declaration
of homosexuality and misconduct, the judge understandably concluded
&quot;that the admission of homosexuals did not pose an uncontrollable
risk that they would commit acts inherently dangerous to morale,
good order, and discipline....&quot;
<P>
<CENTER><H3>JUDGE RELIES ON DEBUNKED STUDY</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The government argued that homosexuals create sexual tension in
single-gender organizations.  This tension undermines morale and
cohesion which are key to military readiness.
<P>
The plaintiffs dismiss this argument by citing a Rand Corporation
study which concludes &quot;although some disruptions might result
from having acknowledged homosexuals serving in the military....the
experience of analogous [non-military] organizations...suggests
that any increase is likely to be quite small.&quot;
<P>
In 1993, Secretary of Defense Les Aspin commissioned the Rand
Corporation to study lifting the military's homosexual ban.  The
Rand study cost $1.3 million and contains inaccurate or misleading
information and inappropriate parallels.
<P><UL>
<LI>Judge Nickerson cites Rand's report on other countries, &quot;[N]o
serious problems were reported concerning the presence of homosexuals
in the force.&quot;
<P>
Rand ignored the June 1993 GAO report on &quot;Homosexuals in
the Military: Policies and Practices of Foreign Countries.&quot;[32]
 The GAO reviewed 25 countries and selected four countries for
detailed analysis.  The report states that 11 countries have policies
that do not permit homosexuals to serve in the military, 11 have
policies that do.  Three of the latter 11 countries do not have
any laws, regulations, or policies that address this issue.  An
unpublished Pentagon study conducted in December 1992 found that
some of those countries that permit homosexuals to serve do so
with strict limitations. 
<P>
Testimony before the Senate and House Armed Services Committees
(SASC and HASC) in April and May 1993 illustrates the dramatic
differences between foreign militaries and our own.  For example,
the Netherlands started a homosexual military experiment in 1974.
 That nation has 65,000 service members, including 40,000 conscripts
who serve 14 months and who primarily commute from home each day.
 The U.S. has 2.5 million active and reserve service personnel
stationed in the U.S. and around the world at any given time.
 The U.S. routinely participates in combat operations, something
the Dutch have not done for 50 years.      
The German armed forces, which are included among those that do
<I>not</I> have an exclusionary policy, will not induct acknowledged
homosexual volunteers because they would &quot;undermine military
order and discipline.&quot;[33] Of the 476,300 members, 43 percent
are conscripts who, if identified as homosexual, may be required
to undergo psychological tests to determine their fitness.  The
German Federal Administrative Court declared in November 1990
that the military is justified in not allowing homosexuals to
serve in leadership and educational positions.
<P>
Foreign social experiences have little relevance for America's
military.  The U.S. is a superpower with urgent missions worldwide.
 America also has a radical homosexual community and a liberal
judicial system, a combination that guarantees a steady stream
of legal activism that is disruptive to military morale.
<P>
<LI>Judge Nickerson cites the 1992 GAO study on analogous organizations
which &quot;accepted homosexuals into their ranks...[and] have
generally not reported adverse impacts.&quot;
<P>
Rand's &quot;analogous organizations&quot; are fire and police
departments.  Researchers visited six cities and concluded that
homosexuals were integrated through clear and simple policies,
aggressive leadership and adherence to strict standards of conduct.
 The report prescribes the same approach for the military.
<P>
Rand ignores the important lessons from San Francisco Chief of
Police Anthony D. Ribera, who told the HASC on May 7, 1993 that
his department experiences a &quot;significantly higher&quot;
number of AIDS deaths among homosexual officers.  His department
routinely tests for Hepatitis B -- as demanded by the policemen's
union.  And they rely on local hospitals rather than other officers
for emergency blood.
<P>
San Francisco's officers also go home evenings or, as in the Seattle
Fire Department, occupy private cubicles when required to stay
overnight.  Additionally, homosexual officers serve primarily
in homosexual districts and, as in New York City, no one is forced
to pair up with a homosexual.  Chief Ribera concludes, &quot;Our
experience is remotely parallel to the military.&quot;
<P>
Sgt. Edward Striedinger of the Seattle Police Department told
the HASC about female officers who complained about advances from
lesbian officers.  These women refused to file formal complaints,
citing fear of reprisals. 
<P>
The parallels between paramilitary and military organizations
are mostly cosmetic, such as wearing side-arms and uniforms. 
The differences are pronounced but ignored in Rand's briefing.
<P>
<LI>Judge Nickerson cites Rand's study on racial integration of
the services stating, integration &quot;did not 'destroy' unit
cohesion and military effectiveness.&quot;
<P>
Rand equates the evolving &quot;discriminatory&quot; homosexual
policy with the integration of blacks into the military.  General
Colin Powell has rejected the linkage: &quot;Skin color is [a]
benign, nonbehavioral characteristic.  Sexual orientation is perhaps
the most profound of human behavioral characteristics.  Comparison
of the two is a convenient but invalid argument.&quot;[34]
<P>
The Council of 100 (a national organization of African-American
Republicans founded in 1974) points out differences in the moral
and social climate in 1948 (when President Truman directed the
military to integrate), and the fact that blacks had honorably
and openly served since the Revolutionary War.  The Council said
that the homosexual discrimination argument is &quot;a disingenuous
strategy to divert attention from the real issues&quot; of readiness
and cohesion.[35]
<P>
The integration of avowed homosexuals brings into the military
services individuals whose behavior violates federal law.  The
integration of black Americans involved no behavioral assumptions.
</UL>
<CENTER><H3>FIFTH AMENDMENT ARGUMENT</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The government argued that heterosexual service members &quot;will
be upset by a co-worker's mere statement of homosexuality&quot;
and as a result refuse to work cooperatively.  The judge labels
this unjustified discrimination.
<P>
The government once again failed to present compelling evidence
that homosexual &quot;lifestyles&quot; and &quot;values&quot;
are incompatible with military service.
<P>
Consider the implications of homosexual service for military morale.
<P>
Morale means &quot;a strong sense of enthusiasm and dedication
to a commonly shared goal that unifies a group.&quot;  Heterosexual
soldiers forced to live and work with avowed homosexuals cannot
be expected to submit to sexual tension with &quot;...a strong
sense of enthusiasm.&quot;  
<P>
Open homosexuals tend to derive their basic identity from their
sexual orientation and practice: &quot;I am a homosexual,&quot;
as opposed to the American soldier's basic identity: &quot;I am
a soldier.&quot;  The homosexual's preoccupation with individual
behavioral characteristics is incongruent with and detracts from
the commonly shared goal -- accomplishment of the mission -- which
unifies heterosexual soldiers and subordinates their individual
goals to that of the group.
<P>
The homosexual subculture is recognized as &quot;liberated,&quot;
or in a manner of speaking, undisciplined.  This is inherently
at odds with the 24-hour discipline system within which soldiers
must live and work.  Homosexuals are distinguished from other
subcultures by their behavior [sodomy].  One group behavioral
characteristic is a very high rate of promiscuity.  Military records
indicate that homosexuals are statistically more likely to engage
in misconduct than heterosexuals.  They have a higher incidence
of drug and alcohol abuse than heterosexuals.  If these aren't
enough, much-touted books such as Randy Shilts' <I>Conduct Unbecoming</I>
and Mary Ann Humphrey's <I>My Country, My Right to Serve</I> provide,
perhaps unwittingly, ample testimony to the disruptive nature
of homosexuals in military units.[36]
<P>
The voice of experience indicates that homosexuals jeopardize
military morale.  For example, a survey of active duty officers
conducted for the American Security Council Foundation found that
99.03 percent said homosexuals would undermine the cohesiveness
and readiness of combat units.[37] The Defense Readiness Council
compiled a survey of 2,800 retired flag and general officers.
 Nearly 90 percent said they believe homosexuals undermine morale.[38]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>JUDGE MAKES NO MORAL DECISION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Judge Nickerson explained that his task &quot;is to determine
the constitutionality of the policy adopted by Congress, not its
morality.&quot;  He argues that everyone is &quot;entitled to
think it demeaning and unworthy of a great nation to base a policy
on pretense rather than on truth.&quot;
<P>
The judge suggests that constitutionality and morality may not
agree in this case, but many soldiers think this is clearly a
morality issue.  And requiring soldiers to &quot;tolerate&quot;
homosexuality will lead to recruitment and retention problems.
 The <I>Los Angeles Times</I> survey found that 46 percent of
soldiers said lifting the ban would enter into their reenlistment
decision and 11 percent would not reenlist because of it.  A February
1993 <I>CNN/Gallup Poll</I> found that, among men who had not
attended college, the prime recruiting population, 74 percent
opposed lifting the ban.  
<P>
The judge's labeling this a &quot;pretense&quot; is based on the
Clinton Administration's decision to stop asking recruits whether
they are homosexual.  Asking the question keeps honest homosexuals
out and sends a clear message that to serve, others must keep
their homosexuality a secret.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CONCLUSION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
It is expected that the Supreme Court will hear this case by 1997.
 As long as the government permits homosexuals to serve and as
long as the Clinton Administration's implementing directives flout
the law, however, the outcome is in doubt.
<P>
The 104th Congress must take legislative action to stop the evasion
of reality.  The Clinton Administration should be required to
abide by the law and the Justice Department must defend the law
using longstanding and successful arguments.

<TITLE>ACCREDITATION COUNCIL MANDATES ABORTION TRAINING </TITLE>

<H2>ACCREDITATION COUNCIL<BR>
MANDATES ABORTION TRAINING</H2>
</CENTER>

<P>
On February 14, 1995, the 23-member Accreditation Council for
Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) voted unanimously to pass new
regulations mandating that all medical residents specializing
in obstetrics and gynecology be trained to perform elective abortions.
 Individual residents expressing moral or religious objections
would be able to opt out of the abortion training.  However, medical
institutions opposed to abortion, such as Catholic hospitals,
would still be required -- in order to maintain their accredited
status -- to provide their students with abortion training by
arranging for their students to receive such training at another
location.
<P>
The wording of the new requirement is as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;Experience with induced abortion must be part of residency
education, except for residents with moral or religious objections.
 This education can be provided outside the institution.  Experience
with management of complications of abortion must be provided
to all residents.  If a residency program has a religious, moral
or legal restriction which prohibits the residents from performing
abortions within the institution, the program must ensure that
the residents receive a satisfactory education and experience
managing the complications of abortion.  Furthermore, such residency
programs must have mechanisms which ensure that residents in their
program who do not have a religious or moral objection receive
education and experience in performing abortion at another institution.&quot;[1]
<P></BLOCKQUOTE>
Programs which fail to comply with the new regulations risk losing
their accreditation.  Accreditation status qualifies teaching
hospitals to receive federal reimbursement for services which
medical residents provide to patients.  Moreover, doctors must
ordinarily graduate from accredited training programs to get certified
as competent in their specialties.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>DECLINE IN ABORTION PROVIDERS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Over the last twenty years, the number of medical schools offering
elective abortion training to their residents has declined.  In
1976, 92.5 percent of U.S. 
medical schools offered first-trimester abortion training, either
on a routine (26.3 percent) or optional basis (66.2 percent).
 This contrasts with 1991 figures in which 68.8 percent of medical
schools offered first-trimester abortion training -- 12.4 percent
on a routine basis, 56.4 percent on an optional basis.[2] Second-trimester
abortion training is only slightly less common than first-trimester
training programs (65.4 percent vs. 68.8 percent respectively),
but fewer medical schools routinely offer second-trimester abortion
training (6.7 percent); more provide optional training (58.7 percent).[3]
<P>
About one third of medical schools refuse to provide abortion
training due to moral and/or legal reasons.  For example, Catholic-affiliated
hospitals -- which make up about 20 percent of all U.S. hospitals
-- do not perform elective abortions because of religious and
moral beliefs.[4] Other hospitals, such as the publicly financed
Truman Medical Center in Missouri, are legally prohibited from
performing abortions because laws in several states -- including
Missouri -- bar the use of taxpayer money to fund abortions.[5]
<P>
In addition to the declining number of medical schools which provide
abortion training, fewer physicians are willing to perform abortions.
 A Columbia University survey found that nearly half of the ob/gyn
chief residents graduating each year have never performed a first-trimester
abortion.[6]
<P>
Overall, the Alan Guttmacher Institute (AGI) reports that the
number of hospitals, clinics, and physicians' offices that provide
abortions -- 2,380 in 1992 -- has been declining at a rate of
about 65 a year.  Most of the decline can be attributed to hospitals;
the number of hospitals providing abortions decreased by 18 percent
between 1988 and 1992.[7]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>ENSURING THAT WOMEN HAVE A CHOICE?</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Proponents of ACGME's new regulations such as the National Abortion
Federation, the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, the
Feminist Majority Foundation, the Center for Reproductive Law
and Policy, and the current leadership of the American College
of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) point to the decline
in abortion providers as justification for the mandate.  They
emphasize that unless the procedure is required, many ob/gyn students
will choose to opt out of abortion training, thereby decreasing
access to abortion.
<P>
Abortion advocacy groups hope the ACGME mandate will help bring
abortion back into the &quot;mainstream&quot; of ob/gyn practice.
 Currently, the vast majority of abortions are performed in clinics,
isolating abortion from the general practice of medicine.  Abortionists
also say they frequently feel less respected by their colleagues
and society in general.  By including abortion as a necessary
ob/gyn service, abortion proponents hope to remove the taint associated
with abortion and also reduce the targeting of clinics by abortion
protesters.
<P>
Finally, the ACGME cited patient safety as a reason to require
abortion training.  Dr. John C. Gienapp, Ph.D., executive director
of ACGME, said, &quot;Those physicians who choose to develop appropriate
medical skills in the area of abortion must be trained adequately.&quot;[8]
 The American Medical Association agreed, saying in a statement,
&quot;For the safety of patients, it is essential that physicians
providing abortion services are trained and competent.&quot;[9]
<P>
While the new regulations will not go into effect until January
1, 1996, abortion advocacy groups as well as several medical societies
-- including ACOG -- have lobbied the ACGME for over a year to
adopt such a policy change.[10]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>OR REMOVING CHOICE FROM OB/GYN PHYSICIANS?</H3></CENTER>
<P>
ACGME's new abortion mandate has received considerable opposition
-- from pro-life groups to many within the medical establishment.
 &quot;Pro-choice&quot; physician James Schreiber, M.D., chief
of obstetrics and gynecology at Washington University Medical
Center in St. Louis, denounced the new policy as coercive and
&quot;anti-choice,&quot; saying that institutions with moral objections
were &quot;being forced into an untenable position.&quot;[11]
<P>
Richard T. F. Schmidt, M.D., a former ACOG president (1977-1978)
and residency review committee member, also questions the rationale
behind the abortion training mandate.  In a letter to ACGME's
ob/gyn residency review committee, Dr. Schmidt wrote, &quot;Is
there a demonstrated lack of knowledge or technical competence
among program graduates?  Or is the purpose to make more residents
comfortable with the <I>idea</I> of elective abortion and its
performance?&quot;  Commenting on the diminishing number of programs
offering elective abortion training, Dr. Schmidt said that given
a choice, faculty and residents &quot;voted very clearly with
their feet.&quot;[12]
<P>
The Christian Medical and Dental Society (CMDS), the American
Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the National
Conference of Catholic Bishops, and other pro-life and pro-family
groups have also registered their strong opposition to the new
mandate.  These groups argue that requiring residents to undergo
abortion training will have the effect of dissuading many pro-life
medical students from choosing to specialize in ob/gyn.  These
groups also believe that residents will receive intense pressure
from within the medical school to undergo abortion training due
to the accreditation requirement.[13]
<P>
The fears these groups express may well be justified.  An editorial
published in the <I>New England Journal of Medicine</I> indicates
that ob/gyn residents will receive considerable pressure to undergo
elective abortion training.  The author of the editorial, an advocate
of the new ACGME requirements, writes that &quot;[r]esidents who
wish to opt out of abortion training should be required to explain
why in a way that satisfies <I>stringent</I> and <I>explicit</I>
criteria&quot; (emphasis added).[14]  Furthermore, two years ago the
University of North Carolina School of Medicine in Chapel Hill
found that greater numbers of residents were refusing to perform
abortions even though the school provided training.  As a result,
the school sent a letter to all prospective residents in the summer
of 1993 saying that it would accept only candidates who agreed
to perform abortions.  The policy was rescinded after threats
of a class-action lawsuit.[15]
<P>
The North Carolina scenario demonstrates that ACGME's new policies
were not passed in response to ob/gyn residents who wanted to
receive abortion training but were unable to receive it.  Such
a conclusion is also supported by a recently released survey by
the American Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, a
recognized special interest group within the American College
of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG).  With almost 25 percent
of the 36,000 ACOG members responding, the survey found that 59
percent of respondents felt that abortion training should <U>not</U>
be required in residency programs.[16]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>IMPACTS OF THE ABORTION TRAINING MANDATE</H3></CENTER>
<P>
ACGME's new requirements seem to be implicitly directed at teaching
residents to perform second- and third-trimester abortions.  As
Congressman and family physician/obstetrician Tom Coburn (R-OK)
has testified, medical residents already receive training in handling
spontaneous abortions (miscarriages) through dilation and curettage
(D &amp; C), which is the usual technique used for first-trimester
abortions.  Only later-term abortions require additional training
in special techniques to &quot;terminate the pregnancy.&quot;[17]
<P>
The new policy would also require teaching hospitals to provide
or obtain additional facilities, equipment, and faculty (or contract
with other institutions to do so).  Furthermore, hospitals which
have not historically referred patients for abortions because
of moral reasons and which refuse to provide abortion training
on-site would nonetheless be forced to violate their fundamental
beliefs and directly collaborate with abortion providers.  The
mandate also violates laws in roughly half the states that exempt
hospitals from referring for abortion, contraception, or sterilization
when the hospital is conscientiously opposed.
<P>
Because the abortion training mandate does conflict with several
states' laws, it can also be reasonably expected that Planned
Parenthood and other abortion providers will file lawsuits to
change the laws which (1) exempt hospitals from referring for
abortion, and (2) explicitly ban the use of taxpayer monies to
fund abortions in publicly-funded hospitals.

<P>
The forced feminization of the Navy is undermining combat readiness
and Congress must exercise its Constitutional responsibility to
examine these politically motivated changes before more damage
is done.
<P>
Defense Secretary William Perry promised, &quot;Our over-arching
goal is to maintain a high-quality, ready and effective force.
 By increasing the numbers of units and positions to which women
can be assigned, the military services gain greater flexibility
in the development and use of human resources.&quot;[1] 
<P>
Unfortunately, Mr. Perry has set a course to feminize the Navy
without regard for military necessity.  Today, 94 percent of Navy
billets, including previously exempt combat positions, are open
to women.  Secretary Perry promotes these changes as &quot;equal
opportunity.&quot;[2]
<P>
Consider factors that seriously impair Navy readiness.
<P><UL>
<LI>A Navy study found that women are NOT physically equipped to
perform most at-sea emergency tasks.
<P>
<LI>A 1995 Navy policy embraces pregnancy as an acceptable readiness
problem in spite of the fact that almost half of pregnant sailors
never return to their crews after delivery.
<P>
<LI>Fraternization is a growing problem among crew members aboard
mixed-gender ships and this contributes to serious morale and
cohesion problems at sea.  It also has a negative effect on the
well-being of military spouses back home.
<P>
<LI>The Navy has ignored longstanding screening standards in order
to accelerate less qualified women into positions, thus bypassing
more experienced men.
<P>
<LI>Sexual harassment charges are a favorite tool of some women
who manipulate Navy leaders to promote personal agendas.
<P>
<LI>The Defense Department has promised to raise the percentage
of female servicemembers to perhaps 25 percent of the total force.[3]
</UL>
<CENTER><H3>STUDY SAYS WOMEN ARE DIFFERENT</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The Navy has ignored key findings which demonstrate that women
are less equipped physically to perform assignments aboard combat ships.
 The Navy Personnel Research and Development Center in San Diego,
California, conducted a comprehensive study of 350 men and 195
women to determine what effect training had on their physical
performances.  The study measured performance on five basic damage
control tasks: carrying litters on level surfaces and up and down
ladders, moving and starting emergency pumps, turning engine bolts,
and directing fire hose streams.  Virtually all male recruits
were able to perform all of the tasks before training, while women
could perform only one of the tasks to a satisfactory standard.[4]
<P>
Even after significant training, women showed no appreciable improvement.
 The study found that the differences between the sexes on measures
of lifting strength and aerobic capacity are dramatic.  
<P>
All naval crewmembers must be prepared to perform damage control
assignments.  Lack of physical strength among female sailors can
decrease survivability.  For example, had more women been aboard
the <I>USS Stark</I>, crippled by an Iraqi missile in the Persian
Gulf, the loss of life and property would very likely have been
greater.
<P>
Analogous organization experiences show similar trends.  Civilian
fire departments have reported disproportionate differences between
the sexes in injury rates when women are expected to perform like
men.  They suffer up to three times as many disabling back injuries
as men.[5] Women suffer more injuries because to lift the same load
as men, they must operate near their maximum lifting capacity,
e.g., a male medic carrying a litter uses on the average half
of his lifting power, but a woman uses on average her full lifting
capacity.
<P>
The 1992 Presidential Commission on the Assignment of Women in
the Armed Forces found that women's aerobic capacity is significantly
lower, meaning they cannot carry as much as far as fast as men.
 Despite the existence of an exceedingly small number of Amazonian
women who resemble men in muscular mass, on average, women are
shorter, have less muscle mass and weigh less than men.  This
puts them at a distinct disadvantage when performing tasks requiring
a high level of muscular strength and aerobic capacity.[6]
<P>
The Commission also found that women are at a higher risk for
exercise-induced injuries than men, with 2.13 times greater risk
for lower extremity injuries, and 4.71 times greater risk for
stress fractures.[7]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>PREGNANCY POLICY HURTS READINESS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The Navy's 1995 pregnancy policy ignores readiness while favoring
protection of individuals' rights.  As the number of women in
the Navy increases, pregnancy becomes a serious readiness issue.
<P>
At any given time, up to 18 percent of Navy women are pregnant
and a study of two ships showed a pregnancy rate as high as one
in three.[8] That's nearly 8,423 women or enough to crew almost
two aircraft carriers.  During Desert Storm 1,145 women on ships
needed to be reassigned because of pregnancies, at an average
of 95 per month.[9]
<P>
According to the policy, a woman may serve aboard ship until she
is 20 weeks pregnant.  While aboard ship, she must never be more
than six hours from emergency OB/GYN care.  Perhaps this provision
exists because at least five babies have been born on Navy ships,
one of which died shortly after birth.  Obviously, this policy
limits the pregnant sailor's deployability and her job performance
is frequently limited.
<P>
On average, each pregnancy taken to term removes a female sailor
from her ship for at least six months.  Once the child is born,
the sailor receives six weeks of convalescent leave and is not
required to re-deploy for four months.  That period can be extended
by the attending physician.  Many women never return to their
ship after giving birth.  According to Navy records, 35 percent
leave the Navy and eight percent remain on shore.    
<P>
Those who do return are unable to devote full time to their infant,
often creating an unhealthy reliance on child care at an extremely
impressionable age for the child.  Extended care for children
during frequent deployments denies the child the nurturing that
is key to a balanced emotional composition.   
<P>
According to Jay Belsky writing in the <I>Journal of Marriage
and the Family</I>, children left in child care while mothers
work &quot;scored more poorly on a composite measure of adjustment
than did children whose mothers were not employed during their
first three years....[and they] were significantly more noncompliant
than agemates without such early experience.&quot;[10]  These problems
are made worse as the mother-child separations are longer and
more frequent.
<P>
According to the Defense Manpower Data Center, two thirds of all
uniformed female mothers of one child have never married.  There
are never-married servicemembers with as many as nine dependents.
 Today, there are 84,831 never-married female active duty members
from all services with at least one child.[11]
<P>
Unmarried female servicemembers with at-home dependents are eligible
for benefits identical to married members.  For example, they
receive larger government quarters (more children means more bedrooms),
larger allowances driven by family size (such as cost of living
allowances), government-subsidized child care and medical care.
 During each pregnancy the servicemember is provided all pay and
allowances, time off and free medical benefits.
<P>
If a pregnant sailor wants an abortion she must be transported
off the ship to a location near an abortion clinic.  Before this
happens Navy personnel must counsel her about her options.  If
she chooses abortion, she is given, at government expense, a complete
blood count (CBC) to determine whether to administer Rhogam to
prevent an immune reaction.  After the abortion, the Navy provides
medical attention for problems arising from the procedure, like
clinical depression or an incomplete abortion.  The costs for
this treatment are borne by the Navy.
<P>
Navy policy prohibits supervisors from taking action against a
woman who becomes pregnant during a deployment, and there is no
requirement for women to use birth control during deployments.
 One command did, however, send a message to all ship captains
directing them to counsel their female sailors about the advantages
of NORPLANT, the under-the-skin birth control device.[12] 
<P>
<CENTER><H3>SEX TAKES PLACE AFLOAT</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Two sailors aboard the <I>USS Eisenhower</I> were recently punished
for having sex, videotaping the event and then showing it to fellow
sailors.  The sailors were charged with adultery, since each of
them was married to someone else.  The incident shows that mixing
men and women in close quarters for extended periods can lead
to misconduct, and it has serious implications for morale.
<P>
The number of pregnancies aboard the USS Eisenhower, the first
combat vessel with female crewmembers, grew from five to 39 in
a couple months.  In all, 13 percent of the female crew became
pregnant.  By comparison, less than four percent of the male crewmembers
left the <I>Eisenhower</I> for medical reasons since April 1994.[13]
<P>
An active duty Naval officer with recent at-sea experience supervising
female sailors claims that every ship has &quot;large numbers
of pregnancies.&quot;  This officer alleges that advancement in
the Navy depends on supporting the &quot;vital program of women
at sea&quot; and he is &quot;not sure the Navy [has] thought through
the pregnancy issue.&quot;[14]
<P>
A seasoned chief petty officer who recently supervised women aboard
ship alleges that many women &quot;get pregnant to avoid deployment.&quot;
 He believes that many &quot;Generation X&quot; women are in the
Navy for financial gain, the education and to find a husband.
 Sex aboard ship is common.  As a supervisor who wouldn't tolerate
sexual liaisons among crewmembers,  he claims that his disapproving
female subordinates were very uncooperative with him due to his
lack of tolerance of their fraternization.
<P>
The chief alleges that many of his female subordinates were untrained
prior to a recent deployment because they had only been recently
reassigned to the crew.  They were replacing other females who
&quot;got pregnant at the last minute.&quot;  It is difficult
to replace women with men, because ships are now configured to
accommodate a specified number of billets for each sex. 
<P>
Apart from the immediate shipboard impact, the policy hurts family
members who stay ashore and worry about the sexual climate to
which their spouses are being subjected.  An officer's wife recently
wrote about sexual tensions in Haiti.  Two men shared a tent with
a female officer who &quot;made it known that she was open to
intimate relationships.&quot;  The male officer indicated the
situation made him &quot;uncomfortable and awkward&quot; and it
&quot;was to him professionally and personally&quot; distressing.
 He had recently married and his wife was pregnant with their
first child.[15] Military wives often worry about the prospects that
their husbands might be sexually preyed upon by women willing
to use sex for personal gain.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>AFFIRMATIVE ACTION COMES ABOARD</H3></CENTER>
<P>
There is growing anecdotal evidence that shows that female sailors
get special treatment.  Consider several incidents.
<P>
A female sailor aboard the <I>USS Eisenhower</I> was disciplined
for &quot;falling in love.&quot;  Her punishment was three days
on bread and water in a Navy brig.  Since the carrier has no female
jail, she was sent ashore to Rota, Spain via an Italian island,
Italy, Germany and finally Spain.  En route to Rota, she and her
two escorts shopped and dined their way for five days, all at
government expense.  She told the <I>Norfolk Virginian-Pilot and
Ledger-Star</I>, &quot;I was free to go.  We went out to eat,
to the shopping malls in Italy and we stayed in hotels.  It had
to be a huge expense.&quot;[16] Some &quot;punishment.&quot;
<P>
The 19-year-old claims she was the only female crewmember disciplined
for breaking the captain's no-dating policy and alleges other
women were found &quot;with their boyfriends kissing in closets
and other hideaways aboard ship.&quot;[17]
<P>
Tragedies which involve Navy women have also been handled in an
unusual fashion.  The fatal crash of an F-14A Tomcat fighter on
October 25, 1994 is revealing.  In an unprecedented move, the
Navy released Lieutenant Kara S. Hultgreen's training records
to the media and her mother, Sally Spears.  It also went to great
lengths to recover the aircraft from the ocean floor.  Finally,
it released a video showing Hultgreen's last carrier approach.
<P>
Although initial reports blamed a failed engine for the crash,
on March 14, 1995, the Mishap Investigation Report (MIR) contained
&quot;...repeated instances of pilot error.  It notes the role
of engine trouble but concludes that Hultgreen's flight-control
mistakes were the most critical factors [in the accident].&quot;[18]
 The MIR, written to exacting standards, is classified as &quot;privileged&quot;
and is used for improving the safety of future flights.
<P>
On March 7, 1995 a female Navy pilot called a live national radio
show from the deck of the <I>USS Abraham Lincoln</I>, the same
carrier to which Hultgreen was assigned.  This F-18 pilot called
to promote women in combat aircraft.  She explained that the &quot;women
in the military&quot; debate is about &quot;equal opportunity&quot;
and as far as she is concerned there is &quot;no problem.&quot;[19]
<P>
In August 1994, a male Navy pilot told his boss that he objected
to women serving in combat, but would follow orders.  He now faces
dismissal for failing to &quot;demonstrate leadership&quot; despite
having received outstanding efficiency reports.[20]
<P>
Another male officer alleges that women are receiving preferential
treatment for command and promotions.  One female officer was
selected to become a ship's executive officer after only three
years of sea duty.  The more seasoned male officer explained that
the standard has long been no less than six to eight years of
sea duty before eligibility for this coveted assignment.  He also
cited the example of a female commander who was excused for hitting
a sea buoy, an act which is normally a career killer.  
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CHARGES OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The 1991 Tailhook convention branded the Navy as a haven of sexual
harassers.  Even though much of the evidence is contradictory,
the Navy has suffered serious public relations damage.
<P>
In the wake of Tailhook, several key senior Navy leaders have
taken direct hits from women alleging sexual harassment.  Admiral
Stanley Arthur decided to drop a female lieutenant with poor flying
skills from helicopter aviation training.  The lieutenant claimed
that she had been eliminated from flight school because of &quot;retaliation&quot;
for filing a successful sexual harassment complaint.  The man
involved in the harassment charge was punished for making inappropriate
comments and has since left the Navy.
<P>
Adm. Arthur reviewed the lieutenant's record and found evidence
of poor aptitude and performance both before and after the harassment
incident.  He wrote: &quot;From this review I do not have sufficient
confidence that [the lieutenant] could safely and successfully
operate an aircraft in a dangerous and unforgiving operational
environment....I do not desire to see her or perhaps others die
because she could not perform at a level consistent with our standards.&quot;[21]
<P>
The admiral had been nominated to become Commander in Chief of
Naval Forces in the Pacific (CINCPAC).  After his decision, his
confirmation was procedurally shelved possibly because of threats
from congresswomen like Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-CO) who fought
the retirement status of outgoing Chief of Naval Operations Frank
B. Kelso II, who oversaw the Tailhook investigation.  The Navy
withdrew the Arthur nomination.
<P>
Tragically, Coast Guard Captain Ernest J. Blanchard IV took his
own life after learning of an investigation into remarks he allegedly
made at a dinner at the Coast Guard Academy on January 10, 1995.
 An officer who attended the dinner said, &quot;I heard the remark
that some of the things the speaker said would have been OK maybe
20 years ago....I guess they were jokes, off-color remarks, not
politically correct.  Some women in the humanities department
apparently complained about the comments.&quot;[22]
<P>
Blanchard, considered a rising star in the Coast Guard, wrote
a formal letter of apology to the &quot;offended&quot; woman,
but it was not accepted.  The female officer pressed her allegations.
 Blanchard offered to retire but permission was denied.  Friends
believe that he felt that his character was being assailed and
that he was being treated as an example by the Coast Guard.
<P>
In other instances, remarks by junior officers have met with charges
of sexual harassment.  For example, when a petty officer reported
that two of his subordinates were having a lesbian relationship,
the women responded by alleging sexual harassment.  The senior
chief was removed from the ship.
<P>
Another officer was removed for being a &quot;gender offender.&quot;
 The first words out of his boss's mouth were: &quot;You're guilty
of sexual harassment,&quot; a clear violation of the long tradition
of being held innocent until proven guilty.  
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CONCLUSION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The Clinton Administration's decision to scuttle exemptions for
women and to embrace the feminization of the Navy has seriously
damaged readiness.  The 104th Congress should reverse the current
trend before irreparable harm is done to the U.S. Navy and the
defense posture of the nation.

<P>
John Cardinal O'Connor of New York has defined two conditions
-- and two conditions only -- that justify opposing the anti-illegitimacy
measures recently adopted by the House.  His opposition hinges,
first, on the &quot;virtual inevitability&quot; that a freeze
on benefits &quot;amounts to a programmed 'short-term' increase
in abortions&quot; and, second, on the lack of &quot;any hard
evidence&quot; to support the contention that reducing illegitimacy
will reduce abortions.[1]
<P>
The Cardinal's principled objections deserve an answer, and all
people of faith should be relieved by the fact that we do have
hard evidence to allay both of his concerns.  Given the weight
of evidence suggesting that abortions will not increase in the
short term and will in fact decrease in the long term, those who
defend the status quo on moral or empirical grounds must now bear
the burden of proof.  And those who have been both puzzled and
troubled by the rift in the pro-life ranks over this issue must
understand that the division springs not from a different understanding
of our moral responsibilities, but from a different degree of
reliance on the actual empirical record.
<P>
While it is far too premature to draw any decisive conclusions
from the welfare experiment in New Jersey, there is absolutely
no statistical indication as of yet that an increase in abortions
has occurred since the state's family cap took effect August 1,
1993.  In fact, the total number of Medicaid-funded abortions
in New Jersey declined from 13,629 in 1993 to 13,424 in 1994.[2]
<P>
Because Medicaid data is collected by date of payment, rather
than procurement, the raw numbers do contain some distortion.
 Yet any Medicaid-funded abortion occurring within approximately
the first year after implementation of the cap is included in
the current data set.  While the 1994 numbers are still subject
to some adjustment to reflect the most recent abortions for which
no claim has yet been filed, the existing margin between the totals
for 1993 and 1994 can accommodate the anticipated inflation without
threatening the indication that abortions have not surged upward
as feared.
<P>
Likewise, the number of privately funded abortions performed on
welfare mothers
 is expected to be too negligible to affect the finding that abortions
have not significantly increased (especially since the average
cost of an abortion in New Jersey in 1993 was equal to eight times
the $64 amount by which the new policy reduces the benefits package
each month).  Although no hard data is available to address the
question, Susan Tew of the Alan Guttmacher Institute commented
that &quot;it logically does not make sense to suggest that women
who are in severe financial straits and are eligible for a publicly
funded abortion would forgo those Medicaid dollars in lieu of
scarce private resources.&quot;  No data is available, she noted,
precisely because the possibility that welfare women forgo available
public funding for the abortions they choose to have is too remote
to merit the expenditure of research dollars.[3] 
<P>
The only other significant objection to the use of Medicaid data
-- the only data we have at present -- is that the population
includes approximately 57,000 women (ages 16-45) who are eligible
for Medicaid, but are not subject to the Family Development Program
(FDP) in New Jersey that included the family cap.  The presence
of such a sizeable group of women who are not subject to the new
welfare policy could conceivably mask an increase in abortions;
but the fact that the non-FDP population remained virtually unchanged
between 1993 and 1994 suggests that there is no hidden increase
lurking in the short-run data.
<P>
Anita Leone, executive director of an association that represents
all the publicly-funded abortion clinics in New Jersey, confirmed
in a recent interview: &quot;We know that abortions in New Jersey
are currently decreasing.  We just don't know why.&quot;  Since
the decline in the birth rate among welfare mothers in New Jersey
has been rather substantial since implementation of the family
cap (estimates range at least as high as 11.4 percent[4]), the fact
that an increase in abortions is not yet indicated is significant.
<P>
The anecdotal evidence collected by those who are on the frontlines
of welfare reform in New Jersey confirms the general pattern that
is beginning to emerge from the data.  Richard Traynor of the
Legal Center for Defense of Life in New Jersey and David Sciarra
of New Jersey Legal Services, who together filed a class-action
suit over the New Jersey family cap, both commented in telephone
interviews that the class was certified to include welfare mothers
who had aborted their babies -- but that neither one could locate
a woman who had actually aborted in the wake of the cap.
<P>
Instead, the only plaintiffs who mention abortion in their affidavits
explain that they consciously decided on moral grounds not to
terminate their pregnancies, despite increased economic pressures.
 One woman testified that she made an appointment at an abortion
clinic but ultimately &quot;became very upset about having an
abortion and decided that [she] could not go through with it.&quot;
 Another woman who already had two children and was carrying triplets
-- three times the pressure -- never even considered abortion.[5]
<P>
The decision to abort, the evidence suggests, is uniquely invulnerable
to rational economic incentives.  And welfare mothers are apparently
more inclined to consider &quot;non-rational&quot; factors than
any other population group.  Public opinion data collected by
the Family Research Council suggest that abortion is even more
morally repugnant to poor women;[6] and the fact that abortion rates
for teen welfare mothers are <I>lower</I> than national averages
for all teenage girls is a powerful indication that non-economic
factors determine the decision to carry a child to term.[7]
<P>
Many who now argue otherwise are precisely the ones who maintain
that the current benefits level is already far too low to cover
the costs associated with a new baby.  If so, it is illogical
to predict that a cap would have a sufficiently significant impact
on the &quot;affordability&quot; of another child to trigger such
a drastic measure as abortion.
<P>
State-by-state data from the 1980s demonstrates that small changes
in welfare payouts do not affect abortion rates in the short term;[8]
and Michael Schwartz of Life Advocacy Alliance has found in analyzing
more recent data that states with the highest average monthly
benefit for a family of three also tend to have the highest ratio
of abortions to live births.[9]
<P>
Not surprisingly, then, the only &quot;evidence&quot; the plaintiffs
could offer in the New Jersey suit was 55 letters from pro-life
activists expressing concern that freezing benefits might increase
abortions.  As of yet, there is nothing more concrete than their
concern itself to corroborate their claims; and pro-lifers who
are unconvinced by the hearsay -- including John Tomicki, past
president of New Jersey Right to Life -- have concluded that welfare
reform itself is a pro-life cause.
<P>
Contrary to Cardinal O'Connor's assertion, we do have compelling
statistical evidence to suggest that reducing illegitimacy will
reduce abortions.  Robert Rector of the Heritage Foundation has
found an astronomically high correlation between abortion and
illegitimacy in a state-by-state analysis.  His study shows that
an increase of 100 in the number of illegitimate births per 10,000
women, in fact, results in an increase of 200 in the number of
abortions per 10,000 women.[10]
<P>
The vast majority of abortions are performed on unmarried women
-- and the proportion is growing.  To reduce abortions, we must
reduce the premarital sex and out-of-wedlock pregnancy that create
a perceived &quot;need&quot; for abortion.  Marriage affords the
best protection -- indeed, the only real hope -- for the children
of the poor.
<P>
In deference to that fact, John Paul II wrote in his most recent
encyclical <I>Evangelium Vitae</I> that &quot;[a] general <I>and
no less serious </I>responsibility [for abortion] lies with those
who have encouraged the spread of an attitude of sexual permissiveness
and a lack of esteem for motherhood, and with those who should
have ensured -- but did not -- effective family and social policies
in support of families.&quot;[11]
<P>
The Pope's teaching leaves ample room for inferring that a program
that undermines families and promotes sexual immorality as effectively
as our current welfare system does is equally responsible for
abortion as permissive abortion laws.  Those who countenance the
status quo in welfare countenance a system rife with abortion.
 And those who fight for welfare reform wage a war against abortion
that is no less morally valid than peaceful sit-ins, prayer vigils,
and reform of law.

Evelyn Hooker has been among the most influential figures in the
highly successful movement to convince the American people that
homosexuality is a &quot;normal variant&quot; of human sexual
behavior.  Her 1957 study, &quot;The Adjustment of the Male Overt
Homosexual&quot; (<I>Journal of Projective Techniques,</I> 1957,
21, 18-31) is the most frequently cited scientific source for
the argument that homosexuality is not a pathology, that homosexuals
are as free from mental disorder as heterosexuals.  
<P>
Such assertions have not only found their way into standard psychology
textbooks but have also provided a scientific basis for decisions
in major court cases involving the legality of state sodomy laws
and prohibitions against homosexual employment in certain state
and local agencies (e.g., schools, police departments).  Indeed,
when the American Psychiatric Association debated the issue of
homosexuality in 1973, Evelyn Hooker's work was Exhibit A for
those who wanted to remove homosexuality from the group's list
of mental disorders. 
<P>
For many commentators and activists, the Hooker study effectively
ended the debate over whether or not homosexuals were in any way
abnormal in their relationships with each other and with the community
at large.  Today many Americans have accepted the idea that homosexuality
is &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;healthy&quot; without realizing
that such an opinion is derived in large measure from a single
study -- one conducted by a UCLA professor whose previous laboratory
subjects had been rats.  
<P>
In all this extravagant homage to Hooker and her study, several
points have escaped her admirers, to say nothing of the federal
courts: 
<P>
1. In her 1957 report, Evelyn Hooker did not use a random sample
to test the stability of homosexuals, but allowed gay rights activists
to recruit those homosexuals most likely to illustrate her thesis
that homosexuality is not a pathology.  Individuals who proved
unstable were deleted from the final sample.
<P>
2. Hooker's published account of how she recruited heterosexual
subjects is not consistent with a more detailed later account.
<P>
3. Six subjects in her study, three from each group, had engaged
in both homosexual and heterosexual behavior beyond adolescence.
<P>
4. Hooker made several errors in her mathematical calculations
that raise doubts about her care and competence as a researcher.
<P>
5. Hooker did not attempt to prove that homosexuals were normal
in every way, nor does her study support the idea that homosexuals
as a group are just as stable as heterosexuals.
<P>
6. Hooker was relatively inexperienced in administering the Rorschach
test, and this inexperience may have led to mistakes in the administration
and evaluation of the Rorschach.
<P>
7. On the Thematic Apperception Test and the Make-A-Picture-Story
test -- which require subjects to make up fictional narratives
about depicted scenes -- the homosexuals could not refrain from
including homosexual fantasies in their imaginary accounts.  For
that reason, Hooker altered the nature of the study by no longer
asking the judges to use the TAT and MAPS in an attempt to determine
the sexual orientation of each of the 60 subjects, since the differences
were apparent from the narratives.
<P>
In order to understand fully the nature of the controversy over
Hooker's study, it is helpful to review its history.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>THE HISTORY OF THE HOOKER STUDY</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Evelyn Hooker did not begin her research on homosexuals as a logical
development in her career as a psychologist or even out of a dispassionate
scientific curiosity. From all indications, she undertook the
study to prove that homosexuals could function as normal human
beings.  As she herself said, &quot;How could my hypothesis have
been anything else?  I'd seen these men and saw nothing psychopathological
in their behavior.&quot;[1]
<P>
&quot;These men&quot; were the many friends she'd made in the
Los Angeles homosexual community -- one of whom, Sam From, persuaded
her to undertake the investigation.  &quot;Now we have let you
see us as we are,&quot; he said to the UCLA professor.  &quot;It
is your scientific duty to do a study of people like us.&quot;[2]
 Despite the fact that she was a &quot;rat runner&quot; -- with
no clinical experience in the area of human behavior, she undertook
her study, which would become, along with the Kinsey report, a
prime weapon in the hands of the gay rights movement.
<P>
It is important to examine carefully the manner in which Hooker
planned and executed her research, which was funded by the federal
government's National Institute of Mental Health.  A number of
commentators have failed to read Hooker's own report carefully
or else have deliberately distorted her methods and findings for
their own purposes.  Here is just how she proceeded and what she
found.         
<P>
<CENTER><H3>SELECTION OF SUBJECTS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
First, to find her homosexual subjects, she enlisted the early
gay rights group Mattachine Society, which, as she put it in her
published report, &quot;has as its stated purpose the development
of a homosexual ethic....&quot;[3] Members of the Mattachine Society
volunteered for the study and also recruited their friends.  Hooker,
herself, created a &quot;control group&quot; of heterosexuals
for the experiment, despite the fact that on the standardized
tests she intended to use, norms had already been established.
<P>
In her 1957 report, Hooker offers this somewhat cryptic explanation
of heterosexual recruitment:
<P>
Because the heterosexuals were, for the most part, obtained from
community organizations which must remain anonymous, I cannot
describe further the way in which they were obtained.[4]
<P>
Years later, a <I>Los Angeles Times</I> reporter elicited from
Hooker a somewhat different explanation, one that is fairly explicit
in detail:
<P>
She canvassed the education secretaries of labor unions, thinking
that they would have liberal attitudes.  &quot;I was wrong,&quot;
she says; as soon as she explained the nature of the study, no
one wanted to participate...So Hooker took to collaring candidates
wherever she could find them, including a fireman who showed up
to inspect her home.  &quot;No man is safe on Saltair Street,&quot;
joked her husband.[5] 
<P>
She did not insist on a random sampling.  In fact, she deliberately
sought out only those subjects who seemed stable and &quot;normal&quot;
-- at least in their ability to adjust to their social environment.
 She defined the criteria for membership in the groups as follows:
<P>
In both groups subjects were eliminated who were in therapy at
the time.  If, in the preliminary screening, evidence of considerable
disturbance appeared, the individual was eliminated (5 heterosexuals;
5 homosexuals).[6]
<P>
As for the sexual proclivities of the participants, Hooker says
the following in her report:
<P>
I attempted to secure homosexuals who would be pure for homosexuality;
that is, without heterosexual experience.  With three exceptions
this is so.  These three subjects had not had more than three
heterosexual experiences, and they identified themselves as homosexual
in their patterns of desire and behavior.  The heterosexual group
is exclusively heterosexual beyond the adolescent period, with
three exceptions; these three had had a single homosexual experience
each.[7]
<P>
Originally, she chose 40 homosexual subjects and matched them
as closely as possible by age, IQ, and education with 40 heterosexual
subjects.  At some point, as noted parenthetically above, she
found five from each group too unbalanced to include in her study,
so apparently she dropped these ten and their matches in the opposite
groups -- for a total of 20 eliminated.  This winnowing process
reduced the size of the total pool from 80 to 60.
<P>
It is instructive to read her summary of these matchings and then
compare that summary to the chart containing the same information.
<P>
The homosexuals, and thus the heterosexuals, ranged in age from
25 to 50, with an average age of 34.5 for the homosexual group
and 36.6 for the heterosexual group.  The IQ range, as measured
by the Otis Self-Administering Tests of Mental Ability, was from
90 to 135, with an average for the homosexual group of 115.4 and
for the heterosexual group of 116.2.  In education the range was
from completion of grammar school to the equivalent of a master's
degree, with an average for the homosexual group of 13.9 years
and for the heterosexual group of 14.3.[8]
<P>
Turning to the table upon which she lists the age, IQ scores,
and education of all 60 subjects, a careful reader finds that
the figures neatly arranged in columns <I>contradict her summary</I>.
 While she says the age range for all subjects is 25-50, the chart
indicates that the youngest subject is 26 and the oldest 57. 
The figures on the table indicate an average age of 35 for the
homosexuals and 37 for the heterosexuals -- different averages
than the ones Hooker gives.
<P>
In her summary, she says the range of IQ scores is 90-135, but
the lowest IQ score on her chart is 91.  Despite this error, however,
her averages for both homosexuals and heterosexuals are consistent
with the chart.
<P>
On average years of education, she gives as a range the completion
of grammar school to the equivalent of a masters degree.  Here
her summary is at best imprecise, since the least amount of education
is 9 years -- past the junior high level and three years beyond
elementary school.  The highest educational level indicated on
the chart is 18 years, which is a year beyond the course requirement
for most master's programs.  Also, her average education for homosexuals,
based on the chart, should be 14.0 rather than 13.9.
<P>
These mathematical discrepancies are minor but disturbing.  If
all the averages had been incorrect, a generous reader might have
concluded that somehow she had printed the wrong chart -- a single
careless error.  But given the accuracy of <I>some</I> of her
calculations, it seems more likely she made several careless errors.
 A footnote on the first page of the Hooker report suggests that
the materials were rushed into print -- that, though she hesitated
to publish her paper, &quot;[i]n view of the importance of her
findings it seemed desirable to the editors that they be made
public....&quot;[9]  (In other words, she was saying something that
well-placed members of the profession wanted to hear.)      
<P>
To be sure, these figures are largely irrelevant to the final
conclusions of her study.  The averages of ages, IQ scores, and
amount of education lend only marginal credibility to the selection
process.  Yet the inaccuracies tell us something important about
Hooker's reliability as a researcher, the degree to which we can
trust her methodology.  As noted below, Hooker scored the Rorschach
test herself, despite the fact that she had had little previous
experience in this area.  Add to this inexperience a lack of mathematical
precision, and the study begins to pose genuine problems. 
<P>
At this point, two observations are in order concerning Hooker's
overall method of selecting her subjects.  First, in choosing
a small sample that is anything but random, Hooker has declined
to test the proposition that homosexuals and heterosexuals in
society are equally likely to be normal, well-adjusted human beings.
 As she, herself, says in the report, she is only interested in
&quot;whether homosexuality is <I>necessarily</I> [emphasis added]
a symptom of pathology.&quot;  To answer that question, she maintains,
&quot;All we need is a single case in which the answer is negative.&quot;[10]
 In other words, in this study she is concerned with finding at
least one homosexual who, after testing, doesn't fall into the
category of &quot;pathological.&quot;  This is why she has focused
on the healthiest possible cohort.    
<P>
But the limited scope of her study cuts two ways.  Knowing the
nature of the sample, no one could reasonably conclude from her
findings that homosexuals as a group are no more likely to be
mentally disturbed than heterosexuals.  Yet this is precisely
what many have concluded.  If one accepts the study as valid and
definitive, one can only conclude that some homosexuals are not
pathological <I>in their dealings with the world at large.</I>
  As Hooker herself observes, there is no evidence to conclude
that homosexuals are not pathological in their sexual activities.
<P>
A second point to note about Hooker's selection process is her
ease in recruiting homosexual subjects and her difficulty in recruiting
heterosexual subjects.  Indeed, her account in the study report
is evasive; and her later recollections suggest that she may have
shaded the truth initially in order to cover up problems she encountered
in recruiting the control group.         
<P>
This question becomes more pressing when one reads that in her
group of 30 heterosexual men, she still must include three who
have had homosexual experiences <I>in their adult lives</I> --
by no means a &quot;pure&quot; sample -- and we don't know how
many more had had homosexual experiences in adolescence.  No one
-- not even Kinsey -- would call this an unambiguously heterosexual
group.
<P>
From Hooker's own report -- and from a follow-up interview in
later years -- we see that homosexuals were not only eager to
participate, but indeed were the instigators of the study.  They
hoped that it would prove they were &quot;normal&quot; human beings;
so they scoured their own community to find just the right volunteers
to prove her limited hypothesis.  When analyzing the results of
the Hooker study, it's very important to remember who instigated
the project and the fact that the subjects were well aware of
its ultimate goal.  (In light of this fact, the performance of
homosexuals on two of the three tests, as discussed below, may
well indicate that homosexuality generates social behavior that
is obsessive, indeed all but uncontrollable -- certainly one indication
of pathology.) 
<P>
<CENTER><H3>THE TESTING OF THE SUBJECTS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
To prove her thesis, Hooker administered three standardized tests
to her 60 subjects -- the Rorschach Test, the Thematic Apperception
Test (TAT), and the Make-A-Picture-Story test (MAPS).  The Rorschach
test, as most people know, consists of a series of ink blots that
subjects are asked to interpret.  The Thematic Apperception Test
requires subjects to describe and make up stories about pictures
of people in various settings.  The MAPS test requires subjects
to arrange cut-out pictures and then make up a story about their
arrangement.   
<P>
Despite her lack of clinical experience in what is called &quot;projective
techniques,&quot; according to Hooker, she administered and scored
the Rorschach test herself.  After scoring the test and constructing
profiles, she placed the results in random order and passed them
along to two experts in Rorschach analysis.  Thus we have Hooker's
scored results analyzed by Drs. Klopfer and Meyer, with two tasks
in mind: first, to rate the subjects on &quot;overall adjustment&quot;
and second, to see if they could determine which were the homosexuals
and which were the heterosexuals.
<P>
On the task of determining overall adjustment (i.e., social stability),
the judges differed sharply in some respects but agreed in others.
 For example, Judge &quot;A&quot; rated 15 of the 60 as &quot;top&quot;
in stability, while Judge &quot;B&quot; rated only 4 as &quot;top.&quot;
 The other ratings revealed greater agreement. However, more homosexuals
than heterosexuals ranked in the two &quot;top&quot; groupings
and more heterosexuals than homosexuals ranked in the two &quot;bottom&quot;
groupings.
<P>
When assigned the task of choosing between the homosexual and
heterosexual subjects, Judge &quot;A&quot; correctly identified
17 of the 30 pairs and Judge &quot;B&quot; 18 of the 30.  An ideal
random selection would have identified 15 out of 30, though Hooker
is technically correct in saying that, in such a small sample,
the results indicate that &quot;neither judge was able to do better
than chance.&quot;[11]
<P>
Critics of Hooker's Rorschach results make at least two points.
 First, they question her ability to administer and score the
test.  As an animal researcher until the time she undertook this
project, she obviously had logged comparatively little experience
in administering Rorschachs, a delicate and highly complicated
task in which the clinician gently and obliquely elicits spontaneous
responses.  Some authorities in the field maintain that, under
ideal circumstances, a more qualified expert would have explored
many avenues Hooker failed to note and would have found out many
things Hooker missed -- including indications of the pathology
of the homosexuals.
<P>
A second criticism of her methodology is the lack of &quot;blindness&quot;
in the administration of the Rorschach.  Ideally, given the nature
of the results sought, the test should have been administered
under circumstances in which both interviewer and subject were
unaware of the purpose of the test.  In the case of the Hooker
study, both she and her subjects knew what she was striving to
prove -- and both she and the homosexuals had a vested interest
in proving the hypothesis that homosexuals were not necessarily
pathological.
<P>
Can Rorschach subjects tailor their answers to desired ends? 
Absolutely, say some Rorschach experts.  One example of such a
phenomenon in &quot;projective techniques&quot; is called the
&quot;Rosenthal Effect,&quot; in which a subject generates the
results he or she believes the researcher wants.  In this particular
case, both the researcher (Hooker) and her homosexual subjects
had a compelling reason to produce these results.
<P>
Perhaps the most significant implications of Hooker's study came
from the MAPS and TAT results, which were analyzed by a single
judge.  Here is Hooker's own account:
<P>
The problem of identifying the homosexual protocol from this
material was essentially a much easier one than that encountered
with the Rorschach, since few homosexuals failed to give open
[sic] homosexual stories on at least one picture.  The second
task given the Rorschach judges, of distinguishing the homosexual
from the heterosexual records when they were presented in matched
pairs, was therefore omitted.[12]
<P>
Note that the identity of the homosexuals was so obvious in these
tests that Hooker did not even ask the judge to distinguish between
homosexual and heterosexual.  Simply put, the homosexuals gave
themselves away on tests less dependent than the Rorschach on
the training and experience of the examiner.  Despite the fact
that they knew the purpose of this test was to prove their own
stability, normalcy, and lack of differentiation from heterosexuals,
they still did not refrain from indulging themselves in homosexual
fantasies, thereby exposing their sexual appetites.  It is difficult
not to conclude that in verbalizing such fantasies, they were
exhibiting the obsessive nature of homosexuality, the difficulty
of homosexuals to control their desire, even when their reputation
in the psychiatric community was at stake.
<P>
As one research analyst puts it:
<P>
So Hooker's study suggests that sexual fantasies among homosexuals
are irrepressible, so much so that such people cannot always see
ordinary situations and relations as devoid of sexual content,
but must, on occasion, interject sexual significance where it
does not exist or, at the very least, need not exist.  Following
the logical conclusions of this experiment, we are compelled to
conclude that there is something substantively different about
the way homosexuals and heterosexuals look at the world.[13]
<P>
In evaluating the MAPS and TAT results for stability, the single
judge assigned &quot;top&quot; scores to no one; 9 homosexuals
and 7 heterosexuals were rated &quot;next to top&quot;; 15 homosexuals
and 19 heterosexuals were ranked &quot;average&quot;; 6 homosexuals
and 3 heterosexuals were rated &quot;next to bottom&quot;; and
no homosexuals and 1 heterosexual were ranked at the &quot;bottom.&quot;
 (Again, critics say that the absence of &quot;blindness&quot;
raises the possibility that the Rosenthal Effect was again operative
in the evaluation process, since the judge knew what Hooker was
seeking.)
<P>
<CENTER><H3>SUMMARY OF RESULTS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The remainder of her study is a highly selective summary of comments
by judges, all of which support her thesis that the two groups
are, in effect, indistinguishable in terms of &quot;overall adjustment.&quot;
 In her own evaluation of the results, Hooker -- aware of the
degree to which she is challenging leading authorities in the
field -- offers a set of &quot;admissions&quot; about the limitations
of her study.  In this section she concedes the possibility that
homosexuals are indeed pathological, a point overlooked by most
of her admirers.
<P><UL>
<LI>She speculates that the psychological defect of homosexuals
may lie &quot;in a weakness of ego-function and control and that
this cannot be adequately diagnosed from projective test protocols.
 As one psychiatrist puts it, the material produced in the Rorschach
is like that produced on the analytic couch.  Two men may produce
very similar material on the couch, but the difference between
them is that one -- the normal -- gets up at the end of the hour
and resumes his normal functioning, while the other does not.&quot;[14]
<P>
<LI>She also admits that the pathology of homosexuality may only
occur &quot;in an erotic situation and that the homosexual can
function well in non-erotic situations such as the Rorschach,
TAT, and MAPS.  Thus, one could defend the hypothesis that homosexuality
is symptomatic of pathology, but that the pathology is confined
to one sector of behavior, namely, the sexual.&quot;[15] (She seems
to have disproved this proposition by her own study, since the
homosexuals were unable to control their sexual fantasies, even
in a &quot;non-erotic situation&quot; such as taking the MAPS
and TAT.)
<P>
<LI>During Hooker's research, she took the life histories of her
subjects; and though she didn't include an analysis of these materials
in her study, she did indicate that when she eventually published
her results, &quot;the life history data from the two groups will
differ:  namely, in the love relationships.  Comparisons between
the number and duration of love relationships, cruising patterns,
and degree of satisfaction with sexual pattern and the love partner
will certainly show clear-cut differences.&quot;[16]
</UL>
Hooker never published the summary of these histories, though
in a fairly recent interview with writer-researcher Edward Eichel,
she said she still hoped to do so after 35 years.  However, she
undoubtedly found in these personal histories what most other
researchers have found:  a substantially greater number of sexual
partners among homosexuals than heterosexuals and a significantly
shorter duration in relationships.  These findings, if published,
could well have cast further doubts on the stability and normalcy
of homosexuals.
<P>
It is significant to note that Hooker's stated reservations seldom,
if ever, find their way into the summaries of her work -- summaries
that are now <I>de rigeur</I> in legal and scholarly discussions
of homosexuality.  Her 1957 report has, like a folk tale, become
simpler and purer in the constant retelling.  Instead of a complicated
account filled with the predictable complexity of life, we now
have only Beauty and the Beast.     
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CITATIONS AND  USES OF THE HOOKER STUDY</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Perhaps as important as the Hooker 1957 research itself is the
use that others have made of her findings.  Not only has this
single study with only 60 subjects been cited repeatedly by prominent
psychiatrists, social critics, and gay activists; but such summaries
have also been accepted as part of the expert testimony in high-profile
court cases nationwide.
<P>
Curiously, many of those who cite the study not only incorrectly
summarize its content but do so in remarkably similar fashion.
 It's as if one commentator misread Hooker and all the rest derived
their knowledge from that single erroneous commentary.  Here are
several examples:     
<P><UL>
<LI>In the <I>Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry</I>, Dr. Judd
Marmor, a driving force in the American Psychiatric Association's
decision to drop homosexuality from its manual of disorders, has
written this summary of Hooker's research: &quot;Hooker (1957)
conducted a cooperative study of 30 male homosexuals and 30 male
heterosexuals who were matched for age, I.Q., and education. 
The homosexuals were all rated 6 and the heterosexuals 0 on the
Kinsey scale.  None of the subjects was in therapy.  Two judges
independently, without prior knowledge of which subjects were
which, reviewed the Rorschach protocols, Thematic Apperception
Tests, and Make-a-Picture-Story responses, and tried to distinguish
the homosexuals from the heterosexuals, but they were unable to
do so.&quot;[17]
<P><UL>
<LI>Marmor repeated this very passage when he submitted an affidavit
in <I>Morales v. Texas</I>, a case heard before a state court
in Texas.
<P>
<LI>Dr. Gregory Herek supported Marmor's testimony in <I>Morales
v. Texas</I>, saying under oath: &quot;The classic study in this
case was conducted by Hooker (1957).  She administered the Rorschach,
Thematic Apperception Test, and Make-A-Picture-Story Test...When
asked to assess which protocols were obtained from homosexuals,
the experts were unable to distinguish respondents' sexual orientation
at a level better than chance.&quot;[18]
<P>
<LI>In a 1990 article on Hooker, <I>Los Angeles Times</I> reporter
Bruce Shenitz described the experiment in precisely the same way:
 &quot;On all three tests, two-thirds of the heterosexuals and
homosexuals were assigned a rating of 3 (average) or better. 
Next, the judges were presented with pairs of tests and asked
to distinguish between heterosexuals and homosexual.  They were
able to do so no more accurately than if they were flipping a
coin.&quot;[19]
</UL></UL>
This striking agreement among scientific experts and the working
press is remarkable, especially when one realizes that all of
these accounts <I>are untrue</I>.  Marmor's version is particularly
faulty.  Indeed, the brief passage quoted above contains five
demonstrable errors of fact.
<P>
1.  &quot;The homosexuals were all rated 6 and the heterosexuals
0 on the Kinsey scale.&quot;  In the first place, in her report
Hooker makes no reference whatsoever to the Kinsey scale.  In
the second place, she gives evidence in her narrative to contradict
Marmor's generalization.  Three heterosexuals reported homosexual
contact after adolescence and three homosexuals reported heterosexual
behavior.  Kinsey described his &quot;0&quot; rating as &quot;[e]xclusively
heterosexual with no homosexual&quot; and his &quot;6&quot; rating
as &quot;[e]xclusively homosexual.&quot;
<P>
2. There were three judges involved rather than two, as Marmor
reports.
<P>
3. Dr. Marmor reports that the judges reviewed all three tests
when, in fact, two judges reviewed the Rorschach and one judge
reviewed the MAPS and TAT.
<P>
4. Dr. Marmor states that the judges reviewed the MAPS and the
TAT, as well as the Rorschach, in an attempt to distinguish between
heterosexual and homosexual subjects when, in fact, no judge was
asked to make this distinction for the MAPS and TAT because Hooker
knew the homosexuals had &quot;outed&quot; themselves.  
<P>
5. Contrary to what Marmor states, the MAPS and TAT did indeed
reveal the sexual orientation of the homosexuals.  
<P>
Both Herek and Shenitz make some of the same errors Marmor makes.
<P>
1. They suggest that more than one judge reviewed all test results.
<P>
2. They also state that after looking at the results of all three
tests, the &quot;experts&quot; or &quot;judges&quot; were unable
to distinguish between homosexual and heterosexual subjects.
<P>
Shenitz is no more than a newspaper reporter, but in <I>Morales
v. Texas</I>, Marmor and Herek were testifying as expert scientific
witnesses before a judge -- Marmor as former president of the
American Psychiatric Association.  It is ironic that while the
Morales judge accepted the testimony of Marmor and Herek without
question, he ignored the research of Paul Cameron, who gives a
careful and precise summary of the Hooker study in his volume
<I>The Gay Nineties: What the Empirical Evidence Reveals About
Homosexuality</I>.  
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CONCLUSION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
This unquestioning acceptance of &quot;authorities&quot; on the
basis of professional reputation or political correctness threatens
the integrity of our legal system.  Judges must take greater responsibility
for assessing the soundness and accuracy of testimony by so-called
experts; yet, paradoxically, such a task is manifestly beyond
the competence of the court.  This dilemma is the consequence
of the politicizing of the scientific community over the past
several decades, particularly in questions of sexuality.  The
recent exposure of Kinsey's errors indicates just how long researchers
have been careless or deliberately misleading in approaching sexual
questions.  And the widespread acclamation of recent, flawed studies
&quot;proving&quot; that homosexuality is inherited genetically
is evidence that the problem has only worsened over the years.

<P>
The 1995 federal appropriation bills which were approved by the
last Congress are filled with duplication, political favoritism,
social agendas, and questionable grants.  The alarming misuse
of taxpayer money should encourage citizens to demand more accountability.
<P>
Consider some government spending already approved for 1995:
<P>
<UL><LI> The Corporation for Public Broadcasting may pay a single individual
$438,000 for a once-a-week, 30-minute TV appearance.[1]
<P>
<LI>Federally financed Howard University gets $5.5 million to prepare
practicing attorneys to do pro bono work in Washington, DC.
<P>
<LI>NIH will spend $2.5 million to build playgrounds for monkeys.
<P>
<LI>DOT will spend $400,000 to help Russians build roads.
<P>
<LI>The Pentagon will spend $18 million for new homes at an Army
base that is losing one third of its existing personnel.
<P>
<LI>The State Department will give Russians $15 million for &quot;family
planning.&quot;
<P>
<LI>The State Department will spend $750,000 to study tropical bird
migration.
<P>
<LI>The EPA will spend $250,000 to control zebra mussels in the
City of Chicago.
<P>
<LI>The EPA will spend $70,000 to study a European fish in Lake
Superior.
<P>
<LI>HUD will spend $53 million for a sewage plant in Mexico.
<P>
<LI>The Forest Service will spend $635,000 to build a visitor center
on a remote and inaccessible by road peninsula on Alaska's panhandle.
</UL>
<CENTER><H3>DETAILS FROM 13 APPROPRIATION BILLS</h3></CENTER>
<P>
<B>1. Foreign aid in non-foreign bills</B>:  The appropriations
bill for &quot;The ForeignOperations, Export Financing, and Related Programs for the Fiscal
Year Ending September 30, 1995&quot; includes funding for most
foreign aid programs.  Foreign aid, however, can be found in other
bills.  
<P><UL>
<LI>The Federal Highway Administration was given $400,000 to provide
technical assistance to Russia.[2] 
<P>
<LI>The Department for Housing and Urban Development (HUD) was given
$52.5 million to finance the construction of a waste treatment
plant in Tijuana, Mexico.[3]  HUD is funding a second wastewater
facility near Micicali, Mexico for $47.5 million.[4] (Congress also
appropriated $1 million through the International Boundary and
Water Commission to reimburse the City of San Diego for treatment
of Tijuana sewage.[5]) 
<P>
<LI>Funding for the Smithsonian Institution includes a $50,000 grant
to the Mpala Center, Kenya for facility and equipment purchases.[6]
</UL>
<B>2. Suspect foreign aid</B>.  
<P><UL>
<LI>The State Department will provide $15 million for &quot;family
planning&quot; to Russia in 1995.[7]
<P>
<LI>It will give $50 million to the United Nation Population Fund
(UNPF) with the intention that none of this money will be used
to fund abortions in China.[8] The UNPF is expected to give $7 million
for &quot;voluntary family planning programs&quot; in China.[9]
<P>
<LI>The State Department will grant $750,000 to the Fish and Wildlife
Foundation to study neotropical migratory bird conservation.[10]
</UL>
<B>3. Duplication of programs</B>.  Our government should
look to eliminate redundancy.  Consider:
<P><UL>
<LI>The Treasury Department's plan to build a training facility
near Tuscon, Arizona.  There will be a dormitory, a dining facility
and $2.9 million in firearm ranges.[11] Just outside of Tuscon is
the Army's Fort Huachuca, which has many modern firearm ranges.
 Treasury should arrange with the Army to use existing ranges
rather than building duplicate firing facilities.  After all,
the FBI Academy's entire campus is located on Quantico Marine
Base in Virginia where it has joint use of all ranges.
<P>
<LI>The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) was appropriated
$175,000 for a special purpose grant to be given to Domestic Violence
Prevention, Inc. in Bowie County, Texas.[12] Why is housing money
used for this project when the 1994 crime bill authorizes $324
million for the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act?[13]
The crime bill also has $10 million for nonprofit organizations
to establish projects that coordinate intervention and prevention
of domestic violence, and authorizes $30 million for rural domestic
violence and child abuse enforcement.
<P>
<LI>The Department of Interior received $800,000 to monitor salmon
on Alaska's Yukon and Kuskokwim Rivers.[14] The National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) will spend another $700,000
to collect information on salmon in the Yukon River as well.[15]
NOAA collects information on salmon at other locations as well.
<P>
<LI>The Small Business Administration is directed to grant $3.25
million for three incubator facilities.[16]
<P>
<LI>The Justice Department is appropriated $29 million for &quot;Drug
Courts&quot; which is a program that provides drug treatment during
and after incarceration for non-violent offenders.[17] This replicates
ongoing programs both inside prisons and in many communities.
<P>
<LI>The National Science Foundation was appropriated $2 million
to establish in 1995 an interdisciplinary center to support research
on violence.[18] The 1994 crime bill authorizes many programs to
research violence:[19]
<P><UL>
<LI>Title IV-Violence Against Women Act of 1994 requires the Attorney
General to study campus sexual assaults, the &quot;battered women's
syndrome,&quot; the abusive spouse, and domestic violence.[20]
<P>
<LI>Title III-Crime Prevention includes research grants to investigate
juvenile violence, drug use, and gang violence.[21]
<P>
<LI>Virtually every section of the crime bill requires at least
one federal agency to either study or research special aspects
of violence.[22]
</UL><P>
<LI>HUD will award housing money for six substance abuse programs
and eight crime prevention programs.[23] The 1994 crime bill includes
duplicate grant programs.
<P>
<LI>Congress has already appropriated $20.4 million for federal
support of the 1995 Special Olympics in New Haven, Connecticut
and both the XXVI Olympiad and the X Paralympiad in Atlanta in
1996.[24] The GSA and HUD will contribute $3 million to the X Paralympiad.
 (The Paralympiad was established in 1960 to create awareness
of athletes with physical disabilities.)  The X Paralympiad will
take place in Atlanta August 16-17, just after the Olympic Games.
 Some 4,000 athletes representing 110 countries are expected to
participate.  HUD's contribution goes to assist disabled veterans
to participate.
<P>
<LI>Congress appropriated $5.6 million for the taxpayer funded District
of Columbia School of Law ignoring Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly's
recommendation to close the school.  Two of the best law schools
in the nation are in Washington, D.C. - Georgetown University
and American University and another is in nearby Baltimore.  Additionally,
the appropriation bill lists the other reasons to close the school:
it must dramatically expand its library before it can earn full
accreditation; it must increase faculty salaries and other staff
and student services; and the school needs a permanent facility
of at least 125,000 square feet.[25]
</UL>
<B>4. Spending to remember former Congressional Leaders.</B>
<P><UL>
<LI>The National Historical Publications and Records Commission
is giving $2 million to the Thomas P. &quot;Tip&quot; O'Neill,
Jr. Library at Boston College.[26] The money will be used to organize
Mr. O'Neill's personal papers.  
<P>
<LI>Two million dollars was also granted to the Robert H. and Corinne
W. Michel Congressional Education Fund.[27]  Michel was for many years
the House minority leader.  
<P>
<LI>The Merit Systems Protection Board granted $10 million to the
Morris K. Udall Scholarship and Excellence in National Environmental
Policy Foundation.[28] Udall was a liberal congressman and environmentalist
from Arizona.
</UL>
<B>5. Other questionable expenditures.</B>  
<P><UL>
<LI>The Army recently announced that the 1st Infantry Division headquartered
at Fort Riley, Kansas will be removed from the force.  This means
approximately 5,600 soldiers or a third of the post's population
will leave.  Meanwhile, Congress has appropriated $12.6 million
to build 126 new homes at Fort Riley.[29]
<P>
<LI>The 6th Infantry Division headquartered at Fort Wainwright,
Alaska was deactivated in July, 1994.  Cuts in the Army's presence
in Alaska will be felt at both Fort Wainwright and Fort Richardson
which is near Anchorage.  Yet, Congress appropriated $5 million
to build 72 new homes at Fort Richardson and $66 million to replace
the nearby and jointly used Elmendorf Air Force Base hospital.[30]
<P>
<LI>The Department of Agriculture's Forest Service will spend $635,000
to build a visitor center at Ketchikan, Alaska.  Ketchikan is
located on a remote peninsula reachable only by boat and small
plane.  Ketchikan county has a population of 14,000 inhabitants
scattered among numerous small villages.  The Department also
gave $500,000 to Alaska because &quot;many timber mills have closed.&quot;[31]
<P>
<LI>The National Institutes of Health, National Center for Research
Resources, was directed by the conference committee to reserve
$2.5 million for playgrounds for monkeys used in research.[32]
<P>
<LI>The federal government helps to fund Washington, D.C.'s Howard
University.  Part of the University's 1995 appropriations ($5.5
million) are for the creation of a Law School Clinical Center
to provide legal assistance to supplement the Legal Services Corporation
and to conduct training for practicing attorneys to perform pro
bono (free) services.[33]
</UL>
<B>6. Did you know?</B>  Here are some of the various
and sundry federal spending programs.
<P><UL>
<LI>$46 million to build and operate military child development
centers, including one in Germany and one in Great Britain.[34] These
federally subsidized centers are part of a growing network of
child care facilities that include every military activity worldwide.
<P>
<LI>$45 million will be spent by the Library of Congress for books
for blind and physically handicapped people.[35]
<P>
<LI>The Department of Transportation will give $26 million for employee
bonuses and cash awards.[36]
<P>
<LI>$2.7 million to the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation.[37]
 This 34 person organization oversees construction projects along
Washington's Pennsylvania Avenue.
<P>
<LI>$27 million annual operating expenses for the U.S. Holocaust
Memorial Council, which is a private organization that oversees
the Holocaust Museum.[38] This relatively small but popular museum
was first opened to the public two years ago.  It was built with
$168 million in private donations raised in just four years.[39]
The Council continues to receive donations from many national
and local organizations.
<P>
<LI>Child Nutrition Programs include $500,000 in state grants for
special dietary needs of children with disabilities.[40]
<P>
<LI>$7 million for the private organization American Printing House
for the Blind.[41]
<P>
<LI>The State Department oversees a $533 million United Nations
peacekeeping appropriation.  This money can be spent with one
stipulation: that American manufacturers and suppliers are given
an &quot;equal&quot; opportunity to provide equipment, services,
and materials to the United Nations peacekeepers.[42] The Senate
amended this appropriation to transfer $350 million to unspecified
&quot;International Organizations&quot; for peacekeeping activities.[43]
<P>
<LI>HUD will grant the City of Chicago $250,000 to control zebra
mussels which originally came from the Black Sea area of Europe.[44]
 The Department of Interior will continue to study zebra mussels
at St. Croix, Virgin Islands.[45] The National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration was appropriated $3.7 million to research zebra
mussels.[46] If the zebra mussel is truly endangering our oceans
and lakes, then a more focused effort should be undertaken.
</UL>
<B>7. Legislating inside appropriation bills.</B>  Five
appropriation bills contain social legislation.  
<P><UL>
<LI>The Architect of the Capitol is directed to hire a &quot;diverse
labor force.&quot;[47] This means hiring quotas.
<P>
<LI>The National Science Foundation is directed to award at least
20 percent of all grants to small colleges and universities that
consist of &quot;predominantly underrepresented groups&quot; in
science and technology.[48]
<P>
<LI>When hiring investigators the John F. Kennedy Assassination
Records Review Board is directed to give preferential treatment
to former Office of Personnel Management employees.[49]
<P>
<LI>The Office of Personnel Management is encouraged to promote
&quot;diversity.&quot;  OPM's definition of &quot;diversity&quot;
includes people of different sexual orientation.[50]
<P>
<LI>The appropriation bill for the Department of Agriculture deletes
Senate language aimed at ending the use of taxpayer funds to promote
homosexuality.[51]
<P>
<LI>Health and Human Services is directed to increase quotas for
black nurses nationally.[52]
<P>
<LI>The Federal Bureau of Investigation was appropriated funds to
restore special agents &quot;eliminated in prior years associated
with background investigations.&quot;[53] A former marker for elimination
based on a background investigation was identifying the candidate
as a homosexual.  The FBI Academy has started training for homosexuals
previously rejected.
</UL>
<B>8. Please explain these appropriations.</B>  Many programs
are funded without adequate explanation.  
<P><UL>
<LI>The Department of Education is awarding $4 million to the Mary
McLeod Bethune Memorial Fine Arts Center on the campus of Bethune
Cookman College in Daytona Beach, Florida.[54] The facility will
allow students to be trained for the fields of entertainment and
hotel management.[55]
<P>
<LI>The U.S. Institute of Peace gets $11.5 million.[56] The ten year
old institute has received $76 million in federal grants.  In
1991 it shifted from discussing peace to teaching conflict resolution
in America's classrooms.  There are more than 300 violence-prevention
programs and 100 conflict resolution curricula available to America's
28,000 high schools and 78,000 grade schools.[57] The 1994 crime
bill contains many grants for anti-violence programs.  
<P>
<LI>The Bureau of Mines is directed to do &quot;essential Arctic
research&quot; in Anchorage, Alaska.[58]  Anchorage is 400 miles south
of the Arctic Circle and has no arctic characteristics like permafrost.
 Why not conduct the research nearer the Arctic Circle, perhaps
at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks?
<P>
<LI>The National Telecommunications and Information Administration
is appropriated $1.5 million for the Pan-Pacific Educational and
Cultural Experiments by Satellite Program.[59]
<P>
<LI>Washington, D.C. received $720 million from the federal government
for public education.  The appropriation bill states, &quot;the
Board of Education has overspent its appropriation for personal
services by millions of dollars while underspending its appropriation
for other-than-personal-services by an equal amount.  The chronic
recurrence of such an imbalance suggests that the Board of Education
habitually submits budgets to the Congress that the Board knows
to be unrealistic and that the Board intends to disregard.&quot;[60]
<P>
<LI>The Department of Housing and Urban Development will award 261
special purpose grants worth $291 million.[61] These include:
<P><UL>
<LI>$450,000 to construct the Center for Political Participation
at the University of Maryland.[62] The Center &quot;is the first
academically-sanctioned program in the country to support young
leaders seeking elective office.&quot;[63] The advisory board includes
actress Morgan Fairchild, Congressman Steny Hoyer, Congresswoman
Connie Morella, <I>ABC News'</I> Sheila Kast, and the wife of
Maryland governor Parris Glendening.[64]
<P>
<LI>$500,000 to the Maine College of Art for renovations to a Portland
building.[65]
<P>
<LI>$1 million to develop the Center for Pacific Rim Studies in
San Francisco.[66] The Center will do research on competition and
offer training for professionals.  It is focused on trade development,
including foreign language and culture, legal systems, commercial
practices and data links.[67]
<P>
<LI>$6.5 million for the Points of Light Foundation.[68] The <I>Los
Angeles Times</I> found that the Foundation in its first four
years spent $22 million on administrative expenses and $4 million
on grants to service organizations.  Expenses included $1.4 million
for a kickoff celebration and more than $108,000 paid to the Hill
and Knowlton public relations firm to promote the party, as well
as a $160,000 salary for its top executive.  In the first four
years, it received $26 million from the government.[69]
<P>
<LI>$500,000 for the National Invention Resource Center in the
City of Akron, Ohio.[70] The Center is part of the nonprofit Inventure
Place which opens July, 1995.
<P>
<LI>$70,000 to study the European Ruffe in Lake Superior.[71] The
Ruffe was introduced in 1986 to Duluth Harbor which is on Lake
Superior.  The Ruffe now makes up 65 percent of the harbor's fish
population.  Why is federal housing money being used to study
the spread of this fish?  Possibly some of the $450,000 appropriated
for the Great Lakes Fishery Commission could be used to study
the Ruffe.[72]
<P>
<LI>$750,000 for a center to coordinate academic training for physical
therapists at the Veterans' Administration hospitals in Brooklyn,
NY.[73]
<P>
<LI>$2.5 million for Project Social Care MB, Inc. to serve elderly
Holocaust survivors in Brooklyn, NY.[74] There are about 2,000 Holocaust
survivors in the greater New York metro area.  Another organization,
Selfhelp Community Services, has a $51 million annual budget and
has the prime focus on helping survivors.[75]
<P>
<LI>$250,000 for port modernization at Davisville, Rhode Island.[76]
<P>
<LI>$300,000 to expand the science and mathematics complex at the
University of South Carolina.[77]
<P>
<LI>$1.2 million for the Fire Safe Cigarette Act.[78] These funds
go to the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the National
Institute of Standards and Technology to measure the cigarette's
ignition propensity.[79]
<P>
<LI>HUD special purpose grants also fund: 5 child care centers,
the restoration of 5 theaters/museums, restoring or building 5
libraries, running a summer camp program, and building a bicentennial
and media activities center for a city.[80]
</UL></UL>
<B>9. AIDS money scattered among bills.</B>  Most AIDS
money is found in the appropriations for HHS, but AIDS money is
in other bills as well.
<P><UL>
<LI>The Department of Agriculture will grant Indiana $250,000 to
study HIV/STD prevention in rural areas.[81]
<P>

<B>10. Politics and agriculture appropriations.</B>  The
1995 agriculture appropriations appear to be based more on politics
than merit.  The top three states to receive agriculture grants
earmarked by state were Arkansas, Iowa and Mississippi.[85] Arkansas
received $17.7 million, Iowa received $11.9 million, and Mississippi
received $10.45 million.
<P>
Senators from these states were on the conference committee for
appropriations.  Additionally, President Clinton is from Arkansas
and former Secretary of Agriculture Mike Epsy is from Mississippi.
<P>
The U.S. Department of Commerce reports that the highest net farm
income for 1991 came from California which ranked seventh in discretionary
agriculture grants.  Mississippi ranked 21 in net income and Arkansas
was ninth.[86] But Arkansas received almost 300 percent more discretionary
grant money than California, the highest farm income state.  Arkansas
grants included:

<LI>$462,000 for a National Center for Agricultural Law Research
and Information at the Leflar School of Law in Fayetteville, Arkansas.[87]
<P>
<LI>$1.2 million for a new agriculture building and $946,000 for
an Alternative Pest Control Center at the University of Arkansas.[88]

Taxpayers should demand that the 104th Congress review and rescind
appropriations that waste money or promote a political agenda.

<P>
Thirty years ago this March, Daniel Patrick Moynihan issued his
famous warning about the breakdown of the black family.  At the
time, liberal intellectuals and civil rights activists excoriated
him for &quot;defending middle-class values.&quot;  &quot;What
may seem to be a disease to the white middle class may be a healthy
adaptation to the Negro lower class,&quot;[1] Bayard Rustin intoned.
<P>
Today, however, overwhelming empirical evidence demonstrates that
there is nothing at all &quot;healthy&quot; about the decay of
families and that not all personal choices are equal in terms
of their impact on children, families, and communities.  The evidence
itself has propelled illegitimacy to the forefront of the current
national debate over welfare reform.
<P>
While a burgeoning white illegitimacy rate has helped strip the
debate of racial overtones, a black Democrat named Wayne Bryant
has pioneered in the state of New Jersey one of the key anti-illegitimacy
provisions recently adopted by the U.S. House.  The so-called
&quot;family cap&quot; would deny benefit increases to mothers
who bear additional illegitimate children while on welfare.
<P>
The essential purpose of the reform, according to Bryant, is to
restore healthy families.  &quot;Until the needs and the problems
of the family are confronted in a comprehensive way, welfare will
continue its course of entrapping one generation after the next
in a modern form of slavery,&quot;[2] he wrote in a paper describing
his proposal.
<P>
By incorporating the family cap, Senator Bryant intended, not
to constrict reproductive choices or to reduce births per se,
but to promote a sense of responsibility by insisting that families
on welfare live by the same values and confront exactly the same
choices as the general population.  He explained the rationale
for the cap in a series of newspaper interviews:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
These welfare reform measures are not so much about capping family
size as they are about giving recipients a chance to make choices.
 Under our conventional welfare system, 
welfare mothers are effectively shielded from confronting the
difficult questions that other American parents face when considering
additional children.... I never pretended or intended to have
the law bring about a dramatic increase in births.  It was a responsibility
issue.... Why should people on welfare be guaranteed a 'raise'
when they have additional children?  If a person wants to enlarge
their family while on welfare, they should go to work to support
the additional children like any other working family....No one
is saying welfare mothers can't have families.  We're just saying
the state won't pay for it....If the kids are suffering because
parents are irresponsible in having children they cannot afford,
they'll still suffer if we give them the money because the parents
will still be irresponsible....The battle is dissolving the wall
that separates welfare families from the mainstream population
-- and the cap is an important part of that effort.[3]
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Echoing Senator Bryant's most popular argument, California's welfare
commissioner Eloise Anderson is even more blunt: &quot;Working
women do not get automatic raises when they have children.  Why
should our expectations of a woman on AFDC be any different than
any other woman?  Do we think they're stupider or less capable
of being rational?&quot;[4] New Jersey's human services commissioner,
William Waldman, agrees: &quot;A lot of what we do [in the name
of welfare] is very patronizing.&quot;[5]
<P>
Since the family cap took effect in New Jersey in August of 1993,
the birth rate among welfare mothers in the state has dropped
substantially -- powerful proof that women on welfare are indeed
capable of governing their own decisions.  Robert Rector of the
Heritage Foundation estimates a decrease greater than 20 percent;[6]
but like Wayne Bryant, he too emphasizes that even if the birthrate
had not fallen the policy would be justified.  &quot;I support
the family cap simply because it's morally correct,&quot;[7] Rector
says.
<P>
Even the more conservative estimate of the birthrate decrease
reported by the New Jersey Department of Human Services (11.4
percent)[8] vindicates the two fundamental principles underlying
the current national debate: that economic incentives do influence
out-of-wedlock childbearing and that subsidizing irresponsible
sexual behavior has accelerated the moral and cultural decline
beyond what even Moynihan envisioned.
<P>
While Charles Murray notes that much of the force of noneconomic
social stigma was underwritten by economics in the past, he argues
that contemporary &quot;[w]elfare will not be abolished [despite
the potential economic savings to communities] until the moral
sanctions against illegitimacy have also gained great strength.&quot;[9]
 The seeming paradox highlights the difficulty of defining precisely
how government can promote character formation.
<P>
James Q. Wilson answers that &quot;[t]he essential first step
is to acknowledge that at root, in almost every area of important
public concern, we are seeking to induce persons to act virtuously&quot;[10]
-- a statement that has grown less controversial in the 30 years
since the Moynihan Report met with violent protest from moral
relativists who denied the existence of an absolute standard of
virtue.  Today, there is a mounting public consensus that bearing
children out of wedlock is wrong and that the perverse incentives
of the welfare system share much of the blame.
<P>
In a continuation of the same passage, Professor Wilson explains
the moral implications of economic incentives: &quot;Virtue is
not learned by precept...; it is learned by the regular repetition
of right actions.... Seen this way, there is no conflict between
economic thought and moral philosophy: The latter simply supplies
a fuller statement of the uses to which the former can and should
be put.  We...induce habits of right conduct...by arranging the
incentives confronting youngsters in the ordinary aspects of their
daily lives so that right action routinely occurs.&quot;[11]
<P>
Yet, morality is not merely a product of rational choices in response
to economic incentives.  If man is more than a material being,
then it is not unreasonable to expect some individual moral decisions
to override the economic incentives that run against the grain
of virtue.  Nor is it implausible to suggest that, of all the
choices an individual mother must make, the decision to abort
her child -- the most galvanizing moral issue of our day -- is
the one least likely to respond to policy variables.  
<P>
Precisely because human behavior is governed by a unique complex
of moral instinct and rational choice, the elimination of additional
cash benefits in New Jersey has decreased the birthrate without
causing an upsurge in the abortion rate.  While it is far too
premature to draw any decisive conclusions, there is absolutely
no statistical confirmation as of yet that an increase in abortions
has occurred since the New Jersey family cap took effect August
1, 1993.In fact, the total number of Medicaid-funded abortions in New Jersey
declined from 13,629 in 1993 to 13,424 in 1994.[12]
<P>
In fact, Anita Leone, executive director of an association that
represents all the publicly-funded abortion clinics in New Jersey,
asserted in a recent interview: &quot;We know that abortions in
New Jersey are currently <I>decreasing</I>.  We just don't know
why.&quot;[13] Because the decline in the birth rate among welfare
mothers in New Jersey has been rather substantial since the implementation
of the family cap, the fact that an increase in abortions is not
evident is particularly significant.
<P>
The anecdotal evidence collected by those who are on the front-lines
of welfare reform in New Jersey confirms the general pattern that
is beginning to emerge from the data.  Richard Traynor of the
Legal Center for Defense of Life in New Jersey and David Sciarra
of New Jersey Legal Services, who together filed a class-action
suit over the New Jersey family cap, both commented in telephone
interviews that the class was certified to include welfare mothers
who had aborted their babies -- but that neither one could locate
a woman who had actually aborted in the wake of the cap.
<P>
Instead, the only plaintiffs who mention abortion in their affidavits
explain that they consciously decided on moral grounds <I>not</I>
to terminate their pregnancies, despite increased economic pressures.
One woman testified that she made an appointment at an abortion
clinic but ultimately &quot;became very upset about having an
abortion and decided that [she] could not go through with it.&quot;
 Another woman who already had two children and was carrying triplets
-- three times the pressure -- never even considered abortion.[14]
<P>
Women interviewed at Chelton Terrace in New Jersey said &quot;they
didn't see the cap forcing women into abortion clinics.  'It's
not going to make them get any more abortions than what they've
been getting,' one woman said.  'If you want to have that baby,
you will.'&quot;[15] Another woman in Camden, New Jersey said that
she knew about the cap but decided to have her baby anyway.  &quot;Abortion
is against my faith,&quot;[16] she explained.
<P>
A church pastor in the same town related a telling story.  A young
welfare mother had come to the church grieving over a miscarriage.
 Another pastor gently reminded her that she really had no way
of providing for a second child and that the state would not increase
her grant.  &quot;But it just didn't make sense to her,&quot;[17]
the pastor concluded, because mothers do not tend to subject their
relationships with their children to a strict cost-benefit analysis.
 Only the most callous of mothers places a price tag on her baby's
head.
<P>
One welfare mother recently quoted in <i>The New York Times</i>
said it perhaps most eloquently: &quot;[My fourth child] wasn't
planned, but I wasn't going to abort her.  Sixty-four dollars
is not going to change my love for my child, and if I would have
aborted her, it wouldn't have comforted my soul.... You just learn
that a pound of ground beef is overrated.&quot;[18]
<P>
Michelle Scholz of the Northwest Pregnancy Center in Washington,
D.C. explains that in her experience a mother decides first whether
or not to keep her baby and, then, how to pay for the child's
care.[19] Sister Connie Driscoll, founder of St. Martin de Porres
House of Hope in Chicago, testifies that over 9,000 destitute
women have passed through her shelter in the last 12 years.  Not
one of those women has opted for an abortion.[20]
<P>
The decision to abort, the evidence suggests, is uniquely invulnerable
to rational economic incentives.  And welfare mothers are apparently
more inclined to consider &quot;non-rational&quot; factors than
any other population group.  Public opinion data collected by
the Family Research Council suggest that abortion is even more
morally repugnant to poor women;[21] and the fact that abortion rates
for teen welfare mothers are <i>lower</i> than national averages
for all teenage girls is a powerful indication that non-economic
factors determine the decision to carry a child to term.[22]
<P>
Many who now argue otherwise are precisely the ones who maintain
that the current benefits level is already far too low to cover
the costs associated with a new baby.  If so, it is illogical
to predict that a cap would have a sufficiently significant impact
on the &quot;affordability&quot; of another child to trigger such
a drastic measure as abortion.
<P>
State-by-state data from the 1980s demonstrate that small changes
in welfare payouts do not affect abortion rates in the short term;
and Michael Schwartz of Life Advocacy Alliance has found in analyzing
more recent data that states with the highest average monthly
benefit for a family of three also tend to have the highest ratio
of abortions to live births.[23]
<P>
Not surprisingly, then, the only &quot;evidence&quot; the plaintiffs
could offer in the New Jersey suit was 55 letters from pro-life
activists expressing concern that freezing benefits might increase
abortions.  As of yet, there is nothing more concrete than their
concern itself to corroborate their claims; and pro-lifers who
are unconvinced by the hearsay -- including John Tomicki, past
president of New Jersey Right to Life -- have concluded that welfare
reform itself is a pro-life cause.
<P>
The findings in New Jersey are striking evidence of the latent
moral potential in welfare mothers that is begging to be cultivated,
rather than frustrated by the perpetuation of policies that subsidize
immorality.  Remedial policies should reconcile the current tension
between moral knowledge and the economic incentives of the welfare
system -- before moral knowledge is altogether gone from the inner
city.
<P>
Charles Murray explains that, when illegitimacy reaches a critical
mass, the neighborhood effects create problems that extend far
beyond the recipients of welfare.  Community values and the norms
for male behavior are changed, and with them the behavior of young
men and women who never touch an AFDC check.  Thus, the effect
of those checks springs not only from discrete changes in economic
incentives but from a larger, more pervasive effect on the formation
of character among poor young people.[24]
<P>
Yet, conservatives must acknowledge that government cannot be
an effective moral teacher.  Public policy can undermine, but
never instill, virtue.
<P>
Rather than attempting to devise the perfect bundle of carrots
and sticks, we must eliminate altogether the government subsidies
that skew welfare recipients' decisions by shielding them from
the natural economic consequences.  Michael Tanner of the Cato
Institute writes: &quot;We could reasonably expect that people,
faced with the consequences of their actions, would change their
behavior.  Such an approach would avoid coercion and the conceit
that government knows best.&quot;[25]
<P>
Getting government out of the way, of course, is the theme that
unites social conservatives and economic libertarians.  In <i>The
Road to Serfdom</i>, F. A. Hayek emphasized the symbiotic relationship
between morality and freedom from government intervention:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Freedom to order our own conduct in the sphere where material
circumstances force a choice upon us, and responsibility for the
arrangement of our own life according to our own conscience, is
the air in which alone moral sense grows and in which moral values
are daily re-created in the free decision of the individual.[26]</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
It is the intrinsic truth of Hayek's observation that motivated
Wayne Bryant to institute the family cap in New Jersey -- a cap
he himself describes as a mechanism to reduce government constriction
of personal choices.[27]
<P>
Government must instead cede ground to the character-forming institutions
that are found in every community -- families, churches, schools,
charities, and other traditional arrangements that have been supplanted
by public authorities.  Rather than merely ending government programs,
conservatives intend to <I>replace</I> government welfare by advancing
proposals like a tax credit for charitable contributions that
will help to strengthen civil institutions.
<P>
Unless those institutions are reinvigorated and social functions
are restored to neighborhoods and communities, the behavioral
problems Daniel Patrick Moynihan described 30 years ago will only
continue to grow more acute, jeopardizing personal freedoms and
ultimately the survival of the republic itself.  If it is true
that moral values do not have concrete meaning in the absence
of freedom, it is also true that the preservation of political
liberty depends upon the cultivation 
of virtue in the people.

OF CUTTING GOVERNMENT</H2>

<P>
American families must balance expenses with income.  When this
fails, they delay clothing purchases or visits to the dentist.
  Such decisions are difficult,  but the alternative of  mounting
debt is too risky.  These hard-working taxpayers likewise expect
the federal government to keep its fiscal house in order by balancing
expenses with income.
<P>
The U.S. House of Representatives Budget Committee is beginning
the process of balancing  the national budget.  The Committee
proposes a balanced budget by the year 2002, but to get there
will require a lot of  belt tightening.   
<P>
Their proposed budget includes many needed cuts.  They propose
to terminate, privatize, or convert to block grants three Cabinet
departments, 284 programs, 69 commissions, 13 agencies, and three
commercial activities.[1]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>DEPARTMENTS TO BE ELIMINATED (3)</CENTER></H3>
<P>
The Department of Energy was created in 1977 by President Jimmy
Carter in response to the energy crisis of the early 1970s.  
The 20,213-employee agency promotes energy conservation, controls
federal supplies of power, and develops alternative sources of
energy.   However, 85 percent of DoE's budget is spent on activities
that are not energy related.[2]
<P>
The Department of Education was established in 1979 by President
Carter to expand the federal role in education.  The Department's
budget has doubled while student performance has declined.   According
to former Secretary of Education William Bennett, more than 90
percent of the students entering U.S. colleges today would not
be admitted to post-secondary education anywhere else in the world.[3]
 In fact, only a small part of federal education spending reaches
American classrooms.  Most of the Department's current functions
of technical assistance and information can be transferred to
the states or other federal agencies.
<P>
The Department of Commerce was created in 1903 and spends $3.6
billion per year on more than 100 programs of which three-fourths
are duplicated by other federal agencies.  More than half of the
Department's budget and a third of its employees staff the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.[4] This organization would
become an independent agency.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>AGENCIES TO BE ELIMINATED (3)</CENTER></H3>
<P>
Just as America's taxpayers can do without the three cabinet-level
departments targeted for elimination in the House GOP Budget,
they can surely get along without the 13 agencies the House GOP
Budget would eliminate.  For example:
<UL>
<LI>The U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration was created in
1981 and spends $17 million per year promoting tourism and recreation
activities by conducting surveys, distributing promotional material,
and running regional marketing shows.  There is no reason for
the federal government to be involved in an activity that is already
handled by a prosperous private industry.[5]
<P>
<LI>The Minority Business Development Agency was created in 1971
to promote the development of minority-owned businesses and to
steer these businesses toward government contracts.  It was appropriated
$44 million in fiscal 1996 even though it duplicates a  loan program
run by the Small Business Administration.[6] 
<P>
<LI>The Maritime Administration was created in 1950 to tap the
domestic maritime fleet in case of national emergency.  Unfortunately,
the government-owned &quot;Ready Reserve Force&quot; was not seaworthy
during the Persian Gulf call-up.   The Maritime Administration
is part of the Department of Transportation and primarily acts
as a custodian of federal subsidies used to shield U.S. vessels
from foreign competition.[7]  But most (96 percent) of all waterborne
cargo entering or leaving the U.S. is on American vessels.
</UL>
<CENTER><H3>PROGRAMS ELIMINATED (284)</CENTER></H3>
<P>
Likewise, most taxpayers aren't likely to miss the 284 programs
eliminated by the House GOP Budget.  These programs include:
<UL>
<LI>The Federal Helium Reserve and Processing Facility will cost
$26 million over the next five years.  It was established in 1925
to insure a constant supply of helium for military blimps and
observation balloons which are no longer used.  The United States
produces most of the world's helium, exporting 5.5 times as much
helium as is produced worldwide.  But the government stays in
the helium business because of a federal ban prohibiting NASA
and the Pentagon from purchasing privately produced helium.[8]
<P>
<LI>The Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation, which will
spend $2.7 million in 1995, was established in 1972 to oversee
the &quot;Avenue's revitalization.&quot;  The corporation is governed
by a 23-member board which oversees joint ventures with the private
sector, sponsors festivals, cultural performances, and athletic
events on Washington's Pennsylvania Avenue.[9]
<P>
<LI>The Points of Light Foundation in its first four years spent
$22 million on administrative expenses and $4 million on grants
to service organizations.  Expenses included $1.4 million for
a kickoff celebration and more than $108,000 paid to a public
relations firm to promote the party, as well as a $160,000 salary
for its top executive.[10]
<P>
<LI>The National Rail Passenger Corporation (AMTRAK) was created
in 1970 to take over the nation's ailing private passenger rail
service.  It has cost the taxpayer $17 billion but carries less
than one-half of one percent of America's inter-city passengers
or about 22 million passengers a year, a quarter of the entire
rail passenger service.[11]
<P>
<LI>The Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) was established
in 1968 and now sponsors more than 600 National Public Radio (NPR)
stations and 340 Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) television
stations.  PBS and NPR are primarily (80 percent) funded through
private and non-federal public donations, but the federal share
provided by CPB for fiscal year 1996  is $286 million.[12]
<P>
<LI>The Legal Services Corporation (LSC) was created in 1974 to
provide low-income individuals with legal representation. LSC
will spend part of this year's $415 million budget to fund lobbying
or campaigning for local political initiatives.  The agency, a
piggybank for left-wing causes, has fought reforms designed to
reduce out-of-wedlock births; filed suit against a nonprofit homeless
shelter; and tried to create a &quot;constitutional right&quot;
to federal welfare.[13]
<P>
<LI>The AmeriCorps program, created by President Clinton, funds
community-based organizations &quot;to address problems they identify
by using the skills of individuals serving in National Service
positions.&quot;  Participants are given a stipend, an educational
award or credit toward student loan repayment, medical benefits,
and free child care for volunteer work.  The taxpayer cost for
each &quot;volunteer&quot; exceeds $30,000 or more than $3 billion
over the next five years.[14]
<P>
<LI>The National Endowment for the Arts has been a platform for
attacks on religion, traditional art forms, traditional families
and traditional values, and a forum for the promotion of homosexuality.
 NEA grants greatly influence what is presented in museums and
theaters and what private donors feel is worthy of support.  As
former NEA Chairman John Frohnmayer noted: &quot;Our grantees
state unequivocally that fund-raising is substantially easier
because of an Endowment grant.  It is an endorsement-a mark of
quality and achievement.&quot;[15] In 1994, the private sector donated
more than $9.6 billion to the arts.
<P>
<LI>The Mary McLeod Bethune Memorial Fine Arts Center located
on the Campus of Bethune Cookman College in Daytona Beach, Florida
received a grant of $4 million from the Department of Education.
 The facility will allow students to be trained for the fields
of entertainment and hotel management, fields adequately covered
by the private sector.[16]
<P>
<LI>The Essential Air Service Program (EASP) was created in 1978
to continue air service to small communities.  EASP will spend
$28 million in 1996 subsidizing commuter service to 80 communities.
 It was initially authorized for a ten-year period.  The subsidies
that these airlines receive from taxpayers range from $5 to $320
per passenger.[17]
</UL>
<CENTER><H3>BOARDS, COMMISSIONS, AUTHORITIES TO BE ELIMINATED (269)</CENTER></H3>
<P>
Similarly, it is difficult to justify deficit spending to support
many federal boards, commissions, and authorities.  Among those
the House GOP wants to delete are:
<UL>
<LI>The Interstate Commerce Commission was created in 1887 to
oversee the rail industry.  It now oversees rail traffic, trucking,
barges, buses, freight forwarders and express companies.   Legislation
that deregulated transportation has increased competition and
made the ICC largely obsolete.[18]
<P>
<LI>The Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) was created in 1965
to fight poverty.  It is one of 62 federal economic development
programs under 18 federal departments and agencies.  ARC is currently
funded at $200 million.[19]
<P>
<LI>The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) was created in 1933 to
generate and distribute electric power for the Tennessee Valley.
 Today, TVA manages locks, dams and recreation areas, operates
a research center, and funds economic development.
</UL>
<CENTER><H3>COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES TO BE PRIVATIZED (3)</CENTER></H3>
<P>
Rather than believing worthwhile public functions must be performed
by government, the House GOP Budget plan recognizes that commercial
activities ought to be privatized.  Specifically:
<UL>
<LI>The Department of Energy operates five Power Marketing Administrations
which sell electricity from 131 dams.  In 1994, the PMA's sold
$3 billion worth of electric power.  The Budget Committee recommends
selling four of the PMA's, which are not a profitable investment
for the taxpayer.[20] 
<P>
<LI>The Naval Petroleum Reserves were established in 1912 by Presidents
William Howard Taft and Woodwork Wilson to assure fuel for the
Navy.  The project oversees two commercial oil fields and an oil-shale
reserve.  Studies show that these facilities operate far less
efficiently than comparable privately-owned fields.[21]
<P>
<LI>The United States Enrichment Corporation (USEC)  produces
and markets uranium enrichment services to private utilities in
the U.S. and abroad.  USEC advertises that it serves &quot;approximately
90 percent of the domestic market and about 40 percent of the
world market.&quot;[22] This taxpayer- financed commercial enterprise
could be sold for profit and operated more efficiently through
privatization.
</UL>
<CENTER><H3>CONCLUSION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Individually, these programmatic cuts may not amount to much;
 but collectively these changes translate into hundreds of billions
of taxpayer savings and a balanced federal budget by 2002.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>The rates in columns 2 and 3 are defined as abortions per
1,000 females on AFDC.  The twelve months prior to implementation
of the cap are August 1992 through July 1993.  The cap took effect
August of 1993, and the most recent monthly data available are
March 1994 because of a time lag in reporting.</FONT>
<P>
<HR><P>
Together with all who decry abortion, the Family Research Council
reacted with concern to press reports Tuesday that New Jersey
experienced a &quot;slight increase in the abortion rate among
women on welfare during the first eight months since implementation
of the family cap.&quot;[1]
<P>
We were relieved to discover for ourselves and are now eager
to reassure fellow pro-life advocates that the data released do
not support the conclusion that the family cap has increased abortions.
<P>
Of course, no one can ascribe causality to the family cap, no
matter how the abortion rate appears to have changed.  Officials
from the New Jersey Department of Human Services themselves stress
emphatically that &quot;additional data and analysis are required
before any link can be made between the family cap and the abortion
rate.&quot;[2]
<P>
The much more immediate problem, however, is that the numbers
just released do not describe a consistent upward trend in abortions
as the accompanying press release suggested -- and the newspapers
then hastened to report.  Instead, the raw numbers indicate that
there is no real change in the rates, other than the normal month-to-month
fluctuation that would be expected regardless of the cap.   
<P>
Jacqueline Tencza, spokeswoman for the New Jersey Department of
Human Services, herself cautioned that &quot;the department does
not believe that the [perceived] increase is statistically significant
[i.e., other than a normal distribution of values] because it
is based on a short period of time and compared with only one
previous year.&quot;[3]
<P>
Upon closer scrutiny, the alleged &quot;increase in the abortion
rate&quot; is strictly a function of the particular eight-month
time period isolated for analysis.
<P>
The abortion rate for the month of March 1994 (or March 1993)
is noticeably and significantly greater than any other rate included
in the chart, in part because the month of March contains 23 weekdays
as opposed to the average 21.7 days.  Excluding that one anomalous
rate yields a total monthly average of 9.44 for the period following
implementation of the cap -- which is virtually equal to the pre-cap
average monthly abortion rate of 9.43.
<P>
Examining the pre-cap and post-cap numbers month by month helps
underscore the fact that a straightforward comparison of the two
8-month averages listed in the chart is meaningless.  Three of
the eight months before implementation of the cap in fact posted
a higher abortion rate than the corresponding months in the year
after the cap took effect.
<P>
The waters grow considerably murkier, moreover, when calculations
of average monthly abortion rates include the rates for the four
pre-implementation months in 1993 not included in the chart released
Tuesday.  When the rates for these months (10.96 in April 1993;
9.33 in May 1993; 10.9 in June 1993; and 10.34 in July 1993)[4] are
included, the average monthly abortion rate for the entire year
before implementation of the cap is 9.75 -- again, virtually equal
to the average rate for the eight months since the cap (the only
post-cap months for which data are currently available).  It is
possible, in fact, to isolate a different eight-month period prior
to the cap for which the average monthly abortion rate is higher
than the average calculated for the eight months post-cap.[5]
<P>
It would, of course, be foolish to jump to the conclusion that
abortions must have declined in New Jersey since implementation
of the cap -- but no more foolish than it is to conclude that
abortions have definitely increased in New Jersey, based on the
comparison of two 8-month averages.  It is worthwhile to note
in passing that to date the numbers do not exclude the possibility
that abortions have declined slightly since the cap took effect.
<P>
Given what limited data we have, however, it appears most probable
that the New Jersey family cap is essentially abortion-neutral.
 And we can assert with a large measure of confidence that the
fears of a large upsurge in the short-term abortion rate are unfounded.
<P>
But we repeat again, as we have carefully stated in all previous
comments on the family cap:  It is far too premature to draw any
decisive conclusions from the welfare reform experiment in New
Jersey.  Indeed, it would be a travesty for the national debate
over an issue as critical as welfare reform to rise or fall on
the basis of preliminary returns from one state.
<P>
New Jersey, of course, is a worst-case scenario for the family
cap because it is one of the few states that provides public funding
for abortion.  Failure to demonstrate a consistent, upward trend
in the abortion rate in New Jersey in particular confirms that
it is perfectly appropriate for the debate over the family cap
to go forward.  Given the pathologies of our current welfare system,
the debate <I>must</I> go forward.
<P>
Even with the release of the most recent data, there is still
every reason to theorize that the family cap may be functioning
as a new safeguard for the lives of the unborn.  To know whether
the net effect of the family cap is an increase or a decrease
in the abortion rate, we must know the number of abortions performed
on women who have left the state's welfare rolls.  If the cap
encouraged them to become self-sufficient or to seek alternative
means of support for their babies -- as the framers of the policy
intended -- the abortion rate for former welfare mothers may very
well have decreased.  And the total number of abortions in New
Jersey may have declined.  If that proves to be the case, in a
state that provides public funding for abortions, we will have
powerful evidence to predict that the family cap will be actively
anti-abortion in a state that does not fund or otherwise encourage
abortion.    
<P>
Family Research Council, however,  has never maintained that the
legitimacy of the family cap depends on its capacity to reduce
abortions over the short-term.  The current welfare system is
indelibly anti-marital and anti-natal -- peacefully coexisting
with the world's highest abortion rates outside the Eastern Bloc.
 Long-term change may entail some risk of short-term harm, but
the cost of reform must be weighed against the moral cost of perpetuating
a system that destroys the lives of both the born and yet unborn.
<P>
The family cap is the only welfare reform initiative in the Senate
debate that will directly reduce out-of-wedlock pregnancy, which
is strongly correlated with abortion.  Ardent support for the
family cap <I>is</I> the pro-life position because marriage is
the best protection for children both before and after birth.
 Paying women not to have abortions, by contrast, is morally corrupt.

<P>
A study of fruit flies by National Institutes of Health scientists
has rekindled the debate over whether homosexuality has a genetic
component. 
<P>
A set of male fruit flies, the study reports, formed mating chains
with each other after their body chemistry was altered.  But a
close look at the study reveals that the most reasonable conclusions
from the evidence are that male and female sex drives are quite
different, and that frenzied males, under certain conditions,
will mate with anything, even other males. 
<P>
Writing in the June 1995 <I>Proceedings of the National Academy
of Sciences</I>, Shang-Ding Zhang and Ward F. Odenwald of the
National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke division
of the National Institutes of Health report a heightening of the
sexual activities of fruit flies that had been heat-treated to
reduce levels of the chemical serotonin.[1] Reduction of serotonin
has been linked in other studies to an increase in sexual activity
and same-sex coupling among some animals (rats, cats, and rabbits).[2]

<P>
Media reports, predictably, have exaggerated the actual findings
of the research.  <I>Time,</I> for instance, reported that the
new study &quot;adds to the mounting evidence that homosexuality
has genetic origins....&quot;[3]
<P>
The <I>Time</I> article and other media reports ignore or underreport
key elements of the study that work against the claim that homosexuality
may be hereditary or even partly hereditary.  One finding was
that altered females, the study notes, were not affected in any
discernible way.  
<P>
Another finding -- that normal males resisted sexual advances
by the altered males for up to two hours and then succumbed to
same-sex activity -- indicates strongly that homosexual behavior
is environmentally induced. 
<P>
From the study:
<P>
&quot;At the beginning of chaining periods, in bottles containing
[more than] 80 percent transformants [treated flies], nontransformant
males were observed only at 
the head of fast moving chains where they repeatedly displayed
repelling signals to advancing suitors -- i.e. wing-flicking,
face-kicking, and/or running away....After a 2-hr. exposure to
vigorous transformant courtship, many, if not all, of the nontransformants
were observed courting and inducing courtship.&quot;[4]
<P>
In bottles in which females were present, the females formed defensive
clusters, impeding males' efforts to mate with them.  In one jar
pictured in the article, the females were huddled at the very
bottom while the males formed long lines of sexual activity in
the rest of the jar.  Some of the males did mate with the females,
but the females offered resistance.  
<P>
As the study explains: 
<P>
&quot;Lead males would typically break off their heterosexual
advances after experiencing one or more of her repelling signals...such
as kicking his face and/or running or flying away.  During vigorous
chaining periods, females predominantly grouped together in tight
clusters; however, no female-female courtship was observed in
or outside of these dense packs.&quot;[5]
<P>
The male &quot;homosexual&quot; activity might have had little
to do with preference and merely involve frenzied mating with
the nearest available partner.
<P>
But listen to how <I>Time</I> magazine summarizes the participation
by the &quot;straight&quot; males:
<P>
&quot;While the gays formed their conga lines, the straights stayed
to the side -- but only temporarily.  After a few hours, the straights
joined in and, for the time being, acted gay.&quot;[6]
<P>
No mention is made by <I>Time</I> of the struggle by the &quot;straight&quot;
flies to ward off the hypersexual males.  And the use of the word
&quot;gay&quot; to describe the flies gives them anthropomorphic
overtones; that is, the writer attributes human characteristics
to a non-human rather than vice-versa.  But the notion of being
&quot;gay&quot; is a calculated construct of self-identification
for political purposes.  Many people struggling with homosexuality
reject the idea that their defining characteristic is to be &quot;gay.&quot;[7]
 The <I>Time</I> article does concede that &quot;[t]he type of
gene they've been studying in fruit flies could not begin to account
for the complex variations in human homosexual behavior.  For
one thing, the gene does not cause flies to renounce heterosexuality
altogether.  If a 'gay' fly is surrounded by females instead of
males, he'll fertilize the lady flies.&quot;[8]
<P>
Another culturally significant fact from the study is that when
non-treated male flies constituted 50 percent or more of the population
in a bottle, the researchers found that &quot;little or no chaining
was detected and nontransformant participation was rarely observed.&quot;[9]
<P>
In other words, when the bottle's &quot;culture&quot; was at least
half normal, the male-to-male sex occurred not at all or rarely.
 But when the normal flies were surrounded by &quot;homosexual&quot;
flies and attacked repeatedly, they finally gave in to the behavior.
 Again, it is perilous to extrapolate insect studies to humans,
but this sounds much like experiences reported among convicts.
 Otherwise sexually normal prison inmates sometimes indulge in
homosexual behavior, not because of genetics but because of the
immediate environment (coercion, lack of opposite-sex partners,
peer acceptance of the behavior).  According to psychiatrist and
author Jeffrey B. Satinover, &quot;It is common knowledge that
when some heterosexual men are placed in isolation for long periods
of time with each other that they will engage in homosexual behavior.
 But, once released, they will resume their heterosexual behavior.&quot;[10]
<P>
The social sciences are increasingly looking to animals or insects
for clues to human behavior, even though human sexuality is quite
different.  But if any lessons are to be drawn for human purposes,
they might be these:
<P>
<LI>  The sexes are quite different in their sexual needs, drives
and reactions to particular stimulants.
<P>
<LI>  A culture that hopes to maintain its sexual norms is at risk
when a critical mass of deviant behavior occurs.
<P>
 <LI> Homosexual behavior is learned, and occurs among those who are
vulnerable to the environmental factors that tend to produce homosexual
behavior. 
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CONCLUSION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
As with other studies purporting to show a genetic link to homosexuality,
the NIH study is being hailed by homosexual activists, who are
trying to equate homosexuality with an immutable characteristic
such as skin color or ethnic origin in their drive to create support
for an entirely new category of behavior-based special civil rights.
<P>
The actual research often reveals something entirely different
from what is claimed.  Researchers Zhang and Odenwald summarize
that &quot;both genetic and environmental factors play a role
in male sexual behavior[11]....elements of the basic machinery controlling
male sexual behavior may be highly conserved between taxonomically
distinct organisms.&quot;[12] They call for more research on the
topic to &quot;enhance our knowledge of the underlying mechanisms
controlling sexual behavior.&quot;[13]
<P>
The study is interesting.  But it gives no hard evidence of anything
other than the fact that male fruit flies subjected to a sexual
stimulant may mate with anything in sight.  In March 1993, two
Columbia University psychiatrists examined the various studies
purporting to find a homosexual biologic component.   They concluded
that &quot;there is no evidence at present to substantiate a biologic
theory...the appeal of current biologic explanations for sexual
orientation may derive more from dissatisfaction with the present
status of psychosocial explanations than from a substantiating
body of experimental data.&quot;[14]
<P>
In other words, politics, not science, is driving the debate.
 An honest look at the evidence of 70 years of psychology, therapeutic
research, the history of the entire human race, and the moral
codes of all the great civilizations tells us that homosexuality
is not only universally discouraged as learned behavior but can
also be temporary, controlled, or even changed.
<P>
Given the well-documented, socially and medically destructive
effects of homosexual behavior on individuals, families and communities,
compassion and prudence should lead us to discourage any cultural
promotion of homosexuality as a moral and normal activity.  Media
reports indicate that homosexual experimentation among high schoolers
has increased considerably in recent years as schools have presented
homosexual activity as normal, desirable and even &quot;cool.&quot;[15]
 Sexually vulnerable young people are being steered onto a behavioral
path that they and their families will sorely regret and which
will even cost some of them their lives at an early age.
<P>
Homosexual behavior, like other destructive vices, can be learned
-- and unlearned.  Under no circumstances should it be promoted,
particularly through misrepresentation of scientific studies.

<P>
<P>
Federal arts funding, much like the welfare system, has created
a class of beneficiaries who are hostile to conservative, pro-family
causes.  Recipients of federal aid all too often become cheerleaders
for big government, the family's natural enemy.  Big government
strips families of their incomes through confiscatory taxation
and diminishes their autonomy through intrusive social welfare
and educational programs designed to wean children from their
parents (and parental values) at earlier and earlier ages. 
<P>
The same taxpayers who suffer the indignity of seeing their own
earnings used by bureaucrats to undermine their families also
pay for a federally-subsidized artistic and media elite to cheer
on their tormentors: the Corporation for Public Broadcasting,
the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment
for the Humanities.
<P>
It is long past time that the federal arts and humanities endowments
be de-authorized and de-funded.  Spawned during the 1960s' Great
Society years, these agencies, despite whatever good they have
done, have damaged American culture, ripped off the taxpayer,
waged war on the family and religion, and politicized the academy
and the arts.   
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CURRENT PROPOSALS TO TRIM THE ENDOWMENTS ARE ILL-ADVISED AND
COUNTER-PRODUCTIVE.</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Merely cutting the budgets and stretching out the life of the
agencies will cause more mischief.  When Proposition 13 was enacted
into law in California, hostile government officials began cutting
back on essentials, such as police and fire departments, leaving
the waste and fat untouched.  The object lesson to the voters
was that challenging government growth meant the onset of anarchy.
 Similarly, if the federal budgets for public broadcasting and
the arts and humanities are merely reduced, the truly offensive
offerings will be the last to be de-funded.  Vengeful bureaucrats
will trim where it will cause the most pain and where patrons
would complain most loudly.  A couple of years ago, when Congress
stalled in passing an appropriations bill for the federal government,
the Smithsonian closed its 
doors, as did some national parklands, enraging taxpaying visitors.
 But the long-obsolete federal Helium Reserve suffered no loss
of gas.  Again, the message to the voters was:  we will punish
you if you don't lobby your elected representatives to reinstate
our funding -- with increases. 
<P>
<CENTER><H3>SOME POLITICIANS THINK THEY CAN BUY PEACE BY APPEASING THEIR
OPPONENT. INSTEAD, THEY CREATE A HARDENED ENEMY.</H3></CENTER>
<P>
In terms of the federal endowments, the political price is actually
higher for merely cutting instead of eliminating them.  Recipients
of federal aid are the natural foes of budget cutters and will
continue to use their taxpayer-provided subsidies to wage political
war on them.  Hundreds of arts organizations are being lobbied
to bring pressure on individual members of Congress to preserve
art pork in their own districts.
<P>
A case in point is a letter from Independent Television Service
Executive Director James Yee to public broadcasting advocates.
 The taxpayer-supported (and, therefore, in no way independent)
ITVS was created in 1988 to provide new programming for public
broadcasting.  Yee urges his &quot;independent colleagues&quot;
to &quot;become involved in future efforts to drum up support
for public broadcasting, especially with your local and national
elected officials....&quot;  Yee warns that &quot;an extensive
informational outreach campaign will have to be waged.&quot; 
Such campaigns cost money, but are easier to mount when federal
subsidies pour in to handle other costs.  
<P>
The current House plan to phase out the endowments serves only
to give welfare artists some time to restore their subsidies.
 Indeed, subsidy supporters have acknowledged, through their accord,
that the phase-out plan is their best hope for saving the agencies
and returning to business as usual.[1] 
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CUTTING BACK THE ENDOWMENTS WILL NOT LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT REFORM.</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Congress repeatedly has slapped NEA on the wrist, and still the
NEA sends money to The Kitchen, Franklin Furnace and other centers
of blatantly offensive &quot;performance&quot; art that denigrates
religion, families and traditional morality.  Indeed, a <I>Washington
Post</I> critic observed recently that the 1993 Biennial Exhibition
at the NEA-funded Whitney Museum was &quot;one long whinging [sic]
whine of political correctness, suggesting as it did that the
only art that counts is art produced by lesbians, inhabitants
of barrios, sufferers of AIDS and others on the margin.&quot;
 Two years later, at the 1995 Biennial, &quot;[h]omosexuality's
still hot, especially the kinds involving punctures of the flesh,
accessories of leather, bondage and cross-dressing, but so too
are the subtlest of painterly abstraction.  Nuances and nipple-rings
are both themes of this exhibit, if it can be said to have any
themes at all.&quot;[2]
<P>
NEA chairwoman Jane Alexander has boasted of using the endowment
to promote homosexual themes[3] and has even defended a public bloodletting
by an HIV-infected  performer at an NEA-subsidized venue.[4]  Despite
many assurances by past and present NEA officials that excellence
and artistic merit are the criteria for grant allocation, this
is clearly not the case.  More than $9 billion in private giving
sustains arts in communities all over America.[5] The NEA's $175
million is important more for its symbolism than for the actual
dollars involved.  An NEA grant validates an artist, and the government
should not be putting its imprimatur on much of the anti-family,
anti-religious propaganda that counter-culture activists brazenly
categorize as art.  The entertainment industry has revenues in
the tens of billions of dollars  each year.  Time-Warner alone
took in $15.9 billion during 1994.  Clearly, Hollywood is in a
better position to subsidize the endowments for arts and humanities
than US taxpayers who struggling to get out from under $200 billion
in annual deficits.
<P>
<CENTER><H3> CORPORATION FOR PUBLIC BROADCASTING</H3></CENTER>
<P>
In 1967, President Lyndon Johnson signed the Public Broadcasting
Act creating CPB.  The agency oversees the Public Broadcasting
Service, which was formed in 1969, a year before the creation
of National Public Radio.  CPB's total appropriation in fiscal
1969 was $5 million.  In 1992, Congress re-authorized CPB with
a three-year, $1.1 billion appropriation.  By 1993, CPB's annual
federal appropriation was $318.6 million, which rose to $386 million
for fiscal 1995.  There are 349 public TV stations and 200 TV
grantees receiving CPB funding.[6]  PBS claims to reach 1.8 million
teachers and 29.5 million students through educational programming
and services, and 97 million Americans overall each week with
some PBS programming.[7] National Public Radio is carried on 595
stations, and CPB awards money to 391 public radio grantees. 
<P>
The basis for CPB's existence has always been an anti-free market
philosophy.   Proponents have said that the market is incapable
of providing good programming, so the government must step in
and do it, to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars annually.[8]
 Yet the shows that register high ratings on PBS turn out to be
the very programs that the public perceives to be excellent: <I>Sesame
Street</I>, <I>Barney and Friends</I>, <I>The MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour</I>,
and <I>Masterpiece Theatre</I>, for example.  All of these shows
are generating more than sufficient revenue from sponsors, donors,
grants and product marketing.  They do not need taxpayer subsidies.
<P>
But there is other CPB programming that probably would fail to
attract a sufficient viewing/listening audience or donor support.
 These programs are so bad that their creators must dig into the
public purse.  Subsidizing bad art is a donor's prerogative, of
course -- unless the &quot;donor&quot; is the taxpayer, who has
no choice.  (For detailed examples, see FRC's Policy paper entitled
&quot;Public Broadcasting?  Let's Free Big Bird.&quot;)
<P>
<CENTER><H3> NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE ARTS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
NEA was established in 1965 when President Johnson signed the
National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities Act, which also
created the National Endowment for the Humanities.  NEA's initial
budget was $2.5 million, but grew over the years to about $175
million annually (fiscal 1995 appropriation is $167.7 million).
 A fiscal 1995 rescission bill, HR 1158, would reduce 1995 funding
to $162.5 million.[9] All told, NEA has spent more than $3 billion
of tax money in its 30-year history.   
<P>
The plan approved by the House Economic and Educational Opportunities
Committee on May 10, 1995 would reauthorize NEA through fiscal
1998 but eliminate funding in fiscal 1999.  Funding would be reduced
by 40 percent in fiscal 1996, another 40 percent in fiscal 1997
and by 20 percent in fiscal 1998. The NEA would get no money in
fiscal 1999.[10]
<P>
NEA would also face a $5 million cap on administrative expenses,
which would entail an 80 percent reduction in budget for staff.
 Currently, NEA spends $24 million annually on administration.[11]
<P>
Beginning in 1996, grants to individuals would be eliminated,
with all grants going to institutions.  Eighty percent of annual
appropriations to the state art councils would be in the form
of block grants.[12]
<P>
A Senate bill (S 856) introduced by James Jeffords (R-VT) and
co-sponsored by Nancy Kassebaum (R-KS), Alan Simpson (R-WY), Edward
Kennedy (D-MA) and Claiborne Pell (D-RI) would reauthorize NEA
for five years (FY 1996-2000) at gradually reduced funding levels.
 Forty percent of the NEA's program budget would go to &quot;partnership&quot;
grants with the states, local and regional groups; 40% more would
go toward organizations of &quot;national significance;&quot;
a final 20% would go to direct grants to organizations, such as
theaters or museums, and to individual artists. 
<P>
Most significantly, the bill keeps intact much of the current
peer review system, in which panelists award federal tax dollars
to their friends and associates.  It also locks in place the conditions
under which the NEA would reject a grant over &quot;obscenity.&quot;
 An artwork would have to be found legally obscene in a court
of law before the NEA could move to recover funds.  Given that
a grant from the NEA automatically gives an artwork &quot;artistic&quot;
significance no matter how offensive, the provision is meaningless
in terms of curbing abuses of taxpayer funding.  
<P>
The bill also directs the current NEA director to give &quot;Distinguished
Lifetime Service for the Arts&quot; awards to &quot;each of the
former Chairpersons of the Endowment.&quot;  This means that federal
taxpayers would honor, among others, John Frohnmayer, the NEA
chief whose tenure ended when he was forced by President Bush
to resign over NEA's continued funding of anti-Christian and pornographic
works. 
<P>
Finally, the bill creates an entirely new federal agency to nationalize
standards for all public libraries and museums.  The &quot;Institute
for Museum and Library Services&quot; would be authorized for
five years, beginning with a budget of $75 million in fiscal 1996
&quot;and such sums as may be necessary for each of the 4 succeeding
fiscal years,&quot; and would have grant-making authority.  This
is a potentially lucrative source to be abused by well-connected
left-wing groups like the American Library Association, would
give the federal government potential control over the nation's
local public libraries, and would do to libraries and museums
what the NEA has done to art -- redefine it using federal tax
dollars to further a radical cultural and political agenda. 
<P>
<CENTER><H3>NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE HUMANITIES</H3></CENTER>
<P>
NEH was established at the same time NEA was born, in 1965.  The
fiscal year 1966 budget was $5.9 million, and the agency had a
staff of 13.[13] The agency expanded over the years until it reached
a budget of $177 million in fiscal 1995.  
<P>
Officials at the NEH are hardly contrite for sponsoring a widely-denounced
set of national history standards that, among other things, emphasize
the role of the Ku Klux Klan (17 references) and exalt Soviet
advances in space while ignoring Albert Einstein, the Wright Brothers,
Paul Revere, Robert E. Lee and the American moon landing.[14] The
NEH also specializes in promoting cultural relativism, feminist
studies and other Marxist and neo-Marxist theoretical quagmires
on the nation's campuses.[15]
<P>
The current plan approved by the House Economic and Educational
Opportunities Committee would reauthorize NEH with an annual 20
percent funding reduction through fiscal 1998 starting with the
1995 appropriation of $172 million (which includes a recent House-approved
$5 million rescission).  No funding would be allocated to NEH
in 1999.  The 5 percent cap for administrative expenses would
also apply to NEH, as well as the termination of direct federal
grants to individuals (scholars would continue to receive grants
through recipient organizations such as universities).  Eighty
percent of appropriations would go to state humanities councils
in the form of block grants.  Senate bill S 856 would reauthorize
NEH for five years at gradually reduced funding levels, beginning
with $168.6 million in fiscal year 1996.  Each state would get
a minimum of $200,000 in funding each fiscal year.  Grants would
continue to be made to &quot;groups, individuals, and State agencies
or entities.&quot;  
<P>
<CENTER><H3>SUMMARY</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Attempts to curry favor with the welfare broadcast media and arts
groups are useless and only embolden the political enemies of
budget cutters.  So, we must ask budget-cutting Members of Congress:
why give the very people who will never love you enough subsidies
to stay in business so they can continue taking shots at you?
 The federal arts subsidies must end once and for all.

<h2>GLOBALONEY, FAMILY STYLE:<br>
THE UNITED NATIONS WORLD SUMMIT FOR<br>
SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT TAKES ON THE FAMILY</h2>
<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>
What follows is a commentary on the &quot;Draft Declaration and
Draft Programme of Action&quot; prepared by United Nations staff
for the &quot;World Summit for Social Development&quot; scheduled to
occur in Copenhagen March 6-12, 1995.  This commentary is indicative
of problems found in the document, which runs some 55 pages in
typescript, and which addresses, in generally broad language,
a wide range of social issues and concerns in member countries
of the United Nations.  This commentary will be updated after
Copenhagen to discuss the final language of the Declaration and
Programme of Action.    
<P>
<center><h3>INTRODUCTION</h3></center>
<P>
Following the United Nations and its swamp of commissions, declarations,
and conferences can be a debilitating experience.  The situation
is compounded by the rapidly growing basket of UN documents and
observances devoted to such topics as the family (International
Year of the Family, 1994), population and development (International
Conference on Population and Development, 1994), social development
(World Summit for Social Development, 1995), and women (Fourth
World Conference on Women, 1995).    
<P>
Thematically and administratively separate, these observances
and conferences tend to overlap in subject matter.  This is due
in part to the ambiguity of mission in many UN agencies and documents,
and the tendency of recent UN meetings to produce &quot;smorgasbord&quot;
documents that say in 1,000 words what more succinct documents
(like those of the American founding) say in 10.  Thus, for example,
the bitter dispute over abortion at the ICPD in Cairo in 1994
is likely to be reprised at the Beijing women's conference and
its preliminary meetings.              
<P>
An additional factor promoting these disputes is the continued
presence and agitation within the UN structure of international
lobbies (some with economic ties to the UN, and others privately
funded) devoted to particular agendas.  The United Nations Charter
(for example, Chapter X, Article 71, relating to the Economic
and  Social Council) makes specific provision for consultation
by the UN and its constituent councils and agencies &quot;with
nongovernmental organizations [NGOs] which are concerned with
matters within its competence.&quot;  
<P>
The Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) is responsible for conducting
all events in connection with the World Summit for Social Development.
<P>
NGOs vary in the amount and type of energy they devote to UN activities.
 Essentially, they  are private, charitable (i.e., tax exempt)
or advocacy organizations that are accredited by the UN  to lobby
at particular conferences and the preparatory meetings leading
up to them.  In the context of Cairo and Beijing, NGOs such as
the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF)  and the
Women's Environmental and Developmental Organization (WEDO) have
exerted continuous pressure, with considerable internal UN support,
for the drafting of documents that  strongly endorse abortion,
the redefinition of the family, and other radical causes.    
<P>
Preparatory meetings leading up to designated international conferences
are called, in UN lingo, &quot;prepcoms.&quot;  Major prepcoms
for both the Cairo population conference and the Beijing women's
summit have been held months in advance at the United Nations
headquarters in New York.  The prepcoms are run by &quot;Preparatory
Committees,&quot; composed of representatives of member nations
of the UN.  In between sessions of the prepcom, the Committee
chairman, with  the assistance of the UN Secretariat, may be tasked
with such responsibilities as the drafting of  declarations and
programmes of action.  The periods between prepcoms are invaluable,
especially to New Yorkbased NGOs, as opportunities to lobby UN
officials and to influence the development of conference documents.
<P>
With respect to the World Summit for Social Development, a second
session of the prepcom  was held in New York from August 22 to
September 2, 1994.  At that session, the committee  tasked its
chairman to prepare a declaration for consideration in Copenhagen.
 The UN Secretariat was charged by the committee to prepare a
programme of action for Copenhagen.  The analysis that follows
discusses the draft declaration and programme of action of November
22, 1994, as prepared by the chairman and the Secretariat.  As
of this writing, a final draft is in the process of  being completed
for submission to the summit in Copenhagen.    
<P>
That the United Nations is an incessant document mill has become
increasingly obvious.  The  November 22 draft, as discussed below,
incorporates a wealth of vague and contradictory ideas,  not the
least of which is the situational irony of a massive United Nations
bureaucracy proclaiming itself the savior of decentralized government.
 But, the question may be asked, are not most UN documents merely
recommendations, without the force of law?  Indeed, the design
of the  Economic and Social Council announced in the UN Charter
is precisely that of a body constituted to hold meetings and make
recommendations.  Article 62 defines the powers of ECOSOC as 
follows:                 
<P>
1.  The Economic and Social Council may make or initiate studies
and reports with respect to international economic, social, cultural,
educational, health, and related matters and may make recommendations
with respect to any such matters to the General Assembly, to the
Members of the United Nations, and to the specialized (UN) agencies
concerned.                  
<P>
2.  [ECOSOC] may make recommendations for the purpose of promoting
respect for, and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms
for all.                  
<P>
3.  [ECOSOC] may prepare draft conventions for submission to the
General Assembly ...      
<P>
4.  [ECOSOC] may call, in accordance with rules prescribed by
the United Nations, international conferences on matters falling
within its competence.  This brief Article summarizes the activity
of the ECOSOC with respect to the World Summit  for Social Development
 with one exception.  That is, none of the documents of the Summit
 amount to a convention, a legal instrument that requires the
approval of the General Assembly  and the submission to members
states for ratification.  Examples of such conventions are the
Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention for the
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.  It
is important to realize that the language developed at Copenhagen
for its nonbinding declaration and programme of action will thereby
acquire momentum within the UN system, and perhaps form the basis
for future conventions with potentially legally binding force.
<P>
<center><h3>WEDO AND THE GLEN COVE CONCLAVE</h3></center>
<P>
It is this possibility that motivates the activities of the most
intensely involved NGOs, such as  the Women's Environmental and
Development Organization (WEDO).  Former Democratic Congresswoman
Bella Abzug, a privatecitizen member of the US delegation to the
Cairo population conference, is the leader of WEDO.  An uncompromising
feminist and abortion advocate, Abzug  represented WEDO at a November
29 to December 2, 1994 planning meeting for the Beijing women's
conference.  This global strategy meeting was held in Glen Cove,
New York.  While  focused primarily on Beijing, the meeting included
working groups focused on devising strategies and language for
the whole basket of UN conferences and documents in progress.
 In that context, many of its recommendations are instructive.
<P>
The Glen Cove working group on the Copenhagen document criticized
it for its focus &quot;on the  family as the basic unit&quot;
of society, and for overlooking &quot;the changing configuration
of the  family.&quot;  The working group called for women's housework
to be remunerated, for a &quot;universal  adequate annual guaranteed
income,&quot; and &quot;payment for childcare.&quot;  It also
called for the adoption of a tax on &quot;international financial
transactions&quot; and &quot;taxation of transnational corporations&quot;
to  finance social development, presumably under UN auspices.
 (In this regard, the November 22 Copenhagen draft recommends
that the General Assembly task the ECOSOC to study such  proposals.)
<P>
The working group proposed a number of changes to the Copenhagen
draft (See full text of  the November 22 draft in the Appendix).
 The changes include a subtle call for changes in electoral systems
to establish a &quot;mechanism for women's ... equitable representation
at all levels of  the political process.&quot;  Other language
developed at Glen Cove suggests this &quot;mechanism&quot; would
 include gender quotas for public office.  In addition, the working
group proposed that the  Copenhagen document ensure &quot;that
effective laws and agencies exist to prevent and eliminate  discrimination
on the basis of gender [and] sexual orientation ...&quot;; &quot;that
women and adolescents  have access to good quality, comprehensive
health care, including the full range of reproductive  and sexual
health care services, including access to safe abortion ...&quot;;
and that the draft's  language regarding &quot;family as the basic
unit of society&quot; be replaced with references to &quot;households
and families&quot; as &quot;important economic units.&quot;  
<P>
The Glen Cove working group recommendations for Beijing are also
revealing.  The group  called for the &quot;recognition of sexual
orientation as a fundamental human right within the context  of
the expanding definition of the family.&quot;  It also called
for &quot;sexual and reproductive education to [sic] boys and
girls&quot;; affirmative action to assure that &quot;governments
... achieve 50% representation in elected and appointed office
by women by the year 2005,&quot; to be achieved by &quot;setting
 targets or quota systems&quot;; and encouraging &quot;activities
aimed at changing traditional decisionmaking roles in the family.&quot;
 One specific action recommended by the working group is that
the UN Secretariat prepare a &quot;gender balance rating card&quot;
to be published at the beginning of each session of the General
Assembly &quot;rating and ranking Member States on the basis of
numbers, positions, titles, race and ethnicity of women participating
in their Missions to [the] UN ...&quot;      
<P>
Other working groups dealt with the aftermath of the Cairo population
conference and discussed ways to expand the advances made in promoting
the notion of &quot;reproductive health and  decisionmaking&quot;
as aspects of fundamental human rights, including possibly adolescents
and  single people.  The goal remains to assure that abortion
is included in future UN documents &quot;as a  basic method of
fertility regulation and as an essential part of reproductive
health services and  rights.&quot;    
<P>
Finally, Working Group 2 at Glen Cove developed a program of lobbying
and other activities  to be undertaken between the Copenhagen
and Beijing meetings.  The program is entitled the  &quot;Women's
Global Campaign, 180 Days, 180 Ways.&quot;  The campaign's goal
is to extend the statements of belief and programs of action of
the Glen Cove coalition to a wider network of women,  NGOs and
&quot;disenfranchised people.&quot;  Expanded usage of online
computer networks is  envisioned.  All of this is in keeping with
a recognition that the topdown organization of social  movements
by such bodies as the United Nations are doomed to failure if
it cannot enlist the  support of a grassroots movement in member
nations.                                      
<P>
The Glen Cove conclave amounted to a gathering of radical feminists
rebuffed politically in the  United States but rewarded in the
closed environment of New York and the United Nations,  funded
and supported by a variety of such populist funding sources as
the Ford, and Rockefeller  Foundations, and abetted by the swelling
throng of UN and Clinton Administration bureaucrats  dedicated
to adopting the sexual revolution on a global scale.  With each
new UN conference and  document, they have another opportunity
to move the international clock in the direction of their  Brave
New World.    
<P>
<center><h3>ANALYSIS OF NOVEMBER 22 COPENHAGEN DRAFT</h3></center>
<P>
All page numbers refer to the November 22, 1994 draft declaration
and &quot;programme of  action.&quot;  The actual text of the
draft declaration reviewed begins on page 3 and concludes at page
 55.  Most paragraphs in the declaration are identifiable by numbers
or letter designations in the  text, and these designations are
used in this commentary.  Language that is objectionable is  indicated
by brackets [ ].  Language to be added or substituted for objectionable
language is indicated in bold.    
<P>
Suggested modifications follow.    
<P>
Page 3, paragraph 2.  Modify line two to read &quot;profound social
problems specially poverty,  unemployment, family breakup and
social exclusion.&quot;  The phenomenon of family dissolution
is  a virtually universal concomitant of development; indeed,
it is especially pronounced in the most highly developed nations
as individuals tend to supplant family (agrarian) units as the
primary  sources of production.  Asserting the problem of family
breakup at the outset of the document  will serve to buttress
family preservation as an essential component of development throughout
 the declaration.    
<P>
Page 3, paragraph 4.  &quot;Peace and security&quot; are insufficient
descriptors of national aspirations.   This paragraph should be
modified to read &quot;the achievement and maintenance of conditions
of  freedom, peace and security with and between ... cannot be
attained in the absence of conditions of freedom, peace and security.&quot;
 This language is needed to express the basic condition  of political
freedom as the key to economic and human progress.  Conditions
of &quot;peace and  security,&quot; at least in the military sense,
prevailed in Soviet Russia and numerous authoritarian  regimes
of East Asia, Africa, and the Americas.  Peace and security alone
are insufficient conditions for human wellbeing and development.
<P>
Page 4, paragraph 11, line 2.  The word &quot;contradiction&quot;
should be modified to read &quot;contrast.&quot;  This distinction
may not carry over well in other languages besides English, but
it is important that the document not be read to assert that in
every case the expansion of prosperity occurs for some at the
expense of the poverty of others.   All wealth is not the product
of exploitation.  Were it so, development by definition would
be a zero sum game in which no real improvement in overall global
living standards is possible.  The declaration must reject this
notion in principle. &quot;Contrast&quot; better suggests the
morally troubling existence of stark inequities in the distribution
of the world's basic resources.    
<P>
Page 4, paragraph 12, line 3,  The word &quot;people&quot; or
&quot;peoples&quot; appears to be missing after  &quot;Globalization
also permits.&quot;    
<P>
Page 4, paragraph 14, subparagraph a, line 2, add the following
language:  &quot;the gap between rich and poor, aggravated by
cultural factors and social mores, has increased.&quot;  This
addition recognizes that the economic gap between rich and poor
is not purely an economic phenomenon. In the United States, for
example, families headed by a single parent are five times more
likely to be poor than are families headed by two parents.  Casual
attitudes regarding divorce and sexual activity outside of marriage
have fueled these inequities.    
<P>
Page 6, paragraph (h).  Language is needed here to suggest, as
economically as possible, that &quot;family,&quot; while expressed
in different cultural and legal terms in many countries, nonetheless
has an archetypal and crosscultural meaning.  If we can speak
of &quot;equity and equality&quot; between men and women at various
points in the document, we can also make clear that the family
is an archetypal arrangement of man and woman, and their offspring,
and others related to them by  blood, marriage and adoption. 
<P>
Page 7, paragraph 21.  This paragraph needs to be strengthened
to include recognition of due  principles of subsidiarity and
of the possibility that government, even when wellmeaning, may
 overreach and become the principal obstacle to the attainment
of development.  Thus, language  should be added which states:
 We acknowledge the [primary] special responsibility of  governments,
particularly those units of government closest to and most accountable
to the  people, to attain these goals.  We also acknowledge that
they cannot be achieved by government  alone, and that, indeed,
governments may hinder development by overinvolvement in and 
disruption of healthy social and economic activity.    
<P>
Page 8, commitment 2, subparagraph b.  Modify to read:  &quot;the
provision of primary health care  and the promotion of reproductive
health and voluntary and informed family planning for  married
couples, reinforcement of the social and legal significance of
the archetypal family unit, safe drinking water ...&quot;  Addition
of &quot;voluntary&quot; is necessary to affirm the right of couples
to reject the &quot;provision&quot; of family planning; reference
to the marital couple is a natural correlative  of the term &quot;family&quot;
in family planning.  The role of the dissolution of the family
in fostering  intractable poverty is described above.    
<P>
Page 8, commitment 2, subparagraph c.  &quot;access to land, credit&quot;
should be modified to read  &quot;opportunity to acquire land,
credit ...&quot;  The emphasis must be on expanded opportunities,
and  the United Nations should make clear that it is not endorsing
policies of expropriation and confiscation of lawfully acquired
and owned resources.

the archetypal family.&quot; 
<P>
Page 10, commitment 5, subparagraph b:  &quot;Establish policies
[objectives and measurable goals] to  enhance gender balance.&quot;
 This language clearly stipulates the formulation of quotas for
political representation of women, presumably created and enforced
by the United Nations and its instrumentalities.  As such, this
language is at war with the declaration's expressed commitment
to respect for national sovereignty and decentralization of developmental
initiatives.  Moreover, it is  false in principle.  The key to
equity and equality is opportunity.  Government policies should
 indeed guarantee such opportunities, and those governments that
do so will reap the richest rewards in diverse and freely chosen
representation.  Republican forms of government are incompatible
with quotas, and republican forms are precisely those that have
proven most resilient in  expanding political participation by
all citizens.    
<P>
Page 10, commitment 5, subparagraph c.  In this context, there
is no reason to exclude men from protections against &quot;exploitation,
abuse and violence.&quot;  Violence against entrepreneurs in the
 United States, for example, frequently takes the form of attacks
upon disfavored ethnic groups  engaged in lawful business activity
in the cities.  Prejudice and violence against citizens of foreign
extraction is also common in many countries.  Both of these types
of phenomena are severe hindrances to the development of small
enterprises in economically depressed communities.  The selective
nature of much of this violence against men certifies it as an
issue of equity and equality.  Therefore, the subparagraph should
read:  &quot;Take effective measures to eliminate all kinds of
 exploitation, abuse and violence against men and women, with
particular attention to  immigrants, [women] refugees, and [women]
noncombatants in situations of armed conflict.&quot;    
<P>
Page 10, commitment 5, subparagraph d.  &quot;Encourage the ratification,
[removal of reservations,]  and implementation of all provisions
...&quot;  The United Nations is to be expected to encourage the
 ratification of international instruments approved by the General
Assembly.  Reservations, however, are a critical mechanism by
which sovereign nations adduce understandings that protect  important
cultural and legal values and policies.  In this particular regard,
reservations in many  nations preserve understandings regarding
special protections for women and mothers, and for  their offspring,
born and unborn.  The language as written is once again at war
with the declaration's commitment to respect national sovereignty.
 It is intrusive and should be modified as noted.    
<P>
Page 11, subparagraph d.  &quot;Increase official development
assistance, both in total and for social  programs, without coercion
or reducing the resources allocated to other sectors.&quot;  This
language is needed to address the continuing problem of assistance
linkage:  the withholding or threatened withholding of assistance
funds from nations which do not conform national policies to donor
nation's preferences in such areas as population control.  Addition
of coercion or reinforces the declaration's commitment to national
sovereignty.    
<P>
Page 11, commitment 7, subparagraph a.  &quot;Protect basic social
programs and expenditures, in  particular, those affecting the
weakest and most vulnerable segments of society, from acrosstheboard
budget reductions, while eliminating inefficient spending and
perverse incentives against work and family formation, and increasing
the quality of social expenditures.&quot;    
<P>
Page 12, commitment 8, subparagraph d.  &quot;Ensure that taxation
systems are fair, [and] economically efficient, and nonpunitive,&quot;
<P>
Page 16, paragraph 4.  &quot;Social development is also clearly
linked to the development of peace, freedom, stability and security
...  to promote social development requires a reorientation of
values, objectives, and priorities, in order to strengthen or
reform existing institutions and  policies.  Human dignity, [equity]
equal opportunity, freedom  and social justice must be ...&quot;
 The rationale for each of these suggested changes is outlined
in similar contexts above.  Note that the strengthening of all
existing institutions should clearly not be the objective of the
United  Nations in this declaration.  Many national institutions,
both private and public are, in fact,  destructive of human wellbeing.
 The declaration itself calls for reform of multilateral lending
 policies to the most debtridden nations.  No one, for example,
should support strengthening of  the UNFPA, which has exhibited
warm relations with national governments employing population
policies deeply destructive of human life and human freedom. 
<P>
Page 16, paragraph 5.  &quot;This same global community is threatened
by environmental degradation, epidemics, various forms of intolerance,
attacks and stresses upon the archetypal family unit, sexual exploitation
and the drug trade, violence and criminality . . . &quot;    
<P>
Page 16, paragraph 7.  &quot;Gender equity and equality of opportunity
[and the full participation of  women] in all economic, social
and political activities is essential.&quot;  Besides being redundant
as  written, this phrase could be abused to discourage governmental
policies that protect full or parttime homemakers and that permit
them to freely choose the terms of their participation in  economic
and other activities.  The right of families to establish their
own patterns of workfamily  involvement must be affirmed.  Another
alternative here is to change the word &quot;full&quot; to &quot;open.&quot;
  Ask yourself this question:  which nation of the world has the
fullest participation of women in  economic activities?  Clearly,
it is the People's Republic of China, with its cadres and worker
 brigades.  Free nations typically exhibit much more diverse and
complex arrangements, with equality of opportunity guaranteed
and norms of participation left to individual and family choice
and capability.  This is the more socially just and free condition.
<P>
Page 17, bulleted items:  Add &quot;a strengthened role for the
archetypal family, churches and  private associations for selfbetterment;&quot;
and &quot;public policies that discourage illegal and/or  selfdestructive
behaviors that shorten lifespan and/or reduce productivity.&quot;
 The latter  language should be unexceptionable; it is aimed at
such practices as smoking, drug abuse, and  activities that transmit
HIV and other diseases.  The impact of these factors on human
lifespan, productivity, and development is clearly massive.  
 
<P>
Page 18, paragraph 11, add a subparagraph e:  Promoting the expansion
of political freedom in the context of transitions to market economies,
and directing development assistance to smallscale and private
ventures that maximize individual creativity and initiative. 
<P>
Page 19, paragraph 13, subparagraph e:  &quot;... and ensuring
that subsidy systems benefit people in  poverty, avoid incentives
to nonproductive lifestyles and family breakup, and reduce disparities.&quot;
As noted above, family breakup is a key determinant and perpetuator
of poverty; subsidy  (welfare) programs should avoid designs that
punish intact families and reward illegitimacy.

Page 20, paragraph 14, subparagraph a:  &quot;Ensuring that institutions
 public, private, and  natural, including the family unit  and
agencies responsible for the design and implementation ...&quot;
 This language eliminates any possible bias toward governmental
institutions as  opposed to private and natural institutions engaged
in critical social development, primarily the family, business,
and religious denominations.    
<P>
Page 20, paragraph 14, subparagraph b:  The phrase &quot;full
transparency ... for all ... private  institutions&quot; raises
important questions for private associations, including churches,
which are  generally accorded far more freedom of action than
governmental and quasigovernmental  institutions that operate
with public funds.  This subparagraph should be amended to include
 language respecting the privacy rights of voluntary and religious
institutions except insofar as  necessary to meet generally accepted
standards of accountability under the laws of each nation.   Without
such language, private institutions are vulnerable to treatment
as publicly owned entities.  Therefore, add &quot;Nothing in this
subparagraph shall be construed to diminish the right of  voluntary
and religious institutions to appropriate privacy protections
consistent with generally accepted standards of accountability
under the law.&quot;    
<P>
Page 20, paragraph 14, subparagraph c:  Throughout the document,
no attempt is made to define  &quot;discrimination&quot; or to
limit in any way its application to only those characteristics
of persons  rightly regarded as &quot;neutral&quot;   ethnicity,
national origin, creed, gender, disability, etc.  It may be  better
to leave this term undefined, on the presumption that prevailing
national policies, which  generally protect only neutral characteristics,
are what is meant.  Nonetheless, the recent action in the European
Parliament to protect homosexual partnerships, and US initiatives
to expand &quot;domestic partnership&quot; legislation offer some
argument for defining &quot;discrimination&quot; here to mean
only the protection of neutral characteristics.  Possible language:
 &quot;Eliminating de jure  discrimination, while [ developing]
encouraging educational programmes and media campaigns  aimed
at eliminating de facto discrimination against persons based on
race, sex, national  origin, religion, political affiliation,
disability, or other characteristics unrelated to character or
performance.

Page 20, paragraph 14, subparagraph f:  &quot;Making political
and social processes inclusive of all  lawabiding members of society
...&quot;  Many nationstates exclude criminals from access to
certain political and social processes.  The phrase as written,
like much of the declaration, is  susceptible of widely varying
interpretation, but as written it appears open to abuse.  The
best course of action may be to delete the phrase &quot;inclusive
of all members of society and&quot;, since &quot;respecting political
pluralism and cultural diversity&quot; sufficiently describes
an open political  system.    
<P>
Page 20, paragraph 15, subparagraph c:  &quot;ensuring that all
obstacles to full equity and equality  between women and men are
removed in all private and public institutions of society.&quot;
 The  dangers in this language are obvious.  The United Nations
is hereby committing itself to eliminating anything it regards
as inequities between men and women in private institutions. 
If  churches and parachurch organizations are excepted from this
proscription, that fact is not  mentioned.  These issues have
created tremendous friction and debate in the United States and
 elsewhere in the developed world.  Most US &quot;equal rights&quot;
statutes have been limited in their  application to &quot;public
accommodations,&quot; a term which embraces many private institutions
that  hold themselves forward as open to the public, but excludes
those, such as churches and other  religiously affiliated institutions,
which impose membership requirements based on creed.  Most US
statutes, with one or two exceptions, also exempt private, nonpublicly
supported clubs and  associations (e.g., the Boy Scouts, the YMCA).
 This principle should be protected here.  &quot;Public accommodations&quot;
is not a term common to UN documents.  I recommend revision to
read &quot;all  [private and] public and publicly accessible institutions
of society&quot;.    
<P>
Page 21, paragraph 16, subparagraph a:  The language as written
suggests governmental  interference with the media to ensure socially
constructive attitudes.  The goal is laudable, but its implementation
by government is violative of free speech standards and guarantees.
 The purposes  of government in this regard are better served
by policies that encourage the development of a diverse body of
mass media.  Increasing the body of media voices, not stifling
an errant few, is a proper sphere for government action.  It is
akin to averting the growth of monopolies in the economic sphere.
 If language stating this objective cannot be obtained, change
&quot;Ensuring&quot; to  &quot;Encouraging&quot; to leave this
objective in the realm of the bully pulpit.    
<P>
Page 21, paragraph 16, subparagraph c:  &quot;including on gender,
family and cultural issues ...&quot;  The paragraph as written
is narrow and excludes needed improvements in data collection
on  issues of family structure and culture.  For example, international
data preliminarily examined by scholars at the American Enterprise
Institute suggests a close linkage between infant mortality and
 family structure.  Gender analysis is one of only many relevant
possible areas for improvement.    
<P>
Page 21, paragraph 17, subparagraph d:  &quot;... policies to
combat terrorism, organized crime,  sexual exploitation and drug
trafficking.&quot;  This additional language gives higher visibility
and  priority to efforts to combat the exploitation of minors
in South Asia and elsewhere around the  world where the international
sex and pornography trade are officially ignored or inadequately
 resisted.    
<P>
Page 22, paragraph 20:  The personal dimension of poverty is excluded
from this analysis of the  origins of poverty.  It is most easily
addressed by modifying the first sentence of the paragraph to
read &quot;and cultural and personal values.&quot;  Without more,
however, this entire section focuses too  heavily on &quot;political
and economic structures&quot; and too lightly on personality structures
such as  selfdiscipline, deferral of gratification, honesty and
hard work.  To address this problem, add  after &quot;those who
cannot support themselves&quot; the following: &quot;to foster
personal qualities of selfdiscipline, honesty, hard work, and
the deferral of gratification;&quot;    
<P>
Page 24, paragraph 26, subparagraph a:  The most important indicator
of poverty is family  structure.  This indicator must be added
to the litany of poverty and vulnerability indicators.    
<P>
Page 26, paragraph 29, subparagraph a:  Language should be added
to the phrase &quot;redistributing  land&quot; to bar expropriation
and confiscation of lawfully owned and managed property.  The
US  Constitution includes a &quot;takings clause,&quot; which
obliges government to compensate owners for  lawfully expropriated
or attached property.  Even in developed countries, this principle
is  irregularly and inadequately followed.  This paragraph should
read:  &quot;encouraging the  redistribution of [redistributing]
land where necessary to foster a return to productive use  and
where full compensation and other due process of law is guaranteed
to lawful owners.&quot;    
<P>
Page 26, paragraph 30, subparagraph a:  &quot;access of people
living in poverty to responsible levels  of credit ...&quot; 
The United Nations should not require any lending institution
to make irresponsible  loans.  In fact, the declaration's clear
and repeated call for debt restructuring and forgiveness for 
developing nations dramatizes the fact that irresponsible lending
that ignores economic viability damages both the lending institution
and the dependent party.  This experience must be applied to micro
as well as macroeconomics.    
<P>
Page 26, paragraph 30, subparagraph c:  &quot;Providing incentives
for [, earmarking percentages of  the lending base].  In line
with the criticism noted above, lending institutions must retain,
for the sake of their depositors as well as the wellbeing of borrowers,
reasonable standards of viability and repayability for all loans
in their portfolio.  Encouraging lenders to provide responsible
levels  of credit to impoverished persons for socially valuable
purposes is a laudable aim, but setasides  and quotas can only
encourage distortions in the loan market and the placement of
irresponsible  loans.  This will not alleviate poverty and may,
in fact, hinder normal patterns of development.    
<P>
Page 27, paragraph 32, subparagraph b:  The phrase &quot;full
and equal access&quot; to health services  suggests that the same
standards of service that apply to women should apply to girls.
 The  implication is that services to be provided are identical
irrespective of maturity, marital status, or other factors.  Add
at the end of this sentence, &quot;with due regard for the responsibility
of  government to protect the vulnerability of the immature and
the sanctuary of the family.&quot;    
<P>
Page 28, paragraph 33, add a new subparagraph i, and adjust the
following subparagraph accordangle:  &quot;Encouraging the formation
and retention of stable family units, as a shield against poverty,
the appropriate locus for sexual expression, childbearing and
childrearing, and the essential factor in successful education
and the creation of productive and responsible  citizens.&quot;
<P>
Page 28, paragraph 34, subparagraph c:  The antagonism, in some
nations, between formal and  nonformal education for preschoolers
should be acknowledged.  To some extent, these objectives can
be mutually exclusive.  Numerous education experts believe that
nonformal education  within the family is significantly healthier
and more effective than early formal education before a child
is emotionally or psychologically ready to learn.  The best way
to address this concern is to add the word voluntary before &quot;preschool
education&quot; to assure that mandates do not drive out parental
education of young children in the home. 
<P>
Page 29, paragraph 34, subparagraph d:  Same changes as recommended
for Page 8, commitment 2, subparagraph b.    
<P>
Page 29, paragraph 34, subparagraph e:  Removing objectionable
language in this context may  prove impossible.  I recommend instead
that language be added to encourage the provision of  health care
to expectant mothers and the children they carry that will enable
them to carry those  children successfully to term.  &quot;Safe
motherhood&quot; must be made to be synonymous with safety for
 both mother and child  this is logical because, without the child,
it is not motherhood at all. The strategy of proabortion organizations
at Cairo was to move away from an individual conception  of maternal
health that focuses on the health of every motherandchild in utero
toward a collective, public healthoriented concept that denies
the need to protect the health of mother and child in all circumstances.
 This is one occasion where the faulty language in the declaration
can be improved by making it truly universal, i.e., protective
of all mothers and children.  Amend this language to read &quot;full
access to such services, including voluntary and informed reproductive
health/family planning care for married couples [and], education
on safe motherhood, and  supportive services for all expectant
mothers and the children they carry, [and prenatal and postnatal
care] both prenatally and postnatally.    
<P>
Page 29, paragraph 35, subparagraph e.  &quot;Expanding and strengthening
social insurance   programmes and tax policies to protect working
people ...&quot;  Burdensome taxation can subject  working families
to poverty.  Recently the United States reformed a program called
the Earned  Income Tax Credit to provide additional income to
lift working families above the poverty line.   Broadly considered,
this is a &quot;social insurance&quot; programme, but the key
is that it is based on an  alleviation of taxation on the working
family, not the direct imposition of a tax on families or  other
entities.   
<P>
Page 30, paragraph 36, subparagraph d:  &quot;Improving the status
of the single parent in society&quot; is  opposed to policies
that responsibly discourage the deliberate choice of single parenthood
or  sexual irresponsibility.  Assisting single parents to care
for their child is generally sound policy,  but even here society
gains nothing by refusing to recognize that promotion of adoption
is the  better alternative for many single mothers.  To avoid
these notional difficulties, amend this  subparagraph to read:
[&quot;Improving the status of the single parent in society and]
Ensuring that  singleparent families receive the social support
they need, include support for adequate housing and the child
care of their choice, with special emphasis on incentives for
marriage and  strengthening extended family networks.&quot;  
<P>
Page 32, paragraph 43, bullet one:  The &quot;full participation
of employers and trade unions&quot;  excludes the vast majority
of the world's workers.  Add &quot;nonunionized workers&quot;
to this phrase.    
<P>
Page 34, paragraph 46, add a subparagraph g:  &quot;Establishing
policies to encourage invention and entrepreneurship, to protect
the products of invention and entrepreneurship from  misappropriation,
and to provide inventors and entrepreneurs with access to capital
and  economic rewards sufficient to encourage the development
and introduction of new technologies and methods.&quot;  Much
technological development takes place outside &quot;national and
local technology institutions; indeed, the home computer revolution
was largely sparked by the  technical wizardry of two Americans
working out of a garage.  Assurance of economic rewards,  protection
of copyrights and patents, and access to capital are as or more
critical than support for technology institutions as a means to
promote employmentintensive growth.  Experience demonstrates that
governments cannot always predict, produce, or judge which technologies
will have the most profound impact in promoting economic growth
and human betterment.    
<P>
Page 34, paragraph 47, subparagraph d:  Revise to read &quot;increasing
family benefits and social  support such as equitable and substantial
financial support for all forms of child care, including care
at home.       
<P>
Page 38, paragraph 55, subparagraph d.  This paragraph is a glaring
demonstration of the  irreconcilability of the declaration's claimed
dedication to sovereignty and its clear commitment to utilize
United Nations instrumentalities to change attitudes toward the
division of paid labor and housework!  Many families around the
world obviously do not wish their attitudes to be changed.  They
believe explicitly in the social and childrearing advantages of
a single wageearner  structure.  They have no wish to impose those
structure on all peoples and families around the globe.  They
adopt such patterns as sequencing in which a primary caregiver,
usually the mother, leaves the paid labor force to devote herself
fulltime to the care of her family, only to return to paid labor
as the children enter formal schooling or are fully grown.  That
the United Nations would seek to use its resources to foster the
destruction of such patterns is reprehensible, but it will also
ultimately be futile.  This language is a retreaded version of
the most doctrinaire  feminism that is losing popularity even
in the most advanced nations.  If language of any kind is  needed,
it should state only &quot;Devising public policies that support
maximum family choice and empowerment over questions of parental
division of labor.&quot;  The reference to &quot;child care  facilities&quot;
appears to favor the least popular form of child care in the United
States, i.e.,  institutional child care.  This phrase should be
modified to read, as above, support for all forms  of child care,
including home care and family care.  The phrase profamily tax
relief should  also be added to this litany of workfamily policies,
as this issue transcends all the others in  promoting family freedom.
 Other objections could be raised to this paragraph, but these
are the  major ones.    
<P>
Page 38, paragraph 55, subparagraph e.  On the scale of public
values, encouraging fathers and  mothers to stay together is far
more important than using atomic scales to measure gender  equality
in diaperchanging and other domestic duties.  Nearly all studies
of child care issues point out that most parents would prefer
to have one or both working parents spend more time with their
children, if loss of income were not an issue.  The point is that
all of these subparagraphs ignore parental choice and parental
preferences and subordinate them to the goal of encouraging women
to take paid employment.  Other than ideology, it is not clear
why this should be so.  This  paragraph should be replaced with
one that reads:  Encouraging governments to recognize the unique
contributions of families with children and to adopt policies
that maximize parental time spent in childrearing activities and
minimize the need for families to spend inordinate time in paid
labor activities at the expense of overall family wellbeing. 
The goal here is to encourage at least some form of a family wage
system that leaves each parent's role as the parents mutually
agree.  Parttime, flexible, and home working schedules promote
this result, as well.    
<P>
Page 41, paragraph 64, add to the last bullet item listed:  &quot;violence,
crime, drug abuse and  trafficking, sexual exploitation, and other
behaviors that diminish productivity, shorten lifespan and spread
disease.  This language is needed to assure that &quot;respect
for diversity&quot; does not  include respect for actions that
involve a dimension of personal immorality.  &quot;Diversity&quot;
properly means neutral differences, not moral disputes about issues
of character.    
<P>
Page 41, paragraph 66, subparagraph c:  Revise to read &quot;Giving
community organizations,  private associations and natural institutions
like the family greater control . . .&quot;                  
<P>
Page 42, paragraph 67, subparagraph a:  The phrase &quot;as appropriate&quot;
may suffice to address  concern about the overextension of prohibitions
on discrimination to distinctly moral categories. Marriage laws
currently &quot;discriminate&quot; against samegender pairs. 
Enacting legislation to  reverse this situation would be inappropriate,
but it may be wiser to nail this down with some  effort to define
unacceptable discrimination.  Note the language at page 40, paragraph
59 that  comes close to defining the scope of acceptable prohibitions
on discrimination:  &quot;different groups which are defined by
language, ethnicity, religion, geography or class.&quot;  This
internal definition  may offer a route to an acceptably limited
definition of discrimination, with the addition of gender and
disability.    
<P>
Page 42, paragraph 67, subparagraph b:  [removal of reservations],
for the reasons noted above.    
<P>
Page 45, paragraph 71, subparagraph a:  In many places in the
declaration, the emphasis on the  elimination of violence against
certain groups in society (armed conflict, for example) is culturally
true and entirely appropriate.  Here it is mystifying.  Young
males are disproportionately the victims of homicide (at the hands
of other young males, in most cases) in developed countries, including
the United States.  On the general issue of social violence, thereis
absolutely no need for gender oneupmanship.  The United Nations
should never jettison concern for violence against young men,
who are among the most pathetic victims of family breakup in advanced
societies.  I recommend ending the first sentence of this paragraph
as follows, &quot;with particular attention to vulnerable persons
who are the most frequent victims of violent acts.&quot;  Crime
and violence are pervasive enough that they should never be turned
into mere group politics.    
<P>
Page 47.  Nearly every word on this page illustrates the tension
in this document between its  repeated pledges to respect and
promote &quot;decentralization,&quot; government &quot;closest
to the people,&quot;  &quot;national sovereignty,&quot; &quot;small
business entrepreneurs&quot; and &quot;grassroots/community organizations.&quot;
   As national strategies are here designed, &quot;priorities
and time frames&quot; are the responsibility of national governments.
 &quot;Massive political will to invest in people&quot; is required
to achieve these goals.  All of this is &quot;primarily the responsibility
of national Governments.&quot;  The declaration does not strive
to reconcile these contradictory themes and objectives.  In small
nationstates, national Governments may in fact be close to the
people.  In large nations, they are remote, and the general direction
of policy reform is running counter to central government solutions.
 The declaration's only attempt to resolve this problem is to
include language at various points that expresses all points of
view.  The irony of the United nations amassing resources and
summoning political will to promote local solutions ought not
to miss anyone's attention.  There are far too many problems with
this page to fix it, but it is probably the clearest expression
yet of the authors' actual intent in devising the programme of
action.

the most progressive nations are those that have the most debate

is only surfaced here, but its philosophical implications are
 profound.  It raises the possibility that the United Nations
Economic and Social Council will take on the characteristics of
an extralateral, rather than multilateral institution.  Such a
mechanism  would inevitably diminish individual nations' role
in managing and overseeing the development of  United Nations
policy.  This paragraph deserves wide publicity and debate now.
 Similar concerns are raised by the references to international
taxation and involuntary financing of the United  Nations at paragraphs
85 b and 86 g.

<title>WOMEN IN COMBAT: CREATING SEXUAL TENSION</title>

CREATING SEXUAL TENSION</h2>

<p>
The Clinton Administration's women-in-combat policy has created
an atmosphere which may make it difficult for officers to comply
with combat-related military service.  The recent case of Navy
helicopter pilot Lieutenant Commander Ken Carkhuff illustrates
the unfortunate turn that the pursuit of a gender-blind military
may be taking for the US Navy and for those who object to the
policy. 
<P>
On August 24, 1994, Carkhuff told his executive officer, &quot;I
cannot take this detachment to sea.&quot;  The detachment included
two female pilots, and Carkhuff later explained, &quot;I could
not appear to endorse a policy [the women-in-combat policy] that
I didn't agree with.&quot; Carkhuff's statement disqualified him
from leading his detachment. His commander relieved him of his
duties and two officer boards have concluded that Carkhuff should
be honorably discharged from the service.[1]
<P>
Carkhuff told the &quot;show cause&quot; board on May 18, 1995,
&quot;I think that we should not be subjecting... women to violence,
and there is no more extreme violence that a human can be involved
in than in combat.&quot;[2]  He said that he was not anxious to confront
the policy and stated that he had no objection to women serving
in the Navy.[3]
<P>
Carkhuff had, in fact, just completed a year at the Naval War
College where the issue of women in combat was debated extensively.
 He had strong and religiously-based views on this issue.  The
day he privately stated his view to his boss corresponded to the
birth of his fifth child, a daughter.  Carkhuff feared that leading
women into a possible combat situation [the US invasion of Haiti
was weeks away] would incrementally lead to expanded combat roles
for women and perhaps his own daughter's forced combat role in
the future.
<P>
Commander Carkhuff did state at the hearing that &quot;if ordered
to execute that policy, I will do it.&quot;[4]  Nevertheless, the
Navy stood by its decision to discharge him honorably.
<P>
This case raises questions about a double standard at work in
the Navy on the issue of voicing personal opinions about women
in combat.  In 1992, uniformed female Navy officers gathered on
Capitol Hill to lobby against the female combat 
ban, labeling it an &quot;equal opportunity issue.&quot;  The
Navy ignored regulations which restrict uniformed sailors from
personal lobbying and did not discipline these officers.  However,
Carkhuff's private protest resulted in an honorable discharge.
 This would demonstrate that violations committed while protesting
in support of women in combat are ignored, while those protests
against the policy of women in combat are punished.
<P>
More importantly, this case raises questions about whether the
Navy is in danger of losing good men due to its women-in-combat
policy.  Carkhuff was a proven officer with consistently high
performance ratings.  Assuming there are other exemplary men who,
because of such policies, will cut short their military careers,
the military does not profit.  Nor does it profit from the fact
that this policy may discourage some would-be &quot;top guns&quot;
from responding to recruitment appeals to pursue a military career.
<P>
The Clinton Administration has erased more than 250,000 combat
exemptions for women.  Today, women can be assigned to 95 percent
of all Navy billets.  Feminists say this is progress, but combat
veterans and our combat-hardened allies know this portends disaster.
 In fact, the Navy's policy of women in combat is contrary to
the findings of the 1992 Presidential Commission on the Assignment
of Women in the Armed Forces.
<P>
The board reviewing Carkhuff did not find that Carkhuff lacked
the ability to perform.  According to Navy documents, he is being
honorably separated for disagreeing with a politically sensitive
policy, and for refusing to perform a duty.
<P>
When officers so strongly protest, it is time for the Pentagon
and Congress to reconsider the wisdom of policies that increase
the combat role of women.  Men like Carkhuff deserve the opportunity
to honorably serve, rather than have their careers cut short by
an unfortunate and dangerous policy.

<title>MARRIAGE PROTECTS WOMEN FROM VIOLENCE</title>

<p>
<h2>MARRIAGE PROTECTS WOMEN<br>
FROM VIOLENCE</h2>
<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>
Studies and pronouncements about violence against women continue
to make headlines.  Recently, the Justice Department announced
that a redesigned national survey found that violence against
women is much higher than previously reported.  The survey also
reveals that marriage often shields women from violence.  
<P>
Any violence against women should be strongly condemned, and offenders
should be punished to the full extent of the law.   But some feminists
exaggerate the real scope of this tragic problem using unvetted
advocacy research.   Consider some advocacy reporting:
<UL>
<LI>&quot;There are three to four million women beaten by husbands
or lovers every year; that's one every 15 seconds.&quot;  (<I>Chicago
Tribune</I>, February 10, 1992)
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>&quot;Four million to six million women are beaten [each year].
 That means once every five seconds...a woman is punched or kicked...or
held down and pummeled.&quot;  (Associated Press)[1]
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Miami talk-show host Pat Stevens told a <I>Crossfire</I> audience
that 60 million women are abused every year.[2]
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><I>Ms</I>. magazine's &quot;Campus Project on Sexual Assault&quot;
claims that 15.4 percent of college women are raped and 12.1 percent
experience an attempted rape each year.[3]
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>When President Clinton named Bonnie Campbell to head the &quot;Violence
Against Women&quot; office at the Justice Department, he said
there are 700,000 rapes or attempted rapes every year.[4]
</UL>
<P>
<P>
The bases for these &quot;facts&quot; are seldom given and they
should be suspect.  After all, there are 31,536,000 seconds in
a year.  If an American woman is victimized every 15 seconds,
then there are in reality 2,124,000 incidents.  Five million violent
female victimizations would be one every 6.3 seconds.
<P>
The August, 1995 Bureau of Justice Statistics study, &quot;Violence
Against Women: Estimates from the Redesigned Survey,&quot; provides
a different, although, sobering picture.[5]
Men are far more likely to be victims of crime (64.9 v. 43.7 per
1,000 persons) than women.[6]   But women are nine times more likely
than men to become rape/sexual assault victims.[7]   That figure
is higher than previously reported.
<P>
The new survey estimates there are 500,200 female victimizations
each year which includes 172,400 completed rapes and 141,200 attempted
rapes.[8]  In comparison, the FBI previously reported 109,062 forcible
rapes for 1992, which was a 38.2 percent rise in the total number
of reported rapes and a 27 percent rate increase since 1973.[9]
<P>
The study is based on the redesigned National Crime Victimization
Survey (NCVS) which is a continuous nationally representative
sample of 50,000 households.  The latest report includes the years
1992-1993 and with revised questions it found that the average
annual rate of violent victimization per 1,000 women rose from
5.4 in 1987-91 to 9.4.[10]
<P>
The woman's relationship to the offender is a key variable.  The
1995 study found that a woman is three times more likely to be
raped or sexually assaulted by a boyfriend and 10 times more likely
to be raped or sexually assaulted by an acquaintance thanby a
spouse.  Single women are just as likely to be raped or sexually
assaulted by a stranger as they are by a boyfriend.[11]
<P>
When all acts of violence against women are considered, married
or widowed women are 30 times less likely than separated women
to become violence victims.  Married women are at least four times
less likely than never-married women to be crime victims.[12]
<P>
The study also found that women aged 19-29 are the most likely
violence victims.  They are twice as likely to become victims
as 30 to 45 year old women and 12 to 18 year old girls.[13]  Although
the Justice Department report does not explain the difference,
U.S. Census Bureau statistics show that the older female cohort
tends to be married and the younger cohort is more likely to live
in homes where there is a protecting father.[14]
<P>
Family income also makes a big difference.  Women from middle
income families tend to be four times safer than those from families
with incomes under $10,000.  Education, ethnicity and race are
not major violence discriminators.[15]
<P>
<center><h3>CONCLUSIONS ABOUT VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN</h3></center>
<P>
Incidents of rape and sexual assault are officially higher than
previously reported but do not come close to the figures offered
by some advocacy researchers.  Based on the new survey it's too
early to determine whether violence against women is rising. 
But it's clear that the offender/victim relationship is key and
deserves more attention.
<P>
Young women (19-29 years old), who have never married (or are
separated) and have low incomes are most vulnerable to violence.
 Their offenders are more likely to be known to them, and crime
by non-strangers usually occurs at or near the woman's home. 
<P>
The survey shows that marriage protects all female cohorts from
every type of violence.  Married women are safer than single,
separated, divorced and never-married women.    
<P>
Marriage also reduces violent crime incidents among men.  It helps
to channel male aggression toward positive goals.  Never-married
men are more likely to commit assault and they suffer most (58.9
percent) assaults.[16]  They are also five times more likely to rape
and commit other violent crime than married men.[17]
<P>
The Justice Department's latest report should encourage government
to harness marriage as a shield against violence.  The report
also tells American women and girls that the safest place today
is living in homes with their husbands and fathers.

<title>THE STRAIGHT STORY ON NEW JERSEY</title>

<h2>THE STRAIGHT STORY<br>

BIRTHS, ABORTIONS, AND THE FAMILY CAP</h2>

<p>
In August of 1993, the first &quot;family cap&quot; in the nation
took effect in the state of New Jersey as part of a larger package
of reforms known as the Family Development Program.  The family
cap provision stipulates that a mother who has already received
welfare benefits for at least 10 months and who bears an additional
child will receive no increase in her basic monthly AFDC benefit.
 The provision affects only the monthly <I>cash</I> benefit, however.
 Health benefits and food stamps continue to increase with family
size.
<P>
The raw numbers of births and abortions in New Jersey since the
cap took effect strongly suggest that the policy has reduced the
number of births to AFDC mothers without affecting the abortion
rate.
<P>
Raw data for the 20-month period from August 1992 to March 1994
appears in Table 1:

<P>
The total number of abortions in the year before the policy took
effect was 11,817, yielding a monthly average of 984.75.  In the
eight months after the policy took effect (including March 1994,
which had a far higher total of abortions than any other month
on record), the total number of abortions was 7,932, yielding
a monthly average of 991.5.  The difference (0.7%) is trivial
and well within the expected range of random fluctuation.  If
the anomalous month of March were excluded from the analysis,
the average would be just 953 abortions per month after the introduction
of the family cap -- a 3% decline from the previous year's average,
but also trivial enough to be within the range of random fluctuation.
<P>
A more comprehensive look at the data reduces the significance
of the difference even further.  The average monthly caseload
in the year before the family cap was enacted was 121,479.  In
the eight months post-cap, the average monthly caseload was 122,679
-- a difference of less than 1%.  But the monthly abortion rate
(number of abortions per 1,000 AFDC cases) was 8.11 in the year
prior to enactment of the family cap and only 8.08 in the eight
months post-enactment.  The difference is too small to be statistically
significant, but it is worth noting that the total number of abortions
in the period after implementation of the cap was three <I>fewer</I>
than predicted by the rate before enactment of the policy.
<P>
Using the entire preceding year as the baseline, however, tends
to distort the real effect of the family cap because the abortion
rate was very low in the period ranging from August to November
1992.  During the eight months immediately preceding the introduction
of the cap (December 1992 to July 1993), New Jersey welfare mothers
underwent 8,144 abortions -- 212 <I>more</I> than in the eight
months after the cap took effect.  If the post-cap data did not
include the month of March 1994, moreover, the post-cap abortion
average would have been 8% less than the average for the previous
seven months.
<P>
No responsible statistician would therefore conclude that the
family cap must reduce abortions.  But an honest evaluation of
the available data strongly argues that, contrary to the fears
expressed by many in the pro-life community, the family cap has
had no impact on the number or rate of abortions among New Jersey's
AFDC recipients.  The monthly abortion totals fluctuated with
no apparent pattern, but were always within the expected range.
 The total number of abortions in the eight months post-cap was
almost exactly what would have been projected if there had been
no change in the state's welfare policy.
<P>
The birth rate among AFDC recipients, on the other hand, was significantly
lower after introduction of the family cap.  In the year prior
to the cap, the total number of births to welfare mothers in New
Jersey was 15,972, yielding a monthly average of 1,331 births
and a monthly rate of 10.96 births per thousand AFDC recipients.
 In the eight months post-cap, there were 9,519 births, yielding
a monthly average of 1,190 births and a monthly rate of 9.70 births
per thousand AFDC recipients.  The difference is consistent, substantial,
and statistically significant.
<P>
In all eight months after the introduction of the cap, the birth
totals were below the previous year's average and lower than the
total for the corresponding month in the previous year.  The monthly
abortion totals after implementation of the cap show a more random
pattern.  In six of the eight months, there were fewer abortions
than the previous year's average, but in only three of those months
was the abortion total lower than the total for the corresponding
month the year before.
<P>
When the entire 20-month period is divided into 4-month increments
(see Table 2), the change in the average number of births is obvious.
 The family cap has produced a significant reduction in the number
of births and pregnancies, but has had no discernible impact on
the number of abortions.

<P>
<P>
The only way to calculate a higher abortion rate for the post-cap
period is to suppress the data from April to July 1993 -- the
period immediately prior to implementation of the new policy --
and compare the abortion totals from the post-cap period with
the totals from the corresponding months of the previous year.
 <I>Unless the April to July 1993 data is suppressed, </I>the
abortion rate after implementation of the family cap appears to
be either the same as or lower than the abortion rate before the
cap.
<P>
There are only two hypotheses that could justify suppressing the
April to July 1993 data and preserve the finding that the abortion
rate has increased since implementation of the cap.
<P>
First, it is possible that the abortion rate follows an annual
cyclical pattern and that the monthly abortion totals from April
to July 1994 will show the same inflation as in 1993.  But a close
examination of the month-by-month totals suggests that the high
months and low months in the two years do not correspond with
enough consistency to indicate a seasonal cycle.  In 1992-1993,
the months with high abortion totals were October, January, and
March, while August, November, and December registered low totals.
 In 1993-1994, August and March were the months with a high number
of abortions, and the September total was relatively low.
<P>
The second hypothesis is that welfare mothers may have staged
an &quot;abortion rush&quot; prior to implementation of the family
cap, thereby generating unusually high abortion totals in the
months immediately preceding the change in policy.  But the single
month in which an &quot;abortion rush&quot; would have been most
visible, July 1993, had a lower abortion total than either June
1993 or August 1993.  The number of abortions declined between
June and July and increased between July and August.  The time
period with the highest number of abortions spanned six months,
from March to August -- straddling the enactment date -- and then
was followed by six months of low abortion totals after implementation
of the family cap.
<P>
While it is still premature to draw any decisive conclusions from
the welfare reform experiment in New Jersey, it is becoming increasingly
fantastic to claim that the state has experienced an upsurge in
abortions since the family cap took effect.  The reported &quot;increase&quot;
in abortions rests on a statistical illusion created by suppressing
data from the four-month period immediately preceding the policy
change -- which includes the highest abortion totals recorded
in the data under study.
<P>
Those who would hold welfare reform hostage in the name of saving
lives bear a significant burden of proof in maintaining that more
lives will be saved by preserving the current welfare system.
 The consistent, strong correlation between increased welfare
spending and increased abortions should be far more troublesome
data to pro-lifers than the most recent numbers from New Jersey.

<title>RENEWING THE AMERICAN DREAM FOR EDUCATION</title>

<h2>RENEWING THE AMERICAN DREAM<br>
FOR EDUCATION</h2>
<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>
<i>Jennifer A. Marshall</i></center>
<p>
High-profile advocates of public education lack an inspiring vision
for the educational renewal of America.  President Bill Clinton,
Secretary of Education Richard Riley, Congress, teacher union
bosses -- all alternately cheerlead and criticize, but their discussions
usually degenerate into bickering over funding, equity, and the
competitiveness of the American economy.  Ultimately, they are
concerned about the educational <I>system</I> and its place in
the larger context of American society and the national economy.
Little of what they have to say deals with the real stuff of
education.
<p>
Dorothy Sayers, an author and a contemporary of C.S. Lewis, articulated
half a century ago the foolishness of focusing on the system and
thereby missing the whole aim of education:
<p><blockquote>
What use is it to pile task on task and prolong the days of labor,
if at the close the chief object is left unattained?  It is not
the fault of the teachers -- they work only too hard already.
 The combined folly of a civilization that has forgotten its own
roots is forcing them to shore up the tottering weight of an educational
structure that is built upon sand....  For the sole true end of
education is simply this:  to teach men how to learn for themselves;
and whatever instruction fails to do this is effort spent in vain.[1]
</blockquote><p>
Sayers clearly had a vision of what education ought to be.
<p>
Today, once again, those with the academic zeal that rallies others
to renew education have a vision that goes beyond the realities
of the public school system.  Their common sense, optimistic ideas
are not constrained by the inadequacies of a federally run education
bureaucracy.  As Frenchman Alexis de Tocqueville remarked in 1835,
such freedom from bureaucracy is -- or at least once was -- distinctively
American:  &quot;Uniformity or permanence of design, the minute
arrangement of details, and the perfection of administrative system
must not be sought for in the United States; what we find there
is the presence of a power which, if it is somewhat wild, is at
least robust....&quot;[2] Homeschooling and classical education
exemplify this genius and vibrancy of the American people.
<p>
<center><h3>SCHOOLING BY THE TRUE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION</h3></center>
<p>
We have long known that the &quot;true department of education,&quot;
as author Douglas Wilson refers to the family, is the institution
behind the success of the homeschool movement.[3] Recent scholarship,
however, shows the role of the family in the academic success
of children in all settings. Because parents are vested with the
authority and responsibility to oversee their children's upbringing,
especially their education, homeschooling ought not to be considered
the method of last resort, but a first option.  Recent scholarship
demonstrates that, no matter what the school setting, family is
the key factor in the academic success of children.[4]
<p>
Critics may view homeschoolers as somewhat reclusive, but the
flourishing movement contributes to society much more than they
recognize.  Increased interaction within the family counters the
individualism and the &quot;generation gaps&quot; created by the
secular culture.  With some 400,000 families currently homeschooling,
the movement has also become a gathering point for inter-family
relations.  Networks and support groups abound (see the addendum
for a sample listing).  Though the homeschooling movement takes
a back-to-basics approach to academics, it is thoroughly progressive
when it comes to using the latest technology.  CompuServe and
America Online forums provide helpful hints on raising kids, curriculum
tips, homework help, and an ongoing discussion of a new ideal
for education.
<p>
Homeschoolers are some of the most politically involved private
citizens in America.  Politicians have learned not to trifle with
the &quot;stay-at-home mom&quot; with a phone tree, a fax machine,
and a firm devotion to raising well-grounded children.  Initially
a measure for self-defense, homeschoolers' lobbying efforts have
strengthened the platform for all families in America.   Nationwide
homeschool networks have proven to be very effective avenues of
communication.  The Home School Legal Defense Association, located
outside of Washington, D.C., disseminates regular alerts calling
homeschoolers to action when threats to their -- and everyone's
-- freedom arise.
<p>
Bill and Mary Pride and their nine children are the epitome of
a fully engaged homeschooling family.  Ranging from toddlers to
teens, the kids are all taught at home and always have been. 
The Pride children's educational package takes advantage of everything
from traditional material to on-line computer classes.  To share
their good news in education, the Prides publish a quarterly magazine
called <i>Practical Homeschooling</i> with 96 pages of suggestions
for networking, critiques of curriculum and software, discussions
of educational theories and lighthearted openness about the joys
and trials of the homeschooling life.  Mary does much of the writing
herself and also gathers articles from some of the most staunchly
conservative education thinkers in the nation, including Samuel
Blumenfeld and Doug Wilson.  <I>Practical Homeschooling</I> now
has an on-line site of its own which includes forums for Q &amp;
A on homeschooling pragmatics and on-line chats with contributing
authors.
<p>
<center><h3>THE RETURN OF CLASSICAL EDUCATION</h3></center>
<p>
Truly a timeless educational philosophy, classical education has
now hit cyberspace and become the subject of much chatting in
homeschool online forums.  The resurgence of this medieval model
of education is due in large part to Douglas Wilson, author of
<I>Recovering the Lost Tools of Learning.</I>  His title refers
to the essay which inspired his efforts, entitled, &quot;The Lost
Tools of Learning,&quot; by Dorothy Sayers.  Miss Sayers' 1947
critique of education stall efforts in an apt commentary on America's
system of public education in the '90s:
<p><blockquote>
We dole out lip-service to the importance of education -- lip-service
and, just occasionally, a little grant of money; we postpone the
school-leaving age, and plan to build bigger and better schools;
the teachers slave conscientiously in and out of school hours;
and yet, as I believe, all this devoted effort is largely frustrated,
because we have lost the tools of learning, and in their absence
can only make a botched and piecemeal job of it.[5]
</blockquote><p>
What she goes on to describe as &quot;the lost tools of learning&quot;
are the disciplines of Grammar, Logic, and Rhetoric.  These are
the tools with which students must be equipped, she argues, in
order to tackle the content of any subject.  Sayers considers
Latin an important learning tool as well.  As the key to so many
languages, to the vocabulary of science, and to historical documents,
she estimates that in most subject areas, a knowledge of Latin
would cut learning time by half.  The study of Latin, and not
the &quot;dumbing down&quot; of the test, may prove to be the
surest way to recoup lost ground on the verbal section of the
SAT.
<p>
The contemporary relevance of Miss Sayers' insights is astonishing.
 While federal bureaucrats set a National Education Goal that
all our children will start school ready to learn, Sayers points
out that children are by nature sponges ready to absorb information.
 For those who disparage memorization and the accumulation of
factual knowledge, she points out that young children love litanies
of information.  She gives a whole new meaning to age appropriateness,
a topic of great discussion in the teaching colleges, by tying
Grammar, Logic, and Rhetoric to a child's stages of mental development.
 And how about Latin, as Sayers suggests, for early childhood
education?  &quot;The Lost Tools of Learning&quot; ought to be
required reading in every teacher education class; it cuts through
the confusion and inconsistencies of modern educational theory.
 Sayers' vision is idealistic yet practical; it has the power
to inspire and the wisdom to work.
<p>
Doug Wilson has demonstrated that effectiveness.  Fourteen years
ago he founded Logos School, a distinctively Christian school
based on the Sayers' model of classical education.  Today there
are some thirty member schools in his Association of Classical
and Christian Schools (ACCS).   &quot;These schools are engaged
in what might be one of the most important educational reforms
of our time,&quot; writes Dr. Gene Veith, Dean of Arts and Sciences
at Concordia University.[6] Dr. Veith is in the midst of a year-long
study of classical education.  While modern education disintegrates,
notes Dr. Veith, these classical schools are &quot;recovering
the very approach to education that gave birth to Western civilization
and has continually brought that civilization to renewal.&quot;
 The re-popularization of classical education is timely indeed.
<p>
<center><h3>THE GREAT BOOKS</h3></center>
<p>
While equipping students with grammar, logic, and rhetoric, classical
education focuses on the great literary works of Western civilization,
something modern schools do less and less as contemporary books
replace the old.  The neglect of great books in the schools is
a symptom of a wider cultural trend, as evidenced by the disappearance
of classics from many libraries across the nation.  The Family
Research Council study, &quot;Discarded Images:  Selected Classics
and American Libraries,&quot; by Charles Donovan and William Spont,
documents this phenomenon.
<p>
Large tomes of collected works with ancient bindings may intimidate
the modern reader, but C.S. Lewis argues that old books are not
merely for the expert, but especially for the ordinary reader:
<p><blockquote>
[I]f the average student wants to find out something about Platonism,
the very last thing he thinks of doing is to take a translation
of Plato off the library shelf and read the <I>Symposium</I>.
 He would rather read some dreary modern book ten times as long,
all about 'isms' and influences and only once in twelve pages
telling him what Plato actually said....  But if he only knew,
the great man, just because of his greatness, is much more intelligible
than this modern commentator....  It has always therefore been
one of my main endeavours as a teacher to persuade the young that
first-hand knowledge is not only more worth acquiring than second-hand
knowledge, but is usually much easier and more delightful to acquire.[7]
</blockquote><p>
In contrast, Lewis advises the ordinary reader to take up the
old books &quot;precisely because he is an amateur and therefore
much less protected than the expert against the dangers of an
exclusive contemporary diet.  A new book is still on its trial
and the amateur is not in a position to judge it.&quot;[8] Classical
education has taken the precaution of going back to the revered
classics.
<p>
<center><h3>NEW CONCLUSIONS FROM OLD PRINCIPLES</h3></center>
<p>
While homeschool and classical education may be perceived as eccentric,
esoteric, and even impractical because of their intense pursuit
of &quot;intellectualism,&quot; they are actually thoroughly pragmatic.
 Both models guide students through the learning process efficiently
and deliberately.  The educational sequence is logical and meaningful.
 Meanwhile, we continue to fund a modern public school system
that measures hours spent in school (&quot;seat time&quot;), where
the curriculum is so disjointed that classroom teachers are hard
pressed to answer students' question, &quot;Why do we have to
learn this?&quot;  Convoluted attempts to standardize and individualize
simultaneously have resulted in a dysfunctional system.
<p>
The traditional methods espoused by homeschooling and classical
education strike just the balance the public school system lacks.
 They hold a universally high standard of excellence, and an inherent
standardization which comes from keeping educationally on-task.
 Yet the homeschool and classical models are also much more individualized
than the public school classroom, not only on the basis of size,
but also in personal attention to the development of each child's
mind.  While in the modern system the outcome is paramount, in
classical education and homeschooling the process is just as important
as the end.
<p>
Classical education and homeschooling recognize that different
students have varying strengths, and that each student should
be strengthened in all domains.  Where public education has gradually
excluded certain subjects (art, music, logic, etc.) from the core
curriculum and advised teachers to cater to all learning styles
in the remaining subjects, homeschool and classical education
have embraced the classical liberal arts which train students
in the whole spectrum of knowledge.  A student may excel in one
area and struggle in another, but he will grow in all.
<p>
Leaders of public education would do well to take cues from their
competitors.  Commitment to the system, however, continues to
prevent many from recognizing potentials for renewal. Consequently,
significant overhaul of the public school system may be the only
remedy.  As Doug Wilson notes, this is exactly what William Bennett,
former Secretary of Education, suggested after the Governors'
education summit in 1989, which initiated the America 2000/Goals
2000 agenda:
<p><blockquote>
I'd give the education reform movement another five years.  If
we're not able to get our schools back to where they were in 1963,
after spending 40 percent more, then maybe we should just declare
bankruptcy, give the people back their money, and let them start
their own schools.  That would be a radical way to have accountability.[9]
</blockquote><p>
Time's up.   The people have started their own schools and they
have already outdone the public school system.   We want our money
back.

GOOD FOR FAMILIES</h2>

<center><h3>CURRENT HEALTH CARE SITUATION</h3></center>
<p>
Last year's historic health care debate proved -- to the surprise
of no one but the Clinton Administration -- that American families
will not tolerate federal bureaucrats or &quot;gatekeepers&quot;
in Washington dictating their medical services and choice of doctors.
  A government-run, &quot;one size <I>must </I>fit all&quot; health
policy violates Americans' fundamental principles of freedom.
<p>
An overwhelming majority (roughly 85 percent) of small businesses
provide health insurance for their employees but they should not
be <I>forced</I> to pay for them through a federal mandate, as
Clinton's plan would have required.  A government mandate costs
wages and jobs in the long run and is not the way to reform health
care or help the uninsured population. 
<p>
While employer-provided health benefits may address the problem
of health care &quot;access,&quot;  they do not address the problem
of rising health care costs, which everyone agrees needs to be
addressed.  The national debate on health care reform debunked
the &quot;Washington knows best&quot; philosophy in favor of innovative
state and free-market health care initiatives.  At the forefront
of free-market reform is the concept of medical savings accounts
(also known as MSAs, Medisave accounts, or Medical IRAs).  They
are the centerpiece of the Republicans' health care plan and have
proved popular with the 2,000 private companies that now have
them.  The basic premise is that MSAs empower consumers to make
their own decisions about spending on routine health care, choose
their own doctors, and save unspent account funds from year to
year to pay for future health or retirement needs.  By contrast,
the present &quot;third-party payer&quot; system offers no incentive
to spend wisely because someone else -- the government or private
insurance --  is paying the bill. 
<p>
This year, a bipartisan Congressional proposal to make MSAs tax
free (like traditional health insurance) has 130 cosponsors and
prospects for passage are good.  Congressional Republicans have
advocated MSAs as a potential cost-saving measure for Medicare
recipients as well.
<p>
<I>This year $1 trillion was spent on health care, accounting
for one-seventh of the nation's entire economy</I>.  As costs
rise, consumers pay higher premiums for their health insurance.
 For the most part, consumers are spending the money of a third
party -- the insurance company or government.  When this is the
case, common sense shows that consumers will not spend frugally
or wisely.  Why should they?   Former Surgeon General C. Everett
Koop likened the present third-party payer system to this:  The
government invites people to pick out a new car, charge it to
a card they issue, and then pays the bill.  The problem with this
system is that no one buys a Hyundai.  They all buy Cadillacs
and BMWs.
<p>
Our present health care system discourages competition and cost-consciousness
because, unlike car insurance, the consumer does not see the bill
or, for the most part, use his own money to pay for services.
 Therefore, there is no incentive to shop for lower-cost medical
care.  The administrative costs of processing insurance claims
for the majority of employers account for up to 35 percent of
total premium costs, and average 25 percent of premium costs for
the majority of employers.
<p>
This is the case because traditional indemnity/health insurance
plans tend to stipulate a low-deductible (out-of-pocket) amount
of $100-$250.  In other words, once the consumer has paid the
first $250 out of pocket for his family's medical care, the insurance
begins to pay.  That seems like a good deal but it is very expensive
in the long run because of high administrative costs and the lack
of cost-consciousness that the third-party payment system instills.
<p>
It would make better economic sense for businesses or individuals
to purchase a &quot;high-deductible&quot; health insurance plan
(which costs less in monthly premiums), combined with an MSA for
health care expenses below the deductible level.  (This type of
arrangement, however, does not enjoy equitable tax treatment under
current law.)  The Business Coalition for Affordable Health Care
estimates that approximately 10 percent of Americans spend <I>more
than</I> $2,000 per year on medical expenses.  A March/April 1994
<I>Journal of American Health Policy</I> study (using 1994 dollars)
of one million Americans showed that one-third of the population
filed no claims in 1989; 73 percent filed $500 or less in claims;
82 percent filed  $1,000 or less; and 89 percent filed $2,000
or less.  &quot;In other words, if this group had a $2,000 deductible
MSA, only 11 percent would have reached the deductible,&quot;
the editors noted.  An MSA empowers consumers to pay for routine
medical expenses from their account and to keep the unspent funds
for future health care needs, thus creating incentives for shopping
around and wise spending.  Medical expenditures from the MSAs
are applied against the deductible until the deductible (out-of-pocket
expense) is met, at which point the insurance coverage begins.
<p>
<center><h3>PRIVATE COMPANIES UTILIZE MSAs</h3></center>
<p>
Because of these positive features, more than 2,000 large and
small companies have begun offering MSAs to their employees, with
great success, even though current federal law does not exempt
contributions to such accounts.   Interestingly, seven states
have achieved tax fairness in their state income tax codes by
exempting contributions to MSAs.
<p>
A March 1995 Cato Institute study analyzed several companies and
states that provide MSAs, noting dramatic cost-savings and improvement
in customer satisfaction.  Consider these two examples:
<p><blockquote>
Dramatic savings from using MSAs have also been achieved at Windham
Hospital in Willimantic, Conn., with 1,000 employees.  In 1993
the hospital switched from a pure first-dollar coverage plan with
no deductible or co-payments to a plan with a $500 deductible.
 It also contributes $10 per week, or $520 per year, to an MSA
for each worker.  In addition, the hospital negotiated discounts
for its employees when they pay for health services with MSA funds.
 The hospital itself offers discounts of 30 percent, area doctors
offer price reductions of 20 percent, and drugstores cut prices
by 10 percent.
<p>
Under the old plan, the hospital's employees used medical services
35 percent more than the community average.  After one year under
the new plan, however, the entire 35 percent excess was eliminated.
 Moreover, projected health costs for the hospital employees were
reduced by about 50 percent.
<p></blockquote>
The study even cites the case of The United Mine Workers Union
that successfully negotiated for MSAs in their contract. 
<p><blockquote>
Under an agreement with the Bituminous Coal Operators Association,
covering about 15,000 employees, coal mine operators now provide
workers insurance with a $1,000 deductible replacing a zero deductible
under the old health plan.  The employees are each provided a
$1,000 cash bonus at the beginning of the year that they can use
for health care expenses below the deductible.  At the end of
the year, workers can keep for any use whatsoever any portion
of the bonus they do not use for health care.
<p></blockquote>
<center><h3>HELP FOR LOWER-INCOME FAMILIES</h3></center>
<p>
Companies that have MSAs have found they are most popular among
lower-income employees.  Under conventional insurance plans, low-income
employees would have to meet their $250 or $500 deductible with
after-tax dollars before they could access their insurance.  A
single mother earning $14,000 or $15,000 a year may find it difficult
to meet the deductible when rent, transportation, taxes, grocery
bills and other needs for her children are pressing.  An MSA allows
these low-income earners first dollar coverage, permitting them
to get medical care when they or their children need it.  This
feature alone could significantly reduce the level of emergency
room utilization for non-emergency care.  Low-income wage earners
would have, in effect, first-dollar coverage for medical care
up to the amount in their MSA.
<p>
<center><h3>LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS IN CONGRESS</h3></center>
<p>
Congress has proposed several variations of MSA legislation, but
generally this legislation has been designed to end the current
tax discrimination against MSAs.  MSAs are flexible and would
operate as a <I>tax-free</I>, portable account which can be used
to pay medical bills (including those for eyeglasses and dental
care), in conjunction with a high-deductible (or &quot;catastrophic&quot;)
health insurance plan.  Contributions made by employers, the self-employed
or individuals would be tax-free.  If one needs to withdraw money
for non-medical expenses, the funds are taxed and a 10 percent
penalty applies.
<p>
MSA proposals have gained bipartisan support but have never passed
in Congress.  Now, the 104th Congress has the chance to pass an
MSA bill, such as the Family Medical Savings and Investment Act
of 1995, H.R. 1818, introduced by Reps. Bill Archer (R-Texas)
and Andrew Jacobs (D-Ind.).  This bill allows contributions made
to MSAs by employers, the self-employed, and individuals to be
tax-deductible.  Through tax fairness, the bill also helps the
uninsured, future senior citizens, and employed mothers, who will
no longer be forced to accept full-time employment to receive
tax-deductible health coverage.  The estimated cost of H.R. 1818
is $1.77 billion over seven years, according to the Joint Committee
on Taxation.  Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) recently introduced
a virtually  identical MSA proposal in the Senate, S. 1247. 
<p>
Under H.R. 1818 and S. 1247, there are annual limits on the amount
of money that can be placed in such accounts ($2,500 for an individual
or $5,000 for a family).  A 10 percent penalty is levied if the
money is withdrawn for non-medical expenses.  In addition, money
for non-medical expenses is also taxed as income, since the money
was deposited tax free.  As in the case of IRAs, a 10 percent
penalty would encourage savings and discourage frivolous non-medical
spending. 
<p>
The MSA is essentially a trust created exclusively for the purpose
of paying qualified medical expenses (QME) of the account holder
and his or her family.   Distributions for QMEs are excluded from
gross income.  QMEs are defined by section 213 (d) of the IRS
code, except that MSA expenses for insurance premiums other than
catastrophic plans or long-term care insurance premiums would
not be included.
<p>
H.R. 1818 has passed the House Ways and Means Committee and will
be included in the budget reconciliation package for consideration
under &quot;closed rules&quot; on the House floor.  That means
no amendments may be offered.  The reconciliation bill is an omnibus
&quot;must-pass&quot; budget package slated for a vote in October.
<p>

this policy.
</pre><p>
<ul>
<li>In  S. 1247, the amount of deposit is limited to the deductible
amount of the insurance policy or $2,500 for an individual or
$5,000 for a family.
<p>
<li>If this is used up in a year, the traditional or catastrophic
insurance plan kicks in. 
<p>
<li>If this is not used up in a year, the remainder can be retained
in the MSA to be used for next year's health expenses, or future
retirement (IRA) needs.
<p>
<li>Long-term care insurance policies can be purchased from the
MSA account.
<p>
<li>People laid-off or unemployed can use MSA funds to continue
to purchase high-deductible private health insurance.
</ul><p>
Let's say an employer, for example, will spend $4,000 per year
on health insurance for an individual.  The employer decides to
use that $4,000 for an MSA for his employee.  The employer purchases
a high-deductible insurance policy which costs $2,000 per year.
 The policy has a deductible of $2,500.  The employer then deposits
$2,000 into the MSA, from which the employee draws to meet routine
medical expenses.  Therefore, as an equation, the example above
would look like this: 
<p>
<center>
$4,000  =  $2,000 in premium costs for a health insurance policy<br>
with a $2,500 deductible  +  $2,000 deposited in the MSA
</center><p>
Next year, the employer deposits another $2,000 (usually in monthly
allotments) in the employee's MSA.  If the employee only spent
$1,000 the first year, then the employee would have $1,000 left
in the MSA at the beginning of the second year, when that year's
$2,000 would be deposited.  Therefore, the employee would have
$3,000 in the MSA at the beginning of the second year.  
<p>
Once initially set up, an MSA is useful in times of temporary
unemployment or in-between jobs.  The same <I>Journal of American
Health Policy</I> (cited above) reports that &quot;41 percent
of persons losing private health insurance have an uninsured spell
that ends within one to three months, and 71 percent have a dry
spell that ends within four months.&quot;   The &quot;portable&quot;
feature of  MSAs can prevent &quot;job lock&quot; - that is, a
situation in which someone feels &quot;forced&quot; to remain
in a job because of fear of losing good health benefits.   Those
unfortunate families who are chronically unemployed or earning
wages below the poverty level, will still be eligible for public
health programs, such as Medicaid and SSI, which will continue
to provide aid to the working poor.
<p>
<center><h3>TYPICAL FEATURES OF  H.R. 1818/S. 1247:</h3></center>
<p><ul>
<I>* tax free account, similar to IRA, for medical expenses</I><br>
<I>* employer or individual makes contribution (limit $)</I><br>
<I>* choose own doctor</I><br>
<I>* portable </I><br>
<I>* money in account rolls over year to year </I><br>
<I>* no claims, no new government bureaucracy or administrative
costs</I><br>
<I>* can withdraw savings for retirement at 59 1/2 years old</I><br>
<I>* 10 percent penalty for withdrawal for non-medical use</I><br>
<p></ul>
<center><h3>MEDICARE</h3></center>
<p>
As one possible alternative to Medicare, both House and Senate
committees have proposed  tax-free &quot;Medisave&quot; accounts,
similar to those proposed for working families, as a potential
option for seniors.  In the future, these Medisave accounts have
the potential to save seniors and the health care system money
by allowing personal account funds to be used to pay for expenses
not covered by the traditional health insurance plan, such as
prescription drugs or long-term care insurance premiums.   If
the money is spent wisely, there will be money left in the account
for next year's health expenses or for non-medical expenses (with
a small penalty).  This will help give the elderly and their families
an opportunity to best use the money.  It takes decisions away
from the Washington bureaucrats.  The House Ways and Means and
Senate Finance Committees have approved a medical savings account
option that combines a high-deductible insurance policy with a
Medicare MSA.   
<p>
<center><h3>SUMMARY</h3></center>
<p>
FRC believes Medical Savings Accounts are family-friendly health
care reform.  Ultimately, all health care reform legislation should
be judged within the following family-based guidelines:  
<p><ul>
<li>Fosters Genuine Compassion
<li>Makes Prudence Pay
<li>Promotes Family Autonomy
<li>Recognizes the Family's Contribution to Good Health
<li>Empowers Families to Act
<p></ul>

<h2>YOUTH GANGS: OUT OF<br>
CONTROL AND GETTING<br>
WORSE</h2>

<p>
A recent decline in violent crime appears to be more a result
of fewer teenagers than better law enforcement.  When the current
bumper crop of elementary-age children become adolescents, the
violent crime rate is likely to explode.
<p>
A growing chorus of experts warn of the impending youth crime
crisis.  Reggie Walton, a Washington, D.C. Superior Court judge
who handles juvenile cases, blames it on the disappearance of
fathers.  Walton says fathers leave children to be raised by young
mothers who themselves are often struggling with mental or emotional
problems, limited education, poverty and addiction.  Walton labels
these children &quot;walking time bombs.&quot;[1]
<p>
This time bomb has been in the making for some time.  Youth violent
crime has been rising dramatically for more than a decade.  Today,
and historically, young males commit far more crimes than other
age groups.
<p>
The volatile mix of more chronic juvenile delinquents and an upward
surge in youthful perpetrators of violence is complemented by
an unprecedented growth in youth living with little or no adult
supervision.  Consider some recent examples.
<p><ul>
<li>A Los Angeles family takes a wrong turn into gang territory
and is fired upon.  A 3-year-old is killed and her 2-year-old
brother wounded.
<p><li>A Chinese immigrant in Brooklyn is kidnapped by a Chinatown
gang which demands ransom payments from her family.  She is murdered
when the family fails to pay.
<p><li>Two FBI agents and a police sergeant are murdered inside the
Washington, D.C. police headquarters by a gang member.
<p><li>A Pittsburgh police sergeant walking home with his daughter
is killed with his own gun after he stops and confronts a gang
spraying graffiti on a street.
</ul><p>
<center><h3>WALKING TIME BOMBS</h3></center>
<p>
Vice President Albert Gore recently told the White House press
corps, &quot;Gangs have been a major cause of the growth in violent
crime in the past decade.&quot;[2] He cited a Treasury Department
report that found the presence of rival gangs, the Bloods and
the Crips, in 35 states and 58 cities across the country.
<p>
At the same press conference, Attorney General Janet Reno cited
the impact of disabling one gang in New Haven, Connecticut.  Eighteen
members of the &quot;Jungleboy&quot; street gang were put in jail,
and, according to Reno, New Haven's murder rate fell by one-third
in 1993.[3]
<p>
Given that youth gangs account for a disproportionate share of
youth violence, their potential for contributing to a future crime
wave is enormous.
<p>
At the current growth rate, there will be nearly half-a-million
more adolescent boys in the year 2010 than today.  That means
if current trends continue, we will have perhaps 30,000 more chronic
juvenile delinquents by the year 2010 than today.  Chronic youth
offenders comprise 7 percent of all male teenagers and they commit
70 percent of all serious crime for their age group.[4]
<p>
If history is any predictor, these adolescents will be more violent
than the current delinquents.  According to the Department of
Justice, today's youth are extremely violent.  Firearms are now
used by three-fourths of all juvenile homicide offenders and 
one-third of all reported violent crime offenders are less than
21 years old.  Juvenile arrests for all violent crime have increased
from 1983 to 1992 in spite of the decline in the overall number
of teenagers in the U.S. population.  The government estimates
that the juvenile arrest rate for major violent crime will more
than double by the year 2010.[5]
<p>
This ticking youth time bomb is evident everywhere.  California
authorities report that incarcerations of violent youth increased
from 44 percent of the prison population in 1987 to 61 percent
in 1992[6]. There is no sign of a turnaround.  Officials in the
upscale Washington, D.C. suburb of Fairfax, Virginia, report that
the number of juveniles arrested for violent crimes has climbed
61 percent since 1991.  The number of youth arrested with weapons
has risen 118 percent since 1989.[7]
<p>
A 1993 report by the Washington State Department of Community
Development states, &quot;Our state and nation are awash in a
tidal wave of violence, violence that has reached epidemic proportions
especially among our youngest generation.&quot;[8]
<p>
Professor Dean Rojek, a sociologist at the University of Georgia,
says, &quot;For decades violent crime was driven mostly by adults,
with kids involved mostly in property crime....What's been changing is 
that you have juveniles becoming much more involved in violent offenses, 
with the use of weapons. If we add to this more babies, you could have a 
multiplier effect...a mini explosion [in violent crime by youth].&quot;[9]
<p>
Attorney General Janet Reno agrees.  &quot;Unless we act now,&quot;
says Reno, &quot;to stop young people from choosing a life of
violence and crime, the beginning of the 21st century could bring
levels of violent crime to our community that far exceed what
we have experienced.&quot;[10]
<p>
<center><h3>GANGS EXACERBATE THE PROBLEM</h3></center>
<p>
The bomb's fuse is shortened by the youth gang phenomenon.  California
authorities describe the youth gang as a &quot;violent and insidious
new form of organized crime.  Heavily armed with sophisticated
weapons, (gangs) are involved in drug trafficking, witness intimidation,
extortion, and bloody territorial wars.  In some cases they are
traveling out of state to spread their violence and crime.&quot;[11]
<p>
According to the FBI,  &quot;The fastest growing murder circumstance
is juvenile gang killings.&quot;[12] Almost one-third of Los Angeles'
homicides are gang related.[13] Nationwide, the rate of violent offenses
by gang members is three times as high as for non-gang delinquents.[14]
<p>
There's something about young males belonging to a gang that makes
them more violent.
<p><ul>
<li>Orange County, California probation statistics indicate that
gang-related youth had significantly higher law-violation rates (55.1 percent) 
than non-gang affiliated youth (26.4 percent).[15] A study of 20 years of 
data collected by Philadelphia's police gang unit shows that &quot;gangs
engage in more violent behavior than do delinquent non-gang groups.&quot;[16]
<p>
<li>Metropolitan Life surveyed schools about gang violence.  It
found that more than half (59 percent) of law enforcement and one-third (34 
percent) of students and teachers say gang or group membership is a major
cause of violence in schools.[17]
<p>
<li>A study in Wisconsin found that most violent crimes by youths
were committed by groups of three or more.  This &quot;pack&quot; behavior, 
not surprisingly, seems to be at the core of much of the rise in youth
crime.[18]
<p>
<li>A study of New York City teenage gunshot victims found that
40 percent were shot during school hours.  Another study found that of 
children and teenagers wounded in drive-by shootings in Los Angeles, 71 
percent were &quot;documented members of street gangs.&quot;[19]
<p></ul>
Not only do gang members tend to be more violent than non-gang
members, but gang membership appears to prolong one's criminal
career.  One study found that a &quot;large portion of persistent
and dangerous juvenile gang offenders become even more serious
adult offenders.&quot;[20] Another study in California found that
previously-incarcerated gang members continued their lives of
crime after being released.[21]
<p>
<center><h3>GANGS - AN AMERICAN PHENOMENON?</h3></center>
<p>
As early as the 1600s, London was &quot;terrorized by a series
of organized gangs...[who] fought pitched battles among themselves
dressed with colored ribbons to distinguish the different factions.&quot;[22]
 Gang problems have been reported in most of Europe, the former
Soviet Union, Africa, South America, Mexico, New Zealand and Japan.
<p>
One of the first reports of youth gangs in America comes from
Philadelphia.  In 1791, that city's leaders convened a conference
to decide how to deal with bands of disruptive youth.[23]
<p>
New York City had a similar problem in the 19th century.  New
York's gangs tended to be political agents for the Know Nothing
or Native American Party.  During the early Civil War years there
were draft riots which may have been started by Irish street gangs.[24]
<p>
The classic movie, <I>West Side Story</I>, is stereotypical of
20th century gang life.  The Sharks and the Jets are territorial
gangs protecting their neighborhoods.  Until recently, however,
gangs like these were not considered a threat to the general population.
<p>
Neither a 1967 presidential commission on law enforcement nor
the 1976 National Advisory Committee on Criminal Standards and
Goals foresaw today's gang problem. They concluded, &quot;Youth
gangs are not now or [sic] should not become a major object of
concern....Youth gang violence is not a major problem in the United
States....What gang violence does exist can fairly readily be
diverted into 'constructive' channels, especially through the
provision of services by community agencies.&quot;[25]
<p>
<center><h3>WHY ARE GANGS SPREADING?</h3></center>
<p>
Gangs are spreading across the country and are not just limited
to major cities.  Bernard Friedlander, a University of Hartford psychology 
professor and a violence expert, says, &quot;This is an American problem, 
not an inner-city problem....It's spreading slowly....On one level it's 
simple fad imitation...but on another level the
isolation of youth is just as profound in some of the more stable
areas as in the inner city.&quot;[26]
<p>
Ed Edelman, a Los Angeles supervisor, said, &quot;Gangs are very
mobile today.  They don't just stay in one area.  They are not just limited 
to poor areas of the country.  They are all over the place.&quot;[27]
<p>
The spread of gangs can be attributed to at least three factors.
 First, parents, desiring to protect their gang-culture-saturated
children from the hometown gang's influence, send them to relatives
across the country.  Sometimes this strategy works.  But many
times it merely helps transplant the gang culture into a new community.
<p>
The drug trade has created entrepreneurial gangs which fan out
across the country to ply their trade and expand their markets.
 Franchises of the Bloods and the Crips are now in most metropolitan
centers.  With their expansion, they have introduced collateral,
gang-like violence.
<p>
Finally, the entertainment industry contributes to the spread
of gangs.  The gang culture, value system and mentality are sprinkled
across the country through movies, &quot;gangsta&quot; rap music
and now comic books.  These cultural amplifiers educate young
audiences to gang values and attitudes.  They denigrate women,
promote exaggerated manhood or  &quot;machismo,&quot; and glorify
violence.  They also pass on gang language, symbols, activities,
and traditions.[28]
<p>
<center><h3>GANG NUMBERS, LOCATION AND TYPES</h3></center>
<p>
According to Justice Department estimates, the United States has
some 1,436 gangs and 120,636 gang members.  They exist in large,
mid-sized and small communities and in suburban areas.[29]
<p>
The Justice Department figures are disputed by the National School
Safety Center, which in 1993 estimated that the Los Angeles area
alone has at least 959 gangs with approximately 125,000 gang members.[30]
 Another report states that more than 350,000 gang members reside
along the West Coast.[31] To further confuse the issue, a 1975 study
found a total of 760 to 2,700 gangs in the nation's eight largest
cities.[32]
<p>
There are many types of gangs.  Some are black, white, Asian,
Hispanic or other ethnic-centered gangs.  Others are structured
around territory, commercial activities, corporate businesses,
political agendas, religion, music and special types of crime.
<p><ul>
<li><B>Race/ethnic-based gangs</B>:  Larry Rawles, deputy director
of Philadelphia's Crisis Intervention Network, says, &quot;When any ethnic 
group was at the bottom, they formed gangs -- the Jews, the Irish, the 
Italians.&quot;[33] Gangs offered status, a sense of self-worth, 
and protection.  Today, most gangs are racially segregated (54.6
percent are African American and 32.6 percent are Hispanic).  Blacks and 
Hispanics constitute the largest numbers of youths arrested for gang 
offenses today.[34]
<p>
The all-black rival gangs, the Crips and the Bloods, have an estimated
70,000 members in Los Angeles County alone.[35] They have franchises
in most states and metropolitan communities where they tend to
dominate the crack cocaine trade.
<p>
Darlyne Pettinicchio, a probation officer in Orange County, California,
says, &quot;(White gangs are) punk rockers and heavy metalers
(who) come from all socio-economic classes.  They're of average
intelligence and they're capable youngsters.  They have very little
parental authority.  They're usually angry.  Their dance is violent.
 Their music is violent.  Their behavior is violent.  They're
into anarchy.&quot;[36]
<p>
There are numerous Hispanic, Satanic cult, Asian, and Stoner (punk
rock and heavy metal) gangs.  Each has a subculture and each tends
to be very violent and involved in the use and or distribution
of illicit drugs.
<p>
<li><B>Economic-based gangs</B>:  Some gangs are organized around
a commercial activity. Members may be all from a single race or the same 
neighborhood or they may be very diverse.  The glue that holds them together
is making money.
<p>
They often see themselves as Robin Hoods or Bonnie-and-Clyde types
who practice their own version of free enterprise.  A close cousin
is the corporate gang, which selects a type of industry or business
and dominates the field through intimidation and violence.   For
example, there was a Miami-based gang called the &quot;Mazda boys&quot;
who specialized in stealing Mazda cars.
<p>
<li><B>Territorial gangs</B>:  Territorial gangs can be from any
race or ethnic background. They lay claim to a particular territory. They 
typically &quot;tag&quot; their territory with gang graffiti and are 
willing to defend their turf to the death. When their territory is invaded 
the gang provides &quot;warriors.&quot;
<p></ul>
<center><h3>WHO JOINS A GANG?</h3></center>
<p>
No matter the type of gang, most gang members are male.  A Chicago
study of four police districts found that only 2 to 5 percent
of gang arrestees were female.[37] These females are typically auxiliary
gang members.
<p>
Gang members range in age from 8 to 22 years old, but there are
exceptions where tenure is often well beyond 22 to perhaps more
than 40 years old.[38] A counselor in a juvenile detention facility
in California said: &quot;(If) you find a gang member who comes
from a complete nuclear family, a kid who has never been exposed
to any kind of abuse, I'd like to meet him....a real 'gangbanger'
who comes from a happy, balanced home, who's got a good opinion
of himself.  I don't think that kid exists.&quot;[39]
<p>
Sydney Harris, a nationally syndicated columnist, said, &quot;Gang
members tend to be chronic losers, who can accomplish nothing
individually, or who live in so depressed an environment that
only by banding together can they exercise any influence over
their lives.  In both cases, they are as much to be pitied as
condemned.&quot;[40]
<p>
Allen Frazier, superintendent of schools for Plymouth, Connecticut,
blames economic problems.  &quot;As people have more economic
problems in the adult world,&quot; says Frazier, &quot;it transfers
to the young people as well....[The children] don't seem to have
a place where they are comfortable.  In order to seek that, sometimes
they end up with the security of a gang....It becomes an extended
family which they may not have.&quot;[41]
<p>
A gang researcher says, &quot;These gang kids have nothing to
do that they perceive as useful.  They are the disconnected, alienated
ones.  They identify with whatever is trendy in terms of music,
clothes, and in terms of behavior.  They are living entirely on
the surface of life.&quot;[42]
<p>
Prisons are often referred to as gang training schools.  Often
gangs are formed in prison and then emigrate to the streets. 
The cohesion associated with jail time amplifies gang loyalty.
<p>
Fred Williams, the executive director for Common Ground Foundation,
a Watts [Los Angeles, California] nonprofit organization that
works with gang youth, says, &quot;Prison doesn't scare them.
 It's a home away from home.&quot;[43]
<p>
<center><h3>GANG CULTURE</h3></center>
<p>
Professor Cornel West, a Princeton University social scholar,
says in his book <I>Race Matters</I> that the nihilistic thinking
of the inner city black community sets the stage for gang formation.
 West says, &quot;The frightening result is a numbing detachment
from others and a self-destructive disposition toward the world.
 Life without meaning, hope, and love breeds a cold-hearted, mean-spirited
outlook that destroys both the individual and others.&quot;[44]
<p>
The youth gang satisfies a void.  It provides the child a sense
of identity, belonging, power, and protection.  The gang satisfies
the child's desire to feel secure.  Living in a high-risk environment
without paternal protection, the young gangster satisfies his
insecurities by aligning himself with a gang, his surrogate family.
 The gang provides a protective barrier against the outside forces.
<p>
One gang member says, &quot;Being in a gang means if I didn't
have no family, I think that's where I'll be.  If I didn't have
no job that's where I'd be.  To me it's community help without
all the community.  They'll understand better than my mother and
father.&quot;[45]
<p>
His new &quot;family&quot; has a distinct set of values that affect
every aspect of his life.  According to the Los Angeles District
Attorney, the gang culture is radically different from the mainline
culture.  &quot;It confronts and confounds adult authority on
every level -- sex, work, power, love, education, language, dress,
music, drugs, alcohol, violence.  As icons of popular culture,
gangs not only represent a powerful group identity utterly inaccessible
to adults, they are surrounded with an appealing aura of outlaw
danger.&quot;[46]
<p>
Visible manifestations of the gang culture include colors, signs,
symbols, graffiti, and tattoos.  Gang colors, different types
of clothing and head covering help distinguish one gang from another.
 Even some National Football League players who are connected
to gangs wear gang-colored bandanas.
<p>
Gangs often have their peculiar vocabulary.  Many black street
gangs address each other as &quot;cuz&quot; for cousin.  They
often have code words and many speak like &quot;rappers.&quot;
<p>
&quot;Tagging&quot; their territory with gang graffiti is common.
 It proclaims the presence of the gang and offers a challenge
to rivals.  It may claim credit for a crime.  The denser the graffiti,
the closer one is to the gang's core territory.  The Crips often
mark &quot;B/K&quot; for &quot;Bloods killers.&quot;
<p>
Gang behavior is characterized by extreme loyalty.  Members never
inform on &quot;homeboys,&quot; even if faced with death.  Once
in a gang, the member faces long odds of ever leaving alive.
<p>
Captain Russell Holyfield of the Hartford Police Department describes
gang protocol.  &quot;You give someone a dirty look,&quot; says
Holyfield, &quot;or say something about their girlfriend and later
on that day, you're a target.&quot;[47]
<p>
A Los Angeles District Attorney gang study describes the macho-psychology
of the gang culture.  &quot;The gang's ideal man is virtually
identical to the romantic myth of the gunfighter of the Old West
-- a two-fisted, hard-drinking, dangerous man who is quick to
avenge any insult; he lives and dies by violence, with his exploits
rousing fear and respect in the hearts of men, and in the hearts
of women, fear and desire.&quot;[48]
<p>
&quot;Gangsta&quot; rap is filled with messages that glorify violence,
extreme abuse of women and disrespect for authority.  The rapper's
lyrics paint a realistic picture of daily gangster activity.
<p>
Despite this, some gangs have an odd sense of civility.  A Los
Angeles Hispanic gang member says, &quot;When I'm out on the streets,
I know I'm safe if I'm with my mom.  You don't disrespect anybody
if they are with their mom.&quot;[49]
<p>
Partying and fighting, the core activities of a gang, are what
draw many young males.  According to the Los Angeles District
Attorney's report, &quot;These are the things that build and define
group loyalties.  Even criminality, which is probably the public's
main perception of what gangs are about, is less a core value
of the gang than a byproduct of the emphasis on partying and fighting.&quot;[50]
<p>
Sergeant Joe Guzman with the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department
explains prison's influence on the gang culture:  &quot;One prison
gang member might see that another gang member had something he
wanted.  If he was larger, more powerful or had more back-up from
his 'homeboys' than the other inmate, he literally just took the
item he wanted.  If he was angered in one fashion or another he
retaliated with deadly vengeance and commanded the presence of
his entire gang to back him up.&quot;[51]
<p>
<center><h3>GANG ORGANIZATION</h3></center>
<p>
Gangs are loosely organized.  Some are part of larger structures
known as &quot;nations,&quot; which are networked nationwide.
 But most are loosely knit groups with several leaders.
<p>
The 1960 New York City Youth Board proposed a theory of gang structure,
stating gangs are structured both vertically and horizontally.
 The vertical gang is structured along age lines and draws members
from local neighborhoods.  The horizontal gang has older members
who are drawn from a larger area.[52] This type of gang tends to
evolve into coalitions, supergangs and nations.  The term &quot;supergang&quot;
was coined in Chicago in the late 1960s to describe a gang with
thousands of members.[53]
<p>
Virtually every gang is built from groups called &quot;cliques.&quot;
 One gang researcher called the clique a &quot;spontaneous interest
group usually of the conflict type which forms itself within some
larger social structure such as a gang.&quot;[54] Members of cliques
tend to be similar in age.
<p>
Gang leaders are chosen by natural selection based on the person's
age, physical stature, arrest record and behavior.  Like any organization,
according to one researcher, the &quot;ability to get along with
people is one of the basic skills associated with gang leadership.&quot;[55]
<p>
Some gangs have formal leaders known as king, prince, prime minister,
general, don, or chief .  Others are informal, known as &quot;shot
callers&quot; or &quot;shooters.&quot;   Leadership responsibilities
may be shared and based upon a &quot;collection of functions that
may be undertaken at various times by a number of members.&quot;[56]
<p>
<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>
<p>
&quot;We've got so many kids out there who've lost hope, who believe
in only living for today,&quot; says John Turner, chief of police
for the city of Mountlake Terrace, Washington. &quot;They join
a gang and get involved in criminal activity because there aren't
any people taking them by the hand in simple terms and pointing
them in the right direction, giving them self-esteem and positive
feedback.&quot;[57]
<p>
Perhaps gangs exist because modern society has failed to harness
the male hunter/predator instinct and converted those energies
to familial provider/protector efforts.  Delinquent young people
lacking values, conscience or a sense of remorse can easily find
themselves drawn to the gang lifestyle.
<p>
Noted author James Q. Wilson writes in <I>The Moral Sense</I>
that modern society with its &quot;rapid technological change,
intense division of labor, and ambiguous allocation of social
roles, frequently leaves some men out, with their aggressive predispositions
either uncontrolled or undirected.  Gangs are one result.&quot;[58]
<p>
Wilson says the profits from illegal drug sales provide gang members
economic opportunities which combine with their uncontrolled aggression
to develop a &quot;warrior culture that underinvests in family
life.&quot;
<p>
Converting male energy to familial provider/protector efforts
has always been the task of the intact family.  But the nuclear
family is declining, especially in predominantly black inner cities
where gangs dominate life and rain violent crime.  Many of these
children join gangs to find purpose, security, and self-esteem.
 The gang culture gives them a sense of belonging and remakes
their value system.  Partying, fighting, and vicious gang loyalty
become their primary values, thus pushing aside virtues that favor
family life.  This is a vicious cycle and it must be broken.
<p>
Defusing the youth crime bomb must include a strategy to dismantle
the growing youth gang movement.  Gangs are the powder magazine
-- they must be dealt with before the bomb goes off.

<title>CONGRESS MAY FORM A COMMISSION TO STUDY LEGALIZED GAMBLING</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/insight/insight.gif">
<p>
<h2>CONGRESS MAY FORM A<br>
COMMISSION TO STUDY<br>
LEGALIZED GAMBLING</h2>
<hr size = 3 width = 50%>
<p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>Robert L. Maginnis</i></center>
<p>
America is experiencing a wave of legalized gambling. Some consider
government-sponsored betting a financial godsend, but for others
it is a social and economic disaster that will stop only when
the public says enough is enough.
<p>
Gambling has grown in an ad hoc manner with states and cities
emulating others that appear to be successful. Officials look
with envy as citizens go to other states and cities to wager.
But as one politician who led the battle to legalize gambling
in Atlantic City warned, &quot;Casino gambling is not a 'try it
and see' experiment. Once the casino opens and the dice begin
to roll, gambling creates an instant constituency. People depend
on it for jobs. Governments depend on it for revenues.&quot;[1]
<p>
Rep. Frank Wolf (R-Va.) has introduced legislation intended to
discover the true nature of gambling. Wolf's bill, the National
Gambling Impact and Policy Commission Act, calls for the creation
of a two-year commission to study gambling. The Act was approved
by voice vote November 8, 1995, by the House Judiciary Committee
and is expected to see House floor debate in 1996.[2]
<p>
A similar bill has been introduced in the Senate by Paul Simon
(D-Ill.) and Richard Lugar (R-Ind.).[3] The proposed commission will
examine policies and practices with respect to legalization or
prohibition of gambling and make recommendations for legislation
and administrative action.
<p>
This legislation is considered necessary because of the gradual
creation of 37 state lotteries and the expansion of casino gambling
to 23 states (prompted in part by the Indian Gaming Regulatory
Act of 1988) as well as an avalanche of gaming promoters selling
government officials on the economic benefits of legalization.
These sponsors sell legalization as an economic boon and a harmless
recreational pastime, but there is considerable evidence that
this rush to easy money actually costs the taxpayer more than
it harvests.
<p>
Columnist William Safire speaks for many when he labels gambling
&quot;a $40-billion-a-year industry that is inherently immoral,
corrupting public officials, enriching criminals, addicting and
impoverishing the young and the vulnerable.&quot;[4] He supports
the legislation now pending in the 104th Congress.
<p>
According to Congressman Wolf's bill, the proposed federal commission
would consider 11 broad areas. The following summarizes what is
already known about some of these areas.
<p>
<center><h3>ECONOMIC IMPACT</h3></center>
<p>
Tunica County, Mississippi was known as the poorest county in
the country. In January 1992, it had an unemployment rate of 26.2
percent and a per capita income of $11,865. More than half of
its citizens were on food stamps.[5]
<p>
Since legalized gambling came to Tunica County, land values have
skyrocketed from $250 to $25,000 per acre. Over a billion dollars
in building permits have been granted. The nine area casinos each
average 1,000 employees, bringing unemployment down to 4.9 percent.
Child support collections have doubled, welfare benefits have
been nearly halved, food stamp recipients have decreased and property
taxes have been cut one-third.[6]
<p>
Webster Franklin, executive director of the Tunica County chamber
of commerce, is a gambling fan. He told a House committee in September
1995 that gambling is the best thing to happen to his county.
<p>
Such reports cause officials of money-strapped government agencies
to salivate. Detroit, for example, equates casinos with economic
salvation. For years, gambling citizens have crossed the Detroit
River to make wagers in Canada.
<p>
John Kelly, a lawyer and former Michigan state senator who opposed
gambling when he was in the legislature, now works for a local
investment group. He said the presence of Canadian casinos across
the river has been persuasive to him. He wants Detroit to reap
some of the profit from gambling rather than watch locals cross
the border to wager. Michigan Governor John Engler has appointed
an 11-member commission to study whether an Indian-run casino
would benefit the city.[7]
<p>
The story in Mobile, Alabama, is quite different. Mayor Mike Dow
believed that $63 million was spent by Alabama residents at nearby
Gulfport, Mississippi gambling casinos. When Mayor Dow investigated
bringing casinos to his city, he found the price was too high.
<p>
Forty-one of Mobile's social service agency CEO's were tasked
to determine the probable effects of introducing casinos. The
five-month study found that introducing casinos would cost the
city $15 million more each year in increased social service costs.
<p>
Charles White, CEO, Franklin Memorial Health Care Center of Mobile,
said, &quot;Our social service staff is already seeing an impact
from casinos in Mississippi....We see families selling their food
stamps and WIC vouchers for gambling money, and we are aware of
one family who lost its home.&quot;[8]
<p>
Joyce Collier, executive director of Mobile's Family Counseling
Center, states: &quot;[in the Biloxi/Gulfport area] families have
lost everything that they have worked for in terms of physical
holdings....Some clients have pawned car titles and lost transportation....Our
family counselors report increased alcohol and drug abuse and
spouse abuse.&quot;[9]
<p>
In 1994, Florida governor Lawton Chiles sponsored an economic
impact study of gambling. He found that Florida could anticipate
gambling revenues ranging from $324 to $469 million each year,
but that collateral costs outstripped the gain. Sales tax revenues
would drop $84.7 million, and crime and social costs attributable
to casinos were estimated to reach between $2.16 and $3.8 billion
annually.[10]
<p>
University of Nevada professor of public administration William
Thompson explained Florida's dilemma. Casinos generate significant
new tax revenues &quot;only if they can export their product.
The local economy doesn't benefit if only local people are gambling.&quot;[11]
Florida's geography is unlike Atlantic City and Las Vegas, which
draw gamblers from other states and send them packing with the
residue of gambling pathologies. That tab is absorbed by the gamblers'
home states. But Florida believes most of its potential gamblers
would be residents and not out-of-state tourists.
<p>
National gambling expert Robert Goodman studied the industry's
claims of economic benefits for the Ford Foundation and the Aspen
Institute. He says there is a critical lack of objective knowledge
and research about the real economic and social costs and benefits
of legalizing gambling. He warns that the research often used
by public officials tends to be unbalanced because it has been
provided by the gambling industry.[12]
<p>
Goodman's 1994 study analyzed 14 gambling industry studies concluding
that &quot;hiding the costs&quot; of gambling was widespread and
gambling acted as &quot;economic cannibalism&quot; on pre-existing
economies and other businesses.[13]
<p>
John Kindt, a professor of commerce at the University of Illinois,
has estimated that for every dollar that states take in from gambling
they pay three dollars to social agencies and crime fighting.
A problem gambler costs the state an average of $13,000 a year
in social impact.[14]
<p>
<center><h3>IMPACT ON BUSINESS</h3></center>
<p>
Louisiana gambled and is now paying the price. That state legalized
riverboat gambling and a few land-based casinos several years
ago. Recent events show the error of that decision.
<p>
Mike Foster, a Republican who ran on an anti-gambling platform,
was recently elected governor. He promises a state referendum
on gambling's future within a year.[15]
<p>
Additionally, on November 22, 1995 Harrah's Jazz Company, a consortium
that was building a 200,000-square-foot casino on New Orleans's
Canal Street, filed for protection under chapter 11 of the federal
bankruptcy law. This action caused the layoff of 3,500 workers
and a net loss of $23.6 million each year for the city. Why? Because
the temporary casino was doing poorly. Gambling investors miscalculated
the appeal of gambling.[16]
<p>
Gambling is leading many communities into economic distress. Atlantic
City has created 43,000 jobs over 10 years, but now the city has
only one business -- gambling. When casinos first came to Atlantic
City, there were 2,100 thriving small businesses. Today the number
is near 1,100 and falling. According to a New Jersey commission
report, &quot;It is clear that retail business and retail employment
in Atlantic City have continued to decline despite the presence
of gambling, and that rampant speculation has rendered the development
of vast parts of Atlantic City difficult if not impossible.&quot;[17]
<p>
In Illinois it was hoped that an economic facelift would result
when riverboats were introduced. But Earl L. Grinols, a University
of Illinois economist, examined the economic data in April 1994.
He found that &quot;riverboat gambling did not create the jobs
that were promised and had very little effect on reducing unemployment.&quot;[18]
He concluded, &quot;Economically speaking, it appears that riverboat
casinos shift jobs as opposed to creating jobs. For example, the
number of independent restaurants drops when a casino opens up.
Car sales have been known to go down with the onset of gambling.&quot;[19]
<p>
A survey by Chicago's Better Government Association (BGA) of 324
business owners in Illinois' riverboat towns found that a majority
said the floating casinos had no effect or a negative effect on
their businesses. BGA director J. Terrence Brunner said, &quot;Clearly,
riverboat gambling has not met the criteria set forth by Illinois
legislators when they sold this to the citizens of Illinois. The
economic development we found was marginal at best. It has not
spurred economic development. It has not created jobs. It has
not boosted tourism, and it certainly has not brought new life
to Illinois rivers or beautified their banks.&quot;[20]
<p>
Jeffrey Bloomberg, state's attorney, Lawrence County, South Dakota,
told the House Committee on Small Business on September 21, 1995,
that since 1988 when casino gambling was legalized for Deadwood,
South Dakota, life has been a nightmare. Real estate values have
skyrocketed, taxes have risen and gaming revenues have been eaten
up by increased administrative, law enforcement and infrastructure
costs.[21]
<p>
When casino gambling swept into three Colorado towns, it radically
changed life for the worse. According to a 1992 <I>Wall Street
Journal</I> article, &quot;[I]nstead of a few slot machines, full-blown
casinos owned by Las Vegas veterans and real-estate developers
have swept in, swallowing many mom-and-pop businesses along the
way. Water, sewer and traffic systems have been overwhelmed, crime
has increased, non-casino businesses face huge tax increases and
the relative calm of local politics has been shattered.&quot;[22]
<p>
Many communities with gambling experience are discovering the
hollow promises of the sponsors of this get-rich-quick industry.
Gambling creates many low paying jobs, diverts consumer dollars
into gambling, cannibalizes small businesses, and saddles those
that remain with burdensome tax liabilities. Gambling has a cumulative
negative economic impact.[23]
<p>
<center><h3>POLITICS AND PUBLIC POLICY IMPACT</h3></center>
<p>
The gambling industry is sophisticated when it comes to getting
what it wants. Consider the Mashantucket Pequot Indians' gambling
operations in Connecticut.
<p>
Today, the 370-member Pequot tribe operates a 17-story, 1,229-room
hotel and casino facility that draws 50,000 visitors a day. The
facility is managed by Gerald Michael Brown, a former New Jersey
deputy attorney general. Brown recently failed to win state support
to expand Pequot gambling to Bridgeport, a New York City suburb,
but it wasn't for lack of trying.[24]
<p>
Brown hired a law firm for $100,000 a month to prowl the halls
of Connecticut's capitol to sway lawmakers. The Pequot tribe ran
television commercials and sent out direct mail appeals touting
the financial benefits for the taxpayer. The cumulative effort
cost the tribe $13 million over four years. The fact is that the
Pequots contribute more to the state coffers than any single organization.[25]
But in November 1995, the state senate, by a majority of 24-10,
shot down the proposal. Count on a comeback.
<p>
The Pequots are generous on the national scene as well. In 1994,
the tribe contributed $215,000 in soft money to the Democratic
party and $465,000 to the Republicans. The industry's total public
contributions for 1993-1994 were $1,642,229.[26] But that doesn't
account for all contributions.
<p>
In June 1995, Steve Wynn, chairman of Mirage Resorts Inc., hosted
a fund-raiser for Senator Robert Dole (R-Kan.) that took in $477,450.
GOP chairman Haley Barbour isn't embarrassed by gambling money.
He said, &quot;It's not my place to be judgmental about issues
when it comes to allowing people to support us...you don't have
to agree with the Republican party on every issue to support us.&quot;[27]
<p>
Wynn is the genius behind the gaming industry's growth explosion,
according to John L. Smith, who writes in<I> Running Scared</I>
that Wynn has &quot;been accused of shadow-waltzing precariously
close to the wise-guy world.&quot; He dealt with a front man for
the Genovese crime family, and one of his associates was a point
man for Chicago mob lieutenant Johnny Rosselli, according to Smith,
who says Wynn was also associated with convicted junk bond felon
Michael Milken.[28]
<p>
The gambling industry understands the importance of politics.
That's why it hired Frank Fahrenkopf, a Nevada lawyer and former
Republican National Committee chairman. He now heads a $4 million
trade group, the American Gambling Association. This group, financed
by the gambling industry, promotes on Capitol Hill the positive
economic benefits of gambling.[29]
<p>
Gambling money and its agents have often been associated with
political corruption. Federal agents are investigating possible
political corruption in Louisiana. In 1995, senior state legislators
allegedly were caught discussing taking bribes from video-poker
lobbyists. Louisiana State Senator Jay Darnemme states, &quot;Greed,
arrogance, money and power -- it's all there....we went into this
very recklessly. Any states considering gambling ought not use
our formula as a model.&quot;[30]
<p>
The speaker of Missouri's House of Representatives resigned under
a cloud of gambling-related political corruption. In August 1991, FBI agents
in Columbia, South Carolina, wrapped up &quot;Operation Lost Trust,&quot;
which resulted in the bribery-related conviction of numerous legislators
and lobbyists.[31]
<p>
Six Arizona legislators pleaded guilty in 1990 to accepting gambling
bribes and that same year seven Kentucky officials were found
guilty of accepting bribes and making false statements. In 1994,
the West Virginia lottery director was sentenced to federal prison
for rigging a video lottery contract.[32]
<p>
The Clinton Administration has been cozy with the Seminole Tribe
of Florida. Clinton's Solicitor General, Drew Days, filed a last
minute, friend-of-the-court brief in the U.S. Supreme Court siding
with the Seminole Indians' case against the state of Florida.
The Seminoles want casino gambling and say Florida has not been
faithful to the 1988 Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.
<p>
President Clinton's outsider support of the Seminoles waves a
red flag in the face of anti-gambling forces. A check of Florida-based
gaming contributors to the 1996 Clinton/Gore Primary Committee
Inc. found only $6,000, however.[33]
<p>
With annual wagers nationwide now topping half-a-trillion dollars
and gambling profits over $40 billion, there is great opportunity
for corruption.
<p>
<center><h3>GAMBLING AND CRIME</h3></center>
<p>
On October 16, 1995, Joseph Curran, Jr., Maryland's attorney general,
published that state's analysis of the link between gambling and
crime. Curran said, &quot;Casinos would bring a substantial increase
in crime to our state.&quot;[34]
<p>
The Maryland report reflects what virtually every government that
has experienced gambling has found. Jeffrey Bloomberg said, when
casinos came to remote Deadwood, &quot;We have seen individuals
who, prior to their exposure to gambling, had no criminal history,
who were not junkies or alcoholics, many of whom had good jobs,
who became hooked on slot machines and, after losing all their
assets and running all credit resources to their maximum, began
committing some type of crime to support their addiction.&quot;[35]
<p>
Crime on Mississippi's gulf coast increased in every category
after legalization of gambling. Gulfport's chief of police found
overall crime increased more than 100 percent, juvenile crime
shot up 65 percent and alcohol-related accidents increased 101
percent.[36]
<p>
In the first three years after casinos came to Atlantic City,
it went from 50th to first in the nation in per capita crime.
In the first 15 years Atlantic City had casinos, violent crime
skyrocketed almost 500 percent. This was in spite of a 20 percent
population decrease.[37]
<p>
Crime rose 262 percent in Deadwood and police calls in Black Hawk,
Colorado increased from 25 per year before gaming, to as many
as 20,000 today.[38]
<p>
Congressman Wolf testified on September 29, 1995, &quot;Evidence
shows that pathological gamblers engage in forgery, theft, embezzlement,
drug dealing and property crimes to pay off gambling debts. Various
studies indicate that the mean gambling-related debt of people
in compulsive gambling therapy ranged from about $53,000 to $92,000.&quot;[39]
<p>
Durand F. Jacobs, a professor of psychiatry at California's Loma
Linda University and a gambling industry consultant, says that
most people who commit crimes to support their gambling had no
prior criminal records.[40]
<p>
Florida's Department of Law Enforcement studied the probable crime
impact of legalizing gambling and concluded it would cause an
increase in many crime categories. They include: robberies, rape,
theft, drug abuse, aggravated assault, counterfeiting, profit-skimming,
prostitution, credit card scams, loan sharking, and card cheats.[41]
<p>
Given the huge number of dollars involved, gambling legalization
attracts organized crime. Jim Moody, chief of the FBI'S Organized
Crime Section, told <I>60 Minutes</I>, &quot;Gambling itself --
is probably the biggest producer of money for the American La
Cosa Nostra [that] there is.&quot;[42] A former Chicago mobster told
a congressional committee, the introduction of legalized gaming
into Illinois &quot;created a brand new market for us.&quot;[43]
<p>
In 1995, 18 men linked to the Genovese and Gambino crime families
in New York and the Marcello crime family in New Orleans were
convicted of secretly trying to operate a video-poker company
in New Orleans.[44]
<p>
For these reasons Maryland's attorney general Curran warned, &quot;Whatever
dubious financial benefits might flow from casino gaming are outweighed
by the tremendous social costs. Casinos would forever damage the
quality of Maryland life. I urge the task force and the people
of this state to resist the temptation of money that would benefit
too few at the cost of too many.&quot;[45]
<p>
<center><h3>SOCIAL IMPACT</h3></center>
<p>
Americans make more trips to casinos than to major league ballparks,
making gambling the new national pastime. This is evidenced by
the creation of casinos in 23 states and a projection that, by
the year 2000, most Americans will be within a four-hour drive
of a casino.[46]
<p>
This phenomenon is not without social consequences. The American
Psychiatric Association says that gambling addiction parallels
the devastation of alcohol and drug addictions.[47] Although less
than 1 percent of the population have been identified as gambling
addicts, the legalization of gambling could cause that number
to grow to 5 percent, and that includes teenagers.[48]
<p>
Tom Fennelly, a counselor with Gamblers Anonymous, says people
with gambling problems wait to get help until they do something
that bothers their conscience. He told of one woman who became
a prostitute to pay for gambling.[49]
<p>
Robert Goodman reports in the United States Gambling Study that
there are 9.3 million adults and 1.3 million adolescents with
a gambling problem. These are often lower-income residents, and
problem behaviors are worst among the poor and minorities.[50]
<p>
Gambling has caused increased family breakup, suicide, crime,
and massive personal debt. Jason Berg, a 19-year-old from a small
Iowa town, committed suicide after running up gambling debts.
He left a note: &quot;I'm out of control.&quot; Howard Russell,
a 41-year-old salesman, shot himself outside an Illinois casino
after losing more than $50,000.[51] <I>The Kansas City Star</I> reported
the tragic story of a mother who killed herself because she gambled
away the family savings at a casino riverboat.[52]
<p>
The social costs from pathological gambling are high. Peter Reuter,
executive director of the Maryland Task Force on Casino Gambling,
states, there is &quot;no convincing estimate of the average social
costs of an individual becoming a pathological gambler,&quot;
but the &quot;annual costs of $100 million or more in Maryland&quot;
is reasonable.[53]
<p>
Professor Kindt told the House Committee on the Judiciary on September
29, 1995, that the &quot;average socio-economic cost per compulsive
gambler per year has been calculated at $53,000.&quot;[54]
<p>
<center><h3>THE GAMBLER</h3></center>
<p>
Where do gamblers come from? Many gaming supporters count on diverting
funds from other states. They were surprised when a survey by
the Wisconsin Policy Institute of automobile license tags and
the patrons at a Wisconsin-based Indian tribe casino revealed
that nearly 80 percent were local people.[55]
<p>
Paul Dworn, the former editor of a leading gambling trade journal,
argued that most people go to casinos to be entertained: &quot;They
do not go because they have or want to win money.&quot;[56] But gaming
is not like going to Disneyworld or a ball game. It attracts people
who often can't afford the consequences, and it has proven to
be addictive.
<p>
The Wisconsin Policy Institute found that the typical casino gambler
is between 50 and 70 years old and has either retired or has a
blue-collar job. He or she wagers about $101 and loses about half
that amount during each visit.[57]
<p>
A 1995 survey done for the Iowa Department of Human Services found
that the availability of legalized gambling leads to increases
in the prevalence of gambling-related difficulties. Problem gamblers
are increasingly likely to be male, under the age of 30, non-Caucasian
and unmarried. The survey found that 3.5 percent are lifetime
problem gamblers and 1.9 percent are lifetime probable pathological
gamblers.[58]
<p>
Recent studies found lifetime gambling participation rates range
from a low of 74 percent to a high of 92 percent.[59] Iowa's survey
found that respondents spent an average of $40 per month gambling.
Men spend twice as much on gambling as women. People under age
30 spend twice what older gamblers spend. Singles spend more on
gambling ($51 per month) than marrieds ($31 per month).[60]
<p>
The economic strain on gamblers is often crippling. Kansas City's
Family Policy Council found that lower-income households spend
five to 10 times as much per capita on lottery tickets as do middle-income
homes. Since casinos came to Missouri, there has been a dramatic
increase in the number of pawn shops. Today, Kansas City has 38
shops, compared to four in 1979. Twelve shops opened within 18
months of the establishment of riverboat gambling.[61]
<p>
A Kansas City pawn shop owner said, &quot;You see people come
in here who can't afford to buy groceries, but they pawn their
VCR and go to the boat, where they lose $500.&quot; St. Louis'
Gamblers Anonymous reports that gamblers get money from their
life insurance and more than a third actually cancel their policies.
Nearly $1.3 billion of insurance fraud is committed each year
by pathological gamblers.[62]
<p>
The legalization of gambling and the number of pathological gamblers
appear to be linked, and some researchers believe gambling is
the fastest-growing addiction among teenagers. Henry Lesieur, Chair of 
the Criminal Justice Department at Illinois State University, headed a 1991 
panel that studied gambling among college students. The panel surveyed six 
schools in five states and concluded that almost one-quarter of students 
gamble at least once a week.[63]
<p>
Arnie Wexler, executive director of the Council on Compulsive
Gambling of New Jersey, estimates that the number of problem gamblers
will grow as the industry expands. He graphically portrays gambling's
temptation for some. &quot;If you put a guy who wouldn't cheat
on his wife in a room with a gorgeous nude woman, some guys would
fall by the wayside.&quot;[64] While this scenario would not excuse
a man from cheating, Wexler argues that, in the same way, state
approved gambling encourages many people to bet and a certain
percentage will become pathological.
<p>
<center><h3>GAMBLING REGULATION</h3></center>
<p>
Today, there are six major sectors of legal gambling: lotteries,
casino-style gambling, pari-mutuel racing, non-profits (including
bingo and Las Vegas nights), Indian high-stakes bingo and mini-casinos.
Regulating this rapidly expanding industry is expensive and complicated.
<p>
The state of Florida estimated it would cost nearly $50 million
to regulate 34 casinos, and that figure isn't unrealistic.[65] After
all, the 1991 annual budget for New Jersey's Casino Control Commission
was nearly $26 million, and that state's casinos are concentrated
in one city, not spread across a large state.[66]
<p>
But gaming regulation costs don't stop there. The New Jersey Division
of Gaming Enforcement spends another $36 million annually, a portion
of which provides police personnel for patrol and investigative
functions.[67]
<p>
The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 created a federal commission
to set gaming rules and oversee regulation of Indian bingo games.
The federal regulation effort is scanty, however. There are less
than 30 staff persons to regulate hundreds of Indian casinos across
the nation.[68]
<p>
Bob Renneisen, president and CEO, Claridge's Casino, Atlantic
City said, &quot;Our goal is not to get more out of a customer
in three hours but to get him to stay for four hours.&quot;[69] He
figures that the gambler will lose more with time since all casino
games give the house a mathematical edge.
<p>
The industry has studied gambling psychology. The casinos don't
want the gambler to realize he is losing. Jack Binion, owner of
Horseshoe Casino, Las Vegas, said, &quot;What is gambling? It's
really just a hype on emotion.&quot; Bill Zneder, operations chief,
Aladdin Casino, Las Vegas, said, &quot;If you give a guy a $100
bill he looks at it like a round of golf, a golf cart, two beers
and a hot dog. But if you give him chips, it's just betting units
and it loses its value.&quot;[70]
<p>
<center><h3>ADVERTISING GAMBLING</h3></center>
<p>
As governments have become more dependent on gambling, their regulation
efforts have shifted somewhat to promotion. According to gambling
expert Robert Goodman, legislators are tending to legalize-higher-revenue
producing games just as the market is becoming saturated.[71] This
is why public subsidies have been used to help competing private
gambling operations survive.
<p>
Since 1934, the federal government has had a long-standing policy
of prohibiting gambling-related advertising. Current federal criminal
law generally prohibits anyone from broadcasting &quot;[a]ny advertisement
of or information concerning any lottery, gift enterprise, or
similar scheme, [or] offering prizes dependent in whole or in
part upon lot or chance.&quot;[72]
<p>
The law does permit not-for-profit organizations to advertise
if the activity is &quot;clearly occasional and ancillary to the
primary business of that organization.&quot; But that might soon
change.
<p>
Pro-gambling forces in the Senate tried to amend the Telecommunications
Competition and Deregulation Act of 1995 to &quot;allow commercial
gambling enterprises to advertise on radio and television, thereby
reversing a long-standing federal policy against commercial gambling
advertising.&quot;[73]
<p>
State governments already spend more than $300 million a year
in lottery advertisements.[74] Taxpayer funded pro-gambling ads mixed
with industry-paid ads could fill the airways with messages that
promote gambling, thus drawing in more gullible victims.
<p>
<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>
<p>
Despite its popularity, legalized gambling is taking the country
in the wrong direction. Gambling is not an economic savior but
a disease that claims millions of victims.
<p>
President Clinton supports Congressman Wolf's proposal. In a letter
to Senator Simon, Clinton said, &quot;Too often, public officials
view gambling as a quick and easy way to raise revenues, without
focusing on gambling's hidden social, economic and political costs.&quot;
<p>
A national gambling commission could examine and publicize the
devastating consequences of legalized gambling. After the commission,
public policymakers should consider legislation to re-criminalize
or severely limit all forms of gambling.

<h2>FCC PONDERS BIGGER FEDERAL<br>
ROLE IN CHILDREN'S<br>
TELEVISION</h2>

<p>
The Federal Communications Commission is considering a set of
rules that would greatly increase federal oversight of children's
television programming.
<p>
In order to further implement the Children's Television Act of
1990, the FCC is considering:
<p><ul>
<li>Issuing a &quot;more particularized&quot; definition of &quot;educational
and informational&quot; content.
<p><li>Requiring commercial broadcasters to carry a quota of 
&quot;educational&quot; programming, or pay another (probably a Public 
Broadcasting Service affiliate) to carry an equivalent amount of such 
programming.
<p><li>Adopting licensing renewal &quot;processing guidelines&quot;
which would allow the FCC to refuse license renewal to broadcasters
if program quotas are not met.
<p><li>Restricting credit for &quot;educational&quot; fare to designated
&quot;core&quot; programming (which would eliminate consideration
of specials and public service spots that might otherwise be deemed
&quot;educational&quot;).
<p><li>Requiring on-air designations of programs as &quot;educational.&quot;
<p><li>Defining as &quot;educational&quot; those programs for which
educational content is a &quot;significant purpose&quot; of the
show.
<p><li>Excluding for credit any programs that air before 7 a.m. and
after 10 p.m.
<p><li>Monitoring the total amount of educational and informational
programming over a specific time period.
</ul><p>
Given that the worth of specifically &quot;educational&quot; programming
for children is debatable, that public television already provides
many hours of such programming, and that the networks have steadily
increased their &quot;educational&quot; fare in recent years,
it does not appear that an expansion of federal power over television
is warranted.
<p>
More importantly, there are serious First Amendment problems with
any attempt by government to mandate specific programming content.
<p>
<center><h3>BACKGROUND</h3></center>
<p>
In 1989, a U.S. Senate report found that there was &quot;disturbingly
little&quot; programming &quot;that serves the special needs of
children&quot; and that time periods in which children were most
likely to be watching were filled with &quot;reruns of adult or
family comedy, variety, or dramatic programs.&quot;[1] Several cartoon
shows, whose main characters were heavily marketed as toys (such
as G.I. Joe) were criticized by public interest groups as being
little more than show-length toy commercials. Pressure groups
such as Action for Children's Television lobbied hard for some
federal oversight. They found a sympathetic ear in Sen. Daniel
Inouye (D-Hawaii), who sponsored the Senate version of the Children's
Television Act (CTA).
<p>
In 1990, Congress passed the CTA &quot;to increase the amount
of educational and informational broadcast television programming
available to children and to protect children from over-commercialization
of programming.&quot;[2] It was signed into law by President George
Bush.
<p>
The Act limits advertising spots to 10.5 minutes per hour during
weekends and 12 minutes per hour during weekdays.[3] It also prohibits
the advertising of program-based products on the same shows. For
instance, the <I>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers</I> show cannot
include ads for Power Ranger dolls. The Act also directs the FCC
to review, at license renewal time, whether broadcasters have
served the &quot;educational and informational needs of children.&quot;
<p>
In 1991, the FCC issued rules and policies implementing the Children's
Television Act. Television station licensees were required to
respond to the &quot;educational and informational needs of children
16 years of age and under.&quot; No program quotas were established,
and the FCC said it would take into consideration any programming
that served children's &quot;positive development in any way,
including serving their cognitive/intellectual or social/emotional
needs.&quot;[4]
<p>
Irked by some broadcasters' insistence that shows like <I>The
Flintstones, Leave it to Beaver,</I> and <I>The Jetsons</I> meet
the definition of &quot;educational and informational,&quot; the
FCC concluded in a 1993 report that, &quot;We do not believe that
the level of performance is, in the long term, consistent with
the objectives underlying the CTA.&quot;[5]
<p>
Pressure from a coalition of interest groups including the Center
for Media Education, the National Education Association, the National
PTA and others resulted in a renewed effort by the FCC to further
refine the implementation rules for CTA. The coalition proposes
that broadcast licensees be required to provide at least one hour
a day of &quot;educational&quot; children's programming, to be
determined with tougher FCC standards.
<p>
In June 1995, a hearing was held before the full Commission, attended
by broadcasters, interest groups and media. The FCC also asked
for public comment to be submitted in writing, with final comments
and replies being closed on November 20, 1995. More than 600 entries
were filed, from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, private
citizens, TV networks, program providers such as Walt Disney Company,
and many religious and interest groups such as the United Church
of Christ, U.S. Catholic Conference, and the Children's Defense
Fund.[6] Most commentators backed some sort of tightening of the
rules, but the networks and several others argued hard against
program quotas, citing the First Amendment.
<p>
In October 1995, Professor Dale Kunkel of the University of California,
Santa Barbara, released a survey that says some TV stations are
meeting the &quot;kidvid&quot; requirement by airing programs
such as <I>Biker Mice from Mars, America's Funniest Home Videos</I>,
and <I>Yogi Bear</I>.&quot;[7]
<p>
In an Oct. 18, 1995 speech before the National Press Club, FCC
Chairman Reed Hundt cited the Kunkel study, and took particular
aim at NBC's claim that <I>NBA Inside Stuff</I> was educational. 
NBC lawyer Rick Cotton responded that the show
&quot;uses sports to attract teenagers to a program, and then
we provide educational and informational material. This highlights
the problem of government trying to set itself up as the arbiter
of what is educational.&quot;[8]
<p>
<center><h3>THE CASE FOR STATE INTERVENTION ON BEHALF OF CHILDREN</h3></center>
<p>
As noted in the FCC brief filed by the United States Catholic
Conference, &quot;The Supreme Court has not required scientific
exactitude when legislative and administrative bodies take actions
helpful to children and their parents. The Court has deferred
to the judgments of legislators and administrators when harm to
children is at issue.&quot;
<p>
The USCC cites a number of cases in which the court has upheld
state action &quot;aimed at protecting the physical and emotional
well-being of youth.&quot;[9]
<p>
True enough. If public officials depended only on scientific research,
then there would be a pressing need for studies to show that placing
a small child in heavy traffic is dangerous. Some truths are self-evident,
and the general concept of protecting children has been an accepted
societal value in the United States since before its founding.
The only question is how to balance the legitimate public interest
in protecting children with other rights, such as the freedom
of speech, and parental authority. Over the years, the courts
have approved government abridgments of the freedom of speech
when it was determined that children would be unduly harmed without
benefit of such law. Most recently, a federal appeals court in
Washington, D.C. upheld the FCC's right to prohibit indecent programming
between the hours of 6 a.m. and 10 p.m., citing the government's
&quot;compelling interest&quot; in protecting children.[10]
<p>
But shielding children from pornography, excessive violence and
coarse language is different from legislating prescriptive programming.
It is one thing to put a health warning label on a pack of cigarettes,
for instance, and another to require all citizens to take vitamins.
Similarly, it is one thing to shield children from smut and another
to require specific broadcasting content determined by government.
<p>
In tackling this thorny issue, the FCC has been lobbied to tighten
the requirements on broadcasters to air &quot;educational&quot;
programs. Here is a closer look at what is proposed.
<p>
<center><h3>DEFINING A MORE &quot;PARTICULARIZED&quot; EDUCATIONAL
AND INFORMATIONAL CONTENT</h3></center>
<p>
Currently, the FCC has broad discretion in defining what is good
TV fare for children. Stations can cite anything aired as part
of their repertoire of child-friendly programming. In 1990, Sen. Daniel 
Inouye provided this definition to convey the intent of Congress:
<p>
&quot;Educational and informational needs encompass not only intellectual
development, but also the child's emotional and social development.
Pro-social programming which assists children to discover more
about themselves, their families, and the world would qualify.&quot;[11]
<p>
The danger in adopting a more refined definition is that it may
lead to a one-size-fits-all, government-designated type of children's
programming. Given the ability of ideologues of various stripes
to commandeer government power to their advantage, expanding the
FCC's power in this way may lead to politically correct programming.
Religious programs might be considered either unimportant or even
detrimental, depending on who is doing the assessment and whose
agenda is being served. As government power grows, religion is
pushed out of the public square by those who expansively interpret
the &quot;wall of separation&quot; between church and state. Also,
concern for &quot;diversity&quot; of lifestyle might weigh more
heavily with the FCC than imagination and dramatic content.
<p>
For example, the Public Broadcasting Service outlet in Akron,
Ohio, aired the one-hour homosexual propaganda show <I>What If
I'm Gay?</I> between <I>Kidsongs TV</I> and <I>Sesame Street</I>,
from 10 a.m. to 11 a.m. one Thursday in July 1994.[12] Someone thought
this was suitable educational fare for a preschool audience.
<p>
Appointing an academic panel to come up with suitable definitions,
which some FCC observers have proposed, is also fraught with peril,
since academia has proved to be at least as susceptible as government
bureaucrats to the virus of political correctness. And the networks are not 
immune to the same cultural forces. Turner Broadcasting's <I>Captain Planet</I> 
is often cited as an example of responsible privately-generated programming 
for children, but the show also has been severely criticized by some observers 
for its allegedly radical environmentalist themes.
<p>
<center><h3>QUOTAS FOR EDUCATIONAL TELEVISION</h3></center>
<p>
Any government regulation that forces privately owned broadcasters
to air specified content risks violating the First Amendment guarantee
against forced speech of any kind.
<p>
Courts consistently have allowed only the narrowest exceptions
to this rule. In 1984, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that any government
content rules must be &quot;narrowly tailored to further a substantial
government interest.&quot;[13]
<p>
The U.S. Supreme Court in 1973 upheld the FCC's refusal to force
broadcasters to carry editorial advertisements, saying that such
a move runs &quot;the risk of an enlargement of Government control
over the content of broadcast discussion of public issues.&quot;[14]
In 1974, the Supreme Court upheld the right of a newspaper not
to have to publish government-dictated copy.[15] And in 1986, the
Supreme Court reiterated that &quot;what to say and what to leave
unsaid&quot;[16] were both protected by the First Amendment's prohibition
against &quot;abridging the freedom of speech.&quot;
<p>
In Turner Broadcasting Systems v. FCC (1994), which concerned
whether cable systems could be compelled to carry broadcast signals,
the U.S. Supreme Court said of the FCC that &quot;oversight responsibilities
do not grant it power to ordain any particular type of programming
that must be offered by broadcast stations.&quot;[17]
<p>
The FCC itself has never adopted specific prescriptions of programming,
and has formally rejected such proposals on two occasions.
<p>
Apart from the constitutional question, the FCC would have to
justify such a major government intrusion by proving that 1) there
is an indisputable need for such programming; 2) such programming
does not exist already or 3) children do not have reasonable access
to such programming if it does exist.
<p>
There is very little independent data to indicate that children
are better off watching television -- even &quot;educational&quot;
TV -- than playing, reading or engaging in other activities. In
fact, the drumbeat for &quot;educational&quot; television is part
of a larger lobbying effort in behalf of the concept of early
childhood education. The current, number-one education goal of
the Clinton Administration is that every child &quot;come to school
ready to learn.&quot;
<p>
Declining literacy rates and school test scores have persuaded
some educators to target preschoolers for education, despite the
fact that the presumed benefits of early introduction to formal
learning lack a solid base of research. Just as the supporters
of Head Start have justified its efficacy repeatedly over the
years by reference to a single, nonrepresentative study of 52
preschoolers in a private day-care setting,[18] the educational TV
lobby has based its case for early formal learning on studies
that raise questions of bias.
<p>
In its FCC brief, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting cites
a &quot;1995 report released by Children's Television Workshop&quot;
revealing that &quot;viewing educational television, including
Sesame Street, helps preschoolers in three ways: they are better
prepared to enter school; they perform better on verbal and math
tests as late as age 7; and they spend more time reading.&quot;
Children's Television Workshop produces <I>Sesame Street</I> and
other public TV children's programs. Other data cited by CPB (from
a study commissioned by CPB) indicates that &quot;88 percent of
all preschoolers and 80 percent of all kindergartners watch at
least one of four public broadcasting programs each week -- <I>Sesame
Street, Reading Rainbow, Mister Rogers' Neighborhood</I> and <I>Barney
and Friends</I>.&quot;[19]
<p>
If this is so, then the question must be asked: If PBS educational
television has made such a difference, why have test scores continued
to decline? According to <I>Ready to Learn</I>, a 1991 report
by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, increasing
numbers of pupils are deficient in language skills. Why do children
seem less prepared? Could it be that children have become so addicted
to television that they have difficulty concentrating on real
school work? Could it be that a steady diet of television reduces
a child's attention span more than it educates?
<p>
PBS defenders often cite studies by the Educational Testing Service,
sponsored by Children's Television Workshop, that report significant
gains among young viewers in a number of basic skills such as
counting and naming letters and numbers. A later Russell Sage
Foundation review of the data concluded that the gains were more
modest and that they could be attributed to other factors inherent
in the research method. Also, the Sage study found that the show
increased the intellectual gap between middle-class and poor children,
the opposite of ETA's findings.[20]
<p>
Something of a national sacred cow, <I>Sesame Street</I> is loved
by children and adults alike. Its production values have always
been high, and the content is witty and funny. Big Bird, Bert
and Ernie and other characters have become national icons.
<p>
Touted since its inception as an educational device, the show
is high-quality enter-tainment that parents often will watch with
their children. However, the &quot;educational&quot; effects,
some critics argue, may have been exaggerated to garner public
funding and to alleviate the guilt of parents who let <I>Sesame
Street</I> baby-sit their toddlers for hours on end.
<p>
One <I>Sesame Street</I> critic, Kay S. Hymowitz, even questions
the show's central premise -- that it is good for children. Writing
in the public policy periodical <I>City Journal</I>, Hymowitz
notes that for all its touted &quot;diversity,&quot; <I>Sesame
Street</I> &quot;couldn't be more monocultural and conformist
in its unwavering endorsement of American anti-intellectualism
and [the] cult of the cool.&quot;[21] Hymowitz explains that the skits
trivialize great literature and great events by making them conform
to whatever is current in popular culture, particularly television
shows. She also detects a drumbeat that kids must be &quot;cool&quot;
about everything. Encouraging children to adopt a skeptical approach
to life teaches the &quot;folly&quot; of being passionate about
anything. This can have the side effect of encouraging children
to detach from the beliefs of their parents.
<p>
Hymowitz also notes that <I>Sesame Street</I> &quot;focuses on
mere technical skills, the tools of mental cultivation, rather
than mental cultivation itself; the building blocks of thought
rather than thought....Worse, the show's anti-intellectualism
and its glorification of television culture over print send the
implicit message that the skills of literacy have no meaningful
purpose.&quot;
<p>
Aware that she may come off as something of an Oscar the Grouch,
Hymowitz acknowledges the show's appeal (&quot;who can resist
the clever witticisms of sophisticated television?&quot;) but
stresses that her main concern is the impression that <I>Sesame
Street</I> is an unalloyed educational bonanza.
<p>
No matter how educational <I>Sesame Street</I> appears to be,
if its net effect has been to make school seem dull by comparison,
and to help shorten youngsters' attention spans, then it may not
be such a good idea to promote television viewing of any type
for children. The most powerful argument, outside CTW's own studies,
is that children &quot;are going to watch TV anyway,&quot; which
has some resonance, given the overwhelming evidence that children
do spend many hours in front of the tube.
<p>
Finally, considering the enormous amount of &quot;educational&quot;
programming provided by public television[22] (PBS regularly airs
such popular shows as <I>Sesame Street, Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood,
Barney and Friends, Where in the World Is Carmen San Diego?, Ghostwriter,
Puzzleplace, Shining Time Station</I> and <I>Reading Rainbow)</I>
and the fact that most American children are already tuning into
these shows in large numbers, and the fact that the networks have
increased their &quot;educational&quot; output significantly in
recent years,[23] proponents would be hard pressed to prove that children
have so little access to &quot;educational&quot; television that
an unprecedented government intrusion into content is warranted.
<p>
CTA sponsor Sen. Daniel Inouye noted during debate over passage
of the bill in 1990 that the total programming mix should be &quot;left
to the discretion of the broadcaster, taking into account what
other stations, including non-commercial ones, are doing in this
important area.&quot;[24]
<p>
<center><h3>PROGRAM SPONSORSHIP OPTION</h3></center>
<p>
Public television has nearly monopolized weekly children's programming.
The FCC is considering allowing commercial stations to subsidize
such programming on other channels (such as PBS) as a way to satisfy
their overall duty to serve children's needs. This proposal has
support primarily from the public broadcasting community. In its
FCC brief, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting notes that:
&quot;With CPB at the helm, public television has embraced the
education of America's youth as its core mission for over 25 years.&quot;[25]
CPB promotes the concept of the &quot;program sponsorship&quot;
option in which broadcast licensees would meet a prescribed quota
of children's programming by airing it or by providing &quot;financial
or in-kind support&quot; to &quot;host&quot; stations in the same
market.
<p>
CPB notes that this would result in &quot;shifting programming
dollars to the broadcasters with the greatest expertise in and
commitment to children's educational programming -- the noncommercial
educational broadcasters.&quot;[26]
<p>
CPB also suggests that stations should not be allowed to satisfy
all of the requirement this way, and should provide at least some
educational broadcasts of their own, citing Sen. Inouye's wish
that the FCC &quot;would, of course, expect that each station
will itself broadcast some programming specifically designed for
children to serve their educational and informational needs.&quot;[27]
<p>
Several critics have charged that the formula amounts to a guaranteed
subsidy to Children's Television Workshop, among others. Dr. Laurence
Jarvik of the Center for the Study of Popular Culture calls the
idea &quot;a shakedown by PBS, pure and simple. You might as well
have Big Bird put a gun to their head.&quot;[28]
<p>
Peggy Charren, founder of Action for Children's Television, also
opposes the sponsorship option: &quot;PBS serves the needs of
children now. Allowing stations to simply pay another station
to do programming does not fulfill stations' obligations to serve
the needs of children.&quot;[29]
<p>
Jeff Chester, executive director of the Center for Media Education,
which lobbies for the new FCC requirements, nonetheless also opposes
the sponsorship option: &quot;The intent of the law was for every
station to air a significant amount of programming for children.&quot;[30]
<p>
Rep. Ed Markey (D-Mass.), who, as chairman of the House telecommunications
subcommittee played an important role in passing the CTA, said
in an interview that &quot;the intent of the Act was not to have
stations pay PBS to do their programming for them.&quot;[31]
<p>
<center><h3>ADOPTING LICENSING RENEWAL &quot;PROCESSING GUIDELINES&quot;
</h3></center>
<p>
Processing guidelines would designate how much &quot;educational
or informational&quot; material had to be included for a licensee
to qualify under any new definitions. They would be the &quot;teeth&quot;
for the FCC to withhold license renewal based on compliance. As
such, they would constitute the equivalent of program quotas,
which would be an infringement of broadcasters' First Amendment

<center><h3>RESTRICTING CREDIT FOR &quot;EDUCATIONAL&quot; FARE
TO &quot;CORE,&quot; STANDARD-LENGTH PROGRAMMING ONLY</h3></center>
<p>
In an attempt to ensure regularity of wholesome content, proponents
suggest that broadcast licensees not be able to include specials
and short subjects when they make their case to the FCC that they
have served the &quot;educational and informational&quot; needs
of children. They recommend that only regularly scheduled, 
&quot;standard-length&quot; programs (at least a half-hour in length) be 
counted.
<p>
While the intent seems reasonable, the formula would discourage
imaginative public service announcements generated by the ad industry
and by interest groups. It may also discourage sponsorship of
TV specials.
<p>
The Walt Disney Company, which produces all manner of children's
programming, argued in its FCC brief for the value of non-regular
programming:
<p>
&quot;Certain lessons, for example, can be conveyed best in a
short segment, but might become overbearing or pedantic if relegated
to a 15- or 30-minute format. Anyone who can recall the impact
of the anti-drug commercial depicting a man breaking an egg into
a frying pan and watching it sizzle with the voice-over, 'This
is your brain. This is your brain on drugs. Any questions?,' knows
the unique educational value that such programming can have.&quot;[32]
<p>
<I>Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue</I>, described by NBC as &quot;a
history-making animated anti-substance abuse television special
for children,&quot; was broadcast on all major TV networks and
&quot;hundreds of independent stations and cable outlets throughout
the U.S.&quot;[33] ABC airs the Schoolhouse Rock series during its Saturday 
morning lineup. The animated, three-minute segments are set to music and
have featured such topics as multiplication tables (<I>Zero Is
My Hero</I>), grammar (<I>Conjunction Junction</I>), history (<I>Preamble
to the Constitution</I>), and science (<I>Electricity</I>).[34]
<p>
The Senate Report on the Children's Television Act of 1990 emphasizes
an &quot;overall&quot; assessment of programming to children,
and specifies that the requirement &quot;does not exclude any
programming that does in fact serve the informational and educational
needs of children.&quot;[35]
<p>
An alternative to a ban on counting other than &quot;core&quot;
programs might be for the FCC merely to state that it encourages
more regularly scheduled programming for children as part of a
good-faith effort by broadcasters. Licensees could then score
points by offering more &quot;core&quot; shows, but be able to
present significant short-subject spots as additional proof of
commitment to children's needs. Again, this is contingent upon
acceptance of an increase in the FCC's power over children's programming.
<p>
<center><h3>REQUIRING ON-AIR DESIGNATIONS OF PROGRAMS AS 
&quot;EDUCATIONAL&quot;</h3></center>
<p>
Children are drawn to particular television shows for their entertainment
value. Parents may be far more interested in a show's educational
content. An on-air designation might seem to be a valuable tool
for parents, but it risks the same problems as posed by specific
content regulation. Educational designations could be granted
or withheld arbitrarily or for ideological reasons. The designations
could also have the unintended effect of &quot;warning&quot; children
that &quot;somebody thinks this is good for you, so prepare to
be bored.&quot; Good, entertaining educational fare could wind
up being stigmatized.
<p>
The idea has other problems. As Disney points out, &quot;requiring
an on-air identification attached to a particular program will
serve no such benefit unless the parent is not only watching television
but also watching the particular channel at the moment the identification
is aired.&quot;[36]
<p>
A system to determine such designations would artificially divide
the world of programming into the &quot;educational&quot; and
the &quot;uneducational.&quot; Since the definition of &quot;educational&quot;
is so subjective, and programming does not lend itself to such
draconian division, the system would be unworkable. It is a simple
task to affix warning labels because of specific content, such
as sex, violence or vulgar language, which can be quantified.
But it is another to determine an entire program's subjective
worth as an educational device.
<p>
A reasonable alternative might be to encourage the provision of
published guides on TV content and program guides for parents.
But again, this should not be required.
<p>
<center><h3>DEFINING AS &quot;EDUCATIONAL&quot; THOSE PROGRAMS
FOR WHICH EDUCATIONAL CONTENT IS A &quot;SIGNIFICANT&quot;
PART OF THE SHOW</h3></center>
<p>
When the FCC first proposed new rules for children's TV, the agency
suggested that education must be the &quot;primary&quot; purpose
of educational programs. Now, it has shifted to the stance that
education be a &quot;significant&quot; purpose. This was a reasonable
accommodation, given the power of entertainment to attract viewers.
<p>
<I>Bill Nye the Science Guy</I> is a Disney-produced weekly program
that teaches children about scientific wonders using graphics,
special effects, music video-type sound and comedy.
<p>
&quot;Someone recently asked me to break down into percentages
the entertainment and educational components of our show,&quot;
Nye told an interviewer. &quot;Quite honestly, I couldn't do it.
But I am 100 percent certain that the program is more than 50
percent entertainment -- or kids wouldn't watch.&quot;[37]
<p>
The jury is out as to what exactly is educational fare. Jarvik
notes that even shows such as the Fox cartoon comedy <I>The Simpsons</I>
should not be dismissed as lacking educational content. &quot;While
I don't approve of a foul-mouthed brat, at the least, children
see a family with a father and mother. I suspect that some of
those who disapprove of <I>The Simpsons</I> dislike the idea of
kids seeing an intact, traditional family, and would rather replace
it with something like a cartoon television version of <I>Heather
Has Two Mommies</I>.&quot;[38]
<p>
Moreover, much of the television that children watch is not geared
specifically for them but may, in fact, be educational. What do
children derive from seeing re-runs of <I>The Waltons</I>, for
instance? The hour-long show, in syndication, features a wholesome
Virginia family working out its problems during the Depression.
While not being specifically &quot;educational,&quot; the show
conceivably conveys more valuable information about life to children
than a designated &quot;educational&quot; program.
<p>
<center><h3>EXCLUDING FOR CREDIT ANY PROGRAMS THAT AIR BEFORE 7 A.M. AND
AFTER 10 P.M.</h3></center>
<p>
Proponents of this provision charge that TV stations are airing
some &quot;educational&quot; programs when no one is watching,
in the early hours of the morning, for instance. They want a 7
a.m. standard so that more children would be exposed to educational
content.
<p>
In many markets, public television provides <I>Sesame Street</I>
and other children's shows beginning at 6 a.m. and running throughout
the morning. TV ratings data, as noted in a July 1995 opinion
of the federal D.C. Court of Appeals, show that many children
are viewing television between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m., and even later
into the evening.[39] The Nielsen Company has found that an estimated
1.5 million children aged two to 11, or five percent of all children,
watch TV Monday through Friday at 6 a.m and that an estimated
2.4 million children aged two to 11 (6.3 percent) tune in by 6:30
a.m.[40] Rule proponents contend that this is too small a proportion
of child viewers to make enough difference.
<p>
The networks contend that most educational programming takes place
after 7 a.m. anyway. A study by the National Association of Broadcasters
says that during fall 1994, some 81.4 percent of programs identified
by licensees as &quot;educational and informational&quot; were
broadcast after 7 a.m, with 15.8 percent being aired before 7
a.m.[41] NBC, in its FCC brief, suggests that the FCC give credit
with no time limit, but &quot;if the Commission nonetheless feels
compelled to take some action to allay its concerns in this regard,
we believe it should simply state that licensees must broadcast
some qualifying standard-length programming after 7 a.m. and that
licensees meeting this standard will receive full credit for all
their qualifying programming broadcast during the hours of 6 a.m.
to 11 p.m.&quot;
<p>
Limiting credit to educational fare after 7 a.m. might eliminate
some licensees' obvious dodges, such as scheduling a teen educational
program at 6 a.m. on Sunday morning, when most teens are still
asleep. But it might have an unintended effect of discouraging
<I>any</I> educational programming between 6 a.m .and 7 a.m.,
when up to two million children are watching. Perhaps the FCC
should consider counting as educational fare during those hours
only those programs that appeal to the prime audience during that
time -- small children.
<p>
<center><h3>MONITORING THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMMING OVER
A SPECIFIC TIME PERIOD</h3></center>
<p>
One of the more arguably valuable functions of government is data
collecting, since this can shed light on a problem. It can also
create issues, and data can be (and frequently is) manipulated
for partisan ends. But at least the government must give everybody
access to the data.
<p>
Outside of the census, there is no constitutional provision for
federal agencies to collect data. The best argument that can be
made is that data collection helps bureaucrats and lawmakers do
their job better, so it adds to the &quot;general welfare.&quot;
<p>
Should the FCC decide to do anything with regard to children's
television, the agency is on the safest grounds in collecting
data on programming. But the enterprise is open to abuse, such
as widely-varying definitions of what constitutes &quot;educational
and informative&quot; programming for children. This brings us
back to the central problem: Is the federal government legally
and practically suited to the task of fine-tuning children's television?
The honest answer is no.
<p>
<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>
<p>
More federal control of children's television programming is not
in the best interests of children and their parents and would
constitute an unwarranted violation of the First Amendment rights
of broadcasters. Children learn in many ways, and government-dictated
designation of some material as &quot;educational&quot; may lead
to politically-correct programming and more government control
of the dissemination of information. The FCC should reject the
proposed rules.

explained above, applies to all income. The 12.4  percent Social Security tax,
however, applies only  to the first $61,600 of income (the reason being that
Social Security is somewhat akin to  an insurance premium; taxing additional
income would have the effect of boosting the  retirement benefits of those who
had higher  incomes during their working years).

<P><TT><B><A NAME="6">6</A></B></TT>	This is not to suggest that 
politicians should be given power to invest the funds.  Such a policy inevitably
would result in political manipulation, as surplus funds would be  steered to
politically wellconnected industries  and used to bail out businesses in the
states and districts of senior lawmakers.  A governmentcontrolled retirement
system, by definition, must be operated on a  payasyougo basis.
</P>
<P><TT><B><A NAME="7">7</A></B></TT> The chart shows a decline in tax 
collections in the early 1980s, but this occurred  as a result of the 19811982
recession (which started, incidentally, before Reagan's  first fiscal year
began). Moreover, this decline  in revenue also took place before there was a
tax cut. The Reagan economic package was  approved in the summer of 1981, but
the tax cut  was phased in over several years and not fully implemented until
1985. The tax burden  actually rose in Reagan's first year in office, as the
minor tax cut in 1981 was overwhelmed  by previously legislated payroll tax
increases and inflationinduced bracket creep  (indexing to protect taxpayers
from inflation did not  go into effect until 1985). The 1982 portion of the tax
cut was more significant, but it  was roughly canceled out by bracket creep and
payroll tax changes.

income. For families with two children, the two credits are phased out fully  at
$150,000 in income. For single filers, the credit begins to phase out at $75,000
in  income.

<p> 
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Last winter's budget battle between Congress and the President was seen by most observers as a victory for the President and a defeat for fiscal conservatives in Congress who were attempting to make major reductions and reforms in government spending programs. But when the smoke cleared and the fiscal year (FY) 1996 budget process finally came to a close, it was apparent that while a rhetorical battle was lost, the budget war was won by the fiscal conservatives. And the victory was unprecedented in scope.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

How complete was the victory?  The 104th Congress:<ul>

<p><li>Reduced year-over-year discretionary spending for the first time since 1969.

<p><li>Reduced the number of bureaucrats at 29 of the 39 major government offices between 1994 and 1996.<sup>1</sup>

<p><li>Eliminated over 270 programs, agencies, offices, and projects.

<p><li>Helped reduce the deficit to the lowest level in 14 years. Only President Reagan's FY 1982 budget deficit was lower.

<p><li>Enacted into law more privatizations in just one year than occurred during the entire eight years of the Reagan Administration.

<p><li>Forced a national debate on structural welfare reform and encouraged states to continue to overhaul their welfare systems. Since taking office, Wisconsin's Governor Tommy Thompson has effectively reformed his state's welfare program and reduced caseloads by 40 percent-- reducing the demand for federal as well as state dollars. The 104th Congress included as part of welfare reform legislation much of the Wisconsin plan. Unfortunately, President Clinton chose to veto the bill.

<p><li>Deregulated the agriculture and telecommunications industries. Congress passed a 1996 farm bill that begins to bring an end to costly Depression-era agriculture programs by getting government out of the business of telling farmers what to grow. This was the most sweeping reform in 60 years. Farmers increasingly will be able to grow to meet the demands of the market rather than the federal government. In addition, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 eliminates decades worth of outdated rules and restrictions on the telephone, cable, and broadcast industries. It will expand job and export opportunities within the industry, lower the cost of basic communications services, and free consumers to choose between competing providers of service.</ul><p>



<b>WHAT BUDGET DEFEAT?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Although many in Congress have come to believe that they lost the budget war, the facts indicate otherwise. As the final FY 1996 budget reveals, this Congress accomplished an unprecedented reduction and elimination of unneeded federal programs, federal bureaucrats, and federal spending. To be sure, Congress did not close any of the four Cabinet departments -- Commerce, Education, Energy, Housing and Urban Development -- it targeted. Nor did it see its ambitious national reforms in welfare, Medicaid, and Medicare signed into law. But the hundreds of reforms it did accomplish were comprehensive and far-reaching. Indeed, many of its accomplishments were far bolder than even the intentions of the early Reagan Administration, which until now have served as the benchmark for ambitious fiscal restraint.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	In the discretionary budget accounts alone, FY 1996 discretionary spending will experience its first decline since 1969 as a result of program terminations and major cuts. More than 270 separate programs, offices, agencies, projects, and divisions were eliminated completely. These include the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation, the Office of Travel and Tourism, the Institute of American Indian and Alaska Native Culture and Arts, the Office of Technology Assessment, the Interstate Commerce Commission, the Bureau of Mines, the Administrative Conference of the United States, and hundreds of other programs throughout the government.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	And whereas Congress fell short in its efforts to terminate such targeted programs as the Appalachian Regional Commission, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the Legal Services Corporation, it cut their budgets substantially and forced them to curtail activities. Indeed, even by early Reagan-era standards, the reforms are unprecedented. Examples:<ul>

<p><li>The first Reagan budget proposed to cut the National Endowment for the Arts by 27 percent, but achieved a 17 percent reduction. This Congress cut the Endowment by 38 percent. 

<p><li>Reagan wanted the National Endowment for the Humanities cut by 23 percent in his first budget, but achieved 20 percent. This Congress cut it by 36 percent.

<p><li>Reagan proposed to cut mass transit subsidies by 10 percent; this Congress cut them by 43 percent.

<p><li>Congress cut the Appalachian Regional Commission by 39 percent and the Legal Services Corporation by 33 percent. Both agencies were slated for termination by the Reagan Administration and by this Congress, but both survived, albeit with significant reductions in funding. 

<p><li>HUD's budget was cut by $2.6 billion -- or by 10 percent compared with spending for the previous year. 

<p><li>Both this Congress and the Reagan Administration failed in their plans to eliminate the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which once again demonstrated its impressive skills at self-preservation, but this Congress made a real and deep cut. Reagan proposed a 25 percent cut, but CPB's budget rose $10 million in his first year. This Congress substantially reduced CPB's spending last year through the rescission process, cutting planned spending by $37 million in 1996 and $55 million in 1997.</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


As a result of these and hundreds of other cuts, freezes, and terminations, this year's budget deficit is expected to total $146.3 billion, in contrast to the $193.8 billion expected for this year by President Clinton as part of his budget plan in 1993, and the $196 billion projected in the FY 1996 baseline. Importantly, three-quarters of this deficit improvement is due to the spending reductions enacted by the 104th Congress. As noted earlier, FY 1996's projected deficit will be the lowest since President Reagan's FY 1982 budget.
<p>

<b>HOW CLINTON HAS TRIED TO STOP ENTITLEMENT REFORM</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Obviously, the deficit would have been much lower had Congress been as successful with the federal entitlement programs as it was with the discretionary spending accounts. Unfortunately, multiple vetoes by the President of repeated congressional efforts to enact reforms in major entitlement programs like welfare, Medicare, and Medicaid have left federal spending higher than it could have been and rendered future reform efforts more difficult.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	But in welfare, at least, the congressional emphasis on welfare reform, including its passage by the House as part of the Contract with America, has encouraged many states to press the White House for waivers of current rules to enable these states to reform their welfare systems along the lines proposed by the House and Senate. President Clinton, fortunately, has agreed to many of these waiver requests.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	As a result of these reforms, and despite the lackluster national economy, the number of Americans on welfare has fallen by 1.3 million between 1993 and the present, for an overall decline of 9 percent. <sup>2</sup> Since taking office, Wisconsin's Governor Tommy Thompson has effectively reformed his state's welfare program and reduced caseloads by 40 percent.Unfortunately, President Clinton has blocked the rapid expansion of successful state programs like Wisconsin's to the rest of the nation by vetoing federal welfare reform legislation that would have removed the need for cumbersome waiver requests.
<p>

<b>PRIVATIZATION FINALLY MOVES FORWARD</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Perhaps in no other area was the difference between past and present performance as dramatic as it was in the 104th Congress's success in privatizing government-run enterprises. Spurred forward by the House Speaker's appointment of Representative Scott Klug (R-WI) to head up the House's privatization effort, numerous privatizations have been successfully concluded, often with bipartisan support and White House cooperation.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	The Reagan Administration was able to privatize only Conrail and the National Consumer Cooperative Bank, because of intense congressional opposition during the 1980s. But in one year, this Congress has enacted legislation to privatize four major government programs. Although first proposed and developed in the mid-1980s by the Reagan Administration, it took this Congress to pass the legislation (which the President signed into law) to privatize the U.S. Enrichment Corporation, the Naval Petroleum Reserve, and the Alaska Power Marketing Administration. Passed by the House and awaiting action in the Senate is legislation to privatize the government's National Helium Reserve in Texas. Although final transfer prices remain to be determined, the estimated revenues to the federal treasury from these four sales will be several billion dollars.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	In addition to these asset sales, this Congress has initiated many contracting out opportunities which will allow the government to provide better services at lower costs. During the first session, for example, Congress enacted legislation to contract out the Internal Revenue Service's debt collection efforts, the General Services Administration's commercial real estate brokerage functions, the special forecasting functions of the National Weather Service, and selective map-making functions throughout the federal establishment.

	Perhaps encouraged by the more favorable privatization environment in Congress, the Clinton Administration dusted off and improved a Reagan Administration proposal -- called Fed Co-Op -- to set in motion an employee buyout of the background investigations functions previously provided by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management.<sup>3</sup>  Involving approximately 700 federal employees, and structured as an employee stock ownership plan with a projected 90 percent employee ownership share, the transfer is scheduled to take place in mid-July. Unfortunately, there are concerns that some House lawmakers may attempt to thwart it in an effort to preserve the civil service status    quo.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	More generally, Congress included in this year's defense authorization bill (Section 357 of P.L. 104-106) language that mandates a more systematic appraisal of contracting opportunities within the Department of Defense (DOD). Although Defense has been one of the few government agencies to take advantage of contracting opportunities, much more could be done. DOD estimates that its cost savings through contracting have averaged 31 percent on contract competitions between 1978 and 1994, and that the savings now total nearly $1.5 billion per year. <sup>4</sup> 
<p>

<b>OTHER POLICY CHANGES</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Both the telcommunications and agriculture sectors of the economy were the targets of significant legislative reforms that will place more responsibility and decision making in the hands of private participants operating in the competitive marketplace. And just getting underway in Congress are a series of efforts to overhaul the federal government's involvement in virtually all facets of America's national and local transportation systems. Perhaps indicative of the shape this effort will ultimately take are some innovative pieces of legislation that have been or soon will be introduced in Congress. These include prospective legislation that would devolve much of the federal highway program to the states, as well as existing legislation that would privatize the airports, transfer Amtrak responsibilities to regional compacts created by the states, and remove the trouble-plagued Federal Aviation Administration from the Department of Transportation.
<p>

<b>THE UNFINISHED BUSINESS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

 As impressive as this Congress's performance was, it has only made a dent in the massive waste and redundancy that pervades the federal government. As noted earlier, largely untouched were the costly entitlement programs for welfare, Medicaid, and Medicare. These should be revisited during the FY 1997 budget process and should be campaign issues at all levels of government.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Furthermore, opportunities for extensive and cost-saving privatization remain, with the four power marketing administrations prime candidates for commercialization and self-sufficiency. Potential revenues to the government from their sale have been estimated at between $8 billion and $20 billion.<sup>5</sup>  Other areas for privatization include all facets of government's role in the transportation sector, including airports, air traffic control, highways, mass transit, and Amtrak. And building on the progress described earlier, Congress and the Administration should be more aggressive in seeking contracting opportunities to improve service at reduced costs. As noted in a Heritage study published last year, budgetary savings of at least $9 billion per year could be achieved through contracting.<sup>6</sup> 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	 Finally, and notwithstanding the impressive reforms made in the thousands of discretionary government programs, much more could and should be done. Savings of an additional $20 billion should be the goal of the FY 1997 budget. As a casual reading of the hundreds of reports produced by the government's Inspectors General reveals, waste and mismanagement are still pervasive throughout the federal establishment and have largely survived the first round of budget cuts. Indeed, there is recent evidence to suggest that in response to budget cuts, government bureaucracies have engaged in the traditional "Washington Monument" ploy -- cut services to the public instead of making efficiencies in program overhead.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	For example, the National Park Service has been highly resistant to the use of contractors to provide routine services such as entrance fee collection, janitorial work, and campground management, preferring instead to use more costly uniformed personnel to perform these services. As a result, and in response to limits placed on the growth of its budget, the Park Service has announced a series of service cutbacks in the form of reduced hours and closed campgrounds just as vacation season is getting underway. Such bureaucratic games should not be tolerated by Congress. Lawmakers should require the Park Service to seek savings through management efficiencies rather than service cutbacks. 
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The record of the last year's budget battle clearly demonstrates that, although the tactical victory may belong to the President, the strategic victory belongs to the 104th Congress. Many of its members, particulary the freshmen, arrived in Washington with an electoral mandate to cut the budget. It was a mandate they honored, and in doing so they accomplished the first reduction in discretionary spending since 1969.

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Within the next few weeks, the U.S. Senate will have an opportunity to achieve genuine reform of transportation policy. But <a href="http://rs9.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d104:s.00729:">S. 729</a>, a bill that would remove the transportation trust funds from the budget and from meaningful congressional oversight, is flawed and would not lead to needed reform. A preferable alternative would be legislative proposals now being prepared in the Senate that would return the highway programs to the states and allow them to collect the existing fuel tax and use it to finance transportation projects of their choosing. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Sponsored by Senators Trent Lott (R-MS) and Max Baucus (D-MT), the Trust Fund Restoration Act of 1995 (S. 729) would give federal highway spending budgetary exemptions and protections that even Social Security does not now have.<sup>1</sup>  Thus enactment of S. 729 would be a missed opportunity for the Senate to redesign and localize government involvement in areas vital to the health of the economy. At a time when transportation problems increasingly are local in nature, today's centrally directed Eisenhower-era program offers no solutions. S. 729 would do nothing to alter that deficiency.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The House version of the bill (<a href="http://rs9.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d104:h.r.00842:">H.R. 842</a> -- surprisingly entitled the Truth in Budgeting Act) passed the House this April. But many of those who voted for it did so in the belief that the bill would die, or at least be purged of its worst excesses, in the Senate. Unfortunately, they and the taxpayers may be very disappointed, because the process in the Senate is beginning to look like a scramble by special interests to obtain additional budgetary privileges. Already legislation has been introduced in the Senate (S.1395), sponsored by Senator William Roth (R-DE), to turn Amtrak into an entitlement by creating for it the Intercity Passenger Rail Trust Fund. The Fund would be financed by diverting 0.5 cents of the 18.4 cents now collected by the federal fuel tax for the other transportation trust funds. That such a tax could be proposed to finance one of the government's more questionable activities reflects the growing aggressiveness of taxpayer-dependent industries as they try to place a lock on the public's money.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The enactment of S. 729 would be an enormous obstacle to transportation reform. Instead of hiding the program by moving it off budget, Congress should turn its attention to solutions that are local in emphasis, and should work cooperatively with the Budget Committee, the governors, and reformers in the House and Senate to develop a reform package that will better address the transportation needs of the country.
<P>
<b>WHAT IS WRONG WITH S. 729</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Trust Fund Restoration Act (S. 729) would exempt all of the transportation trust funds from all of the key control provisions of the congressional budget process. These include budget caps that limit discretionary budget authority and outlays, pay-as-you-go rules, Gramm-Rudman-Hollings sequestration, and any other statutory budget limitations.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Sponsors contend that the special budgetary privileges S. 729 would grant are essential to protect federal highway and other transportation spending from congressional budget cutters who might want to divert the $20 billion-plus in revenues raised by the federal fuel tax to deficit reduction or to other programs. But insulating the trust fund from budget scrutiny would make it more difficult for Congress to set clear budget priorities. Moreover, experience demonstrates that the risk of a congressional diversion of trust fund money to other purposes is overstated. In fact, federal highway programs have benefited from federal spending well in excess of the dedicated fuel tax receipts allocated to the trust fund. Since 1957, total federal spending on highways has exceeded highway trust fund receipts by more than $37 billion, making the diversion of highway revenues to other programs unlikely. <a href="ib225t1.gif">Table 1</a> presents a year-by-year analysis of highway receipts and spending.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Enactment of the bill would set back the prospects for transportation reform, regional equity, and honest budgeting. With the highway trust fund moved off budget, highway spending would be given preferential treatment and, unlike other programs, would be absolved from making any sacrifices in order to achieve fiscal restraint and a robust economy. Specifically:
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The bill would make it more difficult to achieve sound public finance decisions because it would allow lawmakers to avoid hard budget choices. Lawmakers should have to decide whether pork-barrel highway spending should be more important than spending for national security or programs targeted to the needy and disabled. The legislation would allow them to avoid making such choices in the case of highway spending.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
What is left of the federal budget would understate federal spending and taxes. By essentially removing highway funding from the normal presentation of the budget, the legislation would understate the size of the federal government. In FY 1996, some $302 billion, or 19.2 percent of spending, was already off-budget. S. 729 would add another $30 billion-$35 billion to that figure.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Highway programs would be removed from ongoing congressional oversight, and the outdated and inequitable allocation of pay-in and pay-out by the states would be preserved. In the current allocation scheme, the 27 donor states that subsidize the 23 recipient states (and the District of Columbia) would remain unchanged. <a href="ib225t2.gif">Table 2</a> presents the states by gain or loss, with several states such as Florida, Georgia, and Kentucky receiving from the trust fund less than three-quarters of the share paid in.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The highway program would be exempted from the budget's discretionary spending caps. This would reduce the annual appropriations process for transportation programs to an empty exercise because any actions taken would not count for purposes of budget scorekeeping or deficit reduction. Furthermore, this diminished congressional oversight would take away the incentive to improve a program that has not changed fundamentally since its origins in the 1950s, and would make more difficult the development and enactment of any of the reform proposals to transfer, devolve, block grant, or give back some or all of the highway revenue and spending authority to the states. Once the program is moved off budget and no longer is subject to annual budget review or periodic authorization, Congress would have fewer scheduled opportunities to review and improve it, and, therefore, fewer opportunities to effect needed reforms.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This final point is critical. Enactment of S. 729 would make it extremely difficult to reform outdated and ineffective transportation policies. Putting the program off budget and no longer subject to regular congressional review, authorization, and appropriation means that several prominent proposals to shift more of the resources and program management to the states would face greater obstacles to serious consideration and enactment. Such devolution is needed. With the interstate highway system completed, and with most transportation problems now largely local in nature, a centralized program operated by a Washington bureaucracy makes no sense.
<p>
<b>AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Rather than weaken the oversight of highway programs and insulate them from budget review, the Senate should be seeking ways to devolve those programs to the states, where local taxpayers and elected officials can better determine how to get full value for the money.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Proposals include the modest reforms endorsed by the Step 21 Coalition (representing 22 states). The Coalition plan would streamline highway program procedures, make more equitable the allocation of funds among states, and preserve the integrity of trust fund receipts, among other goals. But more comprehensive and better targeted to the needs of the states is legislation soon to be introduced by Senator Connie Mack (R-FL). Under Mack's "give-back" plan, all states would be given the right to collect the fuel tax and spend the receipts on transportation projects of their choosing, without interference from the federal bureaucracy or politically influentialspecial interests.<sup>2</sup>  The Mack plan would limit future federal highway involvement to the maintenance and improvement, as needed, of the existing interstate highway system and would limit the federal fuel tax to the revenues needed to meet this specific objective.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Devolution of highway funding to the states is long overdue. Washington's continued involvement in transportation substantially raises the costs of local highway projects. The federal mandates that accompany money from Washington mean that narrow yet influential constituent groups, such as organized labor and highway construction and material supply companies, benefit enormously at huge cost to taxpayers.<sup>3</sup>  One such feature of federal policy that benefits organized labor is the Davis-Bacon Act, which is attached to the highway program. This Act requires that workers on all federally financed highway construction projects be paid wages that often are 20 percent to 40 percent higher than local norms. It is estimated that this provision alone adds $202 million per year in unnecessary costs just to California's highway program.<sup>4</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Spending approximately $20 billion per year in both large and small construction projects, the highway trust fund is far and away the country's largest source of civilian pork-barrel spending. Various interest groups, companies, and industries that benefit from its current mode of operation understandably perceive any movement away from the status quo as a threat to their long-established lucrative relationships with government. This is why lobbyists for construction companies are mounting such an effort to gain passage of legislation to move the trust fund off budget. The Senate should not bow to this pressure. Instead, it should craft legislation that continues oversight and budget control, and begins the transfer to the states of responsibility for highways and the finances to pay for them.
<p>

<b>TECHNICAL NOTES</b>
<p>
<a href="ib225t1.gif">Table 1</a>
<p>
Source: Columns titled General Fund Appropriations, Highway Trust Fund Expenditures, and Total Federal Expenditures - All Highways are from <I>Highway Statistics</I>, as reprinted in a memorandum dated April 15, 1995, from John W. Fischer and William A. Lipford of the Congressional Research Service to the Honorable Nick Smith on the subject of "General fund spending for highways."  Column titled Highway Trust Fund Receipts is derived from <I>Historical Tables, Budget of the United States Government, Fiscal Year 1997</I> (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1996), Table 2-4, pp. 34-39. Column titled Excess Highway Spending is the difference between receipts (col. 3) and total expenditures (col. 4).
<p>
<a href="ib225t2.gif">Table 2</a>
<p>
This presentation and return ratio differs from that presented in Table FE221, which purports to show that all states, except Kentucky, received a greater share of funds than they contribute, an outcome that is mathematically impossible. This DOT misrepresentation of state status is accomplished by comparing actual current fuel tax payments into the fund with prospective spending from the fund, with the latter always larger than the former because it includes interest earnings and unexpended balances in the fund, an apples-and-oranges relationship. Table 1 presents the same information but in a way that compares apples to apples (or grapes to grapes) by measuring the share paid in with the share paid out. For example, in the case of Kansas, the table indicates that its payment into the fund accounted for 1.159 percent of fund revenues but that it received only 0.96 percent of spending, making it a donor state, while Pennsylvania accounted for 4.7 percent of revenues but received 4.9 percent of spending, making it a recipient state. All states in bold type are donor states.

Within the next few days, the 104th Congress will decide whether it will attempt to reform transportation policy or whether it will permanently preserve the status quo. The mistitled <a href="http://rs9.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/1?c104:./temp/~c10421OA::">Truth in Budgeting Act (H.R. 842)</a>, which would move the highway trust fund off budget, would be a missed opportunity for Congress to redesign and localize government involvement in areas vital to the health of the economy.

<b><li>The highway program would be removed from the annual appropriations process and congressional oversight, taking away the incentive to improve a program that has not changed fundamentally since its origins in the 1950s.</b> The diminished oversight that accompanies a shift off budget would make more difficult the development and enactment of any of the reform proposals to transfer, devolve, block grant or give back some or all of the highway revenue and spending authority to the states. Once the program is moved off budget and no longer is subject to annual budget review or periodic authorization, Congress would have fewer scheduled opportunities to review and improve the program, and, therefore, fewer opportunities to subject it to needed reform.
</ol> <p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This final point is critical. H.R. 842 would make it extremely difficult to reform outdated and ineffective transportation policies. Putting the program off budget and no longer subject to regular congressional review, authorization, and appropriation means that several prominent proposals to shift more of the resources and program management to the states would face greater obstacles to serious consideration and ultimate enactment. Such devolution is needed. With the interstate highway system completed and with most transportation problems now largely local in nature, a centralized program operated by a Washington bureaucracy makes no sense.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The proposals include the modest reforms endorsed by the Step 21 Coalition (representing 22 states), which would streamline highway program procedures, make more equitable the allocation of funds among states, and preserve the integrity of trust fund receipts, among other goals. More comprehensive and better targeted to the needs of the states is legislation soon to be introduced by Senator Connie Mack (R-FL). Under Senator Mack's "give-back" plan, all states would be given the right to collect the fuel tax and spend the receipts on transportation projects of their choosing, without interference from the federal bureaucracy or the politically influential  special interests.<sup>1</sup>  The Senator's plan would limit future federal highway involvement to the maintenance and improvement, as needed, of the existing interstate highway system.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Washington's continued involvement in transportation substantially raises the costs of local highway projects. The imposition of federal mandates means that narrow, yet influential, constituent groups, such as organized labor and highway construction and material supply companies, benefit financially.<sup>2</sup>  One such feature of federal policy that benefits organized labor is the Davis-Bacon Act, which is attached to the highway program. This Act requires that workers on all federally financed highway construction projects be paid wages that often are 20 percent to 40 percent higher than local norms. It is estimated that this provision alone adds $202 million per year in unnecessary costs just to California's highway program.<sup>3</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Spending approximately $20 billion per year in both large and small construction projects, the highway trust fund is far and away the country's largest source of civilian pork-barrel spending. Various interest groups, companies, and industries that benefit from its current mode of operation understandably perceive any movement away from the status quo as a risk to their long-established lucrative relationships with government. This is why lobbyists for construction companies are mounting such an effort to gain passage of legislation to move the trust fund off budget.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In a recent interview, T. Peter Ruane, President of the American Road & Transportation Builders and the leader of the industry coalition backing H.R. 842, claimed that there were 230 strong votes for the bill "and another 40 we think we can deliver."<sup>4</sup>  Taxpayers should hope that Ruane is wrong and that there are enough Members of Congress who realize that H.R. 842 would be an enormous obstacle to transportation reform. Instead of hiding the program by moving it off budget, Congress should turn its attention to solutions that are local in emphasis, and should work cooperatively with the Senate, the states, the House Budget Committee, and the Transportation Subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee to develop a reform package that will better address the transportation needs of the country.

This presentation and return ratio differs from that presented in Table FE221, which purports to show that all states, except Kentucky, received a greater share of funds than they contribute, an outcome that is mathematically impossible. This DOT misrepresentation of state status is accomplished by comparing actual current fuel tax payments into the fund with prospective spending from the fund, with the latter always larger than the former because it includes interest earnings and unexpended balances in the fund, an apple to oranges relationship. Table 1 presents the same information but in a way that compares apples to apples (or grapes to grapes) by measuring the share paid in with the share paid out. For example, in the case of Kansas, the table indicates that its payment into the fund accounted for 1.159 percent of fund revenues, but received only 0.96 percent of spending, making it a donor state, while Pennsylvania accounted for 4.7 percent of revenues, but received 4.9 percent of spending, making it a recipient state.

<h3><i>HOW TO CLOSE DOWN THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY</i></h3>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
The <a href="http://www.doe.gov">U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)</a> was created as a Cabinet-level department in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter as part of the federal effort to address the energy crisis of the late 1970s. Fearing that international energy shortages were the wave of the future, the President felt a highly visible national agency was necessary to promote energy conservation, control federal supplies of power, and develop alternative sources of energy. However, the OPEC oil embargo then collapsed -- without any assistance from the DOE -- and international oil supplies stabilized. 
<p>
And yet, the department remains. In fact, DOE has grown in tax dollars spent and functions performed -- the result of 15 years of searching for something to do. As Victor Rezendes of the General Accounting Office has testified, "DOE's mission and priorities have changed dramatically over time so that the Department is now very different from what it was in 1977. While energy research, conservation and policy-making dominated early DOE priorities, weapons production and now environmental cleanup overshadow its budget."<sup>1</sup>  Thanks to this continual empire-building, the department's budget has increased by 235 percent, and 85 percent today is spent on activities other than energy resources. For instance, nearly $12 billion is budgeted annually for environmental quality and nuclear waste disposal, with close to another $3 billion earmarked for fundamental science research.
<p>
The Department of Energy not only has strayed from its original mission of energy oversight, but also has failed to conduct efficiently the services it now provides. Vice President Al Gore's National Performance Review reported that due to inefficiencies as high as 40 percent within DOE's Environmental Management program, more than $70 billion could be lost over the next 30 years.<sup>2</sup>  Victor Rezendes testified that "DOE suffers from significant management problems, ranging from poor environmental management... to major internal inefficiencies rooted in poor oversight.... "<sup>3</sup>. These management problems and the inefficiencies that flow from them have been caused largely by DOE's continual efforts to re-align itself and justify its existence.<p>It is time to close the Department of Energy. Senator Rod Grams (R-MN) and Representative Todd Tiahrt (R-KS) have developed legislation that would dismantle the department.<sup>4</sup>  Title I of both bills redesignates the Department of Energy as the "Energy Programs Resolution Agency," modeled after the Resolution Trust Corporation, created by Congress to dispose of the assets of failed thrift institutions closed in the late 1980s. Both bills would establish a three-year limit for closing DOE, privatize Energy's valuable oil reserves and other assets, establish a commission to recommend DOE laboratory privatizations, set new guidelines for toxic waste disposal, and transfer control over the nuclear weapons stockpile to the Department of Defense.
<p>
Under a plan developed by analysts at <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a>, DOE's defense-related programs would be transferred to an agency under the jurisdiction of the Department of Defense, and its primary research functions would be transferred to universities or the National Science Foundation.<sup>5</sup>  Federal funding for commercially oriented energy supply, research, and development projects would be terminated, and the research responsibility would be transferred to the private sector. All commercial energy functions, including the Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs), Petroleum Reserves, and Uranium Enrichment activities, would be denationalized and sold to the private sector.
<p>
Specifically, under the Heritage Plan, Congress would:
<p><ul>
<li> Transfer all defense-related nuclear weapons functions to a new agency within the Department of Defense. This new agency would have primary management and oversight responsibility for environmental cleanup activities.
<p>
<li> Decrease the Department of Energy's <a href="http://www.em.doe.gov">environmental management</a> budget by 30 percent and adopt as the program's objective the maximum overall reduction in risk to the populace for every dollar spent.
<p>
<li> Establish the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management as a federal corporation with the ultimate goal of full privatization.
<p>
<li> Terminate all Energy Supply Research and Development programs and privatize the government-owned laboratories engaged in this research.
<p>
<li> Terminate all Energy Conservation funding, including state grants and research programs.
<p>
<li> Phase out federal funding for General Science and Basic Research and transfer the laboratories conducting this research to the universities currently operating them.
<p>
<li> Sell the Strategic Petroleum Reserves to the private sector.
<p>
<li> Sell the Naval Petroleum Reserves to the private sector.
<p>
<li> Sell the U.S. Uranium Enrichment Corporation to the private sector.
<p>
<li> Sell the five Power Marketing Administrations to the private sector, using a variety of stock sale approaches.
<p>
<li> Make the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission an independent agency.
<p>
<li> Close down or privatize the <a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/">Energy Information Administration</a>.
</ul><p>
Closing the department and making the related reforms would save American taxpayers more than $41 billion over the next five years, including $16 billion in asset sales. By contrast, Secretary Hazel O'Leary's "re-invention" plan would save only $14.1 billion over five years, including $5.7 billion in asset sales. The proposals to close the department developed by Senator Grams and Representative Tiahrt would save more than $17 billion over five years.
<p>
There are two ways to close down a federal department. The first is simply to shift the department's responsibilities to other agencies and throw the old letterhead into the trash. The alternative is to eliminate, devolve, or privatize responsibilities whenever possible, and transfer only essential responsibilities to other departments. This latter approach is the one that should be used with the Department of Energy. DOE's history of failure and ineffectiveness demands nothing less.

<p>
<b>CHANGING MISSIONS AND BUREAUCRATIC GROWTH</b>
<p>
Created in 1977, the Department of Energy has changed missions numerous times over its almost two decades. Its original mission -- administering the complex set of regulations, price controls, and allocation laws established in response to the OPEC oil embargo of 1973-1974 -- was a dismal failure that actually resulted in higher energy costs and increased dependence on foreign oil.<sup>6</sup><p>Ronald Reagan promised during his 1980 campaign to eliminate the Department of Energy. Instead, he changed its mission from energy conservation, imposed through a centralized structure of regulations, to energy promotion by means of market mechanisms. The department also gained responsibility for the production of nuclear weapons during the 1980s because of a belief that production and stockpile management should be controlled by a civilian agency.
<p>
DOE's central mission changed once again with the end of the Cold War. The high level of weapons production was no longer necessary, and world energy supplies remained constant. Ever vigilant about finding a purpose, DOE began to concentrate on environmental remediation of past actions, including cleaning up its own contaminated weapons facilities. DOE's fiscal 1996 budget request makes this change in mission clear. Thirty-nine percent of the $17.8 billion budget request is earmarked for "Environmental Quality," while only 15 percent is for "Energy Resources."<sup>7</sup>  Another large portion of Energy's budget is dedicated to research and development of alternative-source energy supply, including solar, wind, geothermal, and nuclear power generation (see <a href="bg1061c2.gif">Chart 2</a>). Despite this massive effort, petroleum and coal remain the dominant sources of power in America.
<p>
DOE's newest initiative, the fourth change in mission, is the creation of Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs). These "agreements" are contracts whereby the Department of Energy allows individual companies to use federal laboratories, and even conducts research and development, all at taxpayer expense. CRADAs are meant to increase the competitiveness of American companies and support quality jobs at a time when much of the defense-related work completed at DOE's laboratories in the past is no longer seen as necessary. CRADAs thus offer the dual advantage of providing private companies with free research while preventing the closing of federal facilities -- or so proponents argue.
<p>
The Department of Energy's CRADA initiatives are among the most egregious examples of corporate welfare that benefits individual companies at tremendous expense to American taxpayers. According to a recent series on "High-Tech Handouts" in the <i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i>, researchers who once worked for a private company are now employed by DOE but continue to do the same work. The only thing that has changed is that taxpayers are picking up the tab.<sup>8</sup>  Moreover, when this research is successful, individual companies can earn protected trade secrets or patents that often are not available even to the federal government. Millions of American taxpayers thus may be underwriting a single company's market position. <p> The results of most efforts are both disappointing and expensive. For example, the <i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i> notes that DOE has spent some $792 million on CRADAs between 1992 and 1995. The result has been 46 new companies at a cost of $17 million per company.<sup>9</sup>  Even more disappointing, many recipients of DOE assistance are reducing their research and development budgets and trimming their workforces. General Electric, which earned $4.7 billion in profits in 1994, received $25.4 million in federal assistance between 1990 and 1994. Over the same period, GE cut 80,000 positions from its payroll. Clearly, DOE's CRADA program is not meeting its stated goal of job creation.
<p>

<b>HOW TO CLOSE DOWN THE DEPARTMENT</b>
<p>
There is no legitimate rationale for a Department of Energy. Centralized planning of energy production and distribution, including operation of the Power Marketing Administrations, has proven ineffective and expensive. Mass-scale nuclear weapons production is no longer needed with the end of the Cold War. Environmental remediation efforts have been inefficient and often impractical. And efforts to bolster private industry through CRADAs are expensive, ineffective, and fast becoming a primary source of congressional earmarking and corporate welfare. All defense-related functions now being administered by DOE, including environmental remediation, should be transferred to the Department of Defense. All assets that are commercially viable should be privatized. Whatever remains should be terminated (see Table 1).
<p>
<b>Environmental Cleanup</b>
<p>
The Department of Energy was responsible for the production of nuclear weapons during the Cold War, and the pressure of competing with the Soviet Union prevented environmental protection from being a top priority at weapons production facilities. Today, although production has ceased, the environmental remediation of DOE's facilities remains. The vast majority of contamination problems at the department's nuclear weapons plants involve some level of radioactivity. Since 1989, the department has managed, stored, and cleaned up hazardous wastes produced at the plants under the Environmental Management (EM) program, which has three basic components:  Environmental Restoration, Waste Management, and Facility Transition and Management (created in 1992).
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p><ul>
<li>Move the Department of Energy's environmental management responsibilities to a new independent agency within the Department of Defense.
<p>
<li>Adopt as the program's objective the maximum overall reduction in risk to the populace for every dollar spent.
</ul><p>
<b>Savings from the Heritage Proposal:</b>
<p>
Rationale:  Since its inception in 1989, DOE's Environmental Management program has almost quadrupled its budget to a fiscal 1996 request of $6.6 billion. The General Accounting Office estimates that the total cost of remediation at federal nuclear waste disposal sites will run as high as $200 billion.<sup>10</sup>  However, given DOE's poor performance in the past, this could be only a fraction of the eventual total. DOE also should re-evaluate its original goals and strategies for dealing with this problem. This is not to imply that contamination of these sites is insignificant. To the contrary, the amount of radioactive and hazardous waste at the Department of Energy's nuclear weapons complex is so great that more effective action is absolutely essential.
<p>
The Environmental Management program was supposed to clean up all sites within 30 years. Agreements signed by DOE, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and state regulatory agencies specify requirements and set milestones for achieving those requirements. Unfortunately, however, the costs of cleanup have escalated rapidly, breakthroughs in technology have not occurred at the pace originally estimated, and the nature and scope of the contamination problem simply are not known. "As a result," notes the General Accounting Office, these cleanup "agreements taken together do not reflect a national strategy of targeting resources based on the highest risks to human health and the environment."<sup>11</sup>  It is now clear that DOE will not be able to clean up the sites either within the 30-year time frame or any time soon thereafter.<p>Much of the problem lies with the assumptions that were made in setting these goals. The focus has been on timelines for reducing contamination rather than on the more sensible goal of reducing risk to human health and safety to the maximum extent possible for any given level of funding. This "biggest bang for the buck" approach would save far more lives at far less cost. For instance, if a site poses little threat to the local population, it may be better to delay cleanup until it becomes a higher priority. This would allow funds to be spent on sites that pose a more likely threat. Additionally, since the value of money is a function of time (how far in the future it is spent), cleanups would cost relatively less in the future -- especially if new technologies are invented. Alternative strategies such as land use controls also might encourage more effective cleanup decisions.
<p>
Both the Grams and Tiahrt bills contain solid provisions for prioritizing remediation actions at the various contamination sites. First they would transfer cleanup responsibilities to a civilian office within the Department of Defense. Then clear goals for reducing overall risks to public health would be adopted to ensure that the most dangerous sites are cleaned up first. These sensible reorganization and prioritization plans would ensure an efficient yet effective process of remediation.
<p>
<b>Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management</b>
<p>
The Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM) is charged with constructing a permanent repository for the nuclear waste generated at civilian nuclear power plants. In the past, this material has been stored "on-site."  Realizing the danger to residents of surrounding areas, Congress in 1982 passed the Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA), which mandated the construction of a single storage site that could hold all of the nation's nuclear waste beginning in 1998.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p><ul>
<li>Reconstitute OCRWM as a mixed government-private corporation as a first step toward full privatization.<sup>12</sup><p><li>Redefine the new corporation's mission to concentrate on interim rather than permanent storage.<p><li>Establish concrete goals leading to the commencement of storage in 1998.<p></ul>Rationale:  The Department of Energy's efforts to create a safe and permanent repository have been dismal from the start. DOE has spent more than $4 billion just to study the viability of the proposed Yucca Mountain repository in Nevada and estimates that another $2.3 billion will be necessary over the next 15 years. The construction, maintenance, and operation of the future repository will cost an estimated $30 billion. Meanwhile, the General Accounting Office now estimates that storage cannot begin until 2023.<sup>13</sup>  In other words, for every year OCRWM has been in existence, it has fallen a year behind schedule.
<p>
These inefficiencies are attributable primarily to two factors. First, the National Waste Policy Act specifically requires the permanent, rather than temporary, storage of nuclear wastes. This has added great costs to the investigation process and will add even more to the future cost of storage and maintenance. Several proposals over the years, including Senator Grams's legislation and this year's House-passed appropriations bill, require the federal government to consider interim storage.<sup>14</sup>  This would allow storage and waste consolidation to begin in the near future. It also would allow for more detailed research and development into viable options for permanent storage.<p>Second, the program's organizational structure reflects many of the inefficiencies that haunt the Department of Energy in general:  excessively high expenses, scheduling lapses, poor contractor management, and a politically charged environment. Numerous studies over the past decade have commented on these problems and suggested that their cause is OCRWM's position within the Department of Energy. As early as 1984, only two years after the office was created, a report to the Secretary of Energy found that "Location of OCRWM within the Department of Energy makes it vulnerable to changes of policy and senior management as Administrations come and go."<sup>15</sup>  Studies generally have suggested that OCRWM be moved out of the Department of Energy and given the freedom to operate without political constraints.<sup>16 </sup><p>It is widely felt that the dangers presented by the transportation and storage of nuclear waste justify both stringent federal oversight of OCRWM and the timely and cost-effective construction of a nuclear waste repository. In the short term, both goals can be accomplished by creating a mixed government-private corporation. Such an organization would retain government oversight to ensure safety while allowing for efficiencies associated with private-sector incentives. In the long run, full privatization w
ill encourage the most efficient waste disposal by eliminating government interference in day-to-day operations. Safety standards could still be enforced through stringent congressional oversight.
<p>
Neither congressional proposal addresses the future of OCRWM privatization. Instead, control over civilian nuclear waste disposal is given to the Army Corps of Engineers. Given the long history of failure within the Army Corps,<sup>17</sup> it is disturbing that both Senator Grams and Representative Tiahrt would give it such a sensitive responsibility. It also does not seem likely that simply transferring its responsibilities to another government organization will solve the office's structural deficiencies.
<p>
High-Energy Science Research<sup>18</sup><br>The Department of Energy spends over $1.1 billion per year on basic research in high-energy physics, nuclear physics, and other general science programs. Many of these projects, such as the recently terminated <a href="http://www.ssc.gov">Superconducting Super Collider</a>, are considered "big science" because they require large and expensive facilities and teams of researchers.
<p>
The department owns nearly 30 research facilities around the country, nearly all of them managed and operated under contract by universities and private organizations. Of these facilities, 17 direct most of their programming to basic science and technology, high-energy physics, or nuclear physics research. Five are multi-program laboratories like <a href="http://www.anl.gov">Argonne</a> near Chicago; <a href="http://suntid.bnl.gov:8080/bnl.html">Brookhaven</a> in Upton, New York; and <a href="http://www.llnl.gov/">Lawrence Livermore</a> in Berkeley, California. Another 12 are specialized, or "program-dedicated."  These include Fermilab near Chicago; the <a href="http://www.slac.stanford.edu/">Stanford Linear Accelerator Center</a> near Stanford, California; and the Structural Biology and Molecular Medicine Laboratory (formerly known as the Laboratory of Biomedical and Environmental Sciences) at the University of California at Los Angeles.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p><ul>
<li>Phase out over three years all federal funding for general science and basic research.
<p>
<li>Transfer the federal laboratories conducting this research to the universities currently operating them or sell them to private-sector operators. 
<p>
<li>Shift any remaining funding for basic research to the National Science Foundation. 
<p>
<li>Award all funds based on competitive bids.
<p></ul>
<b>Savings from the Heritage Proposal:</b>
<p>
Rationale:  Many of the laboratories now owned by the Department of Energy were established during World War II in conjunction with the Manhattan Project, which resulted in the world's first atomic bomb. Since then, they have "expanded their missions to encompass civilian research and development in many disciplines -- from high-energy physics to advanced computing," reports the GAO; but because of DOE mismanagement, "the multi-program laboratories -- both individually and as a group -- do not have either clearly defined missions or specific implementation strategies that bring together laboratory resources to focus on accomplishing departmental objectives or national goals."<sup>19</sup>  With no defined mission, other analysts report, these laboratories often compete directly with the private sector.<p>More surprising is the amount of money DOE has spent subsidizing private companies. For instance, the department has spent more than $5.2 billion on "technology transfer" programs. Secretary of Energy Hazel O'Leary defends this by stating, "It's about jobs; it's about creating jobs. If we don't create jobs, then it's a failure."  As two <i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i> reporters note, "By O'Leary's own measure then, it's a flop."<sup>20</sup>  Between 1990 and 1994, for example, the federal government, largely through the DOE laboratories, transferred $293.1 million to eight large companies with annual revenues of $700 billion. Yet, over the same four-year period, these eight firms reduced their U.S. payrolls by 329,438 positions and their research and development budgets by $516 million (two dollars for every dollar of government subsidy).<sup>21</sup><p>Numerous studies, including the recent Galvin Commission report, have made recommendations to DOE on how to focus the work of these laboratories, but the department has failed to do so. Indeed, many laboratory managers report that the Energy bureaucracy often stands in the way of scientific progress. These managers "view DOE's day-to-day management as costly a
nd unproductive in meeting the laboratories' missions."<sup>22</sup> <p>The only way to free these laboratories from DOE's bureaucratic micromanagement is to sell them to private research firms or transfer them at nominal charge to the universities currently operating them. This would allow these facilities to forge partnerships with other private technology interests or to pursue basic research independent of the political or budgetary process. 
<p>
Federal funding should be phased out over a three-year period to give these facilities time to find other sources of funding. One option would be to use the $1.6 billion realized from selling the Naval Petroleum Reserve to establish an endowment for university basic research facilities, freeing them permanently from the uncertainties of the budget process.
<p>
Both the Grams and Tiahrt proposals would establish a laboratory closure commission, similar to the present military base closure commission, to study the problem and recommend which DOE laboratories (except for those engaged in defense-related activities) should be closed, privatized, or downsized. It is important that Congress establish strict guidelines for the commission so that facilities which remain within the structure of the federal government engage solely in research directly applicable to federal functions. Such guidelines would mandate that all laboratories, regardless of stated mission, are investigated for inefficiencies and wasteful programs.
<p>
<b>Power Marketing Administrations</b>
<p>
The Department of Energy operates five Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) which sell wholesale electricity generated by 131 dams built and maintained by the Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation. These PMAs (Alaska, Bonneville, Southeastern, Southwestern, and Western Area) sold nearly $3 billion worth of electric power in 1994 -- just under 8 percent of all power generated in the United States.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p><ul>
<li>End all federal assistance to the PMAs, including direct appropriations and the authority to borrow from the Treasury.
<p>
<li>Sell the Power Marketing Administrations to private investors through a variety of privatization schemes by the end of 1998. 
<p>
<li>Sell the hydroelectric power plants by the turn of the century.
</ul><p>
<b>Savings from the Heritage Proposal:</b>
<p>
Rationale:  After nearly 50 years of taxpayer subsidies, it is time for the five Power Marketing Administrations to become fully private enterprises. Customers have enjoyed hidden subsidies for years because these government-owned utilities have been able to borrow from the Treasury at below-market interest rates and take as long as 50 years to pay back the loans. Of the more than $16 billion lent to the PMAs by the Treasury, only about 25 percent has been repaid.<sup>23</sup><p>PMA electricity is not sold to the highest bidder. Instead, it is sold at varying rates to municipal utilities, cooperatives, industrial users, other government facilities, and investor-owned utilities. Municipal utilities and rural cooperatives are "preference customers," which means they pay for electricity at cost -- often as little as half the rates paid by customers in other parts of the country. Industrial users have a different rate schedule. Aluminum companies, for example, consume as much as one-third of Bonneville's power, and "the rate they pay is, by contract, tied to aluminum prices."  Thus, when aluminum prices fell over the past five years, Bonneville was buying power "for as much as 3.5 cents a kilowatt hour, [but] it had to sell it to those utilities for 1.8."<sup>24</sup> <p>Selling the PMAs is the only way to bring sound business practices to these government-owned utilities. Congress should follow the example of countries around the world that are moving to privatize their state-owned utilities. In 1993, for instance, Argentina, Germany, and the United Kingdom raised a total of $4.4 billion by selling state-owned electric utilities to private investors -- including U.S. investors. 
<p>
The British experience is particularly relevant to the United States. In 1991, the British government restructured its government-owned electricity-generating facilities into four regional corporations and sold them to the public in a stock offering. These companies compete to offer electricity through a national grid system. They also compete with various small producers. The stock offering included preferential pricing for employees as well as discounts and incentives for electricity customers and small investors. Stock also was offered for purchase on foreign exchanges. This strategy of building support for the sale among employees, customers, and small investors made the sale very popular. The stock offering was heavily oversubscribed and yielded over $6 billion for taxpayers.
<p>
When the Reagan Administration failed to get Congress to act on its 1987 proposal to sell the Alaska and Southeastern PMAs, it tried unsuccessfully to reform the PMAs' debt repayment schedules. This effort has continued under the Bush and Clinton Administrations. This year, the Clinton Administration also is renewing the effort to sell four of the PMAs (excluding Bonneville) for a total of about $3.7 billion. The White House says it will work with Congress to develop specific proposals to privatize these assets. President Clinton's fiscal 1996 budget projects that the Alaska sale could generate $83 million. This sale has been in negotiation for more than six years and could be completed quickly if Congress acts to authorize it.
<p>
The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) estimates that the relatively small Southeastern and Southwestern PMAs could be sold for $500 million each.<sup>25</sup>  The Southeastern PMA, which sells less than 2 percent of the power in its region, could be sold swiftly to regional utilities because it does not own or operate any transmission facilities. It simply pays a fee to various utilities to market power through their transmission lines. The Southwestern PMA, which accounts for 4 percent of the energy sold in its region, also could be sold to regional investor-owned utilities.
<p>
OMB estimates that selling the much larger Western Area PMA (WAPA) headquartered in Golden, Colorado, could generate some $2.6 billion. According to the Department of Energy, while WAPA markets about 9 percent of the power in its region, its service area covers 1.3 million square miles, and its wholesale customers provide power to 16 million consumers in 15 central and western states. Because of its large distribution area, WAPA should be broken up and sold in manageable pieces to investors.
<p>
Selling Bonneville (BPA) would be more complicated because of its size and the fact that it provides about 65 percent of the electric power in the Northwest. One method, used successfully by such countries as Britain, would be to sell through a broad-based stock option plan in order to neutralize opposition from the interests served by Bonneville and win popular support from public investors. Stock could be sold at favorable prices to employees, residential customers, environmentalists, fishing and agricultural interests, or others who may feel they stand to lose from privatization. Such a move also might bring support from the many investor-owned and public utilities in the region which reportedly have threatened to build their own power generators to free themselves from BPA's near-monopoly status.<sup>26</sup><p>Both the Grams and Tiahrt proposals call for immediate sale of the Alaskan, Western, Southwestern, and Southeastern Power Marketing Administrations. This would result in savings of roughly $3 billion over the next five years. In addition, both plans transfer control of the Bonneville Power Marketing Administration to the Department of the Interior and direct the Secretary of Interior to conduct a study outlining future courses for Bonneville.
<p>
<b>Energy Supply Research and Development</b>
<p>
The Department of Energy spends nearly $3.7 billion per year on research designed to develop or improve sources of energy. Initiated in response to the OPEC oil embargo to free U.S. consumers from dependence on foreign oil, these projects involve research on renewable energy sources, such as wind, solar, and nuclear power, and such non-renewable sources as fossil fuels. Appropriations approved by Congress for fiscal 1995 include, among others, $442 million for fossil energy R&D, $288 million for solar energy research, $37 million for geothermal research, $293 million for nuclear energy research, and $49 million for wind energy systems.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p><ul>
<li>Terminate all federal funding for energy supply research and development, including fossil fuel R&D.
<p>
<li>Privatize all government-owned laboratories engaged in this research.
<p></ul>
<b>Savings from the Heritage Proposal:</b>
<p>
Rationale:  In today's dollars, the federal government has spent over $70 billion on energy research programs since the Department of Energy was created in 1977 and has little or nothing to show for it. The United States imports 30 percent more petroleum now than before the oil shock of 1973, and alternative energy supply methods account for only one percent of all energy produced in this country.<sup>27</sup><p>Much of this DOE-funded research is already conducted by private firms or simply irrelevant to market needs. Electric utilities, for instance, voluntarily fund the $240 million-per-year Electric Power Research Institute at no government expense. Moreover, "the major new technologies for enhanced oil recovery... have come from private industry, not DOE," according to the Congressional Budget Office, and DOE's $9 billion investment in nuclear fission research has gone to waste because the private sector has no interest in building new nuclear power plants. Thus, Energy "has little in the way of commercial applications to show for its investment."<sup>28</sup>  All the federal government's attempts to outguess the energy market have produced are such expensive failures as the Synthetic Fuels Corporation and the Clinch River Breeder Reactor.<sup>29</sup>  Federal funding for renewable and non-renewable energy research and development should be halted immediately.<p>There are seven federal laboratories engaged in Energy Supply R&D research:  one multi-program laboratory (the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory) and six program-dedicated laboratories like the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. These facilities consume over $1 billion of total Energy Supply R&D funds. Congress should move to sell all seven to the private firms which currently operate them or transfer them to the universities with which they are affiliated. Private firms then can choose to continue funding for any research they decide is commercially relevant.
<p>
Both the Grams and Tiahrt bills include a review of these research and development activities by a laboratory closure commission. The Tiahrt plan is bolder because it establishes specific spending reductions for each of the next five fiscal years (a 25 percent reduction in fiscal 1997 and 50 percent reductions in each following year); Senator Grams proposes to leave any reductions to the discretion of the commission. The problem with allowing a commission to review DOE's research activities is that, while it helps remove political pressures from the process, it also fails to take into account the dismal record of these activities. DOE's energy supply research and development should be terminated, immediately and completely.
<p>
<b>Naval Petroleum Reserves</b>
<p>
Established in 1912, the federally owned Naval Petroleum Reserve (NPR) is comprised of two commercial oil fields at Elk Hills (near Bakersfield, California) and Teapot Dome (near Casper, Wyoming) and oil-shale reserves (near Rifle, Colorado).
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p><ul>
<li>Sell the Naval Petroleum Reserves to the highest bidder.
<p></ul>
<b>Savings from the Heritage Proposal:</b>
<p>
Rationale:  There is no longer any compelling national, strategic, or commercial reason for the federal government to own the Naval Petroleum Reserve. These oil fields were set aside by Presidents William Howard Taft and Woodrow Wilson to assure fuel for the Navy as it converted from coal to oil. By and large, they sat idle until the Arab oil embargo of 1973-1974, when Congress decided that NPR oil should be pumped and sold and the proceeds used to ready the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The Department of Energy owns 78 percent of the Elk Hills facility, and a private oil company (Chevron) owns the remaining 22 percent. Overall, the NPR is the equivalent of less than one percent of total U.S. domestic output -- hardly enough to be vital to national security interests.
<p>
Although the NPR generates more than $400 million per year in revenue to the government, studies have found that these fields are operated far less efficiently than comparable privately owned oil fields. The NPR was targeted for privatization by the Reagan Administration in a proposal endorsed by the President's Commission on Privatization in 1988. The Clinton Administration's fiscal 1996 budget also proposes selling the NPR, but Congress so far has failed to act. The Office of Management and Budget estimates that the government's interest could be sold for some $1.5 billion, netting roughly $321 million after deducting the more than $400 million in revenues the NPR produces each year.<sup>30</sup>  Congress should embrace this effort and remove any legislative obstacles to selling these assets as quickly as possible.<p>The Tiahrt bill would transfer responsibility for the Naval Petroleum Reserves to the Department of the Interior and mandate the sale of a significant portion of the reserves to the private sector. The Secretary of Interior would then conduct a study to determine the best course of action concerning the remaining reserves. The Grams proposal, on the other hand, calls for sale of the entire reserve. This approach is preferable because it would result in much larger savings and serve taxpayers better.
<p>
<b>Strategic Petroleum Reserve</b>
<p>
Created by the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975, the nearly 600 million barrel Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) is a government-owned stockpile of crude oil available for release in the event of market disruptions such as the Arab oil embargo of 1973-1974. The Department of Energy operates six underground salt dome storage sites on the Gulf Coast of Louisiana and Texas.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p><ul>
<li>Sell the Strategic Petroleum Reserve immediately.
<p></ul>
<b>Savings from the Heritage Proposal:</b>
<p>
Rationale:  The Strategic Petroleum Reserve has become an expensive and obsolete vestige of the regulated oil markets that existed before the Reagan Administration deregulated them in 1981. Over the past 20 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the United States has spent about $4 billion constructing the SPR storage facilities and another $17 billion to fill the reserves. Although Congress has not approved funds to expand the reserve beyond its current level of 592 million barrels, the annual cost of operating these facilities is some $200 million. 
<p>
Since deregulation, the oil market has become increasingly diversified and the futures market, which hedges against price fluctuations, has become highly sophisticated. As a result, interruptions in the world oil supply of the sort that occurred during the Persian Gulf crisis in 1990 and 1991 do not have the same impact on the economy they once did. Moreover, the CBO notes, while the market responded efficiently to the Gulf War interruption, "both the process of deciding to use the SPR and the mechanism for selling the oil may have actually contributed to market uncertainty at the time."<sup>31</sup>. <p>The CBO estimates the SPR's current market value at $10 billion, or about $17 per barrel. However, the sales value may be less because the SPR is suffering water leakage as well as heat and gas buildups, which may present difficulties in extracting the oil. But even a more reasonable purchase price of $7 to $10 per barrel would generate revenues of $4 billion to $6 billion. 
<p>
Both congressional plans to terminate DOE call for partial sale of the Strategic Petroleum Reserves, principally those held at Weeks Island, Louisiana. Representative Tiahrt proposes to transfer control over the other portions to the Interior Department, with the Secretary of Interior responsible for determining whether there is justification for selling further reserves. Senator Grams proposes to transfer responsibility for the SPR to the Department of Defense. The Secretary of Defense then would be responsible for determining what portion of the reserves should be maintained and what portion sold. Whoever is responsible, the goal should be to privatize the maximum amount of SPR possible. The final bill should set strict guidelines to ensure this.
<p>
<b>Uranium Enrichment Facilities</b>
<p>
For some 40 years, the U.S. government ran two uranium enrichment facilities, one at Portsmouth, Ohio, and the other at Paducah, Kentucky. In 1992, the Energy Policy Act transformed this federal program into a wholly owned government corporation (similar to Amtrak) called the United States Enrichment Corporation. The USEC currently produces and markets uranium enrichment services to more than 60 private utilities that own and operate commercial nuclear power plants in this country and abroad. The corporation generates revenues of approximately $1.5 billion annually and, after expenses, returns a "dividend" of roughly $30 million to the Treasury.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<ul><p>
<li>Sell the U.S. Enrichment Corporation to the private sector in FY 1996.
</ul>
<b>Savings from the Heritage Proposal:</b>
<p>
Rationale:  There is no reason for the U.S. government to operate a commercial business, especially one that returns only a small profit to the Treasury while maintaining effective market control over the industry. According to its own promotional material, the USEC serves "approximately 90 percent of the domestic market and about 40 percent of the world market."<sup>32</sup>  Its annual revenues of $1.5 billion would rank it 286th on the <i>Fortune</i> 500 list of industrial firms. <p>Congress should remove the many needless obstacles and impediments placed on the corporation by the 1992 Act so that it can be made more attractive to private buyers and investors and sold in FY 1996 for top dollar. A businesslike enrichment corporation could bring bids of at least $1 billion if freed from oppressive congressional restrictions. Ideally, the two facilities should be sold to different buyers to avoid creating a private monopoly.
<p>
The House already has passed legislation to privatize the U.S. Enrichment Corporation. Similar legislation is pending in the Senate.
<p>
<b>Energy Conservation Research and Grant Programs</b>
<p>
The Department of Energy spends nearly $800 million per year for energy conservation and research. This research is targeted toward improving energy efficiency in various sectors of the economy, such as transportation, industry, private and public buildings, and utilities.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p><ul>
<li>Terminate all DOE conservation research and grant programs.
</ul><p>
<b>Savings from the Heritage Proposal:</b>
<p>
Rationale:  This program funds research and grants that should be financed by the private sector and state or local governments. For FY 1995, for example, Congress approved over $430 million for research targeted toward private industry. This funding includes some $20 million for building systems, $2 million for heating and cooling technology, over $25 million for industrial co-generation, $22 million for materials and metals processing, over $50 million for alternative fuels utilization, $1.2 million for "engine optimization in alternative fuels utilization," $1 million for vehicle systems materials, $1.5 million for light duty engine development, and some $3 million for international market development.
<p>
Congress also earmarked $226 million for state-based weatherization programs, $22 million for state conservation programs, and an additional $29 million for the "institutional conservation program."33  However important these conservation measures may be, they are not properly a function of the federal government. Congress should get out of the business of funding and micromanaging purely private research and purely local responsibilities. <p>Energy Information, Policy, Regulation, and Departmental Administration<br>Some $400 million of the Department of Energy's $18 billion-per-year budget is dedicated to departmental administration, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Energy Information Administration, and the Office of Economic Regulation.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p><ul>
<li>Make the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission an independent agency similar to the Federal Communications Commission or the Securities and Exchange Commission.
<p>
<li>Close down or privatize the Energy Information Administration.
<p>
<li>Eliminate all funding for non-defense departmental administration while closing down the Department of Energy. 
</ul><p>
<b>Savings from the Heritage Proposal:</b>
<p>
Rationale:  In testimony before a congressional subcommittee earlier this year, the General Accounting Office warned that "DOE suffers from significant management problems, ranging from poor environmental management of the nuclear weapons complex to major internal inefficiencies rooted in poor oversight of contractors, inadequate information systems, and work force weaknesses."<sup>34</sup>  Although the department has reorganized many times over the years to correct these deficiencies, those efforts have failed. The only recourse for Congress is to close the agency.
<p>
To dismantle the Department of Energy, Congress will have to complete various housekeeping duties such as eliminating over $400 million per year in departmental overhead funding and spinning off entities which can stand alone. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), which is charged with regulating certain interstate aspects of the natural gas, oil pipeline, hydropower, and electric industries, easily could be made an independent agency like the Federal Communications Commission. FERC is basically self-financed by the fees paid by regulated industries. Congress should begin a serious debate, however, over the extent to which the federal government should continue to regulate the private energy sector.
<p>
The Energy Information Administration (EIA) is a quasi-independent agency within the Department of Energy intended to collect and disseminate data on petroleum, natural gas, coal, nuclear power, electricity, alternate fuel sources, and energy consumption. All of the activities and functions performed by the EIA are carried out by private firms, newsletters, trade magazines, and industry associations. The EIA should be privatized and all federal funding eliminated.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
The proposals by Senator Grams and Representative Tiahrt would close down DOE, not just re-invent or re-organize it. This is important because it would prevent future Congresses from simply re-inflating the department's funding. In contrast, Secretary O'Leary's re-invention plan maintains DOE's inefficient bureaucracy and perpetuates some of the department's most unnecessary functions. And, although O'Leary's plan would "save" a reported $14.1 billion over five years, a significant portion of these savings are from asset sales. Once these sales are complete, the Department of Energy -- re-invented or not -- will continue to exist at little or no savings to taxpayers. The two congressional termination plans, on the other hand, ensure large savings well beyond the next five years.
<p>
Cabinet-level status should be reserved only for departments that provide core national activities of the federal government. The Department of Energy does not fit this description. There is no role for DOE in energy supply or regulation with the fall of OPEC and a stable international flow of oil. There is no need for massive nuclear weapons production with the end of the Cold War. All that remains of the Department of Energy's core missions are environmental remediation and research and development. The first could be managed more efficiently by the Department of Defense. The second should be the responsibility of private-sector energy providers. Thus, while DOE still performs a few functions that are likely to continue as federal responsibilities, these functions in no way justify continuing the U.S. Department of Energy as an independent department with Cabinet-level status.

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
The Department of Labor (DoL) has become one of the most pervasive regulatory agencies in the federal government. Created in 1913, DoL is currently responsible for the administration and enforcement of over 180 federal statutes. This proliferating body of legislation and regulation covers a wide range of workplace activities for nearly 10 million employers and well over 100 million workers, presenting a barrier to the formation of firms and their ability to create jobs.1<p>The 104th Congress has a rare opportunity to initiate fundamental reforms in the administration and enforcement of America's labor laws. If implemented, such reforms could save America's taxpayers $10.5 billion from 1996 to the year 2000 alone. The primary objectives of this effort should be to: 
<p><ul>
<li> Reduce excessive burdens on businesses and job creation while maintaining workplace health and safety; 
<p>
<li> Improve labor market flexibility while maintaining basic employment protections. 
</ul><p>
The best way to achieve these objectives is by closing this Cabinet-level department and moving certain of its key national functions into sub-Cabinet agencies or other departments. Other functions that are not national in scope should be devolved to the states, or in some cases to the private sector. Obsolete, ineffective, and wasteful rules and programs should be repealed or closed down.
<p>
The Department of Labor's programs are organized into seven main functional areas: <p>
1) Unemployment Insurance (UI) and Employment Services (ES),
<p>
2) Job Training Programs,
<p>
3) Workplace Health and Safety,
<p>
4) Private Pension Protection,
<p>
5) Employment Standards,
<p>
6) Economic Statistics, and
<p>
7) Labor Union Oversight. 
<p>
UI and ES form the largest functional area, accounting for around 75 percent of DoL's budget (set at $25.5 billion for FY 1995). The next largest budget function, Job Training Programs, accounts for around 20 percent. 
<p>
Examining these seven areas reveals that the administration and enforcement of American labor laws can and should be reformed, both to achieve the department's underlying objectives of workforce protection, including workplace health and safety, and to reduce the job-killing cost and complexity of today's labor regulations. To do this, Congress should take the following steps:
<p><ul>
<li> <b>Devolve financing and funding for the Unemployment Insurance and Employment Services to the states.</b> This would enable states to decrease the duration of unemployment, reduce payroll taxes, and increase jobs. Devolution should include the Veterans Employment Service, labor market information projects, the one-stop career system concept, and the administration of unemployment insurance. Congress also should repeal the Federal Extended Benefit program and provide incentives for states to overhaul and integrate their employment services with a view to reducing the duration of unemployment payments by moving the unemployed into new jobs more quickly. States also should have the option to begin exploring privatized unemployment insurance. Any remaining federal administrative functions should be transferred to the Treasury Department. 
<p>
<li><b> Consolidate all job training programs for the economically disadvantaged into a state block grant.</b> Congress should combine these programs, including the Job Corps, Senior Community Service Employment Program, Migrant and Seasonal Farm Workers Training, Indian and Native American Employment and Training, and Youth Fair Chance, into a block grant attached to the new welfare block grant recently passed by Congress. This would eliminate a maze of categorical programs and provide states the flexibility they need to develop programs that effectively reduce welfare dependency. States should be required only to focus these resources on means-tested job placement assistance and conduct control group evaluations of their effectiveness. Federal target and categorical requirements should be removed. The minimal federal oversight functions for this block grant should be transferred to the Department of Health and Human Services.
<p>
<li><b> Consolidate all other job training programs into a state workforce development block grant.</b> This new block grant for job placement assistance and training would include such things as dislocated worker programs, School-to-Work programs, and Adult Technology Learning programs. Even the Department of Labor recognizes that a block grant would eliminate conflicting rules and administrative structures, remove bureaucracy at every level, and end the wasting of tax dollars.2  The determination of target groups should be left to the discretion of the states. Because the effectiveness of today's training programs is questionable,3 total funding for this block grant should be cut by 50 percent and frozen until scientific studies can prove they are effective. In carrying out these studies, states should be required to have at least one ongoing control group evaluation on programs funded from the block grant. The minimal federal oversight functions for this block grant should be transferred to the Department of Health and Human Services.
<p>
<li><b> Reform the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and combine it with the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA).</b> This reform is needed to "refocus the [federal] responsibility for ensuring worksite safety and health on the workplace."4  Merging MSHA with a reformed OSHA is a sensible first step toward improving workplace health and safety, limiting unnecessary government intervention, and reducing inefficient, wasteful government spending.5  Businesses already have much stronger financial incentives than OSHA penalties, such as the costs of lost productivity, workers' compensation, and liability claims,6 to maintain and continually improve workplace safety. Thus, the role of the federal government should be redefined from that of heavy-handed regulator to one of cooperative partner. Congress also should spin off the "new" OSHA as a separate sub-Cabinet agency, similar to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. An independent governing and standards-setting board should be established. National workplace health and safety standards are too important to be determined by a department subject to political influence.  
<p>
<li><b> Transfer the Pension and Welfare Benefit Administration to the Social Security Administration.</b> Responsibility for the oversight of public and private retirement programs currently is spread across three departments.7  Combining the agencies responsible for this oversight would lead to more efficient research and retirement policy coordination. In addition, Congress should spin off the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation as an independent sub-Cabinet agency, fund the PBGC separately, and begin exploring ways to privatize pension insurance.8 <p><li><b>Repeal and nullify outdated labor laws, executive orders, and regulations.</b> Congress should streamline labor regulation by eliminating the heavy burden of outdated or restrictive rules. This means, for example, nullifying Executive Order 11246 and related affirmative action regulations affecting federal contractors and subcontractors; eliminating the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP); repealing the Davis-Bacon Act and Service Contract Act, as well as Section 13(c) of the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964; reforming the Fair Labor Standards Act; and strengthening the Portal to Portal Act of 1947. Congress then should transfer all remaining functions of the Wage and Hour Division to the Justice Department.
<p>
<li><b> Combine the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Census Bureau within a newly created sub-Cabinet agency, the Bureau of National Statistics.</b> A new Bureau of National Statistics (BNS) would make it possible to develop and carry out a comprehensive, systematic effort to combine surveys and develop economies of scale. It also would be in a better position to undertake the careful evaluation and research needed to make decisions about more efficient survey design and ways to eliminate duplication and reduce paperwork and data collection burdens. Statistical functions of other departments also should be housed within the new bureau to ensure that the government's data collection efforts are insulated from politics.
<p>
<li><b> Close down the Office of the American Workplace and nullify Executive Order 12954 (Striker Replacement).</b> Government promotion of high-performance workplaces actually serves only as corporate welfare and a training subsidy for unions. These activities already are conducted in the private sector through business associations and unions. Congress should transfer labor union oversight and investigative functions, including those in the Office of the Inspector General, to the Justice Department. 
</ul><p>
The 104th Congress has held a number of hearings and introduced a variety of bills to reform and update America's labor laws, and it continues to reassess dozens of labor policy issues that have been neglected for years.9  This year's budget process also has provided Congress with a vehicle for reform. Aside from reforming and consolidating job training programs, the Administration's proposed budget did little to "reinvent" DoL. President Clinton proposed to raise the department's budget authority by over 14 percent and its full-time staff by 304.10  Congress appropriately rejected the President's budget and is proceeding with its own plan to reform the administration of federal labor policy through the budget process. <p>The House recently voted to reduce FY 1996 DoL discretionary spending by 13.8 percent. It also instituted several important reforms. For example, the House budget prohibits funding for implementation of President Clinton's executive order concerning the permanent replacement of striking workers by federal contractors, prohibits the issuance of two unnecessarily burdensome OSHA regulations on ergonomics and fall protection, and bars DoL from promoting "economically targeted investments" (ETIs) by private pension plans. The House also is planning to repeal the Davis-Bacon and Service Contract Acts as part of the budget reconciliation process.
<p>
The Senate Appropriations Committee recently voted to reduce DoL discretionary spending for FY 1996 by 12.6 percent. Although the Senate's DoL budget prohibits implementation of the striker replacement executive order, it does not contain the House's OSHA regulatory provisions or the prohibition on promoting ETIs. Differences between the House and Senate versions will have to be worked out in conference committee.
<p>
As the following study demonstrates, the U.S. Department of Labor has gone far beyond its original mandate to become a burdensome and feared regulatory agency that presents significant barriers to creating jobs and increasing real wages. The proliferation of mandated benefits and workplace requirements makes most small businesses think very carefully before hiring additional workers. Overzealous enforcement has made DoL the enemy of American business. Congress should do what the Clinton Administration promised but failed to do -- reform this overgrown and intrusive bureaucracy. 
<p>

<b>HOW THE DEPARTMENT HAS GROWN</b>
<p>
The Department of Labor was created by Congress in 1913 in response to pressure from organized labor. Its goals, according to the statute, were to "foster, promote and develop the welfare of wage-earners, to improve their working conditions, and to advance their opportunities for profitable employment."  Initially, DoL consisted of four bureaus transferred from the old Department of Commerce and Labor:  the Bureau of Labor Statistics (formerly the Bureau of Labor), the Bureau of Immigration, the Bureau of Naturalization, and the Children's Bureau. These bureaus reflected the department's original focus:  collecting information and publishing reports on employment, wages, and working conditions; reviewing the effects of immigration on the job market; and monitoring the use of child labor.
<p>
In 1918, during World War I, Congress established the War Labor Administration (WLA) to insure adequate industrial production and foster labor peace in defense production industries. The WLA set policies on wages, hours, and working conditions. It recruited women and minorities to work in defense industries. It also sought to encourage better workplace race relations, promote worker safety and health, and address other employment-related problems that might hinder war production. Although Congress moved quickly after the Armistice to end its activities, the WLA's initiatives embodied ideas of the Progressive movement that later would spawn the New Deal, Fair Deal, New Frontier, and War on Poverty. 
<p>
What began as primarily an advocacy, educational, and administrative department over time became a regulatory and enforcement agency. Since 1918 Congress has expanded DoL's regulatory functions considerably, often because of political pressure from social reform movements or organized labor. For instance: 
<p><blockquote>
	During the 1920s, in response to the women's suffrage movement, the Women's Bureau was added to promote the status of and job opportunities for women. DoL also implemented the Immigration Acts of 1921 and 1924 that ended U.S. free immigration policy by imposing a quota system. 
<p>
	Confronted with the depression of the 1930s, Congress passed several laws to protect workers from economic change. The Davis-Bacon Act was enacted explicitly to protect white unionized workers on federal construction sites from competition by low-skilled nonunion workers, chiefly blacks and Hispanics. The Wagner-Peyser Act established the U.S. Employment Service, and the Social Security Act established the Unemployment Insurance system. The Fair Labor Standards Act mandated a minimum wage, overtime requirements, and child labor restrictions.
<p>
	In the late 1940s, DoL underwent many organizational changes. Its immigration responsibilities were transferred to the Department of Justice to consolidate federal immigration functions in the Immigration and Naturalization Service. In the postwar years, the failure of DoL to mediate a wave of strikes prompted Congress to transfer the department's labor conciliation functions to the independent Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, and veterans' reemployment rights became DoL's responsibility as the Defense Department was scaled back. In 1959, concern over the influence of organized crime and other union abuses led Congress to pass the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act to oversee the financial integrity and internal democracy of American labor unions.
<p>
	In the early 1960s, unfounded concern about the impact of technology on the labor force, combined with the War on Poverty, resulted in passage of the Manpower Development and Training Act of 1962. Ten years later, spending on federal job training programs was increased significantly by the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) of 1973. The Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) of 1982 reduced the enormous cost of CETA but did not improve the effectiveness of federal job training programs. 
<p>
	Since the 1960s, pressure from the civil rights movement has led to a variety of equal employment opportunity laws and redundant presidential executive orders to protect certain groups of individuals -- women, minorities, the disabled, the elderly -- such as the Equal Pay Act of 1963, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, and Executive Order 11246 as amended.11<p>	In the 1970s, DoL's regulatory and enforcement role expanded dramatically with passage of the landmark Occupational Health and Safety Act and again when responsibility for mine safety and health was transferred from the Department of the Interior. 
<p>
	Concern over the negative impact of federal trade policies on workers prompted Congress to pass the Trade Adjustment Assistance Act in 1974. The Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act was enacted in 1988 to provide advance notice of plant closings and mass layoffs to workers and their communities. 
<p>
	During the 1980s and 1990s, Congress has enacted various employee benefits and protections, such as the Employee Polygraph Protection Act of 1988 and the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993. 
</blockquote><p>
Since 1960, the expansion of federally mandated benefits and worker protections has begun to take its toll on business formation and job creation.12  In 1994, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, legally required benefits accounted for 32 percent of all benefits paid to workers on an hourly basis.13  Studies also show that changes in legally mandated benefits are shifted largely to workers in the form of lower real wages.14  Further, the increase in mandated benefits does not include the cost to businesses of complying with workplace safety and health regulations.15  Although well intentioned, these requirements add to the cost of hiring and managing workers and directly affect an employer's decisions about whether and when to hire a worker, which worker to hire, and how long to retain that worker. The rise in nonwage labor costs is important because it is one of the forces leading employers to lay off workers, as well as to utilize part-time, temporary, and contract labor.16<p>Ironically, organized labor has been so successful in persuading Congress to legislate matters that once were the province of collective bargaining that they have nearly driven themselves out of business. And with each Congress, Washington has placed more and more requirements and restrictions on employers and the labor market.17  This growing regulatory burden has made DoL inspectors as feared as IRS auditors and most small businesses very cautious about hiring additional workers.<p><b>RECOMMENDATIONS</b><p>Today's labor market conditions and labor-management relations have changed since most of America's major labor laws were passed. Workers are demanding more flexible hours, working conditions, and compensation packages than current laws and regulations allow. It is time for Congress to reform the administration and enforcement of America's labor laws. Only a fundamental rethinking of DoL and its functions can lead to the formulation of a proper and truly effective federal labor policy. The primary objectives of this reform should be to reduce excessive burdens on businesses and job creation while maintaining workplace health and safety and to improve labor market flexibility while maintaining basic employment protections. 
<p>
The best way to achieve these objectives is by eliminating the DoL as a Cabinet department. Certain key national functions should be carried out by sub-Cabinet agencies or transferred to other departments. Other functions that are not national in scope should be devolved to the states, or in some cases to the private sector. Obsolete, ineffective, and wasteful rules and programs should be repealed or closed down.
<p>
<b>I. REFORM UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE AND THE EMPLOYMENT SERVICE.</b><p>
Over two-thirds of DoL's budget is consumed by the Unemployment Compensation (UC) Program.18  This program has two main objectives:  to provide temporary and partial wage replacement to recently unemployed workers, and help stabilize the economy during recessions. The UC program is financed by a Federal Unemployment Tax (FUTA) of 0.8 percent19 of the first $7,000 in wages and state unemployment insurance taxes that average 0.9 percent of total wages. The revenue raised by FUTA is used to administer Unemployment Insurance (UI) and maintain a system of Employment Service (ES) offices. Portions of FUTA revenues also fund the federal half of the Extended Benefits Program and federal loans to depleted state accounts. State UI tax revenues fund state UI benefit payments and the state half of the Extended Benefits Program. At the end of fiscal 1995, state accounts in the UI Trust Fund had a balance of $35.6 billion. Like the Social Security Trust Fund, any positive balance in the UI Trust Fund is used to fund other federal programs. General revenues are used to fund federal unemployment benefit programs and allowances such as Trade Adjustment Assistance and NAFTA Transitional Adjustment Assistance. 
<p>
When the UC program was enacted in 1935, Congress intended that it be a federal-state partnership. The federal government was to set broad parameters, provide adequate and equitable funding for state administration, and oversee state law and operations to ensure compliance and conformity. The states were to be responsible for carrying out the program while complying with all federal laws and regulations, as well as their own state requirements. However, the federal government has used the state conformity process to convert the basic program philosophy into a more acceptable ideology and frequently upsets the balance of administrative funding and workloads by dictating that states absorb the costs of administering additional programs.20<p>Over the past decade, federal budget constraints have had a detrimental effect on services provided to unemployed workers by the state UI system and ES offices. Even though FUTA revenues collected for UI and ES administration have been more than sufficient, Congress continues to extend the 0.2 percent FUTA surtax on jobs and limit UI and ES administration appropriations.21  This masks the true size of the federal deficit. The federal government actually uses the UI system to fund programs that lead to longer periods of unemployment for workers22 and unnecessarily high payroll taxes. This is contrary to the primary purpose of the UI system23and reduces real wages.24<p>The UC program should be reformed to limit the federal role, as Congress originally intended, and to restore responsibility and accountability to the states. Studies show that states can decrease the duration of unemployment and thereby reduce payroll taxes and increase jobs.25 <p>What Congress Should Do:<p><b>Devolve financing and funding for the UI system and Employment Service to the states. </b><p>Congress should repeal the temporary 0.2 percent FUTA surtax and increase the FUTA offset26 from the current 90 percent to 100 percent if a state conforms with federal law. States should be allowed to collect one UI tax for administration and benefits. Each state would be responsible, and accountable, to employers for UI payroll tax dollars and for the administration and effectiveness of the UI/ES system. Receipts from the single state UI tax should be deposited into each state's UI account, maintained by the Department of the Treasury. States also should have the option to begin exploring privatized unemployment insurance.
<p>
<b>Repeal the Wagner-Peyser Act and amend FUTA to require states to establish public employment offices in labor market areas designated by state legislatures. </b>
<p>
Each state should have the flexibility to deliver job placement assistance in ways that meet the needs of its employers and job seekers. However, states should be required to ensure reasonable access to services for workers and to register for work all eligible claimants who are not temporarily laid off. Reform must provide incentives for states to explore ways to integrate employment services and reduce the duration of unemployment payments by moving the unemployed into new jobs more quickly. These incentives should include opening up the job placement assistance offered through the state ES offices to private competition and other UI experiments.
<p>
<b>Eliminate the federal extended benefit program and the federal extended unemployment compensation account (EUCA). </b>
<p>
Funds in the EUCA should be transferred to state UI accounts based upon each state's relative share of covered employment. The 1992 amendments that made it easier for states to trigger extended benefits (EB)27 should be repealed. The 1992 change made it easier for states to qualify for extended benefits and encouraged individuals to stay on unemployment benefits even when jobs were available. By basing the trigger for extended benefits on a state's total unemployment rate rather than its insured unemployment rate, Congress also broadened considerably the number of those who can qualify for extended benefits. Those who argued for this change claimed that basing benefits on the insured rate meant that many of the unemployed were not receiving benefits and that the program therefore was not working as intended. But, as pointed out at the time by Labor Department officials, this gap between the number of people who were unemployed and the number collecting benefits is normal and is an intended purpose of the program.28<p><b>Eliminate the Federal Unemployment Account (FUA), which is used to loan money to insolvent state UI accounts. </b>
<p>
 Funds in the FUA come from a portion of the FUTA payroll tax on jobs.29  The federal government uses the FUA to provide loans to states that have depleted their UI accounts during severe recessions. When the FUA is not being used for state loans, the surplus that builds up is used to fund other government programs and amounts to a tax on jobs to reduce the deficit. At the end of September 1995, there will be a $7.4 billion surplus in the FUA. The FUA should be eliminated and its funds transferred to state UI accounts. States that deplete their UI accounts should be able to borrow directly from the U.S. Treasury rather than from a surplus account maintained to offset the federal deficit.
<p>
<b>Repeal the Disabled Veterans Outreach Program and the Local Veteran Employment Representative Program and amend FUTA to incorporate the veteran preferences already in Title 38 of the U.S. Code (Veterans Benefits). </b>
<p>
The administrative efficiency of ES offices could be improved significantly by repealing barriers to the integration of veterans' services with other employment services. As the Vice President's National Performance Review noted in calling for the removal of barriers,30 DoL's Veterans' Employment and Training Service provides for state-employed, federally funded employment specialists to serve veterans in local state employment service offices. However, staff are legally prohibited from helping non-veterans. "So, if a local office is crowded with non-veterans," points out the NPR, "these specialists cannot help out -- even if they have no veterans to serve."  Employment Service staff would be used more efficiently and the public better served by eliminating this requirement.
<p>
<b>Eliminate Trade Adjustment Assistance. </b>
<p>
This program funds payments for unemployment benefits, allowances, and training costs to workers affected by foreign trade imports under the Trade Adjustment Assistance Act (TAA). In addition, the TAA provides for payment of similar benefits to workers adversely affected by NAFTA. As well intentioned as this may be, workers who can prove they lost their jobs because of foreign competition or NAFTA should not receive government benefits that exceed the assistance available to those laid off due to domestic competition.31  In any case, the department's own auditors have concluded that the TAA has not worked as intended, and the new NAFTA-TAA program likely will meet the same outcome:  Instead of providing retraining help, the TAA program has turned into a compensation program.32  Funding for these ineffective programs should be eliminated.<p><b>Permit state legislators to determine ES administrative budgets, payroll taxes, and UI benefits under limited federal guidelines. </b><p> The UI system is an experience-rated and employer-paid payroll tax. It was set up with specific objectives and a designated tax as its funding source. Federal proposals to combine the funding sources for the ES program and job training programs are unwise. Job placement services have different goals, populations, and outcomes from those of training programs. ES offices are supposed to get unemployment claimants back to work quickly, thereby ensuring that employer taxes are as low as possible. Job training programs often do not share that objective. Suggesting that FUTA payroll tax funds be used for anything other than paying unemployment benefits and funding state job placement assistance is merely a backdoor way to introduce a payroll tax for training. Devolving ES funding removes the potential for Congress to dilute the mission of the system and divert funding for other purposes.
The limited federal guidelines should include the following:
<p><ul>
<li>	The single state UI tax for both administration and benefits should be experience rated.
<p>
<li>	Funds should be used only for program administration and weekly benefits and should be capped at levels necessary for proper and efficient administration during periods of high unemployment.
<p>
<li>States should be required to continue cooperative and financial contracts to administer the interstate benefit program.
<p>
<li>	Federal funding for the administration and payment of federal employee UI benefits, military separations, and disaster unemployment programs should be deposited in state UI accounts as needed.
<p>
<li> Federal oversight should be limited to determining whether state laws conform with federal requirements.
</ul><p>
<b>II. CONSOLIDATE JOB TRAINING PROGRAMS INTO BLOCK GRANTS.</b><p>
The current maze of discretionary job training programs accounts for another substantial portion of DoL's budget. Many DoL programs overlap programs in other departments. The General Accounting Office has identified 163 employment training assistance programs across the federal government, spending about $20 billion per year.33  Moreover, "this fragmented system wastes resources and confuses and frustrates clients, employers, and administrators."  For FY 1995, thirty of these programs, totaling $5.8 billion, were funded through DoL.34  The Employment and Training Administration, the primary DoL agency responsible for job training programs, is run by 1,529 employees and accounts for 50 percent of DoL's discretionary budget.35<p>President Clinton, as part of his "Middle Class Bill of Rights" initiative, has proposed significant funding increases in his FY 1996 budget.36  For example, DoL proposed to increase funding for the School-to-Work program by 63 percent and funding for the One-Stop Career Center program by 100 percent. But the Clinton Administration also agrees that federal job training programs are fragmented, overlapping, and lack accountability. Part of the President's initiative is to consolidate and reform 70 job training programs. 
<P>
Because statistics indicate that more education leads to better paying jobs, Congress and others assume that job training programs work. Unfortunately they don't. Rather than focusing on who should have responsibility for job training programs, Congress must first ask itself a fundamental question:  Why should we continue to spend taxpayer money on programs that don't work?37 <p>Job training programs, although well intentioned, have not raised the long-term hourly earnings of participants. They do not achieve this primary goal because there is little, if anything, the government can do to alter what happens when individuals neglect their first 12 years of primary education.38  The billions of dollars spent on government job training and public assistance programs are too much too late. What is needed are more fundamental changes aimed at improving basic education through school choice, strengthening curricula, and completing high school. Reform that focuses on these goals will reduce the demand for government job training programs that do not work.
<p>
Bills have been introduced in both the House and the Senate to reform federal job training programs. The House recently passed the Consolidated and Reformed Education, Employment, and Rehabilitation Systems Act (H.R. 1617), introduced by Representative Howard McKeon (R-CA). The Senate also recently passed the Workforce Development Act of 1995 (S. 143), introduced by Senator Nancy Kassebaum (R-KS). Although both bills improve current law by consolidating some of the federal job training programs into state block grants and increasing accountability, major changes need to be made in conference.
<p>
What Congress Should Do:
<p>
<b>Consolidate more programs into the block grants.</b>
<p>
S. 143 consolidates only around 80 of the 163 federal employment and training programs and reduces spending by 15 percent. H.R. 1617 consolidates even fewer programs. H.R. 1617 does not include Job Corps, the most expensive federal job training program, or vocational rehabilitation programs. S. 143 marginally reforms Job Corps, but does not consolidate it in the state block grant. However, S. 143 does include vocational rehabilitation programs. 
<p>
 Congress can improve both bills by consolidating the Job Corps, vocational rehabilitation, and the Senior Community Service Employment program into the state block grant.
<p>
<b>Provide maximum flexibility to the states in designing their programs. </b><p>
Overly prescriptive federal requirements should be removed. State and local elected officials are in the best position to allocate block grant funds. There is tremendous diversity among and within the states. What Washington prescribes as the solution for problems in urban areas often does not fit well in places like Utah or Vermont. Prescriptive solutions and fixed allocations of funds will work in some places, but will also be the worst possible solution in many others.39  State and local workforce development boards should be optional, not mandatory. Continuing School-to-Work activities also should be optional and not mandatory.<p>Further, states should have the discretion to transfer funds between the welfare and job training block grants for the purpose of implementing work requirements and job placement assistance programs. This would provide additional flexibility to states and eliminate micromanagement by the federal government. 
<p>
<b>Strengthen accountability with control group evaluations.</b>
<p>
Each state should have at least one control group evaluation of its job training programs ongoing at any given time. Such scientific evaluation should be conducted by using experimental and control groups chosen by scientific random assignment and, at a minimum, should determine whether job training and job placement programs effectively raise the hourly wage rates of individuals receiving training through such programs. Each state should report annually on the status and results of its control group evaluations.
<p>
The addition of state control group evaluations would quickly build a body of evidence on the true effectiveness of job training programs. Few job training programs have ever been subject to rigorous evaluation.40  As a report from the Secretary of Labor points out, "there are many areas where little thorough and reliable evaluation evidence is available."41  The few solid studies that have been conducted generally fail to show any significant increase in the hourly earnings of participants directly related to job training. Historically, performance measures and benchmarks have been the more common but unsatisfactory means of determining whether or not these programs work. The findings from performance measure methods, particularly the negative ones, have been easily manipulated and explained way. Without a requirement for rigorous, control group studies, American taxpayers will never know whether they are funding effective programs or just throwing good money after bad. 
<p>
<b>Scale back the labor market information system.</b>
<p>
Initial labor market information system (LMIS) activities should be restricted to conducting a feasibility study, developing LMIS options, and estimating the cost of those options. The current LMIS provisions in both H.R. 1617 and S. 143 immediately plunge the federal and state governments down an untested and expensive path that may not be feasible. Further, mandating states to create a LMIS at the substate level for which no data current exist will be extremely expensive. The initial information for the labor market information system should be restricted to data readily available from the Census Bureau and other federal and state agencies.
<p>
Further, employers should not be mandated to provide any information. All employer provided information on job openings, application procedures, employment requirements, wages, benefits, and hiring patterns should be strictly voluntary. Any information supplied by either individuals or employers should also be immune from the legal process and should not, without the consent of the individual or employer, be used for any judicial or administrative proceeding. 
<p>
<b>III. REFORM AND RESTRUCTURE WORKPLACE HEALTH AND SAFETY.</b>42<p>Although Congress intended that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) assure all workers safe and healthy working conditions, the effectiveness of these agencies in carrying out their missions is questionable. From rulemaking to enforcement, the regulatory nightmare that businesses face has made OSHA inspectors as feared as IRS auditors.43  Although most employers maintain relatively safe and healthy workplaces, OSHA maintains an adversarial approach to setting and enforcing standards.44  Significant reform is required to redefine the federal government's role in workplace safety and health and "refocus the responsibility for ensuring worksite safety and health on the workplace."45  Vice President Gore's National Performance Review correctly recognized that an army of OSHA inspectors is neither necessary nor likely, given the federal budget situation. A new approach is required to increase workplace health and safety and balance the budget. Merging MSHA with a reformed OSHA is a sensible first step toward improving workplace health and safety, limiting unnecessary government intervention, and reducing inefficient, wasteful government spending. 
<p>
A number of bills have been introduced in the House and Senate to reform workplace health and safety programs. The leading bill in the House is H.R. 1834, the Safety and Health Improvement and Regulatory Reform Act of 1995, introduced by Representative Cass Ballenger (R-NC). In the Senate, Judd Gregg (R-NH) has introduced the Occupational Safety and Health Amendments of 1995 (S. 526), and Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) has introduced the Occupational Safety and Health Reform Act of 1995 (S. 592). Of these three bills, H.R. 1834 represents the most comprehensive OSHA reform. It also is the only bill that consolidates administrative overhead and ends duplicative costs by merging OSHA and MSHA.
<p>
Legislative changes are necessary to enable MSHA to allocate resources more efficiently and OSHA to work cooperatively with businesses -- for example, by making compliance assistance a permanent, central part of its program and mission. Efforts to reprioritize agency spending or administratively reinvent the agencies would change their bureaucratic culture only marginally and do little to consolidate administrative overhead and eliminate duplicative activities. President Clinton offered to reinvent OSHA after the 104th Congress announced its intention to create a more effective and efficient OSHA.46  In addition, President Clinton's proposed FY 1996 budget increased funding for OSHA compliance assistance by 23 percent while increasing overall OSHA and MSHA spending by 8.9 percent. The House recently voted to increase funding for OSHA compliance assistance by 19.2 percent while reducing overall OSHA and MSHA spending for FY 1996 by 12.5 percent. The Senate Appropriations Committee recently approved a 5.0 percent funding decrease for OSHA compliance assistance and a 3.1 percent overall reduction. However, Congress can accomplish much more by fundamentally redefining the role of the federal government so that it recognizes and more effectively uses the incentives businesses already have to improve workplace health and safety.
<p>
What Congress Should Do:
<p>
<b>Significantly reform OSHA.</b>
<p>
Although executive branch initiatives to reinvent workplace health and safety are welcome, statutory changes are required to redefine the federal government's role and ensure that congressional intent is implemented. Specifically,
<p><ul>
<li>Reform OSHA's regulatory process. <br>
Because OSHA's bureaucratic culture and lawyers have put the search for completely risk-free workplaces and ease of prosecution above common sense, it can take ten or more years to complete a rule.47  OSHA's regulatory process would be more timely and less burdensome if focused initially on hazards that pose the greatest risk to the most workers. Development of compliance directives should be made part of the rulemaking process and tied directly to economic analysis. Far too often, compliance directives are more burdensome than the rules themselves. OSHA also should be required to reassess the actual costs and benefits of its regulations after five years.
<p>
<li>Enhance and expand compliance assistance.<br>
Translating OSHA's confusing jumble of regulations into safer workplaces is difficult at best. Most employers want safe and healthy workplaces, but the Department of Labor is more concerned with prosecuting employers than with providing accurate, reliable compliance information. Explicitly redefining OSHA's mission towards compliance assistance will leverage employers' desire for safety and dramatically improve workplace safety and health. 
<p>
<li> Give first instance warnings for hazards that do not pose an imminent danger.<br>
OSHA continues its adversarial approach to standard setting and enforcement. Many employers are reluctant to call OSHA for assistance in making their workplaces safer for fear of triggering punitive inspections. First instance warnings will remove a major barrier to voluntary compliance.
<p>
<li>Require OSHA inspectors to have some expertise in the industry they are inspecting.<br>
OSHA inspectors are called upon to inspect a variety of workplaces, many of which, like mining, involve complex operations.48  Employers and employees deserve to have their workplaces inspected by qualified persons. 
<p></ul>
<b>Merge the Mine Safety and Health Administration with a reformed OSHA.</b>
<p>
Although OSHA and the MSHA were created separately, workplace injury and illness data no longer justify maintaining these agencies as separate entities with practically the same level of resources.49  Merging MSHA with a reformed OSHA and reallocating federal resources will accomplish two important objectives:  It will eliminate administrative overhead and duplicative costs and increase workplace health and safety in all industries.
<p><ul>
<li> Reforming the Mine Act to require only one inspection per year will enable MSHA to shift its inspection resources from mine operators with exemplary safety records to operators with poor safety records. By focusing on the "bad players," OSHA's new Mine Office will improve mine safety where it is needed most. Mine operators with good safety records will continue to have incentives to remain safe, in addition to fewer inspections and lower workers' compensation costs, and the new Mine Office will be able to use its resources more efficiently to focus on the "bad players."  Further, merging the two agencies will settle jurisdictional questions about enforcement and eliminate the memoranda of understanding that currently exist between OSHA and MSHA. Mine workers and taxpayers will get more mine safety for their hard-earned dollars.
<P>
<li> The Heritage Foundation estimates that consolidating MSHA and OSHA could save up to $510 million over five years.50  Merging MSHA and OSHA would eliminate the need to write two separate health regulations for the same workplace hazard, one for mining and one for everybody else. For example, there is no reason to have two separate Hazard Communication Standards, and noise protection for miners is no different from noise protection for other workers. Regional and administrative offices would be combined, and MSHA's Office of Information and Public Affairs could be eliminated.
<p></ul>
Merging MSHA with a reformed OSHA will not reduce workplace health and safety. No MSHA safety or health regulations would be abolished.51  Each underground mine will be inspected thoroughly at least once a year by qualified inspectors, and all workers will be able to request federal inspections if employers ignore their concerns about unsafe conditions. MSHA's imminent danger closure rule will be maintained, and mine workers finally will be covered by OSHA's health regulations. Focusing resources on compliance assistance will improve the ability of "good players" to translate OSHA and MSHA regulations into safer workplaces. Most important, by requiring only one mandatory inspection per year instead of four, a new OSHA/MSHA will be able to reallocate its resources to focus on improving the "bad players" instead of inspecting mines with good safety records.
<p>

<b>Establish the "new" OSHA as a separate sub-Cabinet agency that functions as a national safety and health standard-setting agency. </b>
<p>
Establishing health and safety compliance programs can be extremely costly and complicated. For employers operating in multiple states, where requirements vary from state to state, developing compliance programs can be almost impossible. There is no justification for different requirements in different states. The risk posed by certain hazards may vary from industry to industry and workplace to workplace, but not from state to state. Therefore, different states do not need different requirements. National workplace health and safety standards should be developed exclusively at the federal level.
<p>
National workplace health and safety standards are too important to be determined in a department that has been, and continues too be, subject to political influence. Independence and objectivity are crucial. The potential costs and benefits are too high for politics to play any role. The "new" OSHA should be a separate sub-Cabinet agency, similar to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. An independent governing and standards-setting board should be established. Its members would be appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate for staggered six-year terms. The board would be responsible for standards promulgation, oversight of a peer-review process, and issuance of compliance directives. It also would report its activities to Congress twice a year and be subject to congressional oversight hearings.
<p>
<b>IV. REFORM PRIVATE PENSION PROTECTION.</b>
<p>
The Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) was enacted in 1974 to protect the assets in employee pension plans that provide workers with retirement benefits promised by their employers. The Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration (PWBA) is the DoL agency that administers and enforces ERISA. ERISA protects the integrity of assets by requiring administrators of private pension and welfare plans52 to comply with strict fiduciary responsibility standards.53  It also requires administrators to provide participants with easily understood summaries of their plans, to file those summaries with PWBA, and to report annually on the financial operation of plans and the bonding of persons charged with handling funds and assets. Jurisdiction is shared by the PWBA, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC). Generally, PWBA has authority over Title I of ERISA,54 the IRS has authority over Title II,55and PBGC has authority over Title IV.56
<p>
PWBA is responsible for overseeing 720,000 pension plans and 4.5 million health and welfare plans in the private sector. ERISA-covered private pension plans cover over 88 million working Americans and their dependents and hold approximately $2 trillion in assets. Over 100 million workers are covered by employer-sponsored health and welfare plans. Three-quarters of PWBA's $65 million budget and 582 FTEs (full-time equivalent employees) is dedicated to enforcement focused on compliance with fiduciary responsibility provisions of ERISA. PWBA audits plans and conducts criminal and civil investigations. In 1993, the government carried out 6,033 investigations. 
<p>
President Clinton proposed to increase PWBA's budget by 17.1 percent. The House recently voted to reduce PWBA's FY 1996 spending by 7.5 percent and the Senate Appropriations Committee approved a 5.2 percent reduction. The House budget bill also prohibits the Department of Labor from promoting economically targeted investments with respect to private pension plans covered by ERISA. It specifically prohibits both the implementation of last year's PWBA Interpretive Bulletin and the funding of any Economically Targeted Investment Clearinghouse. The Senate Appropriations Committee deleted this House provision.
<p>
The primary focus of ERISA legislation this year is health insurance reform. In the House, Representative Harris Fawell (R-IL) has introduced the ERISA Targeted Health Insurance Reform Act of 1995 (H.R. 995), which would provide for health insurance portability, increased participation, improved plan solvency, and other consumer protections for workers. Senator Kassebaum has introduced the Health Insurance Reform Act of 1995 (S. 1028), the provisions of which are a subset of H.R. 995. S. 1028 was approved by the Senate Labor Committee.
<p>
A few bills reforming ERISA's pension provisions have been introduced in Congress. The most comprehensive bill, the Pension Simplification Act of 1995 (H.R. 2037 and S. 1006), has been introduced by Representative Rob Portman (R-OH) and Senator David Pryor (D-AR). These identical bills would create alternative methods for satisfying nondiscrimination provisions, repeal the family aggregation provision, repeal 5-year income averaging for lump-sum distributions, repeal the $5,000 exclusion of employees' death benefits, simplify the method for taxing annuity distributions under certain employer plans, and target access to pension plans for small employers.
<p>
The House has passed H.R. 1594, introduced by Representative John Saxton (R-NJ), to place restrictions on the promotion of economically targeted investments in connection with employee benefit plans by the Department of Labor and other federal agencies. A similar bill (S. 774) has been introduced by Senator Connie Mack (R-FL).
<p><blockquote>
	Responsibility for the oversight of public and private retirement programs currently is spread across the Departments of Labor, Treasury, and Health and Human Services. Transferring PWBA to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) would lead to more efficient research and retirement policy coordination. Combining PWBA with HHS also would be a good first step toward privatizing Social Security.57
</blockquote><P>
What Congress Should Do:
<p>
<b>Abolish the Economically Targeted Investment Clearinghouse.</b>
<p>
In 1994, DoL established the Economically Targeted Investment Clearinghouse (ETIC) to provide information on investment opportunities to pension plan managers. This program is DoL's way of encouraging pension plans to invest in areas of the economy that bureaucrats and politicians feel are underfinanced by private capital markets. It is misguided and jeopardizes the safety of pension plan assets.58  Tax dollars should not be used as another form of corporate welfare to market public investment choices to pension plan managers. If an investment, public or private, provides a good opportunity to pension plan managers, they will allocate plan funds accordingly. 
<p>
<b> Eliminate the Office of Inspector General's independent investigative authority.</b>
<p>
The experience and expertise for investigating fraud and abuse involving employee benefit plans reside in the PWBA. The existence of competing enforcement authorities within the DoL creates confusion and leads to duplication of effort. In recent years, PWBA has increased its efforts to bring criminal cases. As a result, PWBA investigators not only have expertise regarding how plans operate, but also know how to work criminal cases.
<p>
<b>Remove ESOPs from Title I (fiduciary standards) of ERISA.</b>
<p>
Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs) are hybrid benefit plans with two often competing goals. They are designed to increase employee ownership in companies and thereby improve productivity. They also are treated as retirement plans, with participants allowed to defer taxes on the value of their stock until it is withdrawn at retirement. Although ESOPs are governed by ERISA's fiduciary rules, several tax code sections give them special treatment not available to other retirement plans. Because the nature and financing of ESOPs are not always compatible with ERISA's rules, PWBA has struggled to accommodate ESOPs under the rules without damaging the fiduciary requirements that generally work well for other retirement plans. The result has been confusing and complicated rulings and legal standards. Congressional intent clearly has been to foster employee ownership. Trying to incorporate ESOPs into an Act designed to protect retirement income will only undermine this goal.
<p>
<b>Transfer the Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration to the Social Security Administration, spin off the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation as an independent sub-Cabinet agency, and begin exploring ways to privatize pension insurance. </b>
<p>
This would combine the agencies responsible for oversight of public and private retirement programs and result in more efficient research and retirement policy coordination. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) is a semi-independent, wholly owned government corporation modeled after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and guided by a board of directors. Congress should fund the PBGC separately and begin exploring ways to privatize pension insurance.59 
<p>

<b> V. ELIMINATE OBSOLETE WORKPLACE STANDARDS.</b>
<p>
The Employment Standards Administration (ESA) administers and directs programs under a variety of federal labor laws and executive orders. The Wage and Hour Division: <p><ul>
<li>Administers and enforces federal minimum wage, overtime, and child labor provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act; 
<p>
<li>Determines prevailing wage rates for federal contracts subject to the Davis-Bacon and Service Contract Acts;
<p>
<li>Registers farm labor contractors and enforces worker protections of the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act; and
<p>
<li> Enforces provisions and restrictions of the Employee Polygraph Protection Act. </ul>
<p>
The Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs administers and enforces Executive Order 11246, as amended, which requires federal contractors and subcontractors to take affirmative action in hiring. The Office of Workers' Compensation Programs administers the three basic federal workers' compensation laws:  the Federal Employees Compensation Act, Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, and Black Lung Benefits Act.
<p>
Today's economy is fundamentally different from when most of America's major labor laws were passed. Labor market conditions and labor-management relations have changed, but America's labor laws have not. Workers are demanding more flexible hours, working conditions, and compensation packages than current laws and regulations allow. The heavy burden of outdated and restrictive workplace rules reduces job opportunities and real wages. The proliferation of mandated benefits and requirements now makes most small businesses think very carefully before hiring additional workers and is one of the forces leading employers to utilize part-time, temporary, and contract labor. 
<p>
The House of Representatives recently voted to reduce ESA's FY 1996 spending by 12.2 percent.60  The Senate Appropriations Committee has approved a 9.9 percent reduction. Both bills prohibit funding for implementation of President Clinton's executive order concerning the permanent replacement of striking workers by federal contractors, and the House plans to repeal both the Davis-Bacon and Service Contract Acts as part of the budget reconciliation process.
<p>
A number of bills to reform America's labor laws also have been introduced in Congress.61  The House recently passed the Teamwork for Employees and Management Act (H.R. 743) to allow employers to create employee involvement committees. A similar bill (S. 295) has been introduced in the Senate by Nancy Kassebaum.
<p>
What Congress Should Do:
<p>
<b>Nullify Executive Order 11246, as amended, and all affirmative action provisions in federal law.</b>
<p>
Executive Order 11246, as amended,62 and its implementing regulations prohibit federal contractors from discriminating against employees or job applicants because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin and requires them to take affirmative action to ensure equal opportunity for protected groups. Contractors must develop a written plan covering each of their establishments that includes remedial steps to correct underutilization of available women and minorities.
<p>
Federal contractors and subcontractors already must comply with existing civil rights laws without the executive order. Laws requiring non-discrimination in employment are enforced through agencies at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Department of Justice. There are other, more equitable ways to expand employment opportunities for all Americans without requiring preferential hiring simply because individuals belong to certain groups. In addition, the regulations to implement Executive Order 11246 impose 20.4 million hours of paperwork (9,795 full-time, year-round workers) on federal contractors and subcontractors, the single largest DoL paperwork requirement.
<p>
A recent Supreme Court decision on affirmative action concluded that "the federal government can no longer make decisions based on the race of the individual except when there is a compelling governmental interest."63  Concurring, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote, "In my view, government can never have a 'compelling interest' in discriminating on the basis of race in order to 'make up' for past racial discrimination in the opposite direction."  Further, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote, "Government cannot make us equal; it can only recognize, respect, and protect us as equal before the law. That these programs may have been motivated, in part, by good intentions cannot provide refuge from the principle that under our Constitution, the government may not make distinctions on the basis of race."
<P>
<b>Repeal the Davis-Bacon and related Acts and the Service Contract Act.</b>
<p>
The Davis-Bacon Act was enacted during the Depression explicitly to prevent low-skilled nonunion workers -- chiefly blacks and Hispanics -- from competing for federally funded construction jobs.64  Unfortunately for these workers, it has succeeded. This year's budget process may be the only real opportunity to put an end to this Depression-era law that contributes to racial discrimination, needlessly costs taxpayers billions of dollars a year, stifles productivity, and subsidizes special interests. If only the facts were at issue, there would be no need for debate -- the Davis-Bacon Act would be repealed. However, repeal is threatened once again by intense pressure from special interests seeking to preserve their generous subsidies. Congress must withstand this pressure, act in the interests of all American workers, and repeal the Davis-Bacon Act. 
<p>
The Service Contract Act (SCA) artificially inflates the cost of federal service contracts by as much as $500 million per year and, like Davis-Bacon, creates an unfair barrier for many unskilled entry-level workers, who tend to be poor and minorities. DoL has long been criticized for the way it operates under this law. Despite two amendments,65 the SCA continues to suffer from statutory ambiguity, administrative problems, arbitrary requirements, and capricious enforcement.66  The General Accounting Office has recommended repealing the SCA because of DoL's "inability to administer the act efficiently and effectively" and because "it is impractical, in our opinion, to make 'prevailing wage' determinations under the act in a consistently equitable manner."67  Outdated by extensions of the Fair Labor Standards Act to service workers, the SCA has become an unnecessary and costly bureaucratic burden that should be repealed.
<p>
<b>Reform the Fair Labor Standards Act to allow employers to offer flexible schedule and compensation options.</b>
<p>
The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) was enacted to protect unskilled, low-pay workers. However, in today's economy where both parents likely are working, its rigid and inflexible provisions hurt more than help. The FLSA deprives workers of the right to order their daily lives on and off the job to meet the responsibilities of work and home. For example, under the FLSA a worker who wants to work 35 hours one week  in order to attend a child's parent-teacher conference, in exchange for working 45 hours the following week, either must forgo five hours of pay or have an employer willing to pay overtime the second week. Congress should extend to private workers the same freedom that federal employees have -- flextime -- and enable employers to offer flexible schedule and compensation options to their workers.68  
<p>
<b>Reform the National Labor Relations Act to remove restrictions on the ability for employers to create employee involvement structures.</b>
<p>
Employee involvement (EI) structures are a way to involve workers in business operations to improve productivity, safety, and customer service. Under current law, however, the only discussions of workplace issues that are clearly legal between employers and employees are those that occur in traditional collective bargaining arrangements. Employers can listen to their nonunion employees but cannot respond to their views without risking litigation and significant legal costs. Further, the Commission on the Future of Worker-Management Relations noted that the most legally vulnerable EI structures are "those that take a broader, more systemic approach to participation that the evidence suggests have the greatest long-term, positive effects on economic performance."69  Congress should reform the National Labor Relations Act to exempt EI structures formed to address issues of quality, productivity, safety, and customer service.  
<p>
<b>Transfer immigrant worker oversight and enforcement functions to the Immigration and Naturalization Service.</b>
<p>
In the late 1940s, DoL's immigration responsibilities were transferred to the Department of Justice to consolidate federal immigration functions in the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Since then, the federal government has shifted some of its immigration responsibilities to employers70 and added new DoL enforcement requirements.71  Responsibility for immigration policy once again is fragmented. Transferring DoL's immigration functions to the INS would combine the responsibility for federal immigration programs in one agency and facilitate more efficient immigration policy coordination.
<p>
<b>Transfer any remaining ESA programs to more appropriate departments or sub-Cabinet agencies.</b>
<p>
Legal enforcement of the Fair Labor Standards Act should be transferred to the Justice Department. Responsibility for federal workers' compensation laws and black lung benefits -- both primarily health-related income assistance programs -- should be transferred to the Department of Health and Human Services. Responsibility for all employment discrimination complaints should be consolidated in the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
<p>
<b>VI. GIVE GREATER INDEPENDENCE TO THE BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS.</b><p>
The American statistical system is one of the most decentralized data-producing systems in the world. Eleven specifically statistical federal agencies spend more that $1 billion annually. Further, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has found more than 70 individual agencies spending more than $500,000 a year for statistical activities and estimates that the federal government spent at almost $2.7 billion in FY 1994 for statistical operations.72
<p>
The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is the primary federal data-gathering agency in the broad field of labor economics and prices. It has no enforcement or regulatory functions and operates somewhat independently from DoL. The BLS collects, processes, analyzes, and disseminates data relating to employment, unemployment, and other characteristics of the labor market. It also publishes data on consumer and producer prices and workplace health and safety. Most of the data are collected by voluntary surveys conducted by the BLS and the Bureau of the Census, or on a cooperative basis with state agencies.
<p>
Change is needed. The current structure of the federal statistical system is inefficient and ineffective.73  The problems with the U.S. statistical system result directly or indirectly from fragmentation across the federal government. The system has neither the advantages that come from centralization nor the efficiency that comes from strong coordination of a decentralized system. As currently organized, it will be hard-pressed to meet the data demands of a technologically advanced and increasingly global economy.
<p>
The House recently voted to reduce BLS spending for fiscal year 1996 by 1.3 percent. The Senate Appropriations Committee recently approved a 6.1 percent reduction. Both bills double the amount appropriated for revising the consumer price index (CPI).
<p>


What Congress Should Do:
<p>
<b>Transfer the BLS into a new sub-Cabinet Bureau of National Statistics along with the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Economic Analysis.</b>
<p>
Consolidating the Census Bureau, the BLS, and the BEA in a centralized system is "the most effective solution to the problems of the federal statistical system."74  A new Bureau of National Statistics (BNS) would make it possible to develop and carry out a comprehensive, systematic effort to combine surveys and develop economies of scale. The BNS also would be in a better position to undertake the careful evaluation and research needed to make decisions about more efficient survey design and ways to eliminate duplication and reduce paperwork and data collection burdens. Incorporating the Bureau of Economic Analysis into the BNS is essential if the new bureau is to influence priorities for the broad array of statistical information required for the national income and product accounts. Reforming the system will assure a much better use of the tax dollars currently being spent on statistics.
<p>
Three major concerns need to be addressed. 
<p>
1) The BNS should be run by an independent Board of Directors, appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate for a fixed term similar to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.
<p>
2) To ensure that the public's response to voluntary surveys is not jeopardized, the BNS should be given complete legal confidentiality for all information collection activity. Data sharing arrangements with other agencies, for statistical purposes only, could be maintained under carefully controlled procedures approved and administered by the BNS Board.
<p>
3) Any administrative savings should stay within the agency to improve the quality and quantity of the nation's statistical information. Providing accurate information to the public and their state and local representatives is an important function of the federal government. 
<p>
<b> VII. ELIMINATE THE OFFICE OF THE AMERICAN WORKPLACE.</b><p>
The Office of the American Workplace (OAW), created in 1993 by Secretarial Order, is responsible for administering and directing discretionary workplace programs that encourage the development of "high performance" workplaces.75  OAW also is responsible for administering statutory programs to certify employee protections of various federally sponsored transportation programs, overseeing the financial integrity and internal democracy of American labor unions, and assisting unions in improving their organizational and administrative effectiveness. Labor Secretary Robert Reich recently has assigned OAW the task of implementing President Clinton's executive order prohibiting the permanent replacement of striking workers by federal contractors. 
<p>
OAW carries out these functions through two offices:  the Office of Workplace Programs (OWP) and the Office of Labor-Management Standards (OLMS). In FY 1995, of OAW's total budget authority of $31.4 million and 400 employees, $7.4 million went to OWP and $24.0 million to OLMS. For FY 1996, the President requested $41.8 million, or 33 percent more. Both the House and the Senate Appropriations Committees have voted to eliminate OWP and transfer OLMS to DoL's Employment Standards Administration. 
<p>
What Congress Should Do:
<p>
<b>Eliminate the Office of Workplace Programs. </b>
<P>
In addition to setting up a clearinghouse for information on high performance workplaces, OWP provides funds to unions to train labor leaders on what constitutes a high performance workplace. However well intentioned this may be, the federal government should not subsidize businesses and unions to teach them about the concept of "high performance" workplaces. This is more appropriately a function of business associations, chambers of commerce, and labor unions themselves. It is corporate and union welfare and should be eliminated.
<p>
<b>Eliminate the Office of Labor-Management Standards.</b>
<p>
Nor should American tax dollars subsidize unions to "assist" them in improving their organizational and administrative effectiveness. These functions should be eliminated, the number of full-time equivalent positions in OLMS should be reduced significantly, and OLMS field offices should be eliminated. The investigative and union oversight functions of the office should be transferred to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in the Department of Justice.76
<p>
<b>Repeal Section 13(c) of the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964. </b>
<p>
Section 13(c) of the Urban Mass Transportation Administration Act of 1964 gives public transit the most restrictive labor environment in America. To receive federal funds, local public transit agencies must pay employees up to six years of severance pay if their jobs are eliminated as a result of efficiency improvements. No other workers enjoy such special privilege. Should public transit agencies pursue service improvements that lead to fewer workers, their mandated 13(c) liability can surpass the federal funds they receive.77  Although many local governments are trying to improve their public transportation systems through competitive contracting and allowing private sector suppliers to operate, Section 13(c) discourages or blocks these efforts. 
<p>
Section 13(c) also adds to public transit costs and discourages efficiency by giving labor unions special privileges. Before a public transit agency can receive a federal grant, DoL must certify that special protective arrangements for local transit workers have been made. DoL generally interprets this to require negotiation of special labor agreements between the public transit agency and its union.
<p>
Public transit agencies want desperately to improve service and lower costs. At the same time, however, unnecessarily high labor costs make them unable to withstand a long period without federal funding. Section 13(c) has created this "Catch 22" for most public transit authorities and should be repealed. 
<p>
<b> VIII. STREAMLINE DEPARTMENTAL MANAGEMENT.</b><P>
The Departmental Management (DM) appropriation provides funding for a number of different programs that manage, set policy, and oversee its implementation at DoL. This includes the Office of the Secretary and Deputy Secretary, the Solicitor's office, the Bureau of International Labor Affairs, the Civil Rights office, and the Women's Bureau.
<P>
In FY 1995, DM's total budget authority was about $155 million and 2,548 employees. Over half the budget, $82 million, went to legal services and adjudication, and $26 million went to executive direction. For FY 1996, the President requested $173.1 million, or almost 12 percent more. The House recently voted to reduce DM spending for FY 1996 by 13.2 percent. The Senate Appropriations Committee recently approved a 7.6 percent reduction. The House substantially downsized the Bureau of International Labor Affairs, noting in its report that the bureau's activities are primarily discretionary and could be carried out by the Office of the Trade Representative or the State Department. 
<p>
What Congress Should Do:
<p>
<b>Eliminate the Bureau of International Labor Affairs (ILAB), the Women's Bureau, the Civil Rights office, and the National Occupational Information Coordinating Committee. </b>
<p>
The Bureau of International Labor Affairs, Women's Bureau, Civil Rights office, and National Occupational Information Coordinating Committee either duplicate existing federal functions or perform unneeded functions. 
<p>
The Bureau of International Labor Affairs coordinates the Department's international responsibilities, including relations with international organizations, estimating the impact of trade proposals, and ensuring compliance with worker rights provisions in U.S. trade law. These functions duplicate those carried out by the U.S. Trade Representative, the Department of the Treasury, and the Department of State.
<p>
The purpose of the Women's Bureau is to promote "the welfare of wage earning women and [seek] to improve their working conditions, to increase their efficiency and to advance their opportunities for profitable employment."78  The mission of the Department of Labor, including the Secretary, is to promote the employment opportunities of all Americans. There is no need for a separate bureau devoted to women, just as there are none devoted to other minorities, such as African Americans, Native Americans, or Asian Americans. 
<p>
The Civil Rights office ensures compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as well as other regulatory nondiscrimination provisions in programs receiving financial assistance from DoL, and promotes equal opportunity in these programs and activities. It also makes sure that all Department of Labor employees and applicants are treated equally. There should not be a separate appropriation for this activity within the department. All agencies within DoL should ensure that their programs are carried out in a nondiscriminatory manner. Individuals who believe they have been discriminated against by the department can file complaints under existing laws enforced by the Justice Department and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
<p>
Despite what federal officials may think, the National Occupational Information Coordinating Committee is not a necessary federal function. After funding for job training is consolidated into state block grants, the states should be given the option of setting up their own committees, in the event they decide that such committees would be useful, and funding them out of their block grants.

<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
Today's economy is fundamentally different from when most of America's labor laws were passed. Labor market conditions and labor-management relations have changed, but U.S. labor laws have not. Workers are demanding more flexible hours, working conditions, and compensation packages than current laws and regulations allow. Further, proliferating workplace legislation and DoL regulations to enforce them present a significant barrier to the creation of businesses and jobs, as well as to increases in real wages. It is time for Congress to reform the administration and enforcement of America's labor laws, and this means a fundamental rethinking of both the Department of Labor and federal labor policy. 
<p>
The primary objectives of this reform should be to reduce excessive burdens on businesses and job creation while maintaining workplace health and safety and to improve labor market flexibility while maintaining basic employment protections. The best way to achieve these objectives is by closing down the agency as a Cabinet-level department. If the recommendations in this study are implemented, $10.5 billion can be saved for the taxpayer from 1996 to 2000.
<p>
	Cabinet-level status should be reserved only for departments that provide core national activities of the federal government. The Department of Labor does not fit this description. Administering unemployment insurance, three-quarters of DoL's budget, is a state function and should be devolved to the states as a first step toward privatization. Ineffective federal job training programs should be consolidated into state block grants and rigorously studied. OSHA should be significantly reformed, combined with MSHA, and set up as an independent sub-Cabinet agency free from political influence. America's statistics would be improved by combining the BLS with the Bureau of the Census as another sub-Cabinet agency. Obsolete, ineffective, and wasteful rules and programs should be repealed or closed down. What remains of the Department of Labor, less than 2 percent of its budget, then could be transferred to more appropriate Cabinet-level agencies like HHS, Treasury, and Justice. There is no reason for these remaining functions to be conducted by an independent department with Cabinet-level status.

<li>    Among the issues being considered:  job training reform (H.R. 1617, S. 143); OSHA reform (HR. 1834, S. 592, and others); employee involvement committees (H.R. 743, S. 295); repealing Davis-Bacon (H.R. 500, S.141) and the Service Contract Act (H.R. 246); updating the Fair Labor Standards Act (H.R. 1226, S. 1129); reforming affirmative action (S. 497 and others); pension/ERISA reform (H.R. 995 and others); and immigration reform (H.R. 560, S. 269).<p>

<li>    A good example is the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. Instead of effectively enforcing U.S. immigration laws, Congress required employers to verify the citizenship and employment eligibility of all individuals hired.<p>
<li>    Most of this funding is related to the Unemployment Trust Funds and is considered mandatory.<p>
<li>    The current 0.8 percent FUTA tax rate has two components:  a permanent tax rate of 0.6 percent and a temporary surtax of 0.2 percent. The surtax was passed in 1976 to restore depleted state UI accounts and was supposed to expire in 1987. The surtax has been extended four times, primarily to fund extended benefit programs, since 1987 and now is supposed to expire in 1998.<p>

<li>    The balance in the Employment Security Administration Account will be $2.4 billion in September 1995. This is $1.01 billion more than the statutory limit. There is also a $7.4 billion balance in the Federal Unemployment Account that has been built up using surplus FUTA payroll taxes.<p>

This study concluded that extending the duration of UI benefits from six months to one year will increase the mean duration of unemployment by four to five weeks. Examples of federal programs that increase the duration of UI benefits are the Extended Benefits Program and Trade Adjustment Assistance.<p>
<li>    In today's economy, the primary purpose of the UI/ES system is to move workers whose jobs are permanently lost into new ones as quickly as possible.<p>
 <li>   Daniel S. Hamermesh, "New Estimates of the Incidence of Payroll Tax," <i>Southern Economic Journal</i>, Winter 1979. Research on the incidence of taxation generally has concluded that payroll taxes are borne predominantly, if not completely, by labor in the long run through lower real wages.<p>
<li>    Bruce D. Meyer, " Policy Lessons from the U.S. Unemployment Insurance Experiments," National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper No. 4197, October 1992. The willingness and ability of states to explore innovative ways to reduce UI duration is evident from the number of state UI experiments that have been wholly state funded. <p>
<li>   The actual gross FUTA tax rate is 6.2 percent. However, employers in states with federally approved UI programs (all 50 states) may credit 5.4 percent (90 percent FUTA offset) against the 6.2 percent tax rate, making the net FUTA tax rate 0.8 percent.<p>
 <li>   The 1992 amendment allowed states to trigger EB based on a certain percentage of total unemployment rate (TUR) instead of an adjusted insured unemployment rate (IUR). The IUR is computed by dividing the number of people claiming UI benefits by the number in jobs covered by UI. The TUR is the ratio of all unemployed workers to all workers in the labor force in that state. Eight states (Alaska, Connecticut, Kansas, Maine, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington) have approved the use of TUR triggers.<p>
<li>    Benefits generally are paid to workers with substantial labor force attachment who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own -- not to workers who quit their jobs voluntarily, who were fired for cause, or who have had no recent employment, such as those who are entering or reentering the labor force. Some of the difference between the insured unemployment rate and the total employment rate is due also to the exclusion of self-employed, certain agricultural labor and domestic service workers, railroad workers, and certain seasonal camp workers from collecting UI benefits.<p>
<li>    FUTA funds are deposited indirectly in the FUA when the EUCA and Employment Security Administration Account (ESAA) have reached their statutory limits. The ESAA is used to finance the administrative costs of the employment security program and should be phased out. Funds in the ESAA should be allocated to state UI accounts for the administration of state UI programs.<p>
<li>    <i>From Red Tape to Results</i>, p. 80.<p>
<li>   The TAA provides benefits to workers for 78 weeks, while the vast majority of other laid-off Americans, who qualify only for unemployment insurance, receive just 26 weeks of benefits.<p>
<li>    In its 1993 semiannual report to Congress, the Department of Labor Inspector General (OIG) discovered in a nine-state audit of the program that "After 19 years of operation, neither ETA nor the states know whether the TAA program is effective" in achieving its original goals of helping workers find suitable employment. The OIG found that only one in ten former participants "found new training-related employment that paid or had the potential to pay suitable wages."  Although the Act requires that participants enroll in approved training courses, " participants who did not wish to attend training were almost always granted waivers without losing entitlement allowance." <p>

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
	"Ideas have consequences." This simple truism became the battle cry of the Reagan Revolution of the 1980s. But it was true long before Ronald Reagan's term in the White House, and it is no less true today. America still needs the ability to explain its policies and to educate people around the globe about American values and the principles of freedom. Because so many in the world yearn to enjoy the freedom which the United States represents, the world still needs desperately to hear America's voice. 
<p>
	Reconvening this week after the August recess, Members of Congress should remember that although ideas have consequences, they will be impotent and inconsequential if they cannot be heard in the global marketplace of ideas. Congress will soon complete work on appropriations bills that provide funds for foreign operations and international broadcasting. In its zeal to cut wasteful and unnecessary government spending, the Republican majority is poised to cripple the Voice of America, even though VOA is both America's primary means of conveying ideas and information overseas and a cost-effective and strategically effective component of U.S. foreign policy. 
<p>
	 The congressional raid on U.S. government international broadcasting is an unfortunate convergence between Members who believe foreign affairs accounts are politically attractive targets for budget slashing and the Clinton Administration, whose lack of a coherent foreign policy means, among other deficiencies, inadequate support for international broadcasting. As a result, the 104th Congress is about to reduce the Voice of America's budget by as much as $54 million, a small amount in terms of the federal budget, yet a cut which will have disproportionate, far-reaching consequences. It could silence America's most effective voice in the global marketplace of ideas, even though VOA's benefits -- potential and actual -- far exceed the modest amount in the Administration's FY 1996 budget request ($395 million).
<p>
	Before embarking upon a budget-cutting course that is penny-wise but pound-foolish, Congress needs to take a closer look at the vital role VOA plays in foreign policy and public diplomacy. Instead of subjecting VOA to a false economy, Congress should provide enough funds to ensure that it remains the nation's international broadcasting flagship.
<p>

<b>IDEAS FUEL DEMOCRACY AND FREE-MARKET REFORM</b>
<p>
Social scientists never tire of explaining that today is the Age of Information. Television is ubiquitous. The transistor has made cheap portable radios common even in the world's poorest nations. Multi-spectrum radio broadcasting, proliferating cable, satellite, and direct broadcast television, microwaves, computers and fax modems, and other means of high-speed transmission have linked the world as never before. In the modern world, information dissemination and content have become indispensable instruments of state power. 
<p>
	 Information is no longer neutral; it has "strategic" value, as recent history demonstrates. In the victory of America and the West over Soviet Communism, military power kept the "Evil Empire" contained. But it was ideas and information, not bombs and bullets, that ultimately brought the Soviet edifice crumbling down. 	
<p>
	 However, if it is technologically the Age of Information, politically it is the Age of Chaos. The end of the superpower condominium has unleashed potent new forces kept contained by 45 years of Cold War. Today sub-national, tribal, ethnic, and religious conflict are battering peace and stability in the world as new nations and new ideologies struggle to be born. In this dangerous and uncertain world the interests of the United States will be challenged in ways Americans cannot now imagine. The ability to convey ideas and information will remain a necessary component of American foreign policy. America must be able to shape the course of the world through a voice that encourages the forces of freedom and discredits the forces of oppression.
<p>
	Perhaps it is self-evident, but in this era of dramatic global change it bears repeating that human behavior is determined by what one believes. There is a flow to history and culture; and its wellspring is the inner life of the mind -- thoughts, attitudes, and beliefs, and the passions they engender. This is especially true of the corporate actions of men and women, such as political decisions. The results of their thoughts flow through their hands or from their tongues and into the external world. Why else do dictators expend such immense efforts to control the content and flow of information?. What is usually the first objective of a <i>coup d'etat</i>? The answer is obvious -- radio and television stations. 
<p>
	 It is important to remember that the VOA did not begin as a weapon of the Cold War or in response to Soviet Communism. It was launched in 1942 at the beginning of World War II to counter Nazi propaganda, to reassure America's allies, and to give hope to people struggling against tyranny. Today the Voice of America is the nation's sole worldwide broadcasting service, reaching 100 million regular listeners over a network of shortwave, AM, and FM stations in English and 46 other languages. During the Persian Gulf War, VOA was America's only means of rebutting Saddam Hussein's propaganda aimed at the people of Iraq and was a key voice in reaching the nations of the Allied coalition.
<p>
	 VOA told the peoples of Nazi-occupied Europe during the darkest days of World War II:. "The news may be good or bad. We will tell you the truth.". Today VOA still follows this mandate, as required under its Charter (Public Laws 94-350 and 103-415), which obliges VOA to provide "a consistently reliable source of news and information" based on accuracy, balance, comprehensiveness, and objectivity.
<p>
	The accuracy and objectivity of America's radio voice are having a profound impact on nations emerging from 45 years behind the Iron Curtain. The Open Media Research Institute surveyed 400 leaders in government and politics, the military, religion, higher education, media, and private enterprise in the former Soviet Union, including the Baltic States, and in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Romania. According to this survey approximately 18 percent of the elites of these nations are regular listeners to VOA programming. In the Baltics, over 40 percent of decision-makers interviewed were regular listeners. Nearly three-quarters of the respondents felt strongly that Western radio broadcasts were still needed despite the new freedoms enjoyed by their own news media.1<p>	The importance of getting America's message to the elites of emerging nations simply cannot be overstated. President Lech Walesa of Poland and President Vaclav Havel of the Czech Republic have publicly confirmed the role which America's international broadcasting, including the VOA, has played in building democracy in their countries. In Ukraine, VOA's "Window on America" is said to be the most popular radio program in the country.
<p>

	VOA's example of free, uncensored news and objective, balanced features encourages the development of a free press among the listening nations, even when the Voice presents a less than flattering portrait of America. The example is strengthened by VOA's policy of maintaining a clear distinction between editorials, which speak in the name of the U.S. government, and news programming. 
<p>

	 The Cold War with the Soviet Empire may be over, but a cold war of a global nature -- the struggle over which ideas legitimize human governance -- is not over. The ideals of representative and limited government, of free enterprise and free institutions, have prevailed for the time being over Marxism-Leninism in much of the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, but by no means have they been accepted everywhere in the world. Most of the world's people still live under some sort of despotism or suffer from revolution and civil war.
<p>

	The VOA is America's force projection in this continuing global struggle between competing political principles and social values. The United States is under no obligation to convert the entire world to America's system of beliefs, but it is widely acknowledged that democratic nations are more peaceable and less likely to challenge U.S. interests than dictatorships. Both advocates of a foreign policy based on national self-interest and those who stress the moral component of foreign policy can support a vigorous, information-rich public diplomacy that makes the world friendlier and more compatible with American interests. As long as America can engage in this global cold war of ideas with information instead of military force, the struggle can remain "cold."
<p>

	Even the Kurds -- embattled on all sides and fighting among themselves -- believe the broadcast word is mightier than the sword in building an independent nation. Instead of using scarce resources to buy arms, Kurds are creating a London-based television service to beam Kurdish-language programming to Europe and the Middle East as a "better weapon to win a homeland" for their people.2 <p><b>INFORMATION AS A TOOL OF U.S. GLOBAL STRATEGY </b><p>Today's world contains rogue states and hostile nations whose main weapon is the well-disseminated lie -- lies about America's goals, interests, methods. To perpetuate themselves, these hostile regimes depend on propaganda, first to control their own populations and then to justify aggression abroad. It is an essential feature of modern dictatorships, one which they have in common despite differences in geography and culture, to consolidate power by controlling public opinion without having to answer to any traditional consensus or transcendent definition of right and wrong. 
<p>

	 Many Russians now freed from the yoke of Communism have remarked that the most hated feature of the Soviet regime was not the possibility of arrest and imprisonment in the Gulag, but the pervasive falsehoods that touched every aspect of life and tainted everything they touched. This kind of morally inverted society built on propaganda can be altered only through rebuttal by trustworthy, countervailing information over time. The only antidote to falsehood is truth, but truth is impotent unless America has the means to convey it into the domain of the lie.
<p>

	Today the threat of Soviet Communism has receded, only to be replaced by a new threat. By now it is universally acknowledged that revolutionary Islam represents one of the main challenges to democracy and American interests in the world -- not Islam <i>per se</i>, but the revolutionary movement which draws legitimacy from a militant and politicized interpretation of Islamic theology. 
<p>

	 The vast majority of the world's Muslims are not part of radical movements. Indeed, the governments of moderate and friendly Muslim countries are the primary targets of Islamic radicals. Today revolutionary Islamic regimes have ample money and access to the latest information technology. In this global contest for hearts and minds, VOA is the most potent means America has to combat the rising tide of a revolutionary ideology in which Mohammed has replaced Marx. 
<p>

	 Muslim revolutionaries realize the value of information as a tool of their strategy. Radio Tehran broadcasts daily in 23 languages, in English and European languages as well as languages native to the Middle East and the Muslim regions of the former Soviet Union. Significantly, Radio Tehran broadcasts in Serbo-Croatian to Bosnia, constantly reinforcing the theme throughout all of its coverage area that the United States is the faithless enemy of Islam and that America has imperialist designs on the Persian Gulf and the oil-rich Middle East. Though these charges are false, there are enough points of reference in the message to make it plausible to Tehran's audience and give the falsehood a political impact. 
<p>
	 VOA's daily presence through its Arabic and Farsi services is balancing the picture and countering Iran's daily radio diet of anti-Western propaganda. VOA's 100-kilowatt AM transmitter in Kuwait will be upgraded to begin transmitting next year at 600 kilowatts and will reach all of Iraq and most of Iran, where the Voice already has an 11 percent listenership. America's message to Iran also sustains hope among those who suffer persecution at the hands of the mullahs, like members of the Baha'i and Christian faiths. In this part of the world where America has had to fight to defend its vital interests, VOA gives an accurate picture of a free society which respects all religions and treats Islam respectfully, reporting, for example, that Islam is the fastest-growing religion in the United States. 
<p>

	In the Balkans, VOA's shortwave and medium-wave AM stations around the periphery of the zone of conflict provide a thorough blanket of coverage. Broadcasting three hours a day in Serbian and one hour daily in Croatian, VOA is the largest international broadcaster in the region and enjoys a 32 percent listenership in Sarajevo. It also broadcasts in Albanian to Kosovo, another potential flashpoint in the Balkans. 
<p>

	The recent NATO air strikes against Serbs in Bosnia provoked bitter denunciations in Belgrade and in Serb-controlled Bosnia. In Moscow the NATO air campaign against Russia's traditional allies also prompted vocal condemnation. With their tight control of news media, Yugoslav and Bosnian Serb leaders stir up ethnic hatred and keep violent passions high. They black out all information about Serb atrocities and war crimes charges in the West. Disinformation and falsehoods are a major part of their overall strategy. Without the VOA there would be no voice explaining U.S. and Allied actions to the people most involved or rebutting the false charges the Serbs use to legitimize their aggression.
<p>

	VOA recently began a refugee hotline as part of the Serbo-Croatian service. It offers broadcast facilities to reach separated family members in the Balkans, who can call a VOA telephone number and leave a message on the Serbo-Croatian line. VOA then broadcasts the message to reach separated family members. Numerous families have been reunited through this service. 
<p>

	This is more than a humanitarian gesture, one whose exact value is impossible to quantify. If American soldiers ever have to enter Bosnia, for example, as part of a NATO operation to cover the withdrawal of the U.N. Protection Force, America may find out how much it is worth. It is conceivable that the goodwill engendered by this service will save American lives if that day does come.
<p>
	In another volatile region of the world, VOA is broadcasting in Korean to counter the propaganda of the Stalinist North on the Korean Peninsula. In China, VOA is America's link to the most populous nation in the world. China's emergence as a global power and America's relations with the Chinese will be among the defining issues in the 21st century and will affect the future structure of world politics. It is absolutely essential for the U.S. to maintain an active presence there. The audience for VOA's Mandarin service has grown to include 70 percent of China's college students since the 1989 massacre in Tiananmen Square. Such programs as the "Harry Wu Watch," after the arrest of the human rights activist, and "China Forum" generate more than 4,000 faxes and letters to VOA per month from Chinese listeners.

	VOA's Tibetan service recently expanded its broadcasts from a half hour to two hours a day. It is the only independent news source for the Tibetan-speaking areas of the world. In fact, the communist regime in Beijing devotes considerable efforts to jamming the VOA's Chinese and Tibetan broadcasts. Devoting scarce resources to jamming attests eloquently to VOA's effectiveness.
<p>

	In Myanmar, better known as Burma, the democratic opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi recently was freed by the ruling military junta after nearly six years of house arrest. The only reliable sources of this news were the VOA's Burmese language service and the BBC. 
<p>

<b>Surrogate Radios</b>
<p>

In evaluating the role of broadcasting in global strategy, it is important to distinguish between the VOA and the so-called surrogate radios -- Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), Radio Free Asia, and Radio Mart, which broadcasts to Cuba. The mission of the surrogate radio services is to tell listeners what is happening in their own country, to provide information which their own radios would provide if their countries were free. This difference in missions is a matter of U.S. law. The surrogates also have a vital mission, but they do not explain or defend U.S. government policy; nor do they present U.S. values and institutions. That mission is unique to VOA. 
<p>

	 Under the International Broadcasting Act of 1994, federal funding for RFE/RL will end after 1999. And when Fidel Castro's grip on his island prison ends, as it inevitably must, federal funding for the Office of Cuban Broadcasting and Radio Mart probably will end. But there still will be a need for VOA to perform its role as America's voice to the world. 
<p>

	 Ultimately, no information strategy can be a substitute for adequate military power. Force of arms will always be the final argument when nothing else suffices. But it is far better to shape the world's events in advance, if possible, through "soft" means like information. Using broadcasting successfully as a tool of global strategy can create conditions of friendship and convergence of interests that make conflict unnecessary and give America options other than the last resort of armed force. 
<p>


<b>MYTHS ABOUT THE VOA AND U.S. GOVERNMENT BROADCASTING</b>
<P>
Critics of the U.S. government's international broadcasting programs propagate five myths to justify public neglect of the VOA or reduction of its resources.
<p>

<ul>
<li><b>Myth #1: The VOA can be privatized.</b>
<p>
The VOA provides both a means of public diplomacy to promote America's values to the rest of the world and an official voice for the U.S. government to explain and defend its policies. In other words, VOA is an instrument of policy, not just a source of entertainment. Private entities simply cannot carry out this function. Moreover, the VOA's network of facilities is extensive, operating in many remote corners of the world. It is inconceivable that private operations would have the inclination, resources, expertise, or profit-making incentive to take over such an extensive network. In the 1980s the U.S. government invested heavily to upgrade the facilities for international broadcasting. It would be a waste of that investment to curtail VOA's scope just when the return on that investment is beginning to be realized.
<P>

<b><li>Myth #2:. We have CNN and do not need the VOA.</b>
<p>
CNN does not reach an audience as wide, diverse, and strategically targeted as VOA's --. in their own languages. CNN does not provide the same content or policy-significant information; nor does it adequately explain or defend the positions of the United States. In fact, CNN's popular "World Report" program actually does the reverse. Its correspondents feed policy-significant information from foreign governments to the U.S. and other audiences.
<p>
<li><b>Myth #3: The Cold War is over, so the VOA is unnecessary.</b>
<p>
Those who make this assertion have a fundamental misunderstanding of the difference between VOA and the surrogate radios like Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and Radio Mart, which are products of the Cold War. VOA is more necessary than ever to give America a voice in the highly competitive global marketplace where the struggle for democracy and freedom is still being waged. Other nations, many unfriendly to America, are speaking effectively into this marketplace. The revolutionary regime of Iran is a notable example. Why should America now choose not to engage in this vital war of ideas?
<p>

<li><b>Myth #4: Government broadcasting has plenty of fat; all government broadcasting should be cut.</b>
<p>
Since 1992 VOA has reduced its broadcast staff by 25 percent, cut direct broadcast hours from 1,080 to 850 hours weekly, abolished or converted numerous language services, eliminated 14 senior management positions, and cut 170 other line positions to meet mandated budget reductions. VOA is now at a core operating level. Any further cuts will force VOA to eliminate entire language services to critical world regions.
</ul><p>
It can be argued that the need for surrogate radios will diminish over time if and when democracy, accompanied by freedom of information, takes hold in existing dictatorships and formerly totalitarian countries. But VOA needs to stabilize at a funding level commensurate with its vital mission, and not be subjected to further cuts. As stated in a recent Wall Street Journal editorial, "If Congress wants to cut federal broadcasting, the better target is domestic public TV, for which a multitude of commercial alternatives do exist."3 <p><b>EFFECTIVE BROADCASTING REQUIRES ADEQUATE FUNDS</b>
<p>
	The Administration's FY 1996 budget request for VOA is $395 million. But VOA faces a $10 million reduction from the 1996 request mandated by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in the State Department authorization bill. 
<p>
	The Foreign Relations Committee report accompanying the authorization bill acknowledges that budget authority for international broadcasting (not counting the separate radio facilities construction account) in the Foreign Relations Revitalization Act of 1995 is 21 percent below the operating level in 1994 ($487 million). In other words, VOA already is operating at the margins because the agency chose to absorb past funding cuts by reducing staff and broadcast hours across the board in order to keep critical language services on the air. 
<p>
	If Senate appropriators agree to the $385 million recommended by the Foreign Relations Committee, VOA will have to reduce direct broadcasting from 850 to 715 hours per week, eliminate another four language services, and end all shortwave transmissions to Latin America.
<p>
	The situation on the House side is even more bleak. The House Appropriations Committee marked up its State Department appropriations bill before the August recess, providing $341 million, or $54 million below the FY 1996 budget request. The committee's report acknowledges that a cut of this magnitude "could mean a reduction of at least 400 personnel, and the possible cessation of broadcasting in as many as 20 languages. These reductions come on top of the major reorganization/downsizing that occurred because of the 1994 Act (the International Broadcasting Act of 1994), which has resulted in staffing reductions of 900 at RFE/RL and 350 at VOA."
<p>
	If outlays fall to this level, the VOA in effect will cease to be a global broadcaster. America's voice will fall silent in vital corners of the globe as VOA scales down to a narrow regional focus, like Radio Australia or Radio Netherlands. 
<p>
	A cut of this magnitude will allow only 535 hours of weekly broadcasting in about 20 languages, with greatly diminished English transmissions in three of six key global regions. VOA would lose about half of its estimated direct broadcast global audience. 
<p>
	As it completes work on the State Department appropriations bill, Congress should keep in mind that the Clinton Administration's FY 1996 budget request for international broadcasting was inadequate from the start and represents a substantial cut from prior year operating levels. At a bare minimum, House and Senate appropriators should fund the VOA at the $385 million recommended by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
VOA embodies the importance of democratic culture and shared values, not just raw economic interests or military power, as a basis for international relations. America has a natural advantage in promoting U.S. interests and values in the world, unlike dictatorships which have to lie, since most people aspire to the values America represents. 
<p>
	The importance of moral leadership in the world by precept, by reasoning, and by sharing information is vital. It enables America to shape the world without having to use heavy-handed, intrusive means. Broadcasting America's values and views to 100 million people in critical areas of the globe for $395 million per year is money well spent, and a bargain at the price. To cut VOA further is indeed, in the words of VOA Director Geoffrey Cowan, the unilateral disarmament of the Information Age.

INTRODUCTION
<p>
The congressional budget resolution for fiscal year 1996<i>1</i> calls for elimination of the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC). With its many sweeping changes, this resolution is both symbolic of the change in philosophy of this Congress and a very practical proposal to restructure a collection of programs and agencies that have little reason to share a common organizational structure. Legislation has been introduced in both the House and Senate to dismantle the Department of Commerce,<i>2</i> and both the House Commerce Committee and Senate Governmental Affairs Committee have held hearings.<i>3</i> The congressional leadership has indicated that the FY 1996 budget reconciliation bill will include language to close down the Commerce Department.<i>4</i>
<p>
The idea of closing the department comes entirely from Congress. The Administration's reinventing government initiative barely touches the Department of Commerce, which indeed cannot be "reinvented."  The proper course of action is to dismantle the agency, which is little more than a collection of disparate programs. The Commerce Department has 20 undersecretary and assistant secretary offices, six directors and administrators, and 263 political appointees, and shares four budgetary functions with eight other Cabinet and sub-Cabinet departments.
<p>
To close the department, obsolete and outmoded programs should be terminated, and duplicative programs should be consolidated with other departments. Commercial activities should be privatized or ended -- leaving private corporations to pay for their own research, advertising, and other costs of doing business.
<p>
Specifically, Congress should:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Close down the Office of the Secretary and Departmental Administration.
<p>
<li>Use the staff of the Inspector General as the core for the transition work but abolish the office upon completion of this work.
<p>
<li>Close the Economic Development Administration, with outstanding loans to be collected by the Treasury Department.
<p>
<li>Consolidate the Bureau of the Census and other federal statistical agencies, including the Economics and Statistics Administration, within a single new independent agency.
<p>
<li>Transfer trade functions to the Treasury Department, including the International Trade Administration.
<p>
<li>Transfer the Bureau of Export Administration to the Defense Department.
<p>
<li>Close the domestic offices of the U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service.
<p>
<li>Close down the Minority Business Development Agency.
<p>
<li>Close down the Travel and Tourism Administration.
<p>
<li>Transfer the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration -- the major part of the Commerce Department -- to other Cabinet departments that perform similar functions and close down the NOAA Corps.
<p>
<li>Establish the National Weather Service as an independent agency, with commercial services privatized.
<p>
<li>Establish the Patent and Trademark Office as an independent corporation.
<p>
<li>Close down the Office of Technology Policy (Technology Administration).
<p>
<li>Privatize the National Technical Information Service.
<p>
<li>Close down the National Institute of Standards and Technology and transfer residual functions to the National Academy of Engineering.
<p>
<li>Close down the National Telecommunications and Information Administration and privatize electromagnetic spectrum.
<p>
</ul>
A Cabinet department reporting directly to the President of the United States ought to have a clearly defined mission and not continue year after year to function simply as an organization chart, tying together a loose collection of agencies. Defenders of the Commerce Department argue that its various activities are valuable and useful, but no case has been made that these functions cannot be performed in the private sector or elsewhere in government, or that they are more valuable than the budgetary resources consumed.
<p>
Because Commerce would be the first Cabinet department in U.S. history to be dismantled, the absence of clear precedents and procedure presents a challenge for the House and Senate task forces chaired by Representative Dick Chrysler (R-MI) and Senator Spencer Abraham (R-MI). Title I of both their bills establishes a temporary Commerce Programs Resolution Agency modeled after the Resolution Trust Corporation, created by Congress to dispose of the assets of failed thrift institutions closed in the late 1980s. An administrator of this temporary agency, appointed by the President, would have broad powers to "allocate or reallocate any function" according to "a plan for winding up the affairs of the Agency" that the President must submit to Congress within six months. The agency would have three years to terminate programs, reassign civil service personnel, and dispose of surplus property.<i>5</i>
<p>
<br>
<b>THE "DEPARTMENT OF MISCELLANEOUS AFFAIRS"</b>
<p>
According to its own Inspector General, Commerce has evolved into "a loose collection of more than 100 programs delivering services to about 1,000 customer bases."<i>6</i>  The General Accounting Office reports the department "faces the most complex web of divided authorities" and shares "missions with at least 71 federal departments, agencies, and offices."<i>7</i>
<p>
Most of the department's resources have little or no relation to its purported mission:  "encourag[ing], serv[ing], and promot[ing] the Nation's international trade, economic growth, and technological advancement."<i>8</i>  For instance, nearly 60 percent of the agency's budget (about $2 billion per year) and some 37 percent of its staff are in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which conducts a number of environmental programs, including weather-related activities and research programs in marine and atmospheric sciences. Meanwhile, export promotion programs are distributed among ten different federal agencies:  "The U.S. Department of Agriculture, not Commerce, receives about 74 percent of total funding for these programs, although it accounts for only about 10 percent of U.S. exports."<i>9</i>
<p>
Not only are many of the department's other activities -- especially its commercial operations  questionable as federal functions, but most badly need modernization and capital investment. Due to political and budgetary pressures, much of its capital stock is in disrepair. The GAO reports that departmental infrastructure -- "federal laboratories, a fleet of ships, weather satellites and radar, information systems, and other facilities and equipment -- will require investments of at least $7.4 billion over a 15-year period."<i>10</i>  The National Weather Service modernization program "has exceeded its expected cost and is far behind schedule. The initial cost estimate of nearly $2 billion has risen to $4.6 billion," and the projected completion date has slipped from 1994 to 1998.<i>11</i>
<p>
The Department of Commerce cannot be "reinvented."  The optimal course of action is indicated by the congressional budget resolution:  The department should be dismantled. Its obsolete and outmoded programs should be terminated. Its duplicative programs should be consolidated with other departments, and its commercial activities should be privatized or closed.
<p>
The following analysis examines each organizational unit in the Commerce Department and recommends how to terminate or transfer its activities. For reference, data from the President's budget<i>12</i> are included in tables at the head of each section, with full-time employment levels and budget outlays in millions of dollars for fiscal years 1994 through 1997. In addition, major programs are detailed with obligated spending in millions of dollars.
<p>
<br>
<b>Office of the Secretary and Departmental Administration</b><br>
The position of Commerce Secretary was established in 1913 when Labor was separated from the original Department of Commerce and Labor, which was established in 1903. The new agency was supposed to foster modern industrial production, rather than agriculture (which already enjoyed its own Cabinet department for 41 years). 
<p>
The Secretary of Commerce often is portrayed as the advocate of pro-business policies in a President's cabinet.<i>13</i> But public policy decisions affecting business generally are not made in the Commerce Department. Rather they come from such agencies as the President's Economic Council, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Internal Revenue Service, or the Department of the Interior. The Secretary of Commerce, in recent administrations, has served more often as an important fund-raiser for his President's election campaigns than as the architect of policies to help the nation's commerce.
<p>
</b>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b><br> 
The administrative and coordination functions of the Secretary of Commerce and supporting bureaus under his immediate authority should be assigned to a temporary Commerce Programs Resolution Agency, as provided in Title I of the legislation introduced by Representative Chrysler and Senator Abraham. The President would submit to Congress within six months "a plan for winding up the affairs of the Agency," and an administrator appointed by the President would have broad powers to "allocate or reallocate any function."  This temporary agency would have no more than three years to execute the legislative mandate:  terminating programs, reassigning civil service personnel, and disposing of surplus property.<i>14</i>
<p>
<b>Inspector General</b><br>
The Office of Inspector General was established in 1978 to provide agency-wide audits and investigations and to recommend corrections for waste, fraud, and mismanagement.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b> 
<p>
Congress should close the Office of Inspector General, although its personnel could form the core staff for the temporary Commerce Programs Resolution Agency established by the Chrysler-Abraham legislation.
<p>
<b>Economic Development Administration</b><br>
During the Johnson Administration, the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 established a program of grants and other financial assistance to targeted cities and rural regions identified as "economically distressed."  The Economic Development Administration (EDA) also operates the Revolving Loan Fund, lending money to state and local governments that they in turn lend to businesses. The EDA will spend roughly $362 million in fiscal 1995 and $401 million in fiscal 1996.<i>15</i>
<p>
<br>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b><br> 
Congress should close down the Economic Development Administration and direct the U.S. Treasury to collect all outstanding loans.<i>16</i> Congress approved $408 million in EDA spending for fiscal 1995, including $202 million for public works, $26 million in planning grants, $120 million for defense economic conversion, and $45 million in economic adjustment grants.<i>17</i> The EDA's development functions duplicate the activities of programs within the departments of Agriculture, Defense, Interior, and Housing and Urban Development, the Appalachian Regional Commission, the Small Business Administration, and the Tennessee Valley Authority.<i>18</i> On these grounds alone the program should be terminated.
<p>
Throughout the EDA's history, grants have been used by Members of Congress to distribute favors to constituents by "earmarking" funding to projects, bypassing the formal hearing process. This often means EDA grants go to locations with healthy economies that do not need federal assistance. In fact, the 17 states represented by the members of the relevant House and Senate subcommittees received $1.10 per capita in EDA grants during 1994, compared with 68 cents per capita in those states without representation, despite the fact that the average unemployment rate for the states represented was only 5.2 percent, compared with the national average of 5.4 percent that year.
<p>
The pork-barrel projects funded in the FY 1995 appropriation bill include:
<p>
<b>Egegik, Alaska.</b> The small fishing village of Egegik, with a population of 101, rests on the western shore of Alaska. Egegik has a per capita income of nearly $20,000 and is home to 23 families with an average family income of more than $60,000. Yet, in 1994, EDA granted the village $826,000 for the construction of a public dock. This is the equivalent of $8,178 for every person in Egegik.
<p>
<b>Key Biscayne, Florida.</b> A town of 8,854 residents, Key Biscayne is located in the middle of one of the most popular vacation spots in the country. Taking advantage of its beautiful climate and year-round influx of tourists, the local population enjoys a per capita income of more than $37,500. Yet Key Biscayne was awarded a 1994 EDA grant of $750,000 for the installation of a storm sewer system.
<p>
<b>St. Cloud, Minnesota.</b> St. Cloud University was awarded $91,512 in 1994 for the rehabilitation of its university center. According to EDA guidelines, these centers "must focus on service areas with significant economic distress."<i>19</i>  But this area hardly qualifies as distressed; St. Cloud has an unemployment rate of 3.0 percent and an above-average per capita income. Minnesota's unemployment rate is 3.2 percent, the fourth lowest in the nation.
<p>
Almost all federal development programs, moreover, have proven to be expensive failures. Federal public works, job training, and regional development programs create few new jobs for the considerable amounts of money they cost to administer.<i>20</i> As a typical example, the General Accounting Office noted that no more than 35 percent of the beneficiaries of the Emergency Jobs Act of 1983 actually had been unemployed.<i>21</i> Another analysis suggested that only 84 previously unemployed people received jobs under the program at a cost of some $307,000 per job. The average private-sector job costs only about $40,000 to create.<i>22</i> Congress could do far more to spur economic development by closing down the EDA and using the savings to reduce the tax burden faced by private-sector employers, who are in a better position to create jobs.
<p>
The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, which has  jurisdiction over the sections of the Commerce Department Dismantling Act that abolish EDA, voted instead on August 2 to support a measure that would preserve all of the pork barrel substance of the program.<i>23</i> It creates a new Undersecretary of Commerce and an Office of Economic Development to "replace" the current EDA and authorizes funding of $340 million per year for five years. Section 605 of the legislation even contains a provision to assure that EDA's functions will survive the elimination of the Commerce Department.
<p>
The proposed substitute bill adopts the model of the Appalachian Regional Commission, established in 1965 as a temporary response to poverty in 13 states, which today continues to provide highway construction grants and other financial aid to those states and local governments. The House committee not only reauthorized the Appalachian Regional Commission for five years, it created eight additional regional commissions as independent agencies, administering grants and loans for spending on government-financed projects. Up to 45 percent of the United States would qualify for pork barrel spending based on the following eligibility criteria:  per capita income of 80 percent or less of the national average; or an unemployment rate one percent above the national average for the most recent 24-month period; or sudden and severe job loss; or "a pocket of poverty."<i>24</i>
<p>
This effort by the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee is extremely ill-advised. The proposal for a group of regional commissions to hand out grants and below-cost loans will only perpetuate and expand the unsound practices of subsidizing construction projects for political gain. 
<p>
<b>Bureau of the Census</b><br>
The Bureau of the Census was established as a permanent office in 1902. In addition to conducting the decennial census as required by the U.S. Constitution, the bureau continuously gathers and tabulates a wide range of economic and demographic statistics.
<p>
<br>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p> 
Congress should transfer the U.S. Census Bureau to a new independent agency, a Bureau of National Statistics, which would house all data collection functions of the government. Former Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Janet L. Norwood, in her recent <i>Organizing to Count:  Change in the Federal Statistical System,</i> puts forth a practical and detailed proposal for such reorganization.<i>25</i> A centralized statistical agency for the United States, similar to that of Canada, also was recommended in The Heritage Foundation's <i>Rolling Back Government:  A Budget Plan to Rebuild America 26</i> and by the National Association of Business Economists.<i>27</i>
<p>
Section 207 of the Chrysler-Abraham legislation would transfer the Census Bureau to the Treasury Department, which already performs substantial data collection in administering the Internal Revenue Code and collecting customs duties. The House and Senate task forces set out to reduce the size of government, not merely to rename existing bureaucracies (although Census would remain under their bill), so they call for no new independent federal agencies. But the benefits from establishing an independent Bureau of National Statistics are substantial. One of the most important would be to take statistical functions out of politicized bureaucracies and place them in an agency with no policy functions, thereby helping to insure that data collection is not influenced by political considerations.<i>28</i>
<p>
<b>Economics and Statistics Administration</b><br>
The Bureau of Economic Analysis was established by the Secretary of Commerce in 1953. It reports to the Undersecretary for Economic Affairs, who also oversees the Census Bureau. The two agencies together are known as the Economics and Statistics Administration, although the much larger Census Bureau is always identified separately. The agency draws upon the work of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Census Bureau, and other data collection sources to compile the national income and product accounts and prepare forecasts and indicators of economic activity, widely followed by the news media and economists.
<p>
<br>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p>
Congress should incorporate the Bureau of Economic Analysis (along with the Census Bureau) within an independent Bureau of National Statistics, which would be responsible for all economic and demographic data collection and analysis for the federal government. Statistical functions of the Departments of Agriculture, Education, Energy, Health, and Labor also should be merged within the new agency.
<p>
Section 208 of the Chrysler-Abraham legislation provides for transfer of the Bureau of Economic Analysis to the Federal Reserve System, which already performs substantial data collection as part of its banking regulation and monetary policy functions. As with the Census Bureau, sponsors are reluctant to establish any new federal agencies. The independent Federal Reserve, however, should not be assigned functions by Congress only tangentially related to its central role of monetary policy and policing the nation's payments system.
<p>
<b>International Trade Administration</b><br>
The International Trade Administration (ITA) was established in 1980 by the Secretary of Commerce and also encompasses the Bureau of Export Administration. The ITA is charged with promoting U.S. exports, both through "export promotion" advocacy and diplomatic intervention by Commerce officials. It also processes petitions by U.S. industries seeking antidumping duties, countervailing duties, and other retaliatory weapons to erect trade barriers against foreign producers and products.<i>29</i>
<p>
The Undersecretary for International Affairs also runs numerous other programs, such as the U.S. Foreign and Commercial Service, which target a handful of industries for export development. The Undersecretary has a Deputy Undersecretary and a Director of Administration, as well as a Deputy Assistant Secretary for Planning and three other Assistant Secretaries, plus the Director General of the U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (which has offices in 68 countries throughout the world as well as 47 district offices and 21 branch offices in the United States).
<p>
<br>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p> 
Congress should transfer all Department of Commerce trade policy and trade law enforcement activities to the Treasury Department. An Undersecretary of the Treasury for International Trade should be created to assume all functions of the present Undersecretary of Commerce for International Trade, including direction of the Import Administration, Trade Development, and the Foreign Commercial Service (see chart above). The new Treasury Undersecretary would have the same relative status within a Cabinet department, and the trade functions would complement and reinforce the Treasury Department's current role as the principal agency for international economic policy. There should be no change in the duties of the current Undersecretary of the Treasury for International Affairs.
<p>
The Secretary of the Treasury is the government's principal officer for international economic policy. The Treasury Department has exclusive jurisdiction over all U.S. international economic relations, except trade policy. Outside the United States, the Secretary of Commerce is perceived correctly as a minor Cabinet officer. The Secretary of the Treasury is responsible for U.S. currency exchange rates, U.S. policy in the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, and macroeconomic coordination among the G-7 industrialized countries. Except for the President, the Treasury Secretary has always been the chief spokesman for U.S. economic interests internationally. The more central role assumed by trade policy in the post-Cold War era requires greater coordination with other international economic functions -- a magnification of influence that only a Treasury Secretary can bring to the task.
<p>
To elevate the importance of enforcing U.S. international trade agreements, a central concern of both U.S. exporters and domestic industries, the Secretary of the Treasury should be given clear authority for all international economic functions. The Treasury Department currently is responsible for all enforcement relating to matters involving taxation of transnational corporations, and this has important trade-related consequences. The Customs Service, within Treasury, is the enforcement agency for any trade regulations issued by the Commerce Department.
<p>
As international trade grows, an increasing share consists of intermediate products and semifinished goods. This raises questions concerning the correct pricing of these imports and exports, both for determining taxable U.S. income and for accurately measuring the value of trade. The growing problem of fraudulent invoicing of traded goods affects taxation, balance of payments, and money laundering violations -- all of which are Treasury Department concerns.<i>30</i>
<p>
Section 204 of the Department of Commerce Dismantling Act, which has been considered in hearings before the House Commerce Committee and the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, transfers all international trade functions of the Department of Commerce to the United States Trade Representative (USTR). The USTR is an extremely effective but small agency within the Executive Office of the President, with fewer than 170 employees, which conducts all trade negotiations and represents the United States in the World Trade Organization. A major reorganization of the USTR would be required to place all trade functions and more than 2,500 additional employees there. The USTR's mission would change dramatically from trade policy negotiation, closely linked to the President's economic leadership among world leaders, to enforcement of U.S. trade laws and promotion of exports. Most witnesses at the recent congressional hearings expressed concerns about this change.
<p>
The prospect of such a major change in the USTR has revived interest in a proposal introduced in previous years to create a Cabinet-level Department of International Trade. Representative John L. Mica (R-FL) has introduced legislation<i>31</i> to establish a U.S. Trade Administration, headed by a "U.S. Trade Representative" but actually performing the functions of a Cabinet department. The current role performed by the USTR would be performed by a Deputy USTR for Negotiations within the new department. Representative Mica argues that "a new cabinet department" is not being established because the current USTR already enjoys "cabinet status."  But moving the USTR out of the Executive Office of the President into a new agency, along with the corresponding demotion to "deputy" status of the actual negotiators of trade agreements, suggests the contrary.
<p>
Creating a new Cabinet-level department to replace the USTR is not only contrary to the intent of Congress in the budget resolution, but also would change completely the USTR's function in American trade policy. The President's trade negotiator has always worked directly with the highest ranking officers of other governments and has been most effective as the personal envoy of the head of state. In recent years, direct meetings between heads of state have played an increasing role in international economic relations. The Executive Office of the President requires a negotiation team like the USTR. The insulation of trade policy development from the subsequent administration of trade agreements and other political concerns gives the USTR a necessary flexibility in resolving disputes with foreign governments that is quite different from the routine administrative methods of government bureaucracies.
<p>
Any new trade agency outside the Treasury Department would fail to carry the authority that trade policy requires. It would remain a minor voice in the Cabinet. As a part of the Treasury Department, international trade issues would have the same relative status within a Cabinet department as they now enjoy, but an Undersecretary in the principal agency for international economic policy would have more influence in the Administration.
<p>
<b>Improve the Administration of U.S. Trade Policy.</b> During the Carter Administration, Congress transferred responsibility for trade policy from the Treasury Department to the new International Trade Administration in Commerce because the Secretary of the Treasury had failed to correct a number of organizational problems. Most important, the Department failed to define and delegate responsibilities for administering U.S. trade laws effectively. The Treasury Department was unenthusiastic about enforcing textile and steel quotas, to the dismay of those industries and their supporters in Congress. The 1994 GATT Uruguay Agreement on textile quotas and other non-tariff trade barriers has removed those concerns. Today, a transfer  --  without substantial reorganization  --  of the position of Undersecretary of International Trade to the Treasury Department would protect and enhance U.S. interests in international trade by preserving a clear line of authority for administering U.S. trade laws and giving it more prominent Cabinet status.
<p>
<br>
<b>Bureau of Export Administration</b><br>
The seven-year-old Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) administers export controls and coordinates the 17-nation Committee on Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM). The BXA's primary mission, therefore, is to safeguard the national interest by monitoring the export of potentially dangerous "dual-use" technologies.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p>  
Congress should transfer the Bureau of Export Administration to the Defense Department. Controlling the export of militarily useful commodities is a national security matter. If such technologies proliferate, the burden falls on the military to solve the problem. The Department of Defense deserves to be involved directly in the export licensing process because it is in the best position to judge the military utility of particular technologies. Putting the responsibility for export controls in the hands of the USTR or the Treasury Department implies that export controls should be treated as a trade issue, not a national security issue. It would be appropriate, however, for controversial licensing decisions to be appealed to the presidential level.
<p>
A special interagency report issued by the DOC with the Departments of Defense, Energy, and State drew attention to the duplication of export control programs by the BXA. The four-agency report concluded:  "Consolidating these functions under the appropriate official will provide not only the proper oversight but also a more efficient and effective approach for tracking referred applications and examining export trends."<i>32</i>
<p>
The bill introduced by Senator Abraham transfers BXA functions to the Defense Department, but the version introduced in the House of Representatives by Representative Chrysler transfers export licensing to the State Department.<i>33</i> The legislation introduced by Representative Mica transfers all export licensing functions to the proposed new Cabinet department for trade.<i>34</i> Both the Chrysler and Mica proposals would introduce greater uncertainty for key U.S. export industries such as aircraft, chemicals, and computer technology. Transferring all BXA responsibilities to the Defense Department would correct the problem of administrative conflicts between agencies, but exporters will object that dual-use technology sales will still be made by other countries. New procedures for review of the Defense Department's licensing decisions at the presidential level are needed to address this concern. The USTR, as the President's trade envoy, would be able to address these problems in trade policy and work to stop foreign export sales of dual-use technology.<i>35</i>
<p>
<b>Minority Business Development Agency</b><br>
The Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) was created by executive order in 1971 to help promote the development of minority-owned businesses and to show these businesses how to secure government contracts. The MBDA also provides funds for numerous Minority Business Development Centers (MBDCs) and American Indian Development Centers (IBDCs). Congress appropriated nearly $45 million for this program in fiscal 1995.
<p>
<br>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p>  
Congress should close down the Minority Business Development Agency.<i>36</i> Although hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent on the MBDA since 1971, it has never been authorized formally by Congress. The MBDA's stated objective is to show businesses how to get government contracts, which is hardly the best way to encourage minority business development. Its approach merely duplicates the efforts of the failed 8(a) loan program of the Small Business Administration. Numerous reports have criticized this kind of preference program lending, finding that many of the small businesses favored by these kinds of programs are never able to stand alone without government assistance.<i>37</i>
<p>
In recent years, Congress has altered the MBDA's mission toward what is best described as corporate welfare, subsidizing high-technology firms and university research projects. These questionable expenditures duplicate dozens of other wasteful federal programs and seem little more than an attempt to justify the existence of an agency whose only rationale is dispensing special-interest funds.
<p>
The most effective way for Congress to help small minority-owned businesses would be to repeal labor regulations that generally frustrate small start-up firms and to amend the tax code to encourage investment in new small enterprises. In addition, minority firms serving the public sector would be helped by repeal of such discriminatory laws as the Davis-Bacon Act of 1931 and Service Contract Act of 1965. These laws raise the costs of government construction and service contracts by requiring companies that bid for such contracts to file mountains of paperwork documenting that they pay their workers above-market wages. Larger firms, which tend not to be minority-owned, have the advantage in bidding on such contracts. Repealing these laws would create a level playing field, instantly making smaller firms more competitive.
<p>
<b>Travel and Tourism Administration</b><br>
Created in 1981, the U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration (USTTA) spends nearly $20 million per year supposedly to promote tourism and recreational activities by conducting surveys, distributing promotional material, and running regional marketing shows. The USTTA administers the Disaster Relief Financial Assistance Program, which supports tourism for states recently hit by natural disasters. A new program is "developing a regional and global understanding within Governments on the relation between tourism and the environment."<i>38</i>
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p>
Congress should close down the U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration.<i>39</i> There is no reason for the federal government to be involved in an activity already well handled by a vast private travel and tourism industry. In 1992, over 45 million foreign travelers visited the United States. These tourists spent more than $55 billion in this country, including $17 billion in fares to U.S. air carriers. 
<p>
Private industry thus has a significant financial interest in promoting tourism and does not need taxpayers to pay its advertising costs. The agency often works with private-sector organizations, including the Travel Industry Association of America, to organize events such as the "Discover America International Pow Wow" or the "Pow Wow Europe."  There is no justification for federal involvement in such commercial promotional activities, with taxpayer funds used to pay for normal business marketing costs. Tourist promotion should be organized by private-sector interests without taxpayer assistance. The federal government does not belong in the travel industry.
<p>
<b>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</b><br>
The $2 billion-per-year National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) was formed in 1970 to consolidate commercially oriented ocean resource activities housed in other government agencies. NOAA's non-weather-related programs include a broad range of unrelated activities, such as commercial fisheries management, endangered species protection, habitat management, and research projects.<i>40</i>
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p> 
Congress should (1) separate the National Weather Service from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), establishing it as an independent agency with its functions reduced to specialized data collection and emergency warning activities,<i>41</i> and (2) reduce by 50 percent all non-Weather Service NOAA funding over five years. The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) should be transferred to the current Department of Interior. Most functions of the National Ocean Service should be privatized, and the NOAA Corps and NOAA Fleet should be closed down. To accomplish this, Congress should:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Return the functions performed by the National Marine Fisheries Service to what are now the Departments of Interior and Agriculture and the Coast Guard.<i>42</i>
<p>
<li>Impose fees on commercial and recreational fishing interests for fishing in federal waters. These fees should be sufficient to cover the costs associated with managing federal fishing stocks.
<p>
<li>Privatize most National Ocean Service functions.
<p>
<li>Terminate the NOAA Corps and NOAA Fleet.<i>43</i>
<p>
</ul>
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) consumes nearly 60 percent of the budget of the Department of Commerce and about 37 percent of its staff. NOAA oversees three significant non-Weather Service agencies:  the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), the National Ocean Service (NOS), and the NOAA Corps and NOAA Fleet. Many functions of these programs can be moved to other agencies, terminated, privatized, or turned over to the states.
<p>
The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) is the primary agency managing marine mammal and commercial fisheries resources in federal marine waters. Savings can be achieved by transferring NMFS fisheries and protected species management activities to the Department of Interior's Fish and Wildlife Service. NMFS fisheries monitoring and enforcement activities can be transferred to the Coast Guard, which already has policing powers over federal waters. Specific fisheries management functions can be transferred to the regional councils in New England, the Pacific Northwest, and the Gulf states. Federal funding should be ended for state fisheries grants, commercial fisheries promotion and development programs, and aquaculture research. The seafood inspection program could be transferred to the FDA inspection program.
<p>
Currently, unlike commercial interests that use public lands and extract minerals, the commercial and recreational fishing industries pay nothing for the right to fish in federal waters. Because these resources are considered free, and because the industry is overcapitalized as the result of government loan and fishing vessel construction programs, the federal fishing stock is rapidly becoming depleted. Indeed, the government has paid millions in income supplements to Northeast fisherman who have seen their profits fall due to depleted stocks. It also spends millions on fisheries recovery programs, stock surveys, and hatcheries. The industry that benefits from these programs contributes nothing to their cost.
<p>
Charging commercial and recreational fishing interests a fee or requiring them to pay a royalty to the federal government would place a premium on fishing in federal waters. Such a fee system would help defray the cost of resource management and a smaller fishing fleet would reduce the stress placed on federal fishing stocks that has forced a moratorium on fishing from many ports.
<p>
The National Ocean Service (NOS) engages in such diverse activities as mapping and charting, oil spill research, coastal monitoring, and marine sanctuary management. Savings can be achieved by privatizing the agency's navigational and aeronautical charting and mapping activities currently performed by its National Geodetic Survey office.<i>44</i> The Geodetic Survey has its origins in the Coast and Geodetic Survey, created by President Thomas Jefferson in 1807 to chart navigational routes. There already are private companies drafting and marketing aeronautical services. Those activities that cannot be privatized should be transferred to the Coast Guard.
<p>
In addition, all regional coastal management programs, such as the $45 million Coastal Zone Management grant program and the $1 million Charleston area management plan, should be terminated and continued by state authorities if they choose to do so. Marine sanctuary programs can be merged into the Department of Interior or transferred to state governments.
<p>
The NOAA Corps also has its origins in the Coast and Geodetic Survey. Today the Corps operates a fleet of 18 research vessels, as well as ten fixed-wing aircraft and four helicopters. All of these functions should be terminated. The NOAA Corps is outmoded, and its research fleet, reports the GAO, is "old and technologically obsolete."  NOAA is calling for a 15-year, $1.9 billion program to modernize and purchase 24 vessels but "has no assurance that its fleet modernization plan represents the most cost-effective means of meeting future program requirements."<i>45</i>  Many of the Corps' charting activities are duplicated by private companies or the Coast Guard and need not be continued; its ships should be given to universities and marine research centers, and its aircraft to the Air Force. Hurricane research now can be performed entirely through satellites.
<p>
<b>National Weather Service</b><br>
The primary function of the National Weather Service (NWS) is to issue warnings of severe weather and floods in order to minimize life and property loss. The National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service -- an NWS adjunct -- operates the satellites producing the data the NWS uses to conduct its forecasts. The combined budgets of these programs comprise over half of NOAA's nearly $2 billion annual budget.
<p>
<br>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b><br> 
Congress should reduce funding for the National Weather Service by 50 percent over three years. The Weather Service should reduce its role by specializing in data collection and emergency warning efforts. NOAA's satellite program could be merged with the redundant Air Force weather satellite program. An assessment then should be made of the possibility of privatizing polar-orbiting satellites and information distribution functions.<i>46</i>
<P>
Due to mismanagement and bureaucratic inefficiencies, the reputation of the National Weather Service is under fire. For example, according to the General Accounting Office, its modernization program "has exceeded its expected cost and is far behind schedule. The initial cost estimate of nearly $2 billion has risen to $4.6 billion," and the projected completion date has slipped from 1994 to 1998.<i>47</i> The only way to salvage this program is to reduce it to its core functions and introduce a significant dose of competition and private-sector capital.
<p>
Many functions of the Weather Service should be contracted out to private firms or simply transferred to the private sector. There are now approximately 300 private companies in the U.S. preparing and disseminating weather forecasts to businesses and the public on a commercial basis. According to the Commercial Weather Services Association, "private meteorologists and for-profit companies provide the public upwards of 85 percent of its weather forecasts, through television weathercasts, in newspaper weather maps, and on radio."<i>48</i>
<p>
The Weather Service should turn over to private firms its specialized services, such as fruit frost and agricultural forecasting, aviation forecasting, and fire weather forecasting, and privatize or close the regional climate centers that compete directly with private firms.<i>49</i> In addition, the Service spends about $200 million per year in "fringe" weather operations -- such as Seasonal to Interannual Climate Forecasts and Decadal to Centennial Change -- which have little scientific validity and no practical value. These should be terminated.
<p>
The Service's field structure should be consolidated. The NWS has five headquarters offices, six regional offices, four national centers, and 334 field offices. This field office structure was designed when technology did not allow instant communication. Little has been done to alter this outmoded structure. Reducing these offices to no more than 25 facilities would save millions each year.
<p>
The Clinton Administration's FY 1996 budget proposes privatizing such specialized NWS services as aviation, marine, and agricultural forecasting. The Office of Management and Budget projects these measures will save $40 million over five years. These recommendations are a small but good beginning.
<p>
<b>Patent and Trademark Office</b><br>
The patent system was established by the first Congress "to promote the progress of the useful arts" under Article I, Section 8, of the U.S. Constitution. The registration of trademarks was first authorized in 1870. About 110,000 patents and about 69,700 trademarks were registered for fiscal 1992 alone, and 5,700 trademark registrations were renewed. A substantial portion of the annual Patent Office budget is funded by fees and other payments for publication and services by the public.
<p>
<br>
What Congress Should Do:
<p>
Section 205 of the Chrysler-Abraham legislation places the Patent and Trademark Office under the jurisdiction of the Justice Department. Other alternatives also have been proposed. Representative Carlos J. Moorhead (R-CA) has introduced legislation<i>50</i> to establish an independent government corporation, an idea favored by the American Bar Association's Section on Patent, Trademark, and Copyright Law.<i>51</i> An independent corporation, as proposed by the ABA, is clearly superior because this function can be fully self-financing. Documenting the ownership of patent and trademark rights is an activity that provides specific economic value to private parties, who can enforce these rights in civil lawsuits.
<p>
<b>Technology Administration (Office of Technology Policy)</b><br>
The Technology Administration (TA) was created in 1988 as a successor to the Office of Productivity, Technology, and Innovation. This program oversees the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) and the National Technical Information Service (NTIS), which are intended to promote commercially useable technology through research grants and subsidies. The office of the Undersecretary for Technology is an example of administrative overhead that can be eliminated by dismantling the Department of Commerce. The Undersecretary for Technology exercises executive and policy direction over the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the National Technological Information Service, which is one of the largest publishing firms in the United States. The principal functions of the office, however, are to send representatives to interdepartmental meetings throughout the federal government and to supervise public relations activities, such as the Malcolm Baldrige Quality Awards.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p> 
Congress should close down the Technology Administration. The National Technical Information Service should be closed or privatized. The National Institute of Standards and Technology's Advanced Technology Program, in addition to the Manufacturing Extension Partnerships program,<i>52</i> also should be abolished. The technology programs represent most clearly the failed theories of government-industry "partnership," in which bureaucrats pick projects to subsidize and encourage private-sector interests to pursue government funding rather than to invest in entrepreneurial research. The House of Representatives has voted to discontinue funding for the Advanced Technology Program.<i>53</i>
<p>
<b>National Technical Information Service</b><br>
The National Technical Information Service is a publishing firm within the federal government which collects and disseminates scientific, technical, engineering, and business-related information generated by government and foreign sources. It provides databases and other computer services to private-sector and governmental clients and essentially covers its costs by setting prices for its publications and services.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p>
Congress should privatize the National Technical Information Service. The NTIS is required by law to pay its own costs and usually does so. This Commerce Department program is essentially a publishing business which already prices its products and services to those who benefit from them. Since it has proven itself able to operate in a businesslike way on its own, it should be privatized immediately.
<p>
<b>National Institute of Standards and Technology</b><br>
Most of Commerce's recent growth in spending is due to increases in the budget for industrial policy funding of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Overall, outlays for NIST are scheduled under current law to skyrocket from $167 million in FY 1994 to $466 million in FY 1995 -- a 180 percent increase in one year. The Clinton Administration's FY 1996 budget proposes that outlays for NIST nearly double by FY 1997, to $1.02 billion.
<p>
NIST's primary role is to promote commercial research and development projects. It carries out this mission through research projects and grant programs such as the Advanced Technology Program (ATP) and Manufacturing Extension Partnerships(MEPs).<i>54</i> In FY 1996, the Clinton Administration proposes a 622 percent increase in budget authority for ATP, when compared with 1993 levels. MEP budget authority will jump by 716 percent over the same period under the Administration proposal. NIST, once called the National Bureau of Standards, also sets industry standards for various technological goods and services.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b><br>
Congress should close down the National Institute of Standards and Technology. This means ending NIST's Advanced Technology Program and its Scientific and Technical Research and Services, in addition to halting construction of new NIST research facilities. Weights and measures and other standards can be supervised by the National Academy of Engineering.
<p>
Although the Clinton Administration and many in Congress believe industrial policy initiatives like NIST are the key to America's competitive success, the exact opposite is true. Industrial policy programs rarely encourage the development of vibrant new industries, and when they do it is usually at very high cost. More important, NIST already shows signs of becoming one of the federal government's leading high-technology pork-barrel programs, replacing highway and other infrastructure programs. 
<p>
NIST should be abolished before any more harm is done to the economy and before any more taxpayer dollars are distributed wastefully to favored interest groups. Its research programs and facilities could be privatized very quickly. Robert M. White, president of the National Academy of Engineering, notes that such transformations have been proved successful even for organizations funded exclusively with federal money. White argues that privatization of federal R&D labs makes sense because, "With their new freedom to pursue research in whatever areas the market demands -- rather than just fulfilling government missions -- these laboratories might, if successful, spin-off companies and attract new businesses at a far greater rate than they do today. Research universities and private R&D companies with less governmental direction of their activities tend to contribute significantly to their region's economies."<i>55</i>
<p>
<b>National Telecommunications and Information Administration</b><br>
The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) jointly manages the electromagnetic spectrum with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The NTIA also gives Public Telecommunications Facilities Program (PTFP) grants to public television and radio organizations to help expand the audience for public programming. The newest NTIA promotional effort, the National Information Infrastructure (NII), hopes to channel funds into various "information highway" projects. Although an estimated $70 million - $100 million is to be spent on such projects in 1995, the Administration has set higher funding goals of $1 billion - $2 billion annually for future years.<i>56</i>
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p>
Congress should cut by 75 percent the National Telecommunications and Information Administration and transfer the remaining functions (those concerning oversight of public bands of the radio spectrum) to the Federal Communications Commission.<i>57</i> These functions then would be phased out with the FCC as the entire spectrum is privatized.
<p>
Efforts like the Public Telecommunications Facilities and Information Infrastructure programs are little more than high-technology pork projects. But whether it is spectrum management or public programming promotional efforts, the NTIA has little reason to be independent from the FCC. Communications policy should be embodied in one agency to minimize duplication and cut costs. Hence, all current NTIA tasks, after funding has been reduced 75 percent, should be transferred to the FCC. In addition, Congress should not allow the FCC to use the transfer of authority as an excuse to increase its budget. This should encourage the FCC to reform and simplify federal spectrum management policies, which are inefficient and discourage the advance of telecommunications competition.<i>58</i> Congress's goal should be to place all spectrum into private hands as rapidly as possible, abolish the FCC, and transfer responsibility under international spectrum management treaties to the State Department.

<p>
	Consolidating federal job training programs and giving the funds to the states in the form of block grants is a major part of the Senate welfare reform debate. Because statistics indicate that more education leads to better-paying jobs, Congress and others assume that job training programs work. Unfortunately, they don't. Rather than focusing on who should have responsibility for job training programs, Congress must ask itself a fundamental question:  Why should we continue to spend taxpayer money on programs that don't work? 
<p>
	Job training programs, although well-intentioned, have not proven effective in raising the long-term hourly earnings of participants. They do not achieve this primary goal -- better-paying jobs -- because there is little, if anything, the government can do to alter the effect of neglecting the first 12 years of school.1 What is needed are more fundamental changes aimed at reducing illegitimacy and encouraging individuals to complete high school. Welfare reform that focuses on these two goals will reduce the demand for government job training programs that do not work.<p>	After 30 years, thousands of local job training programs, and hundreds of billions of dollars spent, only a few dozen job training programs have been subject to rigorous evaluation. The few rigorous studies that have been conducted generally fail to show that job training significantly increases long-term hourly earnings. Process-based performance measures traditionally have been the easier, but inappropriate, method for determining whether these programs work. But performance measures can be manipulated easily to explain away poor results by those with an interest in holding on to federal job training money. If federal funding for job training is to continue, rigorous control group studies of these programs must be required.2 Without these studies, American taxpayers will never know whether they are funding effective programs or just throwing good money after bad. 
<p>

<b>FEW STUDIES AND DISMAL RESULTS</b>
<p>
	Federal and state job training programs are intended to enable participants to build productive skills that will provide them with higher real wages. Only a few job training programs have ever been subject to rigorous evaluations, and the results show a record of failure.3 As a report from the Secretary of Labor points out, "there are many areas where little thorough and reliable evaluation evidence is available."4  The few solid studies that have been conducted generally fail to show any significant increase in the hourly earnings of participants directly related to job training.<p>A national controlled scientific study of the Title II-A programs of the Job Training and Partnership Act (JTPA) reported these dismal findings:5<P><ul><li>	The program had no statistically significant effect on either the average earnings of young females or their employment.

<li>	The program had a large (7.9 percent) negative effect on the earnings of young males and no effect on their employment.

<li>	The program had no statistically significant effect on the average earnings of adult men.

<li>	Although the overall program had a small (3.4 percent) effect on the average hourly wage of adult women, classroom training did not have any statistically significant effect. Further, training for those adult women that received welfare or were high school dropouts had no statistically significant effect on earnings.

<li>	Immediate placement in a job did have a small effect on earnings, but not on higher hourly wages. The increase in earnings was due primarily to working more hours rather than to higher hourly wages.
</ul><p>
Further, in 1991 the General Accounting Office found that the majority of service delivery areas underreported administrative expenditures, resulting in a misrepresentation of program costs and amounting to a circumvention of the statutory limitation placed on administrative costs.6 <p>A controlled scientific study of the Summer Training and Employment Program (STEP) reported these disappointing findings:7<p><ul><li>	After two to three years, STEP graduates did not have higher graduation rates or grades than the control group.	<li>Graduates of STEP were no more likely to be working than the control group.</ul><p>A scientific control group study of the Job Corps, one of the most expensive job training programs, has never been conducted. However, a 1982 quasi-experimental study found these results:8  <p><ul><li>	Job Corps did not significantly help single mothers (the largest number of welfare recipients).<li>	Job Corps did not affect the overall arrest rate.<li>	Further, a report by the Department of Labor's Inspector General found that only 17 percent of the Job Corps funding went to educational and vocational training, compared to 26 percent for administration.9 A study by the General Accounting Office also raised "serious concerns about the validity of job placement information."10  The GAO was unable to verify job placement for 15 percent of their Job Corps sample. After 30 years and billions of dollars spent, this program has never been subject to rigorous evaluation and only recently has begun to determine the employment status of Job Corps students.11</ul><p>A controlled scientific study of the Jobstart program also reported disappointing findings:12<p><ul><li>	There was no significant increase in overall employment or earnings for the total four-year study period or for any individual year.

<li>	The program did not reduce welfare receipt.

<li>	Jobstart did not affect overall arrest rates. 
</ul><p>
A controlled study of the Teenage Parent Demonstration program reported only very small improvements in earnings:13<P><ul><li>	This demonstration project clearly indicates there are incentives associated with reducing welfare benefits to single mothers who do not stay in school or get a job. AFDC grants were reduced by $160 for those who chose not to participate.

<li>	However, even this significant penalty increased enrollment in school, job training, or employment by only 13 percentage points and annual earnings by only $300.

<LI>	There was no improvement in the poverty rate for participants.
<p></ul>
Controlled studies of the WIN and JOBS programs reported only very small initial improvements in earnings, and these tend to "fade out" after five years:14<p><ul><li>	The main effect of these programs is to speed up the transition from welfare to work.

<li>	There was only a small increase in average earnings per year, about $300 to $700, and after five years there was no difference in earnings between the control group and the group that participated in the program.

<li>	In most cases the increases in literacy skills and educational attainment did not translate into increased earnings or employment.15</ul><p>A study by the General Accounting Office also found that the Department of Health and Human Services "does not know whether JOBS is reducing welfare dependency because it does not gather enough information on critical program outcomes."16<p><b>CONCLUSION</b><p>	After 30 years, thousands of local job training programs, and hundreds of billions of dollars spent, only a few dozen job training programs have been subject to rigorous evaluation. The few studies that have been conducted generally fail to show any significant long-term increase in hourly earnings directly related to job training. Performance measures and benchmarks are easy but unsatisfactory means of determining whether or not these programs work. They are easily manipulated and explained away. If federal funding for job training is to continue, rigorous control group studies of these programs must be required.
<p>
	One thing is clear from the few studies that have been done:  Government can do little, if anything, to alter the effect of neglecting the first 12 years of school.
<p>
	The billions of dollars spent on government job training and public assistance programs are too much, too late. What is needed are fundamental changes aimed at reducing illegitimacy and encouraging individuals to complete high school. In addition, parents need to make their children stay in school, do their homework, stay out of trouble, and graduate from high school. Welfare reform that focuses on these goals will reduce the demand for expensive government job training programs that do not work.
<p>
<b>Endnotes:</b>
<ol>
<li>Job placement assistance may speed up the transition from welfare to work and increase the number of hours worked per year, but that is entirely different from the primary purpose of training: better-paying jobs.
<li>The job training block grant in the Work Opportunity Act of 1995 (S. 1120) improves state accountability by requiring performance measures on the employment outcome of program participants, but it does not require control group evaluation studies.<li>The only method for evaluating job training programs effectively is to conduct an experimental design study that randomly assigns individuals either to a treatment group that can receive services from the program under study or to a control group that cannot, and then evaluate the outcomes.

<title>Abolish The Department of Commerce -- Heritage </title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center><h3><i>Abolish the Department of  Commerce: <br>
Move the Undersecretary for International Trade to the Treasury Department</h3></i>
By Joe Cobb<br>
John M. Olin Senior Fellow in Economics<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum #425<br>
August 14, 1995<br>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%><p> </center>
	The legislation in Congress to dismantle the Department of Commerce (DOC) has raised concerns about how necessary functions currently performed by the department will be preserved. Business leaders in particular have expressed concern about protecting U.S. interests in international trade. Although the idea of creating a new Cabinet-level Department of International Trade is gaining momentum, it would not reduce the size of the Cabinet. Responding to the concerns of the business community about U.S. trade policy need not conflict with the initial goal of dismantling Cabinet agencies and reducing the size and scope of government. A more effective solution is to transfer international trade functions to the Treasury Department.
<p>
	<b>Re-examine the Initial Proposal.</b> Section 204 of the Department of Commerce Dismantling Act transfers international trade functions of the Department of Commerce to the United States Trade Representative (USTR). The USTR is an extremely effective agency within the Executive Office of the President, with fewer than 170 employees. It conducts all trade negotiations and represents the United States in the World Trade Organization. A major reorganization of the USTR would be required to place more than 2,500 Commerce Department employees there. The USTR's mission would change dramatically from trade policy negotiation, closely linked to the President's role as a world economic leader, to enforcement of U.S. trade laws and promotion of exports.
<p>
	The prospect of such a major change in the USTR has revived interest in a proposal introduced in previous years to create a Cabinet-level Department of International Trade. Representative John L. Mica (R-FL) has introduced legislation to establish a new U.S. Trade Administration, headed by a "U.S. Trade Representative" but actually performing the functions of a Cabinet department. The current role performed by the USTR would be performed by a Deputy USTR for Negotiations within the new department. Representative Mica argues that "a new cabinet department" is not being established because the current USTR already enjoys "cabinet status."  But moving the USTR out of the Executive Office of the President into a new agency, like the corresponding demotion to "deputy" status of the actual negotiators of trade agreements, suggests the contrary.
<p>
	Creating a new Cabinet-level department to replace the USTR is not only contrary to the intent of Congress in the budget resolution, but also would change completely the USTR's function in American trade policy. The President's trade negotiator has always worked directly with the highest ranking officers of other governments and has been most effective as the personal envoy of the head of state. In recent years, direct meetings between heads of state have played an increasing role in international economic relations. The Executive Office of the President requires a negotiation team like the USTR. Insulating trade policy development from the subsequent administration of trade agreements and other political concerns gives the USTR a necessary flexibility in resolving disputes with foreign governments that is quite different from the routine administrative methods of government bureaucracies.
<p>
	<b>Create an Undersecretary of the Treasury for International Trade.</b> Congress should transfer Department of Commerce trade policy and trade law enforcement activities to the Treasury Department. An Undersecretary of the Treasury for International Trade should be created to assume all functions of the present Undersecretary of Commerce for International Trade. The new Treasury Undersecretary would have the same relative status within a Cabinet department, and the trade functions would complement and reinforce the Treasury Department's current role as the principal agency for international economic policy. There should be no change in the duties of the current Undersecretary of the Treasury for International Affairs.
<p>
	The Secretary of the Treasury is the government's principal officer for international economic policy. The Treasury Department now has exclusive jurisdiction over all U.S. international economic relations, except trade policy, so the Secretary of Commerce is perceived abroad as a minor Cabinet officer. Except for the President, the Treasury Secretary has always been the chief spokesman for U.S. economic interests internationally. The more central role assumed by trade policy in the post-Cold War era requires greater coordination with other international economic functions -- a magnification of influence that only a Treasury Secretary can bring.
<p>
	To elevate the importance of enforcing U.S. international trade agreements -- which is a central concern of both U.S. exporters and domestic industries -- the Secretary of the Treasury should be given clear authority for all international economic functions. The Treasury Department is currently responsible for all enforcement relating to taxation of transnational corporations, which has important trade-related consequences. The Customs Service, within Treasury, is the enforcement agency for any trade regulations issued by the Commerce Department. As international trade grows, an increasing share consists of intermediate products and semifinished goods. This raises questions concerning the correct invoicing of these imports and exports both for determining taxable U.S. income and for accurately measuring the value of trade. The growing problem of fraudulent invoicing of traded goods affects taxation, balance of payments, and money laundering violations -- all of which are Treasury Department concerns.
<p>
	Any new trade agency outside the Treasury Department would fail to carry the authority that trade policy requires. It would remain a minor voice in the Cabinet. As a part of the Treasury Department, international trade issues would have the same relative status within a Cabinet department as they now enjoy, but an Undersecretary in the principal agency for international economic policy would have more influence in the administration.
<p>
	<b>Improve the Administration of U.S. Trade Policy.</b> During the Carter Administration, Congress transferred responsibility for trade policy from the Treasury Department to a new International Trade Administration in Commerce because the Secretary of the Treasury had not corrected a number of problems. Most important, the Department failed to define and delegate responsibilities for administering U.S. trade laws effectively. The Treasury Department was unenthusiastic about enforcing textile and steel quotas, to the dismay of those industries and their supporters in Congress. The 1994 GATT Uruguay Agreement on textile quotas and other non-tariff trade barriers has removed those concerns. Today, a transfer -- without substantial reorganization -- of the position of Undersecretary of International Trade to the Treasury Department would protect and enhance U.S. interests in international trade by preserving a clear line of authority for administering U.S. trade laws and giving it more prominent Cabinet status.
<P>
	<B>What Congress Should Do.</B> Export and import concerns should continue to occupy a priority position in the President's Cabinet, and the role of the USTR should not be diminished by any administrative reorganization. Congress should reject any proposals to create a new Cabinet-level international trade department. It would remain a minor voice in the Cabinet and would not carry the same authority internationally as the Treasury Department. The American people would see through the "shell game" nature of any such exercise and question the commitment of Congress to reducing the size of government. The Clinton Administration would be handed a strong argument for vetoing the entire reorganization proposal. Establishing a new Undersecretary of the Treasury for International Trade responsible for all current functions of the Commerce Undersecretary would address these problems and strengthen the administration of U.S. trade policy.

<title>How to Close Down the Department of Transportation -- Heritage </title>
<center>
<h2>HOW TO CLOSE DOWN<br>
THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION</h2>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/utt.html">Ronald D. Utt, Ph.D.</a>, Visiting Fellow, The Heritage Foundation<br>
Wendell Cox, Director of State Policy and Legislation, American Legislative Exchange Council<br>
Backgrounder #1048<br>
August 17, 1995
<hr size = 3 width = 30%>
<p></center>
INTRODUCTION<b> 1</b>
<p>
The U.S Department of Transportation (DOT) was created in 1966 by consolidating several independent agencies devoted to specific transportation sectors, chiefly the Federal Highway Administration and Federal Aviation Administration, into a new Cabinet-level department. Also included in the new department were several transportation-related divisions from other departments, such as the Coast Guard (which had been at the Department of Commerce), together with newly established federal responsibilities for mass transit under the Urban Mass Transit Act of 1964. In 1970, DOT added interstate passenger rail service to its duties when it took over money-losing passenger routes from private railroads and reorganized them as money-losing Amtrak. Several years later, for a brief period, the department was home to Conrail, a collection of bankrupt rail freight lines in the Northeast, which soon became one of the few federal privatization successes.
<p>
For this fiscal year, federal spending on transportation is budgeted at just over $39 billion. Nearly half -- $19 billion -- will be spent on highways, while roughly 25 percent -- $10 billion -- will be spent on aviation, primarily air traffic control operations and airport grants. Much of the department's spending is derived from the Highway Trust Fund, which is replenished by the federal fuel tax that every consumer pays when he fills up his tank, and the Aviation Trust Fund, financed largely by a passenger ticket tax and several lesser aviation user taxes.
<p>
Largely unchanged in structure and purpose since its creation in 1966, DOT has been the object of a number of recent reform proposals, including a recommendation by the Clinton Administration's National Performance Review that it be overhauled. Several of these proposed reforms, such as "corporatization" of the air traffic control system and consolidation of many surface transportation programs into infrastructure block grants that would be provided to the states, were part of the FY 1996 federal budget. At the same time, the Administration proposed to reduce slightly the amount of money the federal government spends on transportation over the next several years. 
<p>
These relatively modest reforms met with considerable opposition even among House Republicans, who wanted to maintain much of the nearly $40 billion the federal government spends on transportation each year. Fortunately, Senate Republicans have been more committed to fundamental reform, and this was represented in the House/Senate conference agreement on the FY 1996 budget resolution. Though somewhat vague on critical points, the conference report did commit Congress to downsizing and streamlining DOT, and even recommended privatization of the air traffic control system -- in contrast to the House Republicans' initial proposal to keep it as a government bureaucracy. The report, noting that the nation's infrastructure needs are not being met by the current centralized command structure, also urged greater privatization and federalism.
<p>
Specifically, the conference report proposes to phase out Amtrak, which will be cut by $205 million from last year, and mass transit operating subsidies, which will be cut by $300 million. Other areas of transportation, however, receive substantial increases. Spending on highways would rise a staggering $880 million over last year, while $660 million will be provided to start 30 new transit systems, most of which will be in light rail, the least cost-effective of the options available to Americans. This reflects a $19 million increase over last year's new start spending, and is significantly more than President Clinton recommended in proposing only 12 new transit starts in his 1996 budget.
<p>
This reluctance to impose fiscal discipline is troubling. Even worse is the record the House is compiling in attempting to reform the restrictive labor practices past Congresses have forced on Amtrak and local transit systems, as well as Davis-Bacon Act provisions affecting highways. In July, efforts to reform costly labor practices and mandates on mass transit and Amtrak were defeated overwhelmingly as many House Republicans joined with Democrats to vote down every reform proposal put forward as part of the transportation appropriations bill.
<p>
Although too modest in scope, the Clinton Administration's proposals could help reinvigorate the process of fundamental transportation reform that began with President Carter and carried over into the early Reagan Administration, and the House/Senate conference report at least includes general endorsements of reform, decentralization, and privatization. The Administration's proposals implicitly recognize that DOT's duties are largely commercial in nature and might better be left to the states or to the private sector. In the past, the federal government often helped facilitate the more rapid commercialization of a new technology (aviation) or a new concept (limited-access interstate highways). Generally, however, the Department has simply preserved, at considerable taxpayer expense, such inefficient transportation concepts as urban mass transit monopolies or poorly managed interstate passenger rail service. Despite its early successes in highways and aviation, federal involvement in these areas has become costly, bureaucratic, and inflexible, operating in a fashion that preserves the privileges of businesses, civil servants, congressional committees, and unions that benefit financially from the status quo.
<p>
It is time for Congress to recognize that continued federal involvement in transportation is an inefficient use of society's scarce resources. To decrease the costs and decentralize the management of America's transportation system, the Department of Transportation should be closed down, and most of today's federal transportation responsibilities should be returned to individual states, local communities, or the private sector. Such actions would have the effect of continuing the successful transportation policies of the late Carter Administration and early Reagan Administration, when airlines, interstate rail freight, trucking, and the moving industry were deregulated to the considerable benefit of America's consumers, workers, and businesses.
<p>
Specifically, Congress needs to institute major reforms in several areas of transportation policy:
<p>
<b>Surface Transportation</b><br> 
Congress should return to the states much of the responsibility, with the necessary resources, to operate and fund those transportation functions that are the province of government. Most transportation concerns are local in nature, and continuing to force politically influenced, centralized solutions on local problems will be no more successful in the future than it has been in the past.
<p>
Today, the federal government determines how much will be spent on transportation infrastructure, raises the money, and then decides how it will be distributed and divided among the many different forms of transport -- such as highways, mass transit, aviation, and rail passenger services -- in accordance with a central plan developed by the DOT, Congress, and the states and influenced by the many private industries that depend on federal grants and contracts. Costly strings are attached to these funds in the form of dozens of mandates, directives, and special set-asides to satisfy certain constituencies. 
<p>
Congress can reverse this process in 1997 when the legislation authorizing the DOT's largest program -- the Highway Trust Fund -- and the taxes that support it expires. Funded with an 11.5 cent share of the 18.4 cent per gallon federal gas tax, the trust fund each year takes in and disburses approximately $20 billion on highways, bridges, and mass transit initiatives. The program should be allowed to expire as scheduled so the states can assume this relinquished taxing authority to fund their own transportation programs. As an interim step, all the money collected by the federal government through the fuel tax should be returned to the states as a transportation block grant in exact proportion to the amount collected in each state. The accumulated balance in the trust fund, now approaching $18 billion, should be returned to the states in proportion to the amount paid in once the federal budget reaches balance, as scheduled, in the year 2002.
<p>
This block grant would be unrestricted except for a requirement that it be used for transportation, with each state free to distribute the funds among a variety of transportation purposes that best suit its needs. For states needing rail passenger service, a portion of the funds could be used to maintain some or all of the lines that formerly were part of Amtrak. For heavily urbanized states, funds could support mass transit beyond revenues generated by fares. And for most states, most of the money would continue to support highway and bridge programs. After 1997, when the federal fuel tax author-ity expires, states could assume responsibility for the tax <b>2</b> or could develop other funding mechanisms, including taxes, user fees, greater private investor participation, and tolls, to maintain and sustain their own transportation program.
<p>
<b>The End of Mandates</b><br> 
Also terminated should be the large and costly collection of federal mandates, regulations, and prohibitions that have inflated state transportation costs and deterred the development of creative, low-cost transportation solutions. Mandates associated with federal highway funds force states to incur additional costs that may equal as much as 80 percent of the federal funds received. For the federal transit programs, the costs of fulfilling federal mandates can be two to three times the value of the federal subsidy. Ending these mandates would increase substantially the buying power of a transportation block grant, and eliminating the many federal restrictions discouraging states from forming partnerships with private investors to develop or rehabilitate highways and bridges would allow states open access to substantial pools of private development capital. 
<p>
<b>Urban Mass Transit</b><br> 
The most important action Congress can take to reform surface transportation is to terminate the Federal Transit Administration, the most wasteful and counterproductive of all DOT programs. Federal spending on local transit initiatives runs in excess of $4 billion per year, part of which is financed from the 1.5 cent share of the federal fuel tax. Urban and community transit programs are almost entirely local in nature, have few (if any) national ramifications, and derive only about five percent of their operating funds from the federal government. But because of federal mandates, including costly provisions that directly benefit organized labor, the hidden cost to the community may be two to three times higher than the value of the subsidy itself. Thus, all existing federal transit legislation also should be amended to remove all federally imposed mandates and restrictive labor practices. Once the program is terminated and the laws amended, states would be free to fund mass transit programs through the proposed transportation block grant.
<p>
<b>Amtrak</b><br> 
As part of a comprehensive reform of DOT surface transportation programs, all federal funding to Amtrak should end and Amtrak's management should be encouraged to work with interested and affected states to develop creative ways to maintain cost-efficient service. States could use a portion of the new transportation block grant to maintain some local or regional rail service in cooperation with other states and Amtrak, or its successor entity. To this end, the Rail Passenger Service Act of 1970 should be amended to eliminate excessive labor protections and Amtrak's federally enforced monopoly status. In addition, an eight-state compact to maintain and fund operations in the Northeast Corridor should be pre-approved by Congress and the formal transfer of assets (rolling stock, road bed, stations) to the new consortium included in the legislation terminating Amtrak. Popular long-haul routes should be privatized separately to take better advantage of their tourism potential. 
<p>
<b>Aviation</b><br> 
DOT aviation programs, operated by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and financed largely from the airport trust fund, should be privatized (in the case of air traffic control) or fully devolved to the states (airports). Aviation safety responsibilities should remain with the federal government in a new transportation safety agency. Specifically, and similar to proposals of the Senate Budget Committee, the National Performance Review, and the Clinton Administration, the FAA should be split into three parts. The air traffic control system should be reorganized as an independent government corporation, funded by direct user fees, and ultimately privatized; the airport improvement program, and the taxes and fees that fund it, should be turned over to the states and localities. Meanwhile, the safety, licensing, inspection and training functions of the FAA should be carried out either by an independent federal aviation safety agency or by a new government agency that also deals with safety issues related to highways, boats, rail, and other forms of transportation.
<p>
As part of this change, the airport trust fund, with a balance now in excess of $12 billion, should be dissolved and the federal passenger ticket tax ended. A portion of the balance could be used to fund some of the potentially high transition costs involved in privatizing the air traffic control system and to honor existing commitments under the airport improvement program. Once the federal budget is balanced, the remaining funds could be returned to existing airport authorities in proportion to ticket taxes previously collected.
<p>
Existing federal laws, mandates, and prohibitions governing airports should be amended or eliminated to allow greater freedom for airport managers and more private sector participation in airport ownership, construction, development, and management. With these mandates ended, airports would be free to establish their own charges, fees, or taxes on aircraft or passengers in order to fund ongoing operations and improvements.
<p>
<b>The Coast Guard</b><br> 
The Coast Guard's chief responsibilities now focus largely on law enforcement. Congress therefore should transfer the Coast Guard and its coastal security and interdiction functions to the Department of Justice, so that its activities can be coordinated more effectively with those of other federal law enforcement agencies. Other, less pressing duties could be shifted to the private sector, the states, or other agencies. Basic rescue responsibilities, for example, could be turned over to existing private competitors and volunteer organizations, with government retaining responsibility only in the event of extreme emergencies and severe weather conditions beyond the scope and resources of the private sector. Boat safety responsibilities should devolve to the states, where most other transport safety issues already are lodged. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) should take over the Coast Guard's anti-pollution responsibilities, and states or regional authorities should assume responsibility for maintaining navigational aids, policing waterways, and icebreaking.
<p>
The Maritime Administration should be terminated except for its international regulatory roles, which should be transferred to the Department of State or the U.S. Trade Representative. Safety functions and responsibilities should be retained in an independent federal agency. The Maritime Administration and Congress's long, counterproductive interference with the ocean shipping industry have succeeded only in destroying America's once proud maritime heritage. The price, in addition to considerable taxpayer expense, has been the loss of thousands of jobs.
<p>
<br>
<b>FEDERAL HIGHWAY PROGRAM</b><br>
Today's federal highway programs began with Franklin D. Roosevelt's 1944 Federal Highway Aid Act which earmarked $1.6 billion for highways over three years, and Dwight D. Eisenhower's Federal Highway Aid Act of 1956. The former created the federal responsibility; the latter shaped the program that exists today. Specifically, the 1956 Act called for completion of a 41,000-mile interstate highway system by 1972 and created the Highway Trust Fund, financed by a federal excise tax on gasoline, as a long-term source of federal funds for road construction. 
<p>
Congress originally intended the highway program to be a federally assisted state program.<b>3</b> But over time, as more and more federal mandates and money have been added, it has become a state-assisted federal program. A $30 billion program with a fifteen-year projected time for completion has incurred costs of more than $300 billion and is now thirty years behind schedule.
<p>
Although the broad objectives of federal involvement have been met, the federal highway program, operating out of Washington as a centrally managed monopoly incorporating the ideas and transportation concepts of the 1950s, is no longer what America needs. It also is no longer consistent with the original intent of a federally funded state program. With the national highway system largely completed, and with existing and emerging surface transportation issues predominantly local or regional in nature, a centralized, one-size-fits-all program makes little fiscal, management, or creative sense.
<p>
<b>Unresponsive and Bureaucratic.</b> The principal weakness in the current federal system is its centralized allocation of financial resources according to mechanical formulas based more on political influence than on transportation needs. Money collected at the state level from individual drivers whenever they fill their gas tanks is funneled to Washington, where a little less than two-thirds is deposited in the Highway Trust Fund for reallocation back to the states for a variety of federally determined purposes in federally determined proportions. 
<p>
Of the 18.4 cents per gallon now paid at the pump in federal excise taxes, only 10 cents goes to highways. Of the remainder, 1.5 cents goes to mass transit, 0.1 cents to cleaning up leaking storage tanks, and 6.8 cents to the government generally. On October 1, 1995, the highway dedication will rise by 20 percent to 12 cents per gallon and the transit dedication will rise by one-third to 2 cents per gallon. These increases will be financed by reducing the 6.8 cent highway tax support for general government (no overall tax increase will occur).<b>4</b> Similar diversions of tax funding from deficit reduction to highways and mass transit will occur at the same time with respect to other motor fuel taxes.
<p>
How much money each state receives from the fund is determined according to an elaborate mechanical formula which has left a trail of winners and losers. Since its inception in 1956, states such as Alaska and Hawaii, along with the District of Columbia, have received in grants substantially more than they have paid into the fund, while states such as South Carolina, Texas, and Wisconsin have received just over half the amount they have paid in fuel taxes.<b>5</b>
<p>
Once the aggregate allocation is determined, the money returned to the states is earmarked for specific types of projects as determined jointly by members and staff of key congressional committees and staff and officials of the U.S. Department of Transportation. In the 1995 budget, developed in cooperation with President Clinton and the 103rd Congress, $20.1 billion in federal highway aid was allocated in specific amounts to such programs as the national highway system, the surface transportation program, the bridge program, interstate completion, interstate maintenance, interstate substitutions, congestion mitigation and air quality improvement, intelligent vehicle highway systems, emergency relief, federal lands, administration and research (more than $700 million), demonstration projects, high priority corridors, highway-related safety grants, motor carrier safety grants, and miscellaneous appropriations of a quarter of a billion dollars for 80 specific highway projects mandated by Members of Congress for their states or districts.<b>6</b>
<p>
In addition to the predetermined allocations among the states and between specific types of highway projects, Washington determines how much and what types of urban mass transit assistance each state receives, how much passenger rail service is available to it and at what cost, and how much money will be provided for airport construction, improvement, and modernization.
<p>
<b>Miles of Red Tape.</b> In order to receive these predetermined funding allocations, states and local communities must agree to adhere to a growing list of mandates that substantially raise the cost of meeting transportation needs, thereby actually diminishing the amount of transport services that each federal dollar can buy. Chief among these counterproductive mandates are:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Construction Wage Laws. The Davis-Bacon Act of 1932 requires that any project receiving federal funds must pay workers the area's "prevailing wage" as determined by the U.S. Department of Labor. In most cases, this means above-market union wages and adds an estimated 20 percent to 30 percent to the cost of affected projects.<b>7</b>
<p>
<li>Environmental Regulations. Threatening to withhold federal highway funds is one way the Environmental Protection Agency, in cooperation with the DOT, frequently forces states to apply a variety of environmental regulations to car drivers. As a result of these threats and mandates, for example, drivers in certain areas of the country must undergo costly mandatory emissions inspections and switch seasonally to more costly and less efficient oxygenated fuels to reduce carbon monoxide emissions and photo-chemical smog to national standards established by the EPA. 
<p>
These substantial costs are forced on automobile owners despite the absence of conclusive epidemiological evidence that these emissions adversely affect human health. And while the health and environmental benefits of these and other regulations are uncertain and questionable, the financial benefits of the oxygenated fuels mandate to the ethanol industry are both substantial and obvious. In addition to these restrictions, new highway construction projects must be preceded by costly and time-consuming environmental impact statements.
<p>
<li>Safety Regulations. Similar threats have been used to require states to enforce costly safety initiatives, such as the recently repealed, federally mandated 55-mile-per-hour speed limit that added to costs, inconvenience, and congestion on the highways while making only a negligible contribution to decreased deaths, injuries, and property damage.<b>8</b> Such regulations have been wholly inappropriate and counterproductive to states, and regions within states, characterized by low population densities, as well as to regions where long-distance driving often is essential for employment and other day-to-day tasks.
<p>
<li>Miscellaneous Regulations and Mandates. Other federal requirements and mandates linked to federal highway funds include driver's license screening procedures for controlled substances, safety belt enforcement, drug-free workplace requirements, creating and maintaining a problem driver point system, commercial motor vehicle safety provisions, enforcement of the Truth in Mileage Act, requirements for minority business enterprise and women's business enterprise contracting, implementation of sound abatement barriers, bicycle paths and right of ways, metric conversion, establishment of an information data base system, hazardous waste operations, emergency response training programs, treatment of storm water runoff, compliance with the Fair Labor Standards Act as it relates to recipients of federal grants, and utilization of pulverized, recycled rubber in highway paving and repaving materials. A recent study of the cost of highway-related federal mandates imposed on California concluded that California incurred expenses of $1.8 billion to fulfill these mandates so it could receive $2.3 billion in federal highway money. <b>9</b>
</ul>
<p>
<b>The Need to End Federal Limits and Prohibitions on Tolls and Private Investor Participation.</b> Among the most damaging federal requirements are the limits on the extent to which states can charge tolls and work in partnership with private-sector investors. Highways funded in whole or in part by the Highway Trust Fund may neither charge any tolls (except for a small number of Washington-approved demonstration projects) nor be developed or renovated with private investor participation. Thus, an opportunity to add significantly to the funds available for highway construction -- at no cost to the taxpayer -- is foregone, and America's ability to meet its transportation needs is held hostage to federal funding limits and allocations established by Congress and DOT staff. For example, an estimated 230,000 highway bridges need significant repair at a projected cost of $60 billion or more.<b>10</b> In this year's budget, the Clinton Administration requested just $2.6 billion in FY 1996 for bridges under the Federal Aid to Highways program, or just less than 5 percent of the estimated need.<b>11</b>
<p>
In addition to the unnecessary limits on resources that it creates, the prohibition on tolls precludes opportunities to contribute, however modestly, to the alleviation of congestion and the better utilization of existing transportation resources through market pricing mechanisms. For example, the major surface transportation issue in communities throughout the country is congestion, generally associated with commuting and rush hour travel. With existing highways offered to consumers (drivers) as a "free good," or at least as a pre-paid service, drivers have no financial incentive to alter their schedules or their mode of transportation so they might use this valuable asset more efficiently to minimize congestion. To induce drivers to alter their travel plans to diminish congestion during peak travel periods associated either with holidays or workday rush hours, tolls could be levied (or increased where they already exist) on specific bridges or highways, as appropriate. This would encourage some individuals to defer travel, to utilize an alternative mode of transportation such as public transit or car pools, or take a different route.
<p>
Such congestion pricing tolls have been implemented in several cities in Europe and Asia (for instance, Bergen, Oslo, and Singapore), and public transit systems in Washington, D.C., and several other U.S. cities charge a premium for rush hour travel on buses and subways to encourage riders to shift travel to off-peak times. Although by no means a panacea, there is no reason why this concept could not be applied selectively to auto travel in the United States in those places and along those routes where existing traffic patterns make it possible and where driving patterns may be sensitive to price incentives. Unfortunately, federal prohibitions and habit deter its use, so efforts are limited to public exhortations urging citizens to ride buses or join car pools. 
<p>
Until recently, placing tolls on congested urban roads and bridges was not always economically practical because the collection costs and ensuing delays would likely have worsened the situation. However, new technologies allow electronic assessment of tolls from moving cars and trucks, using inexpensive transponders or receivers mounted on the vehicles. In the United States such automated systems have been implemented on the Crescent City Connection 12-lane bridge in New Orleans, the 17-mile North Dallas Tollway,<b>12</b> and the Oklahoma toll road system.
<p>
Allowing for tolls creates opportunities for the private sector to develop and operate highways or to participate as partners with government in highway construction and operation. While private toll roads are common in Western Europe, and several are under construction (or planned) in several places in the U.S., their use has been limited severely by prohibitions and constraints at both the state and federal levels. Many states simply prohibit privately owned highways, while others tightly regulate them and require an elaborate and costly approval process. At the federal level, while there are no outright prohibitions on private highways, there have been tight controls on the extent to which private and public moneys can be commingled in infrastructure investments developed on a for-profit basis, and these controls have largely discouraged any private interest.<b>13</b>
<p>
At the same time, ambiguities regarding ownership of existing federally supported public roads, as well as federal anti-toll provisions, deter the creation of for-profit public/private partnerships that could rehabilitate, modernize, or widen -- at little or no taxpayer expense -- an existing public road that once received federal funding for some or all of its construction. Until very recently, there was no formal legal mechanism to allow for the sale or disposal of such highways, or to assess properly a reimbursement payment to offset the past federal investment. As a consequence, previously built highways in need of rehabilitation, modernization, and widening must wait their turn and compete politically with other highway projects for federal grant money. In recent years, executive orders promulgated by both the Bush and the Clinton Administrations have resolved some, but not all, of these problems. 
<p>
Private-sector participation would allow some highway rehabilitation projects (particularly for well-traveled highways with restricted access) to receive immediate attention and financing at no cost to the taxpayer. A partnership could be formed between the state or local community and private investors, who would provide the funds to widen and resurface the aging highway to current standards and needs and be compensated for the effort, risk, and investment by receiving a portion of the tolls collected on the highway. The community's transportation needs would be addressed sooner and for less money (thanks in part to no federal red tape, which adds at least 20 percent to 30 percent to highway costs). Meanwhile, those who benefit the most -- the drivers who use the new road -- would pay for it in direct proportion to usage and benefits received.
<p>
Private highway projects currently are under construction in Virginia and California, and others are planned for Minnesota and Washington State. Private toll roads have long been in operation in France, Germany, and Italy and are underway in Argentina, Chile, China, Great Britain, Hong Kong, and Mexico.<b>14</b>
<p>
Although toll roads, including hundreds built and operated by private companies, played an important role in the early development of America's transportation infrastructure, the growing federalization of the highway system over the past forty years has discouraged and formally prohibited both private sector participation and the use of tolls on public roads. The rationale for this prohibition is thin and merits brief discussion. 
<p>
<b>Haven't We already Paid For It?</b> The chief argument used against tolls and highway privatization is that drivers already have paid for the highway through the federal fuel tax and Highway Trust Fund, which roughly relates taxes paid to highway usage. Under these circumstances, it is argued, any additional levies or user fees would be unfair and redundant. But this exaggerates the extent to which fuel taxes paid by individuals actually fund the highways, as well as the correspondence between costs incurred and benefits received. Further, it vastly overstates the ability of the user fee, as currently configured, to finance the U.S. highway and bridge system to the desired level of quality and capability.
<p>
A principal complaint about the existing user fee system is that less than 55 percent of the tax goes to highways, suggesting that any reference to the gas tax as a user fee is misleading. Further distorting the relationship between fees paid and benefits received is the fact that a disproportionate share of federal highway money goes to just 22 percent of U.S. road miles, which includes the interstate highway system and, to a lesser extent, its arterials and collectors. It does not include local roads, however, so auto owners whose driving is primarily local pay the federal fuel tax without receiving much in the way of direct benefits. 
<p>
In a similar vein, drivers who pay to use existing toll roads, such as the New Jersey and the Pennsylvania Turnpikes or Interstate 95 between Baltimore, Maryland, and Wilmington, Delaware, also pay the gas tax, yet are not eligible for a rebate due to double taxation. Indeed, the price of fuel sold on these toll roads includes the federal fuel tax. Also distorting the relationship between fees and benefits is the fact that while different types of vehicles impose significantly different costs on highways, these differences are not reflected properly in the fees they pay. Heavy trucks, for example, cause substantially more wear and tear than is covered by the various fees and taxes they pay.<b>15</b>
<p>
Thus, it is not true that bridge and highway tolls are unfair because they would distort the relationship between fees and usage. The addition of more road and bridge tolls dedicated exclusively to highway improvement actually would enhance the correspondence between what drivers pay and what they in turn receive.
<p>

<b>What Congress Should Do</b>
<p>
<li><b>Do not reauthorize the federal highway and transit program.</b>
<p> 
Federal motor fuel taxes should be allowed to expire as scheduled.<b>16</b> This would constitute complete and final devolution of the program to the states, which would finance their highway, transit, and leaking underground storage tank needs as they see fit (probably by increasing state motor fuels taxes or substituting a state fuel tax for the terminated federal fuel tax).
<p>
Abolish the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) (49 USC app. 1651 note).
<p>
<li><b>Devolve the federal highway program to the states.</b> 
<p>
This would require repeal of Title 23 of the U.S. Code, with the exception of Sections 204, 205, 210, 212, 215, 216, and 218, and would comport with the original intent of the law that the federal highway program be a state program. Full devolution to the states is appropriate, since local governments are units of state government. Research programs would be financed by the states and by private-sector interests in the highway industry. 
<p>
Devolving the program would involve several actions:
<ul>
<p>
<li>Before the scheduled re-authorization, all federal motor fuel taxes dedicated to the Highway Trust Fund and the Leaking Underground Storage Trust Fund should be returned to the states as a transportation block grant in proportion to their collection. 
<li>All federal mandates (funded, underfunded, and unfunded) should be removed. This could be accomplished by simple legislative language such as the following:<b>17</b> "Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, states shall have the right to waive any federal requirement in Title 23 and Title 49 Section 1601 et seq." 
<li>The returned funds should be subject to conventional state legislative and administrative procedures.<b>18</b>
<li>Return the balance in the Highway Trust Fund to the states from federal budget surpluses earned after the federal budget is balanced.<b>19</b>
<li>Disbursements should be based on a formula that reasonably approximates prior state contributions to the Highway Trust Fund.
</ul>
<p>
<li>Establish an Office of Interstate Highway Cooperation.
<p>
This office could be created either as an independent agency or within a successor entity that absorbed remaining responsibilities of terminated or consolidated agencies. It would bring together state officials to deal with issues of coordination among the states (such as designation of interstate and USC highway numbers). Minimal funding would be required.
<p>
<li>Transfer International Programs to the Department of State (23 USC 212, 216, and 218).
<p>
Included in DOT are numerous transportation responsibilities with international ramifications, such as landing rights for air carriers, limits on fares, negotiated shipping rates, and safety issues. These matters could be handled better by the Department of State in coordination with other diplomatic issues.
<p>
<li>Transfer the Federal Lands Highway Program, forest development roads and trails highways, and territorial highway program to the Department of the Interior or its successor agency (49 USC 204, 205, and 215).
<p>
<li>Transfer defense access roads to the Department of Defense (49 USC 210).
<p>
<li>Terminate separate highway programs of the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) and consolidate these responsibilities into the proposed transportation block grant.
<p>
<br>
<b>HIGHWAY SAFETY PROGRAMS</b>
<p>
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is responsible for regulatory and other programs involving highway and vehicle safety. In addition, the Office of Motor Carriers deals with safety issues associated with interstate bus and truck transportation, and the Office of Research and Special Programs includes or oversees several other related efforts including Hazardous Materials Safety, Pipeline Safety, the Transportation Safety Institute, and university research programs. 
<p>
All of these programs should be reviewed for effectiveness or redundancy and to determine whether they are more properly the province of the states. Once reviewed and restructured, the remaining federal safety responsibilities should be transferred to a newly created independent federal entity  an Interstate Transportation Safety Office (or Administration) -- which includes all the other transportation safety responsibilities now within DOT, such as those of the Federal Aviation Administration and the Maritime Administration. 
<p>
As part of this review, Congress should consider creating national maximum vehicle safety standards to discourage states from imposing more restrictive regulations that impede interstate commerce and add unnecessarily to costs. A possible precedent for such federal maximum standards is the standards promulgated and enforced by the Department of Housing and Urban Development for the manufactured housing industry. Again, however, highway safety programs are more legitimately the province of the states.
<p>
<br>
<b>What Congress Should Do</b>
<p>
<li>Abolish the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (23 USC 401).
<p>
<li>Merge vehicle-related interstate safety programs into the proposed Interstate Transportation Safety Office.
<p>
<li>Devolve the remaining non-interstate highway safety programs to the states.
<p>
<li>Merge any critical statistical functions into the Census Bureau or its successor agency.
<p>
<br>
<b>THE FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION</b>
<p>
Created by the Urban Mass Transit Act of 1964 and administered by DOT's Federal Transit Administration, the federal transit program is a costly failure:  Mass transit's market position today is the same as 31 years ago when Congress passed the Act. The program has consistently led to unwise transportation decisions by state and local authorities, encouraged local transit monopolies, and precluded the adoption of cost-effective operating methods and innovative solutions.
<p>
Although funding from the Mass Transit Account of the Highway Trust Fund and other federal revenues provide only a small fraction of the financial resources available to urban mass transit systems, the many regulations and mandates attached to federal funding have had a profoundly adverse influence on local transit policy. Despite the billions of dollars of state, local, and federal money invested in costly transit systems over the past 30 years, annual transit trips per capita have declined by one-third, and barely two percent of person trips today are by transit. In addition, transit's work trip (commuter) market share declined from 1980 to 1990 in 36 of the nation's 39 metropolitan areas with populations of more than one million.<b>20</b>
<p>
<b>Monopolistic Control.</b> Transit's vastly diminished status reflects more than a century of government meddling and government-sanctioned and protected monopolies, whether public or private. Private transit companies and systems emerged in the late 19th century and grew rapidly in response to the growth of the urban population during the industrial revolution. Although private in origin, these rail-based companies quickly became monopolies by obtaining exclusive franchises from local and state governments. As early as the second decade of this century, governments in city after city outlawed jitneys (independently owned and operated buses), eliminating any competitive threat that might confront the private transit monopolists.
<p>
Unfortunately for these transit companies, their government protection from competition was not without its cost. Over the ensuing decades, these private systems were subject to price controls on their fares, mandatory service on designated routes, and mandated frequency of service. At the same time, they became easy prey for organized labor, which could shut down an entire city because all competing systems and companies had been eliminated. Private transit systems had little choice but to accede to exorbitant union wage demands and work rule requirements. These work rules are still in force, but in the public transit sector where federal mandates help maintain organized labor's privileged position in local systems.<b>21</b>
<p>
Local governments could suppress organized business competition to their protected transit franchisees, but they could not suppress the striving of individual commuters for something better. These individuals began to exercise their free will and seek a more convenient and cost-effective solution by driving their cars to work and to market. Subject to heavy government regulation and high labor costs, and thus unable to compete, the private transit monopolists began to face serious financial problems as their customers went elsewhere. With harsh labor contracts precluding cost savings through labor efficiencies, transit companies turned to deferred maintenance, capital acquisition, and reductions in other services. The ensuing deterioration in service further discouraged customers, and revenues continued to decline until the systems went bankrupt. One by one, they were taken over by local governments or multi-jurisdictional transit authorities. Taxpayer-supported public monopolies replaced the private ones that had failed.
<p>
<b>The Federal Takeover.</b> The next step was to get the federal government involved. This occurred in 1964 with the enactment of the Urban Mass Transit Act, which provided for capital grants to fund up to 75 percent of local projects. Section 13(c) of the Act also effectively codified organized labor's privileged position within the transit system by requiring, as a condition of federal aid, that a transit authority sign a U.S. Department of Labor-approved contract with transit unions. Among other things, these mandated agreements generally include provisions requiring a six-year severance payment for transit employees dismissed because of efficiency measures.
<p>
This Act was just one of several pieces of federal legislation during the 1960s that shifted heretofore local responsibilities such as housing, transit, and welfare to the federal government, all with disastrous results. Ten years later, in 1974, the Urban Mass Transit Act was amended to extend federal support to operating subsidies as part of a national energy conservation effort. Today, the federal government spends about $4 billion each year to help subsidize a service that millions of consumers overwhelmingly reject in growing numbers:  Just over five percent of employees now get to work using public transit.
<p>
<b>Impact of Cutting Off Federal Subsidies.</b> Because federal support accounts for only about five percent of transit operating costs, and because existing transit system borrowing capabilities would be sufficient to add more and replace existing capital assets, the termination of all federal subsidies would have little initial negative impact on transit's ability to serve its dwindling customer base. Indeed, encouraging greater self-reliance and removing all of the costly and counterproductive mandates attached to federal grants and subsidies would leave enterprising transit authorities financially better off, because the estimated cost of these mandates is more than two to three times the value of the subsidy.<b>22</b> For FY 1996, the House/Senate conference report on the budget proposes a substantial reduction in federal financial support of transit but stops short of recommending the elimination of the Federal Transit Administration, as proposed originally by the House.
<p>
With the provisions of Section 13(c) eliminated and no longer able to disrupt productive labor-management relations, transit authorities could adopt widely available cost savings opportunities through such practices as competitive contracting and better management of existing workforce. Because of the lack of incentives for properly managing existing personnel, and because of the many restrictive work rules common to its federally approved labor contracts, America's public transit industry has been the only major industry to experience a decline in labor productivity during the 1980s. Over that period, transit's productivity fell a staggering 40 percent compared with an increase in all other transportation sectors, including even Amtrak.<b>23</b>
<p>
The combination of rising wages and falling productivity has had a profoundly adverse effect on transit's cost structure. Unit costs (costs per mile or hour) are often double, or more expensive than market costs for the same services, even when provided by private contractors using union labor. As a result, U.S. transit cost escalation has been greater than that of health care and greater than that of transit systems in other developed nations.<b>24</b>
<p>
As long as the federal government is there to bail them out, transit authorities have no incentive to become more efficient or to adopt management techniques common to other businesses, and local communities and governments, which oversee these transit systems, have no incentive to interfere or to exercise their responsibility on behalf of their constituents and transit's customers. Without the federal cushion and indirect oversight, local governments could restructure their transit systems in ways that serve the customer, not managers and employees and Washington bureaucrats that devise and enforce the regulations and mandates.
<p>
With the federal government no longer providing capital grants that mandate certain types of equipment, transit authorities also would be free to acquire less expensive but more suitable equipment. Moreover, with transit authorities now fully responsible for servicing the debt incurred to acquire the equipment, these capital assets would be better maintained than has been the practice.<b>25</b>
<p>
<b>The Need for Competition.</b> Chief among the necessary reforms is opening the local transit market to competition by eliminating the legal monopoly now held by all transit authorities. Today, anyone offering services in competition with existing public transit is in violation of various criminal and civil statutes. As the limited contracting out done by transit services demonstrates, private-sector providers, often using unionized workers, are able to provide the same service for less money, make a profit, pay taxes, and service the debt on their equipment -- four simple tasks that no public transit service in the country could hope to accomplish.

While the potential cost savings are considerable, the real benefit to consumers from competition is the creativity that it will unleash in devising innovative solutions to traditional problems. In the hands of government monopolies, U.S. transit systems now rely on a combination of solutions and services that have not evolved much beyond those that were developed between 1880 and 1920, except that they cost much more and offer less convenient service. Not surprisingly, modern Americans have little interest in a type of service that was becoming obsolete when their grandparents were coming of age.
<p>
Typical of Congress's fascination with 19th century technologies are the costly light rail systems it has funded in communities across the United States, notwithstanding a pervasive lack of commuter interest. The "new start" rail capital program has financed some of the most costly and ineffective pork-barrel projects in the nation, despite the absence of any evidence from anywhere in the world that urban rail lines reduce traffic congestion. These systems involve sometimes staggering costs. According to one recent report, the congressionally approved Tasman Corridor, a $500 million, 12.4-mile light rail line in California linking Milpitas and Mountain View, will cost $33 for each new rider.<b>26</b>
<p>
A DOT study by Harvard economists indicates that bus-ways can be built and operated for one-fifth the cost of new rail systems.<b>27</b> But rail systems have become a federally financed way to enhance civic pride and accommodate the preferences of hobbyists and rail buffs. Virtually all academic researchers not dependent upon income from the transit industry or the Federal Transit Administration agree that building publicly financed rail transit is indefensible. 
<p>
Even if the cost could be justified, no element of today's local transit programs calls for federal involvement. Transit programs are, by definition, local in scope, and where two or three states are involved in the same system, interstate compacts can be formed to provide region-wide management and help raise the funds needed to maintain the service. Removing the federal government from local transit matters would leave state and local governments free to devise their own solutions, reduce costs by getting rid of federal red tape, and adopt creative solutions from a competitive private sector that stands to profit by serving its customers. 
<p>
Supporters of the status quo argue that there is no money to be made in transit and that the financial failures of government-regulated monopolies in the 1950s and 1960s prove this. What they really prove, of course, is the counterproductive effects of government-sanctioned anti-competitive practices and regulation. Today, scores of profit-making, private transit firms bid eagerly on every government contract offered, and at prices below the level charged by public transit. The only thing that prevents a flood of private buses, vans, and taxis from offering low-cost, for-profit transit services in cities and suburbs is the threat of legal action from government.  
<p>
<br>
<b>What Congress Should Do</b>
<p>
<li>Abolish the Federal Transit Administration.
<p>
<li>Repeal the federal transit program (49 USC Chapter 21).<br> 
States should be free to provide financial support to their transit systems through the transportation block grant proposed in the previous section or through other means.

<br>
<b>THE FEDERAL RAILROAD ADMINISTRATION</b><br>
The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) oversees rail safety, rail subsidies, and rail research. It also administers the Northeast Corridor rail rehabilitation project and owns and administers the Transportation Test Center, staffed by the Association of American Railroads. Only one of these functions -- interstate rail safety -- is an appropriate federal activity. Research should be funded by the railroad industry. 
<p>
<br>
<b>What Congress Should Do</b>
<p>
<li>Abolish the Federal Railroad Administration (49 USC APP. 1652).
<p>
<li>Repeal all FRA functions not involving interstate rail safety.
<p>
<li>Sell the Transportation Test Center to the private sector. 
<p>
<li>Merge rail safety programs into the proposed Office of Interstate Transportation Safety.

<br>
<b>THE NATIONAL RAILROAD PASSENGER CORPORATION (Amtrak)</b><br>
The National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) was created in 1970 to take over the nation's ailing private passenger rail service. Conceived as a two-year federally assisted experiment, Amtrak has managed to survive for 25 years at a cumulative cost to the taxpayer of over $17 billion plus interest. With a fleet of approximately 2,200 cars and engines operating on over 25,000 miles of track, Amtrak carries approximately 22 million passengers a year. 
<p>
President Clinton's budget proposed a subsidy of $750 million for FY 1996 and assumed that Amtrak will adopt substantial reforms to make itself more commercially viable and reduce its reliance on federal operating subsidies. Although the original House Republican proposal was even more generous, the House/Senate budget conference cut more than $200 million from Amtrak. However, efforts to reform operations, particularly onerous labor requirements, failed as many House Republicans voted with the Democrats to preserve the extraordinary privileges in organized labor's Amtrak contract. This failed reform effort illustrates why it is time to terminate the federal subsidy at the end of this fiscal year, giving Amtrak time to develop a strategic plan to achieve financial independence from the taxpayer.
<p>
<b>Amtrak's Marginal Impact on America's Transport Needs.</b> Carrying less than one-half of one percent of America's inter-city passengers, Amtrak has become a costly burden on the taxpayer. Proposed for termination in several budgets during the Reagan Administration, it has been kept alive by Congress, which has provided billions in annual subsidies in return for promises that the corporation would become commercially viable. It never has, and those who believe it will in the future are allowing hope to triumph over experience and good sense. Despite 25 years of reform efforts and promises, the best the government has been able to do is to reduce the annual subsidy from over a billion dollars during the Carter Administration to about half that during the Reagan Presidency. Under Clinton the subsidy has been creeping back up to Jimmy Carter levels of generosity. 
<p>
After years of mismanagement, overly generous labor agreements, and intense competition from airlines and long-haul buses, Amtrak's financial situation has deteriorated, and its prospects for improvement are even more illusory than in the past. In December 1994, as a result of competitive pressures on revenues, higher than expected operating costs, and a serious accident, Amtrak's budget went even deeper into the red, forcing the company to announce a series of major route and service cuts to stay within its existing budget and federal subsidy. Faced with persistent competition from private buses and airlines, Amtrak will continue to struggle with a worsening deficit, in addition to which deferred maintenance, an aging fleet (23 years per car today, compared with 17.5 years in 1989), and rapid depreciation of the Northeast Corridor's roadbed will likely cause operating and essential capital costs to escalate rapidly, requiring even larger taxpayer subsidies.
<p>
Amtrak represents a failed attempt to convert inter-city rail service from a subsidized system to a self-sustaining, profitable system. Amtrak achieves a significant market share only in the Northeast Corridor (Washington-New York-Boston) -- and only with heavy subsidies per rider. In virtually all other markets, eliminating service would have no discernible impact on transportation facilities (highways and airports), because Amtrak's market share is infinitesimal.
<p>
To compensate for the loss of federal financial support, Amtrak's strategic survival plan should include privatization of commercially viable routes; partnerships with other transportation, travel, and recreational entities; or regional public-private partnerships through more aggressive use of the 403(b) provisions of the Rail Passenger Service Act, which allow for greater cost sharing with states and local communities served by Amtrak. In the event that the mid-Atlantic and northeast states served by Amtrak's Northeast Corridor operation find the service of value to their citizens and businesses, they could use some portion of their proposed transportation block grant or state-controlled fuel tax to keep regional Amtrak service in operation. To facilitate this, the DOT should be prepared to conduct an orderly transfer of necessary assets and responsibilities -- chiefly the rolling stock and roadbed -- to the affected states.
<p>
Existing law and practice allow for this, and there is precedent for state takeover of routes abandoned for budgetary purposes. Under the Section 403(b) provisions of the Act, and in response to Amtrak's elimination of several costly and wasteful lines, California will take over daily Amtrak service between San Francisco and Sacramento.
<p>
There is no public purpose to be served by further taxpayer support of Amtrak. Nor is there any practical reason to phase out federal support only gradually, as many in Congress suggest. A careful reading of 25 years of presidential budget proposals and congressional appropriations bills for transportation, shows annual promises by Amtrak to get its house in order. But Amtrak has never delivered on its promises, and never will. This Congress should distinguish itself from its predecessors by being the first not to be fooled by Amtrak's bureaucracy or its powerful unions.
<p>
<br>
<b>The High Speed Rail Program</b><br> 
In addition to subsidizing Amtrak, the DOT subsidizes a costly high speed rail program designed to encourage the development of high speed rail corridors. This program serves no useful purpose because the inter-city transportation market already is served by self-sustaining (profitable) air and surface operators. High speed rail is not commercial in the United States for a variety of reasons, among them the country's relatively low population densities, relatively high access to automobiles, and competitive (deregulated) air transportation market, which is capable of price discounting that renders high speed rail uncompetitive. As a result, a number of privately financed high speed rail proposals have failed, and the federal government is not likely to improve on this record.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do</b>
<p>
<li>Eliminate all Amtrak funding (including operating and capital support, the Northeast Corridor improvement program, and Penn Station). Management should be encouraged to develop creative solutions for survival.
<p>
<li>Repeal the National Railroad Passenger Act and the Rail Passenger Service Act. This, among other things, would terminate Amtrak's statutory monopoly (45 USC 541).
<p>
<li>Pre-authorize, in legislation, an interstate compact among northeastern states and the District of Columbia for the purpose of facilitating Northeast Corridor rail transportation in the event that citizens of these states are willing to subsidize the service.
<p>
<li>Repeal Amtrak's labor protections. Workers today can receive up to six years severance pay and enjoy numerous other protections and privileges because of costly work rules.
<p>
<li>Repeal the high speed rail program (49 USC Chapter 22).
<p>
<br>
<b>THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION</b><br>
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), with an annual budget of $8.4 billion and 49,000 employees, manages the nation's civilian air traffic control system, promotes air transport safety, and assists in the financing of airport improvements. Approximately three-quarters of its personnel are involved directly with the air traffic control system,<b>28</b> composed largely of the operations of airport control towers, which guide aircraft through landings and takeoffs, and twenty en route centers, which manage the flow of air traffic between airports in the system. The FAA has broad responsibility for regulating air transportation and managing the nation's airways, in addition to such safety-related duties as aircraft certification, airport security, maintenance inspection, and pilot licensing.
<p>
The FAA's programs are funded through a combination of general revenues and the Aviation Trust Fund, itself financed by a series of user fees and dedicated taxes related to system usage. In 1995 these user fees and special taxes totaled over $6 billion. They were derived chiefly from the passenger ticket tax ($4,829 million), the waybill tax ($325 million), the fuel tax ($195 million), and interest on the trust fund ($809 million). At the beginning of 1995, the trust fund account had accumulated to $12.3 billion.<b>29</b>
<p>
<br>
<b>The FAA's Air Traffic Control Responsibilities</b><br>
Although the FAA's air traffic control (ATC) system has helped provide the American traveler with one of the safest forms of transportation, shifting the system to the private sector would give it the flexibility and resources needed to speed modernization, enhance operating efficiency, and better manage and retain its many employees. The ATC system's efforts to improve and modernize operations have suffered from the bureaucratic idiosyncrasies of the federal procurement process, the civil service code, and congressional and executive branch meddling. One former FAA Commissioner noted that congressional committees had mandated the installation of thirty pieces of equipment neither authorized by Congress nor requested by the FAA. At the same time, rigid government pay scales have limited the FAA's ability to attract experienced professionals to high-cost, high-stress urban air traffic control facilities.<b>30</b>
<p>
<b>Faster Modernization.</b> The ATC's multi-year, multi-billion-dollar modernization program is a costly failure. As a result, the system remains one of the world's largest users of vacuum tubes, some of which are available only through formerly East Bloc countries.<b>31</b> Freed from oppressive government procurement procedures, a privatized corporation could speed the modernization of the air traffic control system by drawing on private capital. This would reduce costs by raising worker productivity; improving passenger safety through better and more accurate controls; diminishing weather-related cancellations, delays, and safety risks; and allowing more intensive use of existing airports, thereby cutting future infrastructure costs.
<p>
At the same time, automation of the many ATC functions that would be triggered by privatization would quickly turn an existing liability into an asset. Dependent upon the obsolete, high-maintenance, and labor-intensive technologies of the past, today's air traffic control system confronts a serious shortage of skilled personnel as an aging workforce becomes eligible for retirement. With the adoption of advanced technologies that allow a few to do the work of many, and that also require less maintenance, the prospect of significant retirements over the near term would allow for the orderly and costless downsizing of FAA's substantial workforce. 
<p>
<b>Budgetary Savings.</b> Although the ATC system relies heavily on user fees, general revenues still supplement its budget. An internal DOT study in 1994 concluded that converting the FAA's ATC component into a self-sufficient, independent government corporation could lead to savings of $18 billion, or approximately $2 billion per year, from 1996 to 2005.<b>32</b> As a quasi-government entity, this corporatized system would continue to rely on the passenger ticket tax as the chief source of ATC funding, but the general revenues that now fund a portion of FAA/ATC operations would be cut off. To compensate for this loss, the system would be permitted to borrow in capital markets on its own account to fund long-term investments and modernization. The FAA's safety and regulatory functions would remain within the federal government as part of a much smaller FAA, whose role would be largely one of system oversight, a legitimate federal function that would improve in quality as the government concentrated its energies and resources on a limited number of activities. 
<p>
While the Clinton Administration's plan for the ATC system is bold and innovative by past federal reform standards, opportunities for even greater reform exist in today's political climate. These should be pursued, as they are now in other industrialized countries. At present, the air traffic control systems in Canada, Germany, New Zealand, South Africa, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom are corporatizing, privatizing, or actively considering one of these options. 
<p>
To privatize the ATC system, Congress should use as its model the proposal developed by Robert Poole of the Reason Foundation in a series of reports and publications dating back to 1982.<b>33</b>
<p>
<b>Privatizing the ATC System</b><br> 
The first step would be to reorganize the FAA by creating, as an independent government corporation, a U.S. Airways Corporation (USAC) and transfering to it all current ATC-related FAA staff (about 40,000), all FAA facilities and equipment used to operate the ATC system, and all ATC responsibilities now held by the FAA. During the reorganization period, and until the new corporation was established and operating successfully, all of its shares would be held by the U.S. Treasury on behalf of the federal government. Also as part of the reorganization, consideration should be given to creating several new air traffic control companies to ensure post-government competition. Half the towers could go into one, and half to another (the same would be true for the en route centers). Once privatized, they would be free to compete for business.
<p>
After the transition, the shares would be sold to the public, with special allowances for concessionary purchases by existing employees and managers. Within the portion of shares available to the public, a sub-portion could be set aside for purchase by firms and industries heavily dependent upon the USAC's services, such as the major airlines or associations representing general aviation, international aviation, passengers, overnight package delivery, and general cargo. 
<p>
Once established, the USAC would operate on a self-supporting basis and would be authorized to borrow for major capital expenditures, modernization, and other improvements. In contrast to the Clinton Administration's proposal to continue funding a restructured ATC through the existing passenger ticket tax, the private USAC would be funded by a direct user fee levied on the aircraft according to their utilization of the services provided by the system. As Poole has observed, the "daunting challenge facing ATC spin-off proposals is developing a user fee structure that is politically feasible yet fully funds the corporation"<b>34</b> and which also avoids the cross-subsidies inherent in the current system.
<p>
These cross-subsidies are considerable. For example, whereas passenger ticket taxes collected through the airlines account for 88 percent of the current system's revenues, airlines utilize 49 percent of its en route services and just 20 percent of the tower services. In contrast, general aviation provides just three percent of the revenues but accounts for 21 percent of en route costs and 60 percent of tower costs.<b>35</b> At the same time, government flights, chiefly military, utilize some ATC system services, but pay no direct, indirect, or other fees, although the military air traffic controllers provide some services to civilian aircraft, also at no charge.
<p>
In developing a new fee/price structure for the USAC, Poole recommends three general guiding principles:
<p>
<li>No one should pay for services they do not use;
<p>
<li>Non-commercial ("true" general aviation) customers should pay only the marginal costs they impose on the system; and
<p>
<li>Charges should be based upon long-run economic costs. 
<p>
A fourth principle should be added to Poole's list, based on prevailing views within Congress:
<p>
<li>Military (government) flights should not incur direct charges for utilization of USAC services, but the USAC -- through an annual appropriation from general government revenues  -- should be compensated for costs incurred.
<p>
<b>Fees That Are Fair.</b> Poole proposes a fee structure based on the technique of marginal cost pricing that utilizes the earlier pioneering analysis of Richard Golaszewski.<b>36</b> Golaszewski established marginal cost estimates for each of the four major user groups (airlines, commuters, general aviation, and military) for each of the key air traffic control services (air traffic control centers, flight service stations, terminal radar control facilities, and air traffic control twoers) and then allocated to each group their estimated share of fixed costs and other overhead.<b>37</b> Poole modifies these cost estimates by inflating the original 1985 estimates to 1991 levels and by reducing non-commercial general aviation's share of the costs to direct marginal costs actually incurred. Congress should further modify the Golaszewski/Poole proposal by deleting fees charged to the military and instead covering such costs incurred by the USAC on behalf of the military (which would have amounted to $8.3 million in 1990) out of general government revenues. 
<p>
With this modification, a new fee structure that meets the four principles above and covers all costs of operating the USAC would be approximately like that indicated in the table on the previous page. This table provides the specific fee per aircraft for each service incurred for each of the four main categories of civilian aviation.
<p>
<b>Savings for Passengers and Airlines.</b> The benefits of a privatized ATC system, stimulated by the profit incentive and free to pursue modern and innovative solutions to air traffic control problems, would be substantial. One airline estimates that a satellite-based air traffic control system modeled after the military's Global Positioning System would allow for precision approaches to airports and could save the airline industry $525 million per year through delay reduction, direct flight routing, and other improvements. Other analyses put the range of savings from ATC improvements in the range of $300 million to $1.5 billion per year.<b>38</b> As noted earlier, even greater savings would accrue to the taxpayer. Both DOT and the Senate Budget Committee project annual federal budget reductions of as much as $2 billion per year from corporatizing or privatizing FAA's ATC functions, largely by shifting the funding of its capital requirements from the taxpayer to the credit markets where it more logically belongs.
<p>
Management efficiencies and service improvements would follow from the USAC's ability to escape current civil service restrictions that make it difficult to fill key positions in high-cost areas because of pay caps and national pay scales. Under the current system, key towers and control facilities in such critical places as New York City, Chicago, and Los Angeles frequently are understaffed because of an uncompetitive pay scale. Similarly, the end of civil service constraints would allow the hiring of more professional managers with the business skills and experience to implement a comprehensive overhaul of the system.
<p>
Most important, freedom from congressional meddling and second-guessing and an end to federal procurement requirements and red tape would allow for swift implementation of a badly needed, but oft-delayed and error-plagued, technological upgrade of the system.
<p>
<b>Taking Care of the Work Force.</b> Obviously, a restructuring involving nearly 50,000 employees entails substantial and complicated transition issues, including labor contracts and explicit and implicit employment commitments. To ease the transition and reduce employees' uncertainty regarding their treatment, a formal commitment could be made to entitle the transferred workforce to civil service retirement system benefits already earned. This commitment could be financed out of general government revenues in the same way that earned worker health and retirement benefits were maintained when the post office became an independent government corporation in 1970. Alternatively, interest earnings on -- and, if necessary, the surplus in -- the Aviation Trust Fund could be used to cover the unfunded liabilities in the civil service retirement obligations for employees transferred to the USAC. For all workers hired after the formation of the USAC, a new pension system would be established that is fully funded and consistent with private-sector norms.
<p>
<br>
<b>The FAA's Flight Safety Responsibilities</b><br>
All existing FAA air transport safety, licensing, and certification functions would be transferred to a new independent transportation safety agency, the Interstate Transportation Safety Office or Administration (ITSO), as discussed earlier. This new entity could be funded from general revenues or from a portion of existing waybill and fuel taxes. At present, the FAA has primary safety rule-making authority, which includes certificating aircraft and developing and enforcing operating rules and procedures. Other safety functions include pilot and mechanic licensing, accident investigation, airport safety, safety analysis, and information.
<p>
ITSO would be responsible for continuing the safety-related duties now performed by the FAA and by the other transportation safety-related divisions within DOT and elsewhere. Under the current organizational arrangement, portions of these functions are located in the FAA's Regulation and Organizational Analysis Division, Regulations and Standards Training Division, Airport Safety and Operations Division, Office of Aviation Systems Standards, Civilian Aviation Security, and the Associate Administrator for Regulation and Certification. All of these functions and staff would be transferred to the Aviation Safety Division of the new ITSO. Funding for the aviation division of ITSO could come from the existing freight waybill tax, fuel tax, international departure tax, and interest earnings on the trust fund. DOT's 1994 "Air Traffic Control:  Analysis of Illustrative Corporate Financial Scenarios" estimates that the FAA's safety duties cost $700 million in FY 1993.
<p>
<b>Better Safety.</b> Although the FAA has an excellent reputation for overseeing one of the safest air transport systems in the world, there is always room for improvement. The proposed restructuring could help facilitate this for several reasons. First, undistracted by its commercial-type ATC functions, an independent flight safety component could devote all of its attention and energy to promoting safety. Second, and related to this, those responsible for maintaining safety no longer would have to make the compromises necessary in an entity with multiple, and at times conflicting, objectives. As the operator of the ATC system, FAA essentially regulates itself and is required to make tradeoffs in trying to promote both safety and the health of the U.S. aviation industry.
<p>
<b>Airports and the Airport Improvement Program</b><br>
Funded from the Aviation Trust Fund through a portion of the passenger ticket tax and other dedicated taxes, the Airport Improvement Program (AIP) provides grants to eligible airports for certain infrastructure projects. The federal government owns no civilian airports, except for Dulles and National, both of which serve Washington, D.C., and are now operated under long-term lease to a regional authority. Of the nation's 17,000 civilian airports, 13,000 are privately owned (mostly small and serving non-commercial general aviation primarily). The other 4,000 are owned by local governments or regional public airport authorities. Within these 4,000 are all of the airports served by the commercial airline industry as well as all of the hubs, both minor and major. 
<p>
In any given year, the AIP provides just a fraction of the funding for eligible airport improvement projects, with the largest and busiest airports receiving the smallest cash return relative to passenger ticket taxes paid. A 1990 analysis found that major airports at Boston, New York City, Los Angeles, Newark, and San Francisco received in annual entitlement grants less than 12 percent of the amount they contributed to the Aviation Trust Fund in ticket taxes. Meanwhile other airports (including, for example, such smaller airports as Charlotte, Dallas, Love Field, and Memphis) each received more than 30 percent of their contribution.<b>39</b> (Because the passenger ticket tax also partly funds the FAA's air traffic control and safety responsibilities, AIP grant returns will always be well below 100 percent of ticket tax revenues.)
<p>
<b>Costly Mandates.</b> As with urban mass transit and the Highway Trust Fund, the regulations and mandates attached to federal airport grant money may be more costly than the value of the grant because they constrain an airport's ability to tailor its services to the specific needs of its community and diminish its incentive and ability to become financially more self-sufficient. In return for accepting these funds, airports must agree to a number of federal regulations, including how and how much they charge for landing fees, caps on passenger fees, and limits on the utilization of surplus revenues earned on airport operations, as well as numerous other revenue and spending restrictions.
<p>
For example, federal law requires that airports charge landing fees based on weight of the aircraft, even though small planes take as much time and runway space to land as large planes. This leads to overuse of scarce airport resources by planes carrying only a few passengers. Peak load pricing for landing fees is also prohibited, thereby removing any direct financial incentive for passengers, aircraft, and airlines to schedule flights at less congested times, and for passengers to be charged accordingly. Likewise, the Federal Anti-Head Tax Act prohibits airports from charging passengers a use fee of more than $1, $2, or $3 per passenger and limits how these revenues may be used. In a number of cases, the FAA has forbidden airports from applying such funds to improvements in surface transit access that could alleviate vehicular congestion and delays. And sections of the Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982 prohibit federally funded airports from using any profits generated at the airport for non-airport purposes, thereby discouraging cities and communities from fully developing the economic potential of their airports.<b>40</b>
<p>
Because of the many onerous strings attached to federal grants, many airport managers have concluded that they would be better off without this assistance. A 1987 DOT poll of operators of hub airports found that the majority of large, medium, and small hub operators would be willing to give up federal financial assistance, including airport improvement grants, in return for the elimination of the numerous federal restrictions on their operations and the freedom to set their own fees on airport users.<b>41</b>
<p>
The airport grant program should be terminated along with the FAA's passenger ticket tax, a portion of which funds AIP grants from the trust fund. At the same time, all the needless federal restrictions and prohibitions on airport fees, revenues, and profits should be struck from the law. Airports should be free to fund their operations and their expansion and improvement programs with financial resources derived from their own choice of fees, rents, taxes, or other measures. With no limits on profits or what can be done with them, airports would have an incentive to develop their facilities more intensively with rent-paying hotels, restaurants, parking facilities, retail stores, offices, and other businesses that would pay a premium to be either at or near an airport. 
<p>
Airports also could alter their landing fee structure by raising fees at peak times -- early morning and late afternoon -- and lowering them at off-peak times to encourage airlines to shift flights to less congested periods. Similarly, they could reimpose some form of a ticket tax, or head tax, but at well below current rates. Whatever the choice, the source and amount of the replacement revenues would conform more closely to the specific needs of a particular airport, as well as the passengers and airlines it serves. At the same time, improvement projects at any airport would occur when it chose, not when officials in Washington finally approve and schedule the project. 
<p>
To accomplish this, the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 and the Airport and Airway Improvement Act must be amended substantially, and the remaining portions of these laws limited largely to legitimate safety issues and <i>bona fide</i> issues of interstate commerce. These legislative changes would better facilitate airport privatization at the discretion of existing airport owners (primarily state and local governments), or regional authorities established on their behalf. Currently, such privatizations are authorized, albeit on a restrictive basis, by Executive Order 12803, issued by President George Bush on April 30, 1992, and implicitly endorsed by the Clinton Administration, which issued Executive Order 12983 on January 6, 1994, to clarify federal law facilitating such privatizations. These orders, and FAA's narrow and limiting interpretation of them, should be reviewed and changed as necessary to reflect the broader privatization options that would be available under the above proposals.
<p>
<br>
<b>What Congress Should Do</b>
<p>
<li>Transform the Air Traffic Control system into an independent corporation. This could be either government or private, funded entirely by direct user fees.
<p>
<li>Transfer FAA safety responsibilities to a new federal safety department.
<p>
<li>"Defederalize" airports by freeing them from non-safety-related regulations as well as financial support from the Airport Improvement Program.
<p>
<br>
<b>THE COAST GUARD</b><br>
With an annual budget of approximately $3.7 billion, the Coast Guard (CG) performs a variety of services, including coastal law enforcement and national defense, marine safety, environmental protection, search and rescue, and navigation and waterway management (traffic management, ice breaking, and maintenance of navigational aids).
<p>
Given the large changes in its objectives over the past several decades in response to the rapid increase in drug smuggling, the Coast Guard and its law enforcement and defense functions should be transferred to the Department of Justice to permit better coordination with other federal law enforcement agencies and activities. Related Coast Guard functions also should be transferred to Justice. These include the Office of Command, Control and Communications; Office of Engineering, Logistics and Development (ELD); Office of Personnel and Training; Office of Readiness and Reserve; and Military Personnel Command. ELD would be given more of an oversight function, with much of the work now done in house performed by the private sector on a contract basis.
<p>
With its focus now primarily on law enforcement, the Coast Guard's search and rescue duties should be limited to extreme emergencies and severe weather. Routine rescues and assistance to recreational and commercial boaters would become the responsibility of the more than 200 existing private rescue services that handled more than 40,000 cases last year. Among other savings, this should allow for a significant reduction in the number of Coast Guard air and sea facilities, including the 185 small boat units now maintained by the Coast Guard, as recommended by the General Accounting Office.<b>42</b>
<p>
The Office of Marine Safety, Security and Environmental Protection should be split among existing government departments. Environmental responsibilities should be shifted to the EPA, and oversight for marine safety matters should be transferred to the proposed Interstate Transportation Safety Office. The Coast Guard already is using the private sector for some licensing and inspection, and this should be accelerated. Merchant vessel regulatory issues other than safety or environment should remain within the divisions transferred to Justice.
<p>
Waterway navigation, maintenance, and safety responsibilities of the Office of Navigation Safety and Waterway Services that are purely local or regional in scope -- rivers, bays, ports, and harbors -- should become the responsibility of contiguous states. Those of an unambiguous national nature would remain with the Coast Guard as reconstituted within the Department of Justice. Many of these functions could be privatized easily. GAO, for example, has recommended the VTS 2000 system now under development as a candidate for privatization. The Port of Los Angeles VTS system already has been privatized.
<p>
<br>
<b>The Maritime Administration (MARAD)</b><br>
The Maritime Administration was created in 1950 to ensure that the United States maintained a domestic maritime fleet in case of national emergency. Organized as an agency within the Department of Transportation, it spends nearly $700 million a year implementing a series of Depression-era maritime laws that shield U.S.-flagged vessels from foreign competition. 
<p>
MARAD's Operating Differential direct subsidy program pays U.S.-flag vessel operators the difference between the costs of shipping cargo on a U.S.-flagged vessel and the costs of shipping on a foreign-flagged vessel. The Ocean Freight Differential program (authorized by the Food Security Act of 1985) subsidizes a portion of the cargo preference costs on agricultural food aid shipments for commodities exported with grants or loans from the Department of Agriculture. Cargo preference laws require that 75 percent of such exports be transported on U.S.-flagged vessels. The Jones Act, authorized by the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, requires that cargo transported between two U.S. cities be carried on U.S.-built and U.S.-flagged vessels. MARAD also maintains the merchant ships retained in the Defense Ready Reserve Fleet.
<p>
The Maritime Administration should be closed down, and the Operating Differential Subsidies, Cargo Preference rules, and Jones Act should be repealed. The government-owned merchant ships in the Ready Reserve Fleet should be sold and the Federal Ship Financing and Maritime Guaranteed Loan programs ended.
<p>
For over sixty years, the federal government has spent billions on a variety of programs intended to support the U.S. maritime industry. Instead, these programs have undermined the competitiveness of U.S. shipping and shipbuilding. Today, only about four percent of waterborne cargoes imported and exported from the United States are carried on U.S.-flag carriers. According to the GAO, between 1982 and 1992 the number of U.S. privately owned ships decreased by 31.4 percent, from 574 to 394.<b>43</b>
<p>
The Maritime Administration pays over $200 million in direct Operating Differential subsidies to 48 oceangoing container ships and 27 bulk cargo vessels. Most of these subsidy contracts are due to expire by the end of 1997. The Clinton Administration's FY 1996 budget requested a reduction to $154 million. However, the Administration also would create a new Maritime Security Program which would give $100 million per year in direct payments to up to fifty U.S. flagged vessels for a period of ten years. This proposal should be rejected.
<p>
In 1994, the GAO reported that "the application of cargo preference to food aid programs does not significantly contribute to meeting the intended objectives of helping to maintain U.S.-flag ships as a naval and military auxiliary in time of war or national emergency or for purposes of domestic or foreign commerce."  The GAO found that by sheltering U.S. shippers from competition, "cargo preference laws make it possible for U.S. ship owners to maintain inefficient and commercially uncompetitive U.S.-flag ships that do not significantly contribute to the ability of the U.S. merchant marine to carry foreign commerce other than food aid."<b>44</b>
<p>
MARAD's Ocean Freight Differential program spends over $60 million a year reimbursing the higher costs paid by the Department of Agriculture to export domestic agricultural products. These cargo preference requirements, as they are known, also increase by some $520 million annually the shipping costs for the Departments of Transportation and Defense, the Agency for International Development, and the Export-Import Bank. The Maritime Administration does not reimburse these agencies for these added costs. Meanwhile, Jones Act restrictions on inter-city cargo transport cost consumers billions of dollars but do not show up on the federal budget. According to a September 1994 study by the International Trade Commission, the Jones Act increases costs to American consumers by at least $3 billion annually, and perhaps by as much as $10 billion.
<p>
The Maritime Administration spent $330 million in fiscal 1994 and $205 million in fiscal 1995 maintaining the fleet of government-owned merchant ships known as the Ready Reserve Force. By all accounts, these vessels are in such a state of disrepair that only a few could be made seaworthy in time to carry cargo for the Persian Gulf War. These ships should be sold for whatever the government can get for them.
<p>
<br>
<b>What Congress Should Do</b>
<p>
<li>Shut down the Maritime Administration.
<p>
<li>Repeal the Operating Differential Subsidies, the Cargo Preference Rules, and the Jones Act.
<p>
<li>Privatize the Ready Reserve Fleet.
<p>
<li>Terminate the Federal Ship Financing Program and the guaranteed loan program.

Lecture 536: Downsizing Government, by Senator Abraham
 -- Heritage </title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<b>Heritage Lecture No. 536</b>
<p>

<hr>
<h3>Downsizing Government:  Eliminate the Commerce Department</h3>
Senator Abraham addressed a meeting of The <a href="http://www.townhall.com/heritage">Heritage Foundation</a>'s Washington Policy Roundtable on July  26,  1995.
<p>
<br>
As the Co-Chair of the Dole Task Force on Eliminating Government Agencies and the <a href="gopher://gopher.senate.gov/">Senate</a> sponsor of the Department of Commerce Dismantling Act, I am extremely pleased to have the opportunity this morning to discuss our efforts to eliminate the <a href="http://www.doc.gov/">Commerce Department</a>. I also want to take this opportunity to thank The Heritage Foundation for putting forward detailed proposals for eliminating several Cabinet departments; many of your suggestions have found their way into the four Cabinet elimination bills that the task force has developed.
<p>
In my mind, no issue better symbolizes the dramatic changes that have occurred since the November elections than the ongoing efforts to eliminate departments of the federal government.  Just a year ago, members walking the halls of Congress were discussing the merits of making the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/">Environmental Protection Agency</a> a Cabinet-level department.  Today, Morton Kondracke is predicting on "The McLaughlin Group" that, contrary to prevailing opinion, the Department of Commerce will not be eliminated this year.  I don't agree with his prediction, but I like his choice of topics.
<p>
Our task force was set up to examine ways to dismantle four Cabinet departments:  Commerce, <a href="http://www.doe.gov/">Energy</a>, <a href="http://www.hud.gov/">Housing and Urban Development</a>, and <a href="http://www.ed.gov/">Education</a>. These four departments alone employ more than 74,000 bureaucrats and have combined budgets of $70 billion -- 133 times more than the entire federal government spent at the turn of the century. We must target these departments if we are truly to restrain the growth of government, reduce the tax burden on American businesses and workers, and balance the budget.
<p>
The goal of our task force is not simply to "zero out" these Cabinet departments, but rather to examine rational approaches to consolidate, privatize, and/or devolve back to the states their functions.  In our efforts, we adopted the following four principles as our guide:
<ul>
<p>
1) Those programs deemed unnecessary or wasteful are terminated;
<p>
2) Those programs duplicative of other departments or agencies are consolidated;
<p>
3) Those programs that serve a valid purpose are transferred to more appropriate agencies; and
<p>
4) Those programs which can be better performed outside the government will be privatized.
</ul>
<p>
By applying these guiding principles, our Cabinet proposals both reduce the federal spending on, and increase the effectiveness of the truly vital functions of, each department. 
<p>
Now let me turn to our efforts to dismantle the Commerce Department -- the only department slated for elimination in the congressional budget resolution.  As former Commerce Secretary Mosbacher notes, the department is "nothing more than a hall closet where you throw in everything that you don't know what to do with."  In my judgment, no other department better symbolizes the waste and duplication prevalent in the federal government than Commerce.
<p>
First, many of the department's functions are either duplicated or outperformed by other government agencies and private industry. Its own Inspector General notes that the department has evolved into a "loose collection of more than 100 programs," while the GAO states that Commerce "faces the most complex web of divided authorities," sharing its "missions with at least 71 federal departments, agencies, and offices."
<p>
Second, its bureaucracy is bloated, its infrastructure is in disrepair, and more than 60 percent of its resources are dedicated to noncommercial activities. For example, almost 60 percent of the department's $3.6 billion budget is consumed by the <a href="http://www.noaa.gov/">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)</a> -- the nation's weather and ocean mapping service.
<p>
Third, many of its programs are simply a waste of taxpayer dollars.  A prime example is the notorious Economic Development Administration.  At some point in its history, 40 percent of the EDA's loans were in default, while economic assistance grants were being distributed to such economically troubled areas as Key Biscayne, Florida.  Even when it is effective, the EDA duplicates the efforts of numerous other programs in other departments.
<p>
Today's Department of Commerce cannot be "reinvented." Its problems can be solved only if it is dismantled. Using the four guiding principles I mentioned earlier, our Commerce legislation would do the following:
<p>
First, we would eliminate unnecessary, duplicative, and wasteful programs such as the EDA, the Minority Business Development Agency, the U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration, the Technology Administration, and the <a href="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/">National Telecommunications and Information Administration</a>.
<p>
Second, we would transfer the various functions of NOAA -- which comprises the lion's share of the department's budget -- to more appropriate agencies and departments, or to private institutions.  For example, seafood inspection would be transferred to the <a href="http://www.usda.gov/">Department of Agriculture</a>, which already carries out most food inspection programs.  Marine and estuarine sanctuary management would be transferred to the <a href="http://info.er.usgs.gov/doi/avads/index.html">Interior Department</a>, which already manages some fisheries.
<p>
Third, we would transfer many of the Commerce Department's trade programs to agencies where their functions may be better performed.  Nineteen distinct federal agencies are charged with promoting U.S. exports, but only 8 percent of total federal spending on trade promotion is directed by Commerce. Secretary <a href="http://www.doc.gov/misc/BrownBio.html ">Ron Brown</a> may argue that Commerce leads federal efforts at export promotion, but almost three-quarters of the export promotion funds go to the Department of Agriculture, not Commerce. 
<p>
Unfortunately, the very traits that make Commerce a likely target for elimination -- its hodgepodge of unrelated agencies -- also make navigating its elimination through the legislative process extremely difficult.  Commerce offers something for everyone, and our efforts have stepped on a lot of toes. In the end, however, I believe we will prevail for the simple reason that, while one can justify many of the programs under the Commerce umbrella, there is no justification for the umbrella itself.  It's an accident of political evolution, not the product of sound policy.
<p>
For that reason, dismantling the department presents us with the unique opportunity to rationalize many of the functions currently under its jurisdiction, including those functions related to trade.  Let me say at the outset that I am a big proponent of free and expanded trade.  During my campaign for the U.S. Senate, I endorsed the <a href="http://the-tech.mit.edu/Bulletins/nafta.html">North American Free Trade Agreement</a>, a politically difficult position to take coming from an industrial state like Michigan.  In fact, I was the only candidate from either party to do so.  Expanded trade does increase American jobs and living standards.
<p>
Clearly, establishing contacts and building trade relationships is important.  But just how effective is the current structure of our federal trade programs?  Opposition to dismantling Commerce comes from two sources -- bureaucrats in the Department who stand to lose their power and prestige, and certain portions of the business community who are concerned about our proposed reforms of the department's trade functions. Their principal concern is that Commerce is essential to promoting American exports abroad.  In fact, in testimony before a House committee the other day, Secretary Brown claimed that the Commerce Department is a "job creator" that builds the economy by increasing exports.
<p>
You might have heard the claim that trade advocacy and counseling efforts by the Commerce Department "returned $10.41 to the federal Treasury for every dollar invested in export promotion."  According to the Department of Commerce, this number and others like it are based upon undefined estimates.  As the Heritage Foundation's Joe Cobb pointed out in testimony Monday before the House Commerce Committee, "estimate" means "made up." Other economists agree. Robert Shapiro of the Progressive Policy Institute and former economic advisor to Bill Clinton argues that there is "no economics" to the notion that export promotion creates jobs. Shapiro states, "All you can do with them is increase jobs for companies with the clout to get the subsidy. But that's at the expense of industries that don't have the clout. You're just shifting things around."
<p>
None of this is to say that the federal government has no role in promoting international trade.  My legislation begins the important process of consolidating our trade functions by transferring them to more appropriate agencies, thereby increasing their efficiency and effectiveness. As former Commerce official Wayne Berman points out, "You shouldn't negotiate open markets in one department and then try to exploit those open markets in another department. It ought to be a focused, well coordinated effort."
<p>
The Commerce Department Dismantling Act embraces this view by transferring over 70 percent of the International Trade Administration, including the Import Administration and the Foreign Commercial Service offices, to the USTR, creating one office where our trade agreements are negotiated and enforced.  In addition, the legislation creates a series of Industry Advisory Boards composed of representatives from the private sector to provide advice to policymakers and to ensure that industry has a "voice" in any administration.
<p>
Another trade-related agency my bill affects is the Bureau of Export Administration.  As it is currently situated, the Export Administration is criticized for two failings.  According to the defense community, it does a poor job of analyzing risks and protecting U.S. security interests.  Meanwhile, businesses criticize the Administration for being unresponsive to many requests by industry, often sitting on applications for extended periods of time instead of notifying the exporter of possible problems.
<p>
Given these criticisms, I see legislation to dismantle the Department of Commerce as an opportunity to make the Export Administration more responsive through two basic reforms: First, setting a time limit for granting export licenses and second, formalizing, either legislatively or through report language, the inter-agency process by which licensing concerns are raised.  These two reforms would make the BXA a much more effective partner with businesses while protecting our national security.
<p>
In conclusion, let me say that the 104th Congress has a historic opportunity to stop the growth of government and move us toward the limited central government envisioned by our Founding Fathers.  Given this opportunity, it would be a tragedy if one of the flagship efforts of the new leadership, the effort to eliminate the Department of Commerce, is defeated.  It will be impossible, in my judgment, to successfully address the massive growth of government and balance the budget if we cannot even address dismantling this department and redesignating its core functions to other agencies.  If we lack the will to do this, it will be virtually impossible to implement the reductions in social service programs that will be necessary to achieve balance.
<p>
My point is this: If we cannot dismantle the Department of Commerce simply because 8 percent of total federal spending on trade promotion must be spent by the department, then where can we cut spending? In my judgment, if we don't dismantle one of the least defensible Cabinet departments, then we won't make the tough decisions to limit spending for other sympathy-engendering spending programs.
<p>
In closing, I believe the goals of the Dole Task Force on Eliminating Government Agencies and those of American industry are the same -- limited government, efficient regulation, low taxes. In that sense, the elimination of the Department of Commerce is more than just a symbol for eliminating government waste;  it's a  key step in downsizing government for the benefit of all Americans. I hope that we can work together to make the elimination of this department a reality.

<center><h3><i>CONGRESS, NOT CLINTON, SUPPORTS THE END OF CORPORATE WELFARE
</i></h3><P>

Backgrounder Update #253<br>
June 16, 1995<br>
<p>
Updating <I>Rolling Back Government: A Budget Plan to Rebuild America</I>, May 1995.<br>
<hr width=50%></center>

<P>

 Despite much talk in the Clinton Administration about ending
&quot;corporate welfare,&quot; the Administration actually has
flinched from offering concrete proposals. When President Clinton
released his first Fiscal Year 1996 budget in February, there
were only a handful of proposals to end corporate subsidies. And
when the President unveiled his revised budget blueprint last
week, he recommended only a $25 billion reduction in unspecified
corporate subsidies - and took pride in drawing attention to his
plans to boost spending on two high-technology pork programs slated
for termination by Congress. 
<P>
  The President's weak attack on corporate welfare contrasts sharply
with the way in which Washington policy groups and the new Congress
responded to the Administration's call to trim unnecessary business
subsidies. The Heritage Foundation, along with many other research
organizations such as the Cato Institute and the Progressive Policy
Institute, have reviewed the federal budget and identified dozens
of corporate welfare programs that should be eliminated. In <I>Rolling
Back Government: A Budget Plan to Rebuild America</I>, The Heritage
Foundation identified more than three dozen spending subsidy programs
as corporate welfare that should be reduced or eliminated, producing
more than $100 billion in savings over the next five years. As
the attached table illustrates, many programs were included in
the House and Senate budget proposals, but not in either one of
the President's two budget proposals. 
<P>
 For decades, the federal government has been providing American
businesses with billions of dollars in spending subsidies. These
have been justified by proponents as necessary to enhance U.S.
competitiveness in the world economy, encourage the development
of high technology products and research, maintain a strong national
defense, or assist socially disadvantaged groups. Most of these
spending subsidies are concentrated in three industry groups -
agribusiness, transportation, and energy and natural resources
- to support research, advertising, and other costs of doing business
that achieve these goals.
<P>
 Experience indicates that most spending subsidies for business
do not achieve their goals and are not in America's economic interest.
These subsidies can be expensive and actually hurt the economy.
Subsidizing one business or industry rather than another distorts
private investment decisions, taking resources from more efficient
uses. Over the last ten years, for example, the federal government
has spent, on average, about $14 billion annually subsidizing
production of wheat, corn, cotton, rice, and other commodities.
More than half of farm payments flow to farmers with gross farm
sales in excess of $100,000 annually. This has led to crops being
planted and harvested at great - but subsidized - cost in places
where production is uneconomic. Allowing farmers to make their
production decisions based on market forces rather than government
subsidies would result in a far more efficient farm economy.
<P>
 Some subsidies are just a waste of money, providing little economic
benefit. The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) is an excellent
example. SBA is supposed to aid the development and expansion
of small businesses through direct and guaranteed low-interest
loans worth more than $11 billion annually. However, SBA's loan
loss rate is greater than that of private lenders, and the U.S.
General Accounting Office (GAO) has questioned whether the SBA's
assistance actually helps stimulate small business development
at all. Other examples of waste include: monies from the $4.6
billion Community Development Block Grant program to pay for swimming
pools, carousel renovations, and other forms of local pork, and
the $17 million spent each year by the U.S. Travel and Tourism
Administration to help the $55 billion tourism industry promote
tourism in the United States.
<P>
 Rather than end corporate welfare, Clinton's budget actually
would add the high technology and information services sectors
to the list of heavily subsidized industries. The nation's economy
has been shifting from manufacturing to a high technology and
information services base. This has been occurring without government
help. But the Clinton Administration wants Congress to enact generous
subsidies to promote high technology products and research. For
example, the President proposes to increase, &quot;by almost $500
million a year by 2002,&quot; the Advanced Technology Program
(ATP) and the Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP). In <I>Ending
Corporate Welfare As We Know It</I>, the Cato Institute points
out that in 1994 ATP money went to a number of Fortune 500 firms,
such as AT&amp;T, Shell Petroleum, Inc., Boeing, Inc., and Chevron
Corporation. At the same time the President is proposing to increase
such subsidies, he also is proposing to increase taxes to end
corporate welfare by eliminating a set of still undefined &quot;corporate
loopholes&quot; and &quot;special interest tax breaks.&quot;
<P>
 Spending subsidies too often either enrich those who have already
detected good profit opportunities or direct private capital into
less efficient investments. An example of the latter is the Administration's
support for high speed rail systems. The GAO reported that, without
federal support, such systems are unlikely to be built because
the private sector does not consider them to be financially viable.
The costs of laying one mile of track for a high speed system
can run between $10 million and $20 million. Nevertheless, the
Administration has supported spending as much as $1.3 billion
over five years, even though the American taxpayers might never
see one mile of high speed track. 
<P>
 Taxpayers may recall that programs like this have been proposed
and funded more than once before, only to turn into expensive
white elephants. In the late 1960s, the federal government spent
nearly $1 billion on the Supersonic Transport, which went bankrupt
and never flew a single passenger. In the late 1970s, the federal
government spent more than $2 billion on the Synthetic Fuels Corporation
to produce new forms of energy, but it was shut down without producing
a single kilowatt of power.
<P>
 Only when spending subsidies clearly provide a benefit in the
national interest, such as a strong defense, should they be preserved.
Because it is a legitimate function of the federal government
to provide a national defense, &quot;uneconomic&quot; investments
in the research and development of new defense technology are
justifiable. For example, R&amp;D investments within the Department
of Defense are critical to preserving the nation's security and
cannot be considered corporate welfare - even though they should
be scrutinized carefully for waste. On the other hand, the part
of NASA's budget spent on aeronautical research and development
programs that subsidize R&amp;D for the commercial aircraft industry
should be eliminated.
<P>
 As the House and Senate work on a final budget resolution, lawmakers
must resist the last-minute pressure of corporate special interests,
take a far bolder step than the Clinton Administration, and adopt
the deep cuts in corporate welfare. If Congress does not adopt
the House proposals in the final budget bill, it will show a lack
of will to make even the most basic cuts in spending subsidies,
the true &quot;corporate welfare.&quot; If so, Congress will be
guilty of the same hypocrisy as the Clinton Administration, which
has ignored its own call to end corporate welfare. Congress must
demonstrate evenhandedness in ending wasteful, unnecessary programs
and start making significant cuts in corporate welfare in the
FY 1996 budget.

<P>"The framers of the Constitution were great clockmakers in the science of statecraft, and 
they did, with admirable ingenuity, put together an intricate machine, which promised to 
run indefinitely, and tell the time of the centuries."</P>

<I>--James M. Beck,<BR>
Solicitor General of the United States, 1925-28</I></P>

<P>	<FONT SIZE = "+3">I</FONT>n 1800, when the nation's capital was moved from Philadelphia to Washington, 
D.C., all of the paperwork and records of the United States government were tightly 
packed into 12 boxes, and then transported the 150 miles to Washington on a horse and 
buggy. That was truly an era of lean and efficient government. </P>
<P>	In the early years of the Republic, government bore no resemblance to the 
colossal empire it has evolved into today. In 1800, the federal government employed 
3,000 people and had a budget of less than $1 million ($100 million in today's dollars). 
That's a far cry from today's federal budget of $1.6 trillion and workforce of 3 million.</P> 
<P>	Since its frugal beginnings, the U.S. federal government has come to subsidize 
everything from research into Belgian endives to maple-syrup production to the 
advertising of McDonald's french fries in Europe and Japan. In a recent moment of high 
drama before the Supreme Court, during oral arguments involving the application of the 
interstate-commerce clause of the Constitution, a bewildered Justice Antonin Scalia 
pressed the solicitor general to name a single activity or program that our modern-day 
Congress might undertake that would fall outside of the bounds of the Constitution. The 
stunned Clinton appointee could not think of one.</P> 
<P>	To win the epic battle over the budget that is now looming on Capitol Hill, this is 
precisely the type of question that fiscal conservatives need to start asking. It is 
instructive that during the entire debate over the controversial 1994 Crime Bill, not a 
single Republican rose up on the House or Senate floor and attacked the $10 billion in 
social spending on the grounds, not that it was wasteful, but that most, if not all, of it is 
simply not the proper responsibility of the federal government. Conservatives should 
have been asking the question: Where is the authority under the Constitution for 
Congress to spend money on midnight basketball, modern-dance classes, self-esteem 
training, and the construction of swimming pools?</P> 
<P>	In other words, fiscal conservatives need to go beyond making the case that 
government wastes money--which it surely does--and start making the case that most 
federal spending today is illegitimate because it lies outside Congress's spending powers 
under the Constitution.</P> 
<P>	The idea is not radical, nor is the strategy futile. For the first 150 years of this 
nation's history, proponents of limited government in Congress and the White House 
routinely argued--with great success--a philosophical case against the creation and 
expansion of federal social-welfare programs.</P>
<P>	There are critical lessons here for Newt Gingrich and his allies in their crusade to 
radically downsize government and topple the "old world order" in Washington. </P>
<P>	The U.S. Constitution is fundamentally a rulebook for government. Its guiding 
principle is the idea that the state is a source of corruptive power and ultimate tyranny. 
Washington's responsibilities were confined to a select few enumerated powers, 
involving mainly protecting the national security of the nation and preserving public 
safety. In the realm of domestic affairs, the Founders foresaw limited federal interference 
in the daily lives of its citizens. The minimal government involvement in the domestic 
economy that was envisioned by the drafters of the Constitution would be financed and 
delivered at the state and local levels. </P>
<P>	The enumerated powers of the federal government to spend money are defined in 
the Constitution under Article I, Section 8. These powers include the right to "establish 
Post Offices and post roads; raise and support Armies; provide and maintain a Navy; 
declare War;" and other activities related mostly to national defense.</P> 
<P>	No matter how long one searches through the Constitution, it is impossible to find 
any language that authorizes at least 90 percent of the civilian programs that Congress 
crams into the federal budget today.</P>
<P>	There is no granting of authority for the federal government to pay money to 
farmers, run the health-care industry, impose wage and price controls, give welfare to the 
poor and unemployed, provide job training, subsidize electricity and telephone service, 
lend money to businesses or foreign governments, or build parking garages, tennis courts, 
and swimming pools. The Founders did not create a Department of Commerce, a 
Department of Education, or a Department of Housing and Urban Development. This was 
no oversight: they simply never imagined that government would take an active role in 
such activities.</P>
<P>	Recognizing the propensity of governments to expand, and, as Jefferson put it, for 
"liberty to yield," the Framers added the Bill of Rights as an extra layer of protection of 
the rights of individuals against the state. The Bill of Rights was inserted to ensure that 
government would never grow so large that it could trample on the individual and 
economic liberties of American citizens. The 10th Amendment to the Constitution states 
the Founders `intentions quite clearly and unambiguously: "The powers not delegated to 
the United States by the Constitution...are reserved to the States respectively, or to the 
people." Such plain language would not seem to be easy to misinterpret. Put simply, if the 
Constitution doesn't specifically permit the federal government to do something, then it 
doesn't have the right to do it.</P>
<P>   The original budget of the U.S. government closely reflected the founder's vision. The 
very first appropriations bill passed by Congress consisted of 111 words--not pages, 
mind you, words. The main expenditures went toward paying the costs of the military, 
including $137,000 for "defraying the expenses" of the Department of War, $190,000 for 
retiring the debt from the Revolutionary War, and $95,000 for "paying the pensions to 
invalids." As for domestic activities, $216,000 was appropriated (or roughly what the 
domestic agencies spend in 15 seconds today!).</P>
<P>	Even expenditures for the most charitable of purposes were routinely spurned as 
illegitimate. In 1794, James Madison wrote disapprovingly of a $15,000 appropriation for 
French refugees: "I cannot undertake to lay my finger on that article of the Constitution 
which granted a right to Congress of expending, on objects of benevolence, the money of 
their constituents." </P>

<P>	This view that Congress should follow the original intent of the Constitution was 
restated even more forcefully on the floor of the House of Representatives two years later 
by William Giles of Virginia, who condemned a relief measure for fire-victims. Giles 
insisted that it was not the purpose nor the right of Congress to "attend to what generosity 
and humanity require, but to what the Constitution and their duty require."</P> 
<P>	
In 1827, the famous Colonel Davy Crockett was elected to the House of 
Representatives. During his first term of office, a $10,000 relief bill for the widow of a 
naval officer was proposed. Colonel Crockett rose in stern opposition and gave the 
following eloquent rebuttal to the bill:</P>

<UL>	"We must not permit our respect for the dead or our sympathy for the living to 
lead us into an act of injustice to the balance of the living. I will not attempt to prove that 
Congress has no power to appropriate this money as an act of charity. Every member 
upon this floor knows it. We have the right as individuals, to give away as much of our 
own money as we please in charity; but as members of Congress we have no right to 
appropriate a dollar of the public money."</UL>
<P>	After he sat down and a vote was taken, instead of unanimous approval as had 
been assumed, the measure failed with only a few votes in support of it. (Legend has it 
that Crockett, one of the poorest members of the House at that time, was the only one to 
contribute substantially to a private charitable fund for the widow.)</P> 
<P>	
In a famous incident in 1854, President Franklin Pierce was pilloried for vetoing 
an extremely popular bill intended to help the mentally ill. The act was championed by 
the renowned 19th-century social reformer Dorothea Dix. In the face of heavy criticism, 
Pierce countered: "I cannot find any authority in the Constitution for public charity." To 
approve such spending, argued Pierce, "would be contrary to the letter and the spirit of 
the Constitution and subversive to the whole theory upon which the Union of these States 
is founded."</P> 
<P>	Grover Cleveland, the king of the veto, rejected hundreds of congressional 
spending bills during his two terms as President in the late 1800s, because, as he often 
wrote: "I can find no warrant for such an appropriation in the Constitution." </P>
<P>	Were Jefferson, Madison, Crockett, Pierce, Cleveland, and the countless other 
lawmakers during that age merely hardhearted and uncaring penny pinchers, as the 
federalists often charged? Did they not have within them sympathy for fire victims? Or 
the mentally ill? Or widows? Or impoverished refugees?</P> 
<P>	The answer is of course they were not uncharitable scrooges. They simply felt 
honorbound to uphold the Constitution. They perceived--we now know correctly--that 
once the genie was out of the bottle, it would be impossible to get it back in. Any 
unwarranted government interference, no matter how righteous or well-intended, would 
be, as Madison put it, "but the first link of a long chain of repetitions." Of course, we now 
know just how remarkably prescient Madison and his colleagues were. </P>
<P>	With notable exceptions, through the first 100 years of the Republic, Congress, 
the President, and the Courts remained mostly faithful to the letter and spirit of the 
Constitution with regard to government spending. As economic historian Robert Higgs 
noted in his famous book <I>Crisis and Leviathan</I>, until the 20th century, "government did 
little of much consequence or expense" other than running the military. The total 
expenditures for the federal budget confirm this assessment. Even as late as 1925, the 
federal government was still spending just 4 percent of national output. </P>
<P>	Several major turning points in American history mark the reversal of this ethic of 
extremely judicious use of the government's powers to spend and tax. The first was the 
passage in 1913 of the 16th Amendment, which permitted a federal income tax. This was 
the first major tax that was not levied on a proportional or uniform basis. Hence, it 
allowed Congress a political free ride: It could provide government benefits to many by 
imposing a disproportionately heavy tax burden on the wealthy. </P>
<P>	Prior to enactment of the income tax, Congress's power to spend was held in 
check by its limited power to tax. Throughout the 19th century, most federal revenues 
came from tariffs and land sales. Neither source yielded huge sums. The income tax, 
however, soon became a cash cow for a Congress needing only the feeblest of excuses to 
spend money.</P> 
<P>	The second major event that weakened constitutional protections against big 
government was the ascendancy of Franklin Roosevelt and his New Deal agenda to the 
White House during the Great Depression. During this era, one after another 
constitutional safeguards against excessive government were either wholly ignored or 
spectacularly misinterpreted by the Congress and the courts. Most notable and tragic has 
been the perversion of the "general welfare" clause of the constitution. Article I, Section 
8 of the Constitution says:</P>
<UL>	"The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and 
excises to pay the debts, provide for the common defense, and promote the general 
welfare of the United States."</UL>
<P>	Since the 1930s, the courts have interpreted this phrase to mean that Congress 
may spend money for any purpose, whether an enumerated power of government or not, 
as long as legislators deem it to be in "the general welfare of the United States." That is, 
this innocent clause has become the equivalent of carte blanche spending authority for 
Congress. </P>
<P>	This was exactly the opposite of what the drafters of the Constitution intended. It 
is almost beyond dispute that the Founders meant the general-welfare clause to be a 
limiting provision on government. They meant that the government's spending and taxing 
powers could only be used for purposes that were in the general welfare of the nation and 
its citizens collectively, not of particular groups of citizens--farmers, students, welfare 
recipients, minorities, the disabled. Jefferson was forever concerned that the general-
welfare clause might be perverted. To clarify its meaning, in 1798 he wrote: "Congress 
has not unlimited powers to provide for the general welfare, but only those specifically 
enumerated." </P>
<P>	In fact, when the early federalists began to argue that the general-welfare clause 
gave Congress a generalized spending authority, they were forcefully rebuked. "Can it be 
conceived that the great and wise men who devised our Constitution," asked South 
Carolina Senator William Drayton in 1828, "should have failed so egregiously as to grant 
a power which rendered restriction upon power practically unavailing?" And then he 
asked the question that is really the essence of the issue: "If Congress can determine what 
constitutes the general welfare and can appropriate money for its advancement, where is 
the limitation to carrying into execution whatever can be effected by money?" </P>
	Exactly.
<P>	By the late 19th century, Congress had adopted the occasional practice of 
enacting spending bills for public charity in the name of "promoting the general welfare." 
These laws often made a mockery of this clause. In 1884, Senator John Morgan of 
Alabama stormed to the Senate floor to describe the impact of a relief bill approved by 
Congress to provide $400,000 of funds for victims of a flood on the Tombigbee River. 
Morgan lamented:</P>
<UL>	"The overflow had passed away before the bill passed Congress, and new crops 
were already growing upon the land. The funds were distributed in the next October and 
November elections upon the highest points of the sand mountains throughout a large 
region where the people wanted what was called `overflow bacon.' I cannot get the 
picture out of my mind. There was the General Welfare of the people invoked and with 
success, to justify this political fraud; the money was voted and the bacon was bought, 
and the politicians went around with their greasy hands distributing it to men who cast 
greasy ballots. And in that way the General Welfare was promoted!"</UL>
<P>	But the real avalanche of such special-interest spending did not start until some 50 
years later in the midst of the Depression. In their urgency to spend public-relief funds to 
combat hard times, legislators began to sound openly contemptuous of the constitutional 
restraints designed to prevent these raids on the public purse. "I have no patience 
whatever with any individual who tries to hide behind the Constitution, when it comes to 
providing foodstuffs for our citizens," argued New York Representative Hamilton Fish in 
support of a 1931 hunger relief bill. "I am going to give the Constitution," said James 
O'Conner, a congressman from Louisiana in that same year, "the flexibility--as will 
enable me to vote for any measure I deem of value to the flesh and blood of my day." </P>
<P>	The tradition of pork-barrel spending began in earnest during this period. In 1931, 
for instance, Congress introduced an act to provide flood relief to farmers in six affected 
states. But by the time the bill made its way through Congress, farmers in 15 states 
became its beneficiaries.</P>
<P>	One Oklahoma congressman succinctly summarized the new beggar-thy-neighbor 
spending ethic that had overtaken Capitol Hill: "I do not believe in this pie business, but 
if we are making a great big pie here--then I want to cut it into enough pieces so that 
Oklahoma will have its piece."</P>
<P>	In 1932, Charles Warren, a former assistant attorney general, wrote a popular 
book entitled <I>Congress as Santa Claus</I>. "If a law to donate aid to any farmer or cattleman 
who has had poor crops or lost his cattle comes within the meaning of the phrase `to 
provide for the General Welfare of the United States,' " he argued, "why should not 
similar gifts be made to grocers, shopkeepers, miners, and other businessmen who have 
made losses through financial depression, or to wage earners out of employment? Why is 
not their prosperity equally within the purview of the General Welfare?" </P>
<P>	Of course, we now know Congress's answer: All of these things are in the 
"general welfare." This is why we now have unemployment compensation, the Small 
Business Administration, the Department of Commerce, food stamps, the black-lung 
program, and on and on. Of course, all of this special interest spending could have 
been--no, should have been--summarily struck down by the courts as unconstitutional. 
But tragically, the Supreme Court eventually served as a willing co-conspirator in these 
spending schemes. </P>
<P>	In a landmark 1936 decision, the Supreme Court inflicted a mortal blow to the 
Constitution by ruling that the Agricultural Adjustment Act was constitutional. The 
court's interpretation of the spending authority of Congress was frightful and fateful. In 
its ruling, the court wrote: "The power of Congress to authorize appropriations of public 
money for public purposes is not limited by the grants of legislative power found in the 
Constitution." </P>
<P>	James M. Beck, the great American legal scholar and former solicitor general, 
likened this astounding assault on the constitution to the Titanic's tragic collision with the 
iceberg. "After the collision," wrote Beck, "which was hardly felt by the steamer at the 
time, the great liner seemed to be intact and unhurt, and continued to move. But a death 
wound had been inflicted under the surface of the water, which poured into the hold of 
the steamer so swiftly that in a few hours the great ship was sunk." </P>
<P>	The New Deal Court essentially told Congress: It doesn't matter what the 
Constitution says or what limits on government it establishes, you are empowered to 
spend money on whatever you please.</P>
<P>   And so Congress does, even to the extent that its profligacy has placed the nation in 
great economic peril. </P>
<P>	Other than the Great Depression, by far the most important events that have 
fostered the growth of government in this century have been the two world wars. Periods 
of national crisis tend to be times where normal constitutional restraints are suspended 
and the nation willingly bands together under government for a national purpose of 
fighting a common enemy.</P>
<P>	Yet the recurring lesson of history is that once government has seized new 
powers, it seldom gives them fully back after the crisis ends. Surely enough, this 
phenomenon is one of Parkinson's famous laws of the public sector:</P>
<UL> 	"Taxes [and spending] become heavier in times of war and should diminish, by 
rights, when the war is over. This is not, however, what happens. Taxes regain their pre-
war level. That is because the level of expenditure rises to meet the wartime level of 
taxation." </UL>
<P>	In the five years prior to World War I, total federal outlays averaged 2 percent of 
GDP. In the five years after the war, they averaged 5 percent of GDP. In the years prior to 
that war the top income tax rate was 7 percent. During the war the tax rate shot up to 70 
percent, which was reduced afterward, but only to 24 percent--or more than three times 
higher than it had originally been. </P>
<P>	Government regulations of the private economy also proliferate during times of 
war and often remain in force afterward. Economist Robert Higgs notes that during 
World War I the federal government nationalized the railroads and the telephone lines, 
requisitioned all ships over 2,500 tons, and regulated food and commodity prices. The 
Lever Act of 1917 gave the government the power to regulate the price and production of 
food, fuels, beverages, and distilled spirits. It is entirely plausible that without the war, 
America would never have suffered through the failed experiment of Prohibition.</P>
<P>	World War II was also the genesis of many modern-day government intrusions--
many of which were and still are of dubious constitutionality. </P>
<P>	These include wage and price controls, conscription (which lasted until the 
1970s), rent control in large cities (which still exists), and, worst of all, federal income-
tax withholding.</P>
<P>	In the post-World War II era, Congress has often relied on a war theme to stretch 
its authority into domestic life. Lyndon Johnson launched the modern welfare state in the 
1960s, when he declared a "war on poverty." In the early 1970s, Richard Nixon imposed 
across-the-board wage and price controls--the ultimate in government command and 
control--as a means of winning the "inflation war." In the late 1970s, Jimmy Carter 
sought to enact a national energy policy with gas rationing and other draconian measures, 
by pleading that the oil crisis had become "the moral equivalent of war." </P>
<P>	While government has clearly been the major beneficiary of national emergency, 
the principal casualty has been liberty. This should give us pause as Congress now sets 
out to solve the health-care crisis, the education crisis, the epidemic of crime, and so 
forth. To Congress, a crisis is an excuse to expand its already near-ubiquitous domain.</P>

<H3>Reinvented Government</H3>
<P>	Shortly before his death, Benjamin Franklin was asked how well the Constitution 
would survive the test of time. He responded optimistically that "everything appears to 
promise it will last." Then he added his famous quip, "But in this world nothing is certain 
but death and taxes." </P>
<P>	Ironically, the death wound that has been driven into the Constitution has been 
placed there by precisely those who insist that they want to make it "a living document." 
Yet to argue that we return to the spirit and the true meaning of this "living document" is 
to invite a look of scorn, malice, or outright disbelief from modern-day intellectuals. 
<P>	One is accused of trying to "turn back the clock" when urging that government be 
guided by the original intent of the Constitution. And so few make the case. This, 
ultimately, has left government free to curtail one economic liberty after another. So not 
surprisingly, these liberties have fallen like a row of dominoes. </P>
<P>	It is a strange and sad curiosity that in the entire debate now raging in Washington 
over downsizing government, not a single member of Congress of either party has 
objected to spending on the grounds that "I cannot lay my finger on the article of the 
Constitution which grants a right to Congress to expend money or regulate the economy 
for this purpose." It shows how far we have strayed from constitutional government that 
such a protest is not even bothered with.</P>

<P>	What the Congress needs now is a few Madisons, Jeffersons, Pierces, and 
Crocketts.</P>

<hr>
<P>
 Even though you pay considerable taxes for police protection,
too often that protection fails, particularly in some areas of
the country that are overwhelmed by crime.  Consequently, many
citizens may feel the need to purchase a gun to protect themselves
and their families from the threat of crime.  What they probably
don't realize is how much they are <a href="/atr/tax-presentation/gunoped.html">paying in taxes again</a> when
they purchase the gun, merely for the privilege of defending themselves.
<P>
 All gun sales are subject to a 10% Federal excise tax paid directly
by the consumer.  The purchaser must also pay state and local
sales tax, averaging about 6%.  So right off the top, 15% of what
the buyer pays for a legal gun goes to the government in taxes.
<P>
 But that is just the beginning.  Out of the amount the consumer
pays for the gun, the manufacturer must pay Federal income taxes,
state income taxes, state and local property taxes, federal payroll
taxes, capital gains taxes, unemployment compensation taxes, workmen's
compensation taxes, business license taxes and fees, and utility
taxes.  For any delivery trucks, the manufacturer must pay gas
taxes, tire excise trucks, truck highway use taxes, and heavy
truck excise taxes.  On the phones in the factory, the producer
must pay telephone excise taxes.
<P>
 Altogether, these taxes consume about 30% of what the manufacturer
receives for the sale of a gun.  Counting the excise and sales
taxes paid by the consumer, about 46% of what the purchaser pays
for a legal gun to protect himself and his family ends up going
to the government in taxes rather than for the gun.  So if a good
self-defense weapon costs $200 in total, about $92 of that really
goes for taxes rather than for the gun.  All of the costs of manufacturing,
delivering and selling the gun are paid out of the remaining $108.
<P>
 These taxes are unfair to workers.  In a democracy, taxes should
not be hidden in the prices of products people buy.  They should
be explicit and clear, so that voters can determine whether they
think those taxes are worth what they are getting from their government.
<P>
 Thomas Jefferson wrote, &quot;Government should not take out
of the mouth of labor the bread that it has earned.&quot;  But
that is exactly what our greedy and overreaching government does
today.  It taxes you on your income when you earn it, and taxes
it again when you spend it, and taxes you over and over again
along the way.  As a result, the average family today actually
pays more in taxes than on food, clothing, and shelter combined.
<P>
 Tax relief for working people is long overdue.  Such tax reduction
would give workers more control over their own incomes and economic
future.  A major tax reduction would also greatly stimulate the
economy, leading to more jobs, higher wages, and expanded economic
opportunity and prosperity.

<CENTER><h2><A NAME="BM_1_"><FONT FACE="Times">Frequently Asked Questions<br> about the Taxpayer Protection Pledge<BR></h2>
</FONT></A></CENTER>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Times">When did the pledge begin?</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times"> Candidates and elected officials began taking
the pledge in 1986.  After President Reagan's Tax Reform Act of
1986 was passed, many taxpayers feared that some politicians would
raise income tax rates.  With President Reagan's support and endorsement,
Americans for Tax Reform and a broad-based coalition of groups
including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Federation
of Independent Businesses and hundreds of taxpayer groups throughout
the nation began to ask all candidates for public office to &quot;take
the pledge.&quot;  Every year, all Members of Congress are asked
to take the pledge by Americans for Tax Reform, and all challengers
are asked to take the pledge during each election cycle. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Times">How many Members of Congress have taken
the pledge?</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times"> As of November 1, 1995, 199 members of the
House of Representatives and 32 members of the Senate have taken
the pledge.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Times">Just what does the pledge commit a Member
of Congress to do</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Times">?</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times"> The pledge commits a member to oppose and
vote against any effort to raise the federal income tax on individuals
or corporations.  The pledge does not stand in the way of any
tax decreases or revenue neutral changes to the income tax.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Times">What if I wanted to trade one tax deduction
or credit for another of equal value?</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times"> No problem.  The pledge only opposes changes
in tax deductions or credits that increase the tax burden on Americans.
 Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer has proposed restoring tax
deductibility of health insurance for the self-employed and trading
it for a tax credit of equal value that gives preference to businesses
that sell television and radio stations to certain politically
favored groups.  As this is revenue neutral, the pledge is not
violated.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Times">What about a cut in the capital gains tax
that would increase revenue</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Times">?</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times"> A cut in tax rates is always allowed under
the pledge.  Americans for Tax Reform strongly supports reducing
the capital gains tax rate.  All tax rate reductions that increase
revenue due to economic growth are allowable under the pledge
and are greatly desired.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Times">Do I have to take the pledge every time
I run for office?</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times"> No.  A candidate only needs to take the pledge
once.  Candidates are always welcome to take the pledge each election
cycle and show their continued support of taxpayers.</FONT>

   Many families today say they need two incomes to make ends meet, and they're right but
not for the reason most people think.  They need two incomes because of the high cost of
government:  one to support themselves, and a second to pay their taxes and support the politicians.<P>  
In recent decades, the government has grown so large so fast that over 40 percent of an average family's earnings is soaked up by taxes.  A typical family now pays more in taxes than it spends on food, clothing, and shelter combined.<P>
     In addition, Americans today spend 5.4 billion man-hours a year calculating how much they
owe Uncle Sam in taxes.   The overall size of government itself is undermining families'abilities to live the American dream.  That's why I introduced a bill, the Freedom and Fairness Restoration Act, designed to cut the size and influence of Washington.  It will revolutionize everything the government does-taxing, spending, and regulating-and allow us to keep more of our money and live the way we believe is right. <P>
     The bill starts by replacing our entire current income tax code with a flat tax.  After seven
decades of abuse by corporate lobbyists and self-righteous income redistributors, our tax code is a mess.  Rates are high, loop-holes abound, and families are burdened as never before.<P>  
My bill would scrap the entire code and start over with a simple, low, flat tax.  Modeled after a
plan that Robert Hall and Alvin Rabushka proposed in 1981, it would work like this: You would
add up your earned income, subtract a large personal allowance ($13,100 for a single person,
$26,000 for a married couple filing jointly), take away $5,300 for each child (which is double the
current amount), and then pay a flat 17 percent rate on the remainder.  That's it.  There would be
no special interest deductions or loop-holes of any kind.  You could figure your taxes on a form
as small as a post-card.  In fact, while it takes the average taxpayer 11 hours to do his taxes today, you could this figuring in ll minutes-with no fear that you made a mistake that'll bring out the IRS auditors or missed some clever loopholes that everyone knows about but you.<P>
     Why a 17 percent rate?  That's low enough to give virtually all Americans a major tax cut, but
high enough to meet the government's revenue needs (which will, of course, be reduced under this plan).  With a doubled child deduction, families with children will do especially well.<P>
     Now, the soak-the-rich crowd reflexively claims that a flat tax is by definition unfair.  That's
flat wrong.  Fairness is in fact the flat tax's great virtue.  It's based on the idea of fairness we
learned in grade school : Everyone should be treated the same.  Rather than have fallible
politicians decide which groups should surrender more or less of their earnings to the government, the flat tax sets a single objective standard.<P>
     Indeed, this system will be as progressive as the income tax system we had when John
Kennedy was president.  How so?  The plan's high personal allowance mean that the middle class income folks will pay a far lower portion of their total income to the government than the
wealthy, even if their tax rate is the same.<P>
     A typical family of four, for instance, will pay no income taxes at all on their first $36,800 of
income-the 17 percent rate will only apply to income above that.  As many as 10 million poor
people will be removed from the tax roles entirely.  If you want progressive, this gets the job done without a complicate tax code as long as the Encyclopedia Britanninca.<P>
     Of course, there will be the predictable objections.  Vested interests will fear the loss of such
breaks as the home mortgage deduction.  But by removing the tax code's current punishment for
saving, the plan will swell the capital pool, causing interest rates to drop and demand for housing
to rise.  As housing values hold or increase under the plan-and economic growth soars-only
Washington tax lobbyists will be nostalgic for the old way.  With the flat tax, there will be a single
readily grasped objective standard.  The only thing that matters is whether you have children. 
Otherwise you are treated the same as everyone else.  <P>
     All Americans will benefit mightly form the higher wages and new jobs that such a rational tax
system would be sure to create.  Our twisted tax system today treats investing in new jobs the
same way it treats cigarette smoking-by discouraging it with especially high taxes.    If you want
to put some of your earnings in a stock or mutual fund, that money is hit with double-taxation: it's
taxedwhen you invest it.  No wonder wages have been flat and job growth low.<P>
     The flat tax would end this craziness.  There would, in effect, be no capital gains tax, no tax on dividends or interest, nor would there be a tax on whatever inheritance we try to leave for our
children (why work a lifetime so the government can take half of what you leave behind?).  This
would unleash American talent, work and creativity as never before.  Economic growth would
soar.<P>
     We would still have a tax on business income, of course, but it would be the same flat 17
percent rate that we'd pay on personal income, and a far simpler system for small businesses to
manage than today's ridiculously complicated code.  They would not need to wrestle with
depreciation schedules or other arcania.  They would simply subtract all their expenses from their revenues and pay 17 percent.<P>
     Make no mistake, though, the flat tax is more than just a good government reform to make our tax system simple, fair and pro-growth.  It's a way of telling politicians that we're tired
of being toyed with.   Congress didn't design our tax system to raise revenue for the government
efficiently.  It doesn't do that.  They use it the same they use spending programs-to direct our
money at whatever causes or inerest groups they think are important. 
     Government does not have the competence or the right to make those decisions.  We should
have a tax system that is neutral and let 250 million free Americans decide where their money
should go. <P>
     Oh, and one last thing.  This 17 percent flat tax rate with these personal deductions means a
big tax cut for everyone-especially families who would see their child deduction double. The best
way to keep politicians form spending more and more of other people's money is to reduce their
supply.  Let them cut spending instead. <P>

	<FONT SIZE=+2>G</Font>overnment spends, taxes, and regulates too much.<P>
	<FONT SIZE=+2>O</Font>f all the crises facing America, this one is paramount.  Many other major national problems flow from this fact or are greatly compounded because of it.<P>
	<FONT SIZE=+2>S</Font>tagnant wages and stifled job growth, urban violence and poverty, and soaring health care and education costs are all closely related to or influenced by the unchecked expansion of the public sector.<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2>	O</Font>n a deeper level, the growth of government is our most critical problem because it so greatly affects the definition of what it means to be an American.<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2>O</Font>ur government has expanded, it has assumed duties that previously belonged to families and communities, leaving those institutions weaker and government stronger.  A distinct governing class emerged with a taste for power and an appetite for more.  Often relying upon guile, some leaders of this class worked to extend government's intrusive power far beyond what earlier American generations would have tolerated.  Today, we find ourselves staggering under an immense government burden, serving an entrenched elite that in many ways presumes to be wiser and nobler than the rest of us.<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2>B</Font>asic American rights should include freedom from unfair demands of distant rulers and the right to use our own efforts to build a better future for our children.  Clearly these rights are being undermined by excessively big government and something is very wrong.  Unrestrained growth of government is a threat to the American Dream.  Consider what runaway governmental power  means to the aspirations of a typical American family.<P>
	"John and Marie Hargas" of Westerville, Ohio, work hard, make mortgage payments, save for their children's college tuition, and give to their church and charities.  Their primary ambition is to make life better for themselves and their two small children.<P>
But each year as April 15 approaches, they typically spend eleven hours filling out IRS forms.  When they're through, they discover that more than a quarter of their income has fled to government bureaucrats five hundred miles away in Washington, D.C.  That amount includes 10.5 percent in direct income taxes, and a whopping 15.5 percent in FICA payroll taxes for payments to Social Security.  The government takes Hargas' earnings from their employers before the Hargases ever see it.  <FONT SIZE=+1>Their state and local taxes take 12.6 percent of their income.</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=+2>I</Font>n all, more than 40 percent of the Hargases earnings support government at all levels.  <Address>That is more than they spend on food, clothing and shelter combined.</Address>  In effect, all the work they do from January 1 to May 6 each year is for government.<P>
	<FONT SIZE=+2>E</Font>very American is entitled to ask these fundamental questions: "Does government really have to cost this much?  Are we really getting our money's worth?  Is this a fair cost for the value we receive from government?"<P>
 <FONT SIZE=+2>I</FONT>n addition to direct taxes, there is a hidden cost of government that is much more difficult to measure.  That immense additional cost of government is caused by regulations which increase the price of every product and service we buy from peanut butter to cars.<P>
  <FONT SIZE=+2>R</Font>egulations add at least $580 billion in annual costs to U.S. consumers.  That means the Hargases must spend another large part of their income bearing their share of the rule-writers' burden.  According to <BOLD>Americans for Tax Reform</BOLD>, Americans actually labor until <A HREF="/atr/cogdpak.html">July 9</A> before they stop working for the government's ends and begin working for their own.<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2>T</Font>he Hargases think of themselves as free Americans living in a fair society.  But how free are they really?	In America's peacetime history, never before has government had so much power over family life.<P>
  <FONT SIZE=+2>T</Font>he U.S. public sector budget is larger than the gross domestic product of any country in the world except for Japan and the U.S. itself.  Since 1950, per capita federal spending has tripled.  Federal spending alone has risen from 16 percent of our 1950 economy to 23 percent in 1991.  By the year 2000, spending could be 27 percent of GNP and reach  31 percent by 2010 unless something is done to reverse the trend. <P>
<FONT SIZE=+2>B</Font>ased on current projections, the <BOLD>annual federal budget
</BOLD> will reach nearly 
<UL><L1><BOLD>$1.9 trillion by the year 2000,</BOLD> <L1>
<BOLD>$2.7 trillion in 2010</BOLD> <L1><BOLD>$4 trillion by the year 2020.</UL><BOLD>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2>	E</Font>ach new dollar government spends and each increase in the size of the government relative to the economy represents an encroachment on the freedom of individual taxpayers.  For people like John and Marie Hargas, that means an ever larger portion of their income will be taken from them.  They will have less control over their lives as the government class, dominated by political professionals, becomes more powerful.  Both the Hargas family and the nation will become poorer as freedom is taken away.<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2>A</Font>mericans face a fundamental choice:  Should the government become ever larger as freedom diminishes--or should we take dramatic action now to halt the growth of government and restore greater freedom to our country?<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2>T</Font>he "Freedom and Fairness Restoration Act"
 is a way of saying "Enough is Enough."	It is a comprehensive assault on Big Government, designed to halt its growth, expose its true cost, and limit its influence on the lives of free Americans.<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2>I</Font>t does this by radically reordering the three major activities of the federal government: taxing, spending, and regulating.
<hr noshade=40%><br>
 The Freedom and Fairness Restoration Act proposes:<P>
	<FONT SIZE=+2><BOLD>A Flat Tax.</BOLD></FONT>  Scraps the current tax code and replaces it with a simple and neutral tax code based on 17 percent flat tax on all income.<P>
	<FONT SIZE=+2>Rigid Spending Caps.</BOLD></FONT>   Places unbreachable spending caps on all forms of federal spending to ensure that the federal government will never grow larger in real terms than it is today.<P>
	<FONT SIZE=+2>Program Sunsets</BOLD></FONT>.  Forces the true reinvention of government by ending the authorization of  virtually all existing federal spending programs. <P>
	<FONT SIZE=+2>Open Government</BOLD></FONT>.  Exposes the hidden cost of government, ending income tax withholding and 	requiring the government for  the first time to calculate the cost of regulations.<P>
	<FONT SIZE=+2>Regulatory Relief</BOLD></FONT>.  Treats regulations much like federal spending, requiring annual calculation of  the total costs to the nation of complying with federal regulations, and providing means for limiting this burden.<P>
	<FONT SIZE=+2>Property Rights Protection.</BOLD></FONT>  Secures property rights by requiring the government to compensate landowners whenever federal regulations significantly reduce the value of their property.  <P>
	<FONT SIZE=+2>Rational Risk Assessment</BOLD></FONT>.  Requires the government to determine the cost, benefits, and risks of 	all new regulations before it imposes new costs on the economy.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2>	The excessive growth of government is the central problem of our time. We need the Freedom and Fairness Restoration Act to contain that growth once and for all. </font><P>

<HR>

Their is a new name for tax relief:  "The Freedom and Fairness Restoration Act" introduced by Texas Congressman and House Majority Leader Dick Armey.  Most people call it "the flat tax" for short.<P>

Armey would vaporize the entire federal income tax code and replace it with a simple plan.  Individual taxpayers would add up all their income form wages, salaries, or pension.  Then they would subtract a generous personnel allowance -- $13,100 for a single person, $17,200 for a single head of household, or $26,200 for a married couple, plus $5300 for each dependent.  Then they pay a flat 17 percent on what's left.<P>

Thus, a family of four would pay no income tax on income under $36,000.  A family of six -- two parents, four children -- would pay no tax on income under $47,400.<P>

The small business owner would add up total receipts less cash wages and the cost of goods, services, and supplies used in the business, as well as all capital equipment.  Then he or she pays a flat 17 percent on the remainder.  Translation: the business owner pays only a pure tax on business profits as generally conceived, before tax accountants, lobbyists, lawyers, and politicians start messing things up.<P>

The flat tax permits no credits, deductions, exceptions, or loopholes.  There is nothing that allows elected officials a foothold in the system.  Big business plays by exactly the same rules small business does.  Big companies get no special breaks and cannot easily lobby for them.  Business and individuals alike pay taxes only for themselves; they do not become veritable arms of the IRS collecting for other peoples as they do in a sales tax system.<P>

Best of all, there are no depreciation schedules.  Business owners get immediate expensing for all capital purchases.  There is also no inheritance tax.  Your heirs will pay tax on the income your business or farm generates when you leave it to them.  Maintenance of family business or family farms becomes far easier.  The government gets no information about what your financial holdings are.<P>

Armey modeled his proposal on a 1981 plan by Stanford Economists Robert Hall and Alvin Rabushka, which many consider the simplest and most elegant tax system ever devised.  The beauty of the flat tax is that it taxes all income, just once, visibly, with no intermediary between government and taxpayer, in a way that allows taxpayers to unite against profligate government.<P>

In keeping with its inherent libertarianism, the flat tax is also perfectly neutral with respect to all economic decisions.  There is no penalty against saving, to be sure, and no double or triple taxation of corporate income.  But on the other hand, there is no bias against saving either.  You can save or consume, spend now or spend later, invest your money wisely or waste it if you will.  You can buy foreign goods and luxury items or the cheapest domestic products, even goods from industries with more or less political protection.  There is no way a government planner can encourage you to spend money one wary or the other with differential taxation.  Your purchasing decisions just don't matter.  The tax in all cases is exactly the same.<P>

Compare the falt tax to our present system, which favors consumption over investment, short term over long term horizons, debt over equity, and service over manufacturing industry.  Many in big business and the world of policy wonkery say we should tax consumption more to level the playing field.  Armey says no.  We should tax everything, across the board, less.<P>

Armey builds on the fundamental insight that taxes need reforming because taxes are too high and government spends too much.  The current U.S. tax code is a crazy hodge-podge of conflicting features for a single reason:  once politicians get hold of a tax, they just can't let go.  As a result, minor fixes that could make the current tax code much less a barrier to long term growth just don't get made.  Politicians won't pay for tax simplification and lower marginal rates even if it means much better economic performance over time.  They would much rather have a little money to buy some nice fresh pork right now.<P>

This why we have a capital gains tax.  Capital gains as now administered is a relatively small levy which costs the economy disastrously in terms of lost economic growth.  There is no economic justifications whatever for the tax, but at least we could lessen its impact by adjusting asset bases for inflation, as the Contract with

	By April 15 in most years or April 17 this year, you have filed your tax returns. Maybe you think you are finished with your obligations to Uncle Sam and  now you can enjoy the fruits of your labor for the rest of the year. Right?<P>
	Not so fast. The taxes you paid are really only the visible tip of a much larger iceberg whose deadly mass remains hidden from view. The bulk of these hidden costs come from deficit spending and added costs to all goods and services which are generated by government regulations.<P>
	 The costs are real, they are just not easy to see.  That's no accident.  For years liberal legislators and activist bureaucrats have used stealth budgets to push the growth of government and mushroom federal spending. When hidden regulatory costs are added to the burdens of direct taxes, the price tag is staggering.<P>
	Consider the 12-month calendar.  If you started working on January 1, you would have to work all the way to July 9, more than half the year, to pay for  costs of both taxes and regulations.  Only then, five days after Independence Day,  are you able to start keeping your hard-earned money for your own needs.<P>
  	Imagine America's founders rolling in their graves at the thought of Americans placed in involuntary servitude to their own government until after July 4. Today's government, with its ferocious appetite for taxpayer dollars, eats away at our economic liberty.  The federal tax system of 1995 makes the English Parliament's Stamp Act of 1765, the Townshend Acts and tea duties of 1767, and the Intolerable Acts of 1774 all combined look miniscule in comparison.<P>
	For many years, the Tax Foundation calculated "Tax Freedom Day" as the theoretical calendar day that taxpayers stop working to pay direct taxes.  This year, Tax Freedom Day is May 6.<P>
  	But almost every year since 1969, the federal government has spent several percentage points of GNP more than it takes in from taxes. "Spending Freedom Day" therefore is a date still later (May 16) which marks the day Uncle Sam stops spending the combined earnings of all citizens.  Right now, the national debt has a huge impact on the budget.  Three percent of GNP must be devoted just to pay interest on the debt.  That's more money for interest than for national defense.<P>
	But Tax Freedom Day and Spending Freedom Day don't fully measure the true burden that Washington imposes on citizens.  Why?  Because regulations generated by federal agencies drive up the prices of everything produced or sold in America including services.  The extra money and human resources businesses must spend to comply with regulations is just as much a financial burden on consumers as direct taxes.<P>
   	In 1993, Americans for Tax Reform Foundation originated the idea of calculating the additional days that Americans had to work to pay for regulations beyond Tax Freedom Day and called it "Cost of Government Day."   The purpose of Cost of Government Day is to help people understand the true cost of government's tax and regulatory burden combined.<P>
 	Cost of Government Day is the total percentage of Net National Product consumed by government spending and estimated total regulatory costs.  Government spending is projected in the president's budget forecast.  A reasonable estimate of federal regulatory costs can be made from a 1992 study by Rochester Institute of Technology Professor Thomas Hopkins.<P>
 	This year, July 9 is Cost of Government Day.  That is the date beyond Tax Freedom Day that Americans have earned enough in gross income to pay off their share of government-imposed financial obligations.  It moves later in the year as government spending and hidden taxes increase.<P>
	For two years, we have been paying for President Clinton's 1993 tax hikes.  Every time we buy gasoline we pay higher excise taxes.  Every time we buy groceries or clothing, we pay the so-called "millionaire's" tax.  That tax was supposed to "soak the rich" but really hit small business operators who file personal income taxes rather than corporate income taxes.<P>
	State and local taxes have also increased due to Clinton administration policies.  Unfunded federal mandates and regulations imposed by past Congresses or activist bureaucrats have forced state or local government to spend more money and raise taxes to pay for the mandate.<P>
 	For example, in 1970, Illinois was a leader among states that designed special education programs for children with developmental disabilities.  The programs are costly.  But citizens of that state supported spending money to make sure children with special needs were offered as many educational opportunities as circumstances permitted.<P>
	But Congress took a good idea and ran amok with the passage of Public Law 94-142.  Opportunities became "rights" which imposed massive costs on local school districts all over the country.  Federal regulations made it nearly impossible for school administrators to make common-sense distinctions between special educational costs and purely medical ones.  School boards began to ask if it is really fair that a single student with special needs could cost a district more than $100,000 per year without federal reimbursement that Congress promised when the law passed.<P>
	This pattern of political excess permeates everything Congress did for decades from unjustified increases in federal deposit insurance to unjustified micromanagement of the Americans with Disabilities Act.  Mayor Gregory S. Lashutka of Columbus, Ohio, describes unfunded mandates this way:  "It's like having your Uncle Sam take you to lunch, order your food, and then hand you the check."<P>
	But by far the most expensive silent taxes are federal regulations and unfunded mandates on private business.  In 1993 and 1994, President Clinton's allies in Congress approved a towering stack of new regulations.   The new rules combined with all previous regulations, cost Americans more than $700 billion, or $2,800 per person, in 1994.<P>
	But we should count our blessings.  Had the Clinton administration's 1993 plan for a national health care system become law, Cost of Government Day would be approximately one month later.  We would be working for government well into August.<P>
	In November, 1994, a decisive majority of voters asked for change in the direction Congress has traveled for decades.  Much of that desire for change was fueled by citizens who believed the burden of mandates on state and local governments and regulations on private employers has become far too heavy compared to the benefits that those regulations were supposed to realize.<P>
 	Much evidence suggests the regulatory revolt which shook ballot boxes last November has plenty of steam left. California, for example, faces a ticking time bomb.  Golden State voters are circulating petitions for a hugely popular initiative that would eliminate affirmative action regulations and save the state billions of dollars every year.  Affirmative action programs were originally designed to redress past unjustified discrimination in society at large.  But many have evolved as a system which awards jobs, contracts, scholarships, and academic degrees by arbitrary quotas based on gender or racial identification rather than on merit or qualifications of an applicant.   The nationwide costs of affirmative action programs are estimated at $25 billion per year.<P>
	Indirect costs (not included in Cost of Government Day) of filling out paperwork, reorganizing the workplace, and lost time are in excess of $100 billion per year, according to a 1993 Forbes magazine estimate.   Consider some other examples of regulatory excess which concern voters:
1. Last September, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service relied on a one-paragraph petition by a botanist at the University of California, Davis, to declare three varieties of "fairy shrimp" in Sacramento to be an "endangered" species.  Even though millions of the hardy shrimp are found in irrigation ditches and ponds in California, Europe, Asia, Australia, and Africa, the "endangered" designation caused the closing of a pony ranch that housed a program for needy and disabled children.  The action could cost the Sacramento housing industry $500 million.<P>
2. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is using the 1990 Clean Air Act to create the Employee Commute Option (ECO).  This regulation mandates companies with more than 100 employees located in high-smog urban areas to force a percentage of workers to use carpools.  Violations can cost $25,000 each.  As Eric Peters, an automotive writer for <ADDRESS>The Washington Times</ADDRESS> noted, "The real genius of the ECO mandate is that it turns employers-not the government or the EPA-into the bullyboy."<P>
3. Republican congressional leaders and California initiative backers are leading a national crusade to rein in the cost of lawsuits.  Tort settlements cost the nation at least $150 billion per year.  Creighton Hale, CEO of Little League Baseball, wrote in The Wall Street Journal about a volunteer coach who was sued for pain, suffering, and punitive damages after one of his outfielders was beaned by a pop fly.  A Girl Scouts of America spokesperson told the newspaper that the Scouts must sell 87,000 boxes of cookies annually to pay liability premiums.  So far, the Clinton administration has no plan for major tort reform.  Some observers speculate that Clinton policy could be influenced by the fact that individual trial lawyers donated $470,000 to the president's 1992 primary campaign, according to a CNN report.  Trial lawyers, many of whom collect large percentages of tort case settlement fees, are strongly opposed to any caps on jury awards.<P>
 	The best hope for reversing the damage done by excess spending and regulatory programs is a fully informed citizenry which understands the true costs that regulations impose on their lives.  One of the first bills in the Contract with America to pass the new Congress was one to make it more difficult for Congress to impose unfunded mandates on states without careful economic-impact studies and guarantees of federal money to reimburse state costs.  President Clinton has signed this new law.  The unfunded mandates law should have the impact of slowing down thoughtless federal regulations.<P>
  	Other reforms on the GOP congressional agenda include tort reform, slowing the rate of yearly increases in spending, regulatory reform, property rights protections, pension reform, and returning powers and duties for certain programs back to the states.  When fully implemented, these reforms could move Cost of Government Day earlier in the year by several weeks.	A national consensus needs to determine how much of the fruits of our labor we are willing to surrender to support government.<P>

	<BOLD>We all know that federal, state, and local governments have grown much too large, too intrusive, and too costly. But you may not fully realize just how costly government  has become.<P>
	The average taxpayer works from January 1 to May 6 just to pay taxes. That's every penny we earn for over four months. Only then can we begin to keep money we earn to buy housing, food, and clothing to take care of our families.</BOLD><P>
	Direct taxes are only part of the problem.  When we add the regulatory burden on American businesses and individuals, the average American works until July 9 to pay both taxes and the true cost of regulations. <P>
	This is out of hand. Together, we can begin to turn America around and restore individual liberty, accountability, and responsibility.<P>
	On Nov. 8, 1994, exactly five years after the Berlin Wall fell, Americans rejected the costly failures that 40 years of extreme liberal policies in Congress had brought us.<P>
	Americans who had committed so much time, energy, and treasure to defeating Soviet imperialism, could now focus on repairing the damage that Imperial Washington has caused in their lives.  We have only just begun to turn the corner.<P>
	Americans for Tax Reform (ATR) works in cooperation with hundreds of state and local taxpayer groups to fight against any and all tax hikes.<P>
	Every year ATR asks all Members of Congress and candidates to sign the Taxpayer Protection Pledge committing lawmakers to oppose any and all income tax increases.  To date, 196 members of the House of Representatives and 30 members of the Senate have signed ATR's pledge.  Of the candidates for president:  Bob Dole, Phil Gramm, Robert Dornan, Lamar Alexander, Pat Buchanan,  Alan Keyes, and Arlen Specter have taken the pledge.  Bill Clinton, and Richard Lugar have refused to make this commitment to taxpayers.	ATR also works with state and local taxpayer groups to ask candidates for state legislatures to sign a State Taxpayer Protection Pledge against tax hikes.<P>
	Our goal is to stop tax increases.  This will force politicians to focus on cutting spending, eliminating programs, and returning resources to taxpayers who earn them.<P>
	This is a containment strategy against big government.  Just as the Soviet Empire was told it could not grow by conquest, so too must big government first be told it cannot grow unrestrained as a parasite on the economy.  It must be rolled back and once again become the people's servant, rather than a master.<P>
	 ATR looks forward to working with every taxpayer and every interested group to restrain oversized government.  Just as importantly, our affiliate, the Americans for Tax Reform Foundation (ATRF),  sponsors research and education projects which help inform Americans about the true cost of government. <P>
	 As taxpayer advocate Howard Jarvis wrote, "Death and taxes may be inevitable, but being taxed to death is not"<P>
	As publisher, I take pride in welcoming you to this first issue of our new ATRF newspaper.   American Tax Reformer is dedicated to informing you about current issues in the tax reform movement.  Our goal is to distribute American Tax Reformer to an increasingly wider audience in the general public through libraries, universities, gift subscriptions for students, and other means.  In this way, we hope to fulfill the primary educational mission of the Americans for Tax Reform Foundation.  We hope you like this issue and that you will write us with your comments.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><BOLD>Grover Appears on Donahue<FONT><BOLD><P>

<A NAME="Donuhue">	Americans for Tax Reform Foundation (ATRF) President Grover Norquist was a guest on Phil Donahue's TV show on May 26.  Norquist appeared with Richardson Foundation President Heather Higgins, former TV actor Ben Jones, and Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) to discuss how Congress has changed under the new House Speaker, Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.)<P>
	Jones, a frequent Gingrich political rival and critic, played the part of a Deputy Sheriff named "Cooter" on a 1980's TV series called <ADDRESS>The Dukes of Hazzard.</ADDRESS>  In the wide-ranging discussion, the usually boisterous Phil Donahue audience almost could not get a word in edgewise since the panelists' debate was so lively.<P>
	Hard and fast conclusions are hard to reach in the Donahue format, but few viewers were surprised to hear that Norquist and Higgins found great merit in the first 100 days of the Gingrich speakership whereas Rep. Frank and Ben Jones were quite grumpy about the direction of the new Congress.  Stay tuned.<P></a><CENTER><a href="/atr/bar4.map"><img src="/atr/bar4.gif" ismap border="0"></a>  </CENTER><p>



<FONT SIZE=+1><bold><a name="rock">  Rock the House!</a></center></bold><FONT></p>

	Early July marks the publication of Rock the House, a new book by ATRF President Grover G. Norquist which puts the 1994 elections under a microscope.  With an initial press run of one million copies, Rock the House is certain to become the definitive explanation of how the old Roosevelt Coalition unraveled and was replaced by a conservative coalition as the governing majority in America.<P>
	Norquist believes the Contract with America was central to what happened last November, and he sees it as a model for future politics in America.  The Contract produced an honest connection between campaign promises and policy fulfillment that is all too rare in any election.  People knew what they were voting for, and they now have a standard against which to measure the performance of the elected.<P>
	Rock the House examines the pluses and minuses of the Reagan, Bush, and Clinton administrations and provides a road map for the future. Watch for Rock the House in bookstores this summer. Visa and Mastercard customers may call 1-800-201-7625 to order your copy for $9.65 plus $1.50 for shipping and handling.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><bold><a name="court">Court Blocks Term Limits</bold></FONT></a><p></center>

<p>
 	The U.S. Supreme Court decided on May 22 by a 5 to 4 decision that Arkansas and 22 other states could not limit the terms of members of Congress from those states.  Justice John Paul Stevens  wrote an 88-page opinion which devoted a great deal of space to the merits of term limits as a public policy.  That is somewhat unusual since the merits of the policy should not have been an issue before the court, only the power of the states to decide the policy for themselves.  In dissent, Justice Clarence Thomas stated that the Constitution was silent on the question of whether or not states could determine limits for the terms of its members of the U.S. House and Senate.<P>
	The 22nd Amendment was passed by Congress in 1947 and ratified in 1951. Beginning with President Dwight Eisenhower, that amendment set a limit of two four-year terms for president.  Before that time, the Constitution was silent on limiting the president's term and every president except Franklin D. Roosevelt chose to seek no more than eight years in office.<P>
	The Supreme Court decision seems to close the door on all state and federal legislation on term limits which leaves a constitutional amendment as the only remaining option. A vote in the House in April to limit terms by constitutional amendment was part of the GOP Contract with America.  But backers failed by 61 votes to attain the necessary two-thirds majority.<P>
   		Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) has stated the Senate will likely vote on a constitutional amendment this summer. Public opinion polls show 75 to 80 percent of Americans favor term limits.  The decision did not upset term limits for state and local offices.  National and state term limits organizations are planning now to make term limits an issue in the 1996 elections.<P>

<p>
<FONT SIZE=+2><BOLD><CENTER>Initiatives and Referenda</FONT></BOLD></CENTER><P>

	When Congress refuses to deal with an issue, activists often go to state legislatures to fight for change.  Welfare reform is an example of an issue ignored by Washington, D.C., and championed by state leaders like Gov. John Engler (R-Mich.), Gov. Tommy Thompson (R-Wisc.), and others.<P>
	But when Washington, D.C., and state capitals hide their heads in the sand or man the barricades in defense of the status quo, citizens in 24 states can turn to the initiative process.  Initiatives allow citizens to gather a specified number of signatures of voters on a petition to place a law or constitutional amendment on the state ballot.<P>
	This was the case when Howard Jarvis and Paul Gann placed Proposition 13 on the California ballot in June of 1978.  Proposition 13 cut property taxes in half and just as importantly required a two-thirds majority vote of the legislature to approve any state tax increase.  Other states followed with similar initiatives on the November 1978 ballot.  The subsequent success of taxpayer groups in using the initiative process helped to convince President Ronald Reagan to support the Kemp-Roth tax cut that eventually passed in 1981.  Thus local and state taxpayer groups started a tidal wave using the initiative process at the state level which also influenced federal legislation.<P>
	In 1990, the term limits movement began the long march through the states using the initiative process.  In spite of opinion polls which showed overwhelming public support for limits of six years for U.S. Representatives and 12 years for U.S. Senators, congressional leaders such as former House Speaker Tom Foley (D-Wash.) and former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D-Maine) refused to allow a vote on term limits in either the House or Senate.  Worse, they used tax money to pay for attorneys who filed lawsuits against state term limit ballot questions.<P>
	Most members of state legislatures were usually no more enthusiastic than most members of Congress were about the move to limit their own terms of office.  But fortunately, the voters had one more option: the initiative process.<P>
	Success came in recent years when 21 states passed term limits with an average approval majority of 65 percent.  This groundswell created the right climate to persuade U.S. House Republican leaders that a promise to vote on a constitutional amendment to limit terms of lawmakers should be included in the "Contract with America."<P>
  	This spring, the first vote ever held on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives to limit terms received support from a solid majority of House members, but less than the two-thirds majority needed to amend the Constitution.  None of this could have happened unless the national organization called U.S. Term Limits had prepared the ground by leading fights at the state level using the initiative process.<P>
	Most recently, the drive to abolish affirmative action including racial quotas and set-asides in government contracts has been energized by backers of the California Civil Rights Initiative (CCRI).  CCRI supporters plan to place that initiative on the California ballot in 1996.  Supporters believe the CCRI is needed to strike down all government racial quotas and reintroduce employment and business opportunities where men and women may be judged by the merit of their qualifications and content of their character rather than the color of their skin.  Activists in Colorado and other states are exploring ways to copy the CCRI in their states.  For a copy of CCRI, call Kolt Jones in the ATR Washington, D.C., office at 202-785-0266.<P>
<p>
<HR NOSHADE SIZE=2 WIDTH=100%>
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2><BOLD>Super  Majority States
</CENTER></FONT></BOLD><P>
	Another major reform that is sweeping the nation through the initiative process is a requirement that legislatures may only approve tax increases by a super majority, not just a simple majority.  For example, in 1992 Arizona passed a requirement that any tax increase must receive the approval of two-thirds of both the state house and state senate.  In 1994, Nevada passed a similar two-thirds requirement with 79 percent of the vote.  That state will vote again on the measure since two separate votes of approval by the people are required in that state.<P>	
	Initiative supporters in Ohio, Florida, Montana, and other states are planning to sponsor ballot questions in November 1996 that would approve constitutional amendments to make it more difficult to raise taxes.  California may vote in March of 1996 on a measure to require either a two-thirds vote of the legislature or a two-thirds vote of the people for any tax increase to pass.<P>
	Americans for Tax Reform hosts a monthly conference call on the initiative process which includes leaders of state initiative measures.  The telephone discussion usually lasts for one hour and covers the progress of various state efforts.  If you know of an initiative or plan to sponsor one in your state, please call Kolt Jones at 202-785-0266 to learn more about how to participate in the conference call.<P>

Term Limits</CENTER></FONT></BOLD><P>


	Until the U.S. Supreme Court handed down its May 22 decision which banned state legislation imposing congressional term limits, many states had used the initiative process to place term limit questions on the ballot.<P>
	Before the decision, 21 states had passed congressional term limits by popular vote of the people, usually by overwhelming majorities.  One state that allows initiatives, Utah, passed the provision in the state legislature.  In early May, the New Hampshire legislature became the first assembly in a non-initiative state to pass congressional term limits.  The governor of New Hampshire signed the bill on May 15.<P>
	Almost before the ink was dry on the New Hampshire statute, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the laws of all 23 states which had acted to impose congressional term limits.  Before the decision, more than 90 percent of states which allow some kind of initiative or referendum process had adopted congressional term limits.<P>
	Currently, 20 states have passed measures which impose term limits on state legislators.  Limits on the terms of state officials will remain in force since they were not overturned by the Supreme Court decision which affects only congressional term limits.  This November, citizens of Mississippi will vote on an initiative that will place term limits on all state legislators and local elected officials.  For more information on term limits efforts in your state, call U.S. Term Limits in Washington, D.C., at 202-393-6440.<P>

Buckeye State Super Majority</CENTER></FONT></BOLD><P>


	There are several different initiatives that have "responsibility" as their main message.  In the state of Ohio, Lee Donaho, Executive Director of the National Taxpayers Union of Ohio, has been working on an initiative that would force the legislature to require a three-fifths super majority to enact any new taxes or new tax increases.  For more information, write to Lee Donoho at NTU of Ohio, 2029 Riverside Drive, Suite 101, Columbus, Ohio 43221 or call 614-486-0315.<P>

Sunshine State Tax Cap</FONT></BOLD></CENTER><P>


	David Biddulph, President of the Florida Tax Cap Committee, has a similar initiative that requires two-thirds of the vote of the people to raise taxes.  Voting on your own tax increases?  Yes, 10 states now have the ability to say whether or not they will receive a tax increase.  People in these states can feel the difference too, the tax burden rose nearly 20 percent faster in states without a super majority to raise taxes.<P>
 	 Last year, the need for tax restraint was recognized, discussed, and fought for by the people.  The American people were given the chance to limit government, and they did.  Realizing the impact the I&R process could have, bureaucrats are making the initiative process more time-consuming, bureaucratic, expensive, and out of reach to many American citizens looking for the justice that the initiative process preserves elsewhere. <P>
	 For more information, write to David Biddulph at Florida Tax Cap Committee, P.O. Box 193, New Smyrna Beach, Fla., 32170-0193 or call 904-423-4744.<P>

	On May 9,  four incumbents on the Passaic, New Jersey, city council lost their seats to members of the Passaic Homeowners and Taxpayers Association.  The challengers signed a contract with the citizens of Passaic pledging a 20 percent reduction in taxes.<P>
	The contract contains 10 "common sense points" that will lessen the tax burden of the residents as well as improve the use of their tax money.  Included among these points are provisions to reduce taxes over a three year period (10 percent for FY 1996 and 5 percent for FY 1997 and 1998), reduce city spending to mirror tax decreases, and a freeze on unnecessary municipal hiring and pay increases without council review. <P>

Dozens of Freshmen Take the Pledge
</CENTER></BOLD></FONT>

<FONT SIZE=+2>J</FONT>ackie Gleason loved to tell a story about an old priest from a poor village in Ireland who had never before stayed in a hotel.  Invited to visit New York City for the first time in 1959 as the guest of a foundation, the priest checked in to the Waldorf Astoria.<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2>A</FONT> bell boy carried the clergyman's luggage to his room, opened the drapes, set out glasses and linen, hung clothes in the closet, and performed all manner of service.  Expecting a tip, as the young man started to leave he placed his hand palm up in front of the priest.  Unfamiliar with the gesture, the priest shook the bell boy's hand and thanked him heartily.<P>
	<FONT SIZE=+2>"F</FONT>ather, you don't understand," the bell boy explained  "In this country, it's customary for guests to give us a tip."   The priest was embarrassed since he had no money, but he had an idea.<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="capblue.gif"><br>
<A HREF="etaxho.html"> House List    </A>|<A HREF="etxsena.html">   Senate List</a>	<p>In a thick Irish brogue he asked,  "Tell me young man, do you ever drink?"<P></CENTER>
	<FONT SIZE=+2>"</FONT>Sure!," said the bell boy brightening with enthusiasm, as the joyful vision of an imported bottle of Irish whiskey popped into his imagination,  "I do indeed, Father."<P>
	<FONT SIZE=+2>"W</FONT>ell then," replied the priest, hoping to be of service,  "kneel down and bow your head while I give you the pledge."<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2>W</FONT>hen that priest was young, many men "took the pledge" to shun the excesses of alcohol.  Some took it often and just as often fell short of full compliance.  But the act itself was a sincere promise to try to do better, which is all anyone could ask.<P>
  <FONT SIZE=+2>S</FONT>ince 1986,<BOLD> Americans for Tax Reform (ATR)</BOLD> has encouraged candidates for Congress to take a different pledge.  This pledge requires lawmakers to promise they will shun another addiction common to government  -- that of overspending and excess taxation.  A similar pledge has been offered  to candidates for state legislatures since 1987.<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2>H</FONT>undreds of legislators have signed the ATR Pledge promising constituents to:<P><ADDRESS><CENTER> "Oppose any and all efforts to increase the marginal income tax rates for individuals or businesses;" <P><FONT SIZE=+2><BOLD><IMG SRC="ball_blu.gif">AND<IMG SRC="ball_blu.gif"></BOLD></FONT><P>
  "Oppose any further reduction or elimination of deductions and credits, unless matched dollar for dollar by further reducing tax rates."<CENTER></ADDRESS><P>
<FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>he pledge plays an important part in many  campaigns.  Currently, 31  U.S. Senators and 196 House members have signed up.   Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) and Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas) have joined other presidential candidates who have also signed, including Pat Buchanan, Alan Keyes, Robert Dornan, Lamar Alexander, and Arlen Specter.<P>

	In Grand Rapids, Mich., the Acton Institute for the Study of Religion and Liberty recently launched a one-year welfare reform program which includes four separate projects.  The first project was a highly successful conference held March 29 in Washington, D.C., attended by 200 welfare policy researchers and administrators.  Key speakers included House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), Michigan Gov. John Engler (R), and Mayor Stephen Goldsmith (R) of Indianapolis, Ind.  Two other special Acton projects include welfare reform publications and a speaker's tour.<P>
	The fourth project is a national "better charity" competition to recognize "compassionate, effective, and innovative charitable programs."  Father Robert A. Sirico, president of the Acton Institute, announced in May the institute will award $40,000 in grants to individuals and organizations working to solve social and economic problems.<P>
	"Our Samaritan Awards are a way to honor the accomplishments of creative charities and share their techniques and know-how with others seeking to help the needy," said Fr. Sirico.  He noted that the ideal award-winning programs would be those that help individuals strengthen ties with their family, friends, and community and foster self-reliance and self-esteem by addressing both spiritual and material needs.<P>
	Americans for Tax Reform Foundation (ATRF) President Grover Norquist says he welcomes projects like the Acton Institute idea which look for practical solutions to the costly welfare state.  "It's not enough to oppose government-provided welfare systems, we need to find superior alternatives," said Norquist.<P>
	Three winning model programs will each be awarded $10,000 and there will be $1,000 awards for each of ten finalists.  The entry deadline for Samaritan Awards is July 15, 1995.  Applications and more information may be obtained by writing to The Acton Institute, 161 Ottawa Ave., N.W., Suite 301, Grand Rapids, Michigan 49503 or by calling the Institute at 616-454-3080.<P>  

Rabbi Daniel Lapin<p>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="ww1.gif">
<p><p>Mazel Tov, Mr. Speaker 
	In January, Rabbi Daniel Lapin, president of Toward Tradition, met with House Speaker Newt Gingrich and came away heartened by the speaker's receptiveness to this fairly new organization's message: that new public policy initiatives need a moral grounding, which can be found in Scripture and in Jewish religious traditions.  Speaker Gingrich expressed the hope that more Jewish conservatives will take part in the political process.<P>
	Toward Tradition was founded in 1991.  Its membership includes both Jews and Christians who believe that the success of America's experiment in free government, in the service of a just and good society, depends on maintaining the strong foundation of values that are emphasized in the Judeo-Christian heritage.<P>
  	Rabbi Lapin says neither the Jewish community's spiritual heritage nor its practical interests are best served when the community is chiefly aligned with policies that push the excessive growth and power of government at the potential expense of personal freedom.  To emphasize this point, Toward Tradition took out an advertisement in The New York Times on December 16, 1994, which supported the Contract with America.<P>
	The ad was entitled,  "Mazel Tov, Speaker Gingrich -- We Know All About 10 Point Contracts."  <Address>Mazel tov </Address> is Hebrew for congratulations.  While the ad caused controversy in New York and even provoked responding counter advertisements from more liberal Jewish organizations, it nevertheless generated positive responses as well and focused attention on the Contract debate.  A framed copy of the advertisement now hangs in the speaker's office.<P>
	Since January, Rabbi Lapin has been busy on the lecture circuit talking about how spiritual heritage influences policy questions and is writing a new book.  In addition, he has become the regular host of the Monday night (9:00-11:00) talk show slot on radio station KVI in Seattle, Wash.<P>
  	Toward Tradition is planning a major poll of the American Jewish community to survey current attitudes on policy questions since the majorities in Congress changed in January.  It is also planning a second national conference.  Toward Tradition's first conference last October attracted 400 participants.  Organizers are planning for more than double that number this year.<P>
  	For more information, interested readers may write to Rabbi Daniel Lapin, President, Toward Tradition, P.O. Box 58, Mercer Island, Washington 98040. The telephone number is 206-236-3046 and the fax number is 206-236-3288.<P>
	Information may also be obtained from the California office at 110 Newport Center Drive, Suite 200, Newport Beach, California 92660.  Toward Tradition Vice President Michael Lapin's California telephone number is 714-644-0300 and his fax number is 714-644-2224.   Toward Tradition's Washington, D.C. office may be reached by calling Director of Development Yarden Weidenfeld at 202-872-8723. <P>

Subsidies Cost
</FONT></center></bold><HR NOSHADE SIZE=2 WIDTH=30%>


	ATR recently issued a list of corporate welfare spending programs and government subsidies that should be the first things on the chopping block when Congress pares down the budget.  Leading the list were a number of outdated energy programs that serve few people, yet cost us all dearly.   Direct and indirect subsidies to government-owned utilities alone cost American consumers billions of dollars annually.  ATR supports the elimination of the Department of Energy, privatization of the Power Marketing Administrations, and the elimination of the Rural Utilities Service.<P>
	ATR President Grover Norquist recently said, "We need to get government out of trying to run businesses.  Just look at the mess the government has made of the electric utility industry.  Directand indirect subsidies are taking close to $10 billion out of taxpayers' pockets annually and throwing them at government-owned electric utilities who also receive tax breaks.  At a time when all Americans have been forced to tighten their belts and Congress has to make tough decisions about the new budget, it is absurd to even consider continuing these wasteful spending programs.<P>
	"One of the things the government of Poland learned is that privately-run companies don't need subsidies and bailouts.  Bill Clinton's energy policies should learn from the failures in Eastern Europe, not emulate them.  It's time to privatize and get the government out of the energy business.  The government simply does not need to be in the electric utility industry -- either directly, through subsidies, or through special tax breaks.<P>

<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="reptnote.gif"><P>

	One of the most widely read political columns in America is "Potomac Watch" by Paul A. Gigot in The Wall Street Journal.  When he isn't sparring with analyst Mark Shields on <ADDRESS>The McNeil/Lehrer News Hour,</ADDRESS> Gigot is spotting new trends and personalities.  Gigot's April 14 "Potomac Watch" column described the impact that ATR and ATR President Grover Norquist are having on Washington's agenda.<P>
  	Calling Norquist the "V.I. Lenin of the anti-tax movement," Gigot explains that while once candidates for president courted the endorsement of other major office holders, now they seek support from groups like ATR that emphasize communications with local cadres.  Gigot points out that Grover is a key organizer of meetings of many groups in what he calls the "Leave UsAlone" coalition that resists excessive federal intervention in American life.<P>
	"Real political clout rests with issue-driven activists who can mobilize grassroots networks."  Enter Mr. Network, Grover Norquist.<P>
 	"Mr. Norquist founded his group, Americans for Tax Reform, in 1985, and he now communicates with 1,800 state and local tax outfits."  Gigot point outs that Grover is a key organizer of meetings of many groups in what he calls the "Leave Us Alone" coalition that resists excessive federal intervention in American life.<P>
	"Mr. Norquist is the Grand Central Station of this coalition," writes Gigot.  He also points out that just before Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) announced for president, he started off his campaign by joining Grover Norquist for a photograph to sign the ATR Taxpayer Protection Pledge.<P>
	Well there you have it.  Gigot metaphors describe the ATR president as a deceased Bolshevik, a New York train station, and the bosses of Tammany Hall.  Not a bad combination.<P>

	The Economist is Britain's widely respected contribution to readers of international finance and political trends.  The magazine's "American Survey" department for the April 15-21 issue took note of a new book by ATRF President Grover Norquist called <ADDRESS>Rock the House.</ADDRESS> Comparing the Norquist world view with that of President Clinton's pollster Stanley Greenberg in another new book, a correspondent for The Economist writes:  "Mr. Norquist thinks Mr. Greenberg is in denial.  It is not the party order that is collapsing, it is the Democratic Party.  Meanwhile, the Republican coalition, as he calls it, is going from strength to strength."<P>

	Reporters in France also followed the first 100 days of the new Congress and ATR's impact on the congressional agenda.  On page 36 of  his cover story for the May issue of <ADDRESS>Le temps de l'Eglise</ADDRESS> (Church Times),  the international Catholic magazine published in Paris, reporter Daniel Rabourdin examines the hundred days and after.  The article offers a capsule description of ATR membership and  programs and takes particular note of  how the Taxpayer Protection Pledge is changing Congress.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2>Moving and Shaking</FONT>
<P>


	The ultimate political trade publication in Washington is a slick magazine called Campaigns and Elections.  The May issue devotes one page to ATR's own fuzzy curmudgeon, describing Grover Norquist as one of the town's "Movers and Shakers."  The magazine asked Grover what he would do if he were president (of the country  that is - not just ATR) for one day.  Grover's reply:  "I would fire everybody in government and quit.  Then lock the doors to the White House and Congress, so no one could get back in."  Who says hyperbole can't make a legitimate and humorous point.  That is, if it was hyperbole.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2>Even Gentleman's Quarterly?

<P>
	GQ may not be the first publication that comes to mind when one thinks about news coverage of public policy makers.  But lo and behold, there in the May issue with Mel Gibson on the cover is an earnest looking ATR President Grover Norquist looking out at readers from an article by John B. Judis titled "Newt's Gang."  Grover is flanked by a rogues' gallery of conservative policy strategists such as Heritage Foundation President Edwin Feulner, <ADDRESS>American Spectator</ADDRESS> publisher Emmet Tyrrell, and the CATO Institute President Ed Crane.  The subtitle of the article is "Meet the Real Establishment."  This group was not chosen for its snappy sartorial ensembles. That's why cinema heartthrob Mel Gibson is still on the cover.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2>TV COVERS DAY OF OUTRAGE </FONT>
<P>

	ATR members and friends focused national TV attention on the burden of federal taxation on Saturday, April 15, during a rally across the street from the White House in LaFayette Park.  Speakers included Grover Norquist, President of Americans for Tax Reform (ATR) and the Americans for Tax Reform Foundation (ATRF), Amy Moritz, President of The National Center for Policy Research; Dr. Marlo Lewis, Jr., Executive Director of the Competitive Enterprise Institute; Fran Smith, Executive Director of Consumer Alert; Jeffrey Pierce, Regulatory Analyst for Citizens for a Sound Economy; Peter Ferrara, Senior Fellow for the National Center for Policy Analysis; and Wes Anderson, former Executive Director of Frontiers of Freedom.<P>
	"This protest is for millions of taxpayers who are angry about high taxes, pork-barrel spending, and the growth of the federal bureaucracy," said Norquist.  The Washington, D.C., rally was one of several at sites around the country organized by taxpayer groups under the banner of "Day of Outrage."  Both CBS and CNN ran network stories that night.  More than 60 major net-work-affiliated TV stations as well as independents in major markets ran stories about the rally.<P>
	"We will be protesting, as our forefathers did in Boston Harbor, that runaway tax and spend government policies must stop now," Norquist said.<P>
	Dozens of protestors signalled their approval of remarks by blowing on plastic duck calls with a "no new taxes" slogan printed on each one.<P>
  	Both CBS and CNN ran network stories that night. More than 60 major network-affiliated TV stations as well as independents in major markets ran stories about the rally.  This level of coverage shows that ATR is taken seriously by major media.  Here is a partial list of broadcast reports in major cities which covered this significant ATR rally reaching tens of millions of viewers.  Broadcast times and content are confirmed by an independent report from Video Monitoring Services of America, Inc. for April 15, 1995.<P>

Flat Tax Alternative</FONT>
	Thank you for your prompt response to my request for information on the "flat tax" proposals.  It will help me answer and ask appropriate questions when dealing with neighbors, our local candidates, and radio talk show hosts.<P>
	Two reasons for my interest are:<P>
	1.  I am an American citizen paying taxes to a government which doesn't have a responsible attitude toward spending.<P>
	2.  I plan on starting a small home-based business and even though I am a bookkeeper, the tax laws are presently so confusing that I dread even thinking about April 15, 1996.<P>
	Your ideas are responsible and simplified.  I have contact with many people who would like to receive your "taxpayer action alerts."<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2>Reduce Super Waste</FONT>
<P>
	I have just finished Martin Gross's book "A Call for Revolution" and have run across your organization in a list in the appendix.<P>
	I was one of the citizens convinced of Washington's inefficiencies and excesses long before I read Mr. Gross's book, but I am now inspired to advocate the idea of practical steps towards rationalization and reduction of the super wasteful spending of our seemingly irresponsible governments.  I would welcome and hope to participate in the advocacy of every suggestion Mr. Gross makes, and hope that your organization may provide a channel for that endeavor.  Please be so kind as to send me whatever information you disseminate about your organization and a list of activities.  I would also like a history of your efforts if  you have one or a list of publications which can educate me concerning your public record.<P>

Grover Norquist's new book, <address>Rock the House</address>, is a lively, penetrating account of how the GOP triumphed last November, an election that dramatically underscored the desire of Americans for a fundamental break from the liberal/Beltway politics of the past 30 years.What helps make Norquist's chronicle so superb is that he was absolutely instrumental in helping bring about this positive, seismic shift.  Rarely has such a committed, brilliantly effective activist also possessed such a lively pen!<P>

	I am currently an assistant English teacher working for Saga Prefecture in southern Japan.  I am interested in learning more about your organization as I am concerned about the state of our nation (U.S.A.) and our growing national debt.  I would like to know what I can do to influence Congress from abroad, and also if I can organize fellow U.S. expatriates here in Japan to do the same.<P>
     I look forward to receiving information and advice from your group.  Thank you and please keep up this important work.<P>

<h2>The FCC and the Telecommunications Act of 1996: Putting Competition on Hold?</h2>
</center><br>
<h3>by G.A. (Jay) Keyworth, II and Jeffrey A. Eisenach
<a href="compfoot.html">*</a></h3> 
<P><br>
After years of hard work, Congress passed the Telecommunications Act of 1996, a law designed to "provide a pro-competitive, de-regulatory national policy framework  by opening all telecommunications markets to competition."<sup><A HREF="http://www.townhall.com/pff/compfoot.html#1">1</A></sup>  The bill has been heralded by leaders of both major political parties as a significant step toward moving America's telecommunications system into the digital age.However, as many of us pointed out at the time, the Act did not guarantee a deregulatory outcome.  Instead, it gave the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and state regulatory commissions permission to pursue deregulation.  Unfortunately, the early signs suggest the FCC has gone in the opposite direction, attempting to use the Act to expand its regulatory authority.  
<p>
The best evidence that the Commission has gone astray is its massive "interconnect" order, issued this August.  Intended to implement the provisions of the Act requiring competition in local telephone service, the order established a complex and pervasive system of Federal price regulation, effectively pre-empting the process of private negotiations and state oversight Congress intended as the means to achieve competitive markets.
<p>
This month, acting at the behest of state regulators, local telephone companies and others, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit issued a stay of the FCC's rules, pending a hearing scheduled for early next year.  Thus, by overreaching and failing to abide by the Act's intent, the FCC has allowed the entire process of telecommunications deregulation to be placed, at least in part, "on hold."  The new rules -- and the litigation they have inspired -- will in all likelihood delay the advent of competition for local telecommunications services.  And, as the FCC moves to implement other provisions of the Act -- including its universal service provisions -- the new rules send a worrisome signal that the Commission still views itself as the regulatory czar of the telecommunications marketplace.
<p>
<CENTER><B>The 1996 Act and Congressional Intent</B></CENTER>
<p>
The intent of Congress in the Telecommunications Act was clear: to open up local telephone networks to competition, principally through the interconnection of telephone networks so that all carriers can compete and complete the calls of their customers. However, the Act, like many such massive bills, speaks only in broad terms, leaving tremendous discretion to the FCC and to state Public Utility Commissions charged with implementing its provisions. 
<P>
According to the Act, the interconnection process is to be driven principally through negotiations among the carriers competing in the market.  Congress considered private negotiations, not regulatory fiat, to be the best means of moving rapidly toward a competitive telecommunications industry.  Congress gave the FCC authority to implement the interconnection policy contained in the Act through the adoption of overall guidelines, but did not intend for the FCC to write detailed requirements governing every aspect of interconnection agreements.  That was supposed to be left to the market and to the states, which are authorized to act as arbitrators in cases where interconnection negotiations break down.
<p>
<CENTER><B>Implementation:  Undermining the Law</B></CENTER>
<p>
In some areas of implementation, such as the entry of the Baby Bell telephone companies into video, the FCC seems to accept the broad deregulatory intent of the Act.  But in the interconnection proceeding, the FCC adopted a very heavy-handed, regulatory approach. In its August 1996 "interconnect" order, consisting of more than 1,400 single-spaced pages and 3,200 footnotes, the FCC issued minutely detailed regulations governing local-loop competition.<sup><A HREF="http://www.townhall.com/pff/compfoot.html#2">2</A></sup>  The rulemaking addresses nearly 10,000 issues and sub-issues, and adopts meticulous directives for many of them.  Among the egregious examples of over-regulation is a requirement on how to allocate square footage in a telephone company central office, including how floor plans must be devised.  There is even a requirement that phone companies check with their competitors before remodeling.
<p>
The FCC's approach to implementing the Act demonstrates its lack of faith in the ability of the market and states to promote competition in telecommunications.  For instance, the FCC regulations determine in detail the manner in which interconnection should occur, leaving little room for private negotiations among competitors.  The FCC expressly rejected the prospect that individual states might implement the Act in ways tailored to local market conditions, suggesting that such an approach would create too great an administrative burden for Federal regulators.  Instead, the rules provide for a national baseline for companies to follow in negotiating the price and manner of interconnection agreements.  These provisions usurp from the states their historic authority to regulate local telephony and reduce their role to merely checking that the FCC's rules are followed.
<p>
<CENTER><B>Back in Court</B></CENTER>
<p>
After years of difficult negotiation in Congress, where competing sectors of the telecommunications industry were heard and their interests and the public interest were carefully balanced, the 1996 Act emerged as a bill that no one saw as perfect, but most saw as a step forward.  Importantly, the Act offered the prospect of removing oversight of telecommunications markets from the courts (which have acted as de facto regulators under the infamous "Modified Final Judgment" breaking up AT&T) and placing it back in the hands of the marketplace, the states and -- to a limited extent -- Federal regulators.
<p>
The FCC's interconnection order has had the opposite effect.  By attempting to use the Act as the basis for a Federal power grab, the Commission ensured a court challenge.  That challenge came not just from aggrieved parties (i.e., local telephone companies) who found the Commission's pricing rules unfair, but also from states who saw the order as an infringement on their authority.
<p>
In granting a stay of the FCC's order, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals made clear its view that the Commission's order was more likely to harm competition than encourage it.  "Before the FCC published its regulations," the court found, the parties were "working together to implement the local competition provisions of the Act. The Act's system of private negotiation backed by state-run arbitration was operating without input from the FCC."<sup><A HREF="http://www.townhall.com/pff/compfoot.html#3">3</A></sup>  The Commission's order, said the court, would "establish a price ceiling," which "inevitably confines and restricts the give and take of free negotiations and arbitrations."  As a result of the order, the court continued, "the negotiations preferred by Congress are already breaking down due to the competitors' desire to hold out for the FCC's proxy rates" (i.e., the price ceilings set in the FCC's order).
<p>
The court was also clear in suggesting that the Commission overstepped its bounds. "[W]e are skeptical," it stated, "that the FCC's roundabout construction of the statute could override what, at first blush, appears to be a rather clear and direct indication . . . that the state commissions should establish prices."  As a result, the court concluded, "the petitioners have demonstrated that they will likely succeed on the merits of their appeals."
<p>
Still, no one can be sure how the court -- which will not issue a final decision until at least next Spring -- will ultimately rule.  Thus, the process of creating competition in local telephone markets is effectively on hold.  Such legal wrangling, which may drag on for years, will delay the implementation of the law, denying to consumers the benefits of competition in the local telephone market  -- including access to low-cost ISDN and other advanced services needed for growth of the Internet.   
<p>
<CENTER><B>What Next?  Implementing Universal Service</B></CENTER>
<p>
The FCC's interconnection order has implications well beyond the question of local competition.  In particular, it creates a dangerous precedent as the FCC prepares to implement the universal service provisions of the 1996 Act.
<P>
By November 8, the Federal-State Joint Board created by the Telecommunications Act will make a recommendation to the FCC on implementing the universal service provisions.  The Joint Board is almost exclusively composed of regulators, and it thus will not be surprising if they recommend regulation as the best method of implementation.  If the interconnect rule really does signal the FCC's continued love affair with detailed, excessive regulation, the result could well be yet another attempt to expand Federal authority.  The intent of the Telecommunications Act could, in other words, once again be turned on its head.
<P>
The Joint Board and the FCC should keep in mind a number of principles regarding universal service, including:
<P>
While people may have a "right" to dial-tone service to call the police or paramedics, no-one has a "right for that dial tone to be delivered over wires."  In some cases cellular phone service may be less expensive than wire.  If anything is to be mandated, it should be the service offered, not the technology by which it is accomplished.
<P>
Federal mandates, if any, should be minimal and limited to lifeline telephone service.  Provision of other telecommunications services (for example, voicemail or Internet access) should not be mandated from Washington but left to state officials to order and purchase.
<P>
Federally mandated universal service should be paid for by the Federal government; such subsidies should be raised in a competitively neutral manner and be obvious to those from whom they are collected.  States should be responsible for paying for any supplemental state mandates.  The FCC should set guidelines to ensure that any state subsidies are raised in a competitively neutral manner and are explicit to those from whom they are collected.
<P>
The essentially local nature of universal service  as ordered by Congress and demanded in practice  reinforces many of the arguments advanced by Congress and the Courts on interconnection.  The costs of specific universal service programs are impacted, in large part, by the progress of competition in specific local markets and the pricing of interconnection agreements.  The devolution of Federal authority over interconnection agreements therefore implies the devolution of universal service mandates.  On the other hand, Federal usurpation of state authority on interconnection issues makes state leadership on universal service questions nearly impossible.
<P>
Wherever possible, the FCC should rely on the market, not regulation, to most effectively implement universal service policies.  For instance, competitive bidding (similar to FCC-auctioned licenses for personal communications systems) could be used to control the cost of subsidies in high-cost areas.  Auctions to provide service among potential competitors would reveal the minimum subsidy required for them to provide service.  This would remove the arbitrariness and controversy associated with cost estimation by government mandate.
<P>
<CENTER><B>Moving Ahead:  Accountability to Congress</B></CENTER>
<P>
The telecommuncations marketplace is not yet fully competitive.  Congress recognized the need for continuing, limited oversight by the FCC to manage the transition.  But massive, detailed regulation is not the way to achieve competition.  Instead, in implementing the Telecommunications Act, the FCC should concentrate its efforts on a few overarching issues and articulate a limited number of boundary-setting guidelines.  The practical, prudent approach is for the FCC to defer largely to the states, while preserving the FCC's ability to address significant problems on review.
<P>
If the FCC fails to reaffirm both the deregulatory intent and the devolutionary spirit embraced by the Telecommunications Act, the prospects for rapid progress toward a competitive telecommunications marketplace will be dramatically reduced, and Congress' central intent in passing the Act will be frustrated.   The question for Congress will then be clear:  Will it allow a regulatory agency to flaunt Congressional will, or will it act to ensure that the goal of a competitive marketplace is achieved?<p><BR>

<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<DD>In an attempt to keep Java, Netscape, Windows 95, the Communications Decency Act, the debate over encryption, Pat Buchanan and the rise of the "New Luddites" in perspective, The Progress & Freedom Foundation convened its Aspen Summit '96:  Cyberspace and the American Dream Conference August 4-6.
More than 150 people gathered in Aspen, Colorado, to explore the promise and peril of the Digital Revolution.  "We want to remind ourselves that America's continued progress in the Digital Revolution is not something to take for granted.  Great civilizations sometimes choose paths leading to decay  even, or perhaps especially, in a digital world," said Foundation President Jeffrey A. Eisenach.

<H4>First Panel</H4>
<P><IMG SRC="/pff/asp-pics/society.gif" ALIGN="left">
<DD>David Gergen of U.S. News & World Report moderated a panel discussion on "Shaping American Society for the Digital Age" that featured Philip Burgess of the Center for the New West, Esther Dyson of EDventure Holdings, David Gelernter of Yale University and Heather Higgins of PFF.
<DD>Dyson described how in the digital world people may need to distinguish between public and private persons.  A private person, using encryption technology as a defense mechanism to protect themselves, is ensured of confidentiality in one-to-one communications like e-mail.  However, when one posts information on the Internet for all to see, offers something to sell, or asks for credit to pay bills, that part of their activity becomes public and will require more disclosure and verification.
Gelernter, a Yale University computer scientist and author of 1939:  The Lost World of the Fair, said that America's biggest problems, our failing education system and struggling families, are things computers cannot deal with.  Basically, Gelernter said, we use computers for word processing, data manipulation, information storage and communication.  However, he asked, "compared to Americans in 1939, are we better writers?  More informed?  Better educated?  Richer communicators?"
After the discussion, Senator Bill Bradley (D-NJ) offered "a practical view" on the how the digital revolution is affecting American society.  "When I walk into a labor hall and a union member tells me that he just lost his manufacturing job, what am I supposed to say? 'Great, now you can go get a knowledge job.'"
<P>
<a name="second">
<BR>
<H4>Second Panel</H4>
<P>
<DD>A second panel discussion at the Summit, moderated by Peter Huber of the Manhattan Institute, featured author George Gilder, Jerry Jasinowski of the National Association of Manufacturers, Rich Karlgaard of Forbes ASAP and Jay Keyworth of PFF.  Les Vadasz of Intel offered the "practical view" of the technologies creating the new economy.
<DD>After a series of working group sessions on Education, Regulatory Convergence, Intellectual Property, and Privacy and Censorship, the Summit concluded with a debate on if the "Growth of the Internet is a 'Leading Cultural Indicator' of Progress."

<H4>Toffler Explores Political Flexibility</H4>
<P>
<BR>
<DD>"What do Hillary Clinton and Newt Gingrich have in common?" asked author Alvin Toffler as he opened PFF's Aspen Summit '96.  "They both promised revolutionary change  Hillary in health care and Newt more broadly  and both were slapped down," he concluded.
<DD>Toffler's speech, titled "Future Shock in the Present Tense," described how Americans feel battered by the very acceleration of the Information Revolution.  "They want a chance to slow down and <IMG SRC="/pff/asp-pics/toffle.gif" ALIGN="left">catch their breath.  People, including companies, are disoriented and grasp after anything" that seems to offer reassurance.
<DD>The American political system, its very structure, Toffler said, is ultra stable and resists change.  "It punishes change makers like Hillary Clinton and Newt Gingrich."  Toffler explored whether Americans want a political system that is more flexible and thus might better adjust to the changes in society being engendered by the Information Revolution.  With too many alienated people, Toffler wondered if more flexibility in America's political structure might be needed to avoid violence.
<DD>Toffler also spoke about the importance of no longer discussing "the future of the economy" because it implies a continuation of the industrial age, but instead to focus on "the economy of the future," which will compel a redefinition of basic economic fundamentals.
<DD>In conclusion, Toffler said that the Information Age is shattering existing cultures around the world, and while we can "remain American, we cannot remain Americans of the past but will be Americans of the future."

<H4>It's Time to Pull the Plug on Federal Power</H4>
<P>
<BR>
<DD>Declaring that federally owned power facilities created during the New Deal have accomplished their mission, PFF released a white paper urging their privatization.  The <IMG SRC="/pff/asp-pics/1.gif" ALT="Rep. John Shadegg"  ALIGN=right>paper, co-authored by Representative John Shadegg (R-AZ) and Foundation Senior Fellow Michael Block, proposes a privatization method modeled on Czech experience, where consumers receive a portion of the money from privatization.
<DD>Power Marketing Administrations (PMA's) were designed to provide a supply of inexpensive power to impoverished rural areas; today, many of the once underdeveloped areas are affluent.   "PMAs' assets are of significant value to the private electric energy industry and, if sold by the government, would increase operating efficiency, eliminate market distortions, advance competition in electricity markets, and generate significant revenue for federal deficit reduction," argues the paper.
<DD>The paper  Lights Out on Federal Power:  Privatization for the   21st Century  outlines how the federal government should sell three PMA's, generating nearly $4.5 billion to reduce the budget deficit.

<P>
<H4>PFF Releases Telecom Book, The Innovation Age</H4>
<P>
<BR>
<DD>Peter K. Pitsch, PFF Adjunct Fellow and former Chief of Staff and Research Director at the FCC, authored the newly released Innovation Age:  A New Perspective on the Telecom Revolution.
<DD>Advancements in computer and digital information technologies have created an era of rapid economic, technological and social change that Pitsch calls the "Innovation Age."  Economic growth in this realm, argues Pitsch, depends on constant innovation and competition; therefore, government efforts to regulate these new technologies should adapt to reflect this new paradigm.
<DD>"Today's complexity and change make Hayek's 'spontaneous order' and Schumpeter's 'creative destruction' more compelling than ever before.  Peter Pitsch combines these concepts in a new economics of innovation that provides an illuminating view of telecom  both how to understand it and why market forces will regulate it best," says author George Gilder about The Innovation Age.

<a name="clean">
<P>
<H4>For Cleaner Air,  PFF Says Think Globally, Act Locally</H4>
<P>
<BR>
<DD>A new PFF white paper urges the creation of local Environmental Innovation Areas (EIAs) that recognize the variation in environmental conditions across America and thus will serve to solve regional pollution problems.  The paper calls for using EIAs as a means of promoting alternative fuel vehicles to meet clean air requirements and petroleum import reduction goals.
<DD>"Different regions face different pollution problems, and thus they must be given the flexibility to meet clean air requirements in ways best suited for their region," said Bruce Yandle, a co-author of the white paper, titled Clean Air and Emerging Alternative Fuel Vehicles:  A Time for Environmental Innovation Areas. 
<DD>"Alternative fuel  or non petroleum-based  vehicles pollute less and should serve as an important component of many regions' strategies for meeting clean air goals," says the paper.

<DD>Senior Fellow Jane Fortson, director of PFF's Social and Cultural Studies, continues her involvement in urban issues and the District of Columbia.  She recently joined other District leaders as a founding board member of the DC Agenda Support Corporation, an organization modeled after the highly successful Fund for the City of New York.

<h2>The Unveiling of the Innovation Age </h2>
</center>

On behalf of Hudson Institute and The Progress & Freedom Foundation, I am pleased to invite you to a special briefing on Wednesday, September 11 to unveil Hudson's latest book,<i> The Innovation Age:  A New Perspective on the Telecom Revolution</i>.  The book's author is Hudson and PFF adjunct fellow Peter Pitsch, former Chief of Staff and Chief of Planning at the Federal Communications Commission.<p>


Mr. Pitsch will provide opening remarks, and we have asked <b>Congressman Bob Walker</b> (R-PA) to do the same.  Serving as panel discussants will be <b>William E. Cohen</b>, Deputy Director, Policy Planning, for the Federal Trade Commission and <b> Blair Levin</b>, Chief of Staff for Chairman Reed Hundt of the Federal Communications Commission.  In discussing Mr. Pitsch's new book, they will attempt to answer the following questions:<p>
<ul> 
<li>Is the "Innovation Age" real?
<li>Does it require developing a new political economy of innovation?
<li>Has it strengthened the comparative advantage of marketplace solutions vis--vis regulation?
<li>Are the book's proposed reforms to telecommunications regulation desirable?
</ul>
	Advancements in computer and digital information technologies have created an era of rapid economic and technological change which Mr. Pitsch calls the "Innovation Age."  In the book, he describes how the resulting complexity and potential for explosive growth have increased the cost of regulatory distortions, especially in the telecommunications market.  Peter Passell of <i>The New York Times</i> calls <i>The Innovation Age </I>  "painless introduction to the way economists are now rethinking regulation."<p>

	<i>This special briefing will be held from 1:30 to 3:30 p.m. on Wednesday, September 11, in Room 106 of Dirksen Senate Office Building.</i>  If you would like additional information, please call Mary Brown, Hudson's Director of Special Events, at 317-549-4150.  We hope you will be able to stop by.<p>

<CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Arial">EXECUTIVE SUMMARY<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Advances in technology are perhaps the single
most important ingredient of further progress in providing a cleaner
environment for America and the world.  New clean-up technologies,
more efficient production processes - and simply the transition
from a smokestack-laden industrial economy to a digital economy
- provide the opportunity for today's Americans to live in a dramatically
cleaner world than the one their parents left them.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Unhappily, current environmental policies often
lock obsolete technologies in place, or fail to provide appropriate
incentives for the development and adoption of new technologies
that are both cleaner and less costly than those currently in
use.  Even where our current policies work to encourage the adoption
of new technologies, they do so in ways that are often ineffective,
typically through the use of top-down, command-and-control mandates.
<p> 
Current policies also fail, in many cases, to recognize that
while our commitment to a cleaner environment is national in scope,
the problem is often local or regional in nature - and hence not
easily addressed through national, one-size-fits-all standards.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">America's current policies with respect to
air pollution are a case in point.  Since the 1970s, we achieved
significant progress in reducing emissions, but never enough to
meet clean air standards nationwide.  In response, the 1990 Clean
Air Act Amendments set different rules for the most polluted regions
and called for the development and deployment of new technologies
- including alternative fuel (nonpetroleum-based) vehicles (AFVs).
Yet in implementing a complex patchwork of programs to promote
AFVs, the Executive Branch is utilizing top-down mandates that
attempt to impose a uniform regime on an environmental problem
that varies dramatically by region.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The clean air benefits of AFVs vary widely
by region for two reasons.  First, the types of air pollution
AFVs address are limited mainly to 22 cities, the state of California
and a 12-state region in the Northeast.  Second, the best way
of addressing these pollution problems also varies - in some cases,
AFVs may be the better approach; in other cases, different options
will be more effective.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">At the same time, the national security benefits
of AFVs (i.e., the reduction in American dependence on imported
petroleum) know no regional boundaries and hence call for a national
approach to encourage AFVs.  Achieving national promotion of AFVs
while maintaining regional flexibility in their use to reduce
air pollution is a complex challenge.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Among different alternative fuel technologies
being developed, compressed natural gas and liquefied natural
gas offer the best prospects for AFV expansion.  And while the
infrastructure problem associated with refueling and delivery
of alternative fuels is a challenge, the hurdles for serving important
markets have been reduced significantly in recent years.  In fact,
in some important niche markets, conversion to alternative fuels
is justified on differences in fuel costs alone.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The current government approach to providing
incentives for AFV use is neither efficient nor effective.  For
example, our examination of current policies shows that:</FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">The peculiar atmospheric traits of different
urban areas are not recognized by federal standards designed to
reduce urban smog.</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Efforts by the Department of Energy to
encourage AFV use and federal mandates for the expansion of AFVs
in the federal fleet are not coordinated with EPA's efforts to
improve air quality in metropolitan regions.</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Federal fuel tax policies are not well
geared to provide larger incentives for cleaner-burning fuels.
(State fuel tax incentives are more closely tied to emission characteristics.)</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">The mandated purchase of AFVs by operators
of public and private fleets for the purpose of providing national
security benefits is not accompanied by financial incentives for
covering incremental costs.</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Heavy-duty trucks and other large vehicles,
which offer bright prospects for AFV use, are not covered by federal
statutes designed to encourage AFV use.</FONT>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">America needs a new, more effective and efficient
approach to promoting AFVs.  Among its main features should be:</FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">A program of Environmental Innovation Areas
(EIAs) that recognize the peculiar environmental challenges of
U.S. cities and regions.  These newly created EIAs should be given
complete flexibility in choosing the means for meeting baseline
environmental standards and should serve as coordinating units
for federal efforts to expand AFV use.   </FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Federal fuel taxes that no longer favor
or discriminate against alternative fuels used in the search for
cleaner air.  Instead, tax policy should be designed to provide
incentives for the use of cleaner fuels that address emission
problems reaching far beyond the limits of cities and multi-state
regions.  States and regions should be encouraged to design fuel
taxes that encourage the appropriate use of cleaner burning fuels
in their areas.</FONT>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Furthermore,</FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Federal funds to cover the full incremental
cost of AFVs should accompany federal mandates that require nonfederal
fleet AFV purchases.  Based on past legislative goals considered
by Congress, funding for light AFVs could amount to as much as
$326 million annually.</FONT>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">There are a variety of existing tax subsidy
and expenditure programs that could be redeployed to at least
partly offset this cost.</FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Because AFVs both pollute less and reduce
American reliance on imported petroleum, incentives for AFV use
are a lower-cost way to improve automobile fuel efficiency than
Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards.</FONT>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial"> By removing barriers to expanded AFV use and
deployment of other improved technologies, implementation of these
proposals would reduce the cost of achieving environmental and
national energy security goals.  This plan would expand AFV use
and concentrate environmental benefits in the most appropriate
geographical areas.  Among other benefits of such a program would
be:</FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Multiple Environmental Innovation Areas
(EIAs) that will provide a national laboratory for discovering
lower cost institutions for improving all dimensions of environmental
quality.</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">The more logical expansion of AFV infrastructure
due to the creative and expanded use of EIAs and federally provided
funds to assist with the expansion of the AFV fleet.</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Minimized costs in producing cleaner air
through the encouragement of tradeoffs between AFVs and other
approaches for reducing air pollution.</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Improved technological innovation through
the adoption of new technology.</FONT>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">There is no magic bullet or one best approach
for reducing air pollution in the United States.  A successful
policy for the 21st century will rely on a multitude of solutions
that emerge from those closest to the problem.  AFVs are a proven
technology that offer meaningful environmental benefits.  With
appropriate incentives and flexible institutions for accomplishing
environmental goals, AFVs can become an even more important part
of the environmental arsenal.</FONT>

<h2>Bradley, White to Attend Aspen Summit 96</h2>

Senator Bill Bradley (D-NJ) and Representative Rick White (R-WA) will be among the participants at the Aspen Summit this August 5-6, The Progress & Freedom Foundation announced today.  The Summit will explore whether America's future in the digital age will be one of progress or decay.
<p>
White, who is chairman of the Congressional Internet Caucus, and Bradley, who recently completed a tour promoting his new book <b>Time Present, Time Past</b>, will be among the more than 30 participants at the Summit.  Also attending will be author Alvin Toffler, PBS commentator David Gergen, ACLU president Nadine Strossen, author George Gilder, John Gage of Sun Microsystems, and author David Gelernter.
<p>
"A recurring theme in this election year is the insecurity Americans feel about their future," said Foundation president Jeffrey A. Eisenach.  "The Summit will examine how America can best cope with the transition to a new society  how to make the transition less painful and more productive for all Americans."
<p>
The Summit, to be held at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Aspen, Colo., will also feature a debate on whether the growth of the Internet is a "Leading Cultural Indicator of Progress." Participants will include Edwin Diamond and Stephen Bates, authors of "Smash the Internet" (<i>Weekly Standard</i>, Oct. 30, 1995), G.A. (Jay) Keyworth, former Science Advisor to President Reagan, and Esther Dyson, president of EDventure Holdings.
<p>
Four working groups at the Summit will explore what government policies should be pursued to ensure continued progress toward a better future in the digital age.  Former FCC Commissioner Dennis Patrick will highlight a session on regulatory convergence and Shira Perlmutter, Associate Register for International Affairs and Policy at the Copyright Office, will highlight a session on intellectual property.

<h2>Administration Undermines Information Age National Security</h2>

The Clinton Administration's efforts to control the spread of "encryption" tools that scramble digital communications is putting at risk America's lead in the global communications race and threatening the U.S.'s future ability to protect itself, asserts a report issued today by The Progress & Freedom Foundation.<p>

	Encryption tools are key to the development of on-line banking, protecting privacy in an age when more and more information is stored on computers, and ensuring the authenticity of electronic messages. Fearing that terrorists and drug smugglers will encrypt their communications and thus foil American intelligence's electronic "eavesdropping" capabilities, the Administration is supporting continued controls on the export of encryption software.<p>

	Yet the PFF report, co-authored by G.A. Keyworth, chairman of the Foundation and former Science Advisor to President Reagan, found that "no matter how stringent U.S. export controls, they can do nothing to stop a bright mathematician in Tokyo or Bombay from creating new means of encryption to fill the void left by American abdication of the market."<p>

	The report warned that government attempts to control encryption tools will destroy America's commercial and technological lead in the field.  This will eventually deny America - including the intelligence community itself - the latest encryption tools, because they will no longer be developed in the United States.<p>

In addition, the report continued, the Administration's policies jeopardize America's continued lead in the communications race and thus diminish the rewards of economic growth and new goods, services and social opportunities Americans would otherwise have enjoyed.<p>

<h2>THE COMPUTER REVOLUTION, ENCRYPTION AND
TRUE THREATS TO NATIONAL SECURITY</h2>
</center><br>
<h3>by G. A. Keyworth, II, and David E. Colton, Esq.
<a href="encry-foot.html">*</a></h3> 
<P><br>
 Americans take it for granted that when they a send package via first class
mail its contents are protected.  We do not worry that someone will open our
envelopes and take our checking or credit card account numbers, read our
personal letters, or steal our business ideas.
<P>
Yet our privacy could be threatened as we move to a digital economy, where
more and more information is shared electronically  over the Internet, via
fax machines or on wireless phones.  Right now, the Clinton Administration is
proposing to restrict Americans ability to use "encryption" tools that
scramble digital communications so that they cannot be read by anyone other
than the intended receiver.  Today, basic encryption technology is utilized
every time you punch in your ATM code or use a password to protect files on
your computer.   But better encryption tools are needed to protect the assets
of on-line banking customers, the rights of musicians selling their songs in
Cyberspace or the trade secrets of American companies e-mailing documents to
their overseas branches.
<P>
America currently leads the world in the development of computer software 
including encryption.  Indeed, our current position as the undisputed leader
of the digital age derives from our overwhelming success at winning the
computer race. Start-ups that were born in our garages and hobby clubs less
than twenty years ago have created a whole new economy, the $1.5 trillion
digital industry.  As a result, the nexus of technological innovation and
wealth creation for this new economy is in Silicon Valley, not Tokyo, Paris
or Bonn.  
<P>
<table>
<tr width=80>
<td><hr width=75><h3>The Clinton Administrations attempt to control encryption technology is one
of the most important examples of how outdated regulatory thinking threatens
Americas ability to compete and win in the digital era.
</h3><hr width=75></td>
<td hspace=5>
Yet a new contest is already underway: the race to generate wealth by
connecting computers into a global, digital communications system.  The rules
for this competition are just now being set, and the situation is very
different from the computer race.  The government largely refrained from
regulating the computer industry (no one told Apple or Microsoft or Intel
what markets they could enter or what products they could sell).  In the
communications race, America's regulatory apparatus (i.e., the FCC)  created
in the 1930s, before television networks, cellular phones or e-mail  is a
huge handicap.   Americas competitive lead in the communications race could
be squandered by the retarding forces of excessive regulation, with immense
consequences:  lost technological leadership, fewer jobs and lower standards
of living.
</td></tr></table>

<P>
While the Telecommunications Act of 1996 was an important first step toward
removing roadblocks in the creation of a digital communications network, much
work remains if America is to maintain its international lead.  Our most
formidable opponent is not foreign competition, but a misguided, overzealous
Federal government.  The Administrations attempt to control encryption
technology is one of the most important examples of how outdated regulatory
thinking threatens Americas ability to compete and win in the digital era.
<P><br>
<b>Encryption:  Protecting Your Valuables from Theft</b>
<br>
The encryption concepts at issue are not complicated.  In essence, encryption
technology empowers people to protect their digital property from
unauthorized use.  Whether you are sending an e-mail to a friend, your doctor
is faxing your medical records to the insurance company, you are ordering a
take-out dinner over you wireless phone (and using your credit card number to
pay in advance), or giving the plans for your latest product to your business
partner on a floppy disc, encryption tools allow you to "scramble" your
message.  Only the intended recipient  who holds a "key"  can access the
information.
<P>
Encryption technology is based on strings of numbers (the "key").  The more
numbers in the key, the "stronger" the encryption.  For instance, the
standard ATM code of four numbers would be harder to crack if it were ten
numbers.  The possible variations increase dramatically each time a number is
added to a key, and thus more computing power is required to figure out all
the possible combinations.
<P>
There are two types of encryption.  The first is known as single key, in
which the key to code and decode a transmission is the same. 	The second
encryption system, known as the public key approach, uses two sets of keys.
 One key is publicly revealed, the other is known only to the user.  The keys
are linked in such a manner that information encrypted by the public key can
only be deciphered by the corresponding private key.  Public key techniques
are much more secure than single key approaches.  Such programs are
available, world-wide and generally free, through the Internet.  It is these
public key programs that are the real focus of the Administrations attempt
to restrict encryption tools.
<P>
The Administration seeks to retard development of encryption technologies by
allowing export only of mass market software with "weak" encryption standards
using 40-bit keys.<a href="encry-foot.html"><sup>1</sup></a>   
Similar restrictions apply to hardware and computer
systems.<a href="encry-foot.html"><sup>2</sup></a>
   The stated goal is to slow development of encryption technologies
abroad, so that the intelligence community (CIA, FBI, NSA, etc.) will have
easier access to communications.
<P><br>
<b>Are Encryption Controls Part
of the American Spirit?</b>
<br>
<table>
<tr width=80>

<td>
The Administration invokes "national security" concerns to justify export
control regulations that cripple development of sophisticated U.S. encryption
technologies.  The government claims that it must have the ability to monitor
communications in the digital age in order to protect Americans from
terrorists, drug smugglers and other nefarious types. To achieve this, the
Administration argues, we must control the terms and conditions by which
individual Americans can use sophisticated encryption technology both <i>at home
</i>and abroad.<a href="encry-foot.html"><sup>3</sup></a>   
Even at the height of the Cold War, the intelligence community
never seriously proposed such a massive and pervasive intrusion into the
lives of American citizens.
</td>
<td><hr width=75><h3>Even at the height of the Cold War, the intelligence community never
seriously proposed such a massive and pervasive intrusion into the lives of
American citizens.</h3><hr width=75>
</td>
</tr></table> 
<P>
How we handle this issue has profound implications for American society in
the digital age.   The encryption debate raises serious Constitutional
questions.  What is the role of the Fourth Amendment, which reserves to the
people the right "to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects"?
 What constitutes an unreasonable search and seizure in Cyberspace?  What
rights to privacy can citizens expect in a digital era?  These are major,
fundamental questions that the American people must resolve.  No one yet has
the answers.  Yet the Administrations encryption proposals, if enacted,
would allow what are little more than bureaucratic interests in the national
security community to dictate the answers.
<P>
The outcome of the encryption debate will also shape the foundation for U.S.
economic prosperity in the digital age.  A society of connected computing and
networking requires that all individuals have confidence that their
communications are secure and that messages and data are authentic, not
forgeries.  Encryption is the means to make that possible.
<P>
<table>
<tr width=80>
<td><hr width=75>
<h3>The Administrations attempts to control encryption technology on national
security grounds would actually undermine Americas security in the digital
age.</h3>
<hr width=75></td>
<td>
But encryption technology is not just about privacy and secure
communications.  It is also about protecting intellectual property.  For
instance, with innovative encryption systems, the makers of <i>Jurassic Park II
</i>(for example) would be able to encrypt a digital signal in the movie that
prevents bootlegged copies of it being made and sold on the black market.
 Before artists, entrepreneurs or Fortune 500 companies will invest their
resources in a new digital product, they will demand assurances that it be
secure from theft.
</td></tr>
</table>
<P>
The best means of protection is self-defense.  American companies should be
allowed to develop and use encryption tools to protect their intellectual
property and trade secrets before turning to government for assistance.  In
that sense, encryption can be thought of as the "barbed wire" of the digital
age, allowing owners of intellectual property to be their own first lines of
defense against theft and encroachment, just as barbed wire allowed farmers
on America's prairie to protect themselves against encroachment by wayward
cattle.  Barbed wire was not an <i>alternative</i> to government enforcement of
property rights, but it allowed government to serve as a <i>backstop</i> rather than
as the first line of defense.<a href="encry-foot.html"><sup>4</sup></a>  
<p><br>
<b>Encryption Obsolescence
at Hyper Speed</b>
<P>
To maintain their competitive lead in the digitally connected economy,
American companies are continually creating encryption technologies.  Such
rapid innovation makes the national security and  intelligence communities
goals of controlling this technology illusory.  Governments can no longer
dictate the pace and scope of technological innovation.
<P>
The core concept of the computer revolution, Moores Law, states that the
power of a microprocessor doubles approximately every 18 months while its
costs stay the same.  Thus, in 1984, a desktop computer could execute 2
million instructions per second, but by 1994, the same machine was capable of
256 million instructions per second.  By 1998, a desktop microprocessor will
run more than 2 <i>billion </i> instructions per second.  Such incredible
advancement in computer power guarantees that the intelligence community will
fail to control encryption technology.
<P>
Moores Law makes the focus on encryption key length irrelevant.  So-called
strong encryption is only "strong" relative to available computing power to
crack the string of numbers that comprise the key.  As computing power
doubles every 18 months, no encryption scheme will remain strong for long;
adding numbers to the key merely forestalls the inevitable. Encryption will
be rendered quickly weak without constant innovation .
<P>
Yet the Administration proposes to enshrine in law a mandated encryption
standard based on todays computing power  a standard that would soon be
rendered obsolete by advances in microprocessor speed.  This is not a
theoretical prediction; it is hard fact.  Indeed, the governments preferred
40-bit key has already been compromised  in this case by two French graduate
students using their schools computer to hack Netscape.  Cheap and
affordable chips customized to break encryption keys are readily available.
 For example, one "field programmable gate arrays" chip, costing as little as
$20, can crack the 40-bit key in about five hours.  But many such chips can
be used together, in parallel, to break a 40-bit key in about 24 <i>seconds</i>.
 Clearly, government encryption "standards" would soon be overtaken by
technology, leaving Americans handcuffed in their ability to compete with
foreigners.
<P><br>

<b>The True Threat to National Security: Encryption Controls,
Not Encryption Technology</b>
<p>
The Administrations attempts to control encryption technology on national
security grounds would actually undermine Americas security in the digital
age.  Export controls already are threatening to drive Americas software
industry off-shore.  Allowed to continue, this phenonemon eventually will
deny America -- <i>including the intelligence community itself</i> -- the latest in
encryption technology.
<P>
Among the many problems with export controls on encryption technology, first
and foremost is the fact that they are unworkable.  In the past, it was
possible to contain specific technologies (e.g. metallurgical science applied
to design of submarines or "stealth" airplanes) through export controls.
 These technologies focus on specific capabilities and require significant
infrastructure to be of use.  But digital technology can be taken out of the
country almost effortlessly by transmitting it over the Internet.  And, of
course, nothing can prevent foreigners from coming to America, legally
purchasing encryption technology (at stores such as Wal-Mart) and then
(illegally) taking it home with them. Hackers try to demonstrate the
absurdity of export controls by noting that it may be considered illegal to
wear a t-shirt, when leaving the United States, that has printed on it the
code for an encryption key (the t-shirt would be considered a munition).
<P>
It is also absurd to assume that, just because American encryption technology
is not legally for sale on the international market, that foreign
governments, companies and criminals will not be able to encrypt their
communications and intellectual property.   Unlike, say, nuclear weapons,
which require amounts of difficult-to-obtain materials to build, computer
software design has virtually no "barriers to entry."  Joseph Schumpeters
description of the capitalist firm truly applies here:  "Most new firms are
founded with an idea and definite purpose.  The life goes out of them when
that idea or purpose has been fulfilled or has become obsolete or even if,
without having become obsolete, it has ceased to be new."   This is
particularly apt for encryption technologies.<a href="encry-foot.html"><sup>5</sup></a>

</h3><hr width=75></td>
<td>
No matter how stringent U.S. export controls, they can do nothing to stop a
bright mathematician in Tokyo or Bombay from creating new means of encryption
to fill the void left by American abdication of the market.  A recent survey
of products employing cryptography both within and outside the United States
confirms the lack of barriers to entry in encryption technology.
<a href="encry-foot.html"><sup>6</sup></a>    Companies
from more than 28 countries sell almost 500 encryption products.  If American
leadership stumbles, others are ready and eager to assume the mantle.
</td></tr></table>
  Today, the intelligence community is worried about controlling the latest
encryption technology developed in the United States.  With export controls
in place, Americans may find in just a few short years that the true national
security problem is trying to obtain the latest encryption software developed
<i>outside</i> the United States.
<P>
U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies  perhaps to present Congress
a <i>fait accompli</i>  have urged foreign governments to adopt approaches to
regulating encryption similar to those in America.   But even the adoption by
other governments of proscriptive encryption regulations would not alter our
analysis.  One individual, such as the legendary Phil Zimmerman, can create
an encryption system as widely acclaimed as his PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) in
just five months in his cabin in Colorado.  That program is now available
world-wide through the Internet.  Digital technology and the lack of barriers
to entry mean that individuals  from almost anywhere can circumvent
government-imposed limitations  regardless how many governments impose them.
<P>
Export controls also hurt Americas high-tech industry.   Many law abiding
international customers want to protect their communications and intellectual
property for the same reasons as Americans, and, as noted above, they will
develop the technology to do so themselves if they cannot purchase it from
the United States.  The global demand for secure computing continues to grow
with the spread of connected computing.  After all, the international market
for Internet connectivity is 20 times what it is in the United States.  
<a href="encry-foot.html"><sup>7</sup></a>  In
this burgeoning market, the highest demand over the next decade will be for
goods and services that incorporate the assurance of confidentiality only
encryption can provide.
<P>
Preventing Americas leading companies from selling their products around the
world denies America's software firms the chance to maintain their lead in
the global connected computing race. Already, 60 percent of American workers
are knowledge workers, and eight of ten new jobs are in information intensive
sectors of the economy.  More Americans make computers than cars.  More
Americans make semiconductors than build construction equipment, and people
processing data outnumber those refining petroleum.  Should American firms be
foreclosed from competing to win in this market, the immediate effect may be
a 30 percent loss in market share for computer systems alone.
<a href="encry-foot.html"><sup>8</sup></a>     The impact
on the whole U.S. software industry would be equally devastating and
threatens the commanding 75 percent market share for mass market software
enjoyed by American companies today. <a href="encry-foot.html"><sup>9</sup></a> 
   This is merely a short-term extrapolation.  The long-term effects could be even 
more pernicious: lost technological leadership is rarely recovered.
<P>
Yet probably the greatest threat to Americans national security from the
encryption controls being proposed by the intelligence and law enforcement
agencies would be the loss of freedom on the part of U.S. citizens.  Seeking
to retain some control over public key encryption, the most recent
Administration proposal seeks to have Americans register their personal keys
with a government-approved third party.  This is analogous to the government
asking all Americans to place a copy of their safe deposit box keys with a
government-approved third party.  By coercing so-called "voluntary"
cooperation, the intelligence community asks that every American leave
themselves exposed before the State in the digital age.
<p>
Nothing could be more perverse than to turn the potential of the digital era
to empower individuals into a more invasive means of government surveillance
and control.  We believe that the Administrations positions will not
withstand Constitutional challenge.  The question to ask is why, in light of
all we've learned as America's competitiveness has resurged in this new
digital economy, should we waste our time and energy pursuing something that,
in a Jeffersonian sense, is so patently un-American and which, in the
practical sense of Moore's Law, is simply wrong.  As Americans hesitate, the
window of opportunity for continuing our leadership of the computer
revolution is rapidly closing.  
<P><br>
<b>The Threat To American Intelligence and Law Enforcement Is Overstated</b>
<p>
Together with law enforcement agencies, Americas intelligence community
plays a vital role in safeguarding the nation.  Moreover, in many instances
the resources they can bring to bear to battle crime are without peer.   The
technical capabilities of the U.S. intelligence community, for example, are
the finest in the world.  The community has and will continue to have the
technical and human resources to meet its mission.
<P>
The National Security Agency (NSA) and its sister agencies have the capacity
to break current encryption systems, and there is little reason to believe
they will not have the capability to penetrate future designs.   Public
estimates of  the time the NSA requires to break 40- and 56-bit key codes are
conservative, for the agency has truly massive parallel processing power for
"brute force" attacks on a given code.  More importantly, NSA specialists are
world-class, and can often succeed in cracking an encryption system through
"number crunching."  They often understand the inner workings of a given
program or code and can exploit these vulnerabilities, greatly reducing the
burdens of decryption.  While in the short term encryption controls might
make the NSAs task easier, in the long run, as we have noted above, we as a
nation would suffer greatly.
<P>
For the foreseeable future, the intelligence community can provide
time-urgent penetration of communications networks for collection and
counter-intelligence needs.  Cracking an encrypted digital e-mail may not be
as easy as wire tapping an analog telephone.  Nonetheless, the United States
currently has the technical capability needed for security in the digital
future.  To most effectively utilize these capabilities might require tasking
and prioritizing resources in a new way, something all bureaucracies,
including the intelligence and law enforcement agencies, naturally dislike
because it upsets the status quo.  But, ultimately, the intelligence
community relies on the technical innovation and leadership of the Americas
private sector to keep it at the forefront of developments.   Any decline in
U.S. leadership in the computer race, which controls on encryption technology
will lead to, will have repercussions on the NSAs abilities as well. 
<P>
Domestic law enforcement can also pursue its public safety mission without
draconian invasions into the privacy of citizens through mandatory key escrow
systems.  Clear thinking without emotion is required.  Allegations that
encryption technology will result in future New York City World Trade
Tower-type terrorist incidents or bombings of Federal buildings are
irresponsible.  Encryption technologies, of course, had no connection at all
to either incident. (Indeed, it is worth recalling that the FBIs own
informant tried to warn the Bureau  unsuccessfully  about the impending
attack in New York).  Furthermore, it is just as easy to plot a terrorist
attack through almost completely secure first class mail as it is via e-mail.
<P>
<table>
<tr width=150 hspace=5>
<td>
While there have been and certainly will be instances of law enforcement
agencies successfully averting a crime or catching criminals due to the
monitoring of communications, the FBI and other police agencies must adjust
the existing framework for traditional wireline intercepts to the digital
age.   To do so, they must admit one simple truth: organized crime and drug
cartels  or anyone seriously intending to violate the law  will attempt to
buy the best encryption technology available.  Preventing American industry
from developing it simply means the illegal enterprises will buy the
capability from Japan, Bombay or Taiwan.  They may even pay American software
writers to covertly develop code for them.   Regardless of the method,
criminals will obtain encryption technology.
</td>
<td><hr width=75><h3>
By coercing so-called "voluntary" cooperation, the intelligence community
asks that every American leave themselves exposed before the State in the
digital age.</h3><hr width=75>
</td></tr></table>
<P>
The solution is thus not to "dumb down" the American economy and industry.
 Rather, law enforcement must become more digitally savvy.  Upon obtaining
court authorization for digital surveillance, law enforcement must have
access to sufficient resources in the intelligence community should
encryption issues arise.  If it is a question of sharing resources and
capabilities among national security agencies (who currently have among the
best encryption writing and cracking capabilities) and law enforcement
agencies, Congress can help this to occur by developing new coordination
mechanisms.  Long standing bureaucratic rivalries between law enforcement and
intelligence agencies can (and should) be overcome.  If suitable cooperation
is not forthcoming, law enforcement could be permitted to develop its own
cryptographic capabilities.  That would be a small price to pay to enable
America to compete and win in the digital era.
<P><br>
<b>Controlling our Future in
the Digital Age</b>
<p>
We are in the midst of a profound revolution made possible by the
microprocessor.  It is transforming our society more completely and faster
than did the printing press, the telephone or even the television.   By
winning the first round of the computer race, we reaped the rewards of
 economic growth and new goods, services and social opportunities.  We can
win the race for connected computing as well.  This is the best means of
providing for national security, broadly defined. 
<P>
What is called for in encryption is no less than an end to government
sponsored encryption standards, except for its own use.  Export controls on
commercial digital technology, especially in the consumer realm, should be
terminated.  Moreover, the Federal government should be explicitly barred
from placing restrictions on the sale and use of encryption programs
domestically, and mandatory key escrows should be prohibited.  These steps
are necessary for two, reinforcing reasons:  The first is that such barriers
to our future wealth generating capacity are simply unaffordable;  the second
is that such interventions will not work anyway.  
<P>
In a more general sense, however, it is we citizens, not the intelligence
community, who should determine the nature of our Constitutional heritage in
the digital age.

<TITLE>Just What Is This Ball And Triangle Thing?  -- PFF</TITLE>

</HEAD>

<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="notebook.gif" LINK="#8C1717" VLINK="#545454" ALINK="#FF0000"> <ul><blockquote><a href="/pff"><img src="pffdoc.gif" align="right" border="0"></a>

<P>
<h2>Just What Is This Ball And Triangle Thing?</h2>
<P>
<img src="bi.gif"><P>

We're always being asked what our logo represents, so we thought
we'd explain (but, believing in competition as we do, we thought
we'd offer a couple of alternatives -- each one has its own champions
internally).
<P>
<B>It's From the Story of Sisyphus</B>
<ul>
The Greek myth of Sisyphus, who was king of Corinth, holds that
he saw the god Zeus carry off the beautiful maiden Aegina.  Sisyphus
then told Aegina's father what he had witnessed. Enraged with
Sisyphus, Zeus condemned him to Tartarus, where he was compelled
for eternity to roll to the top of a steep hill a stone that always
rolled down again.(1) The struggle for both progress and freedom
is this -- never-ending, difficult, sometimes torturous.  Absent
inspired action, progress is replaced by atrophy.
</ul>
<B>It's From the 1939 World's Fair</B>
<ul>
Dominating the landscape at the New York World's Fair of 1939-1940
were a white obelisk and globe -- the Trylon and Perisphere --
that came to symbolize the meaning of the fair. For a nation just
coming out of a depression, the fair presented its overall theme
-- The World of Tomorrow -- as a very bright one,  through ever
inventive technology, brilliance of industrial and architectural
design, comprehensive planning, scientific progress and the democratic
ideology.  The fair presented a compelling and cohesive vision
of the world that the New Dealers told us they would make -- a
world based in an industrial planning model that now needs replacing.(2)
</ul>
<B>It's From an Economist's Graph</B> 
<ul>
The idea of progress is for obvious reasons associated with the
idea of change, but the two ideas are different.  Things never
stand still but always move ahead.  Yet the world being the way
it is, things rarely stay constant as they move, but progress
or decay, as in the graph below.<br>
<img src="arrows.gif">
<br>
The nature of progress being what it is, you must have a vision
and sense of right and wrong to know where you should be heading.
 From your starting point you must set out to build a better world,
or else you accept decay.  Thus, you must always be pushing to
ensure progress.(3)<br>

<td valign="top" width="20%">PFF is working to describe what a Transformation of American Life
driven by the new technologies of the information revolution really
means.  How will it change our fundamental values and beliefs?
 Society's elemental relationships?   The organization and workings
of our economy?  And our political compact with ourselves [or
is it, after all, between us and the state]?
<P>
If we can describe what is to come, we can show what is to be
done.  In addition, policy change is taking place in Washington,
in state legislatures, indeed, in governments around the world,
as policymakers attempt to understand the consequences of the
move from an analog to a digital world and its impact on regulatory
policy.  PFF is actively involved in the telecommunications debate,
focusing on the next generation of deregulation.

<td valign="top" width="20%">The talk in Washington is all about the end of the old party system.
 Not FDR's grand coalition (already dead!), but the two parties
themselves, the party system itself, seems to be unraveling. 
Are rebel voters, renegade factions, and brash new parties just
perturbations on an historical continuum? Or is the Old Order
really tottering?  And if it goes, what rises to take its place?
<P>
From where does all this voter anger arise?  Why do they feel
so alienated from their government?  The current structure of
the Federal government - centralized, bureaucratic decision making
in Washington to solve the nation's problems - came to the fore
in the 1930s and has reigned supreme ever since.  Until today.
 What type of governmental structures are needed for the 21st
century?  Is it time to replace the industrial state?

Surgical Lasers!  Genetic Engineering!  Molecular Transports!
 Surgery in Cyberspace!  Civilization is poised to make major
strides in medicine and health.  These advances have the potential
to dramatically increase both life spans and the quality of life,
while at the same time reducing the cost of health care.
<P>
Yet America's enjoyment of these benefits is threatened because
every day the current system for approving new medical technology
stays in place is another day Americans die needless deaths and
suffer senseless pain.   Why is that many of our drug and medical
device companies are able to offer products to patients in Europe
years before they ever receive FDA approval to do in the USA?
 How do we speed the approval process while ensuring safety? 
Who should pay for all this?  Is it time to replace the FDA?

are using right now is consuming power that costs you money on
your electricity bill every month - costs that have the potential
to be reduced significantly with sound reform.  Electric energy
is huge; the United States is home to nearly 1/3 of the installed
electric generating capacity in the world.
<P>
Why does the Federal government own some of it?  And why is it
regulated in a way to make a Soviet bureaucrat proud?  Should you - and
could you - choose the source of your power just like you choose
your long-distance company?  The Japanese are building tons of
it, the French have a flourishing industry in it, but in America
the nuclear energy industry is dying.<h4><a href="nrglink.html">Why?</a></h4>

America is undergoing a transformation as profound as the Industrial
Revolution.  Our work, leisure, education, warfare &#133; our
conceptions about society itself are all changing.  Revolution
is an over used word these days, but we are experiencing one.
Revolutions are messy; they often get violent, and unless we have
a sense of where we want to go we may end up in a place we don't
want to be.
<P>
Yet no one in the Imperial City wants to talk about Big Change.
 We are hampered by having lived most of our lives in a stable
political world where Revolution just didn't happened.  But it's

<P><h2>Mission Statement</h2></center>
<p>
Progress is the belief that Mankind has advanced in the past, is presently
advancing, and will continue to advance through the foreseeable future.<p>

No idea is more American, no idea has played a more central role in the
development of Western, and more recently, American Civilization. No idea is more
important to our collective future, and no idea has suffered more from the
cultural nihilism of the past 30 years than the idea of progress.<p>

America's Founding Fathers were unwavering disciples of the idea of progress<p>

But theirs' was a special brand of progress. They understood history, to borrow
Hegel's words, as "none other than the progress of the consciousness of freedom,"
and they placed their own concept of freedom at the heart of the American
Declaration -- in the "self-evident" proposition that "all men are created equal;
that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that
among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness."<p>

From John Adams, who wrote that the American Revolution occurred first "in the
hearts and minds of the people," to G.K. Chesterton ("America is the only nation
in the world founded on a creed") to Margaret Thatcher ("No other nation has been
built upon and idea"), it has always been clear that America's identity
transcends geography and ethnicity. Historians have devoted thousands of pages to
explaining our nation's history as the history of her ideas, and if we can be
certain of one thing, it is that America's future will be determined by the
future of her ideas.<p>

The challenge we face is to describe for ourselves and our progeny the historical
underpinnings, economic principles, cultural mores and practical implications of
the next incarnation of the American Idea. We will be judged by our sons and
daughters on our success at renewing, reapplying and passing on the core values
of the American Creed.<p>

That explains the mission of The Progress & Freedom Foundation: To restore, to
renew and to recreate America's sense of its future, a future woven inextricably
with the ideas of progress and freedom. It has been said that "The best way to
predict the future is to create it." Creating ideas that will define America's
future is what the Foundation has set about to do since its inception in April
1993.<p>

The Foundation is a private, non-profit, non-partisan idea center organized under
<a href="http://www.ustreas.gov/treasury/bureaus/irs/irs.html">Section 501(c)(3)</a> of the Internal Revenue Code.
<p>
"The views expressed here are solely those of the authors and do not
necessarily represent the views of the Board, Officers or Staff of The
Progress & Freedom Foundation."

<br>

Each month, <a href="/townhall/FRC/whois/bauer.html">Gary L. 
Bauer</a>, President of the Family Research Council, writes a letter 
to the friends of FRC that highlights a current topic, analyzes a key 
family issue, or describes an ongoing or new activity of the Council. 
These personal letters both describe the FRC President's perspective 
on the most pressing family issues and chronicle the development of 
FRC projects and programs to address those issues. These letters give 
friends of FRC an inside, in-depth look at the Council's work.

          An economist from the Joint Committee on Taxation
          believes that the Hall-Rabushka proposal would not be
          revenue-neutral, as claimed, but would instead reduce

Paul, Ron. 1982.  "The Flatter the Better?"  <i>Inquiry</i> (September),

<blockquote>
          Prominent libertarian (he was the Libertarian Party's
          presidential candidate in 1984) strongly favors a flat-
rate tax because "it would spread the burden of paying
          for government more evenly, foreclosing once and for
          all the illusion that the burden can be placed on the
          shoulders of the rich.  By shifting the tax burden
          toward the political center, any flat-rate tax would
          increase pressure for less government taxing and
          spending."  Contrast with Rothbard.

<b><a href="http://www.heritage.org/heritage/taxcut"><i>Why America Needs a Tax Cut</i></a></b>,   Foreword by Steve Forbes, edited by Angela M. Antonelli and Christianna L. Shortridge. (October, 1996) 
<p>
Lower taxes followed by sweeping tax reform is a recipe for renewal. This book should arm American taxpayers with the information they need to spread the word about the benefits of a pro-growth tax policy.

<b><a href="http://www.heritage.org/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1091.html">Backgrounder #1091,</a> <i>The Case for Repealing the Estate Tax,</i></b> by William W. Beach (August 21, 1996)<p> 
   "Virtually from the beginning of government in human society, death and taxes have been closely linked as well as inevitable. The passing of well-to-do individuals has been a lucrative moment for tax collectors. Most nations today impose death, estate, and inheritance taxes, and the United States is no exception." In this careful analysis of the short and long-term effects of estate taxes in the United States, Beach demonstrates the negative impact of such taxes from both an economic and a philisophically liberal position.  Warning that the apparently minor significance of the tax makes it easy and dangerous to overlook, Beach sees its repeal as a source of a better economy, more jobs, and higher wages.

<b><a href="http://www.heritage.org/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1090.html">Backgrounder #1090,</a> <i>How to Measure the Revenue Impact of Changes in Tax Rates,</i></b> by Daniel J. Mitchell (August 9, 1996) <p>
One of the most important fiscal policy debates developing in the 1996 election involves the question of whether changes in tax policy have "supply-side" effects. In other words, will lower tax rates increase economic growth, resulting in more jobs, higher wages, and bigger profits?  Using decades of empirical evidence, Mitchell explains why government officials should take such economic variables into account when determining the budgetary effects of tax reductions. 
<p>

<b><a href="http://www.heritage.org/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1086.html">Backgrounder #1086,</a> <i>The Historical Lessons of Lower Tax Rates,</i></b> by Daniel J. Mitchell (July 19, 1996) <p>
Economic evidence proves that when tax rates are reduced, the economy prospers, tax revenues grow, and lower-income citizens bear a lower share of the tax burden. Examining three decades--the 1920s, the 1960s, and the 1980s--Mitchell shows how tax policy can affect the economy and the Treasury, and provides suggestions for changes to tax policies in the 1990s.

Comparing the two dominant schools of thought on the causes of economic growth, Mitchell examines whether a balanced budget or a lower tax rate will achieve greater economic response. The lecture analyzes the impact of a flat tax on economic growth and investment.

This report examines the effects of the 1993 federal budget plan, and uses an economic model to measure the "Clinton Crunch," a combination of higher tax rates and lower real wages. The study shows how the Clinton economic plan resulted in slower growth as compared with previous economic expansions.

Government taxation and spending have reached intrusive levels in our economy and personal lives. The best way to solve the problem, the panelists argue, is to enact a flat tax that reduces the tax burden on workers and businesses, while restricting Congress's ability to take money out of the economy. Additionally, by limiting government spending and enacting laws requiring a two-thirds supermajority vote to raise taxes, Congress would go a long way toward alleviating the fiscal burden the federal government places on citizens.

Examines <a href="http://rs9.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d104:h.j.res.00159:">House Joint Resolution 159</a>, the  proposed Constitutional Amendment requiring a two-thirds supermajority for Congress to raise taxes, scheduled for a vote in the House of Representatives on April 15.

<p>
A widely quoted analysis of the economic effects of the flat tax on housing prices shows a 15% drop in housing values. That study's methodology, however, is seriously flawed. This Heritage econometric analysis shows a 7% to 14 % increase in home values.

<p>
Presents eight features of a flat tax that one would assume to fit the liberal agenda.  Income-based charts show the equality and effectiveness of a flat tax, illustrating how rich taxpayers would pay more in taxes and people who make less than $30,000 would pay no federal tax.

<p>
Examines the problems with the current tax system and compares it to a number of tax reform proposals including the Army-Shelby flat tax, the Specter flat tax, the Value-added tax, the National Sales Tax, the Nunn-Domenici USA tax, and the Gephardt 10 percent tax.

</HEAD>
<BODY background="/townhall/background.jpg" BGCOLOR="#ffffff">
<blockquote>
<center><H2>THE 1996 REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION</CENTER></H2>
<BR>
 Although the Founding Fathers warned against partisan party politics, US political history has taken a different course.  Partisan strife has evolved from the 1790's with the Anti-Federalists vs. the Federalists to the the current day two party division.  National nominating <a href="http://www.rnc.org/convention/history.html">conventions</a> 
have historically been the clearest demonstration and showcase of party politics and they continue to be a staple in American politics even today.  Political conventions, held by numerous parties beginning in the 1820's and 30's, underscored the fervent party politics of the past and created the traditions we witness every fourth summer.  <p>
In 1856, after only two years in existence, the Republican Party held its first nominating national convention in Philadelphia.  Since that time the Republican National Convention has grown from a delegate count of 600 to approximately. 2500 and attracted the interest of the public and media along the way.  This year's GOP faithfuls will arrive in San Diego, CA for the <a href="http://www.rnc.org/convention">1996 Republican National Convention</a> (Aug. 12-15) and, as expected, debate the key issues in the campaign in the hopes of creating a successful winning platform for the nominee.  Come the 15th the balloons will be on the ground, the money will have been spent and the reporters will go home, but the candidate and the platform which depart the San Diego Convention Center victorious will serve as historical reminders of this important political tradition.<p>
The convention, throughout the years, has provided an opportunity to define the GOP, and at times change the course of its ideological direction.	In 1964 the convention nominated arch-conservative Barry Goldwater, and despite his loss in the general election, spearheaded the influx of conservatives into the national political sphere and culture.  This, some say, contributed to the careers of many prominent conservatives and the the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980.  Speeches, of course, are the main centers of attraction at the convention and they have historically done the most to altar the direction of the party.  From Lincoln to Buchanan, the words said at the podium have left an everlasting impression at each convention since 1856. <p>  
The main issues this year center around familiar areas of debate: abortion, taxes, education and  a host of other economic and social concerns.  The question still remains whether a conservative agenda will arise as the dominate ideology in the platform. Recently, conservatives in the GOP have been fighting for a traditional GOP platform, one which is sensitive to the changing times as well as preserving core conservative values.  Only the results of the convention will tell which direction the Republican party is heading.  <p>

<center><h2>On The Job in D.C.</h2></center>

<p><br><b>What To Expect</b><br>
Working in Washington in D.C. as an intern is not glamorous. Interns 
invariably get the jobs that no one else in the office wants; that's why 
they hire interns. Licking postage stamps, sorting diskettes, running 
errands, and other sometimes monotonous activities are par for the 
course.
<table><tr>
<td>

</td><td>
<center><h3>Important Mindless Skills To Cultivate</h3>
</center>
<ul>
<li>photo-copying
<li>faxing
<li>delivering messages 
<li>stuffing envelopes
<li>filing
<li>kissing up to the boss
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><i>How the rest of the employees view interns.</i></td></tr></table>

<HR>
<p>Fortunately, there are brief moments of interesting activities 
interspersed between the doldrums. Be careful to not discount activities
that may be beneficial in gaining more responsibility; doing a poor
job on one task does not recommend you to more interesting activities.
Not everyone can make policy decisions or author position papers.
If your job is kind of boring to start just live with it; things will improve.
<p>
The office staff will most likely enjoy having some one around to do the grunt 
work, but do not expect them to invite you out to lunch. Watch and learn are intern 
necessities; on the job training is a fundamental feature of an internship. Make sure 
you pick up skills from co-workers; sometimes there is a much easier process for accomplishing mindless tasks.

<h3>Ten Worst Washinton D.C. <br>Intern Positions</h3>

<li>Accountant for Al D'Amato

<img src="simp.gif" align="left">

<b>Caveats</b><br>
<ol>
<li>Be on time- The only thing worse than D.C. traffic in the mornings is D.C. 
traffic in the evenings. Allow a time cushion or face the consequences. 
<li>Dress nicely- Unlike in Seattle, grunge is not regarded as a viable
fashion option in D.C.
<li>Don't whine- Interns willingly enlist in peonage for the summer; 
the bottom rung on the ladder is not the place for grandstanding.
<li>Be respectful- Especially to people who you don't know. It's not always obvious 
who's a big shot. (example: Who in their right mind in 1990 would have thought Slick Willie would become President?)

<blockquote> 
Scandal and corruption in politics has become, unfortunately, something that the public has grown accustomed to.  However, even the numbest and most cynical citizens have been overwhelmed by the criminal activities of the unscrupulous Clinton White House.  From Whitewater, to Travel-Gate, to the recent discovery of the misuse of FBI files, the American public has been witness to a seemingly endless stream of information concerning the illegal escapades of the Clinton administration.<p>  
Because the onslaught of information has been so relentless, so complicated, we here at Town Hall thought it might be useful to present a list of Clinton personnel who have been accused or convicted of wrong doing.  The following is exactly that, with especially bad little monkeys being marked with a banana next to their names.<p>
The information for this spotlight was provided courtesy of <a href="http://dolphin.gulf.net">Washington Weekly</a>, an Internet publication dedicated to presenting both unbiased news and boldly conservative editorials.  Our special thanks go out to them for their help on this project.<center><p>

<H2><CENTER>Internet Law and the Communications Decency Act</CENTER></H2>



<h5>[<a href="/townhall/spotlights/6-13-96/welcome.html.cgi/textonly">Text Only</a>]</h5>

<p>
<blockquote>
The first blow against government control of the Internet was struck on Wednesday, June 12, when a three judge panel in Philadelphia unanimously ruled that the <a href="http://www.seamless.com/rcl/iplaw/decact.html">Communications Decency Act</a> was in violation of the First Amendment.  The case could go to the Supreme Court as soon as next fall, if the Justice Department decides to appeal, and it is clear that this issue will not be decided in any definitive way until it is adjudicated upon by the highest court in the land. 
<p>
The controversy began when the White House signed the <a href="http://www.technologylaw.com/techlaw/act.html">Telecommunications Bill of 1996</a> on February 8 of this year.  Included as an addendum was the Communications Decency Act, sponsored by <a href="http://www.senate.gov/senator/exon.html">Senator Exon</a> (D-Nebraska), which formally restricts "indecent" material transmitted on the Internet.  This material is specifically defined by the Act as "any comment, request, suggestion, proposal, image, or other communication which is obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, or indecent, with intent to annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass."  This issue united both sides of congress and passed by an overwhelming majority in both the House and the Senate.  
<p>
However, despite the apparently clear cut nature of the issue in the minds of the members of congress, a number of people were outraged by the passage of the Act.  Internet, free speech, and human rights groups began immediately protesting and filing <a href="http://ruby.ils.unc.edu/~koyam/lawsuit.html">lawsuits</a>.  A number of Internet users altered their Web pages, changing their backgrounds to black, or displaying blue ribbons, as a sign of protest and solidarity.  Congress heard testimony from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/corpinfo/bill-g.htm">Bill Gates</a>, representatives of the <a href="http://www.aclu.org">ACLU</a>, and others, but were unswayed by the arguments against censorship.
<p> 
And that is what this issue is really all about.  Do the citizens of the United States really want the government to intervene on their behalf and protect them from things that they shouldn't see?  The issue is further complicated by the fact that the Act was intended to protect the many children who utilize the Internet daily, and because of the extreme obscenity of the material available on the Internet.  People have been divided along the traditional lines of the First Amendment debate: those who feel the right to free "speech" must be protected above all else, and those who feel that they have a right and a duty to control the disbursement of material which they find to be grossly offensive.  Obviously, this is a complex issue with powerful arguments being made by both sides, but as it stands, those opposing censorship have won the first battle of what looks to be a long and grueling war over the valuable territory of Cyberspace.

<h2>The Minimum Wage and Election-Year Politics</h2>
</center>


<h5>






[ <a href="/townhall/spotlights/6-12-96/welcome.html.cgi/textonly">Text Only</a> ]<p>


</h5>



<P>With House passage of the minimum wage bill (HR 1227) two weeks ago, the Democrats have proven successful in their attempts to find their voice for the upcoming '96 elections.  Although the Democrats had the opportunity to raise the minimum wage when they were in the majority during the first two years of the Clinton presidency, they chose not to.  They knew that the increase does more harm than good for the poor working families they claim to represent.  But now, with the elections a few months away, it is time to play politics by blaming American businesses and gaining favor with voters.  The Democrats have managed to dredge up one of their favorite liberal pet issues in the minimum wage debate.</p>

<p>On May 23, House Republicans stood divided over the minimum wage issue.  As reported by <i>Congressional Quarterly</i>, the final vote was 281-144 for a bill that increases the federal minimum wage from $4.25 to $4.75 an hour effective July 1, and then to $5.15 an hour a year later.  In all, this is a 21% increase in the wage.  Ninety-three Republicans broke ranks with the conservative House leadership to vote with 187 Democrats in agreement with the measure.  The debate on this issue is not over; this week the bill goes to the more deliberative Senate.  Nothing would please the Democrats more than to have this issue alive up until the November elections.</p>

<p>Why does an increase in the minimum wage hurt American workers more than it is intended to help?  Conservatives refer to prominent economic studies which, according to the <a href="/sbsc/">Small Business Survival Committee</a>, continually conclude that increasing the minimum wage has a direct result in the decrease of the number of entry-level employment opportunities.  "The General Accounting Office, the 
<a href="http://www.brook.edu/">Brookings Institution</a>, the Employment Policies Institute Foundation, the Congressional Budget Office and 
various presidential commission's have all reached this universal conclusion," reports the <a href="/sbsc/">Small Business Survival Committee.</a></p>

<p><a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation's</a> Mark Wilson points out several reasons why the "emotionally appealing" arguments for an increase in the minimum wage are misleading.  For one, increasing the wage will raise the price of consumer goods and eliminate over 200,000 entry-level jobs by 1999.  In addition, a higher wage does not help low income households on the whole, when you consider that over one-half of those individuals who earn the minimum wage are teenagers and spouses living in well-to-do families.  What's more, an increased minimum wage fails to help poor working families when, "of the 23.5 million Americans in poor families, just over 2 percent are working and paid $4.25 an hour."</p>  

<p>Conservatives take a different approach toward raising the level of take home pay for all American workers.  That is, getting the government out of the way of small businesses in terms of the excessive taxes, regulations, and mandates which hamper productivity and growth.  Mark Wilson lists items of the conservative policy: "cut payroll taxes . . . cut the capital gains tax . . . balance the budget . . . increase the skills of the future work force . . . increase the skills of the current work force . . . and enact regulatory reform."  These measures remove the burdensome barriers currently faced by small businesses, allowing them to accomplish extraordinary things in contributing to a robust economy.</p>

<H2> Getting an Internship in Washington, DC </H2>

<p>

So you want to be an intern in Washington, DC?  The key to having an enjoyable internship experience is finding one in an area that you are interested in.  A genuine interest in the work of your office will enable you to maintain your sanity while executing many mundane tasks.  In this spotlight, I will give some pointers on why anyone would ever consider interning and how to go about finding a position that you will enjoy.  These are not just tips from a creative mind, but from an intern here at <a href="/townhall/">Town Hall</a>.  This summer marks my third internship experience, so I figure I'm qualified to give advice on this matter.  Looking back, I realize how much I have benefited from my experiences and how little I knew about finding a position when I first got started.  I hope that you will find this information beneficial.

<p>Interning can be an immeasurable benefit to an academic and vocational development.  Whether an internship involving an area related to your academic concentration, or just an interesting diversion, it can give you experience and contacts for future job searches.  At the same time, you will be able to see how the real world works.  Your experience may guide you along your educational trail or abruptly halt it and point you in the opposite direction, but the more you find out about the job market the better off you will be. <p>


<img src= "/townhall/spotlights/interns/6-7-96/dollar3.gif" align="left" alt="hundred dollar bill">


While enhancing your education greatly, most internships will hurt you financially.  I would estimate that nearly three out of every four internships are unpaid, particularly in Washington, DC.  And many of the paid positions will not provide enough income to cover your living expenses.  To make matters worse, the internships that are paid are also the most competitive.  Long story short, nobody gets rich interning.  It's an investment in the future; down the road, the financial toll of your internship experience will be rewarded with a well paid job.<p>

There are ways to ease the financial burden.  One of the most popular is to find friends or family in the Washington, DC area.  Not only will your housing expenses disappear, you should be able to mooch numerous meals.  There are also scholarship opportunities out there for those in need; so search them out.  Also, there are many free meal opportunities in the District.  Keep your eyes open for receptions with food.  They're everywhere, just look for them. <p>


<img src= "/townhall/spotlights/interns/6-7-96/library2.gif" align="right" alt="generic library scene">


If you are willing to put the time in to looking for an internship, there will almost certainly be one that suits your interest.  Washington, DC is ripe with internship opportunities in every field of interest.  The most difficult part is getting started.  I found that searching for what's available was the easiest way to start.  Finding the opportunities that are available will motivate you to put together the necessary paper work.  There are many places to look:

<p> <ul> <li>Who do you know?  Family and friends are often the best sources of internship opportunities.  Figure out who you know and where they work.

<li>There are <a href="http://www.carleton.edu/campus/career/bibliography.html">books</a> which list internship opportunities.  I recommend Peterson's Guide to Internships. 

<li>Keep an eye out for internship opportunities in magazines and newspapers.  Check the classifieds.

<li>Look into the <a href="http://www.american.edu/other.depts/washsem_worldcaps/">American University Internship Program</a> for a summer in Washington, DC.  For a fee, they will help you find a place to work, provide you with housing, and usually you will be able to get course credit.

<li>Go to your career center at school.  Most schools provide some kind of assistance for finding internships.  Be careful not to limit yourself to what your school recommends.  There are many more opportunities available than just what your school will point you towards.

<li>Search the web.  There are numerous sources out there.  I found a few, but this is not a comprehensive list.
<a href="http://www.fga.com/twc/intern.html">The Washington Center</a>, 
<a href="/heritage/intern_program/intern.html">The Heritage Foundation</a>,
<a href="http://www.med.ufl.edu/oihp/students/intern.html">National Council for International Health</a>,
<a href="http://www.tvjobs.com/intern.htm">Radio and Television Internship Opportunities</a>,
<a href="http://www.si.edu/youandsi/ofgfel.htm">The Smithsonian Institution Opportunities</a>,
<a href="http://www.americanexpress.com/student/moneypit/getjob/intern/intern.html">American Express University</a>,
<a href="/discovery/educate.html">The Discovery Institute</a>,
<a href="/conservative/intern.html">American Conservative Union</a>,
<a href="/lead-inst/eps.html">The Leadership Institute</a></ul>

It is essential to apply to several internships that you are interested in, as the competition is fierce, especially in the summer.

<p>Once you have composed a list of internship opportunities that you would like, you are ready to put together the necessary materials.  At the very least you will need a <a href="/townhall/spotlights/interns/6-7-96/resume.html">resume</a> and <a href="/townhall/spotlights/interns/6-7-96/coverltr.html">cover letter</a>.  The key to a good resume and cover letter is to distinguish yourself.  Emphasize any experiences, accomplishments, leadership positions, etc. that will set you apart.  In addition, if you are applying to different types of positions you may want to emphasize different experiences and accomplishments accordingly.

<p>You will often be asked to submit additional information, such as a transcript, writing samples, recommendations, and applications.  Recommendations can be very helpful, depending on who writes them.  This is partly luck, but try to find someone that has a talent for emphasizing and/or creating your special talents.  In a writing sample, look for something that relates to the work of the office you are interested in.  In addition, originality is good.  These people will see many writing samples, make yours stand out.  Keep in mind it doesn't have to be a paper, I found that brochures and advertisements I created for a previous job worked well.  The key is to make your materials as personal as possible.  It is important to give the impression that you are putting a lot of effort into the materials you send.  The process can be time consuming and frustrating.  However, it is definitely worth the effort.

<p>After you have submitted all the necessary materials, you may be contacted for an interview.  Interviews are a nerve-racking experience for most people.  The key is to be yourself.  After all, the purpose of the interview is for your potential employer to get to know you.  At the same time, keep in mind what they want to here.  Do the little things that can impress them.  Pay attention to name, highlight experiences that relate to the work they have described, and anything else that will help.  It may take some practice to figure out what to do.  To get a start, try this <a href="http://www.kaplan.com/career/hotseat/"> practice interview</a>.


<p>Good luck with your internship search.  If you have any questions feel free to <a href="mailto:njg9b@virginia.edu">email </a> me.

<H2>Medicare: The Sequel</H2>
</center>



<h5>[ <a href="/townhall/spotlights/6-4-96/welcome.html.cgi/textonly">Text Only</a> ]</h5>







<blockquote>

<P>On Wednesday, June fifth, the battle over Medicare will begin
anew.  On that day, the Medicare trustees are expected to release
a report showing that Medicare is going broke even faster than
was reported last year.  This means that a solution to the Medicare
dilemma is more urgent than ever.

<P>We are all aware of the bitter fight that occurred last summer
over Medicare.  Led by the <A HREF="http://www.aarp.org">AARP</A>,
the <A HREF="http://www.whitehouse.gov">Clinton Administration</A>
and the <A HREF="http://aflcio.org">AFL-CIO</A>, a media scare-campaign
was conducted, the likes of which had never been seen before.  Recently 
on C-Span, House Speaker <A HREF="http://www.house.gov/mbr_dir/GA06.html">
Newt Gingrich</A> declared that Medicare ads designed to scare 
85-year olds were and are despicable.  And that is just what these
groups tried to do: scare the elderly away from the reform proposals
of the Republicans.

<P>What these great defenders of the elderly neglected to mention was the
fact that when Medicare goes bankrupt, no one will have Medicare.  Instead,
liberals lied atrociously, claiming that a Republican-proposed 6.7% growth
in Medicare per year was actually a draconian cut that would starve the
elderly, and was proposed in order to pay for tax breaks for the rich.  
Eventually, the terror efforts were successful: although Congress succeeded
in passing <A HREF="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/L?d104:./list/
d104sh.lst:341[341-342](Medicare_Preservation_Act_of_1995">Medicare Reform
</A>, Clinton vetoed it.  Even <A HREF="http://www.washingtonpost.com">The 
Washington Post</A> lamented that nothing would be done to help save the 
entitlement program.

<P>The arguments wont change this time around.  John Sweeney, president of
the AFL-CIO, has already launched a 35 million dollar campaign and a <A HREF=
"http://www.townhall.com/townhall/spotlights/6-3-96">"union summer"</A> 
against Republicans.  Adding Republican support of Medicare Reform to his 
list of complaints would suit him fine.  And the AARP receives so much funding
from the federal government (to the tune of seventy-six million dollars)
that swatting down Republican efforts can be done with what must seem to 
them spare change.  

<P>But we cannot let them win this time.

<P>The reforms that Republicans are proposing would substantially improve
the current Medicare system.  Perhaps most important would be granting 
recipients of Medicare the option of choosing from either private plans or
the government program.  Another important reform would be altering the way
benefits from Medicare are distributed: rather than an open-ended system 
which delivers a certain set of benefits, the new program would send a 
defined amount of money in the form of a voucher to recipients, that they
might spend the money as they chose.  Both of these measures would allow 
for greater consumer choice and, through competition, reduce the costs of 
Medicare without reducing the quality of services provided.

<P>For the sake of both the elderly today and the elderly tomorrow, we cannot
lose this fight. Regardless of the political consequences, be they good or
bad, our politicians are called first to serve this nation: they must ignore
the PAC scare-campaigns and enact solutions to our most important problems.
Caving in on Medicare would be a sign of a nations leaders adrift in 
extraordinary political impotence.

<h2>The AFL-CIOs "Union Summer"</h2>
</center>



<h5>[ <a href="/townhall/spotlights/6-3-96/welcome.html.cgi/textonly"> Text Only</a> ]</h5>








<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Big labor is on the move this summer.  On Saturday, June 1, the <a href="http://www.aflcio.org">AFL-CIO</a> is kicking off 
their <a href="http://www.aflcio.org/usummer">"Union Summer"</a> campaign.  The program involves young workers and college students who will organize union campaigns and direct liberal political efforts.  To help workers find their "voice" against "todays profit-crazed corporations," Union Summer 
participants will work in locations around the country to raise support for their cause.</p>  

<p>This activist program represents the labor unions' latest efforts in attacking corporate 
America and feeding misinformation to honest, hard-working Americans.  In the past few 
weeks, the labor unions rolled out an aggressive ad campaign which supported an 
increase in the minimum wage.  The campaign was directed toward House Republicans in 
districts with high union membership.  With the House passage of the minimum wage a 
few weeks ago, these attack ads had a direct impact on the outcome.</p>  

<p>In her article entitled, <a href="http://www.townhall.com/townhall/columnists/schlafly/schl030796.html">"Looking Out for Union Politicking in Congressional Campaigns,"</a> Phyllis Schlafly, president of Eagle Forum, has followed the union tactics and how the AFL-CIO plans to spend $35 million on an ad campaign "to defeat 75 Republican Congressmen in the 1996 November elections."  This amount of money spent on advertising is seven times more than is regularly spent in federal elections.  An <a href="http://www.townhall.com/townhall/columnists/duplantier/dupl032596.html">F.R. Duplantier column</a> provides further insights into the unions heavy investment in ad campaigns for the upcoming elections.</p>     

<p>The good news is that some television stations across the country have either refused to 
air or eventually pulled the advertisements from their rotation, according to the National 
Republican Congressional Committee.  In one instance, on May 25, the Evansville 
Courier reported how the WEVV-44 television station canceled AFL-CIO commercials 
which criticized US Rep. John Hostettler because the ads were false, accusing the 
Congressman "of cutting Medicare and student loans."  Skip Simms, WEVV-44 general 
manager, said, "We felt the statement in the ad was not true, therefore we pulled it.  The 
information the AFL-CIO provided us to support the statement was pretty weak."  Other 
freshman Republican Congressmen who have been on the unions "hit list" include 
Edward Whitfield (KY), Todd Tiahrt (KS), James Longley Jr.(ME), Jon Christensen (NE), and 
Randy Tate (WA).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.townhall.com/sbsc/">The Small Business Survival Committee</a> (SBSC) has written extensively on other tactics and strategies of the labor unions (i.e. Republican attack ads, mismanagement of union 
dues).  The May 23 issue of SBSCs <a href="http://www.townhall.com/sbsc/laborwatch/lw-14.html">Labor Watch</a> covers how the National Education Association (NEA) and the American Federation of Teachers just finished their strategy session, setting a liberal legislative agenda for the 96 elections.  According to Labor Watch, the NEAs tax-and-spend policies would "increase the size of government by nearly 40%; . . . most of the issues on their list have little or nothing to do with education."</p>  

<p>According to <a href="http://www.townhall.com/abb/">Americans for a Balanced Budget</a> (ABB), AFL-CIOs president, John Sweeney, fails to represent his rank-and-file members in the union.  In a <a href="http://www.townhall.com/abb/pr/043096.html">poll Frank Luntz 
conducted for ABB</a>, union members overwhelmingly were in favor of Medical Savings Accounts, a balanced budget, and tax cuts.  Sweeneys blatant disregard for the views of the rank-and-file members illustrates his "leftward views and desire to return the Congress back to Democrat control."<p/>

<p>Whats alarming about Union Summer is that the AFL-CIO is now getting young people involved in their misinformation campaign.  According to AFL-CIO president Sweeney, he will use 1,000 young workers and college students to build the new grassroots campaign by having them "planning, phone calling, door knocking, organizing, and demonstrating."  <a href="http://www.townhall.com/sbsc/laborwatch/lw-11.html">Labor Watch</a> reports their movement will focus on "minimum wage fights at the state and local level, and agitating against the California Civil Rights Institute."  The students involved will work three weeks at a time, receiving "training, free housing, and a stipend of $210 a week."</p>

<title>Memorial Day Spotlight</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<h2><b><center>Memorial Day Spotlight</center></b></h2>
<br>
<p>On the last Monday of May, Americans celebrate Memorial Day, honoring 
those who have died for this great nation while serving in combat.  The holiday 
began in 1868, when <a href="http://suvcw.org/logan.htm">General Order No. 11</a> was promulgated by <a href="http://www.outfitters.com/illinois/history/civil/john_logan.html">General John Logan</a>, commanding that May 30th would be a day for "strewing with 
flowers or otherwise decorating the graves of comrades who died in defense of 
their country."
<br>
<p>Although begun as an honor primarily for Union Soldiers who died in the 
Civil War, this holiday, initially called "Decoration Day," was recognized by both 
North and South on the last day of Monday by the end of World War I.  The 
holiday eventually spread to include the fallen of all wars, and became known 
with time as Memorial Day.
<br>
<p>Even though a certain contemporary president may only wish to invoke 
military status when threatened with a lawsuit, there are others in the nation's 
capitol-- both Democrats and Republicans-- who have served our nation in a 
more honorable way.  The story of <a href="http://aspin.asu.edu/~pctp/mccain/mccain.html">John McCain's</a> five years as a prisoner of war and <a href="http://www.dole96.com">Bob Dole's</a>  
wounding in a raid against the Germans in northern Italy in 1945 serve as 
inspiring reminders of the lengths we must go to, should our nation beckon.  
Other veterans of the U.S. wars of our include <a href="http://www.house.gov/samjohnson/welcome.html">Representative Sam Johnson of 
Texas</a>, <a href="http://www.senate.gov/~stevens">Senator Ted Stevens of 
Alaska</a>, and <a href="http://www.senate.gov/~kerry">Senator Kerry of Nebraska</a>.
<br>
<p>In the words of General John Logan, "let us, then, at the time appointed, 
gather around their sacred remains and garland the passionless mounds above 
them with choicest flowers of springtime; let us raise above them the dear old 
flag they saved from dishonor... if other eyes should grow dull and other hands 
slack, and other hearts cold in solemn trust, ours shall keep it well as long as the 
light and warmth of life remains in us."

<center><h2>CAREERS: Nothing to Strive For</h2></center>
<p>
<p>
<hr>
 <p> 		             

A growing number of state legislators are voicing their opposition to <a href="http://www.house.gov/eeo/status_bills.html">H.R. 1617</a>, known as the <b>CAREERS</b> bill, which would expand and make permanent the School-to-Work Act passed by Congress in 1994. <p>

In a letter to House Speaker Newt Gingrich and the Missouri Republican delegation, 
Missouri legislators said that <a href="http://www.house.gov/eeo/status_bills.html">H.R. 1617</a> "incorporates word-for-word many sections of Goals 2000, include the <b>removal of local control from education</b> and the <b>centralization of power to the federal government</b> including the need for approval from the Department of <a href="http://www.dol.gov">Labor</a> and <a href="http://www.ed.gov/">Education</a> for a state's proposal to grant money. <p>

"The terms used in the acts are of concern as they refer to items such as a 'skills certificate' which children would be required to earn and which employers would be encouraged to require as a condition of employment.<p>

"Finally, a myraid of new agencies, department, and programs are created...and it appears that a <b>large, centralized, nationwide data collection system</b> will be put in place." <p>

<a href="/townhall/FRC/">The Family Research Council</a> has also expressed concern on behalf of thousands of families across the country. <p>

In a recent <i>Alert</i>, Family Research Council elaborated on the provisions it found unacceptable:
<ul>
<li><b>The inclusion of youth in a seamless system of workforce development</b>.  
The needs of youth are much different from those of an unemployed adult.  Vocational education should be a matter left to the local control of elected boards, not merged into a complex new workforce development infrastructure.
<p>
<li><b>The creation of a workforce development infrastructure</b>.  The CAREERS bill requires the creation of state and local workforce development baords that will oversee all aspects of the "seamless system" of workforce development.  These boards will be appointed, <i>not</i> elected.  
<p>
<li><b>The Labor Market Information System (LMIS)</b>. This system has the potential to collect data on every American employer, worker and student.  Proponents of the bill rationalize LMIS by claiming the need for jobseekers to be able to access information on job openings across the country.  Why should the government duplicate information already provided by trade associations, business journals, and classified ads everywhere?

<br><H2>Kickoff to Campaign '96: The Nomination Process Begins</CENTER></H2>

<br>
This week Town Hall presents a look at the upcoming caucuses and primaries that will play a central role in determining who will be the 1996 Republican Party presidential nominee. A front-runner will soon emerge with a tidal wave of support that should carry him all the way to the GOP convention in San Diego, and to the White House. Past experience has shown that success in these early events is critical to launching a successful bid for the nomination.<P>
For instance, no Republican candidate has has won the party's nomination in nearly a half-century without first winning the New Hampshire primary. The quick pace of the primary season is even quicker this year with the changes in the Louisianna caucus and the Delaware primary dates, and many of the pundits believe that the race will be over by mid March. The Town Hall spotlight shines some light on the small, yet pivotal caucuses and primaries of February.

<br><H2>The Balanced Budget: Will We Ever See It?</CENTER></H2>

Balancing the Budget is a priority of the conservative revolution that swept through Congress in 1994, but so far, the President has impeded the budget process with his vetos.  What could have been done by conservatives in just a few weeks, is now turning into a year long process.  Some pundits are even now predicting that Clinton won't make a deal and take the issue to the voters in November.<P>
Town Hall will keep up on the details and bring them to you as they happen in the Budget Spotlight. Check here often more the lastest news, polls, and opinion as the nation debates the balanced budget.

The Food and Drug Administration was created in 1906 to protect Americans from unsafe food and drugs, but over the years, burdensome FDA regulations have slowed the approval process for many breakthrough medical treatments.  This session, the Congress is beginning to address these concerns and FDA reform is beginning to take shape.  Follow the Spotlight this week as we look at what the FDA does and why it should be reformed.

<h2>Education: A Conservative Primer <br>
</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
This week Town Hall is pleased to bring you an exclusive spotlight on education in America.  
<p>
Everyone agrees that the success of the tomorrow's Americans is dependant on a good education today; however, the type of education is an ongoing debate between liberals and conservatives.
<p>
No one disagrees that educational progress in the last thirty years is embarrassing.  Low test scores and rankings as compared to other countries, poor discipline in the classroom and violence in school have been the results of liberal ideology on the school system.  Instead of focusing on the immediate purpose of primary education--educating our youth in history, mathematics, social science, and language-- enlightened members of academia have determined that diversity, multicultural curriculum, and self-esteem programs represent the true focus of the American educational experience.  
<p>
What is the solution? Well, in Town Hall's exclusive spotlight this week, you'll discover that leading conservative organizations have developed numerous programs to combat the current state of American education.  Along with raising standards and restoring a sense of order and discipline in the classroom, other policies include school choice, market-based reform, and privatization.  Best of all, these policies are now the central components of the ongoing debate, which is a victory in itself for conservatives.

<h2>Presidential Candidate Spotlight</h2>
</center>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
February is only a few months away and politicians are once again flocking to New Hampshire in hopes of capturing the all important first primary of the presidential race. Currently there are 9 GOP candidates in the race, all participating in the ideological labeling which takes place before the issues control the campaign.  With nine candidates, it is difficult to remember who they are and what they stand for.<p>
This spotlight summarizes the candidtaes in question and relays a portion of their ideology and stance on the political spectrum.

<title>TH Spotlight on Leader:  Congressman Dick Armey</title>

<h2><i>TH Spotlight on The Leader</i></h2>
</center>
Some say that true statesmanship is dead in America.  But sometimes there is an exception to the rule.  Whether championing the flat-tax proposal, writing his book, "The Freedom Revolution" or pushing the <i>Contract with America</i> through Congress, Representative Dick Armey is a true leader.  Consistently advancing the ideas of Ronald Reagan -- less government, more freedom, lower taxes and strong families -- Armey is in the vanguard of the "conservative revolution."
<p>
This week's Town Hall Spotlight focuses on the first Republican Majority Leader since 1954.  Town Hall has selected the speeches which get to the core of Armey's philosophy.  Bashing the "arrogant political order," and declaring that now is "not a moment for the timid,"  Armey is paving the way towards a true "Freedom Revolution."  Find out why Empower America's Vin Weber describes him as, "a one-man think tank in cowboy boot."

<br>
8/7/95
<br>
<br>
	I had a problem this week.  With the Waco and Whitewater Hearings, the tax debate, Medicare negotiations, and Bosnia going on, I couldn't decide what I should write.  After spending a solid 5 minutes thinking, I decided to write about Town Hall's new programming schedule.<p>

	Starting Monday, August 7, Town Hall will implement a new programming schedule.  The first component is entitled the <b>Spotlight</b>. A new one will appear each Monday and will focus on an issue, event, organization, or person.  After reading a Spotlight, you will be able to enter a special Forum where you can debate the issues with other Town Hall users.  (It is still under construction so please use the regular Forum to discuss this week's topic.  Look for the one with the <b> Spotlight/Flat Tax</b> title.  <a href="/townhall/hotissues/welcome.html.cgi"> (Click here to jump to the Forum page</a>) <p>
 <A HREF="/townhall/spotlights/i-flatx.html">This week's Spotlight</A> focuses on tax reform.  The Armey-Shelby flat tax plan, the Archer sales tax plan, and Dick Gephardt's 10 percent tax plan are presented, while <a href="/townhall/atr/1.html">Americans for Tax Reform</a>'s Grover Norquist, <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a>'s Dan Mitchell, and other tax analysts examine the pros and cons of each plan.  Look for a new book from the <a href="/townhall/sbsc">Small Business Survival Committee</a>'s Raymond Keating to be available through the Town Hall shop in the coming weeks.<p>

	Town Hall will begin to expand our programming next week with news summaries, a daily what's new, polls, surveys, games, etc.  Use the <a href="/townhall/cyber_personth/cyberper.htm">Ask Tom</a> link to suggest other information or activities that you would like to see on Town Hall.<p>

	I hope that you enjoy our inaugural Spotlight on Tax Reform!  Don't forget to go to the <a href="/townhall/hotissues/welcome.html.cgi">Forum</a> to let everyone in Town Hall know what you think about the issue.<p>

<title>Hot Issues -- Travelgate -- ACU</title>
</head>
<body>
<center><h2>Hot issues<p>Travelgate</h2><br><p></center>
The following letter, from ACU Chairman David A. Keene, was delivered to the United States Senate on September 11, 1996.
<p>
Dear Senator:<p>
On behalf of the one million members and supporters of the American Conservative Union, I urge you to oppose the Levin-Biden amendment to the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill during floor considerations today.<p>
The Levin-Biden amendment would strike the provision providing for financial restitution for Billy Dale, the former head of the White House Travel Office, on the grounds that the measure is a private relief bill.
<p>
But that is not the case.  A private relief bill is legislation that, among other things, names a specific individual who will receive a benefit.  The Treasury-Postal bill contains no such specific reference.  The provision in question merely notes that its purpose is to provide restitution for the wrongly-fired former employees of the White House Travel Office.<p>
What's really going on here is that Senate liberals are trying to get Bill Clinton off the hook.  If they succeed in striking this provision, given the crush of legislative business remaining to be done in the few short weeks before the planned adjournment, Mr. Dale will have to wait until the next Congress to have his legal bills -- now in excess of $500,000 -- paid.  That's just not right.<p>
It wasn't right for Mr. Clinton to fire Mr. Dale in the first place.  It wasn't right for Mr. Dale to be accused and indicted.  It wasn't right for the White House to look over his FBI file seven months <i>after</i> they had fired him.  It wasn't right that Mr. Clinton -- even after a jury acquitted Mr. Dale on all counts in less than two hours, after a two-week trial -- continued to remind the public that Mr. Dale had once considered agreeing to a guilty plea.<p>
And it's not right that Senators Levin and Biden want to protect the president from having to sign this provision into law.<p>
Billy Dale was an innocent man, unjustly accused, who watched his world crumble around him -- all for the sake of political spoils.  His reputation was besmirched, his family humiliated, his integrity challenged.  You can't repair the emotional damage the Clinton White House has inflicted on this man and his family.  But you can help him get one step closer to being financially whole again.  Defeat Levin-Biden, and return to Billy Dale at the very least the money that was taken from him.<p>
Yours Sincerely,<p>
David A. Keene<br>
Chairman<p>

                    The following letter from ACU Chairman, David Keene, was sent to the United States House ofRepresentatives on March 27, 1996:             <P>                  Dear Representative: <P>       On behalf of the one million members and supporters of the American Conservative Union, I urge        you to support HR 1833, the partial birth abortion ban, when it comes to the floor today for a        vote.      <P>          As you know, this bill passed the House last November, and then passed the Senate with slight        modifications.  By passing the Senate version of the legislation today, you will bypass the needfor        a conference committee and send the bill directly to the president's desk.      <P>          One Senate amendment allows the procedure in cases where it is necessary to save the life of the        mother.  And another Senate amendment shifts the burden of proof to prosecutors to demonstrate        that the abortionist had other options available to save the life of the mother (whereas the original        House language had placed the burden of proof on the abortionist to demonstrate that he or she        had no other option).                We believe the Senate amendments are acceptable, and do not deviate from the basic thrust of the        bill:  to prohibit the grisly practice of beginning the delivery of a baby, only to stop when the        baby's head is still inside the mother so as to facilitate killing it.         <P>       Surely a nation as civilized as ours believes itself to be will not tolerate this ghastly activity.                That the pro-abortion lobby has rallied so vociferously against this legislation -- even prompting a        veto threat from the White House -- reveals better than words just how deep is their commitment        to the abortion cause and industry, and shows who are the true "radical extremists" in this policy        debate.                <P>                      Yours sincerely,                          <P>                                    David A.

The following letter from ACU Chairman, David Keene, was sent to the United States House ofRepresentatives on March 28, 1996:                                     <P>                              Dear Representative:     <P>  On behalf of the one million members and supporters of the American Conservative Union, I urge        you to support HR 3103, the "Health Coverage Availability and Affordability Act of 1996,"        during floor consideration today and tomorrow.      <P>          As you know, this bill is a combination of three separate bills -- HR 3103, HR 3070, and HR 995        -- that went through the Ways and Means, Commerce, and Economic Opportunities Committees,        respectively, and was melded together by the Rules Committee yesterday.  <P>              For three years now, as one of the largest grass-roots groups lobbying on the issue of health care        reform, we have held fast to a set of principles for dealing with health care reform.  They are:<P>                1)     Expanding coverage through portability, done on a group-to-group basis;      <P>  2)     Expanding coverage for individuals through encouraging states to create risk pools   for        persons with pre-existing medical conditions;     <P>      3)    Expanding coverage through the creation of Medical Savings Accounts;     <P>      4)     Reducing costs through the imposition of limits on medical malpractice lawsuits;       <P>    5)     Reducing costs through an increase in the deduction for self-employed workers.          <P>      HR 3103 deals with health insurance reform in a reasonable and limited fashion, in a manner        based on several of these principles.  The legislation would provide for portability of health        insurance coverage on a group-to-group basis; would increase the deduction for self-employed        individuals from 30 to 50 percent; would limit medical malpractice claims, a much-neededchange        that would make health insurance more affordable by lowering insurance premiums for healthcare        providers; would encourage, through tax policy, the creation of state-level high-risk pools; and        would authorize MSAs, a provision which conservatives have supported for years as the only        long-term solution of the health insurance problem.      <P>             We can tell you:  this legislation addresses the problems in the health care delivery system in a        limited, reasonable way, and should garner the support of all those wishing to correct somecurrent        inadequacies in the system without allowing for a government take-over of the industry.                     <P>                    Yours sincerely,                  <P>                       David A.

 The following letter was sent from ACU Chairman, David Keene, to the United States Senate on March 27, 1996:   <P>
                                                  Dear Senator:          <P>      On behalf of the one million members and supporters of the American Conservative Union, I urge        you to oppose the Kennedy-Wellstone amendment to raise the minimum wage.            <P>    Economists of all stripes agree that the minimum wage has but one guaranteed effect -- to make        job creation more difficult for those small businesses that are the engine of job growth inAmerica,        and to thereby make getting a job more difficult for those seeking entry-level positions.        <P>        Given that our economy has performed anemically over the last several years -- a direct result of        federal government policies which include burdensome regulations, high taxes, and wasteful        spending programs that take otherwise productive dollars out of the private economy and putthem        into unproductive dollars in the public sector economy -- this hardly seems the right time to be        considering raising the costs of offering a job to a prospective employee.      <P>          Could it be that there's something else going on here?  Perhaps a transparent political payoff toBig        Labor, whose bosses just this week endorsed Bill Clinton for reelection -- the earliest-ever        endorsement by the unions of a candidate for the office?  When you take that into consideration,        and add to it the fact that the AFL-CIO bosses also announced this week their plans to raise an        additional $35 million war chest to target 75 House Republicans (combined with their expected        $400 million in-kind donations to Democratic candidates in this fall's elections), one begins to see        a pattern emerging.      <P>          Don't fall for it.  The minimum wage is a job-killer.  At a time when we need to be creating more        new jobs, not less, don't make it more difficult for small businesses to do so.  Reject union boss        pressure and stay firmly on the side of those millions of workers looking for entry-level positions.     <P>                                 Yours sincerely,    <P>                                                          David A.

<hr>The following letter from ACU Chairman David Keene was delivered to Congress on March 14, 1996:<br>                 
        <p>
     
        Dear Congressman:<br>
        <p>
        On behalf of the more than one million members and supporters of the American
        Conservative Union, I urge you to support HR 2703, &quot;The Effective Death Penalty and
        Public Safety Act of 1996.&quot;<p>
        
        We believe the bill was strengthened by the passage yesterday of the amendment offered
        by Rep. Barr of Georgia.  No longer do we have to fear the U.S. government infringing
        on the constitutional protections of our citizens through wire-tapping crusades conducted
        willy-nilly, and no longer do we have to fear being charged with a crime for selling
        perfectly legal property which may or may not later be used in the commission of a crime.<p>
        
        Don't believe the liberal media, which has reported that the Barr amendment &quot;gutted&quot; or
        &quot;eviscerated&quot; the legislation.  It did not.  It strengthened it, by ensuring that in our desires
        to crack down on crime and terrorism, we are not gutting the constitutional rights of
        American citizens.<p>
        
        I urge you to vote &quot;yes&quot; on HR 2703.<p>

<h2>Hot Issues<p>
Welfare Reform</h2>
<br>
Friday, March 22, 1996
<p>
</center>



<hr>The following letter from ACU Chairman David Keene was delivered to Congress on March 
5, 1996:<br>                 
        <p>
        
        Dear Congressman:<br>
<p>        
        On behalf of the more than one million members and supporters of the American
        Conservative Union, I urge you to support legislation embodying the welfare compromise
        crafted by the National Governors Association.<p>
        
        We believe that, alone of all the possible welfare reform alternatives, the NGA proposal
        passes two critical tests:  it ends the entitlement status of welfare (a reform for which
        conservatives have been fighting for years), and it remains true to the principles of
        federalism (for which conservatives have been fighting for decades).<p>
        
        We understand that several of the leading social conservative groups oppose the NGA
        reform.  As we understand their argument, their opposition to the NGA proposal is
        primarily based on the fact that it doesn't mandate a family cap as established in HR 4.<p>
        
        While it is undeniably true that allowing states to set their own family caps is not as certain
        a method for seeing to their adoption nation-wide as would be mandating a federal family
        cap, it is also undeniably true that 13 states already have enacted family caps on their own,
        and another seven have already applied for the necessary federal waivers to do so.  We
        believe that more and more states would adopt them as their success was demonstrated in
        the states that have taken the lead already.  This is the essence of federalism.<p>
        
        Moreover, the NGA proposal was adopted unanimously at its early February meeting. 
        Why should a Republican-controlled Congress have a problem agreeing to a proposal
        supported by 50 state governors, most of whom are Republicans?  Isn't the essence of
        conservative government the notion that government governs best which governs closest to
        the people?<p>
        
        As Speaker Gingrich said more than a year ago, conservative micromanagement from
        Washington is just as bad as liberal micromanagement from Washington.<p>
        
        Although it is doubtful that President Clinton would sign the NGA compromise -- and it is
        not even necessary to send him a bill -- it is important for the GOP House to go on record
        supporting a proposal supported by all Democratic governors.  The NGA proposal does
        achieve the over-riding strategic goal of welfare reform:  ending the entitlement status of
        the programs, and returning power to the states.  I urge you to support the NGA proposal.<p>
        

<pre>
                              Yours sincerely,
        
        
                              David A. Keene
                                  Chairman

<h2>Hot Issues<p>
Product Liability Reform</h2>
<br>
Friday, March 22, 1996
<p>
</center>



<hr>The following letter from ACU Chairman David Keene was delivered to the United State Senate on March 
18, 1996:<br>                 
        <p>
     
       
        Dear Senator:<br>
<p>        
        On behalf of the more than one million members and supporters of the American
        Conservative Union, I'm writing today to urge you to vote for cloture tomorrow on the
        product liability conference report, and then to support its final passage.<p>
        
        America's current product liability laws are abused by lawyers seeking to make a &quot;fast
        buck&quot; and so-called consumer organizations seeking to shift blame from consumers to
        others with deep pockets.  The result is to drive up prices, make insurance unaffordable,
        and generally to deprive the public of many products which, when used as the directions
        suggest, are beneficial.<p>
        
        Trial lawyers have argued for years against meaningful reform of product liability laws, on
        the grounds that such changes would make consumers vulnerable to the wishes of so-called
        &quot;rapacious&quot; and &quot;greedy&quot; corporations.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The
        product liability laws, when amended, would allow those truly to hurt to seek redress.  But
        they would let those of us who do want to buy products, and use them responsibly, to do
        so.<p>
        
        Vote for cloture tomorrow on this important legislation.  And support when it comes to a
        final passage vote.  America's consumers will thank you.<p>
        
           
        <p>

                                Yours sincerely,

<h2>Hot Issues<p>
Small Business Deregulation</h2>
<br>
Friday, March 22, 1996
<p>
</center>



<hr>The following letter from ACU Chairman David Keene was delivered to the United State Senate on March 
18, 1996:<br>                 
        <p>
        
        Dear Senator:<br>
        <p>
        On behalf of the more than one million members and supporters of the American
        Conservative Union, I urge you to support S. 942, the small business deregulation bill,
        when it comes to the floor tomorrow.<P>
        
        For far too long, America's small businesses -- the engines of economic growth -- have
        been laboring under a stultifying myriad of regulations, increasing the costs of doing
        business and making difficult the creation of new jobs so vital to the growth of our
        economy.<p>
        
        The bill's specific provisions, we believe, are eminently reasonable, and simply make
        common sense.  Waive fines for first-time offenders if the violations are corrected within a
        reasonable time period.  Let small businesses recoup their legal expenses if they win a
        challenge against excessive enforcement of existing regulations.  And give Congress a 45-day window 
        in which to review and reject newly-issued rules.<p>
        
        Support S. 942 tomorrow.  America's millions of small business owners -- and the people
        who want to work for them -- will be watching.<p>

   
 <PRE>
                             Yours sincerely,

<hr>The following letter from ACU Chairman David Keene was delivered to Congress on March 18, 1996:<br>                
        
        <p>
        Dear Congressman:<BR>
        <P>
        On behalf of the more than one million members and supporters of the American
        Conservative Union, I urge you to support H.Con.Res. 148 when it comes to the floor
        tomorrow.<P>
        
        The United States must send a clear message that it will not stand aside while tyrants bully
        a peaceful, prosperous, pro-American neighbor.<P> 
        
        H.Con.Res. 148 expresses the sense of Congress that the United States should demand that
        the Peoples Republic of China (PRC) live up to its prior promises to resolve differences
        with the Republic of China on Taiwan (ROC) by peaceful means, and that the United
        States should assist in the ROC's defense if the PRC attacks.<P>
        
        For decades, the PRC has relentlessly striven to isolate the ROC from the world
        community. Despite the mainland regime's mean-spirited policy, the ROC is an important,
        influential participant in international affairs. It is one of the few rising democracies in
        East Asia, promoting and protecting economic, political and individual liberty. The ROC's
        national legislature and virtually all provincial and municipal officials are chosen by direct
        popular vote in free elections. This month, for the first time in China's long history, a
        direct popular election for president will occur. The ROC's political and economic
        progress is a textbook model of what bipartisan U.S. policy has always encouraged the
        world over.<P>
        
        Both the PRC and ROC agree that there should be one unified China. Each has long
        claimed to be China's sole legitimate government, but only the ROC has taken positive
        steps toward compromise. It conducts itself under a &QUOT;one China, two governments&QUOT; policy
        while working to resolve other differences case-by-case. Regrettably, recent events again
        underscore the fact that peace derives from strength and only constant pressure and resolve
        make untrustworthy Communists abide by their agreements.<P>
                 
        The Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 does not obligate the U. S. to assist the ROC should it
        become a victim of aggression. H.Con.Res. 148 can be an important step toward
        clarifying ambiguity and focusing the moral and political imperatives for U.S. policy. The
        choice is clear: if ever there was a stark case of &QUOT;good guys&QUOT; and &QUOT;bad guys,&QUOT; this is it. <P>
               
    <p>

<h3>A GUIDE TO KASSEBAUM-KENNEDY</h3>

By John C. Liu<br>
Policy Analyst<br>

Issue Bulletin No. 222<br>
March 22, 1996<br>

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Both houses of Congress soon will consider sweeping legislation affecting the way millions of Americans get their health insurance. In the Senate, the chief sponsors of the Health Insurance Reform Act of 1995 (S. 1028) are Senators Nancy Kassebaum (R-KS) and Edward Kennedy (D-MA).<sup>1</sup>  In the House, Representative Dennis Hastert (R-IL) is coordinating the efforts to introduce an improved version of the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill.<sup>2</sup>  Both bills are intended to address a recurring and legitimate concern among millions of working Americans who currently have employment-based health insurance:  the threat of losing private health insurance when they lose or change their jobs, or try to obtain coverage when they have a pre-existing medical condition. But while the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill contains some useful provisions, it also contains serious flaws -- many of which would be corrected by incorporating language based on the House proposal.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Anxiety about health insurance coverage stems from the very nature of today's employment-based system. Typically, workers and their dependents are covered by an employer-based health insurance policy only as long as they remain with the same employer, and for just a short time afterwards. If a worker is laid off or takes a job with a different employer, the family may encounter pre-existing condition exclusions or different health care providers. If the worker joins a firm with no group insurance plan and buys his own coverage, he receives no tax breaks for purchasing that policy -- compared with generous tax relief if an employer obtains and owns the coverage. Lawmakers thus need to address two fundamental problems in trying to fix the broken health insurance market: 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>1.)</b> Health insurance is the only type of insurance tied to the place of employment. Other major forms of insurance such as homeowners, mortgage, and life are not normally tied to a worker's place of employment. The reason health insurance is employer-based today is that federal tax relief for insurance is available only to workers who obtain insurance through their place of work. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>2.)</b> The tax code effectively limits workers and their families to only one type of insurance option:  employer-based health insurance. Insurance market reforms do not resolve this underlying problem with a distorted health insurance market.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Kassebaum-Kennedy bill (S. 1028), as reported out of committee, is flawed legislation. While S. 1028 avoids the price controls and huge tax increases found in both the Clinton plan and other bills introduced in the last Congress, it contains vague provisions for federal regulation of the health insurance market, a responsibility traditionally left to the states. S. 1028 gives the Secretary of Health and Human Services disturbingly broad powers in this area.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Instead of just trying to guarantee Americans the right to purchase health insurance, Congress should take careful steps to make sure that Americans of all incomes, health status, and employment status have the ability to buy into the health care market.<sup>3</sup>  Therefore, Congress should focus on:
<p><ul>
<li> Group to group portability;<p>
<li> Limiting pre-existing condition exclusions upon losing employer-based coverage;<p>
<li> Reasonable mechanisms to allow small employers and legitimate associations to pool together to get better prices;<p>
<li> Tax equity for individuals and families seeking health insurance outside an employer setting; and<P>
<li> Full income tax deductibility for the self-employed increased to 100 percent.
</ul> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In his 1996 State of the Union message, President Bill Clinton emphasized that the goal of S. 1028 is to end the loss of portable health insurance among millions of workers and their dependents.<sup>4</sup>  The issue of portability of insurance is a broad concern among Republicans and Democrats alike. S. 1028 is a well-intentioned attempt to address it, as well as the problem of pre-existing conditions. The bill also makes improvements in the areas of guaranteed availability and portability of group coverage. Unfortunately, for jurisdictional and procedural reasons, Senate rules have prevented the addition of several key health care reform components necessary to allow individuals, rather than the companies they work for, to own their health insurance policies. If it is Congress's intention to give workers and their families true portability of health insurance, lawmakers must correct the inherent flaws and inequities that are the unintended consequences of an inequitable federal tax code that penalizes the working poor and self-employed.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Thus, even though the Senate measure does contain extensive federal regulation of the individual health insurance market, intended to address portability, it lacks the key financial incentive to persuade healthy individuals to purchase health insurance in a timely fashion. Unless Congress is willing to address the core problem of today's health insurance system -- the federal tax code -- health insurance reform will fall far short of its goals.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The widespread fear of losing employment-based health insurance emerged as the driving force behind the health care debate during the 103rd Congress. An analysis of the March 1994 Current Population Survey showed that 55.3 percent of the uninsured population in 1993 were uninsured because they had lost their jobs or changed jobs.<sup>5</sup>  That insecurity stems from the design of today's employer-based health insurance system, itself the product of perverse incentives created by the federal tax code.<sup>6</sup>  Others worry about not having any form of insurance from their current employer.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The best way to achieve portability is to give Americans ownership and control of the financing of health benefits. Where appropriate, financial assistance should be given to low-income working families to help pay for basic care in the form of vouchers or tax credits. If individuals and families are allowed to comparison shop among a variety of health plans and benefit levels offered through their employer, a private organization, or an individual policy, costs can be controlled. True portability also can be achieved, because Americans will no longer face the possibility of losing their health insurance based on a change in job, loss of job, or pre-existing condition. 

<p>
<b>WHAT S. 1028 WOULD DO</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Kassebaum-Kennedy bill would create a uniform federal standard for health insurance that is intended to increase the portability of private health insurance policies. Under the legislation, individuals with employment-based health insurance would be able to maintain coverage while changing jobs. In the area of group coverage, the bill would reduce the length of exclusions for pre-existing conditions by crediting enrollees for maintaining continuous coverage through a previous employer. Furthermore, insurers and employers would be prevented from excluding employees from an employer's group health plan based on their medical status or experience.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The proposal also would create a new state-based system of health plan purchasing cooperatives (HPPCs) intended to give small businesses and individuals greater purchasing power in negotiating more favorable rates from insurance carriers and other health plan providers.

<p>
<b>A Limit on Pre-Existing Conditions</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Kassebaum-Kennedy bill places a restriction on the ability of health plans and employers to limit or deny coverage in group health insurance plans to 12 months for medical conditions diagnosed in the previous 6 months. A time credit is applied against the preexisting condition period by reducing it one month for each month that a worker and his dependents were continuously covered under a previous group health plan. In addition, the bill:
<P><ul>
<li> Places a ban on further preexisting condition exclusions by any insurer once a worker has been continuously insured for a minimum of 12 months. Thus, workers who change jobs or insurance plans would no longer be subject to waiting periods.
<p>
<li> Prohibits health plans and employers from canceling or providing coverage to any employee in the employer group plan based on a preexisting condition or health status.
<p>
<li> Promotes wellness programs by allowing employers and group health plans to provide discounts to employees who participate in activities (approved by state insurance regulators) designed to promote healthy behavior, prevent or delay the onset of illness, or provide for screening or early detection of an illness.
</ul> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The guaranteed availability and renewability of health insurance in S. 1028 would alleviate the portability problem facing workers who want to change jobs. This is a welcome and long-overdue improvement in today's health insurance market.
<P>

<b>Group Purchasing Arrangements (Health Plan Purchasing Cooperatives)</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
S. 1028 attempts to make health insurance more affordable for small employers and self-employed workers by enabling them to purchase coverage as part of a larger group. The rationale is that small businesses generally pay higher per capita premiums than larger businesses because they lack economies of scale and the power to bargain. Under current law, when an employee or dependent incurs expensive claims, typically the employer's premiums increase sharply the following year, in many cases pricing that group out of the insurance market. The danger to the worker and his family occurs when a health plan provider drops the small employer from coverage, or the employer excludes the particular employee from the group plan due to his previous year's claims experience.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The bill attempts to correct this problem by promoting small group purchasing arrangements. Referred to as Health Plan Purchasing Cooperatives (HPPCs), they are private, voluntary coalitions/alliances developed to purchase health insurance and negotiate with providers and health plans. State laws prohibiting the formation of such HPPCs are preempted. Under the bill, HPPCs would require state certification and would have to be registered with the U.S. Department of Labor. In addition to purchasing insured products on behalf of members, HPPCs would not be permitted to bear risk,<sup>7</sup> although they would be given discretion in determining the eligibility requirements for employers and whether or not to include individuals -- as long as the individual's health status is not a factor.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To facilitate the formation of HPPCs, and to get them to be active participants in the health insurance market, S. 1028 provides for a limited preemption of state insurance rating laws with respect to group health plans and individual health plans offered by health insurance carriers through HPPCs.<sup>8</sup>  Health plans purchased through other avenues, however, would remain subject to state small group rating requirements, which require carriers to pool all small group businesses for rating purposes. Thus, the Senate bill creates different rules for different insurance arrangements.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>An Uneven Playing Field.</b> By exempting HPPCs from state small employer group rating laws, Congress would be creating an incentive for small businesses with healthier than average employees to seek out coverage under a HPPC that has procured rate discounts:  Businesses could do this on any basis other than the health status and demographics of the HPPC's members. But there is a significant problem:  Without the premium payments from these healthy employer groups, others seeking coverage through non-HPPC arrangements could face higher than normal rates in a pool dominated by unhealthy employer groups. The Senate bill, in other words, could end up compounding the market distortions in a sector already distorted by an inequitable federal tax code. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Unfortunately, the legislative language creating HPPCs would lead to an uneven playing field against commercial insurance companies not selling products through HPPCs. While insurance premiums in the non-HPPC market no doubt would be higher than those in the HPPCs as a result of this provision, it is not definite how severe the impact would be. Congress would be wise to ensure that an even playing field exists in the health insurance market so that competition among health plan providers is fair. At a minimum, Congress should amend S. 1028 so that all health plans, whether issued through a HPPC or though a non-HPPC, are exempted from state rating requirements. Members of Congress should not worsen the distortions in health insurance markets through federal legislation.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Some in Congress have expressed an interest in enacting a blanket federal preemption of any state-mandated benefit laws that would apply solely to HPPCs. State-mandated benefit laws have added to the cost of insurance, rendering policies unaffordable for many small businesses and individuals. While it is perfectly understandable that Members would want to protect small businesses and individuals purchasing insurance through a HPPC from burdensome and costly state mandates, any preemption of state mandated benefit laws, however well-intentioned, should be applied to all forms of health coverage, HPPCs and non-HPPCs alike. A better approach would be to preempt state laws which:
<P><ul>
<li> Require health insurance policies to cover specific diseases, services, or providers;<P>
<li> Limit the ability of managed care plans to contract selectively with health care providers; or<p>
<li> Limit the ability of managed care plans to impose higher cost-sharing provisions on treatment obtained from providers outside a plan's network.<sup>9</sup>
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Lower premiums are a desirable goal. However, it would be extremely unwise of Congress to distort the health insurance market further by placing HPPC plans at a marketing advantage over non-HPPC plans. As drafted, the potential for HPPCs' gaining monopoly status is very real because of the legislative language creating these new entities. Although not theoretically exclusive, as under the Clinton health plan, these geographically based HPPCs might become the exclusive means for individuals and employers to obtain fully insured health coverage, if premium rates negotiated by the HPPC are less than those otherwise permitted under state law.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In this respect, Members of Congress should recall the ill-fated "managed competition" legislation introduced in 1994 by former Congressmen Jim Cooper (D-TN) and Fred Grandy (R-IA).<sup>10</sup>  Among other things, this health insurance reform proposal also would have established state-based health insurance purchasing cooperatives.<sup>11</sup>  While individual and family enrollment in these HPPCs supposedly would have been voluntary, the regulatory infrastructure and tax code revisions set up in the Cooper-Grandy plan eventually would have forced small businesses and individuals into such entities. Consistent with the managed competition model in the Cooper-Grandy plan, HPPCs under S. 1028 would be required to enroll all employers and individuals within a geographic area as determined by the state. If S. 1028 were enacted into law as reported out of the Senate Labor Committee, the combination of new federal rules with existing state insurance rules could make employee enrollment in HPPCs the only practical choice for insurance coverage. Workers and their families therefore would lose a large measure of personal choice in health plans.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Most significantly, current ERISA regulations do not prohibit states from establishing voluntary purchasing cooperatives.<sup>12</sup>  Congress should not create a regulatory infrastructure that could establish the groundwork for making such HPPCs mandatory within a state. The danger is that the instability created by the federally designed HPPCs would lead to further federal regulation to "correct" the problem -- resulting in still further problems. The result:  Congress, by degrees, would create a system of purchasing cooperatives similar to those found in the Clinton Health Security Act, which required every American to obtain health insurance through these alliances.

<p>
<b>Group-to-Individual Coverage</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;S. 1028 does take some of the first steps needed to construct a consumer-based health insurance framework -- even though other provisions conflict with this goal. Subtitle B does this by setting up an infrastructure to facilitate individual health plan portability. Insurance carriers that sell individual health plans are required to issue individual coverage when the following criteria have been met:
<p><ul>
<li> Individuals a) must have been covered previously under an employment-based health plan, b) must have paid health insurance premiums on a continuous basis without a gap in coverage of 30 days or more, and c) must have been covered for at least 18 months;<P>

<li> Individuals must not be eligible for coverage under an employee health benefit plan or group health plan, such as one offered by a new employer or by a parent's or spouse's employer;
<p>
<li> Individuals must have exhausted their eligibility for COBRA<sup>13</sup> continuation coverage (which is available for a minimum of 18 months to over 80 percent of individuals receiving employment-based coverage); and
<p>
<li> Individuals must not reside in a state which has adopted a high-risk pool or other means of covering individuals unable to maintain health coverage. 
</ul> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Guaranteed issue and the availability of insurance in the individual market are addressed by forbidding insurance carriers to determine coverage or establish eligibility, continuation, or enrollment requirements based on health status, medical condition, claims experience, or medical history. Without these rules governing the group-to-individual conversion, the portability of health insurance will not be achieved. Under current law, individuals switching from an employer who offers insurance coverage to an employer who does not offer coverage would simply lose this benefit.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The bill also puts rules in place for health insurance carriers to ensure their financial stability and solvency. An insurance carrier or other health plan provider offering coverage to individuals under an individual health plan may deny applicants if the health plan ceases to enroll any new individuals. A carrier also may do so if it can demonstrate to the state that its financial or provider capacity to serve previously covered individuals will be impaired if the state requires it to enroll additional individuals.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Concerns have been raised about how these provisions would affect premium costs.<sup>14</sup>  Some critics of S. 1028's group-to-individual portability provision say that insurance premiums in the individual market would increase sharply, perhaps in the range of 10 to 15 percent.<sup>15</sup>  But the American Academy of Actuaries, the national organization representing actuaries of all specialties in the United States, says the increase in premiums would be quite small, ranging between 2 and 5 percent.<sup>16</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Since S. 1028 does not impose strict community rating requirements, or otherwise impose price caps on the premiums that insurers may charge individuals,<sup>17</sup> some insurance executives, such as those with one of the leading insurance trade associations, fear that the guaranteed-issue requirement for individuals with prior coverage would "make individual health insurance unaffordable over time."<sup>18</sup>  This concern is premised upon two assumptions:  1) that only unhealthy individuals will purchase health insurance, thereby increasing the likelihood of adverse selection in the individual market; and 2) that absent significant public subsidies, healthy individuals will not purchase insurance before they need it.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Because both consumer choice and competition are frustrated in a health insurance system that is predominantly employment-based, these concerns about insurance costs in the individual market are legitimate in today's tax climate. Since health insurance is entirely optional, those who purchase health insurance on their own must pay the entire cost of the premiums with after-tax dollars. Thus, healthier than average individuals would be more likely to decline insurance in a voluntary market, while unhealthy persons could see an economic benefit in getting coverage. A guaranteed-issue requirement in the individual market would lead to higher premiums since unhealthy people would comprise a disproportionate share of the market. While concerns about rising premiums in the individual insurance market are justified, Congress can and should address this potential problem by providing consumers with financial assistance to help offset any possible increase.
<p>
<b>HOW CONGRESS CAN IMPROVE S. 1028</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill makes improvements in the existing health insurance system, there are several provisions which should be strengthened. Without further changes, the laudable intentions of this legislation will not be realized in good public policy. Millions of Americans are painfully aware of the weaknesses in the current system. The Senate Committee on Labor correctly diagnosed the problem:  "[M]illions of Americans are at risk of becoming uninsured or subject to preexisting condition exclusions under the current system because they change jobs, lose jobs, or work for employers who change insurance policies."<sup>19</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Certain key policy changes can improve insurance reform legislation and better achieve the goal of portability and security in health insurance. These changes, as proposed in the House legislation, include tax equity for non-employer-based health insurance, medical savings accounts (MSAs), increased deductibility for purchasing health insurance for the self-employed, a clarification of the ERISA laws making it easier for smaller employers and individuals to pool and gain leverage in the insurance market, and medical malpractice reforms.

<p>
<b>Tax Equity Would Offset Most Adverse Effects in the Individual Market </b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As noted, policy analysts and insurance industry executives have raised concerns over the effects that guaranteed issue and guaranteed renewability could have on premiums in the individual insurance market. Under the current system, unhealthy individuals leaving employment-based coverage find COBRA either the preferable or perhaps the only alternative to being uninsured. Healthy individuals have the luxury of making an economic decision to go with no coverage or purchase an individual-based policy with after-tax income. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To the extent that Members of Congress remain concerned about a potential increase in premiums, they should re-examine the core problem behind today's health insurance system -- the federal tax code. Congress should provide an incentive for healthy employees to enroll in the individual market by giving them tax equity. This means giving individuals who purchase their own health insurance policies the same tax treatment as workers who get their health insurance through their employers. As drafted, the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill would not help college graduates entering the job market for the first time who end up working for small start-up businesses unable to offer health insurance. To fix this problem, Members of Congress need to look no further than the health-related tax provisions passed overwhelmingly by both houses of Congress in the Balanced Budget Act of 1995. A majority of today's uninsured population is made up of the self-employed, those working for small firms, or young individuals. These groups are affected by the distortions in an employer-based health insurance system and are the ones typically suffering from the absence of portability and ownership.
<p>
<b> Introduce medical savings accounts (MSAs).</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
MSAs would enable group-to-individual conversions to have a widespread impact on today's uninsured population. While there are other comprehensive forms of tax equity Congress could consider (such as tax credits and 100 percent deductions for the self-employed), MSAs would be a good start. They would provide sufficient incentive for healthy individuals to purchase insurance, thereby creating a solid and solvent risk pool that offsets the claims of future unhealthy enrollees. MSAs could be constructed as passed earlier this Congress:
<P><ul>
	<li>	Contributions of up to $2,000 for individuals and $4,000 for families, including employer contributions, would be 100 percent deductible from adjusted gross income;
<p>
	<li>	Interest earned on the income would be subject to taxation;
<p>
	<li>	Withdrawals made for non-medical expenditures would be included in the individual's gross income and subject to a 10 percent tax prior to age 59-and-a-half;
<p>
	<li>	Upon reaching age 59-and-a-half, the individual could make withdrawals for any purpose without the 10 percent tax;
<p>
	<li>	In order for a health plan to be classified as such, at a minimum it would have to provide catastrophic coverage in which the minimum deductible for individuals is $1,500 and $3,000 for families.
<p></ul>
<b> Increase and expand tax deductions.</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Under current law, self-employed individuals are permitted to deduct 30 percent of the amount paid for health insurance for themselves and their dependents. While a 30 percent deduction provides some tax relief for the nation's self-employed, the federal tax code still provides significant tax advantages for employees by exempting company-sponsored benefits from any federal income or payroll taxes (FICA), as well as from state and local taxes. In addition to pre-existing condition exclusion barriers, the availability of this tax exclusion for workers is one of the major impediments facing employees seeking to leave and start their own businesses. Congress should remove this bias, and also encourage creation of a sound individual-based health insurance market, by increasing the deduction for health insurance of self-employed individuals and their families.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Earlier this year, Congress passed legislation which would have increased the 30 percent deduction to 50 percent between 1996 and 2002. This proposal was vetoed by President Clinton. While a 100 percent deduction would provide tax fairness for all individuals and the self-employed, even a compromise of 50 percent would represent substantial progress.
As a condition of regulating private insurance at the federal level, consider pre-empting state mandated benefit laws. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The health insurance industry is one of the most highly regulated sectors of the American economy. Before an insurance carrier or health plan provider is allowed to enter and do business within a state, it must satisfy a litany of state requirements and regulations. Regulation of health insurance is usually within the jurisdiction of the states, not the federal government. A key component of state regulation is the imposition of mandated benefits on insurance carriers licensed to do business within their jurisdictions. These mandates are the product of intense special-interest lobbying at the state level, where medical specialists, marriage and family counselors, therapists, and other professionals have succeeded in imposing coverage requirements. Over the years, the number and scope of these benefits have grown substantially, adding to the cost of insurance plans sold to employers and individuals. Nationwide, there are over 1,000 such state mandates, ranging from in vitro fertilization to chiropractic care and psychological counseling. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In principle, Congress should refrain from regulating health insurance at the federal level. But with S. 1028, Congress is doing precisely that, arguing that the weaknesses of the current insurance market (the absence of portability and the growing numbers of uninsured) outweigh adherence to the principles of federalism. If Congress decides to regulate the individual health insurance market, sponsors of S. 1028 should seek at least a net deregulation of the market by preempting state mandated benefit laws. In return for preemption, Congress may seek to require catastrophic coverage as a consumer protection measure. This would substantially reduce both the regulatory burden and the cost of insurance for small businesses which employ a majority of the uninsured population.
<p>
<b> Avoid a Clinton-style standardized benefits package.</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Congress should refrain from imposing any requirements that health plans cover a particular benefit, medical procedure, or service. Several Senators favor requiring health plans to cover specifically defined medical benefits. But while such a proposal is appealing on a superficial level, this approach guarantees higher costs and unintended long-term consequences. Like the Clinton plan, a standardized benefits package forces all individuals to buy benefits they neither want nor need. It does not take into account the different medical needs and desires of individuals and families. While some Americans may want and can afford the inclusion of comprehensive and expensive benefits, millions of others -- especially younger, less well off, and healthier individuals -- may not. If a worker or family member suffers from a particular disease that is not included in the standardized benefits package, that person could be medically worse off if the required extra service he needs is unaffordable.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Specific benefits invariably are required if a Hollywood movie star or celebrity is willing to take up the cause of persons with a particular disease, replete with an appropriately colored ribbon.<sup>20</sup>  During the debate over the Clinton health plan and its variants in 1994, congressional staff, Representatives, and Senators were inundated with office visits, mail, faxes, and phone calls asking that a particular benefit or service be covered. If the group of patients is large and powerful enough, perhaps with the aid of a celebrity, it is likely that the benefit will be added by Congress. Supporters of mandated benefits should be honest about the unintended consequences that come with a mandated benefits package -- higher premiums and the politicization of diseases.
<p>
<b> Do not remove "lifetime limits" from employer-sponsored health benefit plans.</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Some Members of Congress are considering a prohibition on "lifetime limit" provisions in private health insurance plans as a way to protect patients facing high medical expenses due to catastrophic illnesses. The danger is that such a rule would raise employers' health care costs. For some companies, the extra cost could be severe enough to prevent a plan from being offered or continued, thus exposing the patient to 100 percent of all medical bills, including catastrophic claims.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Lifetime limits are necessary to help private insurance companies meet solvency standards required by the states. The same principle already applies to government health programs. For example, the Medicare Hospital Insurance (HI) Part A Trust Fund imposes a lifetime limit on two major services:  hospitalization (150 days) and skilled nursing facility care (100 days). It is all but certain that if such a rule were applied to Medicare Part A, the Trust Fund would be insolvent long before the projected date of 2002.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;While studies have estimated the cost of eliminating lifetime caps would be an additional 2.3 percent for employers,<sup>21</sup> the findings do not take into account the added cost of prohibiting separate "inside limits" on specific categories of services already contained within existing policies. Without lifetime and inside limitations in health insurance policies, many small to mid-sized employers would be unable to purchase any type of health plan for their employees. As pointed out by the Association of Private Pension and Welfare Plans (APPWP), a majority of employer-based health benefit plans include "inside limits" on certain benefits and services:<sup>22</sup> 
<p><blockquote>
	The Standard Option benefit package offered to federal government employees enrolled in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) includes a limit of one hospital inpatient treatment program per lifetime for alcohol, drug, and substance abuse.
<p>
	The Segal Company's "1994 Survey of State Employee Health Benefit Plans" also reports that 35 states included "separate annual/lifetime maximums" for mental health and/or substance abuse treatment.
</blockquote><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The strongest cost argument in favor of outlawing lifetime limits is that average increases in premiums for employers would be modest. But the American Academy of Actuaries (AAA) has cited several consequences that make the removal of lifetime limitation provisions financially unattractive. One is the "[p]otential for increased health care inflation, potential pressure to liberalize limited benefit structures in public programs, and the potential impact on reinsurance companies and insurer premiums."<sup>23</sup>  Another unintended consequence of repealing lifetime limits would be the added cost taxpayers would be forced to bear for the approximately 18.2 million federal, state, and local government employees. A majority of health plans covering government employees already have lifetime limit provisions, and many also contain additional inside limits. While lifetime caps appear onerous, they give employers who voluntarily offer health benefit plans reason to believe that these plans will remain affordable.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Lifetime caps are but one health benefit design feature that allows employers to offer the level of benefits they can afford. During consideration of the Clinton plan, Congress and the American people rejected mandating the level of benefits that employers must provide to their employees. The issue of employer-provided health benefits is a matter best left to employers and employees. Private employers and employees, not Congress, should decide what level of benefits they can afford. Congress should avoid piecemeal additions to benefit packages based on pressure from health industry groups. If Congress bows to pressure from such groups, employers will be forced to scale back or drop the benefits they provide to accommodate a repeal of lifetime limits. Employees and their families will receive fewer benefits, and this will lead to calls for additional mandated benefits, further increasing health care costs. This unnecessary yet inevitable circle of events is sure to be triggered if Congress gets into the perennially unfinished business of benefit setting. 
<p>
<b> Consider medical malpractice reform.</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While there are federalism concerns involved in legislating malpractice reforms at the federal level, an urgent need exists to confront the liability problem. The federal government funds approximately half the nation's health care expenditures through Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans Administration, Indian, and Public Health programs; and medical malpractice and other liability costs, driven by pro-plaintiff state laws, have contributed to these already large costs. In fact, medical malpractice costs have contributed greatly to increased medical costs in both the public and private sectors.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In connection with medical malpractice litigation, the current legal system allows unlimited compensation for non-economic damages. Non-economic damages are separate from, and do not include compensation for, medical costs, rehabilitative costs, foregone wages, or other out-of-pocket expenses. During the first session of the 104th Congress, the House of Representatives passed legislation to limit non-economic damages associated with medical malpractice. Significant provisions of the reform included a $250,000 limit on non-economic damages and the option to pay future losses exceeding $50,000 in periodic increments. The Senate should carefully consider the House medical malpractice reform provisions while encouraging substantive reforms at the state level.
<p>
<b> Place no more power and control in the hands of the Secretary of Health and Human Services.</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Section 110 of S. 1028 requires insurance companies and other health plan issuers to guarantee issue coverage, without any exclusion of coverage for pre-existing conditions, to individuals who meet certain requirements related to prior group coverage. Section 111 requires guaranteed renewal of all individual health plans. Section 112 allows states to be exempt from the requirements of Sections 110 and 111 if, and only if, they have in place (or subsequently put in place) an alternative law or program that meets the same goals and is approved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In evaluating whether a state meets the goals, the Secretary of HHS is to evaluate state programs according to the four criteria:
<P>
1) Whether the state law or program provides coverage to individuals leaving group coverage;<p>
2) Whether the state law or program provides coverage for preexisting conditions for individuals leaving group coverage;<p>
3) Whether the state law or program provides individuals leaving group coverage with a choice of health plans or a health plan providing comprehensive coverage; and<p>

4) Whether requiring a state to comply with Sections 110 and 111 would have an adverse impact on the number of individuals in the state who have access to affordable health insurance coverage.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Among insurance experts, there is a wide range of estimates on how much premiums in the individual health insurance market actually would increase under S. 1028. Rather than mandate a single uniform approach, as called for in Section 112, Congress should allow the various states to experiment with alternative approaches and methods. States should determine for themselves the best way to guarantee continued availability of health coverage to their residents leaving the group market. To date, 11 states already have enacted guaranteed issue requirements in the individual market.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Section 112 vests enormous power in the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The Secretary, in effect, can disapprove legitimate state initiatives that address the problem of how to guarantee continuation of coverage for individuals and families. For instance, the Secretary could rule that state high-risk pools are not "affordable" because their premiums are higher than prevailing market rates, even though significant subsidies are required to cover the true costs of enrollees. Under this scenario, most states' high-risk pools could be found "unaffordable" and unacceptable to the Secretary.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Instead of allowing the Secretary to control how states regulate their individual insurance markets (a traditional state function), S. 1028 should allow the state insurance commissioner (or the official or officials designated by the state to enforce the goals of this legislation) to determine whether the alternative state law or program meets the goals of S. 1028. No review or approval by the Secretary of HHS should be required.
<p>
<b> Reject Section 121's extension of COBRA.</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Section 121 of S. 1028 changes COBRA (P.L. 99-272) by allowing individuals who have disabled family members, or who become disabled at any time during their coverage under an initial COBRA extension period, to extend their coverage for the additional 11 months. Currently, this extension is available only to workers who are disabled at the time they lose their coverage.<sup>24</sup>  Today, coverage under COBRA may last from 18 to 36 months, depending on the circumstances of the event leading to loss of health insurance. Under current law, covered employees and dependents are required to pay up to 102 percent of the total premium during the 18-month period. Disabled employees and dependents are eligible for 29 months of continued coverage but then must pay up to 150 percent of the total premium during the additional 11 months.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While the extension of COBRA sounds appealing to Members of Congress and the public, the reality is that employers, and ultimately workers, are required to pay the actual claims costs incurred by employees opting for coverage under COBRA. In short, such a change is another employer mandate. This extra expense has been particularly burdensome on employers already struggling to give health benefits to their current employees. According to the Employee Benefit Research Institute, a nonpartisan public policy research organization specializing in employee benefits, "many employers consider COBRA to be a costly mandate. Any expansion of COBRA would almost certainly increase employer cost for health insurance."<sup>25</sup>  And according to the Blue Cross/Blue Shield Association, "Claims costs for COBRA subscribers, on average, are typically 40 percent to 60 percent higher than the costs of active employees. Those people who seek COBRA coverage are people who need, but cannot obtain, affordable coverage as individuals, and their high use of medical services is directly reflected in the unusually high COBRA claims costs."<sup>26</sup>  These higher than average costs, which must be borne by employers, will lead inevitably to a reduction in employee benefits and compensation, or to withdrawal from the market.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Suggestions have been made that S. 1028's COBRA provision be extended to all companies. Placing additional mandates on small employers (less than 20 employees) could jeopardize protections for beneficiaries of self-funded ERISA health plans. For example, small employers who insure their employees under federal ERISA requirements have been able to avoid costly state-mandated benefits and taxes on their health plans. It would be ironic for Members of Congress to impose a new layer of federal mandates on a class of employers who have sought protection and relief from state mandates. Furthermore, such an unprecedented reach of federal regulatory power would preempt many of the innovative and effective health reform measures that states have developed and implemented themselves. Finally, the costs associated with such an extension would be too large for small businesses operating on a slim profit margin to bear.<sup>27</sup>
<p>
<b> Replace the Senate HPPCs with House provisions encouraging multiple employer health plans.</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The HPPCs in the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill as drafted are vague and will generate intrusive and burdensome federal regulations. Congress should strike this newly created infrastructure and replace it with provisions that would encourage the use of multiple employer health plans, voluntary health insurance associations, and other fully insured arrangements. Legislation to accomplish this (HR. 995) has been proposed by Representative Harris Fawell (R-IL).<sup>28</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The goal of giving small businesses and individuals increased purchasing power in the health insurance market is shared by a vast majority of Members of Congress. Unfortunately, S. 1028 creates an additional federal regulatory framework in setting up its HPPCs while simultaneously placing them at a competitive advantage over non-HPPC plans in the health insurance market. Lawmakers should be cautious in supporting legislation which, in its present form, easily could turn the health insurance market into a government-run entity at either the state or federal levels, reproducing something that looks and works like President Clinton's Health Security Act.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In stark contrast, Title III of the Fawell bill would allow smaller businesses to join together under the auspices of ERISA to purchase fully insured coverage or to cover their employees under self-insured multiple employer health plans (MEHPs).<sup>29</sup>  Since 85 percent of the uninsured population are in families headed by a worker,<sup>30</sup> it is significant that Title III of the Fawell proposal seeks to use ERISA to preempt state laws that prohibit two or more employers from obtaining fully insured health insurance coverage under any fully insured multiple employer arrangement.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In addition to providing smaller employers and individuals with increased purchasing power, the Fawell proposal eliminates the confusion surrounding the responsibilities of the states and the U.S. Department of Labor under ERISA. This confusion has led to a cottage industry of fly-by-night insurance swindlers who hide behind the ERISA preemption clause. Ironically, states that have enacted statutes regulating legitimate self-insured multiple employer plans often have hurt legitimate arrangements meeting the ERISA plan definitions and caused such arrangements to dissolve. These state actions have been arbitrary and do not follow any consistent pattern of reasoning, either within a state or among states. To remedy this situation, Title III of the Fawell proposal would give states a consistent guideline for the regulation of legitimate ERISA multiple employer plans wishing to continue their operations.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Title III also would give legitimate self-insured associations (including but not limited to church plans, franchise networks, associations, certain large employers, and collectively bargained plans) two clear and distinct regulatory options. First, legitimate associations could maintain or establish multiple employer health plans by seeking licensure in the states permitting such practices. Alternatively, these plans could seek federal certification pursuant to the "exemption" provision in current ERISA law. Under Title III of the Fawell proposal, entities that are created for the express purpose of purchasing health insurance would automatically be subject to the laws of the state in which they seek to do business. In turn, the states could make these groups meet any state-defined insurance or multiple employer plan licensing requirements state.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While smaller employers and individuals are at a disadvantage as they attempt to negotiate premium rates with insurance carriers, this does not necessitate the creation of new entities and additional federal regulations as prescribed in the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill. Accordingly, the Fawell proposal gives smaller employers and the self-employed the right to take advantage of the "[e]conomies of scale that large employers and multi-union employer plans have had for years under ERISA [to gain] access to affordable insurance."<sup>31</sup>  Unlike the uneven playing field created in S. 1028, the Fawell proposal would help ensure the ability of traditional insurance carriers to compete with self-insured plans for the small employer, self-employed, and individual market.

<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
S. 1028 enjoys broad bipartisan support in the Senate. In Congress, there is a strong desire to reform the broken health insurance market. S. 1028 is a well-intentioned effort to address the portability problem that confronts millions of workers and their families. While the creation of group-to-individual conversion is a positive step toward making health insurance more portable, its impact is diminished by the creation of additional regulatory distortions in the health insurance market. It is unfortunate that S. 1028 fails to address the tax system that currently impedes the ability of the market to function, and that it opens up the dangers of new distortions and sources of instability.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Over 80 percent of Americans under age 65 are covered by health insurance. While they generally are satisfied with their coverage, a genuine fear exists that this security could be lost. Reform of the health insurance market should address the source of this fear -- the fact that health insurance is predominantly employment-based and that federal tax policy exclusively favors this type of arrangement. This Senate bill does not address the key problems confronting the millions of Americans seeking to gain access to the health insurance market. The sponsors of S. 1028 attempt, instead, to create a transitional phase from group (employer-based) to individual coverage through federal regulation. Despite its drawbacks, however, S. 1028 could be the vehicle for significant health insurance reform, including the individual ownership of health insurance plans. By incorporating the improvements offered in the House proposal, S. 1028 could advance the security of health insurance for millions of working families. Instead of distorting the health insurance market with unnecessary and detrimental regulations, Members of Congress should promote a free-market policy by creating a health insurance system that is driven by consumer choice and genuine competition.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The health insurance market is one that traditionally has been regulated at the state level. Any congressional reform should not hamper the successes and innovations produced by state initiatives. To its sponsors' credit, S. 1028 challenges the false presumption that health insurance should be exclusively employment-based, and even more important, highlights the problems of portability and affordability that are inherent consequences of such a restrictive system. Members of Congress should build on the positive features of S. 1028 while making improvements that will give working Americans what they want from health insurance reform:  true portability and individual policies that give them long-term health insurance protection against the financial devastation of catastrophic illness.

<title>PRO-FAMILY TAX RELIEF</title>

<body>

<center>

<img src="/townhall/FRC/fampol/fampolgn.gif">

<h1>Pro-Family Tax Relief</h1>
<h2><i>A Look at Per-Child Credits ... and the Flat Tax</i></h2>

</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>N</font>ine years ago, President Reagan's White House 
Working Group on the Family issued a report entitled, <I>The Family: 
Preserving America's Future</I>, which had as its central recommendation
a dramatic expansion in per-child tax benefits.[1] Five years later,
the bipartisan National Commission on Children (on which then-Governor
Bill Clinton served) issued a report entitled <I>Beyond Rhetoric:
A New American Agenda for Children and Families</I>, which also
had as its central recommendation a dramatic increase in per-child
tax benefits.[2]

<p>

Given that leading officials from both parties have been talking
about pro-family tax relief for nearly a decade, the current debate
over per-child tax benefits should center around this question:
does the House GOP's proposed $500 children's tax credit offer
adequate relief to America's families or should Congress instead
move in the direction of the National Commission on Children's
call for a $1,000 per-child tax credit.

<p>

Sadly, that is not the debate taking place in Washington today.
In recent months, a noisy chorus of critics and naysayers have
been raising all sorts of objections to pro-family tax relief.
Their criticisms - which are at times contradictory - advance
a number of myths.

<p>

<center><h3>The Pander Bear Myth</h3></center>

<p>

Some argue that pro-family tax relief is an extravagant political
giveaway at odds with the larger public interest.  This idea is
advanced frequently by members of the media, who realize just
how popular pro-family tax relief is.  Rather than thoughtfully
considering the merits of various tax-cutting proposals, these
reporters and pundits smugly sneer at public officials, accusing
them of &quot;pandering&quot; to middle Americans.

<p>

One does not often find himself in the position of defending
politicians, but this sort of activity must be recognized for
what it is -- an attempt by members of the liberal media elite
to make Members of Congress feel guilty about doing what the people
elected them to do.  It is the flipside to the liberal media's
reaction to politicians who advance unpopular tax increases, who
are routinely hailed as &quot;profiles in courage.&quot;

<p>

Voters see nothing courageous about broken campaign promises.
Indeed, few things have contributed more to voter cynicism than
President Bush's failure to keep his &quot;no new taxes&quot;
pledge and President Clinton's decision to abandon his promised
&quot;middle-income tax cut&quot; soon after the 1992 election.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
It is important that policy-makers<br>
view this as a debate over 'pro-family<br>
tax cuts,' not simply 'middle-income<br>
tax relief.'
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The American people strongly support pro-family tax relief.
They want to keep more of the money they earn.  They sense that
the well-being of their families -- and the well-being of the nation
-- would improve if they had greater control over their lives.

<p>

On this point, they are right. To acknowledge as much is not
pandering.

<p>

<center><h3>The Bigger Deficit Myth</h3></center>

<p>

Some say pro-family tax relief will increase the deficit and
cause interest rates to rise.  It is quite true that the deficit
would rise if a pro-family tax cut were adopted <I>by itself</I>.
It is also quite true that an increase in government borrowing
would contract the supply of funds available for private lending,
thereby putting upward pressure on interest rates.

<p>

But it is important to point out that no one is talking about
adopting a pro-family tax cut <I>by itself</I>.  All of the sponsors
of major legislation have pledged to offset pro-family tax cuts
with dollar-for-dollar reductions in government spending.

<p>

Pro-family tax cuts &quot;paid for&quot;  by spending cuts cancel
each other out on the balance sheet.  They should have no effect
on the deficit or on interest rates.

<p>

<center><h3>The No-Growth Myth</h3></center>

<p>

Another argument often raised is that pro-family tax relief won't
spur economic growth.  This concern comes from those who believe
that tax policy should serve only economic ends, that it should
steer clear of social considerations and focus exclusively on
promoting economic growth.

<p>

There are two problems with this viewpoint.  First, much of what
is called  &quot;economic growth&quot; isn't growth at all.[3]
It is a movement of economic activity from the non-market home
economy to the quantifiable market economy.  For example, when
a family that once cared for its own child enrolls the child in
a paid day care program, there is no increase in the amount of
economic activity.  There is simply a shift from the non-market
economy to the market economy.  Yet this shift is counted as 
&quot;positive&quot; economic growth even though it often has a 
&quot;negative&quot; effect on the child's well-being.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
True economic growth involves an<br>
increase in productivity, not simply<br>
in market activity. Until our nation's<br>
economic debate is built around this<br>
fact, much of what is advanced in the<br>
name of 'growth' ought not to be adopted.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

True economic growth involves an increase in <I>productivity</I>,
not simply in market activity.  Until our nation's economic debate
is built around this fact, much of what is advanced in the name
of &quot;growth&quot; ought not to be adopted.

<p>

The second problem with the &quot;pro-family tax cuts don't spur
growth&quot; myth is that it pretends that economic policy can
be separated from social policy, that the size of a family's tax
burden simply affects its economic well-being and decision-making.
The truth, of course, is that tax policy not only affects people's
economic decision-making (about working, saving, spending, investing,
etc.) but also their &quot;non-economic&quot; decision-making
(about marrying, childbearing, childrearing, etc.).

<p>

While it is true that economic policy should strive to exert
as little influence as possible over &quot;non-economic&quot;
decisions (so that, for example, people who otherwise would not
marry won't get married just for the tax breaks), it is also true
that our nation's current economic policies exert considerable
influence over &quot;non-economic&quot; decision-making and that
this influence is almost always in an <I>anti-family</I> direction.

<p>

For example, Allan Carlson of the Rockford Institute has shown
that the Social Security system has a pernicious anti-child bias
because it robs parents of the social insurance value of their
children, thereby creating a disincentive for young couples to
invest in childrearing.[4] Indeed, if Congress were to seek to
offset this bias via the tax code (which is the only apparent
option given Social Security's sacrosanct status), it would have
to raise actual per-child savings to roughly $2,100 per child.[5]
When one considers that the net value of the current child tax
exemption is less than $400 per child (for the average family)
and that the high-water mark in the current debate is an additional
$500 per-child tax credit, it is easy to see why many people are
disappointed that the proposals currently being considered aren't
even bolder -- or to use the media's phrase, more courageous.

<p>

Of course, some are reluctant to adopt even a $500 credit because
they are intimidated by the economic &quot;cost&quot; in lost
revenue to the government.  While anti-family policies that took
more than 50 years to develop cannot be wiped out in 50 (or even
100) days, it is important to recognize that there is a social
&quot;cost&quot; to inaction or compromise.  The social &quot;cost&quot;
of weak families is measured in things like divorce rates and
crime statistics.  And these social problems impose enormous economic
costs on our society and our government.  Indeed, the best way
to reduce the demand for government services is to free families
to care for themselves.  Conversely, the best way to hinder the
dismantling of the welfare state is to leave the tax burden on
families with children at or near their current levels so that
families have a difficult time taking back responsibilities from
the state.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center><h3>The Middle-Class Only Myth</h3></center>

<p>

Should pro-family tax relief go only to middle-class taxpayers?
Some say so.

<p>

This concern makes the mistake of viewing tax issues through
the prism of class rather than through the prism of family.  It
is true that middle-class Americans often get short shrift in
current tax policy.  (For example, when combined employer-employee
payroll taxes are added to income taxes, some lower-middle-income
couples actually have a marginal tax rate comparable to 
upper-middle-income individuals in the 28 percent bracket.)

<p>

But it is even more true that families with children are shortchanged
in current tax policy.  For example, during the first four decades
after the end of WWII, the income tax burden on singles and childless
couples increased only slightly, while it increased more than
200 percent for families with two children.[6] Reagan-era reforms
helped to reverse this trend moderately, but the dramatic shift
in tax burden from non-parents to parents still dwarfs any shift
in tax burden along income lines.

<p>

Thus, it is important that policymakers view this as a debate
over &quot;pro-family tax cuts,&quot; not simply &quot;middle-income
tax relief.&quot;  This is the way both the 1986 Working Group
and the 1991 National Commission on Children saw the issue.  Indeed,
neither of these reports advocated any type of means-testing on
per-child benefits.  Both recognized that the principle being
advanced was tax relief for families of all incomes to use in
raising children, not tax relief to people who happen to fall
into an income category that everyone considers middle-class (a
category that invariably shrinks as public debate progresses).

<p>

The fact that tax relief should be first and foremost pro-family
does not mean that policymakers should be unconcerned about the
distributional impact of these cuts.  To its credit, the House
GOP plan extends relief in the form of a per-child credit rather
than an increased per-child exemption.  In actual dollar terms,
a credit provides equal relief to all taxpayers; but in 
percentage-of-tax-burden terms, it offers greater relief to working-class 
and middle-income taxpayers than to wealthier taxpayers. (Tax exemptions, 
conversely, skew savings up the income scale, offering greater per-child 
savings to those in higher brackets.)

<p>

This is not to say that tax exemptions are always inferior to
tax credits; for example, one of the virtues of the current exemption
is that its value rises if tax rates rise, thereby guaranteeing
continued horizontal tax equity between parents and non-parents
at any income level.

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Still, given the tax code's current problems, a non-means-tested
tax credit is the best mechanism for helping families with children.
Indeed, if Congress wanted to maximize its distributional bang
for buck, it might want to consider a non-refundable version of
the 1991 National Commission on Children's $1,000 credit (which
replaced the existing exemption, thereby offering $600+ in net
per-child relief to those in the 15 percent tax bracket, but less
than $300 in net per-child tax relief to those in higher tax brackets).
Moving in this direction would make it easier for Congress to
lift the existing (and newly-proposed) income caps on per-child
benefits -- a problem that definitely needs addressing since income
caps at any level produce marriage penalties.

<p>

Speaking of marriage penalties, the income caps on the Earned
Income Tax Credit have created such a serious anti-marriage effect
that Congress should use all of the monies set aside in the marriage
penalty section of the American Dream Restoration Act to address
the marriage bias facing families earning below the median income.
The Talent-Faircloth welfare reform initiative from 1994 called
for a $1,000 pro-marriage tax credit.  This would be a constructive,
problem-solving first step.  It ought to be adopted.

<p>

<center><h3>The Can't Trust Parents Myth</h3></center>

<p>

Some believe pro-family tax relief should tie benefits to family
expenses (like education) that the government should promote.
This concern springs from the notion that the government knows
more about what families should spend their money for than parents
do.

<p>

Not only is this a false premise, but it leads to all sorts of
unproductive economic distortions.  Indeed, one of the chief reasons
college tuition costs have been rising at a pace exceeding the
general inflation rate is that many students have been given grants
and loans that could be used only for educational purposes.  Knowing
this to be the case, college administrators have raised the cost
of higher education beyond what it would be if students' economic
resources were completely fungible and available for multiple
uses.

<p>

While no one wants to discourage bright young people from pursuing
a higher education, the sad truth is that tax cuts earmarked for
this or any other family expense will have the effect of increasing
the cost of that good or service, thereby exacerbating current
problems and putting a college education out of the reach of some
interested students.  In addition, tax deductions keyed to college
tuition expenses benefit students attending higher-priced schools
more than other students.

<p>

While it would be counter-productive for Congress to provide
tax cuts for specific expenses, it would be helpful for Congress
to modify existing Individual Retirement Account (IRA) rules to
permit taxpayers to enjoy tax-favored savings for a wider variety
of purposes (college tuition, first-time home-buying, etc.). 
In the first case, Congress would be limiting families' economic
freedom, in the second, it would be expanding it.

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

This is not to say, however, that the Super IRA included in the
House GOP Contract should be adopted in its current form.  The
&quot;back-loaded&quot; nature of its design obligates future
generations to an economic promise made today.  Given the size
of the federal debt, and the pernicious anti-family influence
of intergenerational entitlement programs, Congress should steer
clear of repeating past mistakes.  If tax-favored savings are
to be expanded, they should be expanded within the context of
a &quot;front-loaded&quot; savings mechanism.

<p>

<center><h3>Armey's Flat Tax Appeal</h3></center>

<p>

While the proposed increase in per-child tax benefits is commanding
center stage in the current debate, there is growing interest
in a flat tax proposal sponsored by House GOP Minority Leader
Dick Armey.  The Armey proposal, which some Republicans want to
make a central plank in the 1996 GOP campaign platform, would
reduce the federal income tax form to the size of a post card
by eliminating all existing deductions, exemptions, and credits.
Thus, after claiming &quot;personal allowances&quot; (which allow
taxpayers to adjust their tax liability for family size), all
taxpayers would pay income taxes at a 17 percent marginal rate.

<p>

As such, the Armey plan has a number of appealing features.
These include:

<ul><p>

<li><b><i>Simplicity</i></b>.  Despite periodic attempts to make
tax filing easier, America's tax code is
littered with so many cumbersome rules, regulations, and stipulations
that many ordinary taxpayers feel justifiably overwhelmed.  Eliminating
the tax code's complexity would reduce errors and encourage respect
for and compliance with the code.  It would also free people to
make more productive use of the time they now devote to income
tax compliance.  According to economist Walter Williams of George
Mason University, Americans spend more than six billion hours
each year on record keeping, tax planning, and tax return preparation.
If those same hours were spent producing useful things, Williams
says they would be equal to the combined output of our auto, truck,
and aircraft industries.[7]

<p>

<li><b><i>No Withholding</i></b>.  Rather than continuing the
current system of having employers
withhold income taxes from employees' wages, the Armey plan would
permit taxpayers to take home their entire gross earnings and
then make a monthly tax payment to the government (much as they
currently make a monthly mortgage payment to their lending company).
Eliminating wage withholding would free employers from burdensome
administrative paperwork -- and would help taxpayers see just how
large their tax bite is.  Nothing fosters high taxes more than
the fact that they are currently &quot;hidden&quot; from full
view by wage withholding.  Were all earnings to &quot;pass through&quot;
taxpayers' wallets, Americans would undoubtedly become more aware
of their current tax burden -- and of any changes to it in the
future.

<p>

<li><b><i>Reduced Marriage Penalty</i></b>.  The Armey plan eliminates
most existing marriage penalties in the current income tax code by 
offering marrieds a personal allowance twice that of singles and by 
eliminating all tax rate progressivity. (By retaining the &quot;head of 
household&quot; filing category for single parents, the marriage penalty 
is not eliminated altogether.)  Given the size of the current penalty
(particularly among the working poor) and the larger cultural
need to strengthen the institution of marriage, the Armey plan's
improved treatment of marriage compares well to current law.

<p>

<li><b><i>No Junk</i></b>.  While there is a case to be made for
tax simplification for simplification's
sake, the Armey plan's eradication of existing deductions and
credits has the added virtue of eliminating many ill-conceived
tax write-offs.  For example, the deductibility of state and local
taxes has the effect of redistributing income from people living
in low-tax areas to people living in high-tax states.  Similarly,
the dependant care tax credit has the effect of redistributing
income from families that care for their own children to families
that enroll their children in day care.  Eliminating such write-offs
would eliminate economic distortions and perverse social incentives.

<p>

<li><b><i>Generous Family Benefits</i></b>.  The Armey plan proposes
personal allowances of $13,100
for singles, $26,200 for marrieds, and $5,300 for each dependent
child.  As such, a typical family of four would not begin paying
income taxes until it has earned $36,800 in income.  Although
these family benefits are less generous than those which existed
in the late 1940s and early 1950s, they are considerably higher
than current thresholds (which shield a family of four's first
$16,150 from income taxation).

</ul><p>

<center><h3>Challenges for The Armey Approach</h3></center>

<p>

While the Armey plan has many appealing features, it also faces
a number of challenges -- challenges that will need to be addressed
before the Armey plan (or any variation of it) can be adopted.
These include:

<p><ul>

<li><b><i>Doesn't The Federal Government Already Have An Effective
Flat Tax?</i></b> Most &quot;flat
tax&quot; proponents think only in terms of leveling federal
income taxes.  But America's taxpayers not only pay federal income
taxes but also federal payroll taxes.  The combined employer-employee
share of payroll taxes is just over 15 percent for taxpayers earning
up to $60,600.  This means that most working-class and middle-income
families have a combined marginal tax rate of roughly 30 percent
(divided almost equally between payroll and income taxes).  This
amount is comparable to the marginal tax rate of upper-middle-income
taxpayers in the 28 and 31 percent income tax brackets.

<p>

If Congress were to adopt the Armey plan, and to leave in place
the existing payroll tax, taxpayers in the current 15 percent
income tax bracket would see their combined marginal tax rate
rise to over 32 percent (because Armey replaces the 15 percent
rate with a 17 percent rate).  Meanwhile, upper-middle-income
taxpayers (whose incomes exceed the current cap on payroll taxes)
would experience a dramatic reduction in marginal tax rates from
28 and 31 percent to 17 percent.

</ul>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
Nothing fosters high taxes more<br>
than the fact that they are<br>
currently hidden from full<br>
view by wage witholding.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<ul>

Armey proponents choose not to address the payroll tax question,
arguing that social security &quot;contributions&quot; should
be viewed as mandatory payments to a pension plan rather than
taxes to support a cash transfer program.  Given that taxpayers
have no control of these &quot;mandatory payments,&quot; Congress
should alter the construct of the Armey plan so that it takes
payroll taxes into consideration.  This would ensure that taxpayers
earning below $60,600 would not have higher marginal tax rates
than those making above $60,600.

<p>

<li><b><i>Doesn't Rate Progressivity Offset The Anti-Family Aspects
Of The Social Security System?</i></b> Allan Carlson of the Rockford 
Institute argues that &quot;the effect of a flat income tax rate at levels
above 10 percent is to weaken the family as an economic unit.&quot;[8]
Carlson believes a progressive income tax is preferable because
rate progressivity encourages non-market home production over
market production.  Given that the long-term health of our society
(and, for that matter, the long-term health of our economy) would
be threatened by the shift of certain responsibilities from families
and volunteer associations to the market economy, Carlson believes
taxwriters should attempt to make the tax code more progressive
rather than less.  (He would take the revenues generated by greater
progressivity and devote them to a $1,500 per-child credit and
a revival of income-splitting to solve the marriage penalty problem.)

<p>

While Carlson's call for greater progressivity is unlikely to
find an audience with most GOP policymakers, it is important to
point out that the case for a flat tax is seriously weakened by
the social security system's anti-child bias.  If there were no
social security system, parents would have a natural economic
incentive to invest in childrearing because their economic security
in old age would be directly linked to their children's future
productivity.  In other words, in a world without social security,
the workaholic who neglects his childrearing responsibilities
puts himself at risk in old age because his children may turn
out to be dolts or sloths incapable of offering him support if
needed.

</ul>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<ul>

In a world with social security, however, the workaholic who
neglects his childrearing responsibilities puts himself at no
such risk.  If his kids turn out to be unproductive, he does not
suffer -- so long as there are plenty of well-reared children from
other families capable of keeping the system afloat.

<p>

Thankfully, economic incentives are not the only factors -- or
even the primary factors -- influencing parental investments in
children.  Moral imperatives still carry much sway.

<p>

But lest anyone think economic factors are irrelevant, consider
how often one hears talk today from families that say they &quot;can't
afford another child&quot; or &quot;can't afford to have one parent
stay home with young children because they have to have two paychecks.&quot;

<p>

In the abstract, one can easily make a case that an ideal economic
system would have neither a progressive income tax nor an old-age
social insurance scheme.

<p>

Given that no modification in social security is being proposed,
proponents of the Armey flat tax must explain how they would propose
to counteract policy-based incentives for parents to neglect their
non-market childrearing duties.

<p>

<li><b><i>How Does Eliminating Charitable Contributions Square
With A Larger Social Vision That Wants To Replace Government Welfare 
With Private Charity?</i></b> 
To their credit, most proponents of the Armey flat tax are also
advocates of limited government who would like to see the welfare
state dismantled and replaced by private charity.  While this
philosophy does not obligate one to support the continuation
of tax write-offs for charitable contributions, it may be asking
too much to expect the American people simultaneously to support
an elimination of charitable tax deductions and a dismantling
of government welfare programs.  Given the serious social problems
associated with government welfare programs, Congress should do
nothing that might have the effect of undermining public support
for dismantling the welfare state.  Not only does this argue for
the retention of charitable contributions, it actually argues
for an expansion of them.

<p>

Here again, the question is not necessarily one of what is best
in the abstract.  The question, instead, is whether the goal of
a deduction-free tax code should supersede all other goals -- including
the goal of shifting welfare responsibilities from the state to
the charitable sector.

<p>

<li><b><i>How Will Eliminating The Deductibility Of Mortgage Interest
Affect Property Values And The Real Net Worth Of Families?</i></b> Just 
as charitable contributions present a dilemma to Armey flat tax 
proponents, so too do home mortgage interest payments.

<p>

While the intellectual case for mortgage interest deductions
is far weaker than for charitable contributions -- in fact, Carlson
argues that mortgage interest deductions have had an anti-family
effect by encouraging smaller households and spurring artificial
growth in housing prices[9] -- the problem is that eliminating the
mortgage interest deduction that is now in place could have an
even more serious anti-family effect.  Many families have a considerable
share of their entire net worth tied up in their homes.  If a
proposal eliminating the mortgage interest deduction were to pass,
and thereby to pull the rug out from under property owners, the
social and economic effects could be quite serious.  Indeed, the
recession that occurred during the Bush Administration was caused
in part by a decline in home values.  As families saw their net
worth falling, they understandably felt less freedom to make new
purchases.

<p>

It is possible, as Armey proponents maintain, that the negative
effect on property values of eliminating home mortgage deductibility
will be offset by the positive effect of greater economic growth
in other parts of the economy.  But it is also quite possible
that consumers will respond to the elimination of home mortgage
deductibility in the same manner they responded to the housing
recession of the late 1980s.

<p>

Given that those who have the most to lose from instability in
the housing market are young families who have recently purchased
first homes, Congress must proceed very cautiously in this area.

<p>

<li><b><i>Won't The Value Of Pro-Family Benefits Decline As The
Legislative Process Unfolds?</i></b> As noted earlier, the Armey tax 
plan includes
adjustments for family size that exceed current law.  While this
is one of the plan's most laudable features, there is reason to
believe that the benefit levels leaving the starting gate of the
legislative process would never survive the marathon to the finish
line.  The reason is simple:  if any change is made in the Armey
plan that would have the effect of reducing revenues (such as
reinserting certain tax write-offs) the only options Armey would
have would be:

<p><ul>

(1)  to increase the deficit;<br>
(2)  to raise the tax rate above 17 percent; or<br>
(3)  to reduce family benefits.

</ul><p>

The first option would be unlikely in any scenario, but is especially
so given that Armey's proposal, by his own estimates, would raise
$40 billion less than current law (and some claim the shortfall
would be as much as four times this amount).  Indeed, given the
level of concern that has already arisen about revenue shortfalls,
it is quite possible that family tax benefits could be raided
even if no other changes were made to the Armey plan.

<p>

The second option -- raising the tax rate above 17 percent -- is
also unlikely because the political support for the flat tax largely
hangs or falls on the size of this number.  Tax policy is mysterious
to most Americans.  Average citizens are far more likely to follow
fluctuations in the flat rate structure than fluctuations in the
family benefits -- especially since the premise of the debate is
that we need a flat <I>rate</I>.

</ul>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<font size=+1><b><i>
Those who believe the most serious<br>

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<ul>

Thus, those who believe the most serious problem in the current
tax code is the absence of significant pro-family benefits are
poorly served by a debate that emphasizes rates rather than the
size of pro-family benefits.

<p>

Indeed, one of the virtues of the existing debate surrounding
the House GOP's Contract proposal is that it has centered around
the $500 per-child figure.  While this amount should be higher,
it will be difficult for Members of Congress to pass something
less than this amount without having to do an awful lot of explaining
to their constituents. Hopefully, Armey proponents can find
a way to offer this level of protection to pro-family benefits
during the legislative process.

</ul><p>

<center><h3>Family First</h3></center>

<p>

After years of talk but no action on the pro-family tax front,
Congress appears poised to finally adopt some significant per-child
relief.  This is long overdue.  In 1948, a median income family
of four sent two percent of its annual income to the federal government
in federal income and payroll taxes.  Today, that same family
sends 24.5 percent of its income to the Federal Treasury.[10] The
erosion in the value of per-child benefits is the primary reason
for this dramatic increase in the income tax burden of America's
families.  According to Eugene Steuerle of the Urban Institute,
the current child exemption would need to be quadrupled in size
in order to offset the same percentage of income that the exemption
shielded from taxation in 1948.[11]

<p>

Given the magnitude of this historic shift, nothing -- including
the possibility of making even more dramatic tax changes in the
near future -- should deter Congress from adopting at least $500
in per-child tax savings.

<h2>A CLOSER LOOK</h2>

<p><hr width=60% noshade><p>

<h2>The Limits of Tax Relief</h2>

</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>W</font>hile it is important for Members of Congress to 
recognize the virtues of pro-family tax relief, it is also important 
for them to recognize the limitations of pro-family relief.

<p>

Pro-family tax relief will not make husbands love their wives
or children respect their parents.  It will not clear up filthy
TV or remove child predators from our streets.  In short, pro-family
tax relief, by itself, will not magically solve the myriad social
problems facing America's families, neighborhoods, and communities.

<p>

But pro-family tax relief will make it easier for families to
thrive by reducing economic stress.  It will make it easier for
parent
them from other harms by freeing them to spend more of their time
with their children and less of their time frantically chasing
the almighty, overtaxed dollar.

<p>

In short, pro-family tax relief will empower parents to address
many family needs that only they can meet.

<p>

America needs parents who want to raise their children well.
But we also need policies that empower them to act upon these
sentiments.

<p>

The 104th Congress should adopt nothing less than $500 in per-child
tax relief for all taxpaying families.

<title>FREEING AMERICA'S SCHOOLS</title>

<body>

<center>

<img src="/townhall/FRC/fampol/fampolbl.gif">

<h1>Freeing America's Schools</h1>
<h2><i>The Case Against the U.S. Education Department</i></h2>

</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>A</font> century and a half ago, Alexis de 
Tocqueville recognized that increased centralization and 
bureaucratization saps civic and individual responsibility. 
"[A] centralized administration is fit only to enervate the 
nations in which it exists, by incessantly diminishing their 
local spirit",[1] wrote Tocqueville.

<p>

Cathy Duffy, in a new book titled <i>Government Nannies</i>, 
echoes Tocqueville's observation: "History and common sense 
tell us that people are more likely to assume responsibility 
when they know that no one else will.  If I knew that no one 
else was going to watch my car's gas gauge and remind me to 
fill the tank before it hits empty, I would do it myself.  
But my husband watches it closely and puts gas in the car for 
me.  As a result of his kindness, I rarely look at the gas gauge."[2]

<p>

Unfortunately, many Americans seem to have forgotten this principle 
and have yielded responsibility for certain domestic functions to 
central planners working in the federal government.  Nowhere is 
this more apparent than in the area of education, where increased 
bureaucratic control has bred local apathy which, in turn, has bred 
greater bureaucratic control.  Indeed, many contemporary Americans 
resemble the 19th century European described by Tocqueville:

<p>

<blockquote><i>

The condition of his village, the police of his street, the 
repairs of the church or the parsonage, do not concern him; 
for he looks upon all these things as unconnected with himself 
and as the property of a powerful stranger whom he calls the 
government....  This want of interest in his own affairs goes 
so far that if his own safety or that of his children is at last 
endangered, instead of trying to avert the peril, he will fold 
his arms and wait till the whole nation comes to his aid....</i>[3]

</blockquote>

apathy which, in turn, has bred<br>
greater bureaucratic control.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Tocqueville warns that, when a nation reaches this point, 
"it must either change its customs and its laws, or perish; 
for the source of public virtues is dried up; and though it 
may contain subjects, it has no citizens."[4]

<p>

<center><h3>Ending the Federal Role in Education</h3></center>

<p>

The United States Constitution is a document of enumerated powers. 
That is, the Federal government is permitted to do only what the 
Constitution specifically lists.  This is expressed clearly and 
succinctly in the 10th amendment:   "The powers not delegated to 
the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved 
to the States respectively, or to the people."

<p>

Since education is not listed as a Federal responsibility, it was 
exclusively under the jurisdiction of states and localities through 
most of our history.  Things began to change in the 1930s when the 
New Deal brought increasing Federal involvement.  Later, under 
Eisenhower, a cabinet-level department was created:  Health, 
Education and Welfare.  And under the Johnson Administration, 
passage of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act expanded 
federal involvement further.

<p>

Then, in 1976, Democratic presidential nominee Jimmy Carter 
promised the creation of a separate education department if 
elected and received the backing of the National Education 
Association (NEA) as a result.  In 1979, President Carter set 
about to make good on his promise.  But there was strong opposition 
from the American Federation of Teachers (the second-largest teacher 
union), from much of higher education, and from the general public. 
The AFL-CIO attacked the idea[5] and even the liberal <i>Washington 
Post</i> argued that "shifting federal education programs to a 
separate department increases bureaucratic costs."[6]

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Many Americans feared that a cabinet-level department would 
lead to an expanded federal role in education.  Marvin Stone, 
in an editorial in <i>U.S. News & World Report</i>, put it 
this way:   Would the Education Department have the power to 
tamper with America's traditional local control of education? 
Of course it would.  Where there is money to be given, there 
is the implicit responsibility to make sure that it is spent 
according to the purposes of the donors  -- or else.[7]

<p>

While the bill establishing the department stated emphatically 
that the Department would not undermine state and local control, 
Stone noted:

<p>

<blockquote><i>

...a subtle schizophrenia, meandering through the legislation and 
the committee appraisal, suggests that the authors' inward dream 
for the department runs at odds with the stated restrictions. One 
keeps encountering such phrases as  "implement...at the local level" 
...  "assesses the achievement of federal objectives" ... and 
"monitoring parental and public participation."</i>[8]

</blockquote>

<p>

Today, Stone's essay seems prophetic.  The <i>Guide to U.S. 
Department of Education Programs</i> lists 241 separate programs, 
many of which have usurped the prerogatives of the states.  For 
example, the index identifies six programs exclusively for Native 
Hawaiians.  It is instructive to imagine tax monies garnered in 
Oahu, transferred to a federal bureaucracy 6,000 miles away, 
filtered expensively through Washington's education blob, and the 
remainder returned to the island state for Native Hawaiian 
education.  It is not difficult to believe that Hawaiians could 
manage these programs more efficiently and less expensively than 
the federal government.  And if Hawaiians, then why not Carolinians, 
Vermonters, and Texans as well?

<p>

The U.S. Education Department, then, is an entity with a dubious 
past.  Its conception was of doubtful legitimacy, given the 
strictures of Constitution and tradition.  The circumstances 
of its birth were suspect -- more or less a political payoff 
to the NEA.  Furthermore, the U.S. Education Department has 
not improved American education.

<p>

Before its creation, President Carter could point to  "[o]ur 
Nation's pluralistic education system" as "the most competent 
and open in the world...."[9] No longer so.  According to 
former Secretary of Education William Bennett, more than 90 
percent of the students entering U.S. colleges would not be 
admitted to post-secondary education anywhere else in the world.[10] 
The 1990 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) declared 
that as many as half of elementary and secondary students do not 
demonstrate  "competency in challenging subject matter in English, 
mathematics, science, history, and geography.  Further, even fewer 
are able to use their minds well."[11]

Meanwhile, the U.S. Education Department has grown into a huge 
bureaucratic blob.  It has elbowed its way into places it does 
not belong, not the least of which are local schools and family 
life.

<p>

<center><h3>Goals 2000</h3></center>

<p>

On March 31, 1994, federal intrusiveness reached a new height with 
passage of Goals 2000.  Groundwork for the program was being laid 
as early as 1987 when Richard Riley and Hillary Rodham Clinton 
served on the Southern Regional Education Board's (SREB) Commission 
on Educational Quality.  Bill Clinton also participated in SREB 
meetings.  The commission developed a set of goals and published 
<i>Goals for Education:  Challenge 2000</i> in 1988.[12] In 1989, 
President Bush summoned the nation's governors to an educational 
summit meeting in Charlottesville, Virginia.  At this gathering, 
then-Governor Clinton played a major role in leading the governors 
to adopt six ambitious national goals for education.  These goals 
formed the basis of America 2000, President Bush's plan for 
education reform.

<p>

The America 2000 plan represented a dramatic departure from 
the American political tradition in education, as explained 
by John F. Jennings, director of the Center on National 
Education Policy:

<p>

<blockquote><i>

Democratic Presidents Kennedy and Johnson had proposed a major 
expansion of federal aid to education in the 1960s and had 
achieved the enactment of historic legislation that created 
the current array of federal programs.  But they were dogged 
along the way by criticism from conservatives who asserted that 
the liberals were really trying to nationalize education.  Now, 
25 years later, it was a self-proclaimed conservative Republican, 
not a liberal Democrat, who was advocating <b>a monumental 
movement away from local control of education</b>.</i>[13] 
<i>(emphasis added)

</i></blockquote>

<p>

While Bush failed to get both Houses of Congress to adopt his 
plan, President Clinton was quick to seize the initiative on 
this issue soon after his election in 1992.  Clinton expanded 
Bush's plan, renamed it Goals 2000, and made it the cornerstone 
of his Education Department's agenda.

<p>

The reach of Goals 2000 as educational innovation can hardly be 
overstated.  Albert Shanker of the American Federation of 
Teachers called it  "the most important piece of education 
legislation we've ever had."[14] And Secretary of Education 
Richard Riley wrote,  "For the first time in the nation's 
history, a statutory framework defining an appropriate role 
for the federal government has been enacted."[15]

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
Goals 2000 includes national<br>
education goals and standards<br>
that override local priorities<br>
and ignore the fact that many<br>

standards for student learning.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Goals 2000 provides a framework for restructuring the American 
system of education, creating tighter and more definite links 
between the federal, state and local levels.  This makes it 
even easier for the Education Department to tamper with local 
schools than Marvin Stone once envisioned.

<p>

Indeed, Goals 2000 includes national education goals and standards 
that override local priorities and ignore the fact that many 
private entities have developed standards for student learning. 
E.D. Hirsch, for example, has written a series of books on cultural 
literacy, describing fundamentals of education at each grade level. 
The Family Research Council has published an outline of U.S. history 
entitled <i>Let Freedom Ring</i>. William Bennett's best-selling 
<i>Book of Virtues</i> is a wonderful source of America's literary 
heritage.  All of these examples meet the need for high academic 
standards.

<p>

What is revolutionary about Goals 2000 is the idea that the federal 
government should be involved in creating and certifying standards 
for education and in determining  "official knowledge."

<p>

The goals, themselves, are highly problematic.  First, they smack 
of Utopianism.  They illustrate the 
"with-a-stroke-of-this-pen-I-change-the-world" kind of thought that 
sometimes afflicts high-level bureaucrats and politicians. For 
example,[16] Goal Six says that every adult American will be 
literate.  Since some estimates put the number of adult illiterates 
at nearly four million and the number of functional illiterates at 
30 million, their re-education would require a national mobilization 
akin to fighting World War I.  And these are <b>adults</b> -- 
outside the scope of compulsory education.  Goals like this with 
a timetable like this (all problems solved in six years!) are so 
unrealistic as to undermine public confidence in the politicians 
and the educational establishment.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
'National standards' could<br>
actually work to 'dumb down'<br>
educational expectations<br>
rather than to raise them.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The goals also have coercive implications.  Goal One says "all 
children in America will start school ready to learn."  Assuming 
the statement is not mere rhetoric, how will the government meet 
this goal?  Or consider Goal Eight:   "Every school will promote 
partnerships that will increase parental involvement and 
participation in promoting the social, emotional, and academic 
growth of children."  Note the peremptory  "will": these 
"partnerships" are not optional.  They instruct school officials 
to direct parents rather than stating that parents are to be 
primarily responsible for their children's education. Moreover, 
Goals 2000 defines parental involvement in mostly peripheral 
terms: parent-teacher conferences, PTA meetings, etc.

<p>

Goal Three says that "American students will leave grade four, 
eight, and twelve having demonstrated competency in challenging 
subject matter...."  Who decides what  "challenging subject matter" 
is, and what is  "demonstrated competency" over it?  The Goals 2000 
law created a new federal agency, the National Educational Standards 
and Improvement Council (NESIC).  Under the law, states may draw up 
state educational standards or use the national standards that will 
also be made available.  All of this was declared, in the Goals 2000 
law itself, to be entirely voluntary.  Indeed, among its supporters, 
Goals 2000 is hardly mentioned without the assuring  "voluntary" 
prefix.  Calling it  "voluntary" is actually highly misleading, 
especially in light of other legislation.  As Secretary of Education 
Richard Riley said of the Goals 2000 law,  "We were determined that 
Goals 2000 become the prism through which amendments to every other 
program in elementary and secondary education would be considered."[17]

<p>

One such program is the Elementary and Secondary Education Act 
(ESEA), under which 90 percent of the schools in the nation 
receive funding.  Under <i>this</i> law states cannot receive federal 
funding for elementary and secondary education unless they follow 
an application process nearly identical to that contained in Goals 
2000.  In fact the ESEA declares that  "[i]f a State has State 
content standards or State student performance standards developed 
under title III of the Goals 2000:  Educate America Act and an 
aligned set of assessments...the State shall use such standards 
and assessments"[18] as its plan to be submitted for application 
purposes.

<p>

Some argue that Goals 2000 is voluntary because states are free to 
write standards of their own.  The catch is that even these state 
standards must be approved by the U.S. Department of Education in 
order for the state to receive Goals 2000 funds.  What kind of 
standards are the feds likely to approve?  Since there will be 
federal standards and curriculum for each discipline, no state 
will be left guessing.  And no one who understands human nature 
will be left guessing about what all the states' materials will 
tend to look like. "National standards" sounds challenging: 
they aren't. The U.S. Education Department, for example, recently 
sued Ohio for imposing an eighth grade reading requirement as a 
condition of high school graduation. The standard was too 
restrictive, too discriminatory. Thus, "national standards" 
could actually work to  "dumb down" educational expectations, 
rather than to raise them.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center><h3>Faulty Standards</h3></center>

<p>

Consider the U.S. history standards, written by the Center for 
History in the Schools at UCLA under a $2 million grant from the 
U.S. Education Department and the National Endowment for the 
Humanities.  They contain many historical facts and interesting 
teaching strategies.  But nothing could better demonstrate the 
dangers of a national curriculum.  The standards are replete 
with political correctness.  Paul Revere, Thomas Edison, J.P. 
Morgan, the Wright Brothers, Alexander Graham Bell, Robert E. 
Lee, and Albert Einstein are all omitted; yet, Madonna, Speckled 
Snake and The Simpsons are included.

<p>

The standards not only trivialize American history, but also 
present an exceedingly gloomy view of America.  Nobody wants 
a history written through rose-colored glasses --  but the 
standards go beyond an honest appraisal of national failures, 
replacing  "America: land of opportunity," with  "America: land 
of oppression."  As Albert Shanker pointed out, no other 
government has tried to teach its children to have negative 
feelings about their own country.[19]

<p>

Political correctness also colors many of the questions and 
assignments in the history standards.  For example, students 
are asked to  "explain how feminism was compelling in its 
analysis of women's problems and solutions offered."  To the 
ideologically charged individuals who wrote the standards, 
feminist ideology could only be  "compelling."  But for many 
Americans, this premise is highly debatable.  That there is 
such a disagreement should not be a problem.  Histories should 
acknowledge diversity of opinion, instead of pretending that all 
people hold the same views.  It is highly ironic that those whose 
very creed is  "diversity" should seek to ignore and marginalize 
opinion when it differs from their own.

<p>

Another weakness of the standards has been little noted in the 
national discussion:  they contain virtually no explanation of 
what communism is and what it did.  It is difficult to see how 
any student could make sense of the 20th century without 
understanding what Marx and Lenin taught and how Stalin acted 
on those teachings.  The Cold War for example -- nearly half a 
century of American history -- becomes inexplicable.  During this 
century, Soviet Communism was responsible for at least 60 million 
deaths.  Adding Communist China brings the toll to many millions 
more.  Without an understanding of this, the student could only 
consider the collision of democracy and Communism to be like some 
pointless dynastic or boundary-marker squabble of the distant past.

<p>

Indeed, the history standards implicitly subscribe to the doctrine 
of moral equivalence, describing the Cold War merely as "swordplay 
of the Soviet Union and the United States," and making no mention of 
Soviet invasions of Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Afghanistan.  They 
describe  "Soviet advances in space" and the <i>Challenger</i> 
disaster, while omitting any reference to John Glenn or the successful 
U.S. moon landing.  Columnist George Will says they show a "cranky 
anti-Americanism."[20]

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

How is it possible that a program like Goals 2000 -- quite inimical 
to American tradition -- has become the manual for running local 
schools?  Partly, as we have seen, through subterfuge: the 
insistent repetition that it is entirely voluntary.  Partly because 
the profound crisis of American education has convinced many that 
only an enormous federal initiative can cope with it.  But this 
conviction is based on the fallacy that the federal government has 
money of its own.  In reality, the only money the U.S. Education 
Department has is money that citizens once earned.  Think back to 
the example of the federal programs for Native Hawaiians.  They 
typify every federal education program:  the money localities give 
up to Washington is returned to them -- much diminished.  The 
total U.S. Education Department budget has reached a level of $30 
billion dollars.  What if this money were simply routed to the local 
schools instead of being routed through the federal bureaucracy? It 
tickles the imagination to think of the textbooks and desks and 
computers and art classes and chemistry labs and gymnasiums and 
field trips and new teachers that could be financed with the savings.

<p>

There would be another great advantage for localities if the 
federal government got out of the education business.  There 
is a misperception that Washington provides the lion's share 
of education funding in this nation.  In reality, federal 
spending accounts for only about 6.5 percent[21] of the funding 
that goes into local education. Yet, "Uncle Sam's leverage 
over U.S. education is greater than his six or seven percent of 
the school budget would indicate," notes Chester Finn, former 
assistant secretary of education under President Reagan.[22] 
Overbearing federal regulations hinder local school freedom. 
Getting the federal education bureaucracy out of our pockets 
and off our backs should liberate local leaders and infuse 
communities with a new sense of local spirit.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

President Carter, arguing in 1979 for the establishment of a U.S. 
Education Department, boasted: "Under the proposal I am submitting 
today, the Department of Education will include more than 150 programs 
and 16,200 employees.  With a budget of more than $13 billion, this 
Department will be larger than five other Departments including Energy, 
Commerce, Justice, Interior and State."[23] Such was the sentiment with 
which the U.S. Education Department was formed.  Few politicians would 
dare to highlight these facts today.  In its 15 years of existence the 
U.S. Education Department has added 100 programs, more than doubled its 
annual expenditures, and doubled its outlays as a percentage of total 
federal spending, from one percent to two percent.[24] In hindsight, 
it is clear that enlarging the federal role in education was a mistake. 
As early as 1981, policy analysts recognized that "the creation of this 
Department was a mistake, that its enactment is analogous to an inversion 
of the proverbial miller's tale, spinning something fine back into 
something coarse."[25] The federal government should no longer have a 
role in American education.

<p>

<center><h3>Common Objections</h3></center>

<p>

Some argue that the U.S. Education Department must be preserved 
because of four seemingly critical functions of the federal department: 
helping the disabled, protecting civil rights, providing college loans, 
and conducting national educational research.  But there is reason to 
believe that these functions can be handled by state and local 
governments and by private entities.  Indeed, one-size-fits-all 
administrative policies handed down by the federal government have 
often proved counter-productive.  Consider, for example, special 
education.

<p>

The federal government's spending on special education accounts for 
a very small percentage of the cost of educating each student with 
disabilities -- only eight percent.  Yet, its regulations define the 
special education policies which local schools must follow.

<p>

The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) began two 
decades ago with the purpose of providing all children with handicaps 
a "free and appropriate public education."  After many reauthorizations 
and amendments, the federal special education requirements are now 
numerous, detailed and cumbersome.  Schools are instructed to place 
students in the  "least restrictive environment."  Today this policy 
is defined as full inclusion.  That means that the regular classroom 
must be the first option for all children with handicaps, and many in 
the education establishment, ignoring the fact that diverse needs require 
diverse solutions, are determined to make the regular classroom the "best 
option" by bringing in aides, special materials, equipment, etc.[26] As 
Albert Shanker has said,  "The argument on the part of inclusionists 
rests on the social benefits of education.  Some have even stated that 
they don't care if other children don't learn to read and write, if 
they have learned to 'get along.'"[27]

<p>

The federally mandated policy of inclusion presents an excellent 
example of why a federal Education Department is ineffective and 
inappropriate.  A single national policy cannot meet the needs of 
all students.  Nowhere is this more true than in special education, 
where a student's learning depends largely on how closely teaching 
methods meet his or her needs.  Those closest to the student with 
special needs -- parents and teachers -- should have authority to 
shape policy so it will be appropriate for that student.

<p>

Just as the U.S. Department of Education is poorly suited to the 
task of setting special education policies, it is poorly suited 
to the task of protecting the civil rights of students.

<p>

Civil rights issues in schools today are not significantly different 
from those in any other arena of American life.  To guarantee 
students equal protection under the law, the function of preserving 
civil rights in schools should be moved to the U.S. Justice Department. 
Schools have broken the chains of discrimination, and minority students 
have made considerable progress as a result.  Indeed, one of the few 
success stories in American education in the last three decades is the 
reduced disparity in the relative achievement and graduation rates of 
white and minority students.[28]

<p>

In dealing with schools, the Justice Department must heed the advice 
given in 1981 to the Office of Civil Rights (OCR) in the Education 
Department:

<p>

<blockquote><i>

The civil rights of individuals are fundamental, and should not be 
abridged.  But the role of the OCR...needs to be narrowed so as to 
allow state and local education officials to develop programs which 
will take into consideration the unique situations of particular 
schools and school districts.  Guidance and assistance, not broad, 
heavy-handed mandates and regulations, should be the role of this 
division.</i>[29]

</blockquote>

<p>

<center><h3>Private Solutions</h3></center>

<p>

The federal lending program for post-secondary education should be 
privatized.  Government should concentrate its limited funds on 
"inherently governmental functions," insists Robert Poole, president 
of the Reason Foundation.   "It should separate policymaking and 
regulation from actual service delivery."[30]

<p>

The federal government entered the educational lending business in 
1972 when it chartered the Student Loan Marketing Association (Sallie 
Mae) to ensure access to student loans for post-secondary education. 
Many argue that Sallie Mae has accomplished that mission and should 
now be privatized.[31] The Clinton Administration appears eager to 
let the quasi-private Sallie Mae do just that so that it may conduct 
a lending program with the exact opposite character: direct lending 
by the federal government.

<p>

Instituted in 1993, the Federal Direct Student Loan Program "has done 
nothing to 'reduce the complexity of administering student loans, 
eliminate unnecessary costs, and provide better service to students 
and schools'" as it claimed it would, according to Allyson Tucker of 
the Heritage Foundation.[32]

<p>

Robert Poole calls privatization "a major worldwide trend,"[33] yet our 
government has chosen to espouse the failed economic philosophy that 
government industries are preferable to private ones.  Bankers are 
doubtful that direct lending will succeed.[34] With the Education 
Department's history of students defaulting on loans, their pessimism 
is not unfounded.  The federal government should get out of the lending 
business; it should also get out of the educational research business.[35]

<p>

The federal government need not be involved for national educational 
research to take place.  Indeed, the most commonly cited measurement 
of student performance -- the Standard Achievement Test (SAT) -- comes 
not from the federal government but from the Educational Testing Service 
(ETS) in Princeton, NJ.

<p>

<center><h3>Conclusion</h3></center>

<p>

Bureaucracies are what bureaucracies do. Goals 2000 and the Elementary 
and Secondary Education Act clearly show the intent of the federal 
Education Department to intrude further into local schools and usurp 
community responsibility. The history standards that the Department 
financed are so biased that the United States Senate renounced them 
in a 99 to 1 vote.

If there is one lesson of our times it is that centralization and huge 
bureaucracies don't work very well.  That truth swept away the 
governments of the Soviet Union and half a dozen other countries. 
People in all corners of the globe are moving to take control of their 
own lives back from distant bureaucracies.  Our own nation needs a 
renewal of the local spirit that Alexis de Tocqueville praised so 
highly in 1835:

<p>

<blockquote><i>

I know of no people who have established schools so numerous and 
efficacious, places of public worship better suited to the wants 
of the inhabitants, or roads kept in better repair.  Uniformity 
or permanence of design, the minute arrangement of details, and 
the perfection of administrative system must not be sought for in 
the United States; what we find there is the presence of a power 
which, if it is somewhat wild, is at least robust, and an existence 
checkered with accidents, indeed, but full of animation and effort.</i>[36]

</blockquote>

<p>

It's time to disestablish the U.S. Education Department and end 
the federal intrusion into America's schools.

<title>ON DRUGS: THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S CURIOUS SURRENDER</title>

<h1>On Drugs</h1>
<h2><i>The Clinton Administration's Curious Surrender</i></h2>

</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>D</font>rug abuse among teenagers has risen significantly 
in recent years.  A nationwide survey by the National Institute on Drug 
Abuse (NIDA) found that between 1991 and 1994 annual marijuana use rose
from 6.2 percent to 13.0 percent among 8th graders, from 16.5 percent to 
30.4 percent among 10th	graders, and from 36.7 percent to 38.2 percent 
among 12th graders. Moreover, cocaine, crack, heroin, and LSD use among 
teenagers is also rising and may soon rival the high rates of the 1970s.[1]

<p>

Despite these trends, the Clinton Administration is leading an all-out 
retreat in the drug war. During the past two years, President Clinton 
has overseen the wholesale dismantling of government agencies that are at 
least partly responsible for the successes of the 1980s. The Clinton 
Administration has:

<p><ul>

<li>Dropped the drug war as one of the National Security Council's top 
priorities. It is now number 29 of 29.[2]

<p>

<li>Cut the drug czar's office by 80 percent from 146 to 25 personnel. 
It was partially restored by Congressional mandate.[3]

<p>

<li>Folded the State Department's Office of International Narcotics 
Matters into a potpourri organization that handles issues like labor, 
environment and population concerns.[4]

</ul>

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<ul>

<li>Left two key anti-drug positions vacant for at least six months: the 
drug czar and the position of Assistant Secretary of Defense for Drug 
Enforcement Policy and Support.[5]

<p>

<li>Cut military anti-drug efforts by signing an executive order 
drastically reducing the Pentagon's interdiction efforts. These cuts 
included 1,000 military positions devoted to anti-drug activities,[6] a 
move Rep. Charles Schumer (D-NY) called "a terrible mistake."[7]

<p>
	
<li>Cut drug interdiction funds for the Customs Service and the DEA. 
Today,	even though 70 percent of all cocaine comes to the U.S. via Mexico, 
the Customs Service does not routinely search for drugs inside semi-trailers 
crossing the border.[8]

<p>

<li>Reduced mandatory minimum sentences for drug traffickers.[9]

<p>

<li>Recommended, during his first-year budget, cuts in drug education 
(26 percent) and enforcement (15 percent).[10] Drug Czar Lee Brown learned 
of the proposed	cuts from an article in a newspaper.[11]

<p>

<li>Recommended merging the DEA with the FBI as part of the National 
Performance Review.[12]

<p>

<li>Cut 355 DEA agents and 102 personnel from the Justice Department's 
organized crime drug enforcement task force.[13]

<p>

<li>Cut the Coast Guard's drug interdiction budget by $14.6 million.[14]

<p>

<li>Terminated the DEA's drug kingpin program, which tracks international 
drug lords with the intent of bringing them to justice.

<p>

<li>Published a	report endorsing needle exchange programs intended to 
reduce the spread of AIDS and encouraged local governments to begin needle 
exchange programs.

agents off international beats and puts them in squad cars with local 
police. International drug smuggling, the intended target of the DEA, has 
not abated.[15]

<p>

<li>Cut drug treatment and prevention budgets by $100 and $130 million 
respectively.[16]

<p>

<li>Disbanded Operation Snow-Cap, which assigned DEA agents to assist 
anti-drug police in cocaine-producing nations.

</ul><p>

<center><h3>Bearing Responsibility</h3></center>

<p>

While it is certainly appropriate for policymakers to make changes that 
will improve the effectiveness of legitimate government programs (and these 
changes	will sometimes take the form of budget cuts, departmental 
consolidation and new priorities) a growing number of experts believe the 
Clinton Administration's drug policy changes are at least partly responsible 
for the recent increase in youth drug use and addiction.  For example, former 
First Lady Nancy Reagan told a Congressional committee in March 1995, "Why is 
it we no longer hear the drumbeat of condemnation against drugs coming from 
our leaders and our culture?  Is it any	wonder drug use has started climbing 
and dramatically so?"[17]

<p>

Former drug czar William Bennett stated, there is "no viable effort by the 
Clinton Administration to prevent the complete disintegration of foreign 
supply control.  This is an unconscionable abdication.  We face the real 
prospect of foreign nations permitting the unchallenged production and 
shipment of illegal drugs to the U.S."[18]

<p>

Former Drug Enforcement Administration director Robert Bonner stated, "I 
believe	that there has been a near total absence of presidential leadership 
by President Clinton in the fight to turn back illegal drug use in this 
country...It [the Administration] clearly fails to promote an increased 
awareness of the dangers of drug abuse, arguably encourages it...The 
Clinton	Administration's national drug strategy has failed miserably, and 
indeed it is a tragedy. The President must reverse this trend and start 
leading our nation's anti-drug efforts."[19]

<p>

Rep. Charles Rangel (D-NY) said, "I've been in Congress for over two 
decades, and I have never, never, never seen a president who cares 
less about this issue."[20]

<p>

Rep. John Conyers (D-MI) told Lee Brown during the drug czar's 
confirmation hearings, "Either the president is with you, or he has just 
given you a chair at the cabinet level...If it is the latter, you are 
getting ready to be the biggest fall guy in the Clinton Administration...We 
might as well close [the drug office] down and stop the pretense."[21]

<p>

Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) spokesman Wayne Roques, a 25-year 
veteran of the drug war, states: "The drug culture, sensing a weakening 
in our national resolve, has reared its ugly head and embarked on a 
well-financed, unconscionable campaign to legalize drugs."[22]

<p>

Attorney General Janet Reno has heard enough of the criticism of the 
Clinton anti-drug efforts.  She stated, "I would just suggest that it 
has come time to stop the political labeling of this fight and all of us 
join together in one common-sense, concentrated	effort that goes after 
the traffickers, that goes after the violence spawned by the drugs but 
provides education, prevention and treatment in a way that can truly make 
a difference."[23]

<p>

The nation's chief law enforcement officer makes a good point, but the 
Clinton Administration's actions send a very different message.  They 
represent a major philosophical shift from the Reagan/Bush years.

<p>

Presidential candidate Bill Clinton told the Democratic National 
Convention in July 1992, "[President Bush] hasn't fought a real war on 
crime and drugs, I will."[24] He promised to combine tough law 
enforcement with expanded treatment and prevention programs.  He also 
pledged to appoint a strong drug czar.[25]

<p>

Clinton's longstanding commitment to drug treatment is evidenced in his 
1995 National Drug Strategy.  He states: "The National Drug Control 
Strategy...confirms...my priorities for addressing this nation's 
continuing drug problem...This strategy gives those who	have fallen 
prey to drugs the opportunity to change their behavior."  His strategy 
focuses on treatment.[26]

<p>
	
The President told <I>Rolling Stone</I> reporters that drug treatment 
is "a big issue."[27] He explained his intent to "change the focus of 
interdiction to work on the roots of the exports to the United States" 
and "we decided to go ahead and put drug treatment into the 
health-care bill."[28]

<p>

Former drug czar Bennett points out that a successful war on drugs must	
balance treatment with prevention and interdiction.  The Clinton strategy 
is unbalanced.

<p>

<center><h3>Some Curious Appointees</h3></center>

<p>

Clinton appointees have orchestrated a campaign to liberalize the 
government's war on drugs.

<p>

For example, Clinton's first Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders created a 
firestorm when she responded to a question at a National Press Club 
luncheon by stating, "I do feel	that we would markedly reduce our crime 
rate if drugs were legalized."[29]

<p>

Her comments evoked reactions from many sectors. Senator Bob Dole 
(R-KS) said, "Americans must be wondering if the Surgeon General 
is hazardous to our health."[30] But Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke 
applauded Elders: "I think what the Surgeon General said was 
absolutely courageous and correct; there should be a study."[31]

<p>

While President Clinton sought to distance himself from Elders' 
comments, the Clinton Justice Department issued a study recommending 
reduction in mandatory minimum drug sentences.[32]

<p>

The DOJ's report, "An Analysis of Non-Violent Drug Offenders with 
Minimal	Criminal Histories,"[33] found that low-level drug law 
violators are much less likely to commit another crime than high-level 
defendants and that sentence length had no effect on recidivism	rates. 
The study recommends that the money spent on jailing low-level drug 
offenders could be better spent on other criminal justice needs such as 
more police.  

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
The Clinton Justice Department<br>
issued a study recommending<br>
reduction in mandatory minimum<br>
sentences.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

But the study has a number of problems. A "significant number" (43 
percent) of the 16,316 federal inmates in this study were non-citizens 
with unknown criminal histories.  This fact should have eliminated these 
inmates from the study.[34] In addition, the study failed to consider 
the impact that incarcerating low-level	drug sellers has on the illicit 
drug market.  Incarcerating convicted drug dealers sends a clear message 
-- drug trafficking has a price.  No one knows how many potential 
traffickers consider the price and turn to alternative employment.

<p>

Not only did the Clinton Administration call for drug legalization, 
but it also issued a 1993 report advocating needle-exchange programs 
even though these programs fail.  Before joining the Clinton 
Administration, Dr. Philip Lee was the principal investigator for a 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study released in September 
1993 which analyzed 37 needle-exchange programs.[35] The report, "The 
Public Health Impact of Needle Exchange Programs in the United States 
and Abroad," concluded[36] that "needle exchanges neither increase 
nor decrease levels of inject[able] drug use,"[37] and stated that 
"studies of the effect of needle exchange programs on HIV infection 
rates do not...and probably cannot provide clear evidence that 
needle exchange programs decrease HIV infection rates."[38]

<p>

Despite these findings, the report recommends:

<p><ul>

<li>"[T]he U.S. government should repeal the ban on federal funding 
of needle exchanges."

<p>

<li>States should repeal their prescription and/or paraphernalia laws 
banning possession of needles.

<p>

<li>Local communities should encourage the wider availability of 
sterile needles by allowing pharmacists to sell or exchange them.

</ul><p>

The Clinton Administration has encouraged needle-exchange programs, 
alleging that they will slow the advance of the virus that causes AIDS. 
Such programs, however, are not effective.

<p>

The much-publicized "Needle Park" (Platzspitz) experiment in Zurich, 
Switzerland was canceled after Swiss authorities concluded that	
needle exchanges promote crime, AIDS, drug abuse, and prostitution. 
After authorities closed the park, drug dealers and addicts moved the 
drug market to a formerly scenic bridge (named Lettensteg). The 
bridge was soon littered with thousands of discarded and probably 
contaminated needles and syringes. In February 1995, Swiss police 
fought a series of fierce gun battles to terminate Lettensteg's drug 
culture operation.

</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

A government-sponsored needle exchange program in New York City has 
met a similar fate. "Ever since the lower east side Harm Reduction 
Center, a needle exchange program, began operating in a storefront 
in a residential population of working poor, our community has 
witnessed drug abuse not seen since Operation Pressure Point cleared 
the area of drugs in the 1980s," one resident observed. "You can 
receive your government-sponsored clean needles (there is no limit 
to the number), rob and steal to get money for drugs (or sell your 
clean needles), buy cocaine in storefronts or heroin on any corner, 
then leave behind a pool of blood, dirty syringes, glassine bags, 
alcohol swabs and bottle caps....Statistics on the spread of AIDS 
cannot be the only criteria for measuring the success of the 
program."[39]

<p>

<center><h3>Interdiction Failures</h3></center>

<p>

The Clinton Administration has also failed to sustain an effective 
international drug suppression effort.

<p>

Brian Sheridan, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Drug 
Enforcement Policy and Support, told a House Committee in October 
1994 that the Pentagon recommended $135 million in counterdrug 
budget cuts.[40] The Pentagon has also cut at least 1,000 military 
personnel from drug interdiction programs and has terminated 24 
programs because of "insufficient utility."[41] Sheridan explained, 
"We must recognize that illicit drug use is a deep-seated social 
problem which, like the problems of crime and inner-city poverty, 
will have to be addressed by all Americans over the long-term."[42]
	
<p>

An equal threat is posed by drug lords in South America. The 
Colombia-based Cali cartel is a cocaine distribution network which 
includes a corporate headquarters and franchises throughout the United 
States.  It has effectively overwhelmed the Customs Service, Coast 
Guard and the DEA. It employs sophisticated production,	transportation 
and marketing efforts.  Some laboratories are the size of industrial 
factories, operating with the unofficial endorsement of host 
governments. There are ten entry point/distribution hubs in the U.S. 
The Cali kingpins or their operations chiefs oversee regional directors, 
who in turn supervise regional "cells."  And the cocaine comes to 
American shores	through contract carriers via air, land and sea.  They 
employ cargo jets, large tractor trailers which are seldom inspected 
at the Mexican border, and ships filled to the brim with tons of 
cocaine.  For example, a 14-ton shipment of cocaine was found hidden 
inside concrete fence posts and bound for Longview, Texas via Miami.[43]

<p>

DEA director Thomas Constantine told the House Judiciary Subcommittee 
on Crime, "[O]ur crime situation is controlled by foreign criminals. 
Marketing decisions made in Cali, Colombia or the highlands of the 
Golden Triangle have a direct impact on the drug trade in the 
streets of New York or the waterfront of Miami.  Highly organized, 
technologically-advanced criminal groups have come to dominate the 
production and distribution of heroin and cocaine destined for the 
U.S."[44]

<p>

Although Clinton's DEA chief, Thomas Constantine, pledged at his 
confirmation hearing to promote "the most effective [anti-drug] 
enforcement possible under the rule of law,"  Senator Orrin Hatch 
(R-UT) cautioned, "Some people are concerned there's a different 
attitude down there [at the White House] to legalize drugs."[45]
	
<p>

During Constantine's watch, the DEA has experienced serious personnel 
and budget cuts. He shut down operations for three weeks in early 
1995 to reorganize.  Constantine has also canceled Operation Snow-Cap, 
which had slowed the production and shipment of cocaine in the source 
countries. He has discontinued the TKO kingpin operation, which 
tracked drug lords and brought them to justice.  And now he has 
directed DEA agents to turn away from overseas and focus on the 
grass-roots level, helping police departments with street-level 
suppression.  The mobile enforcement team (MET)	program places teams 
of DEA agents in communities to assist police departments.[46]

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>

though these programs fail.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

These radical changes jeopardize the U.S.'s international interdiction 
effort and severely threaten the morale of an organization that has 
long defended our borders.  FBI director Louis Freeh told a House 
Committee on March 30, 1995, "If law enforcement is to stem or even 
slow the flood of drugs into this country, we must have a strong and 
effective presence overseas."[47]

<p>

To add insult to injury, DEA agents are subjected to Justice 
Department briefings that show how to properly use syringes to 
inject illicit drugs.  This training is part of the Clinton 
Administration's mandatory AIDS awareness training for federal 
employees.

<p>

Mr. Clinton promised to hire a strong drug czar. In April 1993, 
Clinton elevated the drug czar to the cabinet level, explaining, "I 
believe drug abuse is as serious a problem as we have in America."[48] 
Then he slashed the czar's staff 80 percent.

<p>

Clinton spokeswoman Alice Rivlin, deputy director of OMB, told a 
Congressional budget hearing, "It is not that drug policy is less 
important...On the contrary it is more important...The problem has 
been a lack of leadership, not the size of the staff."[49]

<p>

Selecting Brown does not match the President's promise to hire "a 
strong drug czar" or seek the right "leader."  Brown, a former New 
York police commissioner, left that post under the shadow of the 
Crown Heights riot.

<p>

After becoming drug czar, Brown was excluded from the White House 
communication loop.  In July 1993, White House budget officials 
accepted a major cut in anti-drug programs without consulting Brown. 
He didn't know about the arrangement until he read it in <i>The 
Washington Post</i>.[50]

<p>

<center><h3>Bad Company</h3></center>

<p>

President Clinton has surrounded himself with many counselors, but 
their wisdom with regard to drug issues deserves scrutiny.

<p>

Consider some Clinton advisors and their views on drugs:

<p><ul>

<li><b><i>Clinton's Minister.</i></b> On Sunday, April 10, 1994	the 
Clintons were at church like millions of other Americans.  That morning 
their regular pastor, the Reverend Walter Shropshire of the Foundry 
United Methodist Church, said he believed the government could create 
"a safer environment for all of us" if now-illegal drugs were legalized. 
He later explained, "I happen to have the belief that one of the things 
that we need to re-examine in our current society is the...legalization 
of some drugs.  And my belief is that if the economic portions could be 
cut out of the cocaine and heroin traffic, it might be possible to make 
a safer	environment for all of us."[51]

<p>

<li><b><i>Clinton's College Mentor.</i></b> Not only are some of Mr. 
Clinton's spiritual advisors sympathetic to legalization but so are 
some of his former academic mentors.  His former Yale law professor, 
Steven Duke, co-author of a 1993 book <i>America's Longest War: 
Rethinking Our Tragic Crusade Against Drugs</i>, advocates legalizing 
cocaine, including crack, marijuana and heroin.[52]

<p>

<li><b><i>Clinton's Campaign Advisor.</i></b> Mathea Falco was 
recruited by the Clinton/Gore campaign to advise on drug policy 
issues. She is the president of Drug Strategy, a non-profit 
organization funded by pro-legalization billionaire George Soros, who 
gave Falco's organization a reported $2 million in 1994.[53] Drug 
Strategy is a drug policy think-tank that supports the legalization 
of marijuana.

<p>

During the mid-1970's, Falco was a special assistant to the president 
of the Drug Abuse Council, Inc. and testified in Congress on narcotics 
abuse favoring a "broad" reassessment of drug policy and the review 
of the feasibility of decriminalizing marijuana	and "possibly" cocaine. 
She subsequently served as an Assistant Secretary of State for 
international narcotics under President Carter.[54]

<p>

According to the pro-drug periodical <i>High Times</i>, Falco worked 
closely with Peter Bourne, President Carter's drug policy chief who 
fell from power after he was found to have snorted cocaine at a 
National Organization for the Reform of	Marijuana Laws (NORML) 
party.[55] The magazine told its March 1993 audience that Falco believes 
drug interdiction does not work and that she would support medical use 
of marijuana and needle	exchange.  She was thought to be a candidate 
for the drug czar's job.[56]

</ul>

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<ul>

<li><b><i>Clinton's Advisors Reviewing DEA's Performance.</i></b> 
The Clinton Administration hired Mark Kleiman and Peter	Reuter to 
review the performance of the DEA.[57]

<p>

Kleiman is an associate professor at Harvard University's Kennedy 
School of Government and author of <i>Against Excess</i>, which includes 
an endorsement of marijuana legalization.[58] He was once a drug 
policy analyst for the Department of Justice and says that the 
primary goal of drug policy should be to limit the harms drug users 
do to themselves and the resulting harms to others.

<p>

According to <i>High Times</i>, Kleiman advocates user licenses 
for alcohol and pot and served as a graduate advisor for psychedelic 
researcher Rick	Doblin.[59] He spoke at a 1990 conference entitled 
"Regulation or Prohibition: Psychedelics in the	1990s."  In April 
1993, Kleiman spoke at a conference sponsored by NORML stating, "The 
hardest, intellectually, the hardest problem, I think, facing American 
Drug Policy is how to make the psychedelics available for their 
beneficial uses to people who can get benefit from them without	
increasing use under dangerous conditions, and abuse."[60]

<p>

In October 1994, John Carnevale, director of Office of Planning and 
Budget, Executive Office of the President, Office of National Drug 
Control Policy, defended the drug czar's decision to employ Kleiman's 
services. His organization, BOTEC, Inc., Carnevale said "has conducted 
a number of important studies over the past few years for ONDCP, 
especially in the area of monitoring the emerging heroin situation...At	
the current time, BOTEC's work, for whose timeliness and quality we have 
very high regard, continues to be the analysis of heroin use trends."[61] 
Kleiman is listed by Lee Brown as one of the many "expert individuals" 
to the drug czar for the 1995 National Drug Control Strategy.[62]

<p>

<li><b><i>Clinton's White House Staff.</i></b> All White House staff 
members require security clearances. Use of illegal drugs has long 
been a disqualification for a security clearance.

<p>

One of the first indications that drugs would be viewed differently 
by the Clinton Administration was the conduct of drug-testing for 
incoming presidential staff members.  The Clinton White House waived 
drug-testing until February 15, 1993 -- almost four weeks into the 
new administration.[63] By comparison, the Bush Administration 
required all new presidential aides to obtain negative test results 
before they could start work at the White House.[64]

<p>

The problem with staff drug testing continued for more than a year. 
In July 1994, then-press secretary Dee Dee Myers confirmed that one 
third of the White House staff still did not have "permanent 
passes."[65] This indicated a possible problem with drug-testing 
compliance. She admitted to being one of those without a pass, explaining 
she didn't have time to complete the paperwork.[66]

<p>

Director of White House Administration Patsy Thomasson oversees the 
security passes.  She once served at the right hand of an Arkansas 
investor, Dan Lasater, who pleaded guilty to federal drug charges. Her 
past association with a drug felon compelled the Senate to vote 98-0 
in June 1994 to require the president to certify that Thomasson	has 
no history of drug abuse.[67]

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<ul>

The suspicions about the White House staff linger. For example, the 
<i>Washington Times</i> reported in January 1995 that White House 
staffers have been seen	using drugs at parties around Washington. 
The paper quoted an unnamed source, "There's this private little 
social scene and everybody just assumes that no one's going to 
tattletale." Allegedly, one of the drug-using staff members works on 
the White House's National Security Council.[68]

<p>

Newt Gingrich ignited a firestorm on December 4, 1994 when he said, "I 
had a senior law enforcement official tell me that, in his judgment, 
up to a quarter of the White House Staff, when they first came in, 
had used drugs in the last four or five years...it's very clear that 
they had huge problems getting people through security clearances 
because they kept bringing people in who had a lot of things that 
weren't very easy to clear."[69]

<p>

White House Chief of Staff Leon	Panetta rebutted the allegation. "There 
is no one in the White House who uses drugs."  But according to 
the <i>Washington Times</i>, White House staffers who frequent the 
Oval Office were seen "passing around joints [marijuana cigarettes]" 
at a local party.[70]

<p>

An unnamed senior administration official said that Gingrich got 
the number right but the time period wrong.  He said that a quarter 
of the White House staff admitted to using illegal drugs at some point 
in the past, however, that's well below the national average of almost 
40 percent.  Miss Myers noted, "Only one employee has failed a random 
drug test and that employee was a career person in a non-policy	
role."[71]

<p>

As recently as March 27, 1995, Miss Thomasson told a Senate subcommittee 
that 11	White House staffers are in a special random drug-testing 
program because of concerns about "recent drug use."  She also 
acknowledged that volunteers without adequate security clearances have 
been given access to sensitive areas in the White House and added that 
92.2 percent of eligible staff members had received permanent entrance 
passes.[72]

</ul><p>

<center><h3>Other Pro-Legalization Allies</h3></center>

<p>

The Clinton Administration's retreat in the drug war has encouraged 
a wide range of pro-legalization advocates, including:

<p><ul>

<li><b><i>Ethan Nadelmann.</i></b> He heads a pro-drug organization, 
the Lindesmith Center, which is heavily funded by billionaire George 
Soros.[73] Soros is pushing the "harm reduction" agenda, which is 
widely viewed as a first step toward legalization.  Soros's goal "is 
to invigorate and support a broader debate on drug policy" and to shift 
from drug war to "drug peace."[74]

<p>

Nadelmann advances the notion that illegal drug use is a private issue 
and predicts that "in another five or ten years maybe the right over 
one's consciousness, the right to possess and consume drugs, may be 
as powerfully and as widely understood as the other rights of Americans	
are."[75]

<p>

Nadelmann told <i>Reason</i> magazine, "The replacement of the 
Bush Administration with the Clinton Administration was generally a 
good thing.  It brought in a lot of new blood, new thinking. Lee 
Brown is not what I would call a desirable drug czar, but he's no 
William Bennett, either. There's more room for consideration of 
alternatives."[76]

<p>

<li><b><i>Rep. Barney Frank (D-MA).</i></b> Congressman Frank told 
a 1994 NORML conference, "I think we ought to make smoking marijuana 
legal."[77] He also told a Harvard Law School conference titled, 
"Crime, Drugs, Health and Prohibition," that the government spends 
too much money to stop drug trafficking.[78] He told a radio 
audience, "We should give the money to drug treatment and local 
cops."[79]

<p>

<li><b><i>Eric Sterling.</i></b> He serves as president of the 
nonprofit Criminal Justice Policy Foundation and is a former counsel 
to the U.S. House Subcommittee on Crime and principal aide in 
developing parts of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 and 
the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986.

<p>

He currently works with the Centers for Disease Control and the 
D.C. Commission on Public Health and has been honored by the U.S. 
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the U.S. Postal 
Inspection Service. Sterling told a 1991 NORML conference, "Hi,	
I'm Eric Sterling and I'm a 15-year member of NORML and I'm really 
glad to be here to talk to so many of you...How many of you are 
stoned now?  Show of hands.  Honestly, how many of you are stoned 
now...about a quarter.  And I ask that question because I used to 
get stoned at NORML conferences	and it was my favorite, favorite 
times [sic] to get stoned."[80]

</ul>

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<ul>

Mr. Sterling was a guest speaker at the 6th Annual Conference on 
Drug-Free Schools and Communities.  Some attendees called for his 
removal based on his open advocacy of drug use.

<p>

He continues to speak out for drug legalization. For example, he 
was a guest speaker at the 1993 Fifth Annual Hemp Freedom Rally in 
Massachusetts and spoke at a pro-pot rally in front of the White House 
on January 21, 1993.  He led the crowd in chanting "Inhale to the 
Chief."

<p>

<li><b><i>Organizations like the Drug Policy Foundation.</i></b> 
Michigan drug czar Robert Peterson observed, "Groups like [the] 
Drug Policy Foundation are run by three-piece-suited guys, not dope 
smokers, and they say they don't support legalization, that they're 
just studying alternatives...But I think that's just to put a 
respectable front on what they are really doing, lobbying for 
legalization...I got hold of the agenda for one of their meetings, 
and it included discussions of money laundering and bank secrecy."[81]

<p>

The DPF	will award more than $1 million in grants to promote drug 
legalization programs. For example, in February 1995, DPF awarded 
$25,000 to Cannabis Action Network, which advocates marijuana use; 
$15,000 to NORML for National Medical Marijuana Day; and $3,000 to 
the National AIDS Brigade which	promotes needle exchange programs.[82]

</ul><p>

<center><h3>Conclusion</h3></center>

<p>

The Clinton Administration's actions and its advisors' reputations 
suggest a general lack of commitment to the drug war.  With drug abuse 
on the rise, the President must lead the nation in an all-out effort 
to turn the tide of drugs away from our shores and especially away from 
our children.

<title>THE ONE-HOUSE SCHOOLROOM</title>

<body>

<center>

<img src="/townhall/FRC/fampol/fampolbl.gif">

<h1>The One-House Schoolroom</h1>
<h2><i>The Extraordinary Influence of<br>
Family Life on Student Learning</i></h2>

</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>S</font>he grew up during the depression in a small mill 
town in the South.  Her father was a textile worker.  Her mother, a 
homemaker. She not only became the first member of her family to go to 
college, but she also went on to get a graduate degree, to teach high 
school chemistry, and to be named Teacher of the Year.

<p>

So, when Lydia Lowie was asked several years ago to give a
speech describing the most influential teacher in her life, most
expected the retired schoolteacher to wax eloquent about an inspiring
high school science instructor or a brilliant college chemistry
professor.

<p>

Instead, Lowie talked about her mother.  That's right, this
highly-accomplished schoolteacher who had for years paid dues
to a teacher's union that boasts, &quot;If you can read this,
thank a teacher,&quot; identified as her most influential instructor
a poor, simple woman with a high school education.[1]

<p>

While some might be tempted to dismiss Lowie's comments as
sweetly sentimental, the truth is mothers -- and fathers -- exert
far more influence over their children's intellectual development
than is commonly realized.  In fact, more than three decades of
research shows that families have greater influence over a child's
academic performance than any other factor -- including schools.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<font size=+1><b><i>

than any other factor -- including<br>

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Yet, curiously, almost all public discussion about improving
education in this country centers around school-based reforms
of one kind or another.  Unless and until our education debate
begins to focus on the family, significantly improving student
performance in America is likely to remain an elusive goal.

<p>

<center><h3>Family Matters</h3></center>

<p>

Just as Jed Clampett once discovered &quot;buffalo crude&quot;
while shooting for some food, much of the early research measuring
the extraordinary influence of family life on student achievement
was uncovered somewhat by accident.

<p>

In the mid-1960s, University of Chicago sociologist James
Coleman led a major research study designed to explain why students
in certain schools or in certain classes within a school perform
better, on average, than students attending other schools or other
classes.  Coleman's pioneering research weighed the relative influence
on student achievement of different school factors (such as per-pupil
spending and school size) as well as the influence of different
teacher variables (such as teacher experience and levels of education
completed).

<p>

While several school factors proved to have a modest effect
on student performance, they paled in comparison to the influence
of family background.  According to Coleman, there is a &quot;powerful
relation of the child's own family background characteristics
to his achievement, a relation stronger than that of any school
factors.&quot;[2]

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
What families</i> do <i>really matters.<br>
Differences in student learning<br>
are not determined simply by the<br>
quality of one's gene pool or by<br>
which side of the tracks one lives<br>
on. Instead, differences in child<br>
learning stem significantly from the<br>
values, habits, and relational<br>
dynamics at work within the household.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Coleman's research spawned a number of studies replicating
his work and building upon it.  These studies consistently confirmed
Coleman's chief finding that families exert considerable influence
over student achievement.  For example, a 1984 research review
by the National Institute of Education concluded, &quot;Extensive,
substantial, and convincing evidence suggests that parents play
a crucial role in both the home and school environments with respect
to facilitating the development of intelligence, achievement,
and competence in children.&quot;[3] A 1993 survey of the research
literature by Benjamin Bloom and his colleagues reported, &quot;The
home environment is a most powerful factor in determining the
school learning of students -- their level of school achievement,
their interest in school learning, and the number of years of
schooling they will receive.[4] And a 1994 report issued by the
U.S. Department of Education noted, &quot;Thirty years of research
show that greater family involvement in children's learning is
a critical link to achieving a high-quality education ... controllable
home factors account for almost all the differences in average
student achievement.[5]

<p>

What is especially important about this body of research is
that it consistently shows that what families <I>do</I> really
matters.  That is, the research shows that differences in student
learning are not determined simply by the quality of one's gene
pool or by which side of the tracks one lives on.  Instead, differences
in child learning stem significantly from the values, habits and
relational dynamics at work within the household.

<p>

Indeed, a research review published in the <I>Phi Delta Kappan</I>
found that the home learning environment has an effect on achievement
that is at least twice as great as family social-economic status
(SES).[6] A Study commissioned by the Toronto Board of Education
found that parental encouragement at home and participation in
school activities have a more significant effect on children's
achievement than either SES or student ability.[7] And Bloom and
his colleagues summarize their findings by observing, &quot;Parents
from a variety of cultural backgrounds and with different levels
of education, income or occupational status can and do provide
stimulating home environments that support and encourage the learning
of their children.  It is what parents do in the home rather than
their status that is important.[8]

<p>

<center><h3>A Stimulating Home Environment</h3></center>

<p>

What characterizes the home learning environment in which children
are most likely to succeed?  In a 1994 review of the research
literature,[9] Anne Henderson and Nancy Berla of the National Committee
for Citizens in Education reported that children fare best when
their parents:

<p><ul>

<li>establish a daily family routine (including regular bedtimes
and times to study);

<p>

<li>monitor out-of-school activities (particularly television

</ul><p>

That these &quot;home&quot; variables contribute to children's
learning should not surprise anyone.  What may surprise many,
however, is just how much difference &quot;home&quot; factors
can make.

<p>

Take, for example, family meals together.  While some might
consider this a rather trivial family ritual, several studies
have found the frequency of family meals together to be a strong
predictor of student test scores.[10] In explaining this high positive
correlation,  Chester Finn of the Hudson Institute says that consistent
mealtimes give parents regular opportunities to ask questions
about what kids are doing in school.  Mealtimes also give parents
regular opportunities to broaden children's educational horizons.
For example, Theodore Roosevelt's interest in public affairs
is said to have been cultivated by the rich dinnertime discussions 
his family regularly enjoyed when he was a boy.

<p>

Just as family interactions around the dinner table pay surprising
dividends, the number and variety of learning tools (books, tapes,
puzzles, encyclopedias, computers, and the like) in the home have
a far more profound effect on student achievement than is commonly 
realized. In his groundbreaking book, <I>School's Out</I>, Lewis 
Perelman of the Discovery Institute reports that data from the High 
School and Beyond Survey show that the number of learning tools 
available in the home is a much stronger predictor of academic 
achievement than factors such as whether parents expect 
children to attend college.[11] Moreover, Perelman argues that 
a much-publicized 1990 book by Terry Moe and John Chubb of 
the Brookings Institute underestimates the influence
of family factors on student achievement because it overlooks
data showing an extremely high correlation between schools with
high achievers and students who have an above average number of
learning tools in the home.[12]

<p>

Other studies also have found a high correlation between home
learning tools and student achievement.  For example, a report
issued by the Appalachia Educational Laboratory shows that apart
from fixed characteristics like family size and SES, student achievement
is influenced by variables like having books available, reading
to children, taking trips, and guiding TV watching.[13] A study of
third graders in southern California indicates that high achievers
are more likely than other students to spend time on homework,
to use the dictionary, and to take part in learning activities
with their parents.[14] And education analyst Ann Milne concludes
from her review of more than 100 studies, &quot;What is important
is the ability of the parent(s) to provide pro-educational resources
for their children -- be they financial, material, or experiential.&quot;[15]

<p>

Not surprisingly, the positive impact of home learning tools
is especially high when these materials are used in direct parent-child
interaction.  For example, a 1985 report from the National Academy
of Education found that the single most important activity for
building the knowledge required for eventual success in reading
is reading aloud to children.[16] Moreover, a 1992 study at the City
University of New York found that average IQ scores of low-income
preschoolers are boosted by nearly seven percentage points for
each day of the week that a mother reads to her child.[17]

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The benefits of parent-child verbal interaction can also
be seen in recent research showing preschoolers placed in full-time
day care settings often lag behind their home-reared peers in
language development.  What is the primary reason for the difference?
Young children at home spend much of their day interacting verbally
with people (particularly Mom) whose language skills are more
advanced, whereas kids in day care spend most of their day interacting
verbally with peers whose language skills are no more developed
than their own.[18]

<p>

<center><h3>Structure Counts, Too</h3></center>

<p>

To say that family practices and processes make a significant
contribution to child learning does not imply that &quot;non-process&quot;
family factors (such as family income, size, structure, genetic
make-up, and parents' education) are somehow unimportant.  Indeed,
Milne reports that research consistently shows &quot;that both
males and females from single-parent families performed less well
than those from two-parent families.&quot;[19] A University of California
study shows that &quot;parent inputs do reduce the proportion
of low achievers, but they do not overcome the disadvantages of
low income.&quot;[20] Studies of twins suggest that genetic factors
account for at least one-third to one-half of the differences
in IQ scores.[21] And a study of Los Angeles elementary school students
finds that &quot;home process variables, parental responsibility
variables, and family background circumstances <I>worked together</I>
to shape student achievement patterns (emphasis added).&quot;[22]

<p>

These and other studies indicate that certain family structures
and backgrounds facilitate child learning more than others.  And
they suggest that the combined effect on student achievement of
&quot;process&quot; and &quot;non-process&quot; variables is most
apparent when either both sets of factors naturally pull in the
same direction (when, for example, highly-educated parents make
time to teach their children things at home) or when family roles
are adapted to facilitate home learning.

<p>

Consider, for example, the effect of family size on child learning.
For many years, researchers have reported that a child's learning
potential is threatened by the addition of new siblings to a household.
This notion that &quot;smaller families are better&quot; springs
from the fact that, in most American households, children are
primarily educational &quot;consumers&quot; taking from their
parents' learning resources, rather than significant &quot;producers&quot;
contributing to the family's overall learning environment.  When
children are given opportunities to contribute meaningfully to
the home learning environment, however, the negative effect of
increased family size can be eliminated  -- if not turned into
a positive.

<p>

That, at least, is one of the most important findings of a
fascinating 1992 University of Michigan study about the children
of Southeast Asian &quot;boat people&quot; who came to America
during the late 1970s and early 1980s.[23] This study found that
the refugee children's remarkable educational achievement (their
average scores were well above average in math and science, and
only slightly below average in reading and English) was due in
no small part to an effect similar to that found in the old one-room
schoolhouse.  Here's how the study's authors describe a typical
evening in a refugee home:  &quot;After dinner, the table is cleared,
and homework begins.  The older children, both male and female,
help their younger siblings.  Indeed, they seem to learn as much
from teaching as from being taught . . . [A] great amount of learning
goes on at these times -- in terms of skills, habits, attitudes,
and expectations as well as the content of a subject . . . Such
sibling involvement demonstrates how a large family can encourage
and enhance academic success.&quot;

<p>

Not only does this study of Indochinese refugee families challenge
prevailing assumptions about the educational impact of larger
family size, but it also challenges prevailing assumptions about
whether poorly-educated parents can contribute significantly to
their children's cognitive development.  Even though the refugee
parents had very limited English skills, they still enhanced their
children's literacy by reading to them.  In fact, &quot;the effects
of being read to held up statistically whether the children were
read to in English or in their native language,&quot; the University
of Michigan research team report.  &quot;This finding suggests
that parental English literacy skills may not play a vital role
in determining school performance.  Rather, other aspects of the
experience -- emotional ties between parent and child, cultural
validation and wisdom shared in stories read in the child's native
language, or value placed on reading and learning -- extend to
schoolwork.&quot;

<p>

<center><h3>Policy Implications</h3></center>

<p>

Just as it is important for families to appreciate the magnitude
of their influence over child learning, it is also important for
education officials to design policies and programs that envision
parents playing a major role in their children's cognitive and
moral development.

<p>

Unfortunately, this occurs far too infrequently -- in part
because education officials have far less control over family
structures and processes (thankfully!) than over school policies
and procedures.

<p>

Yet, if hopes for reversing America's education decline are
to be realized, serious attention must be given to the role of
families in improving student performance.  As Bloom and his colleagues
acknowledge, &quot;It seems most unlikely that a significant improvement
in the quality of education for all students can be achieved without
active support from other quarters . . . particularly families.&quot;[24]

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

a far more profound effect on<br>
student achievement than is<br>
commonly realized.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

To that end, three reforms are especially needed:

<p>

<b><i>1. Redefine &quot;parental involvement&quot; to give emphasis
to the role parents play as their children's first and most important
teachers.</i></b> While virtually everyone these days supports greater
&quot;parental involvement&quot; in education, few Americans --
including many parents themselves -- really believe it is critical.
If educating children is a pot luck dinner, then most Americans
perceive that schools provide the &quot;meat and potatoes,&quot;
while families contribute the dessert.

<p>

This analogy can almost be taken literally.  In many places
today, &quot;parental involvement&quot; is defined to include
little more than making brownies for school bake sales, being
room mothers for class parties, volunteering to chaperone school
field trips, serving on school advisory committees, and attending
open houses, PTA meetings, sporting events, plays, and musical
performances.

<p>

While no one would dispute the legitimacy of some -- if not
all -- of these functions, it is instructive that most of these
traditional parental functions do not center around learning.
Indeed, traditional definitions of &quot;parental involvement&quot;
do not fully appreciate the instructional contribution parents
can and should make to their children's cognitive development.

<p>

This is unfortunate, for the instructional role of parents
is not only very important, but is often more appealing to families
than other forms of involvement.  &quot;What appears to be a crucial
role for black parents is their role as teachers in the home,&quot;
notes Jacqueline Jordan Irvine in her book, <I>Black Students
and School Failure</I>.  &quot;It is the role that parents prefer
and the one directly related to the achievement of their children.&quot;[25]

<p>

In fact, Irvine believes part of the reason many parents are
apathetic about serving on advisory boards and in other traditional
capacities is because they perceive that their roles on such committees
are &quot;marginal&quot; and that their participation has little
or no direct impact on the achievement of their children.

<p>

These observations are echoed in a study of nearly 5,000 elementary 
school parents by researchers Steven Melnick and Richard Fiene.
In a paper presented to the American Education Research Association,
Melnick and Fiene report that &quot;parents did not want to be
part of a 'professional-client' relationship with the school or
to be patronized in any way.&quot;[26]

<p>

&quot;Parents belong at the center of a young child's education,&quot;
says former U.S. Secretary of Education William Bennett.  &quot;The
single best way to improve elementary education is to strengthen
parents' role in it.&quot;[27]

<p>

<b><i>2. Refocus &quot;educational choice&quot; to give emphasis
to the way in which it increases parental involvement in education.</i></b>
Currently, the case for giving parents &quot;school choice&quot;
often emphasizes ways schools would improve in a competitive free
market environment.  If parents easily could move their children
from one school to another, the argument goes, then schools would
work harder to educate students, thereby raising the quality of
all schools.

<p>

There is nothing wrong with this argument.  Competition would
improve schools.  That is a bedrock free market principle.

<p>

But this is not the only (or even the most) compelling argument
for adopting an educational choice plan.  Just as a break-up of
the government school monopoly is apt to affect supply-side behavior
and give us better schools, it is also apt to affect demand-side
behavior and give us better families. If genuine &quot;educational
choice&quot; existed, parents would be active, discriminating
consumers of various educational options rather than passive recipients
of schooling chosen by government planners using proximity-is-destiny
guidelines.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
This research argues for<br>
policies which facilitate<br>
greater parental involvement<br>
in children's lives -- not<br>
year-round, all-day, cradle-<br>
to-college school programs<br>
that leave little time for<br>
families to learn together.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Indeed, no longer would parents enjoy the privilege of blaming
the government for supplying bad schools.  With parental choice
comes parental responsibility.  Ultimately, parents would be responsible
for the decisions they make -- whether those decisions produced
positive outcomes or negative ones.

<p>

In such an environment, parents undoubtedly would devote greater
time and attention to considering ways to improve their children's
academic outcomes.  They would carefully weigh the advantages
and disadvantages of different educational options -- and carefully
monitor the outcomes of various educational decisions.

<p>

And so long as the resources with which they have to work are
fungible, parents would be empowered to consider and pursue all
sorts of learning strategies that might benefit their children
-- including some that lie outside the realm of conventional schooling.

<p>

<b><i>3. Replace the existing model of education, which is heavily
based upon late-19th Century norms, with a new model designed
to seize 21st Century opportunities.</i></b> Several months before
issuing its much-publicized 1994 report on parental involvement,
the U.S. Department of Education issued a separate report that
said America's schoolchildren are &quot;prisoners&quot; of an
outmoded school schedule.[28] Specifically, the report said that
the typical nine-month school calendar (which was originally built
around the annual agricultural schedule) hinders learning continuity
and requires teachers to do considerable review after summer breaks.
The report also said the average school day ends before teachers
have adequate opportunity to cover all the subjects contemporary
schools seek to address -- and before many employed parents arrive
home from work.

<p>

Based on these observations, the report called for lengthening
the school day and the school year.  It also called for expanding
early childhood programs directed at preschoolers, in the name
of improving school readiness.

<p>

While at first blush these ideas may appear eminently reasonable,
their collective thrust towards more schooling fails to appreciate
the fact that data from the National Center for Education Statistics
show that U.S. students already rack up more &quot;seat&quot;
time in school each year than their counterparts in Japan, Germany,
England, Italy, Canada, and Korea. (Compared to others, however,
time in U.S. schools is more likely to be devoted to non-academic
pursuits like gym, driver's education, counseling, and assemblies.)[29]

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
The result would be customized<br>
learning programs tailored to<br>
the unique needs of each child,<br>
with many part-time schooling<br>
options between the current<br>
polar opposites of 100 percent<br>
home schooling and 100 percent<br>
conventional schooling.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

More importantly, the drive for more schooling seems to be
at odds with the growing volume of research data showing how critically
important parental involvement is to children's learning.   Indeed,
this research argues for policies which facilitate greater parental
involvement in children's lives -- not year-round, all-day, cradle-to-college
school programs that leave little time for families to learn together.

<p>

Moreover, the most interesting educational trend in America
today -- the growth in home schooling -- is being driven both
by a frustration with rationalized, factory-style, morally-neutral
schooling and by a desire on the part of many parents to be highly
involved in the moral and cognitive development of their children.
What is especially interesting about this trend is the degree
to which some public school teachers have embraced it.

<p>

&quot;Family is the main engine of education,&quot; observed
junior high teacher John Taylor Gatto in a speech commemorating
his selection as New York City's Teacher of the Year. &quot;If
we use schooling to break children away from parents -- and make
no mistake, that has been the central function of schools since
John Cotton announced it as the purpose of the Bay Colony schools
in 1650 and Horace Mann announced it as the purpose of Massachusetts
schools in 1850 -- we're going to continue to have the horror
show we have right now.&quot;[30]

<p>

Gatto finds it &quot;curious&quot; that the literacy rate in
Massachusetts prior to compulsory attendance laws was 98 percent
-- seven percentage points higher than it has been at any point
since.  And he finds it &quot;curious&quot; that home-schooled
students score significantly better than their conventionally-schooled
peers on achievement tests.  Indeed, a 1990 study of more than
1,500 randomly-selected home-schooling families found that home-educated
students score, on average, at or above the 80th percentile in
all areas of standardized achievement tests.[31]

<p>

While conceding that we won't &quot;get rid of schools anytime
soon,&quot; Gatto says greater attention needs to be given to
facilitating learning opportunities that bring parents and children
together.  &quot;The curriculum of family is at the heart of any
good life,&quot; says Gatto.  &quot;The way to sanity in education
is for our schools to take the lead in releasing the stranglehold
of institutions on family life.&quot;[32]

<p>

Similarly, Seattle public school teacher David Guterson says
&quot;the notion of parents as educators of their children is,
in the broad sense, neither extreme nor outlandish.&quot;  Indeed,
Guterson points out that &quot;homeschooled children learn under
the ideal conditions that schoolteachers persistently cry out
for.&quot;[33]

<p>

In a compelling essay for <I>Harper's</I> magazine, Guterson
writes, &quot;Today it is considered natural for parents to leave
their children's education entirely in the hands of institutions.
In a better world, we [parents] would see <I>ourselves</I> as
responsible and our schools primarily as resources.  Schools would
cease to be <I>places</I> in the sense that prisons and hospitals
are places; instead education would be embedded in the life of
the community . . . Parents would measure their inclinations and
abilities and immerse themselves, to varying degrees and in varying
ways, in a larger educational system designed to <i>assist</i> them.
Schools -- educational resource centers -- would provide materials,
technology, and expertise instead of classrooms, babysitters,
and bureaucrats.&quot;

<p>

Guterson's vision of schools as interactive &quot;educational
resource centers&quot; is shared by Lewis Perelman, a former high
school physics teacher in New York state.  Indeed, Perelman believes
the era of conventional classroom-style schooling is coming to
a close, giving way to a variety of &quot;hyperlearning&quot;
strategies better suited to the computer-driven, information age
in which we now live.[34]

<p>

For families to be able to take full advantage of emerging
learning opportunities, Perelman believes school choice -- a one
time decision at the beginning of the school year -- will not
be enough.  Instead, he says parents will want and need to make
educational &quot;choices&quot; on an ongoing basis, much as they
do currently in other realms of economic activity.

<p>

Obviously, different families would answer education questions
differently, just as different families currently answer transportation
questions differently.  Some would lean heavily on do-it-yourself
strategies (driving oneself, teaching one's own), others would
depend heavily on outside services (taking the bus, enrolling
in classes).  But this model of education would be highly flexible
and adaptable.  Rather than offering a one-size-fits-all public
school monopoly, this new model would accommodate the different
needs and interests of different families.
<p>

The result would be &quot;customized&quot; learning programs
tailored to the unique needs of each child, with many &quot;part-time&quot;
schooling options between the current polar opposites of 100 percent
homeschooling and 100 percent conventional schooling.

<p>

<center><h3>Reviving Tuition Tax Credits</h3></center>

<p>

Quite appropriately, this new model would make parents the
principal educational decision-makers.  This doesn't mean that
parents would be experts in every educational subject any more
than consumers of microwave ovens are experts in microwave technology.
It simply means parents would be primarily responsible for the
moral and cognitive development of their 6-18 year-olds, just
as they currently are primarily responsible for the moral and
cognitive development of their children under the age of six.

<p>

And it means education policy-makers increasingly would need
to replace direct funding of schools with tax credits that empower
parents.  Tax credits are superior to vouchers as a means of empowering
families for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that
tax credits are more fungible.  Indeed, one of the reasons college
tuition expenses have increased at such a rapid rate in recent
years is because so many students partially or completely pay
for their higher education with non-fungible grants, loans, or
scholarships. Since college officials know that student aid
cannot be used for any other purpose, they have an easier time
increasing tuition expenses than would be the case if a larger
share of tuition expenses were being paid with cash that could
be used for other purposes.

<p>

How might a fungible educational tax credit initially be structured?
Perhaps the best plan would be modeled after the federal tax
code's current treatment of tax deductions. That is, the federal 
government could offer a &quot;standard&quot; educational tax credit 
of say, $400 per-child to all parents who have school-aged children, 
and an &quot;itemized&quot; educational tax credit option of up to
say, $1,600 per child would be available to families that
incur significant educational expenses for which they have receipts.
This would give all parents a hassle-free means of investing
in their children's education by doing things like purchasing
home learning tools (books, puzzles, computer equipment, art supplies,
etc.), and paying tuition expenses (for conventional classroom
instruction and/or for special learning opportunities like dance
lessons or summer camp).

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
If educating children is a<br>

Americans perceive that schools<br>

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Funding such a plan could come from the existing expenditures
made by the federal government for education-related programs.

<p>

State governments could offer similar programs, drawing upon
resources saved from lower enrollment in all-day public schools
and from other sources.

<p>

To be sure, these ideas would not be popular with teachers'
union leaders, federal education bureaucrats, and other parts
of the &quot;education blob&quot; as Bennett is fond of calling
it.  But folks like Keith Geiger (head of the National Education
Association) can't have it both ways.  If, as Gieger has argued,
&quot;the most effective and cost efficient place for children
to acquire the foundation for learning and moral values is in
the home,&quot;  then it stands to reason that solutions to America's
education problems ought to be primarily home-based, not school-based.[35]

<p>

Certainly, parental empowerment strategies would benefit children
coming from strong families.

<p>

But these strategies would also benefit children coming from
disadvantaged environments whose educational experiences would
become more &quot;customized&quot; as learning opportunities become
more varied and tailored to the individual.

<p>

To be sure, some children would still fall through the cracks.
But the grim reality of education in America today is that many,
many children are already falling through the cracks.  And many,
many more will do so in the future if we continue to focus our
education debate on schools instead of families.

<p>

&quot;We should think clearly about the problems of schools
[and] ask ourselves why every attempt to correct them seems doomed
to fail,&quot;  Guterson writes.  &quot;We should recognize that
schools will never solve the bedrock problems of education.&quot;[36]

<p>

Only families can. Only families will.

<p>

That is the lesson Guterson believes Americans need to learn.
If indeed we learn it, this time we really should thank a teacher.

<title>BEIJING'S AFTERMATH: A CLOSER LOOK AT THE U.N. CONFERENCE</title>

<body>

<center>

<img src="/townhall/FRC/fampol/fampolgn.gif">

<h1>Beijing's Aftermath</h1>
<h2><i>A Closer Look at the U.N. Conference</i></h2>

</center>

<font size=+3>A</font>fter much heated debate prior to and during the 
United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, China, the 
final Platform for Action was adopted on September 15, 1995.

<p>

What does the final document say?  And what are the implications of the
document for families, both in America and abroad?  This report
seeks to answer these questions as well as to shed light on the
inner processes surrounding the adoption of the Beijing Platform.

<p>

<center><h3>General Assessment</h3></center>

<p>

The United Nations spent $2.5 million to sponsor the Beijing
conference -- $1.8 million for conference services and $700,000
for public information.  Moreover, China incurred additional expenses
to host the event.  It took 12 days and a half-dozen committees
for the 4,969 delegates representing 189 countries to hammer out
the Beijing Platform for Action -- all the time under constant
pressure from 4,020 non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and
the watchful eyes of 3,235 members of the media.

<p>

The Beijing document, written over the course of two years, primarily
by NGOs from the old-line radical women's movement in collaboration
with several U.N. staff, arrived in Beijing with one third of
its text in brackets to show it was under challenge by various
government delegates.  (Brackets denoted areas of the text which
were disputed by government delegates.  No brackets could remain
in the final document.)

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<font size=+1><b><i>
What the feminists wanted<br>
from the Beijing conference<br>
was a redefinition of 'woman'<br>
in the radical feminist mold.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The document that emerged from Beijing was an unwieldy mixture
of ideas, reflecting, in part, the many different factions represented.
But by far, this &quot;agenda for women's empowerment&quot; was
most heavily influenced by radical feminists advocating a &quot;gender
perspective.&quot;  In fact, several prominent national delegations
were led by radical feminists -- notably those from the United States,
Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Caribbean and the European
Union.  These delegations demonstrated their determination to
extend international recognition of women's reproductive &quot;rights&quot;
beyond the Cairo Conference of 1994.

<p>

What the feminists wanted from the Beijing conference was a redefinition
of &quot;woman&quot; in the radical feminist mold.  They wanted
the U.N. to declare that women had a universal right to abortion
and that abortion was an acceptable means of family planning.
They wanted to enshrine the &quot;rights&quot; of adolescents
to information and medical services where sex and AIDS were concerned,
without the &quot;interference&quot; of parents.  They wanted
an endorsement of &quot;sexual orientation&quot; as an entree
for lesbian &quot;rights&quot; and, short of that, they wanted
the phrase &quot;in all its various forms&quot; appended to all
mentions of &quot;the family&quot; in the document, so as to make
way for non-traditional unions.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

What the feminists ended up with was something in between.  Abortion
was not declared a universal right nor accepted as a means of
family planning in the Platform.  However, controlling one's sexual 
and reproductive activity was declared
a &quot;human right.&quot;  Parents' rights were not completely
overruled, but they were subordinated to &quot;the best interests
of the child.&quot; Lesbian &quot;rights&quot; language was finally excluded 
at 4:45 a.m. the day scheduled for the adoption of the document, as weary
delegates looking for a few hours of sleep simply deleted all
references to sexual orientation from the document.  Nonetheless,
as Main Committee Chair Patricia Licuanan pointed out, this did
not change the fact that the day before, for the first time, a
lesbian had addressed a U.N. plenary on behalf of lesbian &quot;rights.&quot;

<p>

<center><h3>Issues in the Beijing Document</h3></center>

<p>

It must be acknowledged that the Beijing document contains some
positive aspects in that it denounces many terrible injustices
still suffered by women -- especially women in the Third World.
For example, the Platform denounces societies where son-preference
is practiced.  It spotlights poverty as a cause of women's suffering.
It condemns domestic battering and harassment in the workplace
and denounces forced prostitution, pornography, female genital
mutilation, bride-burning, sexual slavery and forced sterilization.
It condemns rape, especially as a weapon of war.

<p>

Still, as critics have pointed out, the document cultivates a
terrible moral and philosophic blindness to the human dignity
of women.  In many ways, the document is a monument to the &quot;exaggerated
individualism&quot; which characterizes the radical feminist movement.
It sees the role of wife and mother as impediments to a woman's
self-realization while refusing to recognize the harms, such as
disease and poverty, that are caused by irresponsible sexual behavior.

<p>

To take the issues in the Beijing document one by one:

<p>

<h4>1. Women's Roles</h4>

<p>

Despite the fact that 70 percent of the world's women are wives
and mothers, the Beijing document barely considers them in this
capacity.  Positive comments on women in connection with the family
are stuffed into a single paragraph (number 30), which reads:

<p><blockquote>

<i>

&quot;Women play a critical role in the family.  The family is
the basic unit of society and as such should be strengthened.
It is entitled to receive comprehensive protection and support.
In different cultural, political and social systems, various
forms of the family exist.  The rights, capabilities and responsibilities
of family members must be respected.  Women make a great contribution
to the welfare of the family and to the development of society,
which is still not recognized or considered in its full importance.
The social significance of maternity, motherhood, and the role
of parents in the family and in the upbringing of children should
be acknowledged.  Maternity, motherhood, parenting and the role
of women in procreation must not be a basis for discrimination
nor restrict the full participation of women in society.  Recognition
should also be given to the important role often played by women in many 
countries in caring for other members of their family.&quot;

</i>

</blockquote><p>

This paragraph is one of the few passages in the document which
speaks of women in connection with the family.  Another mention
(barely a nod) is paragraph 245b which urges that women's life
experiences, &quot;including, but not limited to their experiences
of balancing work and family responsibilities as mothers, as professionals,
as managers and entrepreneurs,&quot; be included in media depictions.

<p>

Elsewhere in the document, marriage is mentioned in a negative
way as, for example, in the context of dowry problems.

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<h4>2. The Family</h4>

<p>

While the March, 1995 Copenhagen Programme devoted an entire
section to &quot;the family,&quot; and the September, 1994 Cairo
Plan of Action included a chapter on &quot;the family,&quot; the
Beijing Platform for Action, the U.N.'s longest document discussing
women, almost completely ignores the subject. The only mention
of &quot;the family&quot; of any length in the Beijing Platform
of Action is in the same paragraph 30, mentioned above.

<p>

Before it begins discussing &quot;motherhood,&quot; that paragraph
says: &quot;The family is the basic unit of society and as such
should be strengthened.  It is entitled to receive comprehensive
protection and support.  In different cultural, political and
social systems, various forms of the family exist. The rights,
capabilities and responsibilities of family members must be respected....
The upbringing of children requires shared responsibility of parents,
women and men and society as a whole.&quot;

<p>

Paragraph 30 was one of the most hotly debated sections in the
document.  From the first preparatory committee meeting in Jakarta,
pro-life delegates struggled to guarantee language acknowledging
the importance of the family (in its traditional sense) both in
the lives of women and to society at large, as stated in the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights (1948).  Feminists, on the other hand,
insisted on using the phrase &quot;the family in all its forms&quot;
to allow for homosexual unions.  A compromise sentence -- &quot;In
different cultural, political and social systems, various forms
of the family exist&quot; -- was added in Beijing to take into
account the existence of single-parent families and extended families.
Even this compromise sentence, however, could be misinterpreted
to condone homosexual unions.  It could also leave the door open
for &quot;the whole village&quot; (or more precisely, the state)
to direct the upbringing of children.

<p>

&quot;Family&quot; is mentioned again (cursorily) in the Beijing
document (paragraph 93) as one responsibility among many in a
woman's life.  It is mentioned in paragraph 285, where the document
speaks of the family's role in promoting the equality of the 
&quot;girl-child&quot; and in paragraph 108c, where men are encouraged 
&quot;to share equally in childcare and household work and to provide 
financial support for their families even if they do not live with 
them.&quot; The few other mentions of &quot;family&quot; in the document
are very negative.  In paragraph 114a, for example, the family
is mentioned as the venue for battering, sexual abuse, marital
rape, female genital mutilation, and other acts of violence against
women.

<p>

<h4>3. Women's Health</h4>

<p>

The women's health section is the longest and one of the most
troubling.  It begins rhapsodically, with the statement, &quot;Women
have the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard
of physical and mental health... Health is a state of complete
physical, mental, and social well-being, and not merely the absence
of disease or infirmity&quot; (paragraph 91).  To this it adds
(repeating Cairo) in paragraph 96: &quot;Reproductive health is
a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, and
not merely the absence of disease or infirmity, in all matters
relating to the reproductive system and to its functions and 
processes.&quot;

<p>

To the point of neglecting most health problems, the document
concentrates on sexual or reproductive health.  AIDS alone gets
roughly 20 paragraphs, whereas cardiac disease and cancer are
mentioned only once or twice.  The document almost completely
ignores the problem of tropical disease which decimates female
populations in the Third World.

<p>

<h4>4. Reproductive Rights</h4>

<p>

The Beijing Declaration (paragraph 17) asserts that &quot;[t]he
explicit recognition and reaffirmation of the right of all women
to control all aspects of their health, in particular their own
fertility, is basic to their empowerment.&quot;

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
Lesbian 'rights' language<br>
was finally excluded as<br>
weary delegates looking<br>
for a few hours of sleep<br>
deleted all references<br>
to sexual orientation<br>
from the document.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

But the most stunning part of the Platform is its pronouncement
that women have a &quot;human right&quot; to control their own
sexuality and reproduction.  Paragraph 97 of the health section
declares that: &quot;The human rights of women include their right
to have control over and decide freely and responsibly on matters
related to their sexuality, including sexual and reproductive 
health.&quot;

<p>

Raising a woman's right to control her own sexuality and reproduction
to a &quot;human right&quot; is a considerable step beyond the
1993 Vienna Programme of Action's statement that &quot;reproductive
rights rest on the recognition of the basic right of all couples
and individuals to decide freely and responsibly the number, spacing
and timing of their children and to have the information and means
to do so.&quot;  It is also a considerable step beyond Cairo's
similar statement on the subject.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
The Beijing document<br>
contains some positive<br>
aspects: it denounces<br>
forced prostitution,<br>
pornography, genital<br>
mutilation, bride-burning,<br>
sexual slavery and forced<br>
sterilization. It condemns<br>
rape, expecially as a<br>
weapon of war.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The 1994 Cairo document had asserted that &quot;reproductive
rights embrace certain human rights that are already recognized
in national laws, international human rights documents and other
relevant U.N. consensus documents.&quot;  Moreover, the Beijing
Plan of Action had originally labelled controlling one's own fertility
&quot;a sexual right,&quot; but not &quot;a human right.&quot;
A woman's &quot;human right&quot; to control her sexual and reproductive
health could be understood to mean that she has a &quot;human
right&quot; to promiscuity, homosexuality and to abortion.

<p>

When this language was adopted in committee on September 10,
the Holy See was very concerned by what it saw as the invention
of a new &quot;human right.&quot;  At the conference and, more
recently, in the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> (September 21, 1995),
the Holy See delegation chief Mary Ann Glendon, an American and
professor of law at Harvard University, protested the Conference's
tampering with the Universal Declaration. &quot;All this is 
evidence,&quot; she said, &quot;of the increasing colonization of the 
great Universal Human Rights tradition by an impoverished U.S.-style 
libertarian rights dialectic whose features are (1) rights envisioned without 
corresponding individual or social responsibilities; (2) one's favorite 
rights (i.e., speech, property, etc.) touted as absolute while other
rights are ignored; (3) the rights-bearer is imagined as radically
autonomous and self-sufficient; and (4) the creation of new rights
which are often in conflict with one another (e.g., the right
to smoke versus a clean environment).&quot;

<p>

<h4>5. Abortion</h4>

<p>

Besides the disturbing paragraph 97, the Beijing document makes
no new inroads in promoting the legality of abortion.  Repeating
Cairo, the document says (paragraph 107k), &quot;In no case should
abortion be promoted as a means of family planning.&quot;  But
due to the precedent set at the 1994 Cairo conference, the term
&quot;reproductive rights&quot; in U.N. documents must now always
be understood to imply abortion in those countries where abortion
has been legalized.  Indeed, paragraph 107k continues by saying,
&quot;In circumstances where abortion is not against the law,
such abortions should be safe.&quot;

<p>

Despite the protests of pro-life delegates at both Cairo and
Beijing that abortion is never &quot;safe&quot; for the baby in
question, the Beijing document repeatedly condemns &quot;unsafe
abortions&quot; (which it defines as &quot;a procedure for terminating
an unwanted pregnancy either by persons lacking necessary skills
or in an environment lacking minimum medical standards&quot;).
For example, paragraph 95 lists &quot;unsafe abortion&quot; among
the consequences of early sexual experience, and paragraph 98
says that &quot;[u]nsafe abortions threaten the lives of a number
of women, presenting a serious public health problem.&quot; 
Paragraph 107k asks governments &quot;to deal with the health impact
of unsafe abortions as a major public health concern and to reduce
the recourse to abortions by increasing and improving family planning
services.&quot;

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
The document is a monument<br>
to the 'exaggerated<br>
individualism' which<br>
characterizes the radical<br>
feminist movement.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

During the negotiations in Beijing, the draft document's several
mentions of unborn life were either struck down or severely weakened.
In each instance where the document formerly mentioned &quot;female
foeticide&quot; (paragraphs 40 ,41, 115bis, etc.), the term was
replaced by &quot;prenatal sex selection.&quot;  But paragraph
276c which condemns son preference and unethical practices such
as prenatal sex selection and female infanticide, still adds,
&quot;This is often compounded by the increasing use of technologies
to determine fetal sex resulting in the abortion of female fetuses.&quot;

<p>

Also notable is paragraph 107k which calls on states to &quot;consider
reviewing laws containing punitive measures against women who
have undergone illegal abortions.&quot;  This paragraph also states,
&quot;Prevention of unwanted pregnancies must always be given
the highest priority, and every attempt should be made to eliminate
the need for abortion.  Any measures or changes related to abortion
within the health system can only be determined at the national
or local level according to the national legislative process.&quot;
(Given the restrictions on pro-life legislation in this country,
one has to wonder whether the U.S. is in compliance with this
language.)

<p>

Paragraph 107k also states, &quot;In all cases, women should
have access to quality services for the management of complications 
arising from abortion.  Post-abortion counseling, education and 
family-planning services should be offered promptly, which will also 
help to avoid repeat abortions.&quot;

<p>

<h4>6. Parents' Responsibility for Children</h4>

<p>

Despite the fact that Article 26 of the United Nations' Universal
Declaration of Human Rights states, &quot;Parents have a prior
right to choose the kind of education that shall be given to their
children,&quot; the Beijing document hardly acknowledges parental
authority over children.  Indeed, at least 17 references to parental
responsibility for children were deleted from the draft document.

<p>

For example, there is no longer any reference to parents' rights
in paragraph 107m, which asks governments to &quot;[e]nsure that
girls have continuing access to necessary health and nutrition
information and services, as they mature, to facilitate a healthy
transition from childhood to adulthood.&quot;

<p>

Parental rights language was also removed from paragraph 109(1),
which approves condom use for male adolescents.  (Moreover, despite
strong objections voiced by Catholic and Muslim delegates, a paragraph
asking governments to &quot;encourage abstinence as responsible
behavior until marriage&quot; was swiftly discarded at the Beijing
conference, at the urging of the Canadian delegation.)

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
Despite the fact that 70<br>
percent of the world's<br>
women are wives and mothers,<br>
the Beijing document barely<br>
considers them in this capacity.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The only vestige of parental responsibility which remains in
the document relates to the &quot;direction and guidance&quot;
of children.  But this weak language still disregards parents,
leaving most decision-making responsibilities to the child, including
(possibly) the decision of abortion.

<p>

In the end, the key paragraph relating to parents' rights and
children's rights turned out to be paragraph 267.  This  paragraph
reads:

<p><blockquote>

<i>

&quot;The International Conference on Population and Development
recognized, in paragraph 7.3 of the Programme of Action, that
'full attention should be given to the promotion of mutually respectful
and equitable gender relations and particularly to meeting the
educational and service needs of adolescents to enable them to
deal in a positive and responsible way with their sexuality,'
taking into account the rights of the child to access to information,
privacy, confidentiality, respect and informed consent, as well
as the responsibilities, rights and duties of parents and legal
guardians to provide, in a manner consistent with the evolving
capacities of the child, appropriate direction and guidance in
the exercise by the child of the rights recognized in the Convention
on the Rights of the Child, and in conformity with the Convention
on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.
In all actions concerning children, the best interests of the
child shall be a primary consideration.  Support should be given
to integral sexual education for young people with parental support
and guidance that stress the responsibility of males for their
own sexuality and fertility and that help them exercise their
responsibilities.&quot;

</i>

</blockquote><p>

Paragraph 108e  (about public health campaigns) takes the same
position, asking governments to:

<p><blockquote>

<i>

&quot;Prepare and disseminate accessible information...to ensure
that men and women, especially young people, can acquire knowledge about 
their health and especially information about sexuality and reproduction, 
taking into account the rights of the child to access to information,
privacy, confidentiality, respect and informed consent, as well
as the responsibilities, rights and duties of parents and legal
guardians to provide, in a manner consistent with the evolving
capacities of the child, appropriate direction and guidance in
the exercise by the child of the rights recognized in the Convention
on the Rights of the Child, and in conformity with the Convention
on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.
In all actions concerning children, the best interests of the
child shall be a primary concern.&quot;

</i>

</blockquote><p>

<p>

<h4>7. Religion</h4>

<p>

There is only one paragraph in the Platform for Action dedicated
to the role of religion in women's lives. This paragraph (25bis),
which in its original form cast religion as oppressive to women
(i.e., associating it with extremism and violence), was reworked
to acknowledge that freedom of conscience and religion are recognized
by the Universal Declaration.

<p>

Paragraph 25bis now reads:

<p><blockquote>

&quot;Religion, spirituality and belief play a central role in the 
lives of millions of women and men -- in the way they live, in the 
aspirations that they have for the future. The right to freedom of 
thought, conscience and religion is unalienable
and must be universally enjoyed.  This right includes the freedom
to have or to adopt the religion or belief of their choice, either
individually or in community with others, in public or in private,
and to manifest their religion or belief in worship, observance,
practice and teaching, in order to realize equality, development
and peace there is a need to fully respect these rights and freedoms.
Religion, thought, conscience and belief may, and can, contribute
to fulfilling women's and men's moral, ethical and spiritual needs,
and to realizing their full potential in society.  However, it
is acknowledged that any form of extremism may have a negative
impact on women and can lead to violence and discrimination.&quot;

Within the Beijing Declaration, paragraph 12 includes &quot;the
right to freedom of thought, conscience, religion and belief,
thus contributing to the moral, ethical, spiritual and intellectual
needs of women and men&quot; among rights to be protected.  And
on occasion, the document also appends a phrase such as &quot;consistent
with religious and cultural values&quot; (paragraphs 74, 82f)
to qualify injunctions to action.
<p>

<center><h3>Concluding the Conference</h3></center>

<p>

The Platform for Action was hotly argued for twelve days, sometimes
long into the night.  Negotiations about sexual and reproductive
rights as human rights went on sporadically for three days. Canada's 
Ruth Archibald led the five-day drive to remove the document's 17 
references to parental rights.

<p>

But by far the most important and moving proceeding for pro-family
advocates came during the four-hour marathon following the formal
adoption of the Platform on September 15th in which 42 U.N. member
states registered reservations to the Platform.  (These 42 comprised
a full fifth of the organization's membership, not what critics
had at one time called &quot;a handful of Latin American and Moslem
states.&quot;)

<p>

These reservations were especially important because they countered
the claims made by members of the U.S. delegation -- Tim Wirth,
Geraldine Ferraro, Donna Shalala, and health negotiators Nils
Daulaire and Dottie Lamm -- who, throughout the conference, kept
insisting that things were going smoothly.  The reservations also
served to refute the networks, the <I>New York Times</I> and Ford
Foundation representative Frances Kissling (Catholics for a Free
Choice), who, in a consistent stream of disinformation, claimed
that the Vatican was caving in on contraceptives and condoms.

<p>

Announcing its reservations at the conference, the Holy See opted
out of the health section in its entirety, on the grounds that
it concentrated on sexual and reproductive health to the point
of almost failing to address other women's health needs, including
maternal mortality and morbidity. It objected to ambiguous terms
concerning unqualified control over sexuality and fertility which
might be interpreted as an endorsement of abortion and homosexuality.
With regard to the whole human rights section, the Holy See associated
itself with very little besides the quotations from existing human 
rights documents.  It asked that its definition of the word 
&quot;gender&quot;(biological sexual identity: male or female) be affixed 
to the document when it was printed.

<p>

Islamic states clarified that, for them, sexual rights apply
only within marriage, and that they had not agreed to anything
condoning abortion.  Several stressed that the Platform for Action
would be interpreted in their countries according to Sharia (Islamic)
law, especially in regard to inheritance for girls.  The Philippines
objected to treating reproductive rights as human rights.

Malaysia said it would interpret &quot;family&quot; in the document
as the traditional family, and Ecuador said that the family is
the fundamental unit of society.  When the delegate from Niger
prepared to enter her reservation, she said publicly what many
developing country delegates had said earlier in private, &quot;We
hope that joining in the consensus will not be a pre-condition
for [donors'] financing of health programs.&quot;

<p>

In its final statement to the conference, the U.S. stressed its
commitment to the cause of women's empowerment and declared that
the Beijing Platform for Action would serve as a detailed map
for achieving women's equality, development and peace.  However,
neither the United States nor any of the other donor countries who so 
strongly backed the document have promised any new money for women's 
programs. They insisted that no new resources could be provided, turning
down the African and Latin American delegates who contended that
new and additional resources were needed to provide basic health
care to women, which was, for them, the overriding concern of
the conference.

<p>

<center><h3>Beijing's Implications</h3></center>

<p>

There is no doubt that the Beijing document will have consequences
for the family.  A year after Cairo, the first global survey made
by the U.N. examining its membership's progress to fulfill the
promises made in that conference's Plan of Action showed that
out of 53 nations surveyed, 46 have undertaken new policies to
implement the Cairo document.  The other seven nations were recorded
either as having lost ground in implementing the document or stayed
the same.  The U.N. Population Fund has also recently announced
that it increased its budget almost 21 percent in 1994 and another
17.6 percent in 1995, to a total of $312 million.  And plans are
already being considered for another U.N. women's meeting in 2000
and for a declaration of &quot;The Century of Women.&quot;

<p>

While the Beijing conference yielded few high points, one positive
result is that it drew together pro-family, conservative women
who for so long had resisted dealing with the U.N. due to their
general distaste for the organization.  In 1994, there were perhaps
two openly pro-life organizations among the NGOs at the U.N.,
but as recently as last April's PrepCom, there were 50.  The conference
in Beijing -- a long and very expensive journey from the US without
government or U.N. assistance -- drew over 200 women from close
to 150 conservative NGO organizations from 20 countries, including
Protestants, Catholics, Muslims and others.

<p>

Despite their late entrance and the fact that the feminists had
written most of the document, pro-family women became an important
part of the proceedings and undid a good deal of the damage that
preceded their arrival.  They supported pro-family delegates,
long-used to jeering and mockery.  They made the case for family
values on talk radio shows at home, telephoning from Beijing.
They even assisted delegates confused by inadequate U.N. translations,
patiently explaining code words like &quot;orientation&quot; and
&quot;gender&quot; to Third World delegates.  (Many Africans thought
that &quot;reproductive rights&quot; meant the right to have a
family.)

<p>

Most of all, these pro-family women were able to challenge U.S.
delegates on their partisanship, their lack of responsiveness
to the public, and their dearth of fidelity to traditional human
rights.  When the U.S. unfurled a banner demonstrating how closely
its commitments matched those of WEDO (a radical feminist NGO
led by Bella Abzug), conservative women raised another banner
made from a hotel bedsheet, pointing out where the U.S. had covered
its ears to conservative women.  So uncomfortable did the U.S.
delegation finally become with these new lobbyists that they called
in U.N. security guards to confiscate the conservatives' passes.
