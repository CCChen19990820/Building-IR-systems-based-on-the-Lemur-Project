<h3>Tune in to Talk Radio</h3>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Americans who think there's a liberal lilt to the news reporting they hear and read every day no longer have to rely on us cranky conservatives for affirmation. The evidence is now overwhelming. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	When asked their political philosophy in a recent survey, 61 percent of 139 Washington bureau chiefs and congressional correspondents said "liberal" or "moderate to liberal." Just 9 percent said "conservative" or "moderate to conservative." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Almost nine out of 10--89 percent--said they voted for Bill Clinton in 1992. This compares to just 7 percent for George Bush and 2 percent for Ross Perot. As for party affiliation, 50 percent said they were Democrats, just 4 percent Republicans.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	As for journalists nationwide, 56 percent of the 2,703 surveyed in a huge Los Angeles Times poll conducted in 1985 called themselves "very liberal" or "somewhat liberal." Just 18 percent said they were "very conservative" or "somewhat conservative." Several other studies by media analysts Robert and Linda Lichter, among others, have shown substantially the same. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Does this necessarily mean journalists allow their political beliefs to bias their news coverage? Of course not. But it sure raises certain suspicions when these cool, detached "professionals" get things wrong in a way that makes the conservative Congress look bad and the liberal White House look good. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Take just one example: the debate last year over reforming Medicare, the health-care system for America's 37 million senior citizens. Everyone by now knows that Medicare is rapidly going bankrupt and has to be reformed: There is no choice in the matter. But when conservatives <I>tried to slow down the built-in rate of increase</I> in Medicare spending--not cut spending, mind you, just slow down the rate at which costs are going up--congressional liberals accused them of making mean-spirited "cuts" that would hurt the elderly. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	How did the media respond? Although reporters were shown repeatedly that over seven years Medicare spending would increase by $100 billion over and above current levels--from $4,900 to $7,100 per person--the vast majority of media reports told readers and viewers that the conservative plan would "cut" Medicare. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Backtrack three years, to the debate over President Clinton's liberal health-care reform scheme. That plan would have increased Medicare spending at the same rate as the 1995 congressional plan. Yet, the media didn't assail the president for "cutting" Medicare. Like congressional conservatives, President Clinton took pains to make it clear his administration wasn't "cutting" the program, saying: "Medicare [is] going up at three times the rate of inflation. We propose to let it go up at two times the rate of inflation. That is not a Medicare cut." The media took the president's explanation at face value. Two years later, they pounced on Congress.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The double standard has become so obvious few bother to deny it. In fact, many observers are beginning to recognize that the "talk radio" phenomenon has come about precisely because there is such a wide gulf between what people know to be true and what the media frequently tell us is true. Would Rush Limbaugh have 20 million listeners if Americans had been hearing both sides of the issues for the past several decades? I doubt it. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Talk radio is the steam valve for political discourse in contemporary America. Liberals--not consciously, but effectively nonetheless--have been holding down the lid for decades. But the pressure became too great. Liberals stopped paying attention to one little outlet--AM radio--and all the steam came blasting out in a "rush" (sorry, I couldn't resist).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	 So next time a news report gives you the sneaking suspicion that the reporter is spending too much time chatting with Kennedy clones at liberal cocktail parties, you're probably right. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Then, for some balance, tune in to talk radio.

<h3>"It's The Economy, Stupid," Circa 1996</h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
May 16, 1996
<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;


	Presidential advisor James Carville, the highly regarded Democratic political operative from Louisiana's bayou country, helped keep the 1992 Clinton campaign in focus and "on message" with a simple four-word phrase, "It's the economy, stupid."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
If the White House is smart, this will not be its theme in 1996. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Though the White House and national media have been trumpeting the economy's "unexpectedly strong" (as The Washington Post put it) 2.8 percent first-quarter gain, this is modest growth by normal standards -- and voters remain uneasy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Flash back four years: With the American economy just emerging from a two-year recession in the fall of 1992 and many Americans nervous about their economic prospects, Carville's one-note samba -- played over and over again throughout the campaign -- clearly helped propel Bill Clinton into the White House, forcing George Bush to retire to his beloved Texas.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Now it's Bill Clinton's turn to run for re-election. And though the economy is not moving backward (the definition of a recession), it's not setting any speed records either. Fifty percent of major U.S. companies trimmed their payrolls in the 12 months ending June 1995, some of them significantly. Indeed, from March 1995 to March 1996, 325,000 high-paying manufacturing jobs disappeared, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The public -- especially the nearly 8 million people who are working two or more jobs to make ends meet -- know something is amiss. And they are concerned.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The administration's initial response was a mix of denial and cheerleading: the silly claim that the economy is the healthiest it's been in 30 years. The White House has had the good sense to back off a bit from this claim.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A new study shows why.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1078.html">study</a> was conducted by economists <a href="/heritage/staff/beach.htm">William Beach</a> and <a href="/heritage/staff/hodge.htm">Scott Hodge</a> using a highly reliable computer model of the U.S. economy. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	What the model does is simulate economic activity. By feeding the many "variables" that affect the economy into the model -- from changes in tax and budget policy to data on population growth and other demographic factors -- a seasoned economic forecaster can predict future economic activity.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Beach and Hodge turned the clock back to January 1993, before the new administration pushed the $241 billion tax hike through the 103rd Congress. Without getting into all of the mind-numbing technical details, they then ran the model on "fast-forward," asking it to tell them what the economy would look like today if tax and budget policy had not been changed in 1993.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	What they found was not good news for the White House.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	They found that another 1.2 million Americans would have jobs today if the economy hadn't been saddled with the tax increase. They learned that the U.S. auto industry would have built and sold an additional 1.1 million new cars and light trucks. And they learned that the typical U.S. wage-earner would have taken home an additional $2,600 in after-tax income.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The big numbers are equally disturbing. For example: The overall U.S. economy would have grown an additional $208 billion between 1993 and 1996. And business investment -- the key factor in creating jobs -- would have been $42.5 billion higher.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	While there has been some quibbling about the exact details of the Beach/Hodge findings, the overall thrust of their work remains unchallenged: Tax hikes hurt, and the huge 1993 tax hike hurt big time.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	If the Clinton administration wonders why American workers are still uneasy about the economy, they should tell the White House: "It's the tax hike, stupid!"
<p>

<h3>Your Right To Know</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a>
<br>
President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
May 16, 1996
<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Once in a while, someone comes up with an idea everyone can agree on. 	Michigan's Mackinac Center for Public Policy has come up with a way for all Americans to know exactly how much their employers have to pay the government  --  and for what -- in order to keep them on the payroll. It's called "The Right To Know Payroll Form."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	If your employer adopted this form, your pay stub would show every bit of money the government takes from your pocket each payday. And why shouldn't you have this information? You're a taxpayer and the government is supposed to serve you, not the other way around. These costs affect you directly. Who can object to your knowing? 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The "Right To Know" pay stub would tell you how much your employer paid: 1) to administer federal, state and local taxes; 2) to comply with mandatory programs like the Americans With Disabilities Act, Family and Medical Leave Act, Equal Employment Opportunity Act, etc.; 3) for unemployment insurance; 4) for workers' compensation; 5) for the employer's share of Medicare; and 6) for the employer's share of Social Security.        
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Did you know all that was coming out of your paycheck? Well, we're not through, of course. We haven't mentioned the rest of the items that would appear on your pay stub: 1) withholding for federal income tax; 2) withholding for state income tax; 3) the employee's share of the Social Security tax; 4) the employee's share of the Medicare tax; 5) withholding for local income tax. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	After all that is deducted from your earnings, you get to keep what's left. 	Just so you have some idea how your pay stub would look moneywise, take the example provided by the Mackinac Center, based on current tax rates. John Doe's two-week pay stub starts with an amount of $1,026.59, which represents the total amount his employer must put up to pay all the costs we mentioned, plus pay John Doe. 	
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	After the first group of costs listed above are taken out  --  in other words, the "hidden" money that vanishes before Mr. Doe sees a single penny, even on paper -- John is left with a gross of $916.67. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Now, take special note: The way John Doe's pay stub now reads, he has the impression that $916.67 is his total cost to his employer. Yet, the "Right To Know" payroll stub tells a different story: that his employer already has paid $109.92 to the government just to employ Mr. Doe. Every two weeks. And the same is true for every employee. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Then, all the rest is taken out  --  Social Security, income tax, etc. And what is John Doe left with out of a total $1,026.59? Just $686.67. Another way to put it: Before John could be paid $686.67, the government had to be paid $339.92.  	
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Well, now. Doesn't that seem like a lot? It does to me. Don't you think that if all Americans could see in this kind of detail exactly how much of their money is being diverted to the government  --  much of it before they even know about it  --  they might have a few more questions about why the government needs that much money and what is being done with it? 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	I do. In fact, I think every employer should give this sort of accounting to every employee.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	I suppose this kind of "better-informed citizenry" would make a few people in liberal, big-government circles just a wee bit uncomfortable. After all, people suddenly would see the hand of big government dipping into their wallets every couple of weeks, whereas before it was done on the sly. But liberal discomfort has never bothered me before. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	And it doesn't bother me now.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<title>Are Conservatives Winning Or Losing? -- Heritage Commentary</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3>ARE CONSERVATIVES WINNING OR LOSING?</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>April 25, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	When Ronald Reagan won the presidency in 1980, many Americans thought it was time to dance on the grave of big government. Instead, conservatives themselves bogged down in a bitter eight-year political war with dozens of special interests -- from farmers to welfare workers -- who depend on big government for their livelihoods. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	When conservatives took control of Congress in 1994, many of us again thought we had scored a victory for smaller government. Wrong again. President Clinton gave as good -- or better -- than he got from the new Congress. Despite rhetoric to the contrary, over the past year big government has continued to get bigger. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	It wasn't until the president's 1996 State of the Union declaration that "the era of big government is over," that I truly began to believe conservatives finally had won. After all, when an opponent is forced to mouth words he doesn't believe, words that go 180 degrees in the direction opposite his political leanings, in short, the very words his opponents have been saying, this is when he has lost the war -- at least the rhetorical war -- the war of ideas. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But conservatives will have to fight tooth and nail for every inch of territory they gain in the next few years. Liberalism has not surrendered; and we'd be naive to expect it to. After all, it's just too much fun spending other people's money. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In fact, those Americans who were really paying attention had a rude awakening following President Clinton's grand declaration about big government's demise. Untrue to his word, the president's first request to the returning Congress was for $8 billion in new spending for the current fiscal year. His fiscal year 1997 budget offered more of the same: a $358 billion increase over the levels proposed in Congress' seven-year balanced budget plan. <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	All these efforts will have to be strenuously opposed, and in years to come, gleefully overturned. In the meantime, conservatives will have to buckle down and think about what it means to govern. After all, the Republican Congress has encountered some rough going of late. Is this any surprise? Legislative governance -- that is, passing laws that do what you want them to do -- is not easy. It's like trying to herd cats.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Conservatives are unaccustomed to running Congress; they've been backbenchers for decades. This requires an adjustment. It requires a period of learning. There is nothing inherently disgraceful in the failure that comes from such learning -- except not learning.  	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Yes, the conservative agenda articulated in the House GOP's Contract with America remains largely unfulfilled. Perhaps too much was attempted. Perhaps compromise was dismissed too easily in the fervent desire for real change. Perhaps the message became too unfocused and thus susceptible to redefinition by the special interests and the media. These are understandable, forgivable mistakes. I say learn and move on.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	What do conservatives need to learn? For starters, when they campaign against each other in primaries, they have to stop attacking other conservatives for espousing great conservative ideas. For example, the defining issue of the 1996 presidential campaign should have been -- and still could be -- the <a href="/heritage/taxsite">flat tax</a>. One candidate, so intent upon defeating flat-tax candidate Steve Forbes that he was willing to say practically anything, called the flat tax idea "nonsense." 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Tell that to Hong Kong, whose flat-tax economy has been the most consistently expanding in the world for the last 30 years! 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The flat tax is one of the most marketable, most urgently needed -- by Americans of all income levels -- ideas conservatives have proposed in decades. Yet, in their pursuit of political gain, conservative candidates obscured the issue in a flurry of flying fur. <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Conservatism's message has been confused in the past year, by the rough and tumble of Washington politics. But that can be remedied. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Liberalism's message, on the other hand, has become utterly irrelevant to America's aspirations and values. It is beyond redemption. That's why liberals have to cloak themselves in conservative rhetoric just to get a hearing. This bodes well for the future of America. 
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The principles of conservatism -- free enterprise, limited government, individual freedom, traditional American values and a strong national defense -- don't change in the middle of a presidential election or a budget battle. They don't change whether Republicans are in power or Democrats are in power or whether that power is shared, as is presently the case.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	I am optimistic about conservatism because what we believe is enduring. I am optimistic because liberalism is a disaster that can no longer be disguised. I am optimistic because conservative prescriptions are based on sound economic principles and a realistic understanding of human nature, not wishful thinking. And I am optimistic because people genuinely want to get this country back on the right track. 
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The end result will be a more conservative -- and better -- America.

<title>Clinton's War on the Armed Forces - Heritage Commentary
</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center><h3> Clinton's War on the Armed Forces</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>April 25, 1996
<hr width=50%></center><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	President Clinton has said, "the era of big government is over." But so far, it looks like it's over for only one area of government -- national defense. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The administration is looking for a 6 percent cut in the 1997 defense budget. While that may not seem like much, it will further starve an already hungry armed forces wizened by nearly a decade of consecutive budget cuts.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Consider this: The president wants to cut procurement  -- purchasing of parts, machinery and equipment our troops use in the field on a daily basis -- by $3.4 billion. Yet, when adjusted for inflation, procurement is at its lowest level since the beginning of the Korean War. It hasn't been trimmed -- it's been hacked with a meat cleaver, by more than two-thirds in the last 10 years.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Now some of you may be thinking, "Hey, the Cold War is over. Communists are now nothing more than cabana boys in third rate dictator-run countries like Cuba. What could be wrong with a major downsizing of our military? The United States doesn't need to be a super power when there is no other super power to worry about."
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The only problem with this line of thinking is that while the magnitude of danger may be less -- no one threatens us with total annihilation the way the Soviet Union once did -- the volatility of danger is much greater. Rogue nations working to obtain nuclear and chemical weapons -- Iran, Iraq, North Korea and Libya -- don't care if the United States is a super power. All they care about is bullying their way onto the world stage -- and they're getting the weapons to do it.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In recognition of this, the Clinton administration itself has said that the United States needs to be able to fight and win two regional wars simultaneously. Yet, the White House has failed to provide the funding that would enable the Pentagon to meet this goal. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In addition to procurement, the Pentagon's "operations and maintenance" budget is being bled to death -- siphoned off into areas not related to combat readiness. Peacekeeping operations in Bosnia, Haiti, Rwanda and Somalia between 1992 and 1995 have cost American taxpayers some $6.6 billion. None of these missions contributed one iota to U.S. security.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In short, the American military is being weakened by starvation. Consider: In 1995 the Pentagon was not allowed to buy a single new tank. By the year 2005, every tank in the Army will be older than the soldiers driving them. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	It wasn't too long ago taxpayers were told that Pentagon chiefs favored hammers costing hundreds of dollars and toilet seats that should have been gold plated for what we paid for them. There was no excuse, of course, for such excess. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But essential investments in the day-to-day operations of our fighting men and women --  and combat readiness -- should not be confused with the waste of the past.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	President Clinton does the armed forces a disservice when our soldiers and sailors go without essential training because equipment is broken and there are no parts to fix it. Pentagon chiefs are now regaled with stories of maintenance crews "cannibalizing" other pieces of equipment to make Band-Aid repairs on equipment that has worn out.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The Clinton administration wouldn't have committed the United States to being able to fight and win two regional wars simultaneously if military planners didn't consider such a scenario -- say in Korea and the Middle East, for example -- a distinct possibility. But if the Pentagon isn't given the training, equipment, spare parts and supplies it needs, it can't fulfill this mission.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Or, our fighting men and women can be thrown into the middle of a conflict without the proper support, and we can just hope for the best.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Is this the administration's military strategy?   <P>

<title>Environmental Flip Flops - Heritage Commentary</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center><h3> Environmental Flip Flops </h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>April 25, 1996
<hr width=50%></center><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Liberal activists once again have used the occasion of Earth Day to scare people into believing the environment is in such bad shape that more government programs are needed to "protect" us. One favorite theme is the alleged global population explosion.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In the last five years alone, U.S. newspapers and magazines have published more than 7,200 articles on this subject. 	
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Now, the latest rave in environmental circles is a new book claiming a devastating drop in male fertility over the past half-century, threatening our very ability to reproduce. 
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
OK, so which is it? Are we about to overpopulate ourselves to death, or die out as a species? 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	As most Americans realize, environmentalists are constantly sounding the alarm about something or other. Fortunately, most of us know instinctively that a healthy dose of skepticism is in order -- that the doomsday stories are a bunch of baloney (itself alleged to be a health hazard, because of the chemical preservatives in the meat).  
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Virtually all of the stories involve highly complex scientific issues that a nonscientist can't possibly understand. Which is why its so important to put things in perspective. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The newest "danger" on the horizon involves a somewhat racy subject: sperm. According to the new book, various chemicals in our diets and environment are wrecking havoc with our genetic material, lowering global sperm counts to dangerously low levels and threatening the future of life itself -- man and animal alike.   
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	According to the overheated publicity materials being sent out by the New York publisher, studies have documented "as much as a 50 percent drop in human sperm counts over the last 50 years." Oh really?
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Predictably, supporting the book's claims (here's where perspective is important) are some of the same people who have been hollering the loudest about global overpopulation, urging the United States to support United Nations and Planned Parenthood birth-control efforts. Now, instead of financing condoms for Chile and Chad, America is supposed to do something about the fertility deficit in Fiji and France.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	This is precisely the kind of contradictory flip-flop confusion that raises skepticism about the entire environmental movement.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Of course, the agenda of environmental alarmists is the same as it has always been: Convince the American people that modern chemicals are deadly and evil and stampede the government into spending more money on more programs that will further restrict our choices and freedom.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The bottom line, of course, is that environmentalists can't have it both ways. We can't have a global population explosion and a fertility crisis at the same time. As Mr. Spock of "Star Trek" might put it, "It doesn't compute."

<title>Drifting Toward a Taiwan Crisis - Heritage Commentary</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center>

<h3>DRIFTING TOWARD A TAIWAN CRISIS</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
March 8, 1996
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In a blatant show of intimidation, the People's Republic of China (PRC) is now firing missiles at targets just miles from Taiwan's largest cities.
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The missiles are intended to undermine the Republic of China on Taiwan's democratic government -- which will hold its first-ever presidential election on March 23.  
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;And why shouldn't the PRC feel perfectly free to bully one of America's best friends in Asia and its 7th-largest trading partner? After all, the Clinton administration has done little to give China pause as to the consequences of such acts. 
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In fact, instead of clearly spelling out what America's response would be if the communist Chinese attack Taiwan -- thus discouraging such aggressive acts -- the blundering Clinton foreign policy team has lent encouragement to the Chinese. For example, an unnamed State Department official told U.S. News & World Report last October that U.S. military action was unlikely. "We would not be in a position to react with force," the official was quoted as saying. "We would not elect to do that, I'm sure," he added.
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Certainly not. Of course, a 12-year-old could figure out that even if this were true -- which it shouldn't be -- you don't go telling a potential adversary about it. 
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Clinton administration not only shouldn't be saying such things, this should not be its policy either. The administration should make clear to China that the United States will not tolerate an attack on Taiwan, period. Nor should it rule out the use of force if the Chinese decide on such a reckless course. In fact, instead of standing by while the PRC lobs missiles in Taiwan's direction, the United States should be holding naval exercises in the region: to send a message of our own. Instead, when the U.S. aircraft carrier Nimitz made a run through the Taiwan Strait in December, administration officials -- who could have just kept their mouths shut! -- were quick to assure all parties that the move was due to inclement weather in the Pacific. 
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;By failing to tell China's leaders where America stands, the Clinton administration is risking a clash that could enslave the citizens of Free China, place every U.S. ally in Asia at risk, and wipe out what little confidence our Asian allies might still have in our reliability in a crisis. 
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Before it's too late, President Clinton must make sure Beijing understands that America feels a moral obligation to defend Taiwan, and that it will do so, come what may. 
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;After all, the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act -- U.S. law -- states that America will regard any attack on Taiwan as "a threat to peace and security of the Western Pacific area and of grave concern to the United States." The president should reaffirm that it will regard violations of Taiwan's rights as a threat to U.S. security and will act accordingly. He should tell China it could face not only severe economic sanctions -- ranging from removal of most-favored-nation trade status to a full U.S. economic embargo -- but also the full military might of the United States.
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Such steps should be taken now, before the real shooting starts. After it starts, America can only lose. Even if a PRC-initiated attack on Taiwan didn't spread any further -- and there's no guarantee that it wouldn't -- China would have successfully challenged America's ability to protect its allies. Other challenges would follow, in Asia and elsewhere.      
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Of course, the reason China is threatening to come to blows is that it's scared of tiny Taiwan. Ever since ROC President Lee Teng-hui's private visit to the United States last June -- to speak at a class reunion at his alma mater, Cornell University -- China has been rattling its saber. Chinese amphibious and airborne military assault exercises involving 20,000 troops, 40 ships and 100 aircraft -- designed to simulate an invasion of Taiwan -- preceded the island's legislative elections last December, and even larger maneuvers are underway now. China fears that Taiwan will be seen as a model for political reform on the mainland, and is resentful of Taiwan's growing economic prosperity, based on a Western-style free market. 
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Most portentous of all, the PRC may be preparing for a more decisive confrontation with Taiwan in the future. In a speech Jan. 30, Premiere Li Peng said that "During the period [1996-2000] ... settling the Taiwan issue will be prominently put in front of all Chinese people." Reports out of Hong Kong in mid-January stated that "the important role to be played by the Army in taking back Taiwan," was stressed at a December meeting of the policy-setting Central Military Commission, attended by Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In the face of such challenges, President Clinton so far has chosen to hide his head in the sand. This makes America appear weak, not just to China, but to Taiwan and our other Asian allies as well. If America doesn't even have the nerve to talk tough to China before a crisis erupts, why should anyone believe we would defend Taiwan with force in the event of an attack? 
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There need not be a military crisis over Taiwan. All it would take to insure that it doesn't come would be some tough talk and a little saber rattling of our own. 
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;What's so hard about that?    
<p>

<title>Why the Budget Debate Matters – Heritage Commentarya</title>

<h3>WHY THE BUDGET DEBATE MATTERS</h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
February 15, 1996
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	CBO, OMB, baseline budgeting, reductions in the rate of 
growth.  To most Americans the budget battle between Congress and the White House has been 
impenetrable, a duel over accounting methods "explained" in acronyms only the initiated can 
understand.  No wonder many Americans are tuning out, or worse, focusing on the only part of 
the debate they can grasp -- the partisan sniping.   
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This is a shame. The budget debate is the most important 
political discussion this nation has had in a generation -- a debate over what kind of country we 
want the United States to be.  On one side are those who want the federal government to possess 
unlimited resources, the better to fix every conceivable social problem the country might face.  
For debate purposes, these are the liberals. On the other side are those who believe the federal 
government's power should be strictly limited, the better to preserve personal freedom and allow 
individuals to keep what they earn.  These are the conservatives.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The budget is the battlefield on which these two visions for 
America clash, and no issue highlights the divide between these two camps more boldly than 
taxes.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	For conservatives, the tax issue boils down to one simple 
question: Whose money is it anyway? If, as conservatives believe, the money people earn 
belongs to them, then taxes should be kept as low as possible.  Which means current tax rates 
need to be cut.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Liberals focus on a different question: How will tax cuts 
affect Treasury receipts?  The measure of tax "fairness" is not whether Americans are forced to 
pay too much, but whether the government has all the "revenue" it needs to run its myriad social 
programs. In this view, the American people not only have a duty to pay steep taxes, but should 
feel honored for the opportunity to help create utopia right here in the United States.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Or take another hot-button issue: welfare.  The debate is not 
about "ending welfare as we know it," as the president vowed to do during the 1992 campaign.  
In truth, we all want to end welfare as we know it: liberals, by increasing spending on a variety 
of programs that, after the Great Society's many failures, will finally (they hope) replace welfare 
with work;  conservatives, by spending less and weaning people off their dependence on 
"compassionate" government.  
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	On foreign policy,  the budget debate casts into stark relief 
serious differences over America's role in the world. It's probably true, as liberals claim, that they 
do not view America as the world's policeman.  In reality it's worse: They view America as an 
international welfare agency whose social workers (read: soldiers) can and should criss-cross the 
globe doing good deeds like keeping peace and building nations.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	None of this is said to disparage liberals as people.  With 
the best intentions they have guided -- or misguided -- our national policies for the better part of 
the 20th century.  But now liberalism is choking on its own political success.  It's overarching 
goal -- a vast federal government mobilized to redress all social ills -- has been achieved, but at 
the cost of almost $80,000 in public debt for every family in America. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Despite its continuing failure at the polls, liberalism refuses 
to go quietly.  In the current budget battle,  liberals have ruthlessly employed the only weapons 
remaining in their arsenal: fear and distortion.  For example, the proposed Republican balanced 
budget calls for a 7 percent annual increase in Medicare spending; liberals portray this as a 
"cruel" cut.  GOP efforts to return power and responsibility to the states are portrayed as a secret 
scheme to kill school lunches or hurt the poor.  And plans to rein in the spiraling costs of 
Medicare, which is heading for bankruptcy as sure as this is 1996, is depicted as an attempt to 
deny health-care benefits to the elderly.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	It is that kind of misrepresentation that betrays the fatigue 
liberalism is feeling these days.  It has no new ideas to offer, no agenda other than preserving the 
status quo.  For this reason the current budget battle may very well be one of the last debates in 
which 1960s-style liberalism even has a voice.

We were 35 minutes ahead of TWA Flight 800 on the runway at John F. Kennedy International Airport.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>But for a whim, we would have been on the later plane. A TWA flight to Rome, departing within minutes of ours, was cancelled. The Rome passengers were put aboard TWA Flight 800, to make connections in Paris. We were not aboard TWA because, at the last minute, our travel agent found a bargain on Delta.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Close friends and family knew of our destination, but few knew whether we were flying with Delta or TWA. When we arrived in Todi, our hostess had been up most of the night, fielding calls from our friends in America -- wanting to know what she knew.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>She had verified with a kindly Italian airline clerk that we were indeed on the Delta flight, that our names were on the manifest, that we probably watched "Grumpier Old Men" on the inflight movie. He reassured her and she relayed the news to America. We didn't learn of the TWA crash until we arrived in Todi.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>We settled into the enchanting stone house overlooking the Umbrian hills, and called home. We thought our family would like to hear our voices. We knew we wanted to hear theirs. We spent the next few days and nights swinging helplessly between polarities of alternating emotions, haunted by images of a plane exploding, plunging through the night into the dark sea, taking with it 230 men, women and children -- fathers, mothers, daughters, sons who would never see another day.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Frugality saved our lives. At least that's what we told ourselves. But we could not escape the eternal question, a soulful and frightening version of the tragic challenge: Why us? Or more to the point, why not us? Frugality is not a virtue that spares lives.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Indeed, the night after we arrived in Todi we went out to an especially fine, and expensive Italian restaurant and there we spent far more on food than we saved with the bargain on Delta.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Whatever we do now suddenly feels strange and precious. We are like children tasting a fresh fig for the first time, discovering the extraordinary in a blade of grass, a clay cup, a barking dog, the crunching sound made by the tires against the stones in the dirt road, the shapes of the white clouds scurrying across the sky as they begin to turn a beautiful shade of gray.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Everything is beautiful. Everything counts. We can't settle for the commonplace experience of a vacation. This vacation must mean something more. We feel compelled to testify to life, to our senses, to our appreciation of the world in all the wondrous variety of God's infinite gifts to man.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>We celebrate with fresh bread and old wine, the trivial and the contemplative. Whatever we look upon and listen to is nourishment for the soul, linking us with others through succor and sustenance.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Umbria is a special place to think about the inexplicable. Its earthy colors, punctuated by acres of sunflowers and threaded with cypress trees, is a region of gentle, verdant, undulating hills and valleys where St. Francis of Assisi fed the birds. He was a man of prayer and penitence whose poetry in praise of all living things is a lesson to us still.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>We rediscover the Sistine Chapel at St. Peter's. We look at Michelangelo's glorious fresco of God giving life to man. God barely touches man's fingertips and the spirit is suddenly tangible. We stand in awe of the vividness of the image, now illuminated in a gorgeous restoration of color. We ask again the eternal questions that haunt every thoughtful man and woman tormented for the answers to the questions about the meaning of life and death.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>We do not find the answers. We say a silent prayer for the passengers aboard TWA Flight 800 and mourn with their families. We leave the Sistine Chapel chastened and uplifted, sobered if not wiser. The forces of evil and terror wound deeply and destroy with enormous power, but such dark forces ultimately have no power to smash the human spirit. <BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Suzanne Fields, a columnist for The Washington Times, is nationally syndicated.<BR><BR><FONT SIZE="-2">Copyright &copy; 1996 News World Communications, Inc.</FONT>

<font size=7>Conservatism can close<BR>
Dole's gender gap</font><HR WIDTH=50%>
By Suzanne Fields<BR><FONT SIZE=1>The Washington Times
</FONT><HR WIDTH=30%></center><BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Bob Dole is obsessed with the gender gap. All the pundits inside the Beltway say so. His gaffes, his turn-arounds, his flip-flops, his misspoken attitudes and waffles over abortion, the assault weapons ban, and a less-than-enthusiastic attempt to trash the affirmative action quota schemes that discriminate against the innocent, are meant to reach out to the women's vote.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>They aren't working. He's looking through the wrong end of the telescope. He's right to show tolerance for those with different opinions on abortion. His choice of Rep. Susan Molinari, an unusual one, as the keynote speaker at least sharply contrasts to the Democrats who wouldn't let Bob Casey, a former governor of Pennsylvania, even talk about his pro-life convictions in New York in 1992.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Bob Dole's record as a pro-life senator shouldn't be discounted by pro-lifers simply because he has lately become inarticulate on the subject. But he desperately needs to re-focus on what pro-life and many pro-choice women agree on. A majority of women in both parties want to ban the infanticide procedure euphemistically called "partial-birth abortion." They want to be notified if their under-age daughter seeks an abortion.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Elizabeth Dole gave her husband good advice when she told him to look at crime as a women's issue. A majority of women favor the ban against assault weapons, but few expect it to have much impact on their lives. A majority of women, like men, want dangerous criminals locked up for longer. That's always been a strong Republican issue and Mr. Dole ought to ask Bill Clinton how he hopes to reconcile midnight basketball and curfews as an effective approach to crime. Such ideas are the work of an illogical mind and reflect a pandering politician.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Affirmative action hurts ambitious women, and there are lots of ambitious women in this country today. Furthermore, they vote. Bob Dole ought to gather the facts and talk to women who are naturally receptive to conservative fiscal solutions.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>One of the most fascinating stories lost in the debate over affirmative action is the way that women are smashing through glass ceilings. These women don't need affirmative action and, in fact, many of them could be hurt by it, especially those among the large numbers of female entrepreneurs with small companies who don't need meddlesome and burdensome government mandates.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Women own and run a third of the businesses in the United States and 40 percent of all retail and service firms. According to the Public Interest, magazine women-owned and operated firms grew by 43 percent -- almost double the rate for all firms -- between 1987-1992 under Ronald Reagan and George Bush. These women also increased their payrolls by 100 percent, compared to 38 percent for all firms in the same period of time.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Women who look up and see only their reflections in the glass ceiling usually have made "quality of life" choices that determined their rank. Those who got in and duked it out like men are closing the wage gap, rapidly. Working women between the ages of 27 and 33 who have not had children earn 98 percent of what a man earns. A 2 percent disparity isn't fair, but it isn't bad and it's certainly not difficult to close.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Women who continue to earn less than men in their fields usually have chosen to work less and take off more time, mainly for the children. Women are more willing than men to give more points to "home and family" in measuring success, whether they work or not. These women especially appreciate lower taxes.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Women, traditionally the moral arbiters of our society, are fundamentally conservative. Many are deeply offended by Bill Clinton on character issues and appreciate the integrity they perceive in Bob Dole. So far this moral outrage hasn't registered in the polls, maybe because Mr. Dole hasn't talked directly to them. Now is the time if he is ever to do it.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Suzanne Fields, a columnist for The Washington Times, is nationally syndicated.<BR><BR><FONT SIZE="-2">Copyright &copy; 1996 News World Communications, Inc.</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=6>The shattered fairy tale<BR>
of Charles and Diana</FONT><HR WIDTH=50%>
By Suzanne Fields<BR><FONT SIZE=1>The Washington Times
</FONT><HR WIDTH=30%></center><BR><DD>The marriage and divorce of Princess Di and Prince Charles
is a fairy tale for our time. Their story has all the appropriate literary
ingredients.<BR><DD>Prince Charming may not be as gallant as we like our princes to be, and we
don't know whether Cinderella turned out to be so terrific either. We only know that the shoe
fit.<BR><DD>Royal watchers chatter about the many ways Prince Charles and Princess Di were
mismatched, but the original Sleeping Beauty was mismatched with her prince, too. She slept
through the last 100 years. At least Di was awake in the 1980s.<BR><DD>There's also a jealous
Other Woman in the Di and Charles fairy tale triangle. Camilla Parker Bowles is a mistress of
the prince, not the mean stepmother, but she gets no sympathy from the rest of us and deepens
our empathy for the hardships endured by Di. The princess once remarked with bitter wit: "There
were three of us in this marriage so it was a bit crowded."<BR><DD>An angry Queen Mother also
pulls her weight against the princess, not letting her keep the title "Her Royal Highness."
That's a little like giving her back the glass slipper after it's broken, but at least she gets
to live in a palace.<BR><DD>Lots of fairy tales include dwarfs and rogues, unpleasant little
people who try to put something over on the princess and who frequently disguise themselves as
something finer. Does anyone doubt that Capt. James Hewitt, who kissed the princess and told the
world about it, and more, is such a stunted human being? The princess describes his "handsome
physique," but everyone thinks that such physical perfection must camouflage an ugly character
inside.<BR><DD>People in disguises in fairy tales are free to say outrageous things, half-truths
and lies, because the princess cannot see the wickedness within. Capt. Hewitt may later turn
into an ass, literally, reflecting his nature in outward form, but even without the tall ears we
can see that he's a donkey. When his tell-all book was published in London, Tory Member of
Parliament Sir Nicholas Bonsor said, "I cannot comprehend how he can still look at himself in
the mirror." Mirrors tell the truth. Snow White's royal stepmother discovered that to her
dismay.<BR><DD>I've been reading fairy tales (that's what happens when a grandson comes into the
family). Fairy tales are more illuminating and insightful during this pre-election season than
Bob Dole's inexplicable gaffes and Bill Clinton's "conservative" conversion pronouncements. One
man on the road to ruin, the other on the road to Damascus. (Read your Bible.)<BR><DD>I've
discovered what John Updike saw in a collection of Italian fairy tales: "They were the
television and pornography of their day, the life-lightening trash of a preliterate
peoples."<BR><DD>We're fascinated by the stories of Princess Di and Prince Charles for the same
reasons medieval men and women repeated fairy tales and for reasons these stories remain
popular. They're rooted in the reality of human emotion, both conscious and unconscious, an
awareness of wishes and desires that make us do strange and irrational things. They also grow
out of the culture and history of their time, at the upper reaches of society as well as what we
would now call the underclass.<BR><DD>No one -- certainly no one who has ever been part of a
couple -- believes any couple lives happily ever after, but it's fun to imagine they do. That's
no longer possible as newspapers, zoom lenses and an increasingly permissive society bring the
philanderings of the prince and the promiscuousness of a princess into our living rooms. You
might call this "defining deviancy up."<BR><DD>We no longer need to pretend that royal
personages act any different than commoners. But the British, unlike their American cousins,
must consider whether it's worth it to them to continue to support in such a lavish fashion a
modern royal family which creates such a cultural embarrassment. Americans may pay thousands of
dollars for faux pearls to turn Jackie Kennedy into faux royalty, but at least we don't pay
taxes to invent happy fairy tales we know aren't so.<P><I>Suzanne Fields, a columnist for The

By Suzanne Fields<BR><FONT SIZE=1>The Washington Times
</FONT><HR WIDTH=30%></center>
<BR><DD>We get the leaders we deserve. Such cliche may be glib but it's not without insight.<BR><DD>The character issue is dismissed as irrelevant and hence unimportant, and Bill Clinton holds a large lead over Bob Dole. Explanations, such as they are, abound.<BR><DD>First, Bill Clinton has been through a trial by fire and is no longer burned. We knew that he was no angel, but 43 percent of the voters gave him a plurality to win in 1992. So who cares?<BR><DD>"Filegate" may change the polls in ways that the conviction of his business buddies in Arkansas did not. But that's certainly not clear yet.<BR><DD>Character and politics seem to have little to do with one another. The Democrats have succeeded in sticking unfair descriptions of "extremism" on the Republicans. Bill Clinton knows how to read the polls and promise the American people exactly what they want, which is what a lot of the extremists promised first.<BR><DD>The rap on Bob Dole, who nearly everyone agrees is a man of character and integrity, is that he cannot turn his virtues into victory. He hasn't persuaded the American people why he wants to be president. Besides, "he's too old." That may be inaccurate, but it's a powerful perception nonetheless.<BR><DD>Hence, better to elect a deeply flawed young man than a decent "old" man. Sophisticated Europeans understand this amoral approach. They could never understand how a successful president like Richard Nixon could be brought down by the clumsy cover-up of a third-rate burglary.<BR><DD>But Americans have been a deeply moral people in matters of money, sex and power. When a leader shows lapses in any one of these categories, we react by electing someone who is dramatically deficient in those vices.<BR><DD>Gerald Ford, a stolid congressman, conspicuous for his ordinariness, restored a measure of confidence to the office of vice president after Spiro Agnew disgraced it by taking money under the table. Jimmy Carter had lust in his heart, but he kept it there, and he was upright and virtuous in his personal habits, a sharp departure from Jack Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson, leaders whose private behavior was unscrupulous, promiscuous or unprincipled, or all of the above.<BR><DD>Bill Clinton has surmounted scandals of sex, money, and power, at least so far. No one cares about Gennifer Flowers any longer and Paula Jones has been relegated to the wrong side of the tracks, beyond feminist concern. The Little Rock trials demonstrated that as governor Bill Clinton had criminal associates, but he has not yet been found guilty of anything illegal. Not yet.<BR><DD>In fact, the public appears to be extremely forgiving of Mr. Clinton. He could promise a middle-class tax cut in his campaign in 1992 and drop it completely after he won the election. He could seek the lifting of the arms embargo on the Croats in Bosnia, and once elected drop it. The voters don't care. Not yet.<BR><DD>Bob Dole supporters, down in the dumps about his poll ratings, insist that his ultimate integrity will win out if he's able to connect with powerful conservative issues that he has not yet articulated with any force -- slower growth in Medicare and Medicaid, balancing the budget, school choice, English as our binding language and a foreign policy that won't suffer from "misguided romanticism." But they seem to be trying to persuade themselves first.<BR><DD>A fascinating book called "Character Above All" measures 10 presidents from Franklin Roosevelt to George Bush on elements of character. The most provocative essay is by David McCullough, Harry Truman's biographer. He reckons that "character counts in the presidency more than any other single quality."<BR><DD>Could we find another president like Harry Truman? "Who knows?" he replies. "Maybe somewhere in Texas she's growing up right now."<I><BR>

By Suzanne Fields<BR><FONT SIZE=1>The Washington Times

<BR><DD>When Hillary Rodham Clinton is tempted to give in to self-pity, she ought to consider her sisters of earlier White House imprisonment. She and Eleanor Roosevelt were neither the first nor will they be the last to suffer outrageous slings and errors. Nor are they the most "victimized," in the fashion of the day. This pouring of new whine into old battles does not become a first lady.<BR><DD>She can consider herself lucky by comparison to Rachel Jackson, who was so vilified by the supporters of John Quincy Adams that she didn't live to move into the White House. She had wanted to skip the inauguration of her husband, but Andrew Jackson's friends warned that she mustn't give in to her tormentors lest they enjoy a "chuckle" at scaring her away.<BR><DD>She made plans to come to Washington, only to be reminded that her enemies not only called her an "adulteress" (and worse), but described her as "fat, forty, but not fair." Old Hickory himself was 61, but that didn't count. Buying a ball gown wasn't much fun. Rachel grew depressed and fell sick before she left Nashville, fulfilling a wish she had announced, paraphrasing the Psalmist, when she heard that her husband had won the election: "I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of God than to live in that palace at Washington."<BR><DD>If it's a seance she wants, Hillary ought to run a short circuit to Mary Todd Lincoln, who also dabbled in spiritualism, even before there was a Psychic Friends Network, believing that she had supernatural powers to communicate with dead relatives. But despite Mary's confidence in her own prophetic powers, she couldn't foresee how wretched she would be as first lady.<BR><DD>Although she was loyal to the Union cause, many of her relatives, including two brothers, fought for the Confederacy. She was accused of being a traitor and a spy. The newspapers were merciless, even when Will, her 11-year-old son, died. Instead of showing the first lady a little sympathy in her grief, the newspapers attacked the style and "extravagance" of her mourning clothes.<BR><DD>Not only did Mrs. Lincoln endure the assassination of her husband, but when she became a widow, a Lincoln biographer argued, probably inaccurately, that Lincoln had only one real love in his life, Ann Rutledge, a woman who died before he met Mary Todd. On reading this, Mrs. Lincoln broke down and was eventually placed in a mental institution by a son.<BR><DD>Florence Harding, like Nancy Reagan, consulted an astrologer -- as a senator's wife, not as first lady. But why not? It was "Madam Marcia" who told her that her husband would become president of the United States and he would also have many sordid affairs. Madam Marcia was right on both counts. Futurespeak has a downside.<BR><DD>Mrs. Harding, like Hillary Clinton, was furious at those who protected her husband from her. President Harding continued to see Nan Britton, a favorite mistress, after he moved into the White House, occasionally partaking of Nan's favors in a coat closet adjoining the Oval Office. Once when Mrs. Harding heard that that woman was in the White House she set out to find her, and only because someone tipped his Secret Service detail did the president and Nan escape the wrath of "the Duchess."<BR><DD>Nor is Hillary the first first lady to make personal and public sacrifices to protect her husband. Bess Truman learned early in the election year of 1948 that the White House was collapsing, rotting from within. Mrs. Truman preferred to bear the accusation that she failed to initiate a formal social season than to give her husband's enemies the metaphor of a crumbling White House. The Trumans moved into the Blair House after he upset Tom Dewey, and the White House was renovated.<BR><DD>Jean Houston, Hillary's psychic friend, suggests that she carries the burden of 5,000 years of subservience to men, and compares her to Joan of Arc. Bob Woodward writes in his new book "The Choice," that Hillary "seemed jerked around by the muddled role of first lady as she swung between New Age feminist and national housewife."<BR><DD>The first lady cut short one session with Jean Houston to inquire into Chelsea's tummy ache. Thus a child's aching tummy brought the burden of 5,000 years of "female subservience" abruptly to earth -- where it belongs.<P><BR>

<font size=7>The rising tide of 'Wifewater'</font></center><BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Hillary Rodham Clinton has done more for educating the public in the principles of modern feminism than Gloria Steinem or Betty Friedan, the early superstars of the movement.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>She climbed to the nexus of power using everything it takes. Like many male wheeler-dealers before her, she took ethical risks which, now that they have come to light, are like curses. Chickens coming home to roost.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>No wonder that she's taking a solo trip to Eastern Europe to celebrate the Fourth of July in Prague. Wicked wags in Washington say, unkindly, that she's looking for a country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the United States.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>For anyone who doesn't yet know her offenses, a quick read of the majority report on the Whitewater hearings will fill in most of the blanks. Many ethical lapses lead in and out of Vincent Foster's office and continue to fuel speculation not only about why he committed suicide, and where, but how his files mysteriously disappeared from his office with the help of Hillary's staff: "From the moment that she was notified of Mr. Foster's death," the committee says, "Mrs. Clinton and her key agents -- Margaret Williams and Susan Thomases --were engaged in the subsequent handling of documents in Mr. Foster's office."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>That means they dealt with papers about Whitewater and Travelgate that were -- and are -- potentially damaging to the First Couple, which the first lady knew were in Vince Foster's possession.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>What we have here is a pre-White House/post-White House scandal in which Hillary Clinton is accused of hiding or destroying documents from her law firm, and for holding on to files when they were subpoenaed by Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, two years earlier.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>"At every important turn, crucial files and documents 'disappeared' or were withheld from scrutiny whenever questions were raised," the committee charges. One of the most damaging bits of evidence are her fingerprints on the late-recovered billing records of the Rose Law Firm found in the White House residence last August. Although other fingerprints were found as well, the others are not those of anyone who was in that part of the White House the day the files were found.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>What's more, the billing records -- which Mrs. Clinton says she's "happy" were finally found -- reveal that Hillary lied about the amount of time she spent on the shady side of the Whitewater and Castle Grande land investments. She had the most to lose if the billing records were made public.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Naturally, the Democrats are trying to diminish the importance of her activities, attacking the committee report as blindly partisan. They'll have lots of time during the campaign to make their side of the argument. What may be more fascinating for the rest of us is to consider is how Hillary has played the cards handed to her, and its implications for the future course of feminism.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>What's abundantly clear is something many feminists are loath to accept. A woman in power -- however that power is obtained -- is little different from a man in power. She can use it for better or for worse, but being a woman has very little to do with it. Lord Acton's famous dictum applies to her, too: "Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mrs. Clinton gingerly slides back and forth into mini-feminine dramas, putting on pink and granting interviews with favorite reporters to talk about menus and White House decor. Such appearances are carefully orchestrated for maximum political impact. Just as a man will occasionally use his "sensitive" side to highlight how much compassion he has, he knows that really power resides in his tough positions. No man knows better how this works than Hillary.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>A chorus of friendly critics has frequently suggested that if only Hillary Clinton had come clean about Whitewater and Travelgate she could have quickly put it all behind her. This overlooks the possibility that maybe there was something to hide. You can only come clean if you are clean.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The First Feminist doesn't get the First Man off the hook, either. No matter what his wife did, Mr. Clinton as governor and then as president is responsible for her semi-official actions affecting the public good and bad, whether by arranging to have employees in the White House travel office cashiered, or in causing elderly blue-collar Arkansans to lose their savings in bad land investments.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The late, great Satchel Paige, who had a curve ball that could go around a mountain, used to say that it's dangerous to look back because "somethin' might be gainin' on you." If Hillary is brave enough to look back, she might recognize it.<P><I>Suzanne Fields, a columnist for The Washington Times, is nationally syndicated.<BR><BR></I><FONT SIZE="-2">Copyright &copy; 1996 News World Communications, Inc.</FONT>

<BODY>
</center><DIV ALIGN=Right><FONT SIZE=2><B>LONDON</B></DIV></FONT><BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>I've always enjoyed the comfort and easy convenience of the London underground. The tunnels and cars lack the grime, grunge and menacing quality we associate with most big city transportation. New York this is not. Not yet.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>But today the London subway is emblematic of the cultural changes that reflect a deterioration in manners, morals and civility that we've always associated with our ever-so-polite English cousins. Graffiti is everywhere. Litter is more prominent than it used to be. Rudeness is commonplace. A fear of violence lurks in spontaneous discourtesy.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>I boarded a subway car on June 8 with dozens of young men heading for an important soccer match at Wembley. They wore the black leather jackets of hooligans, swigging beer from cans, unshaven and loudmouthed, singing rowdy drinking songs.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>When two English bobbies boarded the same car, these young men switched to verses of "Old MacDonald's Farm," drawing attention to "the pigs" with a boisterous "oink oink here, and an oink oink there." The bobbies showed their customary patience and forbearance, holding steady lest a riot break out. But it was scary as well as shocking to feel adolescent intimidation kept in check only by police firmness.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The Brits worry about violence breaking out whenever their soccer team plays, and commentators are much in demand to lend historical perspective to bad behavior. But England is wary this month as it hosts "Euro 96," the soccer championships of Europe.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>One professor, who directs the soccer research unit at Liverpool University, traces the roots for modern hooliganism back hundreds of years, when young English working men went abroad to fight. This is to explain how the fighting spirit lives on in the shrunken psyche of a small island nation. But soccer as the Crusades? Others argue that violence and aggression among the lower classes are psychological compensation both for Britain's poor athletes and bruising social realities. Wobbly legs made me do it. Or maybe it was Lady Thatcher.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>After this mindless drivel how can it hurt for a foreigner to offer her instant analysis? What seems to be at work is a growing tolerance for anti-social behavior such as we thought was rampant only at home.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>I lived in London in the "Swinging Sixties"; I have no illusions about the coarsening of manners in the city once identified with propriety. But remembrances of the Beatles and Carnaby Street, miniskirts, mod ties and Chelsea mornings evoke a nostalgic high of innocence. We're talking about the loutish rebellion that has followed them.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Behaving badly, loud swearing and filthy insults, drinking and fighting in what the stylish English critics have dubbed the "New Lad" culture has been elevated to a lifestyle of perverse glamour that's begun to upset even the cultural elites that created the monster.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The defenders of nastiness and the violent underpinnings of the "New Lads" are in cowardly retreat, hiding behind the feeble defense that they never expected their irony and wit to be drunk straight up as it was "democratized down."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>"The New Lad style was taken up by a mass of young men who had little in common with their counterparts in Medialand," writes Cosmo Landesman, a critic bewailing the decline of civil standards in London's Sunday Times. "These were the prole-lad-tariat, and they had no interest in irony. Here was loutishness without the alibi of quotation marks. Now the middle class of Medialand are horrified by what they've unleashed."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Sound familiar?<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The first to speak out against moral decline in London, are, like their American counterparts, conservatives who were derided as "right wing" squares, cranks and old fogies. But old fogies have a way of cranking up influence over time. The starting point for most cultural and political debates in England -- as in the United States -- is right of center.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Recently Bill Clinton, ripping off another conservative issue, called for curfews for American children as a means to control violence by youngsters. The British Labor Party was inspired to quickly follow. But Tony Blair, head of the Labor Party, suffers the same problem (without the character issue) afflicting Bill Clinton. The farther he runs to the right, neglecting his core support, the more he risks becoming merely a bleached imitation of the political opposition.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Lefties in England face the same dilemma that lefties in the United States confront with our president. Can they trust their leader to run right and govern left? If not, why vote for watered-down conservatism? Good question.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Suzanne Fields, a columnist for The Washington Times, is nationally syndicated.<BR><BR><FONT SIZE="-2">Copyright &copy; 1996 News World Communications, Inc.</FONT>

By Suzanne Fields<BR><FONT SIZE=1>The Washington Times
</FONT><HR WIDTH=30%></center>
<BR><DD>The hip young man in khaki Dockers and the striped Henley has a problem. He's just met a young woman he thinks he might like a lot. But before he can unreel his line she tells him: "I'm into abstinence."<BR><DD>He's heard this lady's line before, at cocktail parties where nothing stronger than sparkling water of expensive vintage is served, on or off the rocks. Should he take it personally, or put it down to the luck of the draw? The third or fourth time he hears it he might wonder, is something else going on here?<BR><DD>Sometimes such a woman sounds like the incredible tease that every boy's mother has warned him about. But who, male or female, needs this or any other come-on in our sex-drenched age, when every man can be a libertine without even trying.<BR><DD>But wait: from almost anyone's circle of acquaintances among single women in their 20s and 30s comes a repeated refrain: They're tired of a man's great sexual expectations. In this game even liberty has its limits. A woman wants to get to know her man before she knows him.<BR><DD>Since the dawn of the sexual revolution, which was supposed to have put all aright, sex and not love has preceded intimacy, and the intellectual and emotional titillation that a man and a woman find in the first thrill of a romance has been reduced to days, sometimes hours. Some women, determined to regard themselves as gifts to the men they expect to love, call themselves recycled virgins. They're transformed in mind if not precisely in every aspect of body.<BR><DD>Premature mating, they believe, puts at risk the delicious journey of discovery that courtship provided for generations upon generations of young adults before them.<BR><DD>Few of us want to return to boy-meets-girl conversations on a front-porch swing with Mom, Dad, two brothers, three sisters and the neighbors looking on and listening in. (Nobody has a front porch, anyway.) Nevertheless, the easy flirtation of style over substance, with no guarantee of even a call the next day, may be becoming yesterday's weapon, the discarded Gatling gun in the war between the sexes.<BR><DD>The men in the trenches of this warfare want something better than a casual hayride, too. David Klinghoffer, who writes the "token man" column in Women's Quarterly, understood just how times had changed one Sunday morning when, on a Hamptons weekend with several other eligible young men, he found himself in the usual fight over the newspaper. Everyone reached not for the arts or book review sections, or even the sports pages, but for the wedding announcements. Who among their friends was lucky enough to be on the latest casualty lists from the front?<BR><DD>Many unattached young women so despair of finding Mr. Right they suspect themselves of the commitment-phobia they accuse young men of. How else to account for always choosing the wrong man, which ultimately keeps them free from a lasting attachment? Of course, with wrong men as plentiful as the mosquitoes on a summer's night at the lake, sometimes a girl can't help herself.<BR><DD>The Victorians, whose manners and morals are not always any longer a source of merriment for the sophisticates of our age, raised romantic love to elevated heights by introducing an element of the sacred into the pursuit of pleasure. They linked sensuality with divinity, sexuality with divine approval. A man regarded a woman as "saint-like," or "heavenly," an angel of light sent to restore his faith in life, love and marriage. Or tried to. Instead of sleeping together, courting Victorians attended church together. This required an appreciation of sexual abstinence and chastity, even if occasionally observed in the breach. They understood that romantic love without opposing resistance could have all the flavor of Juicy Fruit left overnight on the bedpost.<BR><DD>Julia in Byron's "Don Juan" linked remorse with temptation:<BR><DD>"A little still she strove, and much repented,<BR><DD>And, whispering 'I will ne'er consent' -- consented."<P><I><BR></I><I>Suzanne Fields, a columnist for The Washington Times, is nationally syndicated.<BR><BR></I> <FONT SIZE="-2">Copyright &copy; 1996 News World Communications, Inc.</FONT>

<BODY>


<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>I've changed my
treadmill schedule from the evening, when I watched "The News Hour with Jim
Lehrer," to the morning so I can get a sampling of the talk-show fare and stay in
touch with "real people" outside Washington. No offense to Jim Lehrer, but I can
watch him at night without the help of endorphins.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>But if my morning energy
level has gone up, my tolerance for talk television has sharply declined. In the weeks
since I began surfing for the morning shows the absolute worst, yet quite typical,
was about identical 10-year-old twins. Two girls and two boys were videotaped by
their parents showing how nasty they could be to each other, kicking and biting and
pulling each other's hair. Then we meet the twins live, in the television studio, to
hear and see them tell the audience why they hate one another. Each boy and girl
wish they weren't stuck with a horrible double.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>To give this junk morally
redeeming value, we're told that after the commercial break these twins are going
to want to shape up and learn the meaning of brotherly (or sisterly) love. When we
return we're introduced to the tutors for the twins.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>One is a tragic mother
who ran over her son, a twin, when he was 4 years old. She didn't see him as she
backed the van out of the driveway. She felt a bump and wondered if she had hit the
dog. She thought both boys were asleep upstairs in their room. Her son, sitting by her
side, describes almost inaudibly how lonely he is and wishes he could bring his
brother back. By now everybody is crying, the twins, their mothers and the audience.
I confess, me too.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>I've written about child abuse on television before and
this time I'm not even going to castigate the hosts of such shows. They only offer
what the guests and the public of the idiot culture will bear. But what can we say
about the exploitative parents of these children? Do they have no
responsibility?<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Maybe less should be written about the effects of television
sex and violence on children and more about the ill effects of putting children on
display before the cameras. This is a long way from "Sesame Street" or silly home
videos.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>We eagerly write child labor laws. We lock up pornographic
photographers of children. Isn't it obscene to portray children violently taunting
each other in scenes of sibling rivalry and then on cue parade their feelings before
their friends and millions of others?<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The last time I complained about child
abuse on television, it occurred on a show where children, ages 6 and 9, were trotted
out to explain how and why they wanted to kill their mothers. Greek tragedy this
was not.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The hosts usually make a pretense of offering such families "a
therapeutic environment," with bright lights and microphones, lots of supportive
gasps, sympathetic applause, and of course ample commercial breaks. Frequently a
resident expert is recruited to say that killing mothers is bad for their health, or
that beating up a sibling is not nice, either.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>These shows are sometimes
defended as "the democratization of culture," a harmless low-brow pleasure -- like
watching Christians being fed to lions? Or defended as giving those who don't have
much to feel good about an opportunity to feel superior to someone else: At least my
kids don't want to kill me or each other! They've even been called popular theater

producers, go I.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>But no matter how you look at it from an audience's point of

worry about the psychological impact on their lives.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Now that we've bid our
farewell to Phil Donahue, who started this abuse, we can wax nostalgic about a more
innocent time when the host merely wore a skirt and brought male strippers into our
homes. Tastelessness beats beating up kids.<P><I>Suzanne Fields, a columnist for

<BR><DD>Big Bob Dole and little Billy Clinton are strapping on the shootin' iron for the shootout at Gender Gap. Like the Clantons and Wyatt Earp at the O.K. Corral, they're itchin' to show the wimmen just who the real man is.

<BR><DD>Neither of these men strike any resemblance to Gary Cooper, to stretch the metaphor, but each is desperate to convince the ladies that he's a man who knows how to protect women, children and the community from bad guys in black hats.

<BR><DD>Women ought to find it offensive that any candidate thinks he can woo a woman on the basis of her &quot;gender&quot; (what in our pre-euphemistic days we called simply, sex.) But in a world where voting blocs are about differences, and women make up a majority of voters in almost every economic category, it can't hurt to target women. Picking up their votes is another matter.

<BR><DD>Bob Dole, who is looking for a quick fix for his depressing poll numbers, decides that women's issues might help him cross the finish line first. He cites day-care funding in the Republican welfare-reform bill, which Bill Clinton vetoed twice, as well as the balanced budget and regulatory reform, which are Republican initiatives that provide strong reasons why women should vote Republican in November.

<BR><DD>Bill Clinton, who is better at seducing women with his sensitive and puckered lower lip, is aggressively wooing blue-collar women, who voted in the presidential elections in 1992 but who stayed home in the 1994. Some women are harder to seduce than others.

<BR><DD>Blue-collar women in focus groups describe the president as a &quot;wussy&quot; and a &quot;pantywaist,&quot; according to Hanna Rosin in the New Republic magazine. They're not charmed by his boyishness or his chameleon-like changes. They're familiar with untrustworthy men who promise them moonshine at midnight and disappear in the harsh light of morning.

<BR><DD>These women, who have been described by pollsters as Angry White Women, do not have a college degree, and they're too smart to be impressed by Hillary Rodham Clinton trading on her husband's position to achieve the perks of power. High-powered patronizing women like the first lady are the nemesis of women who would rather stay home with their children than put their children in day care, if only they could afford it. Feminists who scorn men as white male devils make them uncomfortable; some of those men with pitchforks and forked tails happen to be their husbands.

<BR><DD>Blue-collar women are the biggest losers when public schools decline and they can't afford an expensive private school, like, for example, Bill and Hillary Clinton. They're a natural voting bloc for such conservative temptations as school vouchers, dumping affirmative action (which hasn't much benefitted them and certainly not their husbands), and illegal immigration which sometimes takes theirs and their husbands' jobs.

<BR><DD>Abortion is often not an emotional issue for these women, but most are appalled (like most of the rest of us) that Bill Clinton vetoed a bill banning partial-birth abortion (nothing short of infanticide), which liberal feminists railed at in China, but accept in our own country.

<BR><DD>If blue-collar women are angry and disconnected from feminism, middle-class mothers feel like Rodney Dangerfield, who &quot;don't get no respect.&quot; They're stressed to the max.

<BR><DD>A survey of more than 18,000 women for Parents magazine turned up some surprises. Sixty-eight percent of the working moms say they work for money, not emotional or intellectual satisfaction, up 12 points in seven years. Big majorities of mothers prefer part-time work to full-time work when their children are young. A mere 4 percent say they would choose full-time work. Though 49 percent of working mothers say they envy at-home moms, only 11 percent of at-home moms envy working mothers.

<BR><DD>Readers of Parents magazine make up a special sampling because nearly all of them live with their husbands, have been married only once, and more than half are college graduates. They are especially open to listen to Bob Dole's critique of the president for vetoing balanced budget proposals and welfare-reform bills. This would have put more money in their pocketbooks, to spend or save as they see fit.

<BR><DD>Most startling of all is the majority - the majority - of young mothers under 25 who say they prefer the lifestyle of the 1950s, the decade the feminists love to hate; 43 percent of these mothers say they long for the security and less pressured lives of that decade. A 24-year old mom captured their sentiment succinctly, describing herself as a &quot;June Cleaver Wanna-be.&quot;

<BR><DD>Neither Bill Clinton nor Bob Dole will woo their votes. These women vote very much like their husbands, and aren't interested in life in Gender Gap.

<BR><DD>The baby boomers flooded the culture with post-pubescent rebellion: &quot;Never trust anyone over 30.&quot;

<BR><DD>Adults trembled and then surrendered. Now the boomers are on the back side of 30 themselves and their children are saying: &quot;Never trust anyone over 13.&quot;

<BR><DD>Brittany, 13, is typical. She lives in a small New England town where her parents moved to get away from big-city problems. The big-city problems have moved into their town and into their living room.

<BR><DD>&quot;What she watches and hears from television and her peers on the bus to school deprives her of childhood innocence,&quot; her mother tells me. &quot;We can't control the other children, but we thought we could control our own daughter.&quot;

<BR><DD>Brittany's parents put a &quot;family-code lock&quot; on MTV so she wouldn't watch too much television. But Brittany is bright and she broke the code. Retaliating, she put her own code lock on the &quot;Discovery Channel,&quot; her parents' favorite.

<BR><DD>On the way to school, one of Brittany's buddies laced a large Coke with vodka and passed it around on the bus. She wound up in the emergency room, dead drunk.

<BR><DD>What we have here is a variation of the inmates taking over the asylum. With computer-literate, media-saturated, middle-class children poised for revolt, it's more difficult than ever for parents to maintain their position of authority.

<BR><DD>Not so long ago we accepted terms like &quot;identity crisis&quot; as a normal stage of development that adolescents would be expected to pass through. But today young people are exposed to so much &quot;adult&quot; information without the emotional development or psychological security to cope with it that parents are terrified.

<BR><DD>We look for one-shot elixirs to enable them to cope. We try to prevent teen-age pregnancy by distributing condoms at school. That sounds reasonable, but it plays to the lowest common denominator among us. The girl who would say &quot;no&quot; because she's afraid to get pregnant is reminded that the school provides condoms for squeamish young girls just like herself. How could it be bad?

<BR><DD>Movie and television producers, sensing a growing movement for censorship, offer ratings so parents will know what their children shouldn't watch. That only makes such shows and movies more desirable, of course, and the children quickly find the latchkey kid with no supervision at home. They hang out there to watch whatever they want.

<BR><DD>Most of us remember our own teen-age traumas and figure that those of our children will pass, too. But parents raising teen-agers today can't be so sure. The starting place for belligerence is so far beyond where the baby-boomer parents ended their rebellion that the test of limits is limitless. Today's teen-agers tolerate graphic sexuality and violence that would have made their parents throw up.

<BR><DD>Children are entering puberty at younger ages, some as early as 10. They're more likely to want to separate themselves from their families when parental protection is absolutely essential. Their mothers burned their bras; their daughters never get one. Young girls of another generation who would debate who to go out with, and &quot;how far to go,&quot; now debate when and with whom to have uncommitted and casual sex.

<BR><DD>We could begin to change some of this by pointing out that rhetorical and abstract appeals to sexual equality are false and misleading, hiding a multitude of dangerous differences starting at puberty. What once made up a teen-ager's fantasy life quickly became a short cut to coarsened reality. Parents must repeat and re-establish moral principles that reinforce an understanding of the difference between the sexes, enabling young women to once more become the arbiters of what's acceptable and what's not, because they're the ones who have the most to lose.

<BR><DD>This started out to be a column about the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act, pending in Congress, which is an attempt to give parents a veto power over policies in schools that they say undermine them. It sounds good, but it won't take the place of parents paying close attention to their own children. Nothing else, in the end, will work.

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE=7>Time for another<BR>killer euphemism?</FONT><HR WIDTH=50%>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><Align=center>
By Suzanne Fields<BR><FONT SIZE=1><Align=center>The Washington Times
</FONT><HR WIDTH=30%></center>
<BODY>

<BR><DD>In 1789 Jonathan Swift bewailed the shameful numbers of abortions and murders of &quot;bastard children&quot; among the Catholic peasants of Ireland, desperate women who sacrificed innocent babes to avoid the expense and the shame of giving birth without benefit of clergy. Such horrid practices, Swift wrote, &quot;would move tears and pity in the most savage and inhuman beast.&quot;

<BR><DD>In searching for a way to alleviate such cruelty, Swift invents an American, whom most Englishmen regarded as a not-so-noble savage, to support his modest proposal.

<BR><DD>&quot;I have been assured by a very knowing American of my acquaintance in London,&quot; he writes in a satire that became a classic of English literature, &quot;that a young healthy child well nursed is at a year old a most delicious, nourishing, and wholesome food whether stewed, roasted, baked, or boiled; and I make no doubt that it will equally serve in a fricassee or a ragout.&quot;

<BR><DD>Swift was only ahead of his time, and he was only kidding. His modest proposal was deliciously sly in appealing to an impeccable financial logic. His classic was a dig at the rapacious absentee English landlords of Ireland, whose money-grubbing tactics were condoned by the British parliament, ministers and the Crown.

<BR><DD>Taking a cue from Swift, the time is right for a similar modest proposal to President Clinton and all those congressmen who are willing to uphold his veto of the ban on &quot;partial-birth abortion.&quot;

<BR><DD>First the facts: a partial-birth abortion is the euphemism for the procedure of turning a baby around (with forceps) in the birth canal so that his tiny legs and tummy and arms escape the mother's body, allowing the doctor to stick a pair of scissors into his head while it is mostly still inside his mother's body. The doctor then spreads the blades of the scissors to allow him to insert a tube with which to suck out the tiny brain. Scientists who work with animals in a laboratory wouldn't be permitted to perform such nasty business.

<BR><DD>So heinous is the procedure that such abortions as are done are mostly to preserve the mother's health, usually her psychological health, since the procedure is done a few seconds before the baby's head slips free of the womb.

<BR><DD>And since psychology is so crucial, why should we deprive the mother-to-be of &quot;psychological closure&quot; by the technicality of keeping the head inside the birth canal while the procedure is being done? Why not do it outside, so that she can watch?

<BR><DD>Why not, in fact, provide a grace period of 15 minutes after birth, to allow her to decide whether she really wants to have a baby. Or even an hour. Perhaps a day or two. Why rush these things? The doctor's scissors would still work the next day.

<BR><DD>It's almost impossible to anesthetize an infant in the womb without putting the mother in great danger. But a baby who lives outside the womb for an hour or even a day could receive treatment to reduce pain prior to its execution. We shouldn't be barbaric, after all. The law, of course, must exempt this carefully considered procedure from charges of premeditated murder. We could give such infanticide a nice name like &quot;mercicide.&quot; The kindly Dr. Jack Kevorkian might offer the use of his death machinery.

<BR><DD>There is another great advantage to this scheme. By forcing the whole baby out of the mother's body for mercicide, we could decide at our leisure whether the infant is indeed a monster with four legs and no suitable brain, thus avoiding disposing of (we must watch our language) a Down's Syndrome child or a child with a cleft palate, both of which are justifiable reasons now for electing a &quot;partial-birth abortion.&quot;

<BR><DD>In fact, the law as it is now interpreted enables a mother of a normal baby to kill the child in the last trimester if the birth contributes to a mother's depression or neurotic excesses. Though it may be difficult for some to imagine that a loving adoptive mother would welcome a live baby with Down's Syndrome or a cleft palate, that option would be made available before mercicide, which is after all permanent.

<BR><DD>The advantages of this proposal are obvious and many, it seems to me, as well as of the highest importance to the body impolitic. To satisfy the squeamish who require the delicacy of euphemism, as the president seems to, we could describe mercicide as killing with kindness.

<title>Fumento: Women's Magazines Are Pink Propaganda - 12/11/96</title>

<i>December 11, 1996</i><p>
<h2>Women's Magazines Are Pink Propaganda</h2><p>     
<P>
 I don't know about you, but when I want a real scare I don't pick up a Stephen King novel
 or rent a movie like Curse of the Demon.  No, when I want a real bone-chilling I go to my
 neighborhood news stand and look at the covers of the women's and family magazines. Where
 else, I ask you, can you find such headlines plastered over the face of Kathie Lee Gifford
 or Claudia Schiffer:  "Schools That Make Kids Sick," "The Foods That Are Poisoning Your
 Child," "Are Pesticides Poisoning Our Children?" "The Woman Who Stole 5,000 Babies,"
 "Stranger Danger," "The Infidelity Epidemic," and "EPA Warning: How the Sun Can Kill Your
 Kids."
<P>
 My favorite?  Hmm . . . That would probably have to be: "Shocking Report: 
 Babysitters who Maim and Kill."  Boy, that'll keep a parent up at night, won't it?  Or at
 least keep the parent from ever going out again until the children are old enough to stay
 home alone. 
<P>
Professor John Graham of the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis did a poll in
which he found that women were far more likely to buy into the latest fad scare than were
men.  While he wasn't sure of the reason, I'll bet these magazines have something to do
with it. The Washington, D.C. watchdog groups Consumer Alert and Media Research Center
appear to agree.  Indeed, their recent study, "Women's Magazine's: A Liberal Pipeline to
Soccer Moms," found that in addition to lipstick and tampons, what these magazines
specialize in selling is fear--and the notion that Big Government is almost always the
solution. Looking at a year of offerings from 13 such magazines, with a combined
circulation of over 66 million, the organizations found most stories on science and risk
issues served no other purpose than scaring the skirts off readers--outnumberingd balanced
articles by two-to-one.
<P>
Among them:

<LI>Family Circle in last August's article, "Danger in the House," warned of a "chemical invasion" from cleaning solutions and garden pesticides.  The evidence?  Well, there's this spooky anecdote about a mother who blamed a neighbor's pesticide spraying for her daughters' stomach aches and vomiting.  That's enough for you, isn't it?  After all, mother knows best. 
<LI>McCall's and Better Homes & Gardens warned of pesticide residues in baby food.  The McCall's article warned that babies and children are more sensitive to pesticides than adults (a supposition, not a fact), but never let readers know that government sets pesticide standards to account for individuals who are 1,000 times more sensitive than average. 
<LI>Articles in Mademoiselle, Glamour, and Weight Watchers reported the alleged link between chemicals and breast cancer, without noting that the largest study ever conducted on the subject looked at two of the most often-mentioned culprits -- the insecticide DDT and the insulating liquid PCB -- and found no connections.  Weight Watchers even condemned scientific studies that pointed to such causes as genetics and diet as sexist because they "suggested it was a woman's fault if she developed breast cancer." Next thing you know, even saying the words "breast cancer" will be politically incorrect because it suggests that it's a woman's fault that she has breasts.  And what all this has to do with watching your weight I just can't figure out. 
</ul>
<P>
 Once these magazines have you
 hyperventilating into a paper bag, they then spring upon you the solution to these terrible
 problems. Yes, it's Uncle Sam, or more specifically Uncle Bill and Aunt Hillary.  The
 Consumer Alert/Media Research Center survey found 115 articles with positive portrayals of
 government activism and/or calls for more activism.  There were only 18 negative portrayals
 or calls for less government action.  Of these, 23 stories also asked readers to lobby
 government officials on behalf of expanded government programs. 
<P>
 Having made their readers
 feel bad about the way mankind is treating the environment (when you're describing
 something bad, like polluting, using "mankind" isn't sexist), they then go on to promote
 feel-good environmentalism.  Never mind that even the New York Times magazine recently did
 a cover article affirming what free-market environmentalists have been saying for over a
 decade--that most recycling is a waste of time, energy, and money.  Out of the 15 articles
 in the women's magazines on recycling, each and every one was solidly in favor of it.
 (Actually, probably the last 14 articles were simply recycled versions of the first one.)
<P>
 "Story after story," in these magazines, says Consumer Alert Executive Director Fran Smith,
 "outlines a problem and proposes that a new law be enacted and that women should lobby for
  it."
<P>
   Not for nothing did the Clinton team label its re-election campaign aimed at young
   mothers and women in general as its "Redbook strategy."  The Redbooks of the nation had
   already paved the way for his second term.

<h2>
 "Killer Airbag" Hysteria is the Real Killer
</h2>     
<p>
<dd>
 For all the news lately about the threat that airbags pose to children, you'd think it's
 the Slaughter of the Innocents all over again.  You'd believe you could look out your
 window at any time and see an airbag chasing some poor little boy or girl down the street.
 But no, such is not the case.  The scariest thing about this whole airbag thing is not the
 threat to children but that the media has taken its cue from USA Today, the paper that
 prides itself on promoting hysteria.
<p>
<dd>
 It was USA Today that led the coverage of the missing
 children epidemic in the early 1980s, telling us, "estimates of lost children [per year]
 run as high as 2 million," and asking "how could it happen?"  It also said, "More than
 100,000 children are abducted each year." How could it happen?  It couldn't and didn't. 
 The newspaper was later forced to admit that the two million figure was probably about
 30,000, of which (according to the FBI) only 67 were kidnapped.  Oops.
<p>
<dd>
 More recently, it
 was the first newspaper to inform us of an "epidemic" of  black churches being torched by
 racists.  After six months of incendiary reporting it finally admitted that of over 70
 black church burnings it looked at, only three were clearly done by racists and a third of
 the churches were burned by blacks.  Oops. No matter, there's always a new hysteria to be
 created.
<p>
<dd>
 And so it was that USA Today crack reporters in May kicked off the airbag mania
 with an article running under the inch-high headline, "DEADLY AIR BAGS."  An accompanying
 story was titled, "Why Air Bags Are Killing Children."  If your trembling hand turned to
 the next page you found "Deadly Force: Air Bags Are Claiming the Lives of Children," while
 yet another page blared, "Prescription for Safety Turns Deadly." The rest of the media then
 followed USA Today, which is about as wise as letting Stevie Wonder pilot your plane. 
 Suddenly it's worthy of a headline when a child is so much as injured by an airbag. It's
 gotten to the point where volunteers at busy freeway rest areas spent their Thanksgiving
 handing out fliers warning parents of the danger of these pneumatic beasts.  (USA Today
 proudly displayed a story on this on page one.)
<p>
<dd>
 I've always been a big seat belt fan,
 myself.  They've saved my rear (and the rest of me) twice.  But it's clear that even if you
 do wear a seat belt and especially if you don't, airbags are far more likely to save you
 than to kill you.
<p>
<dd>
 Department of Transportation (DOT) figures show that since 1987, airbags
 have probably kept 1,136 people from being crushed to death, with the life-saving rate
 accelerating rapidly as more and more cars are equipped with them.  In 1995 alone, airbags
 prevented 462 deaths. The trade-off?  Since 1990, DOT says, they have caused 52 deaths,
 including those of 32 children.  You needn't dig out that misplaced pocket calculator to
 see that this comes out to a net savings of a lot of lives. As to those 32 children, in a
 real sense that is 32 too many.  But other than being mauled by a Siberian tiger in New
 York City, there is practically nothing less likely to kill your child than an airbag. 
<p>
<dd>
 Indeed, according to the National Safety Council in Chicago, during the time those 32
 children were killed by airbags, over 15,000 children age 11 or under were killed in car
 accidents for reasons having nothing to do with the devices. But hard facts like these are
 the first casualty of panics. And so, reacting to the hysteria, DOT has decided to relax
 the law making it illegal for a mechanic to disconnect a vehicle owner's airbag.  The
 utterly unavoidable result is that people will die in crashes whose lives would otherwise
 have been saved by the devices. And for what?  As tiny as your child's risk of being killed
 or injured by an airbag currently is, you can reduce it even further by simply by sliding
 the passenger seat all the way back, and by making sure your child is wearing a seat belt. 
<p>
<dd>
 Last year, over half the children killed by airbags were not wearing seat belts.  The
 one-year-old girl who just died from an airbag was, according to the coroner, not properly
 restrained. To reduce your child's near-zero risk from airbags to absolutely zero, just put
 him or her in the back seat. Unfortunately, panicky people don't think about such things. 
 So it's off to the auto shop to have both the passenger and driver side bags disconnected.
 The first time a person is impaled on a steering wheel or squished by a dashboard because
 of a disconnected airbag, I hope we read about THAT in the papers.  But don't expect to
 hear about it from USA Today.

<title>Fumento:Bill Clinton's Domestic Abuse Cruise Missile - 9/05/96</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>
<i>  September 5, 1996</i><p>
<h2>  Bill Clinton's Domestic Abuse Cruise Missile</h2><p>     
Bill Clinton has made it clear yet again that he likes cruise 
missiles, with their ability to slip under radar screens and do damage 
without endangering the guy who launched them.  No, I'm not talking 
about Iraq, but rather Clintons' advocacy of a federal law prohibiting 
those convicted of domestic abuse misdemeanors from ever again being 
able to legally obtain a gun.  I've counted at least five things it 
accomplishes: <p>
<ul>
<li> It appeals to feminists. 

<li> It appeals to Americans' natural desire to protect women and 
children. 

<li> It promotes "gun law creep," whereby inch by inch we make fewer and 
fewer people able to legally obtain and keep guns. 

<li> It promotes "federal power creep."  See above. 

<li> It leaves the public with the impression that Clinton is a no-
nonsense "law and order" president. 
</ul>
If you're thinking that none of this has anything to do with making 
anybody safer, you're missing the point--there's an election hard upon 
us, and as Clinton taught Bush there's no such thing as a safe lead. <p>

But let's hear out Cruise Clinton. <p>

Said the president, "if you're stalking or harassing women or 
children, you shouldn't have a gun."  Can he not know that the 1994 
Violence Against Women Act which he signed already forbids the sale of 
guns to stalkers and harassers who are under court restraining orders? <p>

"The problem is there is one class of misdemeanors that tend to be 
particularly violent, where we know there's a potential for future 
violence," said Clinton.  "And that is the painful area of domestic 
violence." <p>

In fact, as Woman's Freedom Network Vice-President Cathy Young notes, 
"There is no evidence that domestic violence misdemeanor offenses are 
more violent than non-domestic misdemeanor assaults."  We'll just 
chalk that one up to presidential puffery. <p>

With domestic violence, says Clinton, "often there's a plea bargain 
which goes from a felony to a misdemeanor. " <p>

Sure, but that's true of all felonies. "Virtually all available 
research shows that when the levels of injury are the same, domestic 
assaults are no less likely than non-family assaults to be prosecuted 
as felonies," Young told me.  <p>

To the extent such plea-bargaining is a problem, it can be dealt with 
"three strikes and you're out" or other mandatory sentencing laws.  
Increasingly, states are passing just such laws.  Our purpose should 
be to try to make sure those guilty of felonies are punished with laws 
meant for felons, not to apply felony laws to persons who commit 
misdemeanors. <p>

"If you commit an act of violence against your wife or child, you 
shouldn't have a gun," thunders Clinton, who is such a fatherly type 
that he plans to adopt a child if the polls show Dole getting to 
close. <p>

But it's not that simple because the definition of "violence" can 
stretch from all the way from an unwanted grab to strangling your 
spouse and tossing the body into a meat grinder. <p>0

In most states, misdemeanor assault is any intentional touching 
without consent.  That includes such things as poking someone with 
your finger. In a New Jersey case, a man was convicted of misdemeanor 
assault not for punching his girlfriend but rather the couch she was 
sitting on.  Some states allow misdemeanor assault convictions for 
yelling at someone.  Los Angeles hero Rodney King accused his wife of 
assault because she yelled at him in the car for not being able to 
read a map.  (Rather than press charges, he promptly ran her down.) <p>

All of these are wrong, which is why the law covers them.  You can 
serve "hard time" for misdemeanor domestic violence.  But take away a 
person's right to own a gun for life because of an arm grab or heated 
words?  Slap that person in the same category as a brute who blackens 
his wife's eyes because she burned the toast?    <p>

Ironically, one outcome of this might be that many prosecutors and 
judges would feel sorry for the defendant faced with a 
disproportionate penalty, and be tempted to let him or her go scott-
free.  <p>

Conceivably Clinton's proposal could keep guns out of the hands of 
some violent people, if we make the shaky assumption that violent 
people when turned away from stores won't just go out and buy their 
guns on the street.  It's also true that we would keep guns out of the 
hands of some violent people if we forbade them for other arbitrary 
reasons, such as having blow-dryed gray hair and a bulbous nose. <p>

But the point of any law that denies somebody the right to own a gun 
should be to match as closely as possible that denial to persons most 
likely to use them for violence. There's no evidence that this is the 
case here. <p>

One figure cited in support of Clinton's proposal is that according to 
the Justice Department, of the 1.7 million incidents of domestic 
violence reported each year, 88,000 involve firearms.  That comes out 
to 5 percent of such incidents, and it doesn't mean anybody was shot 
or even that bullets were fired.  Considering that almost half of all 
Americans own guns, guns and domestic violence hardly go hand in hand. <p>

Like most gun control measures, this proposal is essentially 
irrelevent to crime control.  If you think reelecting Clinton and 
piling on more federal laws are worthy goals, you may not mind.  
Otherwise you'll see this as the harmful distraction and campaign 
stunt that it is. <p>

<title>Fumento:"Dr. Death" Takes Us Down the Slippery Slope - 8/28/96</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>
<i> August 28, 1996</i><p>
<h2>"Dr. Death" Takes Us Down the Slippery Slope</h2><p>
       


He's the sickest American cult figure since Charles Manson, with two 
major differences. First, he's killed almost eight times as many 
people. Second, he's still walking around, free to kill again. And 
kill he will. Some call him an Angel of Mercy, but he's better known 
as Dr. Death. <p>

As I write this, Dr. Jack Kevorkian has put down/put to 
sleep/euthanized persons 35, 36, 37, and 38, though lately he's been 
killing faster than I can type. None of the people appear to have been 
imminently close to death. One had Lou Gehrig's disease, the same 
illness that Dr. Steven Hawkings had for decades when he penned a 
best-selling book and became world famous. Two had multiple sclerosis, 
the disease Annette Funicello had (and has) when she starred in her 
film autobiography. <p>

The fourth, 42-year-old Judith Curren, was a nurse and a mother of two 
young children. She was overweight and depressed and believed she 
suffered from a vague (though sometimes real) malady called chronic 
fatigue syndrome (CFS). None of these are terminal, and the woman's 
belief she had CFS may well have been a manifestation of depression. <p>

Further, severe depression is often accompanied by a desire to commit 
suicide. But this is a highly treatable condition, and in any case a 
severely depressed person no more has the capacity to "elect" to die 
than a five-year-old girl can "elect" to engage in sex. <p>

But no matter, for Dr. Death continues to be treated like some gallant 
crusader. "Dr. Jack Kevorkian stepped up his campaign for doctor-
assisted suicide," began a recent Associated Press article. <p>

Wrong. Kevorkian no more kills in the name of any higher cause, 
including doctor-assisted suicide, than a lion rips out an antelope's 
throat in the name of balancing the eco-system. The lion is driven by 
instinct; Kevorkian by something we used to call evil.  <p>

The man is a ghoul. Some of us like to watch female volleyball; 
Kevorkian likes to watch people die. A much-ignored 1993 Newsweek 
article documented that in the 1950s, while studying to be a 
pathologist, Kevorkian made regular visits to terminally ill patients 
and peered deeply into their eyes. He wanted to watch the sparkle of 
life disappear. "There was no practical application," he admitted 
later. "I was curious, that's all." <p>

Later he advocated surgical experimentation on the bodies--
particularly the brains--of live death row prisoners. Later still he 
expanded his idea to encompass other persons, including "comatose, 
mentally incompetent or otherwise completely uncommunicative 
individuals . . . " <p>

Earlier this year, thinking he was making some salient point, 
Kevorkian invoked Christ's death, saying "Do you think it's dignified 
to hang from wood with nails through your hands and feet?" He said, 
"Had Christ died in my van . . . it would have been far more 
dignified." <p>

Look Jack, it's not just that a van would look rather bizarre hanging 
above the altar of my church. When Christ sacrificed his life, he knew 
he was setting himself up for crucifixion, the most painful and 
undignified mode of execution in use. Again, Kevorkian shows he is 
devoid of understanding of humanity. And it speaks volumes about the 
pro-euthanasia movement that it pretends that this man is a crusader 
for a larger cause, rather than a grown-up version of the little boy 
who pulls wings off flies.<p>

Not that some euthanasia supporters aren't just a bit queasy after 
this latest round of killings. "Sooner or later, someone will die for 
the wrong reasons," conceded a USA Today editorial, not specifying 
what the right reasons are. <p>

Others warned that if we don't watch it, we'll slide down the slippery 
slope. As if we haven't already? Jack Kevorkian IS a one-man slippery 
slope. He keeps loosening the definition of who "deserves" to die. 
Originally he saw the need to pretend that his 
clients/patients/victims were in great pain and on death's doorstep. 
But after the latest killings he admitted, "It had nothing do with 
lethality. It's quality of life . . . . Quality of life." <p>

This evolution was utterly predictable. It's called the "camel's nose" 
effect. The camel puts his nose into the tent to see if he can get 
away with it. If so, he keeps moving in until he's fully inside, hump 
and hooves. <p>

Those on both sides of the euthanasia debate in the United States are 
fully aware of the history of legal euthanasia in the Netherlands. It 
began with a doctor responding to the wishes of her terminally ill 
mother who was in much pain. Within a few decades it encompassed 
killing infants born with non-fatal diseases--Down's syndrome and 
spina bifida. Patients in persistent vegetative states, often 
incorrectly referred to as "comatose," are also now legally killable 
in Holland. <p>

According to a Dutch government survey, doctors there kill some 20,000 
patients a year, most without the patients' consent. The difference is 
that the Dutch took decades to get to that point, while Kevorkian is 
trying to bring the whole camel in within a matter of years. And 
damned if he isn't getting away with it. <p>

We need to ask ourselves right now if we want to follow Dr. Death down 
the Dutch path or if we're going to treat human life as sacred. In 
other words, we tell our doctors that they are to follow the 
Hippocratic Oath they took and "first do no harm." Executioners kill; 
doctors are supposed to heal. And "Dr. Death" is a contradiction in 
terms. <p>

<title>Fumento:The EPA vs. Clean Air - 8/22/96</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>
<i> August 22, 1996</i><p>
<h2>  The EPA vs. Clean Air</h2><p>



                    

DENVER, COLORADO  "Make a better mousetrap and the world will beat a 
path to your door," goes an old saying. Well, not always.  In some 
cases you just may find a 300-pound government gorilla obstructing the 
way. Such has been the experience of University of Denver chemistry 
professor Donald Stedman. <p>

Stedman has developed a machine which, when hidden by the side of the 
road, can detect how much exhaust a car puts out as it drives by. High 
emissions trigger a video camera which films both the car and its 
license plate.  This allows the municipality using the device to send 
a letter (perhaps backed by a fine) to the violator informing him that 
his car must be repaired. <p>

As present, the standard practice in high-pollution areas is to 
subject cars to regular inspection and maintenance programs. The 
problem is that drivers with the dirtiest cars can pass the test by 
pouring a commercial additive into their gas tank. (Since they refused 
to pay me a product placement fee, I won't tell you the name.) Or they 
can pass by tampering with the exhaust system.  <p>

Studies with remote sensors have shown that such cheating is rampant. <p>

But drivers who happen upon remote sensors have no ability to cheat. 
The effectiveness of such devices has been demonstrated repeatedly in 
the U.S. as well as in Canada and Great Britain.  Indeed, they have 
now been put into regular use in various parts of California; Phoenix; 
Ontario, and Stedman's hometown of Denver. <p>

"If we want to have any success in reducing emissions from autos, we 
must employ remote sensing technology" says Buzz Breedlove, the 
assistant director for the California Research Bureau. <p>

But the EPA, whose mission is supposed to be preserving the 
environment, doesn't like remote sensing. <p>

Why?  Breedlove told me that "the staunchest opponent of remote 
sensing" he knows once said, "The problem with remote sensing is that 
it will clean up all the cars  and we won't be able to justify a 
centralized program on a cost-effective basis." <p>

For over a decade now, the EPA has put all its eggs in one basket: the 
inspection and maintenance program. In part, this is because such 
testing requires a large centralized bureaucracy to administer it. <p>

This involves--surprise--lots of money!  The tests cost about $25 per 
car.  Remote sensing, by contrast, is about 50 cents per test. <p>

Although the EPA has improved the efficiency of its testing devices, 
they will never be truly cost efficient. "It's not a mechanical 
engineering problem," Stedman observes, "It's a human behavior 
problem. The driver's interest isn't in reducing emissions; it's in 
passing the test." <p>

Hence, if the driver thinks he'll fail and be liable for perhaps 
hundreds of dollars in repairs, he'll cheat. And the EPA's equipment 
can't stop him. <p>

But pride, reputations, and bureaucratic inertia refuse to allow the 
EPA to admit this.  And so, while remote sensors work to clean up the 
air, the EPA is working against remote sensors. <p>

First, the agency actively discriminates against state and local 
governments that want to use remote sensors. Under the Clean Air Act, 
governments are not given credit for actually cleaning up the air. 
Rather, they're given credit for running programs that the EPA says 
SHOULD BE cleaning up the air. And in its credit formula, remote 
sensing counts for very little.   <p>

Second, EPA has now cut off further funding for Stedman's lab, 
hampering his efforts to enable it to detect more types of pollutants. 
For six years he got a fairly small but, to him, vital amount of his 
research money from the EPA. No more. <p>

But hey, things are tough all over, right? Money is tight these days. 
But not for things that suit the EPA's  agenda--namely more government 
regulation. <p>

Competitive Enterprise Institute scholar Jonathan Adler has documented 
that from 1993 to 1995 alone, the radical environmental group the 
Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) received almost $2 million of 
your and my tax dollars funneled through the EPA. That's 20 times what 
Stedman's shop was receiving annually. <p>

The American Lung Association (ALA) received almost as much from the 
EPA. Unlike the NRDC, the ALA does some good work.  But part of what 
it does with all that cash is to lobby for EPA-proposed mandates.  It 
even sues the EPA to make regulations stricter.  Since by law the EPA 
can't lobby itself, it throws money at organizations who will do it 
for them.   <p>

In fact, the EPA even gives cash to a group called the Consumer 
Federation of America, which publishes literature disparaging remote 
sensing. <p>

The EPA's mandate isn't to promote bureaucratic self-interest and 
political lobbying, but to clean up the environment. Supporting remote 
sensing would do just that. <p>

<title>Fumento: Gun Control Advocates Shoot Blanks At Study - 8/15/96</title>
</head>

<i> August 15, 1996</i><p>
<h2>Gun Control Advocates Shoot Blanks At Study</h2><p>

A new report on the impact of laws allowing persons to carry concealed 
guns has gun control advocates shooting wildly and missing their 
target by a mile. <p>

The report, co-authored by law professor John Lott and economist John 
Mustard, both of the University of Chicago, concluded  "allowing 
citizens to carry concealed weapons deters violent crimes and it 
appears to produce no increase in accidental deaths.  If those states 
which did not have right-to-carry concealed gun provisions had adopted 
them in 1992, approximately 1,570 murders; 4,177 rapes; and over 
60,000 aggravated assaults would have been avoided yearly."    <p>

Think of it; that's more murders than the combined total of 21 states 
last year.  That's over 4,000 women last year alone who were violently 
sexually assaulted. <p>

In percentage terms, the authors found that when state concealed 
handgun laws went into effect in a county, murders fell by 8.5 
percent, and rapes and aggravated assaults fell by 5 and 7 percent, 
respectively.  (Thirty-one states now have such laws). <p>

Lott and Mustard, however, probably feel like they've been assaulted 
after the smearing they received in much of the press. <p>

For example, director of the Illinois Council Against Handgun Violence 
Dan Kotowski blasted the study as biased because it was funded by the 
Olin Corporation, which owns Winchester, Inc., a firearms 
manufacturer.  An <i>Associated Press</i> (AP) story and that of individual 
newspapers aired the Kotowski allegations as fact, but they were wrong 
several times over. <p>

Lott, as the John M. Olin Professor of Law and Economics at Chicago, 
is paid by the Olin FOUNDATION, which funds guest academic positions 
at institutions throughout the country.  It does not choose the 
scholars who fill these slots, but leaves it up to the institution.  
Nor does it choose their research projects.  John Olin did make money 
in firearms, but died in 1982, endowing the foundation that bears his 
name.  Since then there has been no connection between the Olin 
Corporation and the Olin Foundation. <p>

AP has now issued a retraction of the allegations.   <p>

On the other hand, Kotowski gets ALL his money from advocating handgun 
control. <p>

Meanwhile, Douglas Weil--who as research director at the Center to 
Prevent Handgun Violence also makes all his money from advocating 
handgun laws--claimed the Chicago study "goes against well-established 
evidence," citing specifically a University of Maryland report from 
last year which claimed to show that concealed weapons laws cause 
homicides to go up. <p>

Really?  The Chicago report looked at the entire nation over the last 
15 years for which data were available.  The authors of the University 
of Maryland study, conversely, picked out just five cities to report 
on out of the hundreds it could have chosen.  They didn't even use the 
same sample period for the cities, but the periods they did choose 
were just a few years each. <p>

So somehow a study that uses specially-picked cities and specially-
picked periods of time is better than one covering the whole nation 
over a decade and a half.  It makes sense to the gun control 
advocates. <p>

The nation's top law enforcement official also weighed in.  Asked 
about the Chicago report at a press conference, Attorney General Janet 
Reno avoided giving direct comment, saying she hadn't yet read it.  
But Reno, the former chief state prosecutor in Florida's Dade County, 
added her impression that Florida's concealed weapons law "didn't seem 
to be effective." <p>

Oh no?  When that law was passed in 1987, Florida had the nation's 
highest murder rate and it was going up.  Immediately it began 
dropping steadily year by year, falling almost 30 percent by 1994 and 
putting Florida under the national average in homicides.  Of over 
320,000 licenses issued between the time the law passed and the end of 
January of this year, only 58 have been revoked because the owner 
committed a crime. <p>	

So why does Miss Reno think the law wasn't effective?  Maybe it has 
something to do with the view she stated to a B'nai B'rith gathering 
in Ft. Lauderdale in 1991 that, "The most effective means of fighting 
crime in the United States is to outlaw the possession of any type of 
firearm by the civilian populace." <P>

Naturally, some gun control advocates would rather avoid the need to 
use data at all.  "It defies common sense," said Kotowski at his press 
conference, "to think that putting more guns on the streets is going 
to make us safer." <p>

Actually it makes perfect sense.  If a criminal thinks you might be 
packing something more powerful than a tiny canister of pepper spray, 
he might be just a bit more hesitant to rape, rob, or kill you.  
That's common sense, and the Chicago study simply backs it up. <p>

Common sense also suggests that if this were happening, criminals 
might compensate somewhat by committing more property crimes.  And the 
Chicago study found just that.  Criminals respond "to the threat of 
being shot" by substituting "less risky crimes," state the Chicago 
authors.  One example is burglaries in which the criminal has "cased" 
the house to make sure no one will be home. <p>

That seems a small price to pay.  I don't know about you, but I'd 
rather have my home or car broken into than be smashed over the head 
for my wallet or have my girlfriend raped.  I'll bet even most handgun 
control advocates feel the same way.   <p>

<title>Fumento:  Ignored Study Finds Pollution Program Costly and Fuelish - 8/07/96</title>

   <h2>
         Ignored Study Finds Pollution Program Costly and Fuelish</h2>
<P>
(DENVER, COLORADO) Oxygenated fuels started here in Denver and took 
the nation by storm--sort of like the Denver Boot, a nasty contraption 
they clamp onto your wheel when you don't pay your tickets.  But 
unlike the boot, which works all too well (don't ask me how I know!), 
it turns out that oxy fuels may be virtually worthless, yet cost 
motorists across the country billions of dollars. 
<P>
That's the conclusion of a recently-released report by the National 
Research Council (NRC), an arm of the National Academy of Sciences. 
The report has been utterly ignored outside of the Denver area, yet it 
concerns municipalities--and drivers--across the country. 
<P>
Oxygenated fuels, generally shortened to "oxy fuels", are made by 
putting an additive into gasoline, usually either ethanol made from 
corn or a chemical derived from natural gas called MTBE. These 
additives put more oxygen into the gasoline, and in theory make your 
car burn more cleanly. Allegedly they especially reduce the production 
of carbon monoxide, which reaches relatively high levels in many 
places during the winter. 
<P>
About 27 areas around the country are using oxy fuels during the 
winter months.  They are not provided as options, but rather forced 
into your gas tank by law.  Which is the only way local governments 
can get motorists to use them, since they not only cost as much as 
seven cents a gallon more than regular gasoline but also decrease 
mileage by at least 2-3 percent. 
<P>
As to how much this is costing the nation as a whole, bizarrely enough 
the EPA says it doesn't know.  "That should be one of the easiest 
things to identify," says Carleton Howard, an atmospheric scientist at 
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Boulder, 
Colorado. 
<P>
In any case, the Colorado Health Department says the program has cost 
the Denver area alone about $14 million a year since 1988 and critics 
say it could be twice that.  It could therefore easily be setting back 
the nation over half a billion a year. 
<P>
And for what?  We don't know, says the NRC.  Nobody knows. 
<P>
The Colorado Department of Health (CDH) instituted the oxy fuels 
program back in 1988 under pressure from lobbyists funded in great 
part by the huge grain conglomerate, Archer Daniels Midland (ADM).  
ADM is the biggest producer of the oxy-fuel additive ethanol.  It has 
also been supporting an activist who goes around saying that ethanol's 
chief rival, MTBE, makes people sick. 
<P>
  The CDH concluded the oxy-fuels program was a resounding success and 
made it permanent in Denver.  Mayor Federico Pena (now Secretary of 
Transportation) crowed about it, the Environmental Protection Agency 
crowed about it, and next thing you know, Congress was requiring it 
around the country. 
<P>
But CDH had based its approval on two findings.  First, it said that 
carbon monoxide levels in Denver's air had gone down significantly 
since the program was instituted.  Actually the city's carbon monoxide 
levels had been dropping yearly since the 1970s, primarily due to the 
installation of catalytic converters on cars.  Ah!  Details, details, 
said the CDH.  Don't bother us with details! 
<P>
Second, it put together a nice computer model that it claimed showed 
that an area-wide oxy-fuels program would reduced carbon monoxide by 
29 percent. 
<P>
But while computers don't lie, liars compute.  The NRC found that the 
most optimistic study which actually measured carbon monoxide 
reductions from oxy fuels found a 16 percent drop.  And the author of 
that study, University of Denver chemist Donald Stedman, says that 
even if everybody else had such promising results "it wouldn't be cost 
effective." 
<P>
Other studies such as one conducted by the University of Georgia found 
virtually no reduction in carbon monoxide emissions at all. 
<P>
According to one NRC panel member, University of Colorado professor 
Douglas Lawson, it does seem to be the case that at warm temperatures 
oxy fuels reduce carbon monoxide.  But carbon monoxide is only a cold-
weather problem.  "In some studies there were higher carbon monoxide 
emissions with oxy fuels at that lower temperature than with standard 
fuels," Lawson told me. 
<P>
Further, even if oxy fuels do reduce carbon monoxide, they can 
increase levels of other pollutants.  For example, benzene levels go 
up.  Benzene is strongly suspected to be a human carcinogen. 
<P>
Carbon monoxide, on the other hand, merely replaces oxygen in the 
bloodstream.  While this can be fatal in massive doses (such as when a 
faulty propane heater killed former tennis great Vitas Gerulaitis), in 
even the heaviest levels ever recorded in the air above a city it 
never causes anything more than headaches and fatigue. 
<P>
In any event, notes Lawson, "It's been known since 1983 that majority 
of emissions come from a small percentage of the cars on the road."  
<P>
Says Stedman, "Forcing all drivers to use oxy fuels for the sake of 
those few broken cars is like making everybody take aspirin every day 
for the sake of a few who will get headaches." 
<P>
As a result of the NRC findings, Colorado Governor Roy Romer--hardly 
an enemy of regulation--says he is considering dropping the oxy-fuels 
program.  Unfortunately, since this story was ignored in all the other 
parts of the country that have since adopted it, the evil that 
Colorado's regulators did will live on.

<h2>
           Paper Scares Parents for Politics and Profit
</h2>
<p>
"DEADLY AIR BAGS."  So ran the inch-high headline in USA Today.  "Why Air Bags Are Killing Children," was the title of an accompanying story.  Jump to the next page and you found "Deadly Force: Air Bags are Claiming the Lives of Children," while yet the next jump is entitled "Prescription for Safety Turns Deadly."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
There's nothing a sensationalist paper likes more than running stories about suffering children, and no paper does it better than USA Today. Back in the early 1980s it led the way in publicizing the epidemic of missing children, an epidemic that turned out to be non-existent.  Now there seems to be an epidemic of children crushed under air bags which--oh irony of ironies--are supposed to save lives.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Don't get me wrong.  I'm not the world's biggest proponent of air bags.  I AM one of the world's biggest proponents of seat belts. Twice seat belts have saved my life.  The second time was when my car went flying off a cliff and tumbled down 350 feet.  I would have had just a few scratches had my air bag not then--after the tumbling had stopped--gone off and bruised my face.  Gee, thanks a lot.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But that's the nature of the beast.  Presently air bags only protect you in head-on collisions.  And while they don't provide much additional protection beyond seat belts, they apparently do help a little, saving a little over 500 lives a year.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Unless, it seems, you're a small child.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
According to USA Today, probably 20 children will be killed by air bags this year, ten more than will have their lives saved by the devices.  Now ten children is ten children, no doubt about that.  But this year, according to the National Safety Council in Chicago, about 1,100 children between the ages of 0 to 4 will be killed in motor vehicle accidents.  An additional 2,000 will die who are between the ages of 5 and 11.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
With that many deaths, it is hard to imagine any aspect of motor vehicles less likely to kill your child than air bags.  Indeed, it is hard to imagine anything that can possibly kill your child that will kill fewer children this year than air bags.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Naturally, USA Today does everything it can to exaggerate the scope of these deaths.  Of 22 children known to have been killed by air bags since 1993, it pictures fully 12 of them.  For each and every child on which it was able to obtain records, it lists their name, age, home town, and date of death.  Their anguished parents are repeatedly quoted.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Meanwhile, the thousands of other children killed in other ways since then by car accidents go unmentioned, and even the number goes unlisted.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Yeah, yeah, but aren't I missing the big point here, that these devices that are supposed to save lives are taking them?  No, because tradeoffs with safety devices are commonplace.  Seat belts, for example, save over 5,000 American lives each year but every once in a while somebody whose life would have been saved if they had been thrown clear was instead trapped in their vehicle by a seat belt.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Air bags do save lives.  Last year, according to National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) figures, air bags saved 570 lives and took 12, including eight children.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The real point here is that while we're off  turning little bogeymen into giants, giant bogeymen are stalking the land but not getting huge spreads in USA Today or elsewhere.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
A fourth of all children in this country are now obese, setting them up for a lifetime of disease and early death.  Schools are steadily dropping physical education programs from their curricula and nobody's complaining.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Half of all black children in this country, according to Berkeley biologist Bruce Ames, are suffering broken chromosomes due to lack of folic acid in their diets.  Broken chromosomes often lead to cancer. Adding folic acid to the diet is a cinch, but parents worried about airbags and all the other media-fabricated scares of the week--from Alar to power line electromagnetic fields to pit bull attacks--don't even know this.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Of course, as few deaths as air bags cause, they could be made to cause even fewer.  Many years ago regulators such as Joan Claybrook, who was then President Carter's head of NHTSA and is now at the Naderite Center for Auto Safety, suspected that air bags posed a risk to children. Nonetheless, she pushed full speed ahead and child safety precautions were never built in.  But whose fault was that?  Why, says USA Today, Ronald Reagan's of course!
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"'If I had gone back another four years, it's entirely possible we'd have gone back and rewritten the (air bag) standard' to better account for children," USA Today quotes Claybrook as saying. "But Ronald Reagan ousted Carter," says the paper, "foreclosing Claybrook's chance to revise the standard."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"Entirely possible"?  She just needed four more years?  It's bad enough to use pictures of cute dead kids to sell papers, but turning them into political fodder--well, that's just cold.

   </i>
   
<h2>
The Great Black Church-burning Hoax
</h2>
<p>
Responding to the reported wave of southern black church burnings, 
President Clinton proclaimed that "Racial hostility is the driving 
force" behind the church burnings and said, "I want to ask every 
citizen in America to say we . . . we are not slipping back to those 
dark days." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Okay, Mr. President, I'll say it.  I'll say it because this "epidemic 
of hatred" is a fraud.  A myth.  A deliberate hoax.  There is no good 
evidence of  any increase in black church burnings. There is, however, 
evidence, that a single activist group has taken the media and the 
nation on a wild ride. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
It turns out there is no good federal data on black church arsons.  
The FBI doesn't keep such statistics, and the Department of Justice 
doesn't usually break them down by white and black churches or arson 
and accidents.  The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms only 
tracks federal fires and those it's specifically asked to investigate. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
A private group, the National Fire Protection Association, keeps 
careful track of church arsons.  While their data don't break down 
churches by race, they do show a dramatic drop in the number of church 
arsons, from 1,420 in 1980 to 520 in 1994. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Though arson committed against any house of worship is especially 
heinous, it should be reassuring to know there have been far fewer 
recently than there used to be.     
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
So who is giving out these data suggesting it's open season on black 
churches?  It turns out the main source--indeed, the one which started 
the whole thing--is far from impartial.  It is the Atlanta-based 
Center for Democratic Renewal, whose self-proclaimed mission is to 
work "with progressive activists and organizations to build a movement 
to counter right-wing rhetoric and public policy initiatives." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Originally called the National Anti-Klan Network, it changed its name 
when the Klan virtually fell apart in the 1980s.  But far from seeing 
that as a sign of declining bigotry, it has continued for more than a 
decade to issue statements and reports "discovering" a sudden 
resurgence in racist activity. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The CDR's agenda goes well beyond rooting out genuine bigotry; the 
group tars mainstream conservatives with the same brush as racist 
criminals.  The Rev. C.T. Vivian, chairman of the CDR board said,  
"There's only a slippery slope between conservative religious persons 
and those that are really doing the burning." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In late March, the CDR held a press conference and released a 
preliminary report showing a tremendous surge in black church arsons 
from 1990 to the present.  From there it's been a media snowball, with 
over 2,200 stories written on the subject to date--including three 
huge consecutive layouts in USA Today. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"You're talking about a well-organized white-supremacist movement," 
the Rev. Mac Charles Jones, a CDR board member told one paper.  "This 
is domestic terrorism," he told CNN. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But after numerous law enforcement agencies concluded there didn't 
seem to be any contact between those arsonists who had been arrested, 
others have blamed, as Jesse Jackson put it, "a cultural conspiracy."  
The "ringleaders" are everyone from talk radio hosts to Supreme Court 
Justice Clarence Thomas to the religious right. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Mary Frances Berry, chairwoman of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, 
said the Christian Coalition "created the context for the fires." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The CDR report claims there have been 90 arsons against black churches 
in nine southern states since 1990, with the number rising every year 
up to 35 in 1996 as of  June 18.  Each culprit "arrested and/or 
detained," it stresses, has been white. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But when I contacted the law enforcement officials of several states 
on the CDR list, a very different picture emerged. The CDR, it turned 
out, regularly ignored fires set by blacks and those that occurred in 
the early part of the decade, and labeled fires as arsons that were 
not--all in an apparent effort to make black church torchings appear 
to be an escalating phenomenon. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
For example CDR lists ten churches allegedly torched in Alabama, but 
State Fire Marshall John Robison says that only one of these was a 
confirmed arson.  All the others were accidental, undetermined, or 
weren't fires at all but vandalisms. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
CDR somehow managed to omit three bonafide black church arsons that 
took place in Alabama in 1994.  In two cases the culprits were black. 
Moreover, the group left out ten black church arsons that took place 
before 1994, creating the illusion that the burning of black churches 
is a recent phenomenon. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Even the claim that black churches have been singled out for arson is 
questionable.  In 1995, according to USA Today, there were 45 arsons 
against white churches and 27 against black ones in the surveyed 
states. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Other than saying that some black churches over the years have fallen 
prey to racists, we can't easily infer motives. "We have not uncovered 
in [Alabama's] 38 cases a single piece of information to substantiate 
racially-motivated fires," said Robison.  Further, "There have been no 
dramatic increases, except for this year because of the media hype."  
Other states' officials have told him the same. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Here lies the ultimate irony.  By claiming there has been an epidemic 
of black church burnings, it appears that in recent months they have 
actually caused one. They have also fomented tremendous racial 
division and caused great fear among southern black churchgoers. That 
which the Ku Klux Klan can no longer do, a group established to fight 
the Klan has done for them.

<h2>
Old Law Continues to Be a Highway Killer
</h2>


<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html">
Michael Fumento
</a>

<P>
We often hear that to live longer, most of us need to lose weight.  
But did you know that when it comes to automobiles, losing weight is a 
killer? 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
That's the conclusion of a draft National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration (NHTSA) study just evaluated by the National Academy of 
Sciences (NAS).  It found that for every 100 pounds shaved off the 
average weight of cars, 322 more Americans will die each year in 
traffic accidents. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The NAS panel declined to endorse the report, but did not specifically 
reject the 322 death figure. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
That estimate is considerably higher than the 200 deaths  a year cited 
in a 1991 NHTSA report. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
And it should make us re-evaluate an anachronistic law that's turned 
an agency with "Safety Administration" in its name into a killer. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The law is CAFE, which stands for Corporate Average Fuel Economy 
standards.  Congress enacted it in the mid-1970s as a means to 
increase the fuel economy of cars and reduce our dependence on foreign 
oil.  It mandates that the cars sold by any manufacturer selling in 
the United States must average at least 27.5 miles per gallon. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Since then, we've fought a war which made clear that nobody can tamper 
with our foreign oil supplies.  The post-war period has shown that the 
world has such a glut of oil that even with one of its major producers 
(Iraq) out the business, prices when adjusted for inflation are as low 
as they've ever been. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Yet CAFE remains on the books and it continues to kill.  Here's why. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
There are numerous ways in which auto makers have made their vehicles 
more fuel efficient.  Engines have been improved, tires have been 
stiffened so they balloon less at high speeds, car bodies have been 
made to cause less wind resistance. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But for all this, the easiest way to improve mileage is still to make 
a car lighter or to simply sell more lighter cars and fewer heavier 
ones. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
NHTSA has calculated that every 10 percent reduction car weight, on 
average, produces and 8 percent reduction in fuel consumption. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
And there's the rub.  For as car companies have sold more lighter 
cars, there have been more deaths as a result. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In what is still the best peer-reviewed work on the subject, Robert 
Crandall of the Brookings Institute and John Graham of Harvard 
calculated that CAFE had caused about 500 pounds to be cut from 
automobiles and that this 500 pound reduction was causing from 2,200 
to 3,900 fatalities per year. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
They found that each 100 pounds shaved off cost 440 to 780 lives--
somewhat above NHTSA's calculation but the point is the same.  
Lightness kills. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In defense of CAFE, NHTSA has pointed out that since it was enacted, 
automobile death rates have gone down considerably. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Sure they have, but that's because on a per-vehicle miles traveled 
basis deaths have been going down since the 1920s.  The point is they 
would have declined even further but for CAFE. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Another argument is that cars are safer than ever because of things 
like airbags and crumple zones that make the car collapse upon impact 
in such a way as to protect passengers. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
This, too, is true but irrelevant.  Were it not for CAFE those cars 
would be safer yet.     
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Indeed, one study shows that an airbag is the equivalent of about 485 
pounds.  So the airbag that you think makes you so much safer really 
just, on average, offsets CAFE. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
NHTSA contends that while cars have gotten lighter, there's no telling 
how much of this is due to CAFE  and how much to market forces.  It 
notes that many consumer items, such as cameras have been downsized by 
manufacturers without any incentive from the government. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But that comparison is "incredibly dumb," points out Sam Kazman, chief 
counsel for the Competitive Enterprise Institute in Washington, D.C.  
"Cameras are products you carry around on cords around your neck.  
There's a tremendous incentive to make them smaller and lighter.  But 
with fuel prices staying the same, there's no indication that market 
forces have made cars lighter." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Since 1988, Kazman and CEI have fought CAFE, calling it "blood for 
oil."  In 1992 they sued NHTSA over the agency's insistence that CAFE 
wasn't killing anyone.  The court found that NHTSA had used "fudged 
analysis," "statistical legerdemain," and "bureaucratic mumbo-jumbo" 
in order to avoid dealing with CAFE's safety impact. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Unfortunately, NHTSA won the next time the case returned to the court, 
because the judges said that while they were troubled by the safety 
issue, a bureaucratic agency deserves a certain amount of deference. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
And so, the deception continues.  As do the deaths. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
If all that's not enough for you, Bill Clinton and Al Gore's 1992 
book, Putting People First proposes raising CAFE standards to 40 miles 
per gallon by the year 2,000 and 45 miles per gallon by 2015.  That 
sounds more like putting people last.

<title>Fumento: Dole Right (Mostly) on Cigarette Addiction - 6/27/96</title>
</head>

<h2>            
Dole Right (Mostly) on Cigarette Addiction
</h2>


<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html">
Michael Fumento
</a>

<P>
When I heard seven tobacco company executives testify before Congress back in 1994 
that smoking wasn't addictive, I thought "These guys are lying through their nicotine-
stained teeth." The issue has resurfaced with Bob Dole's recent remarks at a Kentucky 
rally that, "To some people, smoking is addictive; to others, they can take it or leave it." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Having studied the issue since that original congressional hearing, I've found it's a lot 
more complex than most of us think. In fact, Dole's characterization seems about as 
sound as anything you'll hear on the subject. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
No matter, for Dole is a presidential candidate, and so a tempting--apparently irresistible-
-target. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"The last thing our kids need to hear is a statement from a man who would be president 
that smoking is not addictive," said Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif. "Senator Dole, side 
with our kids, not with the tobacco industry."  
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Rep. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said Dole's comments show that Joe Camel -- the cartoon 
advertisement figure -- is in the lead to be his running mate. Mother Jones magazine 
actually took a full-page advertisement out in the New York Times declaring that Joe 
Camel would be Dole's choice for Surgeon General. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Referring to the fact that tobacco companies have been among Dole's biggest campaign 
contributors, Clinton campaign spokesman Joe Lockhart said "Bob Dole should spend 
more time looking at the scientific evidence and less time counting his campaign 
contributions."  
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But you needn't be a recipient of tobacco money to think that this addiction thing is a lot 
smokier than it might seem.  True, a lot of people have had a hard time quitting 
cigarettes, but there are about as many who have managed to quit as are still smoking.  
According to the surgeon general, the vast majority of them gave up the habit without 
formal treatment. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
We live in a country in which a third of us are obese. Virtually all of them will tell you 
they've tried restricting their food intake but just can't keep it up.  Does that make food 
addictive? 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
One definition of addiction says that the substance in question must have some sort of 
intoxicating effect, and cigarettes do--albeit very slight compared to such drugs as 
cocaine and heroin.  But researchers have found the same thing about chocolate, that it 
raises levels of certain chemicals in the brain and makes you feel better. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Many of us joke about being "chocoholics" but to some who binge on thousands of 
calories of chocolate a day it's no laughing matter.  Indeed, a drug has now been found to 
block chocolate cravings. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But there is no scientific definition of addiction.  Neither the Diagnostic and Statistical 
manual of the American Psychiatric Association nor the World Organization use the term 
addiction.  This allows anybody who wants to use any definition they wish. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Thus, the famous 1964 U.S. Surgeon General's report on smoking concluded that 
smoking was not addictive, though the Surgeon General's office now says it is--a move 
some say is motivated by politics and not science. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Ultimately it comes down to how a New York Times headline put it in 1994: "Is Nicotine 
Addictive?  It Depends on Whose Criteria You Use." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But Bob Dole cleverly sidestepped the issue of whether smoking is addictive in general 
and observed that different substances have different effects on different people. You 
really can't argue with that--as much as his opportunistic opponents have tried. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
As it is, however, the issue of addiction is a red herring.  Dole was also right when he 
said, "But I think the more serious question is whether or not the FDA has jurisdiction" 
over cigarettes. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The FDA is using the addiction issue as an excuse to gain the power to regulate tobacco.  
But it routinely regulates drugs that are non-addictive--antibiotics, for instance--while 
forsaking regulation of substances that are. By the same criteria the FDA is applying to 
tobacco, "beverages containing alcohol or caffeine are addictive, but they're not regulated 
as drugs," notes Reason magazine senior editor Jacob Sullum, author of an upcoming 
book on the anti-smoking movement. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"Addictiveness is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for FDA jurisdiction," he 
says. Rather, it's just a smokescreen for Commissioner David Kessler to justify the 
sudden reversal of its longstanding position that cigarettes are not covered by the Food, 
Drug, and Cosmetic Act. "They pretend this is a new development," Sullum told me, "but 
people have been talking about the addictive potential of tobacco for hundreds of years." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Only in one respect was Dole truly wrong. He also told the Kentucky crowd, "In effect, if 
they should claim jurisdiction and find that cigarettes are a drug, then in effect, you're 
banning cigarettes and production of tobacco, so it's going to affect a lot of people." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Possibly, but probably not. Kessler and Waxman did initially say that if the FDA decided 
to regulate tobacco as a drug, a ban might be its only option. But now the FDA is instead 
pushing a series of measures ostensibly intended to reduce underage smoking, including 
restrictions on advertising, promotion, and sales. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Personally, I like some of what they propose. Society has traditionally given children less 
leeway to do stupid things than it has adults. But Dole's right in that cigarette regulation 
is best left to the states--and individuals and their parents. Federal Big Brother should--
pun intended--butt out.

<h2>
     Animal Rights Mean Human Wrongs
    </h2>


<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html">
Michael Fumento
</a>

<P>
Back when I was in college, I attended a meeting of the local animal 
rights organization.  When somebody asked the group leader about using 
animals for medical research she replied (and I'm not making this up) 
"Well, it's our belief that people shouldn't get sick, in which case 
there would be no need for animal testing." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Such awesome smugness is actually par for the course for these people.  
Consider the following statements from Ingrid Newkirk, co-founder and 
vice-president of People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), the 
largest animal rights organization.  
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"A rat is a pig is a dog is a boy." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Medical research is "immoral even if it's essential." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Even if animal testing produced a cure for AIDS, "We'd be against it."  
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
And here's the kicker:   "Six million people died in concentration 
camps," she told the Washington Post, "but six billion broiler 
chickens will die this year in slaughter houses." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Somehow I have trouble identifying that chicken breast I ate last 
night with my cousins who died in German camps.  And I must say that 
"Heil Frank Perdue!" seems to lack an ominous ring. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But then, I am a member of the group that constitutes the lowest form 
of animal life.  No, not lawyers--humans. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
This week, the animal rights groups are going on the warpath against 
us human types.  They're launching "World Animal Awareness Week," 
beginning June 18th, in Washington, D.C. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Fortunately, the medical community has decided it's mad as hell and 
isn't going to take it anymore. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
They pre-empted Wacky Week by launching their own campaign.  It 
included a press conference, statements by scientists and patients 
affected by animal rights extremism, release of a joint consensus 
letter signed by the nation's leading AIDS organizations supporting 
animal testing, and a report called Endangered Cures, which details 
specific areas of research threatened by animal rights activists. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Animal rights activists aren't called that for nothing.  They don't 
just stand around on street corners politely handing out pamphlets.  
Indeed, they have struck at scores of labs across the country and in 
other nations, smashing equipment and releasing experimental animals--
sometimes killing them in the process. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Among the raids the animal liberators have conducted was one on the 
laboratory of Dr. John Orem, who was using cats in painless research 
on crib death.  Crib death will claim 8,000 babies lives this year. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Everyone who works with experimental animals lives in constant fear of 
harassment, vandalism, and death threats.  Said PETA's medical 
advisor, Dr. Neal Barnard, a few years ago, "We're demoralizing the 
people who think there's a buck to be made in animal research.  And 
they're starting to get scared . . . and they're starting to veer 
away." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But the activists are also waging a war of public opinion with 
misleading ad campaigns, staged photos of animals in pain, and by 
enlisting the support of many celebrities like Paul McCartney, the B-
52s, Kim Basinger, Mary Tyler Moore, Woody Harrelson, and Alec 
Baldwin--the last of whom was later spotted wearing a leather jacket.  
Oops. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"The worst aspect of these campaigns, says Frankie Trull, president of 
the Foundation for Biomedical Research.  "Is the way they have shaped 
public opinion by providing misinformation and playing upon emotions 
of people who love pets." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
This is ironic, because if the activists get their way, keeping a pet 
will be outlawed as slavery.  Pet ownership is an "absolutely abysmal 
situation brought about by human manipulation," Newkirk told the 
Washingtonian magazine. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But such views are kept out of the slick adds.  As a result, "They're 
eroding public support that would allow this research to continue," 
Trull told me. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The stakes couldn't be higher.  Animal testing of drugs intended for 
humans is absolutely vital.  Indeed, it's required by law. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"All drugs approved by FDA in last 30 years have to be tested on 
animals," says Wise Young, a professor of neurosurgery at New York 
University Medical Center and medical advisor to actor Christopher 
Reeve. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Without animal testing, he told me, we wouldn't have gotten anti-
hypertension drugs, anti-diabetic drugs, pharmaceuticals for epilepsy, 
or any of the modern anti-depressants.  "It's horrendous the kinds of 
lives people have when they don't have the benefits of research." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
He noted that one drug originally tested on spinal cord injuries in 
humans failed.  But later it was tried in much higher doses in 
animals. There it was found effective and the trials were successfully 
repeated in humans.  This drug was given to Reeve and reduced his 
paralysis to the point where he has been able to resume much of his 
life. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Ultimately, the animal rights activists are simply parasites.  They 
benefit just as much from animal-assisted medical research as anyone, 
even while they vigorously oppose it.  Oh sure, they abstain from 
eating hamburgers or wearing raccoon coats. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
On the other hand, they could wear bracelets with tags (similar to 
those worn by persons with penicillin allergies), saying "In case of 
emergency, do not administer any drugs or therapies tested on 
animals." Bet you don't see that any time soon.

               Bill Clinton Again Betrays the Vets

<P>

Wanted for pandering: President William J. Clinton. No, not 
philandering, pandering.  The latest incident: doling out money to 
veterans allegedly suffering from the effects of the herbicide Agent 
Orange, in order to shore up his political support among a group that 
has understandably come to loathe him.  
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Clinton had a PR problem with the military even before he became 
president.  When almost three million of America's sons and daughters 
served their country in Vietnam, he was dodging the draft and figuring 
out a way to smoke marijuana without inhaling.  As president, he had 
barely taken the oath of office when he ordered that homosexuals be 
openly allowed in the military. And now, the greatest insult, his 
lawyer has declared him an active duty serviceman in order to postpone 
Paula Jones's suit against him. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
So with the election just five months off and his opponent a true war 
hero, Clinton decided to open the government coffers to a number of 
Vietnam vets by providing compensation for those who have suffered 
from a rare nerve disease called peripheral neuropathy, who contract 
prostate cancer, or have babies born with spina bifida. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The Veterans' Administration has estimated the five-year cost of this 
largesse at $350 million, which of course is too low because early 
estimates always are.  In any case, because prostate cancer is the 
most common malignant tumor in men (about one in ten will eventually 
contract it) and because Vietnam vets are only now starting to reach 
the age where it becomes a major threat, the cost of this giveaway 
will surely reach many billions of dollars. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
This might be fair if there were scientific evidence that these 
problems were really being caused by Agent Orange.  But there is not. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Those who were exposed to the very highest levels--the men of 
"Operation Ranchhand" who actually sprayed it--have been intensely 
studied for years. They have shown no more cancers, and their children 
no more birth defects, people with no dioxin or Agent Orange exposure. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Thus, one of the Ranchhand researchers told a House committee in 
April, "The accumulated evidence does not establish that there is a 
cause-and-effect relationship between herbicide exposure and spina 
bifida." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
So where does President Clinton get off on saying there IS a 
connection? 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
His support comes from an Institute of Medicine (IOM) report, which is 
an update of an earlier report previously used to grant compensation 
to veterans suffering other diseases such as Hodgkin's disease, non-
Hodgkins lymphoma, and certain respiratory cancers. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
IOM is an arm of the non-governmental National Academy of Sciences.  
Congress asked the group to look into Agent Orange after Congress's 
own Office of Technology Assessment repeatedly found that very few 
ground troops were ever exposed to the herbicide and that no vets or 
their offspring had been shown to suffer health effects from it. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Both IOM studies used methodology that was anything but scientific.  
They largely ignored the volumes of data that showed no link between 
Agent Orange and health effects--the Ranchhander findings--and instead 
looked at studies of  Swedish and Dutch herbicide applicators, and the 
like. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"Any study of anybody anywhere in the world with exposure to 
herbicides was used by IOM," explains Michael Gough, director of 
science and risk studies at the Cato Institute, a former chairman of 
the Ranchhand Advisory Committee, and author of the book Dioxin, Agent 
Orange. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
One problem: None of these people were exposed to Agent Orange, but 
rather to other types of herbicides, many of which didn't even contain 
dioxin. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Moreover, the studies themselves consistently contradicted each other.  
One might find an excess of lung cancer but not of Hodgkin's disease.  
Another would find an excess of Hodgkin's disease but not of lung 
cancer. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Ignoring such inconvenient facts, the IOM--well aware that it was 
working under political parameters and not scientific ones--seized on 
the slightest excuses to indict the herbicides even when the evidence 
weighed heavily on the other side. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
For example, their 1993 report listed 28 studies which looked for 
prostate cancer among persons exposed to herbicide.  Of these, three 
were positive (that is, they found a statistically significant 
increase), one was significantly negative, and 24 didn't go either 
way.  Bingo!  Herbicides cause prostate cancer.  Agent Orange is an 
herbicide.  Ergo, Agent Orange causes prostate cancer! 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"It's unbelievably bad what the IOM did," says Gough. "I think one of 
the major costs of something like this is that all the scientists, 
government and nongovernment, who have done their best to understand 
and explain the health of veterans are now discredited." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Thus, he says, it also bodes ill for getting the truth out on Gulf War 
Syndrome, another alleged disease phenomenon that has more to do with 
politics than science. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Ultimately, it is the vets themselves who will lose the most. Yes, 
some will get money, if they contract the right diseases. But at the 
same time, they're being needlessly terrified. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
How many vets will now refuse to have babies because they're afraid 
they will be born with birth defects?  How many will spend the next 
few decades agonizing that because of their Vietnam service they are 
far more likely to contract prostate cancer, a terrible illness to get 
even if you survive it?   
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Once again, Clinton has shown himself the enemy of the military.  And 
it's when he's making a show of being compassionate that he does the 
most damage.

<h2>Men & Abortion</h2><p>
<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/howley.html">
<b><i>Kathleen Howley</i></b></a><br> 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
I am going to try to say this without sounding like a man-hating 
feminist. Here goes. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There are few things in life more disgusting than men who, when 
discussing abortion, use the phrase: "I can't tell a woman what to do 
with her body." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It's like a password. It's usually pronounced with a self-satisfied 
smile. They're saying, "I'm cool. I'm a supportive kinda guy. I'm 
sensitive to the needs of women." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Yea, right.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Sometimes, there's a slight reluctance in their voice as they recite 
the mantra. Those are the ones who believe that while they, 
personally, are opposed to abortion, they couldn't tell a 
woman...blah, blah, blah. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
You've heard it before, I'm sure. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In most cases, these guys have never, in their lives, used the words 
"chaste" and "dating" in the same sentence. You can bet that many of 
them are pretty adroit at telling a woman what to do with her body, if 
it happens to serve their own needs. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Abortion, or "choice," as it's euphemistically called, becomes a 
requirement, for many of them, because it has the ability to erase any 
unforeseen problems caused by their lack of moral discretion. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
I was at a G.O.P. cocktail party last week, and a man used that old 
line on me: "I can't tell a woman what to do with her body."  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
I gave him the logical response: "What about the body inside her womb? 
What if it's a male body, a little boy? Surely that can't be her body, 
because she can't be a man and a woman at the same time. Can you tell 
her, in that case?" 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
He looked at me glumly. This was not the response he expected. He 
probably assumed, because I'm a young woman, that I'm pro-choice.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Not a wise move. Three major studies within the last four years show 
that women tend to be more pro-life than men.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Makes sense, doesn't it? We're the ones with the maternal instincts, 
and if we know the facts of life -- meaning all the stuff you never 
read in the newspaper, such as what an abortion does to an unborn 
child -- many of us come down on the side of the baby. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
I've been around enough men to know that they occasionally daydream 
about great feats they would perform if, for example, they suddenly 
found themselves trapped, with their whole platoon, under enemy fire. 
It's one of the most charming qualities of men, this desire to prove 
themselves to be brave and fearless. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But, so many men fail to realize that all around them, in our modern 
world, are opportunities to show their valor. Every day, they are 
confronted with opportunities to witness to the truth -- situations 
which, perhaps, take more courage than saving a platoon from enemy 
attack. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Once a month, I attend a rosary vigil with about 200 people in front 
of a local Planned Parenthood clinic. I see the woman going in for 
abortions, some reluctantly, some being steered through the door by a 
man who is probably the father of the baby.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
After about 45 minutes, some of the men come out, alone, looking 
relieved. They did their duty and sat in the waiting room with their 
significant other until it was time for the abortion, and then they 
get to go off -- get a cup of coffee, read the paper -- while she's in 
the recovery room.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What bothers me is that most of these guys are dressed as if they were 
on a date -- as if they were on the way to the movies. Except, this 
date involves the destruction of their children, and the wounding of 
their girlfriends. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
I'm with the early feminists, when it comes to abortion. Elizabeth 
Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, Dr. Alice Bunker Stockham, and the 
whole crowd of them were staunchly pro-life. They called abortion 
"child murder," and the "exploitation of women and children." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
More emphatically, they pointed out that abortion primarily serves the 
needs of the predatory male. In a July, 1869, article in "The 
Revolution," the feminist newspaper edited by Elizabeth Cady Stanton 
and Susan B. Anthony, the latter -- of current U.S. one-dollar coin 
fame-- wrote: 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Guilty? Yes, no matter what the motive, love of ease, or a desire to 
save from suffering the unborn innocent, the woman is awfully guilty 
who commits the deed. It will burden her conscience in life, it will 
burden her soul in death; but oh! thrice guilty is he who, for selfish 
gratification, heedless of her prayers, indifferent to her fate, drove 
her to the desperation which impels her to the crime." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In her day, Susan B. Anthony was describing a tiny minority of men. 
Today, you'll run into hordes of them at just about any political 
cocktail party you attend. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But, still, there are countless other men who dare to swim against the 
tide -- men who respect life, and respect women, at a time when 
neither is required by the world. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Those are men who don't have to daydream about performing feats of 
great valor. They do it every day.

<b><i>Kathleen Howley</i></b></a><hr><br></center>  



When the local Catholic priest trades his black suit and Roman collar 
for faded jeans and a T-shirt, and says to his flock, "Just call me 
Bob," what should you do? 
<P>
I suppose intercessory prayer should be your first response, but after 
that, you might think of picking up "Serpent On the Rock," a 1994 book 
by Alice Thomas Ellis, a native of Liverpool. 
<P>
It's a funny, faithful, and realistic view of what it means to be 
Catholic in the 1990s.  <P>

P.D. James, best-selling author of British murder mysteries, reviewed 
the book for the Times Literary Supplement, and described it as: "One 
woman's idiosyncratic, passionate and sometimes intemperate 
view...(It) should be compulsory reading for all bishops and placed in 
the library of all seminaries and theological colleges." <P>

But, most importantly, it will make you laugh. In fact, it's quite 
possible that while reading the book you will, on occasion, be 
convulsed by fits of uncontrollable laughter. I was. 
<P>
Ellis, the mother of seven children, traveled across Ireland and 
England, asking people what they thought about the current state of 
the Catholic Church.  <P>

 Ecumenism, liberation theology, liturgy, and feminism -- it's all 
there. <P>

She gives plenty of ink to Catholics who dissent from Church 
teachings. Then, she politely puts in a word or two of her own. 
<P>
She writes: "Visiting some people I had not seen for years I found 
again that smiling determination to deny that there is anything awry 
in the Church -- despite the fact that the Vatican and many 
theologians are seldom in accord and that there is laxity, confusion 
and an abundance of what used to be called heresy until it was decided 
that this was rude and everyone was entitled to his own opinion." 
<P>
Ellis, on church architecture: <P>

"If you visited a place where you knew the Catholic church had been 
recently constructed, you only had to ask for the most diabolically 
ugly building in town, bar none." 
<P>
On the interior decoration of churches: 
<P>
"It doesn't feel too different from McDonald's or the bank, and the 
local post office has got a new carpet, too. If I merely want to feel 
comfortable I go to the pub." 
<P>
On Confession: <P>
   "The church noticeboard advertised a 'Ceremony of Reconciliation' 
with the word 'Confession' in brackets. One day, bowed down under an 
awareness of my failings, I went to unburden my soul. Having conducted 
an examination of conscience I announced 'sub rosa' that, on 
reflection, I had to accuse myself of having fallen short in virtually 
every aspect of what was required of me: I was, to say the least, 
inadequate as a daughter, wife, mother and Catholic. Picture my 
astonishment on hearing my confessor suggest soothingly that he feared 
I was suffering from 'low self-esteem.'" 
<P>
On women priests:  
<P>
"I find something infinitely touching in the sight of males serving at 
the altar. A seriousness, a dignity and a humility which are not 
readily apparent in most of the other things they do. Women don't give 
the same impression. I saw some round the altar in New Zealand. They 
looked incongruous and bossy, very much as though they felt only they 
knew how to wash up properly." 
<P>
On sex: 
<P>
"I keep meeting women who insist on telling me how important their sex 
drive is to them. Once they might have announced they were regular 
church-goers; now they tell you they're sexually active. It's a sort 
of claim to credibility." 
<P>
On homosexuality: 
<P>
"Nor do I understand why so many people seem determined to define 
themselves by their sexual orientation. It seems unnecessarily 
limiting. When a person fixes you with a glance and says 'I'm 
gay/lesbian, you know,' you think: 'So what, darling? Just don't eat 
with your mouth open.'" 
<P>
On nuns:  
<P>
"One sometimes hears of women who are said to have been 'hurt' by the 
Church. I was thinking now of a new-style 'nun' who, finding herself 
at dinner sitting between two Jesuits, burst into tears because they 
spoke only to each other. She felt ignored and therefore diminished -- 
and fled, weeping. As a married women I am entirely accustomed to this 
kind of experience and do not mind it in the least. It gives you time 
to think your own thoughts, which are often more diverting than the 
conversations of men. Perhaps she would have felt more at ease in an 
old-fashioned convent where she would not have had to cope with the 
complexities of social intercourse between the sexes." 
<P>
Unfortunately, you might have a problem getting your hands on a copy 
of "Serpent on the Rock," published by Hodder and Stoughton, a British 
firm. So far, the book hasn't been distributed in America. 
<P>
Your local bookstore may be able to special-order it. If you have 
friends or relatives in Ireland or England, you could ask them, or 
even beg them, to send you a copy. Or, write directly to the publisher 
at: 338 Euston Rd., London NW1 3BH. 
<P>
It's worth the effort. If you're not one of the lucky Catholics in 
America who lives in a parish with a licit and reverential Mass, then 
you're probably long overdue for a dose of laughter, the best 
medicine.

<html><head><title>Howley: Divorce, Irish Style</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg"><center><i>
 November 28, 1995</I><hr><h2>Divorce, Irish Style</h2><br><a href="/townhall/columnists/howley.html"><b><i>Kathleen Howley</i></b></a><hr><br></center>  

Centuries of oppression couldn't stamp out the Catholic Church in 
Ireland. The deadlier the persecutions became, the more people clung 
to the Rock of Peter. 
<p>
A tragic famine that killed one out of every eight people in Ireland 
didn't shake their faith. Only a tiny fraction became "soupers," the 
name given to people who denied the faith in order to receive food 
from Protestant soup kitchens. 
<p>
Nor could dismal poverty, lasting for generations, make Irish people 
lose their hope in winning eternal life through fidelity to the 
teachings of the Church.  
<p>
But, a decade or two of secularization and materialism has managed to 
cripple the faith in Ireland quite easily, with hardly a voice raised 
in complaint. 
<p>
For proof of that, just look at their politics. 
<p>
In 1990, Ireland elected a left-wing, pro-choice lawyer, Mary 
Robinson, as president. In 1993, the government removed legal 
sanctions against homosexual activity, and made condoms freely 
available. 
<p>
And now, in a country that is more than 92 percent Catholic, divorce 
has been legalized -- albeit by a wafer-thin margin. 
<p>
In fact, the recent divorce referendum proved to be the closest vote 
in Irish history. A recount confirmed that only 9,114 "yes" votes 
provided the margin of victory for 1.6 million ballots cast. 
<p>
The Irish press lent a helping hand in defeating the pro-family 
forces, just as our own American press does for family issues on our 
side of the ocean. 
<p>
For example, Irish articles tended to describe those who opposed the 
legalization of divorce as blindly following the heavy-handed 
teachings of the oppressive Catholic Church. 
<p>
On the other hand, pro-divorce voters were not portrayed as mindlessly 
following the dictates of the liberal agenda -- like liberal Democrats 
in America, who all claim to be free-thinkers, yet, march lockstep on 
every issue.  
<p>
No -- articles tended to give the impression that supporting divorce 
qualified someone as being thoughtful and farseeing. 
<p>
And, the press employed their usual "reductio ad extremus" technique, 
giving big play to stories that profiled heartbreaking cases, to 
emphasize the tragic results of opposing liberal advances.  
<p>
Such as: the story of a young woman, abused and deserted by her 
husband, consigned to a life alone. In reality, that situation 
represents only a tiny fraction of the marriages in Ireland. 
<p>
Someday, the Irish will learn what many Americans have gleaned from 
watching the disintegration of our own society: Tough cases make bad 
laws. 
<p>
As it turned out, there were several deciding factors in the campaign 
to legalize divorce. The biggest was the $800,000 chunk of public 
money used by the government to fund a pro-divorce publicity drive. 
Shortly before the big vote, an Irish court ruled it was illegal to 
use tax revenues in that way. But, by then it was too late. Most of it 
was already spent. 
<p>
And, the pro-divorce movement was helped with cameo appearances by a 
host of Irish celebrities, such as Bono of U2, and Van Morrison. 
<p>
Another factor was the weakness of the Catholic Church, depleted by an 
endless array of sex sandals that began several years ago when the 
much-beloved bishop of Galway, Eamonn Casey, resigned after admitting 
he had fathered a child with an American woman. 
<p>
In the days before the vote, posters appeared on lampposts all over 
Dublin picturing Bishop Casey. The text stated: "Let the Bishops look 
after their own families ... VOTE YES." 
<p>
Fifteen years ago, no prominent Irish politician would have dared to 
support divorce. To do so would have meant mean electoral suicide. 
Yet, in the recent divorce campaign, every major party was pro-
divorce. 
<p>
What could have caused such a change in Irish society? The biggest 
impetus, many agree, has been the endless stream of soul-less 
television shows beamed into Irish homes over the last decade, most of 
it American-made. 
<p>
Last June, I was in Ireland, visiting my family. One afternoon, I 
stopped at a friend's farmhouse for tea, and while we chatted, she 
kept the television on in the background to entertain her four-year-
old daughter. 
<p>
Children in Ireland watch television just like American kids: soaking 
everything in with big eyes. 
<p>
It was an episode of "Murphy Brown" that portrayed Murphy and her 
lover having a tryst in a hotel room.  
<p>
My friend didn't mind that her daughter was exposed to such 
immorality. But, it was a shock to me, even though I was weaned on 
that kind of trash. 
<p>
What was once inconceivable in Ireland had become old hat. 
<p>
In times past, the Irish believed that marriages, even unhappy ones, 
lasted forever. They believed that adultery was a poison to a society. 
And, their laws reflected their beliefs.  
<p>
Today, they have set their sights on the liberal path that Americans 
blazed more than 20 years ago.  
<p>
It leads, as we know first-hand, to a place where broken families, 
violence and endless heartache are commonplace. 
<p>
Remember that lonely young woman, abused and abandoned by her husband? 
Currently, she represents just a handful of Irish women. But, you can 
bet that in a few decades, that sort of misery will be spread all over 
Ireland.

<html><head><title>Howley:  Pagans I Have Known</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg"><center><i>
 November 16, 1995</I><hr><h2>Pagans I Have Known</h2><br><a href="/townhall/columnists/howley.html"><b><i>Kathleen Howley</i></b></a><hr><br></center>  
 
The press pretty much ignored the 20th annual Women's Ordination 
Conference, held during the Veteran's Day weekend at a Marriott hotel 
near Washington D.C. 
<p>
Apparently, it's not newsworthy when 1,000 Catholic women -- more than 
half of them nuns from mainstream orders -- gather to denounce the 
teachings of their church, ridicule the pope, and voice avid support 
for lesbianism and abortion.  
<p>
Ho hum. Tell me something new. 
<p>
But, if the reporters and their cameras had been there, I'd be willing 
to bet that they wouldn't have focused on the over-the-edge, bizarre 
events of the conference, such as the Friday night opening ritual that 
included women dressed as bishops and priests, dancing on-stage to a 
rhythmic, sensual drum beat.  
<p>
Instead, they probably would have zoomed in on the mere handful of 
moments that corresponded with their idea of what these women are 
interested in: ordination and inclusive language. 
<p>
But, anyone who has spent five minutes around W.O.C. members knows 
better. Do you really think these women want to kneel at the feet of a 
"patriarchal" bishop to receive the Sacrament of Holy Orders?  
<p>
No way. First, they don't believe in Sacraments, as instituted by 
Christ and defined by the Catholic Church. For example, I've heard 
their leaders suggest, repeatedly, that several new Sacraments should 
be added to mark the stages of women's lives, such as the onset of 
wisdom, which supposedly happens when a woman reaches 50 -- they call 
it "croning." 
<p>
The "Sacrament of Croning." See what I mean?  
<p>
Secondly, they are adamant about their desire to dismantle the 
priesthood as we know it, and change the function of a priest into a 
non-sacramental facilitator who derives power from the community. 
<p>
 "Ordination means sub-ordination," was the mantra at the recent 
conference. They claim they want to "deconstruct" the priesthood. 
Meaning, they want to destroy it. 
<p>
And, inclusive language? They're definitely not interested in that. 
They demand that liturgical language be exclusively feminine. 
<p>
I've been to plenty of W.O.C. and Women-Church gatherings. The events 
always include prayers to the goddess, who, for the uninitiated, has 
three personalities -- maiden, mother, and crone -- each with various 
names. 
<p>
And, the conferences usually include bread-breaking rituals that 
resemble a Catholic Mass. 
<p>
At most of their rituals, the focal point is an altar with a statue of 
the goddess, usually with a candle burning in front of it.  
<p>
During the Saturday night "ritual meal" at the recent conference, 
there was no statue in sight, but the goddess personality of the 
moment was the ever-popular Sophia, a W.O.C. invention that twists the 
Scriptural meaning of "Sophia" -- recognized by Catholics as the 
virtue of wisdom, or as another name for the Holy Spirit -- and turns 
it into a pagan deity. 
<p>
That night, in the darkened banquet hall, one of the incantations 
sounded eerily like the Divine Praises: 
<p>
"Blessed be Sophia. Blessed be her holy name. Blessed be all women: 
young, generative and wise. Blessed be Sophia's sisters who keep alive 
the discipleship of equals. Blessed be all children who tell the 
stories of their foremothers...."  
<p>
It was chanted by all the attendees, following a bread-breaking 
ceremony. The only ones who didn't take part were a handful of 
faithful Catholics who were there as observers. 
<p>
Hours later, after the ritual meal was finished, and the attendees had 
moved on to another room for an all-women dance with cash bar, I spoke 
to one of the waitresses, who was clearing tables. 
<p>
"What did you think?" I asked her. 
<p>
"I'm a born-again Christian," she warily told me, in broken English, 
"so I really don't know about these Catholic things." 
<p>
"This was definitely not Catholic. It was pagan," I said, 
emphatically. 
<p>
She looked relieved to find out that I wasn't one of "them," and 
confided, in a low voice, "I felt the presence of evil here, tonight." 
<p>
"Me, too," I told her. 
<p>
Beyond the fact that every soul is precious in the eyes of the Father, 
why should the apostasy of W.O.C. followers interest us in the least? 
<p>
Because these are powerful women. They teach at Catholic universities 
and seminaries. They run Catholic high schools. They work in 
chancelleries and parishes. They design R.C.I.A. and C.C.D. programs. 
They run retreats and offer spiritual direction to unsuspecting 
Catholics. 
<p>
They don't want to leave the Church. They want to remake it, in their 
own image. 
<p>
And, it's rare to find one who doesn't have a string of graduate 
degrees after her name. The elderly members of their religious orders 
may live in fear of losing their health insurance as a result of a 
shrinking financial base, but these younger members, typically 50 to 
65 years old, have plenty of money to continue their education. 
<p>
In the battle for the soul of the Roman Catholic Church in America, 
these women are mighty adversaries, indeed.<p><p> <I>Copyright 1995, <a href="mailto:73360.271@compuserve.com">Kathleen Howley</a></i><P> <br><center><a href="/townhall/tbut.map"><img src="/townhall/tbut.gif" ismap border="0"></a></center></body></html>

<title>Howley:  The Catholic Church(es) in China</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">

<hr>
<h2>The Catholic Church(es) in China</h2><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/howley.html"><b><i>Kathleen Howley</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
 
 
Americans are in the dark when it comes to the Catholic Church in 
China -- or, I should say, the two Churches in China: one, the 
underground Roman Catholic Church, the other, the Communist-controlled 
Patriotic Catholic Church. 
<p>
To illustrate the degree of confusion, Joseph Kung, the nephew of 
Ignatius Cardinal Kung, the much-beloved bishop of Shanghai, tells the 
following story: 
<p>
He was at a pro-life dinner last year in New Jersey. A monsignor 
tapped him on the shoulder, introduced himself, and said: "I just saw 
your uncle. He gave a speech at the seminary this morning." 
<p>
Joseph Kung knew his uncle had not been at the seminary that day, and 
immediately realized that the monsignor was talking about the OTHER 
bishop of Shanghai -- Aloysius Jin Luxian, S.J., appointed by the 
Communists and consecrated without the Holy Father's permission. 
<p>
After Kung explained the situation, the monsignor replied: "I had no 
idea. I thought I was listening to the Roman Catholic bishop of 
Shanghai. And, so did all the other people at the lecture." 
<p>
Generous Catholics in America have donated millions of dollars to aid 
the Catholic Church in China. Few realize that their money is helping 
to support the Patriotic Church. 
<p>
Still, the real Catholic Church in China is alive and growing 
stronger, despite the fact that it is persecuted, penniless, and, it 
would seem, friendless. 
<p>
Chinese Roman Catholics celebrate their Masses in hiding, or, during 
bolder moments, in open fields. They risk life and limb to protect 
their underground priests and seminarians. Their families pray the 
Rosary in secret.  
<p>
Life would be easy if they would just align themselves with the 
Patriotic Catholic Church. But, they won't. 
<p>
They follow the example of their shepherds, the loyal bishops who have 
refused to renounce the fullness of the faith, despite imprisonment 
and torture. Three years ago, one elderly bishop, Joseph Fan Xueyan, 
S.J., was beaten to death by his jailers. The rest of the world hardly 
noticed. But, his flock did. 
<p>
On the other hand, the Patriotic Church controls the real estate, the 
churches, and has approval from the Communist government and numerous 
Catholic bishops in the free world. Often, their seminarians study in 
America, supported by American dioceses. 
<p>
Bishops and priests of the Patriotic Church describe themselves as 
loyal members of the Catholic Church. Or, if they are willing to admit 
to their true status, they'll rationalize that the pope is "making 
overtures" to the Patriotic Church.  
<p>
The Holy Father has a certain brand of patience and tact that he uses 
when dealing with Communists -- a method he learned first-hand during 
his years in Poland. It's not to be confused with approval. 
<p>
In fact, John Paul II made his feelings clear when he made the true 
and loyal bishop of Shanghai -- Ignatius Kung -- a Prince of the 
Church. 
<p>
"With what prayerful longing and love do I follow the life of the 
loyal Chinese Catholic communities," the pope said, when he received 
Cardinal Kung in 1991. 
<p>
True -- the Patriotic bishops say they love the Holy Father, and 
respect him as the Successor of Peter. But, they don't believe that he 
has the authority to appoint bishops or to govern the Catholics in 
China. 
<p>
Cardinal Kung, now 94 and living in Connecticut, spent 30 years in a 
Communist prison. If he had been willing to renounce the authority of 
the pope, he would have been released and rewarded with a high 
position in the Patriotic Church. Others did -- like Bishop Jin of 
Shanghai, Bishop Fu Tieshan of Beijing, and Bishop Zong Huaide, the 
president of the Patriotic Association. But, Cardinal Kung would not. 
<p>
Today, the Communists continue to arrest members of the underground 
Church. Sadly, the state-connected Patriotic Church has yet to 
denounce the persecutions. 
<p>
The ranks of the loyal bishops arrested within the last few weeks 
include the 76-year-old Bishop Zeng Jingmu -- his second arrest since 
August -- as well as Bishop Han Dingxiang and Bishop Jia Zhiguo. All 
were later released, but the message was clear: don't give us trouble, 
or you'll be arrested again. 
<p>
Several underground priests, including a Jesuit, are currently serving 
prison terms. One was recently released, after being severely 
tortured. 
<p>
And, lay people have been imprisoned for attending an underground 
Mass. This past Easter, dozens were arrested and tortured. 
<p>
For an update on recent arrests, or for information on how to help the 
underground Catholic Church in China, contact the Cardinal Kung 
Foundation, P.O. Box 8086, Ridgeway Center, Stamford CT 06905. 
<p>
 With all its advantages, it would be reasonable to assume that the 
Patriotic Catholic Church has the most followers, wouldn't it? But, it 
doesn't work out that way. 
<p>
There are three million members of the Patriotic Church. Compared that 
to NINE million members of the underground Roman Catholic Church -- an 
increase of 300 percent since the beginning of the persecution in 
1949. 
<p>
Best of all, the true bishops of China continue to proclaim Church 
teachings joyfully, loudly and completely -- even though they know the 
only way to ensure their own safety is to stay silent. 
<p>
Sixty years ago, Catholic school children in America donated "pennies 
for China" to support the missions. 
<p>
Today, we have reaped a priceless reward for that almsgiving: an 
example of courage and faithfulness that could -- if it were more 
widely known -- be an inspiration for others to remain steadfast in 
the ancient Faith.

<title>Old TV Makes A Comeback</title>

<h2>Old TV Makes A Comeback</h2><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/howley.html"><b><i>Kathleen Howley</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
 
I stopped watching mainstream television shows almost two years ago. I 
finally cracked.  <p>

One of the last straws was an episode of "Seinfeld" -- a well-written 
series that was relatively clean in its first year, but gradually 
ended up in the gutter. <p>

Jerry, after sleeping with his new girlfriend, decides that he doesn't 
like her. So, he asks a buddy how many more dates he has to waste on 
her so he can break up with her "like a gentleman."  
<p>
Has womanhood fallen so low in America? Is respect for females so 
absent, and the standards of gentlemanly conduct so warped? 
<p>
The answer is, "Yes." But, but, must we be continually reminded? 
<p>
I resolved -- after that episode, and others that were even worse -- 
to honor the old-time computer motto: "Garbage in, garbage out." 
<p>
Watching shows that featured members of my generation sinking to the 
bottom of a moral pit -- although being very witty in the process -- 
was bound to effect any viewer, eventually. Makes sense, doesn't it?   
<p>
So, I decided to go cold turkey. 
<p>
Now, I keep the TV tuned to either CNN, C-Span, or Nickelodeon, the 
cable station where Dick and Laura Petrie are still young, Mary Tyler 
Moore is still looking for a husband, and Lucy is still trying to get 
a spot in Ricky's nightclub act. 
<p>
Perhaps Nick at Night, advertised as "safe TV," has put me out of 
touch with popular culture. Recently, I asked a friend, "Did you watch 
Nick last night?" 
<p>
She replied, innocently, "Whose Nick?" 
<p>
And, last month, when I saw a road sign for New Rochelle during a trip 
to New York, I turned to a pal and asked, "Hey, do you know who lives 
there?"  
<p>
She didn't. 
<p>
But, a growing number of Americans could answer that question. TV 
shows that feature a better vision of America are making a comeback, 
as recounted in a recent Washington Times story. 
<p>
The article, titled, "Old television gives disgruntled viewers new 
hope," credits the "Dick Van Dyke" show -- set, of course, in New 
Rochelle, NY -- as being one of the most popular shows on "old TV." 
<p>
According to the article, Warner Brothers, Universal, Columbia and 
Paramount are all trying to start cable networks that will feature 
1960s and 1970s sitcoms. 
<p>
Old television is big. Very big. 
<p>
And, why not? The old shows remind us of a era, not so long ago, when 
Moms were at home when their kids came in the door from school, 
neighborhoods were safe, and marriages tended to last a lifetime. 
<p>
I was a baby when Dick Van Dyke made its original run in the 1960s, so 
I don't remember it first-hand. But, that was the America that I grew 
up in. Not such a bad world, after all. 
<p>
When I was a kid, my Mom used to send us out the door without worrying 
about us -- just like Laura did with Richie. Can you imagine? Even if 
we were a whole block away, there was another Mom nearby, keeping an 
eye on us through her kitchen window.  
<p>
The biggest part of our day was when Dad came home from work -- just 
like on the old sitcoms. We would crowd around him, looking for hugs. 
The dog would bark. It was general pandemonium. 
<p>
Now, the biggest part of the day for many American children is the 
moment when Dad or Mom walks through the door of their daycare center 
to take them home for a few short hours, before returning them the 
next morning. 
<p>
Today's network executives have a strange sense of what "family 
values" means. They claim their new fall lineup is dominated by family 
shows.  
<p>
But, the most normal family they could come up with is portrayed in 
"Bless This House." According to the previews, it portrays a family 
with "rock solid values."  
<p>
Unfortunately, the actor who plays the husband is Andrew Dice Clay -- 
a real-life comedian known for his obscene nightclub acts. 
<p>
In addition, TV executives this year came up with 10 new "family 
shows" with divorced or single parents. Some would call that being 
"realistic." I call it, "accentuating the negative." 
<p>
Also, on the heels of the already-established "NYPD Blue," touted as 
the first R-rated television series, there are at least a half-dozen, 
brand-new "adult" shows bent on breaking new ground. Half feature law 
firms. The rest feature news rooms. 
<p>
TV Guide describes one of them as containing "gratuitous lewdness." 
Remember -- in the eyes of TV Guide, that's not necessary meant to be 
critical.  
<p>
Another contains "risqué scenes." A third is described as "seductive." 
<p>
If the writing is good, and the story lines are interesting, the new 
R-style shows will probably attract even some Americans who try to 
live according to higher principles.  
<p>
And, despite their good intentions, they will slowly, bit by bit, be 
corroded.  
<p>
After all, garbage in, garbage out. 
<p>
Give me that old-time TV, any day of the week. 
<p>

<title>GRAMM:  CANDIDATE FOR THE NEW ENVIRONMENT</title>
</head>

<h2>GRAMM: CANDIDATE FOR THE NEW ENVIRONMENT</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
The Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary are just a year away, and the contestants for the 1996 GOP presidential nomination are already out of the gate and heading for the first turn.  With an unpopular Democratic incumbent likely to be on top of the ticket -- for the first time in sixteen years -- and with a historic victory in last November's midterm congressional elections, Republican challengers are fighting to win a nomination many see as virtually guaranteeing a four-year lease on the White House.<p>
One GOP presidential aspirant has a leg up on the competition -- and maybe an arm, as well.  In the view of many political insiders, in fact, he's been preparing to run for President for at least the last decade, with his sights set on the 1996 GOP nomination.  With a secure Senate seat, a national fund-raising apparatus to go with his prodigious fund-raising skills, and an issue clearly in vogue, he is likely to be one of the finalists for the GOP crown.<p>
He is U.S. Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, and though he has never before run for national office, he already is seen as a member of the GOP's top tier of presidential contenders.<p>
<b>THE NEW NOMINATING ENVIRONMENT</b><p>
Before we can begin a dispassionate analysis of a presidential contender's prospects, we must recognize the changes in the rules regarding the nominating process, and their likely impact on the contest itself.<p>
The formal 1996 nominating season will be shorter than any in recent memory.  Large states like California and New York -- which, between them, control one-third of all the electoral votes needed to capture the White House -- long have held their primary elections relatively late in the election season.  As a result, they had relatively little influence over the party nominees.  Party activists in those two states, tired of having to support candidates largely chosen for them by others in states with earlier primary elections, finally rebelled and decided to move their respective state's primary elections up on the calendar, to give them more influence over the process.  Key midwestern states -- Illinois, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan -- facing the loss of their own influence as a result of the California and New York moves, are now considering holding their primaries on the same day in mid-March, as sort of a Midwestern regional primary.<p>
The result:  with California moving from early June to late March, and with New York moving from late April to early May, more than seventy percent of the delegates to the 1996 GOP convention will be chosen within a six-week period from mid-February to the end of March.<p>
The impact of the scheduling change on the nominating race could hardly be more dramatic.  No longer will long-shot candidates have the luxury of plotting an insurgent upset in Iowa or New Hampshire, then coasting on free media while raising money over the next several weeks.  In the new environment, money will matter even more than previously; candidates simply won't have time to raise large amounts while in the heat of battle.  Most seasoned analysts expect that a candidate will have to have a minimum of $20-$25 million on hand on January 1, 1996, to have a serious shot at winning.  And the shortened time-frame means that name identification and media skills will increase in value, as well.<p>
This new environment, then, favors candidates with the ability to raise large amounts of money, who know how to present themselves well through the media, and who already have positive name identification.  On two of these three counts, Phil Gramm is well-armed for the competition.<p>
<b>GRAMM:  CANDIDATE FOR THE NEW ENVIRONMENT</b><p>
Money is the mother's milk of politics, now more than ever.  Of the last eight major party nominees for President -- that is, going back to the 1980 campaign -- seven were the candidates in their party who had the most money in the bank on December 31 of the year preceding the nomination contest.  The new primary schedule enhances the need for early money.  Gramm has some of the best fund-raising skills of any of the likely contestants -- including even Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole of Kansas, who has already run three national campaigns.  Even before the end of the 1994 election cycle, Gramm was far in front of the pack when measured by funds on hand for a potential run -- he had almost $8 million in the bank, as compared to about $2.5 million for Dole.  None of the other potential GOP candidates had even $1 million on hand.<p>
Too, Gramm knows how to raise money.  In his last Senate campaign, he spent more than $12 million; and since then, he has served four years as chairman of the Senate Republicans' campaign committee, the National Republican Senatorial Committee.  From his post at the NRSC, Gramm has had the opportunity to travel the country on behalf of dozens of GOP Senate candidates -- and, in the process, has acquainted himself with literally thousands of high-dollar donors, the kind who write $1,000 checks without a second thought.  It would not be too much of an exaggeration to say that every American who has contributed $5,000 or more to the GOP in the last four years probably has an autographed photograph of himself and Gramm hanging on the wall of his den or office.<p>
The second key to winning the GOP nomination will be positive name identification.  This is the chink in Gramm's armor.  As the field begins to shape up for 1996, Gramm runs far behind better-known party leaders like Bob Dole, Jack Kemp, Dan Quayle, and Dick Cheney.  In early trial polls, Gramm only captures 2-3 percent of the GOP vote against the field, while Dole and Kemp battle it out for first place in the low twenties and high teens.<p>
But name identification can be driven up with paid advertising -- as long as there is adequate money to finance it.  As noted above, Gramm will likely have more money to spend than any other candidate in the field.  Thus, it is the third key to the nomination -- media skills -- that likely will become the determining factor.<p>
Media skills can be broken down into PAID media skills and EARNED media skills.  "Paid" media is just that -- media advertising paid for with campaign dollars; "earned" media is time on the mass media earned by the candidate for making news in some way.<p>
Gramm's earned media skills have, for the most part, been little better than adequate.  His slow Texas twang turns off Northeasterners as much as it soothes Southerners; but his wit and his knack for framing issues serve him well in the studio interview setting.  He has been known to drone on in speeches to large gatherings; he is perhaps best-remembered for his long-winded and boring keynote speech to the 1992 GOP convention in Houston.<p>
But while Gramm may not be well-armed when it comes to basic earned media skills, when the battleground shifts to PAID media skills, there is not a stronger warrior on the field.  Gramm's television commercials are things of beauty, miniature movies -- not surprising, given the attention Gramm pays them, not to mention the money he lavishes on these mini-productions.<p>
In big states like New York and California, the ability to successfully communicate with the electorate through television advertising is THE key to success.  And that means just two things are needed:  a good flight of commercials, and the money to saturate the media.  Gramm will have both.<p>
<b>SOME NEGATIVES</b><p>
It's a good thing Gramm has money going for him, because he's got to overcome several handicaps on his way to the White House.  To begin, no Republican has gone directly from the Senate to the presidency in this century (and only one Democrat, John Kennedy, has made the trip); Senate experience appears not to be as great a plus as experience in a governor's mansion, which, with its executive decision-making prerogatives, is viewed by most voters as a better testing ground for the nation's chief executive.<p>
Moreover, Gramm -- long known to the public at large as a conservative activist -- starts with a relatively small base in his own party, as a result of the kind of internecine warfare among conservatives that threatens to divide their movement and render it politically impotent.<p>
At issue is Gramm's support for the 1990 budget deal -- which included what was then the biggest tax increase in the nation's history -- despite President Bush's promise of no new taxes.  While conservatives on and off Capitol Hill raged about the President's betrayal, Gramm loyally carried water for Bush, and was pilloried by purist conservatives for his apostasy.  The following year he opposed a Social Security payroll tax cut offered by Democratic Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, and even opposed another Social Security payroll tax cut -- combined with a capital gains tax cut -- offered by Republicans Malcolm Wallop and Tom DeLay.<p>
These heresies have given cause to some conservatives to think that Gramm -- a former economics professor at Texas A&M -- cares about only the spending side of the budget equation, and that he is unwilling to consider tax cuts as stimulative and necessary.  To most Americans, these arcane debates -- pitting minority factions of a minority party against one another -- remind them of nothing so much as Medieval arguments over how many angels will fit on the head of a pin; but to the conservative activists who have enormous influence over the nominating process of the Republican Party, they are important tests of purity.  If Gramm allows himself to be boxed in to a corner marked "green eye-shade Republican" along with Bob Dole, he will leave the economic optimist label open to others.<p>
But it's not just money and access to money that sets Gramm apart from the rest of the Republican field; it is another trait, deep in his bones.  In the words of one former House colleague of Gramm's, "Phil wakes up in the morning and thinks to himself, 'What are the ten things I need to do today to be President?' -- and then he gets seven of them done."  It is a driving ambition deep within Gramm, a determination to do what it takes in order to be President.??<p>

<title>BRADLEY TO REELECT CLINTON?</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">

<h2>BRADLEY TO REELECT CLINTON?</h2>
<i> by Bill Pascoe</i>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
Add Bill Bradley to a list that already includes Ross Perot, Colin Powell, and Jesse Jackson, and what do you have?  On the surface, a list of possible Independent candidates for the presidency -- but below the surface, a recipe for the reelection of Bill Clinton.<p>
For even as the political class muses loudly and publicly about the erosion of two-party politics and the breakdown of civil society -- both because the Establishment finds such talk interesting in an otherwise slow news month, and because it sells newspapers -- it blithely overlooks a fundamental fact gleaned from any in-depth analysis of American political history:  that national elections are about relatively simple choices; that much more often than not, those choices boil down to ONE simple question in the minds of most voters (to wit, Do I want to return the incumbent party for another four years in the White House?); and that, therefore, virtually any Independent candidacy (to the extent it is effective in its goal, which is to win votes) can have but one result -- the reelection of Bill Clinton.<p>
Of course, there are exceptions to the rule.  In 1996, the exception could be Mr. Jackson.  A Jackson Independent candidacy would likely have two effects, at least one of which would be good for the Democratic Party:  on the down side, a likely split-off of the black vote, with much of it going to Mr. Jackson, thereby making more difficult Mr. Clinton's chances for reelection; but on the good side,  an increased turnout among black voters, which could redound to the party's benefit in salvaging congressional seats that otherwise would be considered at risk.<p>
The jury is still out on whether Mr. Jackson will run or not.  The betting here is that he won't.  But that still leaves Messrs. Bradley, Powell, and Perot.<p>
And if even one of the three were to mount a serious Independent candidacy -- let alone a combination, or even, possibly, all three -- the likely result would be a renewal of Mr. Clinton's lease at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.<p>
Ah, the Conventional Wisdom says, of course that's true of potential Independent bids by Mr. Powell or Mr. Perot.  Both of them, according to the CW, would draw more heavily from the GOP presidential candidate.  Nothing new there.  But how would an Independent bid by a known Democrat like Mr. Bradley enhance Mr. Clinton's electoral prospects?  Wouldn't he draw from the  Democratic base vote, and weaken the President?<p>
No.  Mr. Clinton has a firm hold on his party's base vote.  Feminists, liberals, pro-abortionists, welfare recipients, gays, environmentalists, union members, public service employees -- the traditional Democratic coalition -- are still solidly behind the President, who has done as much as he can to deliver for them.  He was elected to office with 43 percent of the vote, and his approval ratings have hovered within a ten point range of that margin throughout his presidency, never dropping much below, even though he never gets too high.<p>
More importantly, any analysis that projects presidential results based on a simple reading of partisan loyalties -- or even ideological loyalties -- misses the point.  When push comes to shove in the polling booth, voters choose not on the basis of party or ideology, but on whether they want to give the incumbent party another four years in power.  Just ask Ken DeCell and Alan Lichtman, whose seminal book THE THIRTEEN KEYS TO THE PRESIDENCY remains the best analysis -- and projection 
model -- for explaining voter behavior in presidential elections.<p>
By their standards, a Perot or Powell candidacy would help Mr. Clinton not because they would split the GOP vote with the Republican candidate, but because they would split the ANTI- INCUMBENT vote with the Republican candidate.  (Interestingly, a close examination of exit polls from 1992 shows that, contrary to much of the Conventional Wisdom, Mr. Perot didn't actually hurt President Bush, he HELPED him, by splitting the anti-incumbent vote then, too; had Mr. Perot not run in 1992, the result would have been NOT a Bush reelection, but a Clinton LANDSLIDE victory.)<p>
Similarly, a Bradley Independent candidacy would provide a second option NOT for those inclined to return to Mr. Clinton to the White House, but to those seeking his removal.  And to the extent he waged a serious campaign and actually won serious votes, he would, necessarily and concomitantly, draw anti-incumbent votes from the anti-incumbent candidate -- e.g., the Republican nominee.<p>
Thus, in the unlikeliest of paradoxes, an Independent bid by a long-time Democrat unsatisfied with his party's presidential leadership would likely have just the opposite of its supposedly intended effect.<p>
Mr. Bradley has been accused of many things in his career, but being stupid isn't one of them.  The day before he announced his potential Independent candidacy, he claims to have called 120 people to tell them of his decision to retire from the Senate, and to discuss future options.  Would someone please send him Mr. DeCell's phone number?<p>

some very old advice</font></center><BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Ooooooooohh, does Bob Dole -- the real Bob Dole, not the prettied-up Bob Dole -- make the bimbos mad.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>It's too soon to know which Bob Dole we'll get by November, because some of his handlers, in the Nice Republican tradition, yearn for the applause of the aging liberals in the media.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Some others, on the other hand, understand that the ground across America has shifted. Some of the Nice Republicans think this is because they've got something on the bottom of their shoes, and the others understand the earthquake rumbling beneath their feet.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The Nice Republicans take their cues from The Washington Post, which they, like a lot of Washington, despise for its deceit and arrogance but nevertheless take their cues from it. Ignoring The Post is as difficult as ignoring the stink of a dead skunk under your bedroom window. It takes a stronger stomach than a lot of people were born with.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>So these Nice Republicans trembled on cue because Mr. Dole rebuked NBC-TV's Katie Couric for her adversarial scolding of Mr. Dole for his not joining the crusade against tobacco.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>"Instead," reported The Post July 4 on Page One, "the former Kansas senator, who volunteered his doubts about the addictiveness of cigarette smoking during a tour of tobacco-producing Kentucky almost three weeks ago, has continued to wage war with the news media on the issue" (italics mine).<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Wage war with the news media?<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Why, you might ask, would the news media -- news media being journalogical jargon for "reporters" -- be waging a war against a candidate for president of the United States in the first place? Don't the "news media" advertise themselves as neutral in these disputes? Odd that you should ask.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The Post's description of the parties in the dispute tells you even more about media neutrality: The candidate is "old Dole," who is the "picture of frustration," picking on Miss Couric, "a popular anchorwoman known for her perky image and big smile." <BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The description of Miss Couric is accurate enough as far as it goes, and fairly daring for the politically correct Post, because this is the shorthand of aging white guys, their lechery showing, for "the perky boobs, blond hair and empty head that are the requisites for network-news pinups."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>But it's not that Mr. Dole, treating Miss Couric with the respect that feminists say they despair of getting from old white guys like Mr. Dole, was picking on a little lady who merely parrots in a silkier voice what she hears the boys say. This is exactly how George Bush gobbled up Dan Rather for breakfast in a famous interview in 1988, which was grudgingly applauded even by the media notabilities who didn't like him, and the only difference between Mr. Rather and Miss Couric is that Katie is prettier.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mr. Dole, too bad for him, challenges a doctrine of media theology. Tobacco is this season's fashionable evil -- like eating steak and potatoes, or going to church. Enlightened people just don't indulge in such morbid things. (Speaking of behavior modification, the real old Dole would challenge President Clinton to scold gays for their addiction to practicing anal sex, the chief conductor of the AIDS virus, which is far deadlier than tobacco smoke.)<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>It's enough to make little Richard Cohen bang his rattle against the wall on the op-ed page at The Post: ". . . he went after [Miss] Couric, the Dorothy of our early morning Oz." (Won't someone please send this poor guy a man-size box of Kleenex?)<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>There's evidence, scant but nevertheless just visible, to suggest that Mr. Dole is at last paying occasional attention to his own instincts. Only in Washington can you hear grown-ups question the universally held belief that the media are relentlessly liberal, or suggest that a candidate is out of step for saying what everyone already thinks.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mr. Dole has been in politics long enough, longer than his armchair skeptics, to understand that neither he nor anyone else will take down Bill Clinton with a campaign designed to please the League of Women Voters. He'll have to fight with the tenacity, energy, guile and shrewdness of Mr. Clinton, who in turn will fight with the artifice, deception and cunning that propelled him from the casino-and-racetrack culture of Hot Springs to the hothouse of Washington and the White House.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The rap on Mr. Clinton is that he has elevated phoniness to high art. You might not like Bob Dole's indulgence of tobacco smoke, or even his treating a network bimbo with the respect he accords his other media adversaries, but the anger looks authentic. His only hope for November is that authenticity is what America is yearning for. America, not America's media, is the authentic constituency.<BR><BR><FONT SIZE="-2">Copyright &copy; 1996 News World Communications, Inc.</FONT>

SRC="/wash_times/pruden.gif"> <BR><FONT SIZE=6>Dreamy dreams for an August
morning</FONT></center><BR><DD>Suppose you're Bob Dole and you wake up on a Monday morning in
August, pick up The Washington Post (the quickest way to ruin your day), and there on the front
page is more bad news:<BR><DD>Bill Clinton has just been indicted for mopery, Hillary is a
fugitive from justice last seen in Nepal, and Janet Reno has appointed a special prosecutor to
press charges that Socks the Cat has been hunting mice out of season.<BR><DD>But a new poll,
commissioned just in time for the Republican National Convention in San Diego, shows the
president 31 points up on you, and you're only 6 points ahead of Ross Perot.<BR><DD>Ordinarily,
this would curdle the cream in your coffee, but the cream had turned sour weeks earlier. You
decide to drink your coffee black, to match your mood. You sit there, staring at the trees on
Roosevelt Island across the Potomac (which looks particularly bleak), and your mind begins to
examine the possibilities:<BR><DD><I>Hmmmmmmmmm. George McGovern is a nice guy, a good friend,
but do I really want to be remembered as the man who made the Nixon-McGovern blowout look like a
cliff-hanger? And Fritz Mondale -- always liked him. Good man. Wrong on some stuff, not so bad
on other stuff. But do I really want to challenge his mark of winning only a single state? The
numbers from Kansas don't look so hot, either.</I><BR><DD><I>Got to do something. Maybe make
another speech. Start wearing a tie again. Put new pennies in my loafers. Take Katie Couric out
to lunch. Get a new bathing suit. Buy some jokes. Whatever. Nah, it wouldn't last. Been there,
done that. Maybe call Colin Powell one more time. Nah, been there, too. Besides, he's like all
the other generals, waiting for somebody to appoint him president. Got enough of generals in
Italy.</I><BR><DD><I>What if ... Nah, too bold. Better to lose it all in November. Except . . .
Nah, better wait 'til Liddy leaves the room even to think these thoughts. Ah, there she goes ...
What if . . . I call a press conference and announce that I'm stepping aside. Had some chest
pains, back pains. Pains in the neck. Whatever. Gonna throw the convention open. No endorsement.
Not from me. The ultimate act of loyalty and generosity from the ultimate party man. Who else
would be remembered as being so unselfish? Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid
of the party. Only I actually will. Let the right-to-lifers and the abortionists slug it out.
See how far Pat Buchanan gets in an open convention. Let's see who's got the uh, nerve, to get
in now. Jack Kemp won't. He's afraid he might run third. Or fourth. Never called fourth-and-one
in his life. I won't play any favorites, but I might get somebody to nominate Colin. We'll see
how the general who couldn't get to Baghdad fares with all those ex-privates and ex-corporals
out there in the convention hall. Whatever.</I><BR><DD>Well, of course it won't happen. Nobody
with a politician's ego would forego the moment of watching himself being nominated for
president of the United States, standing up there waving to a standing ovation big enough to
fill a stadium and loud enough to make a man's mother believe some of them actually mean it. But
it is a thought, and if such wistful musings ever occur to Bob Dole it doesn't take a Hollywood
scriptwriter to imagine what would happen.<BR><DD>The country would be electrified, and here,
finally, is the place to use that cliche. Direct current at 240 volts. The reporters and
commentators would go bonkers, finally getting to cover a nominating convention like they had in
those old black-and-white newsreels. The good, gray Republican Party, where a simple
disagreement over where to go for dinner is considered gauche, finally giving lessons to the
Democrats, who can start a floor fight over a resolution commending Mother Teresa for giving
milk to starving babies, about how to conduct a free-for-all.<BR><DD><I>Mister Chairman, Alabama
is proud to cast its votes on the 29th ballot for . . . </I><BR><DD>ABC would pull its camera
crews from Bosnia, CBS would call back reporters from Tel Aviv, CNN would forsake its stakeout
of O.J. The newspapers would double their staffs in San Diego, with finally something to
actually write home about. <BR><DD>The delegates in San Diego would forget all about the beach,
the side trips to Tijuana, the cocktail parties aboard the yachts tied up in the
harbor.<BR><DD>Best of all, the race would be transformed overnight.<BR><DD>By waiting until
August to bequeath his great gift to the party, Bob Dole would guarantee an open convention.
Nobody would have time to raise the money to ruin it in the way that the primaries have ruined
the process, and at last the Republicans could tell little Virginia that yes, Virginia, there
really is a Republican National Convention, and this is how it's supposed to
be.<BR><DD><I>Mister Chairman, Alabama is proud to stand fast on the 44th ballot for . .

<BR><FONT SIZE=6>Let's blame the dead for the scary stuff</FONT></center><BR><DD>These guys at the White House are fast learners.<BR>
  George Stephanopoulos sees how Mortuary Bob Woodward gets by with talking to men lying in comas and crediting the most unlikely assertions in his books to sources conveniently dead, so George does it, too.<BR><DD>It wasn't Hillary who hired Craig Livingstone to vacuum raw FBI files to put together dossiers on their Republican enemies, says the president's senior adviser. "It was Vince Foster."<BR><DD>Dead men not only tell no tales, they don't dispute tales, either.<BR><DD>This emboldens Hillary. She was in Romania and Eastern Europe for the Fourth of July holiday (where she didn't have to put up with a lot of tacky flag-waving by men in military uniform parading down the avenue), but she supports Mr. Stephanopoulos in his blaming of Vince Foster, who, though still dead, has his uses yet.<BR><DD>Said she, repeating the White House mantra the nation has heard over and over in Clintonoid answers, some under oath and some not, to all questions about Whitewater: "I don't know anything about it."<BR><DD>She has no idea who hired the hapless Mr. Livingstone: "I know I didn't."<BR><DD>She doesn't like Gary Aldrich's new book, either. "It is a politically inspired fabrication, and I don't think anyone should take it seriously."<BR><DD>But the White House is taking it seriously indeed, mounting a full-scale offensive we hadn't seen since, well, since Bill and Hillary attacked Gennifer Flowers' claims that she had been Mr. Clinton's main squeeze for years and years in Little Rock, when Miss Flowers produced a tape recording of beddy-bye conversation that included Mr. Clinton's suggestion that Mario Cuomo was a Mafia asset. (Mr. Clinton denied saying it, of course, but apologized the next day to Mr. Cuomo for saying what he never said. Of course, it never happened, but he would never do it again.)<BR><DD>Americans soon learned what Arkansans had learned before them, to their considerable sorrow, never to take the first denial as the last word from either Clinton.<BR><DD>Mr. Stephanopoulos, citing widespread coverage of the Aldrich book by newspapers and lecturing David Brinkley on the ethics of journalism, complains that Washington newspapermen and journalists seem willing to believe anything malicious, salacious or promiscuous about his bosses. Journalists, in his view, don't enforce a high-enough credibility threshold.<BR><DD>What he means is that when someone tells the story that the prez sneaks off in the middle of the night to visit a bimbo -- no doubt to discuss Bosnia policy -- almost everyone is likely to believe it. True or not, the most risible rumor has the ring of truth. Sad that may be, but whose fault is that? Nothing but hoots of disbelief would have greeted a story like that about Jimmy Carter. The trouble Mr. Clinton and his men have on occasions like this is that he, like Jimmy Carter, has a track record.<BR><DD>We've all come to recognize the track record. First the denial -- in the case of the Aldrich book, not exactly a categorical denial -- and then the White House smear attacking "the Republican smear." Finally, days or weeks later, the facts dribble out, confirming the original story.<BR><DD>We're near the end of the first stage of this controversy, with Mr. Stephanopoulos attacking not Gary Aldrich, but Bob Dole, of all people, demanding that he disavow the book that has so panicked the White House, but that Mr. Dole has had nothing to do with.<BR><DD>The White House is not really concerned about the reputations of either Clinton. It's too late for that. But if the allegations in the Aldrich book -- like the allegations in the Meredith Oakley book, the Roger Morris book, the James Stewart book, the Bob Tyrrell book to come, take a number -- begin to stick, it's curtains for the Clintons. At some point the wonderfully/woefully tolerant American public will decide that we've had enough of Flem Snopes' grandson and his unblushing parvenue bride.<BR><DD>The White House knows how to read polls, and knows what not to attribute to them. <BR><DD>The Wall Street Journal reported only last week how some Democratic congressional candidates, even in liberal districts, are putting a little distance between themselves and the president.<BR><DD>Says John Tierney, a Democratic candidate in Massachusetts: "I'm campaigning on my own strengths." Says Steve Eastaugh, a Democratic challenger in Maryland: "A person's not worth spit if he doesn't defend his team captain. But I don't defend Clinton." Even the Democratic candidate to succeed Patsy Schroeder in Colorado says, with emphasis, that she's "not a Clinton Democrat."<BR><DD>"They're being prudent," says Charles Cook, a political analyst. "They don't know what's coming next." Too bad for George, but who does?<BR><BR><FONT SIZE="-2">Copyright &copy; 1996 News World Communications, Inc.</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=6>It's 1996, and we're all from Arkansas</FONT></center><BR><DD>What a country. (If the polls are correct.) Most Americans think the president is probably a crook, more than half of them think his wife is the family bag man and a shrew besides, and 62 percent have concluded that the administration they preside over uses the power of the government to intimidate and blackmail private citizens.<BR><DD>And they want four more years of it.<BR><DD>Bill Clinton leads Bob Dole by 17 points, or 20, or 22, or 6. Whatever. Take the poll of your choice. Talk about the Stockholm Syndrome.<BR><DD>This is good news for people who sell newspapers, because the Scandal/Outrage/Screw-up of the Day sells newspapers. It's a shame for the country, but the bigger shame appears to be that the country doesn't any longer give a damn who a president is or what he does. Hot Springs is at last writ large.<BR><DD>A poll taken for the Wall Street Journal/NBC News and released late last week, not only shows Mr. Clinton up by a ton, but 44 percent are down on Hillary, 62 percent think she's lying about past deeds of graft and greed, 35 percent say they believe the president helped himself to public money to cover his Whitewater investment, and 68 percent say they believe the Clinton White House is using the FBI, illegally, to bullyrag opponents.<BR><DD>New revelations litter the landscape, if not yet the public consciousness. The books pour out a profusion of perversion, greed, incompetence and criminal bumbling. The Clinton crowd is exposed as a collision of clowns or crooks, and probably both. It's not the comedy, stupid, it's the stupidity.<BR><DD>We've become such a nation of soap-opera addicts, having mainlined Oprah and Phil Donahue and their cretinous compatriots for so long that we no longer aspire to be "the good nation" that Alexis de Tocqueville found here almost 200 years ago, when he observed that America was great because it was good and predicted that America would cease to be great when it ceased to be good.<BR><DD>We live in the New Age now, and happy is as happy does. A new book out this week, "Unlimited Access," by Gary Aldrich, an FBI agent assigned to the White House, details how the president assuages his melancholy memories of Gennifer, Sally, Paula, Kay and the other ladies of the wee hours he left behind in Little Rock. Mr. Aldrich describes how the prez leaps into the back seat of Bruce Lindsey's car, pulls a blanket over his head and doesn't come out until they're safely in a tunnel beneath the JW Marriott Hotel, just down Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House. He takes an elevator to a suite upstairs, where the late evening's yum-yum awaits. This would be the hour for the bad guys to unleash missiles, since nobody knows where he is for hours and hours. Hillary is safe in the arms of the Sandman.<BR><DD>This beats the arrangements in Little Rock, where he was reduced to using the front seat of a car on the deserted grounds of his daughter's school or the back seat of his limo on a side street at the foot of Main. But let's be fair. Bill Clinton is not the first president to slip around with the satin smoothness of the son of a preacher man. Warren Harding made a love nest of a closet off the Oval Office. Grover Cleveland made out like Bill Clinton before he got to Washington, leaving a love child in his wake, and JFK partook often of the consolations of forbidden feminine charms and, in a fit of populist bonhomie, even shared his treats with a Mafia don.<BR><DD>FDR had a squeeze, too, but his was a vice that paid the homage of hypocrisy to virtue, and nobody knew for sure for years afterward. This was in part due to diligence and careful competence, and in part the work of media that protect Democrats to conserve energies to ravage Republicans. Bob Packwood was hounded from office for kissing women in elevators, but when Bill Clinton was caught at dropping his drawers and demanding curb service it was his accuser who was held up to public ridicule. "I'm not interested in Bill Clinton's sex life," said Johnny Apple of the New York Times in a widely quoted (and widely copied) dismissal of the larger part of Bill Clinton's life and career.<BR><DD>Some people say that this merely reflects selective distaste, but Mr. Apple is not the only man in town who finds sex a vice unfit for the consideration of gentlemen. But polls indicate that a mean average of 61.3 percent of the rest have concluded that vice is nice at twice the price, and Bill Clinton is our man.<BR><DD>Robbing banks in Arkansas is old stuff, and doesn't count. Covering it up in Washington is what anybody would have done. Using the FBI to compile dossiers on "enemies" is sort of shoddy, but Republicans deserve it. Billy Dale might have been Everyman, but thinking about it can make a man's teeth itch.<BR><DD>Too bad for Bob Dole, but that's the way the cookie -- whoever she may be -- crumbles. We're all from Arkansas now.<BR><BR><FONT SIZE="-2">Copyright &copy; 1996 News World Communications, Inc.</FONT>

<IMG SRC="/wash_times/pruden.gif"><BR><font size=7>A familiar odor from<BR>
the summer of '73</font></center><BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Bill Clinton is not a crook. We have Chris Dodd's word on it.<BR>
  And the word of Paul Sarbanes, Mary McGrory, Richard Cohen, Jim Hoagland, Tom Lantos and maybe Norman Ornstein. And Mark Fabiani's and Mike McCurry's.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The Democratic defensive line -- the politicians, academics and journalists who work hard to make our lives happy and productive, if only we would listen to them -- assures us that despite all the evidence that the ganglion of criminal scandal called Whitewater may look like a duck, walk like a duck and even quack like a duck, it's really a turkey.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Nothing upsets these refined worthies more than for someone to remark on the obvious, that the Clinton White House smells like the Nixon White House, that the flavor of the Clintonoid excuses, rationalizations and tortured justifications is remarkably similar to the taste of stale Nixonian leftovers, and that Pennsylvania Avenue reeks of the aroma that old-timers remember from the summer of '73.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>"On my scorecard," writes Jim Hoagland in The Washington Post, "the president has endured a couple of bad but far from fatal weeks as the Senate Whitewater committee rolled out its final, conflicting reports, old associates in Arkansas were convicted in crooked land deals and House hearings revealed the White House's improper possession of more than 400 FBI investigative files. All that hurts, but there was no smoking gun: The Clintons were not personally and conclusively linked to major scandal."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Say what? Mr. Hoagland, a genial fellow who has heretofore successfully disguised himself as a wise-policy wonk and good-government groupie, thus reduces the Clinton White House "enemies list," to which he insists the Clintons are not "conclusively linked" even though it happened in their house, from outrage to merely a matter of "impropriety." We didn't hear this kind of excuse for Chuck Colson, who went to prison for the possession of a single FBI file.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mary McGrory, still waiting for JFK to float out of his grave at Arlington to rescue Camelot, mocks the Republicans on the Whitewater committee as witch-hunters: "They put a pointed hat on Hillary Clinton ... and they all but called her ... the wicked witch of the White House. But that doesn't make it Watergate. She isn't the president." Evita Peron wasn't the president of Argentina, either, but she did a good imitation of the maximum leader. (Don't cry for me, Arkansas.)<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Tom Lantos, the congressman from California, turned livid the other day when someone on Bill Clinger's committee, investigating Hillary's beheading of Billy Dale, remarked on the perfectly obvious, that the Clintons, who matured, sort of, in the Watergate years, learned nothing from that experience, except how to do it better.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Paul Sarbanes, who hectored the Nixon men without mercy for crimes less outrageous than those for which the Clinton men -- and women -- have implicated themselves and each other, finds the Clintons guiltless of doing anything wrong in Washington and even perfectly innocent of anything shady in Arkansas. (Ain't nobody here but us chickens.) Richard Cohen, the conscience of The Washington Post, assures us that he took time out from his bizarre feud with blacks to personally investigate the FBI files scandal and found nothing to worry about. (So there.) The good gray Norman Ornstein, also writing in The Post, says what went wrong at the White House was a bureaucratic snafu after all: The Clintons cut the size of the White House staff, and shouldn't have, because what they (and we) actually need in Washington are more bureaucrats.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>For their part, the Clintons keep sending poor Mark Fabiani out to tell the reporters artless fibs, stretchers, fables, myths and yarns every time another scandal rocks the house. The president has put him in the position of the man who, caught by his wife between the sheets with her best friend, tells his wife: "I guess you'll try to make something out of this."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mr. Fabiani will be on call over the next few weeks as the second Whitewater trial proceeds in Little Rock, where two bankers are on trial for robbing their bank in behalf of Bill Clinton when he needed the last few sacks of cash to sew up his gubernatorial election in 1990.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mr. Clinton's fingerprints, so far as we know, were not on the deal. David Hale, his earlier banker angel, says Mr. Clinton was always insistent that his hands never touch the deals he designed.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Bill Clinton, up 20 points in the polls and looking at disgrace and ruin, is his daddy's salesman son, still trying to sell the notion that nobody but David Hale, a convicted felon, has accused him of anything illegal. But one by one the president's men are becoming convicted felons.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Sort of reminds people with long memories of Richard Nixon.<BR><BR><FONT SIZE="-2">Copyright &copy; 1996 News World Communications, Inc.</FONT>

<p><font size=7>Trying to beat nothing<BR>
with not very much</font></center><BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Bob Dole poses an interesting question for America in 1996: Can a man with no strength of his convictions beat a man with the strength of no convictions?<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mr. Dole seems determined to campaign on a platform that can be boiled down to a forgettable bumper sticker: "Vote Republican: We're Not as Bad as You Think We Are."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Bill Clinton's message, no less succinct, is the mirror image of the Republican slogan: "Vote Democratic: You're Right, We Bad -- And You Ain't Seen Nothin' Yet."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>This sets up an interesting Hobson's choice, with each alternative worse than the other, and the answer may tell us not only who the president will be, but a lot about who we are as a people. Bill Clinton and his campaign-year alter ego, Dickie Morris, understand that almost everybody mistrusts Mr. Clinton, many regarding him as a liar like his wife and a fraud like no other, but an amiable fraud nonetheless and a likable liar besides. Not only that, he's famous. Mr. Clinton and his guru believe that since America now keeps pace with fiction, liars rule.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Bob Dole is a man of character and principle, even if he gives the impression that he doesn't understand what that means, exactly. In any event, he gives the impression that he's not really serious about wanting to be president. He seems to think the presidency is something like being a senator, only bigger, if not necessarily better. He believes in things, but not too much, which is good, but he's not as famous as Bill Clinton, which is not so good.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The poor guy has been so long in the Senate, where cutting deals is the mark of leadership, that when he closes a sale now, he can't shut up. He had the abortion question squared and boxed, safely on the shelf, with all the Christian "extremists" willing to put their suspicions aside, and then somebody or something persuaded him that Colin Powell and John Warner and Christie Whitman and the pro-choice wing of the party deserved a little lagniappe. Having flaunted his tolerance in the face of the conservatives, he shoved it down their throats.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>He expects to bask in the applause of the liberals and Democrats whose approval such Republicans not-so-secretly covet. We'll see how long he has to wait for that. Within minutes after his tribute to the successes of 1970s liberalism in his farewell address to the Senate, all but ignoring the legacy of Ronald Reagan in his rush to shower accolades on the Democrats who thwarted the Gipper's revolution, the Democratic National Committee in return faxed a bulletin to political writers listing 10 bad things Mr. Dole had done as a senator. (Note to Colin Powell: They're ready for you.)<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Given the givens, selling himself as the lesser evil is not necessarily a hopeless strategy. Despite the piously naive cliches of the political-science professors, the pundits and the good-government groupies, most people vote against, not for. Bill Clinton has disillusioned a lot of his 43 percent of '92, but if he has persuaded many in the 57 percent who voted against him in '92 that he's better than they thought he was, it's difficult to find them.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>No one understands this better than Mr. Clinton and Dickie Morris. That's why Mr. Clinton is running this year as a conservative Republican. He'll steal every issue Bob Dole lets him steal, understanding that he can't fool all the people all the time, but with a little Clinton luck maybe he can fool enough.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>What terrifies the president and the man behind the curtain is the sure and certain knowledge that, despite everything the media elites can do to persuade everyone otherwise, Americans are growing more, not less, conservative. A poll taken last month for USA Today demonstrates that 83 percent of Americans favor a balanced budget, 83 percent want to prohibit racial preferences (i.e., scrap affirmative action), 82 percent want to make English the official language, 80 percent want life sentences imposed on drug dealers, 74 percent want term limits, 73 percent want prayer in the schools, 73 percent oppose legalization of marijuana, 71 percent want to cut off welfare to deadbeats, 71 percent want to reduce the number of government agencies, 67 percent oppose same-sex "marriage," and 57 percent oppose partial-birth abortions.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Exact or not, such percentages tell Mr. Clinton -- and almost any other politician who can stay awake through the second cup of coffee -- who the real extremists are, and that there's no percentage in diluting a conservative message.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>That's why he intends to run to the right of Bob Dole if the Republican nominee lets him. Mr. Dole and his compassioneers, full of moderation and meekness, may persuade a few people that he's not as bad as they think he is, but he'll never get anyone to throw his hat in the air with a message like that. An army marches on its stomach, and you can't win a war on milk and toast.<BR><BR><FONT SIZE="-2">Copyright &copy; 1996 News World Communications, Inc.</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=6>The limited hangout at the White House</FONT></center><BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Nothing makes Bill Clinton and Miss Hillary and their friends jump quite like barking the words "Nixon" and "Watergate" at them, in the manner of thrusting a cross in the face of Count Dracula.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Like the count, they quail.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>You can almost see the beads of perspiration breaking out in the hollow of Miss Hillary's pretty throat, and the president reddens like a schoolboy caught with a hot book hidden between the covers of his geography text.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>There's no sign yet of the ghost of Richard Nixon, but he can't be pleased by the comparison, either. Fortunately, it's difficult to libel the dead.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The first lady, who worked as a staff lawyer for the congressional committees working to bring down Mr. Nixon an eon ago, is a quick study and she learned a lot. Her mistake, as it may turn out, is that she thought she could make the Nixon strategy work in her husband's White House.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mr. Nixon's men came up with what they called "the modified limited hangout," the paying out of as few of the sordid details of the Watergate scandal as possible in hopes that the press would go away.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mr. Clinton's men are similarly paying out the sordid details of the Whitewater collection of scandals -- any one of which might be worse than the third-rate burglary of the offices of the Democratic National Committee at the Watergate Office Building on Virginia Avenue NW -- in the hopes that the press, with an attention span shorter than you could find in any kindergarten class, will get bored and go away.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The modified limited hangout is not working any better for the Clintons than it did for Mr. Nixon, for whom ultimately it did not work at all. Pity the poor spokesmen at the White House. Not only are they asked to tell fibs, distortions and stretchers to the reporters, some of whom are finally getting it, but the fibs, distortions and stretchers change every hour on the hour.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Late last week, Mr. Clinton's hapless excuses men came up with the third and fourth explanations of why the president's lawyer (and we can assume that a smart Yale lawyer like Bill Clinton knew about it all the time) tried to get the confidential FBI files on Billy Dale, covering 30 years of his life, seven months after the first lady ordered him fired as director of the White House travel office.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Rep. William Clinger of Pennsylvania suggests that Bernard Nussbaum, who was the president's lawyer, sought the FBI documents because even then the White House was concocting a smear job on Mr. Dale. Naturally, Mr. Nussbaum couldn't remember sending the request to the FBI. Nobody in this White House ever remembers anything. This is the first White House in history to make Alzheimer's disease, with its consequent loss of memory, a helpful qualification for employment.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Then someone at the White House had another bright idea. Maybe someone could say that Mr. Dale was being considered for another White House position, and they needed the background checks to make sure they knew who he was. He had only worked for the U.S. government for three decades. This was an excuse first tried at the Nixon White House when, in a celebrated fiasco, it got caught putting together a dossier on a prominent Washington reporter and then insisted that he was being considered for an important job in the administration.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>But wait! The FBI dossier was not asked for by Bernie Nussbaum, who as everybody knows would never pull a dirty trick, but by the General Accounting Office. Drat! Then the GAO said no, it had never asked for nor looked at FBI files on Mr. Dale.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Back to the drawing board once more: The White House said it asked the FBI for the files by "accident" when it routinely sought background reports on all White House employees. Bernie, George, Bruce, Patsy, Harold, Maggie, maybe even Hillary. Not just Billy and the boys, but everyone in the Goodtime Gang.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>This was too much for Louis Freeh, the director of the FBI. He certainly doesn't want to do a Patrick Gray imitation, and be left twisting slowly, slowly in the wind. He ordered a full investigation of the White House request for the FBI dossier.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>"He certainly doesn't want the bureau mixed up in this stuff," says an official at FBI headquarters. "He has moved to make sure that the public's perception is that there's not some cozy relationship between the White House and bureau executives."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>This is surely a puzzlement to the president, accustomed to using the State Police for all manner of conveniences when he was the governor of Arkansas. Puzzling to the first lady as well, who thought she had learned from the errors of the Nixon White House and imagined that the failure was not in conception, but in execution.<BR><BR><FONT SIZE="-2">Copyright &copy; 1996 News World Communications, Inc.</FONT>

Learning lessons,<BR>all of them wrong
</FONT></center>

<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30
HEIGHT=0>When Jefferson Davis was inaugurated as the president of the
Confederacy on the steps of the Capitol in Montgomery, he and the occasion were
acclaimed as the time and place where "the man and the hour have met."<BR><IMG
SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>We may be on the scene of
another occasion when the planets align themselves with reckless abandon and
God throws down the stars in a fit of divine disgust. Bill Clinton, the man, and
the nation, in an hour of disarray, have met.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT=""
ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Disaster followed Davis, and disaster is no doubt
stalking us, too. Billy Graham said it best the other day when he came to
Washington to receive the Medal of Freedom: "... the greatest nation in history
stands on the brink of self-destruction."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top
WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The signs of unraveling are certainly all about. The chief of
the Navy, having presided over the emasculation of the greatest sea service in
the history of man (presuming Atlantis had nothing better), shoots himself in the
chest, which almost anyone's elderly aunts, armed with their modest knowledge
of firearms, could have told him was not the way to do it. He was afraid someone
might think he was wearing his medals crooked.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT=""
ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>This was the most dramatic Washington suicide
since James Forrestal, the secretary of defense, leaped from a window at the top
of Bethesda Naval Hospital in 1947, pursued by the vicious demons and fierce
worms known only to himself, haunted by fears of the red menace when it was
not fashionable to be so haunted. It's already the second major suicide of the
Clinton administration, and as the going gets tougher, the curveballs breaking
ever more sharply across the plate, all the president's men must stand resolute
against despair.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30
HEIGHT=0>Like Vince Foster, Mike Boorda was by all accounts a man of splendid
character and moral stature, but, like Mr. Foster, he was over his head in the pool
of ego and ambition that the capital is and has been since the days when someone
was forever trying to set fire to George Washington's wooden teeth.<BR><IMG
SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>What other explanation can
there be for the suicide of a warrior who is expected to dispatch 19-year-old
boys -- and pregnant 19-year-old girls, to make the most shameful point -- to
court a briny death on the stormy sea but who so quails at the prospect of talking
to a reporter that he takes the weak man's out?<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT=""
ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>It's difficult to imagine that an old salt as
experienced as Mike Boorda would have killed himself over the misuse of his
medals, as dear as such decorations are to the men who understand the sacrifice
required to win them. It's not so difficult to understand why Washington, with its
unerring instinct for getting it wrong, took a crash course last week in how many
pins can dance on a campaign ribbon.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top
WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Adm. Boorda, though skillful enough at playing the
bureaucratic game to make it to the top of the sea service, might have understood
that at the end he had let down his beloved Navy by betraying it into the hands of
snotty Clintonoids who think that no opportunity must be missed to emasculate
the military the commander in chief has said he "loathes."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif"
ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The admiral conceded months before his
death that he reckoned that he had let down the Navy by caving in to the
pressures brought by the neurotic feminists inside and outside the Congress, and
the frightened senators (some of them Republicans) leaping to chairs, pulling up
their pants' legs to cry "eeeek!" when Pat Schroeder walks into the room, who
demanded the head of Adm. Stanley Arthur when he was nominated to be the
commander of the Pacific Command.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top
WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Adm. Arthur, a 500-mission hero of the Vietnam War
(enough already to condemn him to scorn and ridicule), was accused of reaching
an incorrect judgment when a female pilot filed a sexual-harassment claim
against her flight instructors. Upon investigation, Adm. Arthur ruled the claim
without substantial merit. The poor woman should count her lack of blessings;
she might have been assigned to the USS Acadia, "the Love Boat," which returned
from the Persian Gulf War with 10 percent of her crew in a family way, more in
need of diapers and bassinets than armor and bullets.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif"
ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The promotion was held up by a single
senator, the self-righteously strange David Durenberger of Minnesota. "I should
have fought this to the end," Adm. Boorda conceded to the Navy Times. "I helped
screw it up, and I don't feel good about it."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT=""
ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>That made everything A-OK, of course. "Feeling
good" is what life in Bill Clinton's America is all about. But not to everyone. Jim
Webb, another authentic hero of Vietnam who was Ronald Reagan's secretary of
the Navy, demanded of the weak John Dalton, the Clintonoid secretary of the Navy,
and of Mike Boorda: "Where was the outrage?"<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT=""
ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>But outrage is not appropriate in a Navy fit for a
lady, and a ladies' Navy is what we've got.

No cheap sentiment<BR>for his generation
</FONT></center>

<BR><DD>Gentlemen (and ladies): Start your spinning.

<BR><DD> This is the Bob Dole nobody expected to see, lean and tough and poignant without the cheap sentiment, and from the White House to the newsrooms of the elites (and some who only dream of being among the elites), the favorite adjective was &quot;desperate.&quot;

<BR><DD>&quot;The irony of Dole's decision ... is that one of the pivots of Dole's campaign was in fact an admission of his defeat&quot; (from the Boston Globe). The announcement &quot;is a drastic bid to unyoke himself from an unpopular Republican Congress ...&quot; (from the San Jose Mercury News). &quot;A bold maneuver, full of potential perils - not the least the possibility that an electorate weary of tactics and stratagems would see his resignation from the Senate as just another gimmick ...&quot; (from the New York Times).

<BR><DD>Some of the punditry was born of the amnesia that strikes nearly everyone who has lived in Washington long enough to get a telephone. Says Peter Hart, the Democratic pollster: &quot;Dole will live to rue the day. ... It's too tactical. You're denying your career. It's like going back to Russell and announcing you're moving to New York.&quot;

<BR><DD>Kevin Phillips, the Democrats' favorite Republican analyst, agreed: &quot;I don't think this puts a whole lot of electricity in his socket. He can go out and give speeches, but the speeches he gave before were no good.&quot; Concurred Stephen Hess of the Brookings Institution, echoing the favorite spinsters' word of the day: &quot;It sounds like a strategy that's a good deal more desperate than the situation demands now.&quot;

<BR><DD>There's no doubting that Mr. Dole was in tough shape - dire straits, a panic, up a creek without the paddle, almost any of the cliches the pundits rush to employ. But the speech, one of the most memorable campaign speeches since Ronald Reagan's famous speech for Barry Goldwater in 1964, does not strike the ears of Middle America as a gimmick, a stratagem or even a tactic. (Most people forgive politicians their tactics, even when they shoot trespassers.)

<BR><DD>Mr. Dole sounded at last like a man who knew what he was doing, who was saying what he thinks because he was speaking from the heart. His careful, precise allusion to his heroic service in World War II struck just the right grace note. There is life after all beyond a company job in the ultimate company town: &quot;I will be the same man I was when I walked into the room, the same man I was yesterday and the day before, and a long time ago when I arose from my hospital bed and was permitted by the grace of God to walk again in the world. And I trust in the hard way, for little has come to me except in the hard way, which is good because we have a hard task ahead of us.&quot;

<BR><DD>He does, indeed. But when he speaks his mind from his heart, it rings as true as the sound of distant battle. Speaking this way now, after so many months of avoiding all sentiment because he was afraid it would sound like cheap sentiment, makes it all the more believable. If hardly anyone can imagine authentic sincerity from Bill Clinton, who will say everything about anything to anybody, hardly anyone doubts that the tears and the choked sobs were real. Nobody, said Steve Forbes after watching the remarkable ceremony on television, can pucker a lip like Bill Clinton, and only the most foolish of fools would try.

<BR><DD>The most heartfelt part of the Dole farewell was the hardest for Washington to credit: &quot;My campaign for the president is not merely about obtaining office. It's about fundamental things, consequential things, things that are real. My campaign is about telling the truth, it's about doing what is right, it's about electing a president who's not attracted to the glories of the office, but rather its difficulties.&quot;

<BR><DD>Lincoln's famous observation about not being able to fool all the people all the time will get its test this year. Bill Clinton has a lot of things going for him - youth, vigor, the gift of gab unencumbered by steadfast principle or heartfelt conviction - and the greatest of all is his confident reliance on the cheerful willingness of the public to cut a little slack to a roguish shill.

<BR><DD>Mr. Dole is embarked on a mission to see how many adults are left in America. He has said that he thinks a man of his generation, arguably the bravest and most dependable since the nation sent two mighty armies to battle against each other and there was enough left over to tame a frontier and build a constellation of gleaming cities, has enough left over this time for one final mission.

<BR><DD>Like Hernando Cortes, the Spanish conquistador who burned his boats on the beaches of Mexico 400 years ago to impress upon his crewmen that they were in the New World to stand or die, the Republican candidate for president is gambling that America has had enough of the children's hour.

Somewhere there's a<BR>hero from Kansas
</FONT></center>

<BR><DD>Now that someone from Kansas has to stand up to the wizard behind the curtain, where's Dorothy?

<BR><DD>The wizard, without even popping a sweat, has sent the Republicans into a tailspin a lot like the crash of George Bush in 1992, when his eye-popping poll numbers fell from 92 percent in the wake of the war in the Gulf to 38 percent in the ruins of November.

<BR><DD>One loud &quot;boo!&quot; from the nation's most famous draft dodger and the entire regiment of Republicans, who only yesterday imagined they should be posing for recruiting posters, went flying for cover, crawling up under the nearest front porch to hide with the dogs. Bill Clinton, who's never met a woman he didn't run after or a man he didn't run from, was the most astonished pol in town.

<BR><DD>When the president found someone to throw the first punch at Newt Gingrich, he never imagined that nobody would strike back. When he found someone to throw the second punch, he never imagined that the Republicans themselves would join in piling on.

<BR><DD>The campaign to demonize the speaker was simple and brutish: Throw out lies and distortions and scream even louder when the Republicans fire back. The lies got louder, but the Republicans never fired back.

<BR><DD>The speaker's aims were not radical, unless most of us are radical: Cut down the size of government, shrink the budget on which big government feeds, crack down on criminals, throttle welfare cheaters, strengthen the military, roll back the regulatory bureaucracy, cut the throat of the trial-lawyer lobby before everyone but the lawyers are bankrupt, limit the terms of congressmen so they can return home to productive jobs, take the necessary steps to preserve the medical-care safety net - and cut taxes. Some radicalism.

<BR><DD>So radical, in fact, that President Clinton adopted most of these goals himself, beginning with his assertion that &quot;the era of big government is over.&quot; None of his own troops, liberals all, believe he really means it. Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, the Vietnam war hero whose contempt for the organizer of Vietnam anti-war rallies is obvious, calls him &quot;an unusually good liar,&quot; and in this case the president's big-government allies feel reassured.

<BR><DD>Some of the speaker's erstwhile allies, in the bravura of the morning after the November '94 blowout, likened their mighty victory to the D-Day landings at Normandy. The analogy, for a bunch of guys who mostly spent the Vietnam war at the Student Union, sounded a little far-fetched to some aging ears, but if some of these warriors had been barreling across France in the summer of '44 they would have braked cold on hearing Axis Sally's first diatribe against that ol' meanie Georgie Patton, and looked for a barn to hide in. Second Lt. Al D'Amato would have wanted the Germans to understand that he never really liked that Patton fella, anyway.

<BR><DD>Who can be surprised that the clouds of pink and baby blue floating over the White House are made of gauze and giddiness? Bill Clinton hasn't had a stroke of luck like the Republican collapse since Monroe Schwarzlose, a turkey farmer so obscure that even Mrs. Schwarzlose wasn't sure who he was, turned up as his only serious opponent in a Democratic gubernatorial primary back home. (Mr. Clinton won, but not by much.)

<BR><DD>The moral is that the Republicans can make a race of it in '96, too, if they can figure out which end of the gun you shoot with, and how to tell a foot from foe.

<BR><DD>For weeks everyone in Washington was trying to figure out whether Bob Dole was asleep, or merely dead, and now they're trying to figure out whether Al D'Amato is the hit man from Cleveland, dispatched by Mr. Dole, or whether he's just a slap-happy, showing off.

<BR><DD>What the Republicans seem to have lost sight of - and Bill Clinton hasn't - is that the conservative tide is still running, and gaining momentum. The great risk to Republican fortunes is that the voters will conclude that the Grand Old Partypoopers never had the convictions they seemed to have the courage of only a few months ago. Bill Clinton has no convictions, either, but he knows better than anyone else how to fake it.

<BR><DD>Mike McCurry, his press agent, remarked May 6 that the pendulum measuring the Clinton fortunes is groaning against the rope, close to reaching its apogee. Soon everything that has been breaking in the president's favor may begin breaking the other way.

<BR><DD>But maybe not. Iron laws govern politics, but not the iron laws of physics. The Republicans think they've got the character issue cold, and maybe they do, but in a street fight and a presidential campaign raw courage can count for more than character.

<BR><DD>The wizard, trembling behind the curtain, understood that. So did a little girl from Kansas.

The stern rebuke of<BR>a Sunday-school boy
</FONT></center>

<BR><DD>To everything a season, to quote the forbidden texts, and that includes even politics. If you wait long enough, the wheel comes 'round.

<BR><DD>Only nine presidential campaigns ago, the elites of media and academe were aghast at the redneck notion, propagated by the lesser fundamentalist tribes, that the pope and his Roman legions would impose the morality of a foreign church on America if Americans were foolish enough to elect John F. Kennedy.

<BR><DD>Voting for the Catholic candidate thus became something close to a civic duty for the enlightened American. The enlightened elites of course never imagined that anyone as smart and as attractive as a Kennedy actually believed any of that religious stuff, just as the enlightened elites never imagined that Martin Luther King and his fellow clergymen in the civil-rights movement were men of actual faith. In 1965, when I asked to interview Dr. King and said that I wanted to talk about faith as well as politics, he invited me to lunch in New York. &quot;I thought no one would ever ask,&quot; he told me, and a promised 30 minutes stretched into the mellow gloaming of late afternoon, long past the ham sandwiches at his desk, and we talked about how faith in Christ must guide every step in a believer's life.

<BR><DD>Ah, but now the enlightened elites are not so sure.

<BR><DD>Just when they thought the streets - or at least the power positions in the culture - were safe for atheists and pagans, witches and wizards and assorted lesser geeks, along comes something barbaric and grotesque like President Clinton's veto of the partial-birth abortion bill. Suddenly the priests and preachers and rabbis think they have something to say that the rest of us ought to hear.

<BR><DD>Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York, a Catholic and a Republican who usually supports secular Democratic positions (and whose efforts at raising well-behaved children have been mixed), was one of the first to tell Pope John Paul II to butt out of the moral argument. &quot;Such direct involvement in politics is not a good idea, because I think it confuses people.&quot;

<BR><DD>This is an odd view, that politicians and not priests should declaim on moral issues, and that when priests want to say something about moral issues they should be careful not to offend the politicians.

<BR><DD>The partial-birth abortion procedure is certainly a moral issue, though the Ministry of Euphemy has already decreed that it must be called &quot;intact dilation and evacuation,&quot; or &quot;late-term abortion,&quot; which is somewhat like calling the District of Columbia &quot;an interesting experiment in local government.&quot; But you may have noticed that the media have already taken the cue.

<BR><DD>This particular abortion, on a whole baby in the act of being born, is so gruesome, so cruel, so like something from the Manual of Procedure at Auschwitz, that the vicars of the Catholic Church, beginning with the vicar of Rome, have suspended their usual reticence at involving themselves in American electoral politics to tell Bill Clinton that he blundered in behalf of the forces of darkness.

<BR><DD>Cardinal John O'Connor of New York departed from his sermon during Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral to rebuke those who, like His Honor the mayor, denounced the pope for sticking his nose in what the mayor insists is only the business of politicians.

<BR><DD>Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston, appearing on the David Brinkley program, repeated for television what he had said earlier, that if a public official finds an irresolvable conflict between his conscience - the president has said that he personally finds this abortion procedure repugnant - and public service he should resign.

<BR><DD>&quot;I think that's rather straightforward,&quot; the cardinal said. &quot;It means what it says. I believe that an individual has an obligation to follow his or her own conscience, and I don't think any of us would want to be served by persons who don't do that.&quot;

<BR><DD>Well, of course no one could imagine that he had Bill Clinton in mind as a man conflicted by demands of duty and conscience, but it is curious that a pol as attuned to the political uses of public worship could have made such a miscalculation. Bill Clinton, after all, is the man who, after losing his first bid for re-election as governor of Arkansas, suddenly joined the largest Baptist church in Arkansas, which telecasts its Sunday morning services, and joined the choir on the assurance that he could sing from a position at the preacher's right hand, in full view of the camera at all times.

<BR><DD>Some cynical people have noted that now, since it has become clear that Baptists and other evangelicals aren't likely to do doodly-squat for him in November, he has abandoned his church for Hillary's Methodist congregation, one of the most liberal in town. This is, of course, merely another of those Arkansas coincidences.

<title>Rockwell: Bad Law Bites Back -- 12/3/96</title>

<h2>Bad Law Bites Back  </h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>
<P>
<BR> 
The &quot;Contract with America,&quot; reflexively denounced
by leftliberals, was never as good as its bad reputation. It posed
as big government's tormentor, but on close analysis proved to
be more gimmick than gauntlet. It even included some planks that
increased the power of the central state.
<P>
One item in particular did positive harm. This was the Congressional
Accountability Act, passed in the first days of the last &quot;revolutionary&quot;
Congress. Its point was to apply the government's health and labor
laws to Congress, thereby ending its previous, and presumably
hypocritical, exemption. Hardly anyone stopped to ask: was there
a reason for exempting Congress in the first place? 
<P>
Congress is beginning to find out. If labor laws apply to
Congress, its employees can use the courts to demand quotas, form
unions, threaten strikes, and generally cause trouble. And who
enforces all these laws? Bureaucrats in the executive branch.
That gives the Clinton administrationor whoever happens to be
in chargedirect control of Congressional offices.  
<P>
In the American constitutional tradition, Congress is <I>supposed</I>
to be exempt from any laws enforced by the executive. Remember
the doctrine of the separation of powers that used to be taught
in highschool civics? Congress supervises the executive, not the
reverse. Any other system invites abuse of power, corruption,
and intimidation of the elected officials closest to the people.
<P>
Let's say some lawmaker wants to cut the budget of the Labor
Department, and has a good chance of succeeding. Well, maybe the
Secretary of Labor might get interested in whether this lawmaker
is obeying all the laws on overtime pay or racial nondiscrimination.
Just the accusation would cause harm.  
<P>
To avoid that kind of intimidation, lawmakers might decide
they have better things to do than attack the agencies with new
legal power over them. That takes the heat off the home of big
governmentthe executiveand puts it on the Congress, the branch
charged with overseeing the spending of our tax dollars. 
<P>
The proponents of the Accountability Act argued that if Congress
is going to impose lawslike racial quotas or the minimum wageon
the private sector, the least it can do is obey these laws themselves.

<P>
For starters, not all legislators vote for every law. Why
should a majority of lawmakers be able to impose laws, enforced
by the president, on a minority of lawmakers? Even if a law passes
unanimously in one Congress, why should a future Congress be bound
by it? Congressmen should have sovereign immunity from all these
laws, even when they are passed by the Congress itself. 
<P>
A case now before Congress illustrates the point. Members
of the U.S. Capitol Police, a Congressional institution, want
to form a union, an action made possible only by the police applying
the executivedepartment labor code to themselves. In response,
the Republicans have done the right thing: sued to prevent it
from happening.
<P>
As the Republicans arguethough not for the recordunionization
introduces all sorts of complications. Unionized cops can, for
example, engage in work slowdowns and expel conservative, antiunion
police. Moreover, unions are heavily political organizations,
backing Democrats in all national elections.
<P>
If this suit succeedsand it probably will notit would gut
the Congressional Accountability Act, which would be great. But
by attempting to prevent unionization, the 105th Congress puts
itself in the ironic position of trying to repeal one of the most
heralded, if wrongheaded, achievements of the 104th.
<P>
When imposed against private companies, U.S. health, safety,
and labor laws cost hundreds of billions in lost productivity
every year. They are a major source of the secular decline in
American business vibrancy. Why did Congress, which should be
trying to repeal these laws, instead expand them?
<P>
When confronted with this point, some people argue that the
real purpose is to make Congressmen &quot;feel&quot; the laws
they have imposed on the American people and thereby encourage
them to work towards cutting red tape. But this too is a flight
of fancy. The authors of the Contract believe in these laws for
the private sector, and meanwhile, good lawmakers face witch-hunts
by the regime they are supposed to be battling. 
<P>
 Congress is right in suing to stop a police union. But it
should also admit it made a mistake in imposing this law on itself,
repeal the darn thing, and then repeal the oppressive regulations
that make life a living heck for American business.
<P>

<title>December 2, 1996--Murder by Air Bag</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>
<I>December 2, 1996</I><p>
<h2>Murder by Air Bag</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>
<P>
<BR>
Can we trust government to regulate business? For an answer, take
a look at the great airbag fiasco. Five years ago, the government
mandated that air bags be installed in cars. In an instance of
death by government, these bags kill people involved in fender
benders. 
<P>
Turns out, the car makers were right about the dangers all along.
But they were browbeaten and overruled by the usual cabal of anticapitalist
militants, Congressional liberals, and regulatory bureaucrats.
Let's review the history. 
<P>
Ralph Nader and his political network never stopped trying to
replicate the successful smear of the Corvair, as found in his
famous fairy tale, <I>Unsafe at Any Speed</I>. In the seventies,
they dreamed up a new way to attack the car industry, by now vulnerable
to media assaults. 
<P>
Here's what Nader and the gang came up with. Hear ye, hear ye:
there's a technology that would massively cut automobile deaths.
It is a pillow that pops out of the steering wheel in an collision.
Yes, it's even better than the seatbelt.
<P>
So why aren't these magic pillows available on cars? Why, indeed,
aren't they mandatory? In a word: Greed, said Nader and Co. The
car makers could be spending money to save your life. Instead
they are lining their pockets with profits from unsafe vehicles.
<P>
Thus did the air bag become the leftwing craze of the Carter years.
Typically, the product and the mythology surrounding it embodied
socialist paranoia. In this view, the capitalist is secretly killing
the consumer while the average man is too stupid to know about
it, which is why we need the government to intervene.  
<P>
But if air bags were a valuable product worth the expense, car
companies would have installed them while Nader was in law school,
if only to gain an advantage over the competition. 
<P>
None of the Naderite nonsense was convincing to people who knew
something about markets. But the media laughed at company warnings:
that, first, air bags were not cost efficient (yes, you can put
a price tag on safety; we could all drive around in tanks, after
all). Second, air bags would make people think they could get
by without a seatbelt, thus increasing injury. 
<P>
Third, that air bags are not soft and fluffy at all, but can hit
your forehead like a 200 mph brick wall. You might have all your
limbs after a crash, but you might also be dead. The companies
warned that children and small women were particularly at risk.
<P>
But the crash dummies favored by the consumer groups didn't test
for this factor, and, anyway, the well had been poisoned. The
media dismissed company complaints as more evidence of the capitalist
conspiracy to make people drive dangerous cars.
<P>
The government prevailed against the car companies, and the airbag
mandate went into effect. Everyone cheered Ralph and booed Detroit.
But the bags added billions to the cost of cars, led Americans
to drive more recklessly, and directly killed some fifty people
in just the last three years, including the infant who was decapitated
by an air bag in Idaho.
<P>
Haven't they also saved 1,500 lives? That's the claim, but there's
no way to know. It's easy for the airbag lobby to play fast and
loose with these hypotheticals.
<P>
Plus, it's one thing to have a loved one die in a tragic traffic
fluke; it's quite another to have him killed by a government mandate.
It's the difference between falling and being shoved off a ledge.

<P>
To correct the problem, the government is considering a number
of options. One is to allow people to have their air bags disconnected
by car dealerships. That's right: they can't do that legally now.
<P>
Another is to mandate a huge warning sign on the dashboard: WARNING!
DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY CAN OCCUR. Thanks a lot. Another is to
mandate a &quot;smart&quot; bag that will supposedly adjust to
your height and weight so it won't kill you. Still another would
order you to keep your baby in the back seat (as if a single parent
could take a long commute that way).
<P>
Mandate, mandate, mandate, that's all the government can talk
about. Instead, those behind this mess should be offering public
apologies and then forced to pay compensation to the families
who've had their mothers and children murdered by air bags, to
the car buyers who've had their prices artificially increased,
and to the car companies that have been vilified and harassed.
<P>
Even if the government won't draw the right lesson from this fiasco,
we should. Don't trust the feds with your safety. Trust those
in private enterprise, who have the best interests of the consumer
in mind. They won't kill you and then lie about it. 
<P>

<BR> 




In the 1950s and following, when full-blown socialism began to lose 
its intellectual credibility, there arose a theory of the "mixed 
economy." The idea was that the best of socialism and capitalism can 
be combined into a new system that curbs the excesses of both. The 
result was the political economy of contradiction: "market socialism," 
"collective entrepreneurship," and "community investment," among many 
other strange hybrids. <p>

The theory of the mixed economy didn't get very far, no doubt because 
of its confused and conflicting character. Property is either private 
or it isn't. Prices either float freely or they don't. Investment is 
either market-driven or it's not. One system must dominate the other, 
in the same way that cars must drive on the left- or the right-hand 
side of the road. <p>

The idea of the mixed economy may have fizzled among American liberals 
(though academic publishers are still enthralled with the idea). In 
the Republican Party, however, the idea is making a huge comeback. The 
party is not backing the old mix of socialism and capitalism or 
anything as systematic as that; it is backing the political economy of 
polar opposites.<p>

No where is this more evident than in the Republican treatment of the 
budget. With Jack Kemp on the ticket, supply sideism has again become 
the dominant fiscal ideology. There's nothing wrong with the idea that 
tax cuts fuel economic growth. The American people are overtaxed, and 
only an all-out statist would deny it. The problem is the belief that 
government spending can go up forever without someone, sometime, 
having to pay for it. <p>

The Republican plan has not spelled out any spending cuts because Jack 
Kemp doesn't believe they're necessary (as he demonstrated during his 
free-spending HUD years). He's got a long history of excoriating 
people to his right who have the courage to call for cuts in Social 
Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and welfare generally. He never misses 
the chance to underscore the ticket's desire to keep the social 
"safety net" exactly the way it is, or even expand it. <p>

In some areas, Republicans are pushing for huge spending increases. 
For example, they say that the Clinton administration has cut the 
military budget too far too fast, and that they will reverse course 
with tens of billions in new spending. And they are promoting the 
hare-brained idea that taxpayers should foot the private-school bills 
of any kid who is dissatisfied with public school. <p>

At the same time, tax cuts have become the centerpiece of the 
campaign. They are promising a three-year 15 percent cut in income tax 
rates, a per child tax rebate, and a 50 percent capital gains tax cut. 
That's laudable, though the full program--even if it passes--won't 
begin to reverse the tax increases Robert Dole has engineered during 
his 35 years in office. <p>

For once, liberals are asking the right question: where in tax-cut 
land is the money going to come from to supply new guns to the 
Pentagon, and a $2000 annual voucher to every "poor" child in America? 
The candidates won't say, except to suggest that this contradiction 
will be solved through the mysterious magic of "economic growth." 
Private enterprise can be enlisted, unwittingly, to pay for ever-
higher public spending. <p>

The ticket compounds the error by suggesting it will "end the IRS as 
we know it," a phrase designed to lead voters to believe they will no 
longer have to answer to the tax police. Here again, the idea is a 
fine one. But to make it a reality, government must dramatically curb 
its appetite for spending. Without such curbs, the promise to stop 
collecting taxes, or make paying them less onerous, is deeply 
deceptive.  <p>

There is such a thing as the bottom line. Every dime in new public 
spending must be extracted from private markets, either through 
stepped-up use of the taxing power or more borrowing, or by calling on 
the Federal Reserve to monetize the debt by printing money. All three 
have a destabilizing effect on the financial markets at some point. 
There's no such thing as having your cake and eating it too. <p>

The same contradictions spoil the Republican monetary policy. Jack 
Kemp has long advocated a gold standard (or, more strictly, a gold 
price rule for monetary management). But the chief benefit of the gold 
standard is that it puts shackles on the ability of government to 
borrow and monetize debt. You can always print paper money (which is 
why politicians like our present money system), but gold has a fixed 
supply (alchemy being the stuff of legend). <p>

At the same time, Kemp evangelizes for giving the poor more "access to 
credit." He endorses the dangerous movement to force banks to lend 
money to borrowers on grounds of their lowly economic status, without 
regard to whether the loans will be paid back on time or ever. This 
policy requires the kind of loose money regime absolutely prohibited 
by the gold standard. You can't expect to gain the benefits of a gold 
standard unless you're willing to accept its discipline. <p>

The same mixed-up approach is evident in their statements about 
regulation. Dole and Kemp employ the rhetoric of deregulation and call 
for the government to stop muscling private enterprise. At the same 
time, just prior to the convention, Dole told a group of disability 
activists that he is going to expand enforcement of his pet Americans 
With Disabilities Act.<p>

Yet the ADA--which calls on all public and private entities  to make 
accommodation for every conceivable disability, physical or mental--is 
surpassed only by the Clean Air Act in the costs and burdens it places 
on business. According to the letter of the law and court precedent, 
practically every business and public facility is in violation right 
now. For that reason, the ADA has become the latest get-rich-quick 
scheme for the litigious overclass of trial lawyers. <p>

So it goes for the freedom of association. The ticket has strongly 
implied it will retain the laws imposing affirmative action; indeed 
Kemp has been a rabid advocate of these policies. At the same time, 
the Republicans want to be seen as opposing "quotas," the logical and 
necessary outcome of anti-discrimination laws empowering the 
government with defining what constitutes illegal preference in the 
workforce. <p>

On and on it goes with welfare spending (they promise both a 
guaranteed national income and policies to force people to work), 
education (they promise to abolish the Department of Education and to 
have it administer a federal voucher program), immigration (they 
promise to end the free ride and give immigrants full rights to 
welfare), and trade (it is supposed to be both "free" and "fair," i.e. 
restrictive).  <p>

The final and most brazen contradiction has been the Republican 
Achilles heel for at least three decades. They promise smaller 
government at home while insisting that the U.S. step up its empire of 
foreign aid, foreign troops, and foreign wars. This is the most deeply 
dishonest of all the clashing positions within the Republican grab 
bag. A government big enough to run a global empire will hardly shrink 
from total social management at home. <p>

Philosophers speak of antinomies: contradictory truths that may not 
negate each other. Unfortunately for Republicans, these do not exist 
in economic policy. The mixed economy of Robert Dole and Jack Kemp is 
just as mixed-up as the attempt to blend socialism and capitalism. 
Reality eventually forces the politicians who try it to choose one 
path or the other. <p>

<title>Rockwell: Conservatives and Vouchers -- 7/22/96</title>

<h2>
Conservatives and Vouchers</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>

<P>

  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Seeking to align himself more closely with conservatives 
before the Republican convention, Bob Dole has endorsed a federal 
school voucher program. But if he had done his homework, he would 
have known that conservatives have grave reservations about 
putting private schools on the dole. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Mr. Dole's idea is a four-year pilot program that would cost 
$5 billion, with half the bill paid by the federal government 
providing the states foot the rest. Four million students from 
mostly poor families would get grants to attend private schools.
This is "a civil rights movement for the 1990s," he said. Is it? 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For decades, conservatives have debated with liberals on 
education. Liberals say money needs to be redistributed from rich 
districts to poor ones, and overall spending increased 
dramatically. Bosh, say conservatives. The answer lies with local 
control, returning to basics, and rewarding achievement. Throwing 
more money at the problem--especially federal money--will not 
work. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To which side of the debate does the voucher idea belong? 
Vouchers means new federal spending in a new federal education 
program that violates the 10th amendment. Vouchers guarantee 
perpetually higher budgets for the Department of Education, which 
will distribute them. Vouchers get the feds involved in the 
funding and running of private schools, something not even Mr. 
Clinton's Goals 2000 does. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Even Mr. Dole's pitch is strangely class-based: we should 
take from the rich, who send their kids to private schools 
because "they have the money," and give to the poor, so they can 
have "choice" too. The implication is that disparities in wealth 
are inherently unjust; it takes subsidies to make people truly 
free. Only the far-left used to talk like this. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Of course rich people have more "choice" than poor people, 
and not only in the schools they attend. Rich people can live in 
nicer homes, drive nicer cars, dress better, eat fancier food, if 
they so choose. Mr. Dole says "that's not the way it ought to 
work in America." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Oh? There's a name for the system that allows such 
disparities: it's capitalism. Those who work hard, save, and 
invest benefit materially, as they should. And by spending their 
own dollars on private school, people are investing in the future 
of their children. How strange that Mr. Dole would be the one to 
offer such a radical critique of this system. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What's brand new in Mr. Dole's plan is that vouchers would 
also be given to home schoolers. That's a sure path to disaster. 
The feds would not only monitor and license these caring 
mothers--the way social workers do welfare recipients--but also 
determine what and how many hours they teach. Goodbye 
homeschooling. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Already Americans are taxed to the hilt to pay for failing 
public schools. Already states are strapped by intrusive federal 
regulations that have transformed many schools into condom-
distributing, multicultural petri dishes. Now, Republicans are 
supposed to get behind a program that will do to private schools 
what the feds have done to public ones? 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It's safe to say that Mr. Dole's idea won't go far. Of course 
teachers unions oppose vouchers. But so does an organized 
movement of religious and economic conservatives in the 
Republican Party.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
George Roche of Hillsdale College says vouchers would remake 
private schools "into the image of the very public schools that 
have failed so miserably." Ronald Trowbridge adds that "if 
government vouchers are extended to private primary and secondary 
schools," private schools "will become virtually extinct." 
Columnist Samuel Francis says that if vouchers pass, the nation's 
"private and parochial schools would soon be homogenized by the 
same government that has already ruined public schools."
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Looking at the budget figures, Charlotte Allen, writing in 
the American Spectator, is shocked by the sheer cost. Taxpayers 
will "find themselves obliged to pay for a private-school system 
on top of a public-school system." Worst of all, they will "leave 
us even more in thrall to a powerful central government."
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Pat Buchanan, who once backed them, says he took "a hard 
second look at those school vouchers." Now he predicts they will 
"entail greater state contamination and control." Why not "give 
the billions back to taxpayers" in tax cuts, he asks? 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Economist Murray Rothbard was once asked what he proposed in 
place of vouchers. Abolish the Department of Education, he said, 
repeal regulations on private schools, cut public school budgets, 
and insure local control. Finally, Dr. Rothbard said, the best 
voucher is a person's own hard-earned dollar; government should 
let us keep what we earn. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Instead, Mr. Dole has proposed yet another far-flung federal 
program. On this issue, as with many others, he has abandoned the 
true conservative position, and thrown in his lot with the 
big-spending, egalitarian left.

<title>Rockwell: Alienation in American Politics -- 7/8/96</title>

<h2>
Alienation in American Politics 
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>

<P>

  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Marxists used to talk about the "alienation" of workers 
exploited by wage slavery. Someday, they predicted, the system 
would come unglued, and the workers would expropriate the 
expropriators. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It's a bunch of malarkey, to be sure; no system is as 
exploitative as socialism. Yet alienation does exist: it's what 
average citizens feel towards the political process and the 
massive federal government it sustains. Every day we are 
exploited more and more, and yet seem powerless to change 
anything. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Consider the recent example of VMI and the Citadel, proud 
and ancient institutions steeped in the respective histories of 
their states. As single-sex military academies, they offered 
young men the camaraderie only this setting can provide. Then, 
for no good reason, a majority of the Supreme Court decided it 
didn't like these schools. In one fell stroke, they are 
destroyed. It's the kind of action that alienates citizens from 
their government. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Another example involves Stalinesque demographic planning. 
Federal judges in Baltimore, Maryland, and Dallas, Texas, have 
decided that inner-city public housing residents should be living 
in the suburbs, again, for no good reason. By court order, these 
residents will be dispersed according to a government plan and at 
taxpayer expense. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This is wildly unpopular, both among those who pay to live 
in nice areas and among public-housing residents. When a similar 
scheme was tried in Chicago, it led to enormous social upheaval, 
huge population shifts, and the wrecking of formerly decent 
neighborhoods. No doubt, if the judicial dictators get their way, 
the same will happen in Baltimore and Dallas. Yet exploited 
citizens are powerless to stop these schemes. No wonder they feel 
so alienated from the government. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Another example was brought home by the bombing in Saudi 
Arabia. How many people knew the U.S. stationed thousands of 
troops at the King Abdul Aziz air base in Dhahran? Of those, how 
many think the U.S. has a vital interest in continuing to do so? 
Yet when 19 Americans were killed, the obvious solution--bring 
the troops home--escaped everyone in Washington. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The bloated military budget and the foreign policy it 
supports have virtually nothing to do with the average citizen. 
Only the traditional beneficiaries of imperialism gain: 
politicians, corporate exporters, military contractors, lifetime 
bureaucrats, and spooks. The long-suffering taxpayer is alienated 
from the whole system, yet powerless to change it. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The examples provided by the last few years could be 
multiplied without end. Clintonian tax increase, Nafta, Gatt, the 
Mexican bailout, welfare for immigrants: all are projects of federal 
government, all were fantastically unpopular, yet all were 
steamrollered through anyway. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Marxists used to talk about the "power elite"--the 
wealthy and unaccountable capitalists who oppress the workers. 
Who today denies that American politics is in fact dominated by a 
power elite? This class is not made of capitalists, who make 
their living, after all, by serving the consuming public. It 
consists of employees and hangers-on of the federal government 
itself. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Alienation is fueled by the obvious reality that the power 
elite does not have independent means of support. The huge public 
treasury they have at their disposal is transferred directly from 
the paychecks of the working class. This creates a permanent 
state of conflict, and deepening political discontent unlike any 
we've seen. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Some people drop out of politics altogether, and turn 
towards radical groups with a leftist or rightist bent. Those 
still active seek other outlets, including third parties. Most
Americans think two parties are not enough. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What else can we expect when the nominees of the major 
parties are such open representatives of the ruling class? But if 
Watergate undermined faith in the presidency and in government 
generally, what will the newest unflattering revelations about 
Bill Clinton do? They can only increase alienation and 
discontent, and cast a permanent pall on the Beltway elite. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The elite may bemoan this fact, but the rise of intense 
anti-government feeling is the most encouraging development in 
modern political life. Jefferson and Madison said a free people 
should never have confidence in men with power. The bigger the 
government, the less it should be trusted, and the less it's 
trusted, the more likely it is to fall. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In Marxist lore, history would settle all scores in favor of 
socialism. But the opposite is happening, and, because the system 
cannot hold, time is running out for leviathan. The expropriated 
taxpayers will have their day, the troops will come home, the 
central planning will end, and the dictatorship of the power 
elite will be no more. Then we will understand the one truth in 
Marxism: the state can wither away.

<title>Rockwell: Clinton's Libertarian Cloak -- 7/3/96</title>
</head>

<h2>
Clinton's Libertarian Cloak 
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>

<P>

  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It's a crazy, mixed-up political world when Bill Clinton 
comes out for individualist libertarianism. The trend began in 
his state of the union address when he announced that "the era of 
big government is over"--and then proposed half a dozen new 
government programs. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But that statement was merely a coming attraction. During a 
press grilling on the FBI files controversy, Mr. Clinton said he 
is "appalled" by "any kind of abuse of public authority that 
tramples on the liberties of individual citizens." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
He's gone beyond stealing Republican issues. Now he's 
remaking himself in the image of Patrick Henry and Thomas Paine. 
Moreover, he says, this is not a new position, but one held "from 
my earliest days as a young man."
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Mr. Clinton's new-found libertarianism does have one 
advantage. He has committed himself to a philosophical standard 
by which he can be judged. Do his policies measure up? 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The White House wants to outlaw work that pays under $5 an 
hour. But what if a person can't find a job that pays that much? 
If he works for less, he and his employer violate federal law. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Here's a clear case of public authority trampling on the 
liberties of individual citizens. If a person works for two bucks 
an hour, and the deal is by mutual agreement, there's no harm 
done. But when the government steps in to prevent the 
transaction, it robs both parties of the liberty to contract. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Similar examples can be found on every page of the U.S. 
Code. Why should the government drive a wedge between consumers 
who want to buy cigarettes and companies that want to sell them? 
Why should the government force employers to hire people who 
aren't right for the job?
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Why should the government stop importers from selling Iraqi 
oil? Why should the government prevent property owners from 
draining their swamps and developing their land? Why should the 
government tax away up to 40 percent of people's incomes, and 
declare some to be "unearned"? All these actions trample on 
liberty. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Is it unfair to discuss economic policies when Mr. Clinton 
was talking about the "civil liberty" not to be spied on by 
federal police agents without cause? No, although left-liberals 
have long tried to have it both ways, dreaming of socialist 
economics and strict enforcement of the Bill of Rights. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Despite the ACLU, it's impossible to separate the different 
aspects of liberty. A government that forbids and controls 
economic exchange will think nothing of invading what are 
designated as "civil liberties." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There might have been a time when left-liberals believed in 
free association and other civil liberties. They are still fuming 
because Senator Joseph McCarthy thought it mattered when a public 
figure in Hollywood or the State Department was a member of the 
Communist Party. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But those days are long gone. Today, the left is far more 
hysterical about private militias than Mr. McCarthy ever was 
about communists. Freedom of association? Any gun owner who gets 
together with a few friends to fret about the feds is to be spied 
on and treated as a potential bomb builder or church burner. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Liberals are still shrieking about J. Edgar Hoover's 
investigations of the civil rights movement. But today, left-wing 
nonprofit groups spy on people's political affiliations and share 
their files with happy federal bureaucrats. No anti-communist 
group of the 1950s painted with the broad brush of the 
"anti-hate" blocs of the 1990s, which link the desire for tax 
cuts or less recycling with every manner of terrorist activity. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The left loved the Bill of Rights when it was used by the 
federal government against the states. With the independence of 
the states demolished, the left thinks nothing of openly 
attacking the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 9th, and 10th amendments. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
If Bill Clinton's devotion to libertarian doctrine is 
laughable, so is the left's claim to defend individuals against 
the government. These are the people who have created the 
Orwellian state they warned us against, and--among a host of 
other depredations--turned private comments into punishable 
speech crimes. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Mr. Clinton's libertarian sentiments were provoked by the 
accusations that he used FBI files for political purpose. We'll 
know he's serious when he proposes to burn--not the files on 
political appointees--but the millions of dossiers on law-abiding 
private citizens. Until that great day, the big government whose 
era he claims has ended, will still be lording it over us.

<h2>
The Politics of Church Fires
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>

<P>

  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The 1988 Willie Horton ads were considered awful because 
they played on fears of race and crime for base (that is, 
Republican) motives. Fast forward eight years, and consider the 
uses to which the Democrats are putting the church burnings in 
the South.
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
These fires are invariably described as part of a "wave" or 
"rash" of attacks against blacks not seen since Jim Crow. Even 
though almost all are unsolved, the Clinton Justice Department 
assures us that whites are the perpetrators and racial hatred the 
cause. Therefore, these are not mere arsons, but big-league 
political crimes. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Meanwhile, more than 200 federal agents are crawling around 
the rural South, usurping local and state fire investigators, and 
the South-bashing New York Times has had a field day, running 
treatises on why this is exactly what one would expect from a 
racist region. We should all look to New York City, locus of 
peace, harmony, and intergroup love. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A gaggle of left-wing organizations, led by specialists in 
racial agitation, has declared the burnings to be part of a 
conspiracy tacitly encouraged by the Republican Congress and the 
Supreme Court's rulings against racially drawn voting districts.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Jesse Jackson takes it a step further. The burnings are part 
of a new "anti-black mania," he says, a "white riot" spread by 
"lawmakers." People in white sheets burn churches, but so do 
Congressmen "in blue suits, who use thinly coated, veiled race 
signals when they say welfare and crime and three strikes and end 
affirmative action." Mr. Jackson urges people to register and 
vote for you-know-what party.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As for the victimized pastors themselves, they went on 
television to complain that they and their parishioners had been 
questioned, even though it's standard procedure to look to owners 
first when a building is torched. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
All this is but a side show to the central message as stated 
by Bill Clinton. Standing outside a black church in South 
Carolina, he denounced burnings, poverty, and discrimination, and 
proclaimed the glories of civil rights. "We are not going back," 
he said. "We are not slipping back to those dark days." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In case you missed it, there's a political agenda here: any 
attempt to repeal quotas or welfare is, like torching a church, 
motivated by hatred. This is how liberal politicians play on 
racial fears and crime for their political purposes. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Mr. Clinton has already been caught in one fib. He said he 
had "vivid and painful memories of black churches being burned in 
my own state when I was a child." It turns out that there is no 
record of such burnings. His remarks had to be corrected by a 
spokesman. They weren't churches, but "community buildings." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Joyce Price and Warren Strobel of the Washington Times
talked to NAACP officials, black pastors, and historians in 
Arkansas. But only one expert could remember a suspicious fire in 
the 1950s that involved a racial element. Curtis Sykes, chairman 
of Arkansas's Black History Advisory Committee, said the fire was 
set by a black man, who was convicted of several insurance-fraud 
arsons. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Frank Wolfe of the Arkansas-Democrat Gazette said that Mr. 
Clinton might be remembering the bombings in Little Rock on Labor 
Day 1959, resulting from resentments over forced school 
integration. Trouble is: all the targets were white, including 
public officials, lawyers, and firemen who had turned their hoses
on protesting white parents. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Fibs aside, the campaign marches on. Always anxious to find 
evil in Alabama, the media have focussed on our four fires since 
December. But Alvin Benn of the Montgomery Advertiser raises 
serious questions. Since 1990, thirty-eight houses of worship 
have burned in Alabama. Twenty were black; eighteen were white, 
although there has been no publicity about them. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
And none of the fires apparently involved "hate," says the 
State Fire Marshal. For example, some burglars set fire to 
churches after robbing them. Other cases involved internal church 
disputes, drunks who decided to burn a building, insurance fraud, 
electrical fires, and lightning. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
More interesting data: thirty church burnings in the South 
over eighteen months may sound like a lot, and it is obviously 
thirty too many, but it represents 0.03 percent of the arsons 
recorded. In just 1994, Chicago had more than 1,000; Los Angeles 
more than 3,000; and New York City more than 5,000. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The church fires may "harken back to a dark era," as Mr. 
Clinton claims. But his efforts certainly harken back to other 
fear-based campaigns to get out the vote, while chilling anyone 
who would question statist federal policies and the racial 
orthodoxies used to justify them.

<title>Rockwell:  The Terror Threat? -- 6/5/96</title>

<h2>
The Terror Threat?
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>

<P>

  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Whip yourself into a frenzy. Dig a shelter out back. Fly 
into a panic and be extremely scared. It's time for special 
alarms, drills, and teach-ins. Most of all, pay your taxes with 
diligence and joy so the government can protect you.
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The big news? The feds say terrorists are loose on the land. 
And you could be their next victim. The only way to safety is to 
surrender your money, your freedom, and your guns to the 
bureaucrats, and quake with fear unless the FBI is near. At least 
that's what we'd do if we believed everything we're being told. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Ever since the Oklahoma bombing, we've heard that the threat 
of domestic terrorism means the government needs vast new power 
and money. Every chance they get, officials from virtually every 
federal police agency--the FBI, FEMA, Justice, the CIA--tell the 
press that a bomb could blow up your neighborhood any minute. 
Look out! 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
And that's only the beginning. Why, do you realize that 
someone could use chemical weapons against your hometown? Even 
more frightening is the supposed prospect of biological warfare. 
If something isn't done right away, we'll be infected with a 
deadly disease or writhe on the floor, dying from asphyxiation. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"The likelihood that state or nonstate actors," says head 
spook John M. Deutch in his best bureaucratise, "will attempt to 
use weapons of mass destruction against U.S. interests is 
growing." But, never fear, the feds are here to protect you, 
just as they protected so many in the past. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Last November, for example, FEMA hosted a creepy gathering 
in Mount Weather, Virginia, attended by the CIA, the FBI, and 
various other spies and paranoids prominent in the D.C. political 
racket. They met in a huge bomb shelter built at the height of 
the Cold War to maintain life and luxury for government officials 
as the civilian population suffered nuclear annihilation.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
At this meeting, according to the Wall Street Journal, the 
geniuses in government met to fret about how little money is 
being spent to prepare for terrorist attacks. But "some serious 
planning has begun," says the Journal. Oh to be a fly on that 
wall. Who can doubt that these people salivate over the prospect 
of martial law, suspending the Constitution, and shoving the 
population around like cattle?  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What will the ruling regime do to maintain its power in the 
post-Cold War environment? Well, there is the terrorism bill 
passed by Congress and signed by the president. It bolstered 
federal police power with new funds and responsibilities, and 
restricted the rights of American citizens. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Funny that the framers of the Constitution never anticipated 
the need for an internal police force to keep the people in check 
and protected. If they had, they might have given up those silly ideas 
about liberty and self government. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Going on seven years now, the ruling elites have confronted 
a serious problem. With no credible foreign threat on the 
horizon, the central state seems to have lost its primary reason 
for existence. The average fellow can't understand what the 
apparatus in Washington does with 1.7 trillion bucks every year. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A government this big does its best to avoid peace at home 
and abroad. As it knows from experience, these are the times that 
try men's pocketbooks. People demand lower taxes, shrinking 
government power, and less government arrogance. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For instance: during the first World War, the government 
practically established martial law at home, planned most 
industrial and agricultural production, revved up the military 
machine to full capacity, and squelched free speech and a free 
press. It was a sad chapter, but one that came to a quick close 
when the war was over. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For the American people demanded an immediate end to the 
violation of their rights and the high taxation of their 
property. The military shrunk in size, and the war planning 
boards were shut down, not to be reopened until the New Deal 
(under the auspices of curing an economic crisis, itself brought 
on by the Federal Reserve). 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The same thing might have happened after the Second World 
War, which also saw an explosion in government power over the 
economy. But just as people were demanding a return to normalcy, 
the Cold War intervened, and thankfully so for folks in 
Washington. The communists were coming, and taxpayers could be 
relied up on to stay frightened and relatively docile for another 
forty years. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Fast forward to 1989, and the end of the ramshackle Soviet 
empire. With no substantial foreign policy threats on the 
horizon, peace and freedom threatened to break out yet again. A 
series of botched military exercises overseas has made the public 
ever more skeptical of the ruling regime. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Terrorism is as good an excuse as any for keeping people 
alarmed about some enemy, and to deflect attention away from the 
real threat to their liberties, which is the government itself. 
Indeed, for several years, polls have recorded record-level 
dissatisfaction with government. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Washington is none too happy that nobody seems to care about 
the supposed terrorist threat. Complains Senator Dick Lugar, 
"there is almost a sense of denial out there in the public." 
Indeed a recent poll--which underscores that the public is 
keeping its wits--reveals that only a few Americans are 
"seriously worried" about terrorism. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The government is trying to fix that. Some militia guys were 
recently arrested in Georgia, and the anonymous federal informant 
who had undoubtedly egged them on told the press they planning to bomb 
the Olympics. Not true, said the on-the-record briefing that followed, 
but the essential message had already been planted in the minds of 
many.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
And last year, the feds called the Anaheim, California, fire 
department to say that Disneyland would be sprayed with poison 
gas in three hours. Whoops, they said later, it's not true. But 
again, the essential message had been planted. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
From the beginning of time, governments have used the 
prospect of attack, real and phony baloney, to inspire citizen 
compliance. Will it work this time?
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
I have my doubts. A government that can't deliver the mail
surely can't stop poison gas attacks. And the American people 
have become stingy with their rights and liberties, as they 
should be and will ever be, now that government has become the 
"fearful master" George Washington warned us against.

<title>Rockwell:  Revenue Neutrality   -- 5/9/96</title>

<h2>
Revenue Neutrality  
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>

<P>

  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Republicans might as well pack their bags, admit defeat,  
and head home. Their entire program has been doomed by the  
doctrine of "revenue neutrality." In practice, it means that the  
government's income can never fall. This has turned fiscal policy  
into, at best, a pointless exercise; at worst, a deeply dishonest  
shell game.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Look at recent Republican maneuvers. Every proposed lower  
tax is matched by some increase. Give a tax credit for adoption,  
and raise taxes on business. Cut gas taxes, and increase other  
excise taxes. What's next? Cuts in the inheritance tax, "paid  
for" by an increase in the gas tax? Maybe the per child tax  
credit can be "paid for" by repealing the adoption tax credit.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The total burden of taxes remains the same no matter what  
these guys do. So what is supposed to be the purpose of this  
nonsense? If it is too much to ask that the federal government  
take less from the private sector, Republican slogans about  
cutting the size of government are empty. There's no point to  
elections, platforms, or debates, because you can't cut  
government without cutting its income.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The doctrine of "revenue neutrality" is a leftover from  
George Bush's 1990 budget agreement, which raised taxes and  
arguably lost him the election. Part of the deal was that any  
increase in spending must be accompanied by an increase in taxes;  
likewise, any decrease in taxes must be matched by an equal  
decrease in spending.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
At first, it sounds reasonable to treat the federal budget  
as if it were a household's. But it's not, because it doesn't  
consist of owned property. It is a vast redistribution scheme  
whereby property is pilfered from some and doled out to others;  
either or both practices should be curbed wherever possible.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Before the 1990 budget deal, no one said that all tax cuts  
had to be "paid for" in other ways. That language makes it seem  
deeply expensive to cut revenue, and thus fiscally irresponsible.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For taxpayers, however, a tax cut is not an expense, but a  
boon. It allows them to keep more of what is rightfully theirs in  
the first place. What's expensive is keeping taxpayers on the  
hook for the same percentage of the national income, year after  
year, and never allowing it to fall.   
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
One fallacious assumption behind the doctrine of revenue  
neutrality is that Congress can know exactly what people will do  
before and after tax changes. Consider the gas tax. It's possible  
that deep cuts in the gas tax would cause the price to fall and  
the demand to rise, thus increasing overall revenue. But Congress  
doesn't even consider the prospect. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This is true for many taxes. If the inheritance tax were cut  
dramatically, people's incentive to accumulate property would  
increase dramatically. It's even possible that the resulting  
economic activity would offset the revenue losses of the tax cut.  
So it goes for the income tax and every other excise tax.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But let's say the so-called Laffer Effect didn't kick in,  
and total revenue actually went down. A loss to government is a  
gain for everyone else. Lower revenue means government is less of  
a burden on the American people, and that the economy is that  
much freer. That's why we should be as thrilled to see a falling  
tax take as a falling crime rate. Each makes people that much  
more secure in their person and property.   
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
What about the deficit? It's true that deficits crowd out  
private investment, tempt the Treasury into monetizing debt, and  
drive up interest rates. A balanced budget, with both spending  
and taxes low, is a joy to behold.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But we live in the age of deficits not because taxes are too  
low, but because government has been freed from the obligation to  
back the currency with gold. It's no coincidence that the budget  
was last balanced in 1969, when gold restricted the Treasury's  
ability to pile up debt.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Why do increases and decreases in the deficit always seem to  
surprise the political class? Because its size is influenced by  
factors over which they have little control, like economic  
growth, the business cycle, the size of the underground economy,  
and the numbers of people receiving wages and salaries. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
One thing politicians can control is how much government 
steals from our paychecks every year. But to fix that, we must  
first trash the 1990 budget deal. Concocted by an evil genius,  
it's the only budget agreement in the last two decades that  
anyone bothers to obey. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
So long as "revenue neutrality" is the rule, leviathan will  
grow and grow, and the Republican promise to reduce the size of  
government will continue to be a rhetorical cover for the same  
old political racket.

<title>Rockwell: "Civil Rights" Hits the Adoption Industry -- 5/08/96</title>

<h2>
"Civil Rights" Hits the Adoption Industry
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>

<P>
  
Federal offices aren't often surrounded by protesters. But   
egregious civil-rights decisions against Mitsubishi and Hooters   
inspired their workers to take to the streets. Meanwhile, lesser   
victims of the civil-rights police are forced to suffer in   
silence as legal defense bills threaten bankruptcy.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The Justice Department and the EEOC decide what constitutes   
"discrimination" on grounds of race, religion, age, disability,   
and sex, the most sensitive areas of our national life. Since any   
action can be construed as somehow influenced by them, the   
government can exercise ferocious power over a vast range of   
economic decisions.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


When a business is involved, bureaucrats act as the   
sure-to-win plaintiff's lawyers capable of imposing de facto  
quotas in any business or industry. It has the power to brand   
companies with labels like "racist" and "sexist," and drive them   
to ruin. It is a main reason why race relations are so rotten   
today, and why, more than three decades after the Civil Rights   
Act, everyone feels more victimized than ever.  
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Not only has the Congress done nothing to curb this, it is   
preparing to expand government power into the makeup of our   
families. The pretext is a bill making it easier to adopt   
children. There is a $5,000 tax credit, "paid for" by higher   
taxes on business. But the heart of the bill is a provision   
putting the federal government in charge of adoption and   
foster-child services, imposing huge new costs, and robbing   
prospective parents of the freedom to choose.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


In the adoption process, adoptive parents, biological   
parents, and children work directly with public and private   
adoption agencies. After years of experience, agencies have   
learned which matches are likely to succeed, and which are not.   
The criteria are often unquantifiable, but can include such   
factors as race and ethnicity.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


For example, a Vietnamese family may know of some Vietnamese   
orphans in need of permanent loving homes. So long as the match   
is otherwise suitable, the agency will work with the parents to   
accommodate their request. Children are then brought together   
with adoptive parents who will love them and care for them.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


But Washington planners find this intolerable, and so are   
scheming to abolish it. They don't want people to be able to   
specify the race of the children they want to adopt; nor do they   
want an agency to be able to draw on its experience in working   
with parents insofar as race is involved. The planners would   
replace the right of contract with bureaucratic edict.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


In the Washington tradition of antonymous titles, the bill   
is called the "Adoption Promotion and Stability Act." It mandates   
that adoption providers can no longer "discriminate in making a   
placement decision" on the basis of national origin, race, and color.  
The original bill was so draconian it had to be amended to   
say race can be one factor if more than one "qualified" family   
want the child. In fact, the amendment counts for nothing.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Let's say a young mother considers giving up her child for   
adoption. Today, she is allowed, within reason, to specify what   
kind of family she would like her child to be brought up in,   
including the racial makeup of that family. If this bill passes,   
the agency will not be allowed to take her wishes into account.   
Faced with less certainty about her child's future, she will be   
more likely to choose abortion.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The same goes for adoptive and foster parents. If the bill   
passes, they will still be able, for now, to request the sex and   
religion of the child they would like to care for. But any   
request regarding race or national origin will not be considered   
under most conditions. Will the Vietnamese couple be just as   
interested in adopting a white or black child? Of course not, and   
they might just drop out of the process.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


How will the government know whether discrimination takes   
place? In its usual ham-fisted fashion, it will count the   
numbers, establish quotas, and override people's preferences. It   
will substitute private judgment with rule by bureaucrats and   
lawyers, and give the Justice Department veto power over all   
private decisions that affect adoption and foster care.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


This law will also be subject to category creep like other   
civil-rights bills. It's only a matter of time before religion,   
sex, and disability are added to the list. In time, Washington   
will be running the private and state-level child placement   
industry the way it runs its own welfare bureaucracies.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The proponents of the bill make the wildly unproven claim   
that all delays in foster and adoptive placements are due to   
discrimination against minorities. They have demonized the   
National Association of Black Social Workers for seeking black   
homes for black children. Like all liberals bent on social   
engineering, they pursue their plans with a John Brown-like fury   
and blindness to the other side.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


What, then, is the real cause of sluggishness and   
disequilibrium in the system? Federal laws that overregulate the   
industry and prevent a well-functioning market for parental   
rights from emerging. So these revolutionary Republicans, instead  
of repealing the existing government interventions, impose more.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

 
The result will be to make adoptive agencies and social   
service providers vulnerable to killer lawsuits from parents who   
experience any delay. "Public-interest" lawyers will also file   
civil suits by the thousands, and tie the placement process in   
knots. In a system already replete with broken hearts, this will   
impose limits on the numbers of organizations willing to be   
involved in the first place.  
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The bill will not end up "promoting the adoption of minority   
children," as supporters claim, because Washington can't people from  
deciding not to be adoptive or foster parents, or from choosing  
abortion over childbearing. The more freedom of choice the government  
takes away, the less anyone will want to bear the burden in the first  
place.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


There's a moral principle involved here too. The federal   
government has long managed our associations with regard to race   
at ever more intimate levels, and the results have been awful.  
Now it wants to make the same divisive intervention into the   
makeup of families. What's next? Non-discrimination laws for   
marriage?  
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


It's time we begin to trust the judgment of the private   
sector, and local levels of government over federal, and stop   
transferring power to Washington. Unlike Mitsubishi and Hooters,   
the children and parents victimized by civil rights enforcement   
aren't in a position to stage public protests.

<h4>THOMAS A. SCHATZ</h4> 
President<br> 
Citizens Against Government Waste and<br> 
Council for Citizens Against Government Waste<br> 
</center> 
<p> 
Thomas A. Schatz is President of Citizens Against Government Waste (CAGW) and the Council for 
Citizens Against Government Waste (CCAGW). 
<p> 
CAGW was founded by J. Peter Grace and Jack Anderson in 1984 following the release of the Grace 
Commission report. It is a 501(c) (3) nonprofit, educational organization with more than 600,000 
members nationwide. Mr. Schatz is a nationally recognized spokesperson on government waste and has 
appeared on hundreds of radio talk shows from coast to coast, including WBZ in Boston, WGN in 
Chicago, KABC in Los Angeles, WCBS in New York, and WOAI in San Antonio. His national television 
appearances include: "ABC News with Peter Jennings," "CBS News with Dan Rather," "NBC News with 
Tom Brokaw," CNN, CNBC, "Larry King Live," "The McNeil-Lehrer News Hour," and numerous local 
network affiliates. 
<p> 
According to official Office of Management and Budget figures, implementation of Grace Commission 
recommendations saved taxpayers $152.4 billion through 1990, and CAGW estimates another $ 100 
billion have been saved since then. An additional $78 billion will be saved over the next five years from 
recommendations proposed by CAGW in 1993 and $54 billion will be saved over the next five years from 
recommendations proposed by CAGW in 1994. 
<p> 
As President of CCAGW, the 501(c) (4) nonprofit lobbying organization, Mr. Schatz spearheaded the 
expansion of the grassroots Taxpayers Action Network to more than 400 chapters nationwide. Mr. Schatz 
has also testified on government waste issues before committees of the United States Senate and House of 
Representatives. 
<p> 
During his nine years with CAGW, Mr. Schatz has been instrumental in a development program that 
increased membership from 5,000 to more than 600,000. 
<p> 
Prior to joining CAGW in 1986, Mr. Schatz spent six years as legislative director for Congressman 
Hamilton Fish and two years practicing law and lobbying. 
<p> 
Mr. Schatz holds a law degree from George Washington University and was graduated from the State 
University of New York at Binghamton with a BA degree, With Honors, in Political Science. He is 
married to Leslee Behar and has two daughters, Samantha and Alexandra.

<title>Schatz: Radioactive Tax Boondoggle  -- 08/01/96</title>

<h2>Radioactive Tax Boondoggle</h2>

By<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/schatz.html"> Thomas A. Schatz</a><br>
President,<br><a href="/govt-waste/home.html">Citizens Against Government Waste</a> 
 <P></center><hr>
<br> 

It's hard to imagine the government waste watchdog group Citizens Against
Government waste (CAGW), the conservative Heritage Foundation, the
Libertarian Cato Institute, and Taxpayers for Common Cents agreeing on a
policy issue with The Safe Energy Communication Council, Friends of the
Earth, and the U.S. Public Interest Research Group. And yet it's true.
These and other philosophically divergent organizations are united in their
opposition to more taxpayer funding for one of the most egregious symbols
of pork-barrel spending: the so-called Advanced Light Water Reactor (ALWR).
<P>
Bringing the budget ax down on the Department of Energy's ALWR program
should be a no-brainer for Congress. The drive to revive nuclear power with
taxpayer subsidies has failed on Main Street, Wall Street, and in the
utilities' executive suites.
<P>
Today, there's simply no domestic market for these reactors, and the
international opportunities are drying up as more governments turn their
backs on this economically-challenged energy source. Every U.S. reactor
ordered in the past 23 years has been subsequently canceled.
<P>
Two independent surveys released earlier in 1996 show that seven out of ten
American voters and nine out of ten utility CEOs don't want new nuclear
plants tax-funded or built, respectively. Most, if not all, forecasting
reports from Wall Street brokerage and investment firms wouldn't argue with
Bear Stearns analyst Daniel Scotto who quipped that the next nuclear
reactor would be built "when Jimmy Hoffa was found alive and well."
<P>
Yet, after spending 60 percent of all U.S. energy research and development
money on nuclear power between 1948 and 1996 (despite the fact that it now
only provides 8 percent of our overall energy needs), Congress is debating
whether to pump more of our tax dollars into the ALWR program.
<P>
Authorized by the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT), the ALWR was
originally intended as a five-year program to develop advanced commercial
nuclear reactors for the domestic market. But the program has become a
corporate welfare poster child, financially benefiting major firms such as
General Electric (GE), Westinghouse, and Asea Brown Boveri/Combustion
Engineering. In 1994, these three companies alone had combined revenues of
$73 billion.
<P>
U.S. taxpayers have provided more than $275 million for this program
between fiscal years (FY) 1992-1996. The fifth and final year of funding
ends in September, but the Energy Department has requested an additional
$40 million for FY 1997, and Westinghouse envisions itself on the receiving
end of funding through FY 1999.
<P>
Now, however, even the monolithic nuclear industry is wavering on the
ALWR's worth. In February, GE, one of the primary recipients of tax funds
for the ALWR program, announced that it was abandoning its Simplified
Boiling Water Reactor program (one of the reactor programs within the ALWR
program), which has received more than $50 million in taxpayer subsidies.
GE defended its withdrawal, stating that "extensive evaluations -- have not
established the commercial viability of these designs," a clear-cut
repudiation of the program's original rationale if there ever was one.
Taxpayers will most likely never recover this investment.
<P>
But there's more. Besides lining corporate pockets for dead-end research,
taxpayer funds have also been used to reimburse the above-named companies
for a portion of the fees charged by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission
(NRC) for its costs to license and certify reactor designs. In other words,
taxpayers are covering the fees which were imposed in order to help offset
the costs of the NRC's services.
<P>
The ALWR program was intended to assist in the design of reactors to be
built in the United States. But since there is no domestic market, U.S.
taxpayer-supported reactor designs -- whose certification by the NRC has been
partially subsidized by the taxpayer under this program -- are being marketed
and sold in Japan, South Korea and other countries. This is a violation of
the intent of EPACT, which stipulates that recipients of any ALWR funds
must promise to construct and operate the reactor in the United States.
<P>
Fortunately, a bipartisan coalition in Congress, spearheaded by Reps. Mark
Foley (R-FL) and David Obey (D-WI) has formed to block any proposals for
continued funding the ALWR. Whether these federal purse-watchers will
succeed depends on citizens raising their voices loudly enough for Congress
to get the message.
<P>
Cutting this tax-vacuum would be an unequivocal statement that Members of
Congress are committed to cutting waste and redirecting budget priorities
to the nation's economic good. It's time to get this tax hog out of the
federal trough.

<title>Schatz:  Finders Keepers -- 12/21/95</title>

<h2>Finders Keepers</h2>



By<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/schatz.html"> Thomas A. Schatz</a><br>
President,<br><a href="/govt-waste/home.html">Citizens Against Government Waste</a> 
 <P></center><hr>
<br> 
 

  
  
Picture this: You've been living beyond your means and have had to 
borrow a great deal of money over the years just to keep your bills 
paid and family fed.  Finally, after much procrastination and a few 
sleepless nights, you put yourself and family on a regimen, aiming to 
balance your books over the next seven years while still meeting your 
basic needs.  Tackling  the accumulated debt and interest comes next.  
Then one day, a psychic from the CIA tells you that there's a good 
chance -- but not a guarantee -- that you'll come into some money 
during that seven-year period. 
<P>
What do you do?  Do you spend that hypothetical money, reverting to 
the bad habits that put you in this fix to begin with, or resolve to 
stick to your seven-year plan, recognizing the slim margin of error in 
your calculations and questionable reliability of CIA psychics?   And 
if that psychic turns out to be correct, do you balance your budget 
faster, let's say in five years, and begin to reduce your massive 
debt?  Or do you blow the windfall as usual, costing you more money in 
the long run and imperiling the financial security of your family?  
The logical, responsible answer is to do everything in your power to 
balance your budget faster, start paying off your debt, and break 
free. 
<P>
That's what a reasonable person would do, particularly someone who is 
trying to overcome a lifetime of profligacy.  But in the logic-free 
zone of our nation's capitol, the moral of this parable doesn't 
necessarily track.    
<P>
As Congress and President Clinton continue their dance around the 
budget solution, there's talk of "finding" more money, either through 
revamped economic assumptions or a change in the calculation of the 
consumer price index.  And naturally, being a city of addicts, there's 
already talk in some quarters of spending what has yet to be "found," 
despite the fact that the two sides' budget plans are still hundreds 
of billions of dollars apart.  So while economic assumptions are 
always debatable, and the consumer price index is undoubtedly 
inflated, the idea that we can make things right just by juggling the 
numbers sends the message loud and clear that politics as usual 
continues to rule the roost.  For politicians searching for an easy 
way out, and an escape valve for mounting pressures, it is a nearly 
irresistible solution.          
<P>
So steeped is this city in the compulsion to spend, and so blurred can 
rhetoric and reality become, that it's always worthwhile reviewing the 
facts.    
<P>
Doomsayers have led those unfamiliar with Washington lexicon into  
believing that one, the Republican plan cuts spending, and two, does 
so in a way that will adversely affect the country.  Baloney all 
around.  First, spending will increase in each of the seven years even 
under the "radical" Republican plan. And second, the long-term 
economic benefits of getting the nation's fiscal house in order will 
be worth it.    
<P>
If the Republican plan is adopted, the federal government will spend 
$12 trillion over the next seven years -- an average of $1.7 trillion 
annually.  Medicare will increase 6.4 percent annually -- the most of 
any federal program -- and the per-beneficiary increase will be 47 
percent.  The earned income tax credit, which the president says is 
destroyed by the Republican budget, will increase by 150 percent.  
Student loan volume will increase by 50 percent.  Medicaid goes up by 
30 percent.   
<P>
Give, these projections, the real question is:  How much more do we 
really need to spend?  And what can we afford if, like the person in 
our parable, we're carrying around a $5 trillion debt? 
<P>
Already, interest rates have dropped in anticipation of a balanced 
budget agreement.  The effect on families for housing, car payments, 
education, and other expenses is enormous.  A two percent drop in 
rates can mean thousands less each year in such payments. 
<P>
If there isn't a deal, we will be violating one of Thomas Jefferson's 
moral precepts:  "We should consider ourselves unauthorized to saddle 
posterity with our debts, and morally bound to pay them ourselves."  
Nobel Laureate James Buchanan recently noted that up until the past 
several decades, balancing the budget was part of our "effective 
constitution," but that "we have lost the moral sense of fiscal 
responsibility to make formal constraints unnecessary." 
<P>
There's a great national debate over "family values."  What kind of 
standards are we setting for future generations?  Without a balanced 
budget, we will pass on a tax rate of 84 percent to our children and 
grandchildren just to pay our bills.  A child born today will pay 
$187,000 in taxes over a lifetime just to pay his or her share of the 
interest on the national debt.  Is that a legacy we can live with?   
<P>
<P>
We can avoid such a fate simply by living within the parameters of the 
Republican plan.   While priorities can always be negotiated, and 
should be negociated, $12 trillion is more than enough money to meet 
the nation's true needs over the next seven years.  And if additional 
funds surface in re-estimates of economic assumptions, let's make the 
moral and just decision to balance the budget faster, start paying off 
the debt, and save the future for our children and grandchildren.

<title>Schatz:  No Virginia, There is no Budget in Washington</title>

<h2>No Virginia, There is no Budget in Washington</h2>


By<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/schatz.html"> Thomas A. Schatz</a><br>
President,<br><a href="/govt-waste/home.html">Citizens Against Government Waste</a> 
 <P></center><hr>
<br> 
 
There is no such thing as a "budget process" for the federal 
government.  
<p>
Any junior executive will tell you that a real budget is a financial 
plan; it controls how much money may be spent, both overall and for 
each spending category, before any checks are actually cut.  The Grace 
Commission called the federal budget "a political document, ... of 
limited usefulness as a vehicle for planning, control or evaluation."  
Here we are 12 years later and, as Yogi Bera said, "it's deja vu all 
over again." 
<p>
Money is often appropriated without regard to revenue, a practice 
which has been taken for granted for years, but which has lead to a 
federal debt of more than $4.9 trillion.  Even with better than 
average odds that Congress will reach a balanced budget by the year 
2002, the debt is still expected to top out at nearly $6 trillion.   
<p>
The government's fanciful accounting practices invite waste, lack of 
accountability, and gross mismanagement.  But the long-term danger is 
that these distorted budget practices seriously imperil all the hard 
work and political courage being demonstrated on Capitol Hill to bring 
the federal spending juggernaut under control.  
<p>
The annual budget battle over appropriations has become an 
exasperating exercise in futility.  This year, thanks to the tenacity 
of House Appropriations Committee Chairman Bob Livingston (D-La.), and 
many like-minded members of Congress, a significant number of wasteful 
government programs and pork-barrel projects will be purged from the 
13 appropriation bills.  But members who scour the bills looking for 
juicy bits of bacon complain, correctly, that it is the budget system 
itself that allows unwanted pork projects to filter through.   
<p>
In the next phase in the fight for sound government, fiscally 
responsible members of Congress from both sides of the aisle have 
offered budget reform bills to bring federal budget policies in line 
with reality and with private sector practices.  
<p>
A budget reform bill offered by Reps. Christopher Cox (R-Calif.) and 
Steve Largent (R-Okla.) would reconfigure the process from the ground 
up, seeking an end to that mindless annual scramble for scarce federal 
dollars which passes for the appropriations process.  The bill's 
philosophy was summed up when Rep. Cox wrote recently:  "A budget, 
properly used, should provide a framework for the individual spending 
decisions that follow.  The adoption of a budget, therefore, is not 
the proper time to debate those individual decisions."  The 
Cox/Largent legislation would enact a "budget first, spend second" 
provision, reduce the federal budget to a one-page, 19-function 
resolution, and toughen the president's enhanced rescission powers. 
<p>
The spirit of the Cox bill is mirrored in a "truth in budgeting" act 
Rep. Joe Barton (R-Tex.) will introduce on November 8.  His bill would 
create a more workable and understandable budget process by 
introducing biennial budgeting, creating a reserve (rainy day) fund 
for fiscal emergencies, putting an end to the fanciful concept of 
baseline budgeting, and enforcing sequestration if spending goes over 
enacted budget and entitlement caps. 
<p>
Sen. Connie Mack (R-Fla.) is proposing budget reform as well, 
including a Spending Reduction Commission. 
<p>
All of these efforts finally begin to liberate the federal government 
from baseline budgeting, the foundation of Washington's "weird 
science."  Baseline budgeting is an entrenched accounting gimmick 
which allows Congress and the President to say with a straight face 
that a reduction in the increase of an agency's budget is actually a 
"cut."   
<p>
The proposed changes may seem common sensical, but they represent 
dramatic change to the Kafkaesque world of federal spending.  Congress 
has been loath to make these "easy" choices in the past, even with 
solid bi-partisan support.  It is so much easier to crow about hard-
fought budget savings from program terminations, while still being 
able to take credit for redirecting the money into other programs and 
trust fund accounts.  This "carve and spend" will continue to 
frustrate real efforts to reduce spending unless Congress moves 
forcefully to overhaul the budget process itself.  The lock-box bill 
approved by the House earlier this year, which will permit saved funds 
to go toward deficit reduction, is a big first step.  But a major 
overhaul must follow, and soon. 
<p>
Reform-minded members like Reps. Cox, Largent, and Barton represent 
the next wave in the revolution that began last November.  Budget 
reform must be at the top of Congress' "to do" list for the next 
session.  Anything less than a full frontal assault on congenital 
budget gimmickry and accounting trickery will make a mockery of all 
the hard-fought gains achieved this session and guarantee that we will 
never get spending under control.

<h2>            
Senate Should Reject the Chemical Weapons Convention
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly </a><p><BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


      The U.S. Senate should reject ratification of the Chemical
     Weapons Convention (CWC), a treaty that purports to ban chemical
     weapons and forbid their production, stockpiling, and use.
     Contrary to its announced purpose, this foolish treaty would
     increase, not eliminate, the risk of chemical weapons use, and
     would seriously damage U.S. national security interests.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Bad guys are deterred by force, the threat of force, or by their
     cold calculation that the costs of evil behavior are not worth
     the risk. Many dangerous countries, such as Libya, Syria, Iraq
     and North Korea, have not signed the CWC and would not be
     deterred by pieces of paper.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     China and Iran, which have significant chemical weapons programs,
     are unlikely to comply. Of particular concern is Russia, which
     has the largest arsenal of chemical weapons; the actions and
     statements of its military leaders confirm that Russia would not
     comply at all.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Even though the CWC would not rid the world of chemical weapons,
     it would impose a terrible regulatory and reporting burden on
     every U.S. company that produces, processes, or consumes a
     scheduled chemical. The CWC would affect U.S. firms that make
     dyes and pigments, insecticides, pharmaceuticals, ceramics,
     nylon, paint and varnish, electronics, textiles, and soap and
     detergent.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The Arms Control and Disarmament Agency estimates that 2,175 U.S.
     companies would be saddled with reporting requirements and data
     declarations; others estimate that the burden will fall on 10,000
     U.S. production facilities. This time-consuming reporting could,
     in turn, produce additional government oversight and regulation
     by agencies such as OSHA, EPA, and IRS.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     No previous treaty has ever subjected U.S. private industry to
     international inspection. CWC is the New World Order closing in
     on American business.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The process of allowing teams of foreigners to investigate,
     inspect and challenge all facets of private U.S. businesses could
     open them up to industrial espionage and the theft of their
     proprietary information. Forcing them to spend unnecessary funds
     to hire more people to fill out more government forms, and submit
     to routine inspections, would reduce their ability to compete in
     world markets.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     In addition to the costs to be borne by private industry, the
     treaty would require the United States to pick up the tab for 25
     percent of the costs of implementation and verification at an
     estimated cost of $200 million a year. Other countries would
     probably demand that the United States pay their costs of
     implementation, too.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Of course, the CWC would give birth to a new international
     bureaucracy. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical
     Weapons is already headquartered in The Hague with a Conference
     of State Parties, an Executive Council, and a Technical
     Secretariat whose verification responsibilities extend over a
     hundred pages.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Every time we hear trendy slogans such as "global village,"
     "world economy," or "international cooperation," Americans should
     remember that other nations have no familiarity with or
     understanding of our Bill of Rights or our federal structure of
     government with separate state laws. Treaties are customarily
     written as though all power to make and fulfill international
     commitments resides in the head of state who signs the document.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     If the CWC goes into effect, what happens to our Fourth Amendment
     rights? The CWC's Technical Secretariat, without a warrant, would
     be empowered to inspect virtually everything within the premises,
     including records, files, papers, processes, controls, structures
     and vehicles, and to interrogate on-site personnel.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Under CWC, what happens to our First Amendment rights? Freedom of
     Information requests will not be permitted under the proposed CWC
     implementing legislation, so Americans would have fewer rights
     under this treaty than if a U.S. agency, such as the FBI,
     investigated them.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     As implemented by the Clinton Administration, the CWC would have
     a meddling effect in U.S. affairs. It would forbid U.S.
     commanders to use tear gas and other riot-control substances to
     protect our soldiers and minimize civilian casualties.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The CWC is unverifiable and unenforceable. Former CIA Director
     James Woolsey testified on June 23, 1994 that "the chemical
     weapons problem is so difficult from an intelligence perspective,
     that I cannot state that we have high confidence in our ability
     to detect noncompliance, especially on a small scale."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     In closed societies, factories making fertilizer,
     pharmaceuticals, or plastics can easily cover up their production
     of chemical weapons. After receiving notification of a challenge,
     a facility has six days to hide the evidence before inspectors
     are admitted.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Small amounts of concealed chemical weapons can be militarily
     very significant. Used against critical military targets,
     chemical weapons can have dramatic consequences.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     To paraphrase a popular bumper strip, when chemical weapons are
     outlawed, only outlaw governments will have chemical weapons. Our
     World War II experience shows that the best way for civilized
     countries to prevent the use of chemical weapons is for the good
     guys to have their own deterrent arsenals of chemical weapons.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     In any event, the Senate must not make matters worse by ratifying
     the unenforceable, costly, and probably unconstitutional CWC.

           Self-Appointed Monitors Of Corporate Responsibility
</h2><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly </a><p><BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          The CEO of Cypress in Silicon Valley has just issued an
          eloquent put-down of the social-responsibility
          busybodies who are trying to intimidate corporations
          into selecting their boards of directors on the basis
          of racial and gender diversity. T.J. Rodgers wrote a
          letter to the Sisters of St. Francis in Philadelphia
          who had used their ownership of a little Cypress stock
          to engage in leftwing mischief-making.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          Far from being put on the defensive by having a convent
          of nuns lecture him on corporate responsibility,
          Rodgers rejected their arguments as "not only unsound,
          but even immoral." He admonished them that Cypress's
          board of directors "is not a ceremonial watchdog, but a
          critical management function."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          Cypress's directors need to have experience as a CEO of
          an important technology company and direct expertise in
          the semiconductor business based on education (usually
          with a Master's degree in engineering science) and
          management experience. Contrary to the nuns' argument,
          Rodgers explained that "a woman's view on how to run
          our semiconductor company does not help us, unless that
          woman has an advanced technical degree and experience
          as a CEO."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          Sounds like common sense, doesn't it. "I believe," he
          said, "that placing arbitrary racial or gender quotas
          on corporate boards is fundamentally wrong."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          The nuns had tried to lay a guilt trip on Cypress by
          suggesting that it lacks corporate "morality" and
          Christianity by failing to appoint a board of directors
          with "equality of sexes, races, and ethnic groups."
          Rodgers didn't hedge in his response. "I am unaware,"
          he said, "of any Christian requirements for corporate
          boards; your views seem more accurately described as
          `politically correct,' than `Christian.' "
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
         Then, Rodgers went on to argue that the nuns'
          presumptuous requirements for corporate boards are
          "immoral," which he defined as "causing harm to
          people." He pointed out how all the retirees whose
          pension funds invest in Cypress would suffer if Cypress
          were run on anything other than a profit-making basis.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          The letter from the nuns was so sanctimonious that it
          did not allow for any possibility that a CEO could be
          moral if he disagreed with their position. I found
          myself cheering when Rodgers told the sisters to "get
          down from your moral high horse."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          Cypress employees in San Jose averaged $78,741 in
          salary and benefits in 1995. All are Cypress
          shareholders, have a first-rate health-care plan,
          profit-sharing, and other goodies such as gifts of
          personal computers and employee education.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          Rogers reiterated that "choosing a board of directors
          based on race and gender is a lousy way to run a
          company. We will never be pressured into it. We simply
          cannot allow arbitrary rules to be forced on us by
          organizations that lack business expertise."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          Rodgers obviously warmed up to the challenge of do-good
          busybodyism. "The political pressure to be what is
          euphemized as a `responsible corporation' today," he
          said, "is so great that it literally threatens the well
          being of every American."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          Rodgers listed some of the other special-interest
          groups that are harassing corporations about their pet
          issues. These include the complaints that corporations
          are not sufficiently "environmentally conscious," that
          they do business with certain countries, or supply the
          Armed Forces, or pay their CEO too much, or give to
          certain charities.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          Rodgers cited a Fortune magazine report showing that
          the so-called "ethical mutual funds" that invest
          according to a social-issues agenda, which control $639
          billion in investments, produced an 18.2 percent return
          in the last 12 months, while the S&P 500 returned 27.2
          percent. Thus, the investors in the "ethical funds"
          lost 9 percent of $639 billion, or $57.5 billion in one
          year, because they invested on a social-issues basis!
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          Rodgers lashed out at the current election-year frenzy
          in Washington to institutionalize the so-called
          "corporate responsibility" concepts promoted by Labor
          Secretary Robert Reich and Senators Ted Kennedy, Jeff
          Bingaman and Tom Daschle. Their proposals "provoke fear
          and anger against America's business," and are
          fundamentally wrong.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          One Bingaman-Daschle proposal would grant a low federal
          tax rate of 11 percent to "responsible corporations,"
          i.e., companies that limit the pay of their CEO to no
          more than 50 times the company's lowest-paid employee.
          Such a rule would limit the pay of the CEO of the
          world's most important semiconductor company (Intel) to
          less than that of a second-string quarterback in the
          NFL.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          Commenting on the double standards of the "leftist, out
          of touch with reality" Senators, Rodgers asked, "How
          long will it be before Senators Kennedy, Bingaman, and
          Daschle hold hearings on the `irresponsible
          corporations' that pay tens of millions of dollars to
          professional athletes? Or are athletes a `protected
          group,' leaving CEOs as their sole target?"
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          Rodgers concluded by stating that he stands for
          "personal and economic freedom, for free minds and free
          markets, a position irrevocably in opposition to the
          immoral attempt by coercive utopians to mandate even
          more government control over America's economy." May
          his tribe increase, and may his forthright statement
          embolden other CEOs to speak up, too.

Whatever Happened To Competition in School?
</h2><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly </a><p><BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     When it comes to the Olympic Games, everyone seems to understand
     that competition produces the winners and the record-breakers.
     It's unlikely that the athletes could reach such heights of
     achievement and endurance if they were not competing against
     other athletes who are closely matched in skills and putting
     forth their very best.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Some people, however, are at war against the whole concept of
     competition. They think it is undemocratic, unfair, and elitist.
     It's a sign of the times that, in Cecil County, Maryland,
     basketball is now played by some very unusual rules.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     If one basketball team is ten points ahead of the other,
     additional baskets don't count until the underdog team catches
     up. No record is kept of who scores how many baskets, so no
     player can ever be recognized as the star of the team.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     This system should be called Outcome-Based Basketball because
     it's just like the Outcome-Based Education (OBE) that has spread
     through our public schools like a contagious disease. OBE is
     sometimes called Performance-Based Education.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     OBE's advocates mouth the mantra "self-esteem." Since the lack of
     self-esteem is postulated to be the cause of all social ills
     (crime, illegal drugs, teenage pregnancies, AIDS, and low SAT
     scores), OBE's primary goal is to inculcate self-esteem.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     There is no evidence that lack of self-esteem causes those
     problems, nor is there any evidence that having self-esteem
     causes students to score better in academic subjects. At best,
     teaching self-esteem is a waste of precious classroom time and,
     at worst, it's teaching the wrong lesson that it's okay to feel
     good about doing poorly in school.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Self-esteem should be the reward that comes from achievement and
     hard work. It should be earned. But lack of evidence doesn't slow
     down the self-esteem peddlers because this mantra advances their
     goal of eliminating all competition from the school experience.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Outcome-Based Education has been properly labelled a dumbing-down
     of public school education. But it's even worse than reducing the
     amount of knowledge covered and failing to teach essential skills
     such as reading.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
    The combination of OBE and self-esteem eliminates competition as
     a learning mechanism. This destroys the students' incentive to be
     the best they can be, and it destroys the school's accountability
     because parents have no way to measure what their children are
     doing.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     In an OBE school, the traditional A, B, C, D and F are replaced
     by letters that are meaningless in terms of specific academic
     achievement, such as S for Satisfactory (sometimes it just means
     Sometimes) or G for Growth. William Glasser's 1969 book "Schools
     Without Failure" led the charge against traditional grades.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Glasser also argued that giving homework is unfair and elitist
     because A and B students usually do their homework, whereas poor
     students don't, thus widening the gap between those who succeed
     and those who fail in school. He even opposed objective tests
     because they require students to give correct answers, in
     contrast to tests that ask questions for which there are no right
     answers.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The anti-competition movement is galloping across America.
     Schools are getting rid of their honor roll, honors courses,
     class rankings, academic prizes, and even valedictorians.
     Spelling bees are out. If fact, even correct spelling is out;
     it's replaced by inventive spelling (so students can spell words
     any way they want).
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Ability grouping, or tracking, is forbidden as elitist,
     undemocratic, or even racist. Pity the poor teacher who has to
     present a single course of study to eighth graders whose reading
     ability ranges from the second to the twelfth grades. This
     problem is getting worse with the mainstreaming of the learning
     disabled.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     OBE does not allow any student to progress faster or farther than
     the slowest child in the class. This system conceals the fact
     that some children aren't learning much of anything.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     What is the teacher to do with the faster learners after they
     complete the assigned material? They are required to do peer
     tutoring (trying to tutor the slower pupils) or "horizontal
     enrichment." The former is a frustration for all students, and
     the latter is busywork.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Cooperative Learning, in which students receive a group grade, is
     another means of concealing who does the assignment accurately
     and who goofs off. The brighter students soon learn that their
     effort is not rewarded, and the slower students learn that
     there's no reason to try because someone will given them the
     answers.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The testing system has been corrupted. Not only do all students
     score "above average" (a marvel of statistical fakery), but many
     tests are peppered with questions that ask for non-objective
     responses about feelings, attitudes or predictions, or which have
     a built-in bias toward Political Correctness.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The response to the dramatic decline in SAT scores over the last
     two decades has resulted, not in toughening the curriculum, but
     in raising every student's score 100 points, so now students get
     perfect scores even if they have some wrong answers. This is one
     more way of concealing the distinction between average and
     above-average students.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Competition needs to be restored if schools are to prepare
     students for life. Children should learn early that life is
     competition, and the rewards go to those who work hard, persevere
     and achieve.

Phonics Boom
</h2><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly </a><p><BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     It's many years overdue, but the scandal of widespread illiteracy
     has finally become a topic of general discussion and debate, from
     local newspapers to network TV news. Americans are at last being
     told the tragic fact that the public schools are failing to teach
     children how to read.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Our largest and trendiest state suddenly forced the facts of
     illiteracy into the national news stream. California came in last
     in national fourth-grade reading tests, set up a state task force
     to find out why, held legislative hearings, discovered that the
     state's Whole Language method is a disaster, and earmarked $100
     million for new textbooks and teacher training to switch the
     schools back to phonics.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     In order to receive their share of the money, schools will have
     to give students "systematic explicit phonics instruction, with
     phonemic awareness, sound-symbol relationships, and decoding."
     Governor Pete Wilson is even requiring that school districts
     spend their federal Goals 2000 money on reading instruction.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Wilson's spokesman, Sean Walsh, was blunt. "Whole Language was an
     utter failure. Our curriculum taught to kindergarten to
     third-graders, quite frankly, stinks."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The Whole Language system teaches children to guess at words by
     looking at the pictures on the page, to memorize a few dozen
     frequently used words, to skip over words they don't know, to
     substitute words that seem to fit, and to predict the words they
     think will come next. The child who is taught those bad habits,
     instead of how to sound out the syllables, will never be able to
     read big words or become a good reader.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Many schools give high grades and happy report cards to children
     who are good at guessing and memorizing words, so parents don't
     realize that their children are being taught to guess instead of
     to read. Self-esteem is a higher priority than literacy.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     A federal agency called the National Assessment of Educational
     Progress (NAEP) publishes what is called the Reading Report Card
     for the Nation and the States. Its recently released report on
     the 1994 test given to 140,000 students in grades 4, 8 and 12 in
     public and private schools proves that schoolchildren's reading
     skills are not only bad, but are getting worse.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Comparing 1992 and 1994, the NAEP results show a significant
     decline in the percentage of students scoring at or above the
     "proficient level" and at or above the "basic level," and a
     significant increase in the percentage of pupils performing below
     the "basic level." The NAEP tests also show a lack of any
     positive results from the expensive federal Title I program for
     the disadvantaged.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     How did it happen that the entire public school system abandoned
     phonics and substituted a guessing system? It's rather easy to
     date and track the Whole Language system from its official
     adoption by the state of California in 1987, because California
     is a model for other states that want to be "progressive."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     But Whole Language was not a new idea in 1987; it was just a new
     name for the system that was already in widespread use called
     "whole word" or "look-and-say." The mystery as to how that stupid
     system swept the country, starting in the late 1930s, was
     revealed in a report aired the first week of June on National
     Public Radio.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     "Look-and-say" came to dominate the schools as a result of a
     sophisticated marketing plan carried out by Scott Foresman, the
     publishers of the "Dick and Jane" series of elementary school
     readers. Scott Foresman sent slick salesmen to every school
     district to demonstrate how easily children could be taught to
     "read" the inane "See Dick run" stories that had color
     illustrations of Dick, Jane and Spot (the dog) doing whatever the
     one-syllable words described.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     By the 1950s, the Dick and Jane readers were, as Newsweek now
     tells us, "ubiquitous." Rudolf Flesch's 1955 landmark book, "Why
     Johnny Can't Read," fully exposed the fact that this system is a
     cheat on everyone.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The typical first-grader already knows the meaning of thousands
     of big words, such as hamburger, basketball, birthday,
     toothbrush, and even hippopotamus and Philadelphia. But the child
     will not be able to read those words unless he is taught the
     skill of sounding out the syllables. That's what we call phonics.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
    It is encouraging to see that California is making a massive
     attempt to abandon the failed Whole Language system and switch to
     the proven method of phonics. But changing the educational system
     today will be like trying to change the course of an aircraft
     carrier with a rowboat.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Parents who want to make sure that their children are not
     handicapped by the dumbed-down methods used in most public
     schools today should assume the task of teaching their own
     children how to read. It's easy to do if you use intensive,
     systematic phonics. I did it with my six children, and I urge all
     parents to do likewise.

<html><head><title>Schlafly: Reject MFN For Communist China  -- 6/6/96</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg"><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><i>June 6, 1996</i><h2>                        
Reject MFN For Communist China
</h2><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly </a><p><BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Bill Clinton's policy of cozying up to Communist China by
     granting Most Favored Nation (MFN) status is in shambles. The
     question of the moment is, will Bob Dole let Clinton dangle on
     the limb of his own mistake or save him from embarrassment by
     agreeing with this shameful policy?<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     It was all so inconvenient. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
     Firearms (otherwise known as BATF, the agency that played a fatal
     game of cops and robbers against Americans at Waco and Ruby
     Ridge) finally did something useful. They arrested Chinese
     Communist agents for smuggling 2,000 AK-47 automatic assault
     rifles into the United States.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The Clinton Administration has such peculiar biases. The
     Administration engaged in hear-no-evil, see-no-evil as long as
     the Chinese Communists merely forced women to undergo late-term
     abortions, locked up citizens who dared to speak out for freedom,
     stole billions (not just millions) of dollars worth of U.S.
     intellectual property, thumbed their noses at signed trade
     agreements, and sold our weapons technology to rogue dictators.
     But when China violated our gun-control laws, that was just too
     much for the liberals!
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The BATF arrest of seven persons in the San Francisco Bay area
     stopped a very profitable Chinese business of selling weapons at
     a 400 percent mark-up to U.S. big-city gangs that want to wipe
     out their rivals. It was a sophisticated worldwide operation that
     must have enjoyed the complicity of the Chinese government.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Those arrested have direct links to China's Defense Ministry and
     Deng Xiaoping's son-in-law. To conceal the source of the weapons,
     the money was laundered through Beijing's state-run bank in Hong
     Kong.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     In the 18-month U.S. sting operation, the Chinese discussed with
     our undercover agents the future sale of explosives, anti-tank
     rockets, and shoulder-fired anti-aircraft systems capable of
     knocking planes out of the sky. One Chinese boasted he could
     bring 300,000 AK-47s into the U.S.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Selling all kinds of weapons is big business for Communist China.
     It has sold missiles to Iran and nuclear reactor technology and
     materials to make enriched uranium to Pakistan.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     China's expanding economy is financed by a $34 billion trade
     surplus with the United States that has cost Americans 700,000
     jobs. This trade surplus is partially based on stealing our
     products (computer software, video films, musical recordings,
     compact disks, other intellectual property, books, etc.) instead
     of buying them.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Pirated CDs and CD-ROMs are made in China in an estimated 31
     government-licensed plants. China itself can use only about two
     percent of the CDs produced, so the rest go into the
     international market and cheat U.S. companies out of sales.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     China signed an agreement to stop this theft in February 1995,
     but nothing has changed. China simply thumbs its nose at the
     whole concept of copyrights and trademarks.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     China has made so much money from U.S. trade that it is now
     trying to buy SS-18 strategic missiles, components and technology
     from Russia or Ukraine. For those who've forgotten our worries of
     the Cold War, the SS-18s are the biggies that can reach the
     United States from a launch on the other side of the world.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     China continues to persecute Tibet, use slave labor to produce
     goods for export, and show contempt toward any self-government
     for Hong Kong. China tried to threaten Taiwan's democratic
     election process by firing rockets at the island.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     U.S. big businesses, which want MFN because they lust after
     so-called "free trade" with China, should wake up and taste the
     chop suey that China served the McDonnell Douglas Corporation.
     Douglas pursued China's aviation market with the passion and
     naivete of a teenage suitor, but ended up (in the word of one
     Douglas executive) being "betrayed."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Over a costly 15-year courtship, Douglas gave China 80 years of
     accumulated aircraft-manufacturing experience. That was the
     largest technology transfer in history. Douglas taught China how
     to build commercial planes, trained Chinese engineers, and even
     turned over powerful weapons-producing technology.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Like classic con men, Chinese officials schmoozed Douglas by
     dangling the prospect of multi-billion-dollar aircraft purchases.
     Then China turned around and gave its juicy contract to Europe's
     Airbus.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Hypocrisy about the demands for MFN status has reached new
     heights on both sides. In America, the internationalist claque
     that continually calls for "free trade" ignores the fact that
     China has slapped a 30 percent tariff on goods it imports from
     the United States. In China, the ruling clique threatens to
     "punish" U.S. companies if we dare to criticize the $2 billion
     piracy of our intellectual property.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     It is ridiculous to allow Communist China to enjoy the same
     trading privileges with the United States markets that friendly
     countries have. Congress should reject Most Favored Nation status
     for Communist China, and Bob Dole should show leadership in
     calling for that rejection.

<html><head><title>Schlafly: Pupil Privacy Law Is Needed  -- 5/30/96</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg"><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><i>May 30, 1996</i><h2>                        
Pupil Privacy Law Is Needed

</h2><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly </a><p><BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     The school establishment has suddenly discovered a bill that
     passed the House last year and is pending in the Senate which may
     interfere with plans to build files of personal information on
     public school pupils and their families. The Family Privacy
     Protection Act was noncontroversial when it sailed through the
     House by 417 to 7, but the school establishment has gone into
     panic and sounded phony alarms over a whole page of the May 19
     New York Times.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Designed to protect pupil and family privacy, the bill is
     straightforward in stating that schools may not, without prior
     written parental consent, ask minors to answer questionnaires
     about political affiliations or beliefs, mental or psychological
     problems, sexual behavior or attitudes, illegal or
     self-incriminating behavior, appraisals of other family members,
     or religious affiliations or beliefs.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     That's a reasonable rule because the schools have no business
     eliciting that kind of personal or family information from
     students. But in an era when schools assert their right, without
     parental knowledge or consent, to pass out condoms and to force
     little girls to undress and undergo intrusive genital
     examinations, it looks like the schools want to reject all
     accountability to parents.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The hysteria of the school establishment against this bill is
     encapsuled in the lead sentence in the New York Times news
     article: "Research into illegal drug use by American adolescents
     could be stifled by legislation pending in Congress." This is
     followed by quotations from several Ph.D.s ominously predicting
     that the bill "will leave us conducting the war on drugs largely
     in the dark."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     One of these Ph.D.s who is crying around about how the law would
     "cripple" his surveys of schoolchildren, said sarcastically, "We
     also couldn't find out whether they believe in God, which some
     people think is important." Pardon me, but I don't believe he
     should be allowed to ask public schoolchildren whether or not
     they believe in God. Where is the ACLU when we need it?
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The widespread use of intrusive surveys and questionnaires in the
     public school classroom started in the mid-1970s and resulted in
     the passage of the first Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment in
     1978, sponsored by former university president and Senator Sam
     Hayakawa. The public school establishment was powerful enough to
     prevent regulations from being written until President Ronald
     Reagan demanded them in 1984.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     National Education Association agents in the Department of
     Education and public school administrators nationwide circled the
     wagons against this law. Despite egregious violations, it has
     never been enforced.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Take, for example, the infamous 149-question survey which has
     been given, despite parental objections, to nearly all 6th, 9th
     and 12th grade Minnesota pupils. Parents were up in arms about
     it, not only because it was privacy-invading, but also because it
     assumed that illegal drug use, promiscuity, and suicidal
     tendencies are normal teenage behavior.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Another serious objection was that it encouraged pupils to inform
     on their parents. That sort of interrogation of children should
     not be tolerated in a free society. Here's a typical question:
     "Has drinking by any family member repeatedly caused family,
     health, job or legal problems? If yes, who? (Mark all that
     apply.) Parent who lives with me, Parent who doesn't live with
     me, Brother or sister, Other relative, Other person who lives
     with me." Here's another: "Has drug use by any family member
     repeatedly caused family, health, job or legal problems? If yes,
     who? (Mark all that apply.)" The same options are offered.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Many questions conveyed the notion that the majority of teenagers
     are using illegal drugs. "If you use marijuana, how old were you
     when you started? If you use any other drug, how old were you
     when you started? How often do you get drunk?"
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Some questions interrogated the child about his religion. "How
     often do you attend religious services?" "How important is
     religion in your life?"
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Some questions would be downright traumatic for some children.
     "Have you ever tried to kill yourself?" "How often have you run
     away from home?" "Have you felt so discouraged or hopeless that
     you wondered if anything was worthwhile?"
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Of course, the survey included lots of Peeping Tom sex questions.
     "Have you ever had sexual intercourse (gone all the way)? If you
     have sexual intercourse, how often do you and/or your partner use
     any birth control method? Have you been pregnant?"
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The public schools have no business requiring children to answer
     any of these nosy questions without prior written parental
     consent. To assert that restricting these surveys will hamper our
     "war on drugs" is ridiculous.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The purpose of the pending legislation is to extend the scope of
     the law to all surveys and questionnaires that are federally
     funded, not merely those funded by the Department of Education,
     and also to remove some vague language that has enabled the
     public schools to circumvent the law for the past ten years.
     Senators should say ho-hum to the hysteria of those who might be
     restrained from asking children about matters that are none of
     their business.

What's Going On With Bob Dole's Friends? 
</h2><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly </a><p><BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     Why are the so-called Republican moderates undermining Bob Dole's 
     presidential candidacy? Doesn't he have enough problems without 
     his friends planting mines on his road to the White House? 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     First, Governors Christine Whitman and Pete Wilson gave cover to 
     Bill Clinton on his veto of the partial birth abortion ban, which 
     was overwhelmingly passed by Congress (with support from Bob 
     Dole) and was building to become a major Republican campaign 
     issue. When Whitman and Wilson said on national television that 
     they support Clinton's veto, they destroyed effective campaign 
     use of this issue by Bob Dole. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     Whatever one thinks about the abortion issue, this support of 
     Clinton by two prominent Dole supporters was completely 
     unnecessary and grossly unhelpful to his campaign. Dole had just 
     honored Whitman by naming her one of the two temporary chairmen 
     of the Republican National Convention. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     Secondly, we saw the incredible undermining of Bob Dole by his 
     longtime friend and fellow Kansan, Senator Nancy Kassebaum, as 
     well as the other moderates, Senators John Chafee, Slade Gorton, 
     Mark Hatfield, and even Kit Bond. What they did was to join the 
     Democrats on a motion (that passed 52-46) to remove Medical 
     Savings Accounts (MSAs) from Senator Dole's leadership amendment 
     to the Kennedy-Kassebaum health bill. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     MSAs are not only sound policy and very popular, but they are 
     supported by Bob Dole. They help to define the difference between 
     the parties: Republicans support MSAs because they promote choice 
     in doctors and treatment, portability and affordability, while 
     the Democrats oppose them with dishonest class-warfare rhetoric. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     Above and beyond the substance of the MSA argument, the Democrats 
     clearly recognized this vote as a crucial Clinton vs. Dole 
     political confrontation. Every single Democrat voted against MSAs 
     and Vice President Al Gore was rushed to the Senate Chamber in 
     case he was needed to break a tie vote. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     The rejection of MSAs in the Senate bill was a rejection of Bob 
     Dole's leadership. When Dole has friends like this, he doesn't 
     need any enemies. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     Third, Christian Coalition director Ralph Reed signaled his 
     willingness to accept a rewriting of the Republican Platform 
     plank on abortion. He gave talkative interviews that resulted in 
     front-page news stories in the New York Times for three days 
     running. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     Reed may have been trying to help Bob Dole by putting the 
     Christian Coalition's imprimatur on a move long demanded by the 
     moderates, namely, the removal of or watering down of the pro- 
     life plank in the Republican Platform. But his contradictory 
     statements (such as denying that he is trying to rewrite the 
     platform language and the same week releasing a new book that 
     specifically presents new platform language) have the effect of 
     encouraging the pro-choicers to keep the political pot boiling in 
     the media and then push for a prime-time floor fight at the 
     Republican National Convention in San Diego. That is decidedly 
     not helpful to Bob Dole. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     Reed's proposed new platform language uses the word 
     "constitutional" in a slippery and deceptive way. Instead of 
     calling for constitutional protection for the unborn and/or 
     overturning Roe v. Wade, he suggests using "legal and 
     constitutional means to protect the right to life." Under this 
     language, all actions would have to be in conformity with Roe v. 
     Wade. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     Reed's new book, excerpted this week in Newsweek, also lectures 
     religious conservatives to "shun harsh language" in "Clinton- 
     bashing." That's strange advice in this presidential campaign in 
     which the Democrats are already conducting a no-holds-barred 
     media advertising campaign of Republican-bashing. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     Reed is widely credited with clinching the nomination of Bob Dole 
     by using Christian Coalition troops to carry Iowa and 
     particularly South Carolina for Dole. But he's not helping Dole 
     now by fracturing the constituency that Dole desperately needs to 
     be elected. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     Fourth, in a Sunday television appearance, one of Bob Dole's 
     closest associates, Senator Al D'Amato, aimed daggers at Newt 
     Gingrich and Pat Buchanan, accusing the former of setting the 
     wrong agenda for the 104th Congress and the latter of being a 
     "philosophical ayatollah." That is hardly the way to unite the 
     party and encourage broad-based support of Bob Dole, and an 
     experienced politician like D'Amato must know this. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     Finally, Bill Kristol has weighed in with the argument that Bob 
     Dole can't win. That's one of the most hurtful slogans that can 
     be hung around the neck of any candidate. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     What's going on? Why are the people who were once so determined 
     that Dole be the Republican presidential candidate now sniping at 
     him?

<title>Schlafly: The Reincarnation Of Clinton Care  -- 5/9/96</title>

<h2>
The Reincarnation Of Clinton Care
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

.html">
Phyllis Schlafly 
</a>

<p><BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
One of the most obnoxious features of the Clinton health care
plan (which died the death of a thousand cuts in 1994) was its
creation of a long list of new federal "Health Care Crimes." 
It now appears that the Republicans, in their eagerness to
manifest their total capitulation to President Clinton, have
included an equally obnoxious crime section in their so-called
Health Reform bill (H.R.3160).
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Somehow this section (Title II), which parallels the discredited
and (we thought) defunct Clinton bill, was passed by the House
without anybody discovering its far-reaching ramifications. 
Then, Dr. Jane Orient, executive director of the Association of
American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS), read the bill and
discovered that much of this health crime section was copied from
the Clinton bill.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
AAPS is the organization whose lawsuit against Hillary Rodham
Clinton forced her to comply with federal law and make the
records of her Health Care Task Force public.  After two years of
litigation, Hillary's lawyers had to admit that they had lied to
the court in asserting that all members of the Task Force were
federal employees when, in fact, the Task Force included outside
special-interest groups with a direct financial interest in
passing the Clinton health care bill.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Republican Health Reform bill (H.R. 3160) criminalizes what
are called "federal health care offenses."  The definition is
excruciatingly broad:  a violation or conspiracy that involves
"any public or private plan or contract, affecting commerce,
under which any medical benefit, item, or service is provided to
any individual."  "No proof of specific intent to defraud is
required."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The bill specifies monetary penalties of "up to $10,000 for each
instance" of "failure to comply with statutory obligations,"
for "incorrect coding," or for providing "a medical or other
item or service that a person knows or should know is not
medically necessary."  Big Brother will decide what health
services are "necessary."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The new crime of "health care fraud" carries fines plus
imprisonment of up to ten years.  "If the violation results in
serious bodily injury," imprisonment can be up to 20 years, and
if death results it can be "for any term of years or for life."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A person who "intentionally misapplies" any assets of a health
care benefit program "shall be fined under this title or
imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both; but if the value of
such property does not exceed the value of $100 the defendant
shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one
year, or both."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Did you get that?  If you misapply a benefit that has a value of
less than $100, you can spend one year in prison and be fined,
too.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Whoever" makes a false statement to a health care plan is
liable to a five-year prison term.  "Whoever" can mean anybody,
patient or provider.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"In any investigation relating to any act or activity involving
a Federal health care offense, . . . [the Attorney General] may
require the production of any records that may be relevant." 
The Republicans' passion to turn over more and more power to
Janet Reno (which started with the Anti-Terrorism bill) is a
curiosity to behold.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Failure to provide health information, "oral or recorded in any
form or medium," to a criminal investigator from any government
agency carries a five-year prison term.  Information extracted
under this provision can be used against the patient if "the
action or investigation arises out of and is directly related to
the receipt of health care or payment for health care.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The bill's exotic forfeiture provisions put health care offenses
on a par with racketeering and drug dealing, and are actually
broader than under the Clinton bill.  "The court, in imposing
sentence on a person convicted of a Federal health care offense,
shall order the person to forfeit property, real or personal,
that constitutes or is derived, directly or indirectly, from
gross proceeds traceable to the commission of the offense."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The bill requires the Federal Government to "establish a
national health care fraud and abuse data collection program"
and specifies that "the information in this database shall be
available to Federal and State government agencies and health
plans" pursuant to any procedures set by the Secretary of Health
and Human Services (that's Donna Shalala).  This will empower the
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Federal Government to use medical records to prosecute almost
anybody.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
These provisions mean the end of patient privacy and
confidentiality of the physician-patient relationship.  Dr.
Orient asserts that they lay the foundation for forcing all
medical professionals to submit electronic information on every
medical encounter to a central computer, a practice that is
already required by a new Maryland law that takes effect this
July.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Maryland law will require all health care professionals to
disclose to the government the details of every patient
encounter, including diagnosis, test results, therapy, charges,
and 32 pieces of demographic data on every patient.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The only Republican part of the Health Reform bill is the section
on Medical Savings Accounts.  The rest of it is ClintonCare.  So,
why are the Republicans fronting for Bill Clinton and Ted
Kennedy?

<h2> 
Books About What's Going On At Colleges 
</h2>

Phyllis Schlafly 
</a> 
 
<P> 
Those who just learned about the dumbing down of our best colleges from the slashing  
report of the National Association of Scholars should do their homework by reading some  
of the excellent books written during the last several years.  Allan Bloom's "The Closing  
of the American Mind" was a trailblazer, but it was followed by several more informative  
books that failed to attract the attention they deserve. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"Impostors in the Temple" (Simon & Schuster, 1992) is what Martin Anderson, a former  
Columbia University professor and now a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, calls  
many of our nation's academic intellectuals -- that is, people who pretend to teach and  
pretend to do original, important work, but actually do neither.  He says that "the death of  
integrity in the heart of higher education is the root cause of the educational troubles  
which afflict us today." 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Dr. Anderson helps us to understand how it all happened at Stanford, one of the nation's  
most prestigious universities.  He describes how Stanford bilked the federal taxpayers out  
of millions of dollars and played a big role in the Political Correctness movement. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Dr. George Roche, president of Hillsdale College, demonstrates in "The Fall of the Ivory  
Tower" (Regnery, 1994) how the easy availability of federal money channeled to colleges  
and universities has corrupted our entire educational system.  He sets forth chapter and  
verse of why and how this is so. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The flow of taxpayers' money has resulted in a large percentage of students being  
admitted to college who have no business being there at all because they are academically  
or emotionally unprepared.  The high rate of default on student loans is a national  
scandal. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
One of America's most distinguished scholars, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution,  
Thomas Sowell gives us a realistic look at the decline, the deception and the false dogmas  
of the U.S. educational system, which he charges is morally and intellectually bankrupt.   
In "Inside American Education" (Free Press, 1993), he exposes the ideological  
indoctrination and double standards about behavior and race practiced at the leading  
universities. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Sowell says that they have presumed to be the conscience of society, while shamelessly  
exploiting college athletes, overcharging the government, organizing price-fixing cartels,  
and abandoning the teaching of undergraduates to student assistants while the tenured  
faculty pursue personal prestige. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Charles Sykes, author of "ProfScam:  Professors and the Demise of Higher Education"  
(St. Martin's Press, 1989), presents a devastating indictment of U.S. universities, which  
he calls vast citadels of waste, ruled with an iron hand by an oligarchy of arrogant,  
tenured professors who are overpaid and underworked. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Sykes names specific universities, professors, dates and places, and asserts that a  
university education is a scam which cheats students, parents, and taxpayers.  He says the  
universities offer more and more courses of less and less importance, including a plethora  
of junk courses referred to by students as "guts" (slang for a course that can be passed  
with no more preparation than gut instinct). 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Here are some examples he cites:  Anthropology of Play, Socio-Psychological Aspects of  
Clothing, Music Video 454, Sport and Political Ideology, Recreation and Leisure, Pocket  
Billiards, and Rock `n' Roll Is Here To Stay. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In his second book, "The Hollow Men -- Politics and Corruption in Higher Education"  
(Regnery Gateway, 1990), Charles Sykes explains the politicization of the college  
courses.  He tells how race, gender and class have been enshrined as the looking glasses  
through which all subject matter must be seen if one is to survive in academia. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Sykes explains how colleges have gone overboard with institutionalized affirmative  
action, sensitivity training, and anti-free speech codes.  The second half of the book is  
devoted to a case study of Dartmouth College, which became a prime example of the  
intolerance of those who preach "diversity." 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"Tenured Radicals" (Harper & Row, 1990) is the expression Roger Kimball uses to  
discuss the radical politics of many in academia. His main focus is on the absurdity of  
what passes for scholarship on the campuses, and he describes the unintelligible jargon,  
or "ProfSpeak," which passes for erudition in the academic world. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Kimball explains the deconstructionist movement, which he calls a hoax perpetrated by  
academics in order to create more possibilities for papers, symposiums, specialized  
classes, and university teaching positions. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In "The Closing of the American Heart" (Probe Books, 1990),Ronald H. Nash describes  
how the decline of moral and religious standards over the past 25 years has contributed to  
the collapse of the nation's educational standards.  He charges that moral illiteracy is

Dinesh D'Souza, in "Illiberal Education:  The Politics of Race and Sex on Campus" (Free  
Press, 1991), explains Political Correctness (P.C.) on college campuses.  He shows how  
P.C. produces closed-mindedness and intolerance, which is to say an "illiberal  
education."  He explains how Political Correctness opposes the teaching of Western  
Civilization and demands that professors give their first attention to race and gender  
issues.

LAS ESCUELAS PUBLICAS REQUIEREN COMPETENCIA
</H2>
Gary S. Becker*
<br>
<p>
CHICAGO (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>)
 (AIPE).- Durante la reciente campaña presidencial, Bill Clinton y
Bob Dole estuvieron de acuerdo en que el sistema de educación pública no
está cumpliendo con las necesidades educacionales de los niños pobres y de
clase media. Pero mientras que el Sr. Dole opina que la solución está en
darles vales o becas a estudiantes para que vayan a escuelas privadas, el
presidente acepta la posición de quienes se oponen a los vales, argumentando
que la competencia debilitaría a la educación pública.
<P>
 Yo creo, por el contrario, que la competencia mejoraría en vez de empeorar
la educación pública. Los opositores mantienen que a través de los vales y
de becas los colegios privados captarían a la crema, a los mejores y más
ambiciosos estudiantes. Como resultado, las escuelas públicas se quedarían
con los indisciplinados, los desinteresados y los mentalmente atrasados. Sin
embargo, tal escenario asume que las escuelas públicas no mejorarían con la
competencia.
<P>
 Hasta ahora, los colegios privados compiten con un brazo atado a la
espalda, por los subsidios de los contribuyentes que reciben las escuelas
públicas. Un sistema de vales, bajo el cual los padres puedan seleccionar la
mejor escuela para sus hijos, aplicaría una presión competitiva a las
escuelas públicas, promoviendo el cambio.
<P>
 La causa del mal desempeño de la educación pública no tiene nada que ver
con insuficiencia de fondos, ya que los gastos por estudiante -en términos
reales- se ha duplicado durante los últimos 30 años. A nivel nacional, el
costo por estudiante en escuelas públicas es de $5.000 al año y en muchas
ciudades alcanza $9.000 y hasta $11.000. El desalentador historial de las
escuelas públicas generalmente es por su mala selección de cursos, falta de
seguridad personal y poca disciplina, lo cual desincentiva todo esfuerzo por
aprender. El sector privado atraería estudiantes ofreciendo mejores
programas de estudio, incluyendo insistencia en tareas, disciplina y
participación de los padres, todo lo cual tiene gran atractivo para las
familias.
<P>
 Ya que la mayoría de los maestros y administradores de las escuelas
públicas están dedicados a la enseñanza, tratarán de reformar el sistema al
haber evidencia de que el sector privado está atrayendo a sus estudiantes
con los vales. Y si las escuelas públicas son lentas en cambiar y continúan
perdiendo alumnos habrá gran presión política para que respondan a la
competencia: les reducirán los presupuestos y se despedirán los directores y
administradores que no logren competir.
<P>
 Federal Express y UPS mejoraron considerablemente el sistema de correos de
este país al introducir un servicio rápido y confiable. Aunque el correo
perdió en la competencia de entregas de paquetes por ser el servicio privado
mucho mejor, a su vez mejoró su servicio en respuesta a la demanda del público.
<P>
 La economista de Harvard Minster Hoxby encuentra que la competencia de
escuelas parroquiales mejora la educación pública del distrito. Todos los
estudiantes mejoran y no hay evidencia de que los colegios católicos se
quedan con los mejores estudiantes.
<P>
 Muchos estudiantes extranjeros viajan desde  muy lejos para asistir a
universidades estadounidenses por su excelencia. La competencia que hay
entre miles de universidades mantiene despierto a profesores y administradores.
<P>
 El primer programa de becas universitarias para los veteranos de la II
Guerra le dio a muchos una oportunidad que de otra manera no hubieran
tenido. Ese programa mejoró radicalmente la educación superior, al aumentar
drásticamente la competencia por estudiantes. Los veteranos podían usar sus
becas para asistir a universidades privadas o públicas que los aceptaran.
Esos fondos balancearon los subsidios recibidos por las universidades
estatales, forzándolas a mejorar para poder competir.
<P>
 Becas y vales para niños de los barrios pobres los ayudaría en la misma
forma en que se beneficiaron los veteranos de la guerra. Entonces gozarían
de una mayor selección de opciones educativas y no estarían obligados a
recibir una educación mediocre ofrecida por un monopolio estatal.
<P>
 Aun con un sistema de vales, muchos estudiantes -incluyendo lo muy buenos-
permanecerían en escuelas públicas si estas mejoraran. Y sin duda mejorarán
si tienen que enfrentar la competencia del sector privado. ©

MEXICO: LA REVOLUCION ECONOMICA POSIBLE
</H2>
Roberto Blum*
<br>
<p>
CIUDAD DE MEXICO (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>)
 (AIPE).- Proponer que la economía mexicana crezca a una
tasa de 5% anual, cubriendo la demanda de empleo de apenas un millón de
mexicanos al año, es una muestra de, por lo menos, falta de imaginación. Los
datos oficiales señalan que el empleo informal llegó al 21,7% de la
población económicamente activa, unos 8 millones de mexicanos.  Pero son
unos 20 millones los mexicanos que están desempleados o que trabajan en la
economía informal. Estos requieren hoy un empleo productivo en la economía
formal. Un crecimiento a tasas tan mediocres como plantean los planes
oficiales es inaceptable.  
<P>
                Los "tigres y dragones," países asiáticos con crecimientos
sostenidos cercanos a 10% durante décadas, lo lograron gracias a la
capacidad de sus gobiernos de movilizar a esas sociedades en torno a un
objetivo de crecimiento acelerado que produjo resultados tangibles en el
bienestar de las familias y de los individuos. Los gobiernos incentivaron la
disciplina y el esfuerzo, lo cual de inmediato se tradujo en beneficios
substanciales en el nivel de vida. 
<P>
                En Singapur hoy, 30 años después, casi todos los ciudadanos
son propietarios de su vivienda y han alcanzado niveles de bienestar
semejantes a los de Europa Occidental. China, con 1.200 millones de
habitantes, lleva más de 15 años creciendo a tasas verdaderamente
increíbles. Hay regiones tan pobladas como México que crecen al 25% anual.
Su secreto fue permitir que el esfuerzo realizado por cada campesino, por
cada obrero, por cada empresario lo beneficie directamente a él y a su
familia.  Las reformas del agro chino de 1978 se tradujeron en tangible
bienestar para las familias a partir de ese mismo año.  Sólo de esa manera,
los gobiernos pueden contar con la confianza de sus pueblos.
<P>
                En México, el gobierno del presidente Zedillo está logrando
estabilizar la economía. Sin duda esto es muy importante, pero no es
suficiente. Si crecemos en los programas minimalistas del gobierno, los
niveles de bienestar perdidos en 1995 no se recuperarán así sino hasta el
año 2007.  Otra generación sacrificada.  Otra oportunidad que desperdicia el
gobierno en recuperar la confianza del pueblo. Y sin embargo, esto no
tendría que ser así. No estamos fatalmente condenados a ello. México podría
iniciar un crecimiento acelerado a partir de 1997 y traducir ese crecimiento
en bienestar para todos los mexicanos. Todavía tenemos algunas cartas de
triunfo en la mano, todavía no se acaba el juego.
<P>
                El general Lázaro Cárdenas -el "tata"- capitalizó a los
campesinos.  Les dio la posesión de un pedazo de tierra. Así inició la
industrialización del país. La reforma agraria y la expropiación del
petróleo de los años 30 generaron entre los mexicanos la "ilusión del
cambio" que sostuvo políticamente al PRI durante 60 años.  Salinas -el
"bueno"- disminuyó la inflación, domó la crisis y, sin duda, repartió
bienestar y esperanza entre los más pobres con sus programas de
"solidaridad."  Entre todos los mexicanos generó una "ilusión del cambio" y
nos hizo ver la posibilidad de entrar al Primer Mundo. Con las reformas al
Artículo 27 de la Constitución se dio fin a la reforma agraria, liquidando
el "ejido" o régimen de propiedad comunitaria que negaba a los campesinos la
posibilidad de vender, arrendar, hipotecar o transmitir por herencia las
parcelas a sus hijos. Los programas Procampo y Procede iniciaron una
trascendente, aunque incompleta, "capitalización" del país.
<P>
                Aunque tarde, el presidente Zedillo todavía podría generar
la "ilusión del cambio" y recuperar la confianza de los mexicanos.  Todavía
podría nacionalizar -hacer propiedad efectiva de los mexicanos- los bienes
que la burocracia gubernamental y sus aliados corporativistas nos ha
expropiado a todos.  El petróleo, por ejemplo, lo usufructúa para su
provecho particular la burocracia y el sindicato de Pemex, sin que los
mexicanos reciban ningún beneficio. Las empresas estatales y sus activos
deben pasar a manos de sus verdaderos dueños, todos los mexicanos, mediante
la distribución gratuita a cada ciudadano de los certificados que amparan su
propiedad.  De un plumazo, Zedillo -el "estadista"- podría capitalizar a
todas las familias mexicanas con unos cuarenta mil dólares (contando sólo
las reservas petroleras), cumplir con su promesa de bienestar para todos y
generar la "ilusión de cambio" que nos permitiría comenzar a crecer a tasas
que los asiáticos nos han probado ser posibles de alcanzar. ©

NICARAGUA: NUEVO CAPITULO

<p>
WASHINGTON(<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>)
 (AIPE).- Arnoldo Alemán, ex alcalde de Managua y candidato de la
Alianza Liberal, derrotó fácilmente al ex presidente sandinista, Daniel
Ortega, en las elecciones del 20 de octubre. La gran victoria de Alemán fue
una sorpresa, ya que las encuestas indicaban estar cabeza a cabeza. La
segunda derrota de Ortega en cinco años es indicativa de que los
nicaragüenses no desean regresar al pasado sandinista. Pero,
lamentablemente, los problemas del país son muy graves para ser resueltos
por una elección.
<P>
 Lo que estaba de por medio en estas elecciones era más sobre el pasado que
sobre el futuro. La victoria de Alemán es un rechazo al gobierno de la
presidenta Violeta Chamorro, no sólo por su incapacidad en reactivar la
economía y detener la caída del nivel de vida sino también por su renuencia
a liquidar varios aspectos del legado sandinista. De hecho, se pueden
describir al menos tres de los últimos cinco años de gobierno como un caso
clásico de cohabitación, con los sandinistas al control de las fuerzas
armadas y de la policía, a la vez que ejercían una considerable influencia,
tras bastidores, con arreglos sucios y privados con miembros del gobierno de
Chamorro.
<P>
 A raíz de su victoria en 1990, a la Sra. Chamorro se le pidió exterminar el
virus sandinista, pero ella prefirió el camino de la reconciliación y
pacificación. Ahora que los sandinistas fueron nuevamente barridos
electoralmente, esa política de la presidenta Chamorro luce mejor.
<P>
 Un logro innegable ha sido la desmilitarización de la sociedad. Unos 22.000
contras entregaron sus armas y el ejército ha sido reducido de 96.000
hombres a 13.500. También ha habido una reducción paralela de los gastos
militares que en 1990 consumían 40% del presupuesto nacional. En parte, eso
ha ayudado a reducir los déficit del presupuesto y la astronómica inflación.
Durante los últimos cinco años, Nicaragua ha vivido bajo un clima sin
precedente de libertad.
<P>
 Lamentablemente, los errores han sido tan grandes como los logros. Casi la
mitad de los préstamos prometidos a los contras y de los documentos de
propiedad de las tierra no han sido concedidos. Como resultado, repeticiones
de la violencia guerrillera han costado la vida de más de mil nicaragüenses.
Pero el problema más serio es el estancamiento económico, sufriendo la mitad
de la población de desempleo crónico.
<P>
 La crisis proviene de la década de gobierno marxista que precipitó una fuga
masiva de capitales y de los profesionales con la habilidad de gerenciar. La
mayoría se fueron a Estados Unidos, donde sus hijos se han convertido en
residentes permanentes. Tomará un par de generaciones volver a crear el
capital humano que Nicaragua perdió.
<P>
 Pero el pobre récord económico del gobierno de Violeta Chamorro no es toda
culpa de sus antecesores. En su campaña electoral de 1990, Chamorro había
prometido revisar las expropiaciones masivas efectuadas por los sandinistas
en propiedades tanto urbanas como del campo. Nunca lo encaró y hasta bloqueó
las iniciativas de la Legislatura Nacional de al menos pagar una
compensación a los expropiados.
<P>
 Sin una clara definición de los derechos de propiedad, tanto el capital
nacional como el extranjero le seguirán sacando el cuerpo a la que fue una
de las más vigorosas economías en América Central.
<P>
 El fracaso de encarar la situación ha envenenado la atmósfera nicaragüense
y desde hace un año más de cien mil habitantes urbanos viven bajo la amenaza
de ser desalojados por los dueños que han regresado a reclamar sus
propiedades. Por otra parte, 24.000 demandas relacionadas a la confiscación
de tierras siguen sin decidirse. Una ley de Estabilización de la Propiedad,
promulgada en noviembre de 1995, trató de partir la torta, aceptando la
reforma agraria sandinista, pero requiriendo la compensación sobre
propiedades urbanas. No sorprendió a nadie que los propietarios no aceptasen
ser compensados con bonos de la semiprivatizada compañía de teléfonos.
<P>
 Los que apoyaron a Alemán fueron tanto los que habían perdido sus
propiedades como los que están inconformes ante la ausencia de oportunidades
económicas. La campaña de Alemán también resaltó el favoritismo familiar en
la distribución de cargos y contratos gubernamentales.
<P>
 Pero hay más que razones políticas y económicas en la victoria de Alemán.
Hijo de una familia humilde, se ha sobrepuesto a prejuicios sociales
alcanzando el éxito como empresario y luego como alcalde de la capital. Por
el contrario, quienes rodean a la Sra. Chamorro pertenencen a la
aristocracia tradicional nicaragüense.
<P>
 El programa de Alemán incluye la revitalización de la economía a través de
préstamos a los agricultores y a los empresarios pequeños. También promete
invertir en la abandonada infraestructura de carreteras, puentes y demás
obras públicas. Pero lo que Alemán ofrecía distinto a Ortega son buenas
relaciones con Estados Unidos, lo cual los nicaragüenses -con razón o sin
ella- piensan que es la clave en la recuperación económica.
<P>
 Lo nicas tampoco han olvidado "la piñata", la repartición de propiedades
gubernamentales durante las últimas semanas del gobierno sandinista. Así le
pusieron la mano a propiedades que algunos estiman en $200 millones y otros
en $2.000 millones, repartidas entre unos cinco mil sandinistas, en su
mayoría funcionarios altos del régimen. De esa manera Ortega creó una
"burguesía revolucionaria" a la mexicana, pero al mismo tiempo produjo una
inmensa brecha entre los sandinistas privilegiados y los comunes y corrientes. 
<P>
 Ortega trató de proyectar una nueva imagen, vistiéndose bien y eliminando
del himno sandinista aquello de que el gringo es "el peor enemigo de la
humanidad". Pero los nicas no creyeron en su repentino pluralismo, indicando
que sigue viajando frecuentemente a Cuba y que no hay evidencia de
democracia interna en su partido. De hecho, el partido se dividió al
separarse el ex vicepresidente Sergio Ramírez. Es significativo que la
mayoría de los legisladores sandinistas se han ido con Ramírez.
<P>
 La política nica hoy se caracteriza por su división en tres "familias", en
sí fraccionadas: el sandinismo, el antisandinismo y el grupo más pequeño que
puede designarse como conservadora y que apoyó a Chamorro. Más del 60% es
antisandinista, pero entre ellos algunos quieren un rompimiento con el
pasado y otros favorecen un gobierno en manos de las mismas familias que han
dominado la política durante un siglo. La victoria de Alemán es importante
al representar el deseo por una nueva síntesis.
<P>
 Alemán se enfrenta a todas las patologías de la región: radical desigualdad
y la tendencia a confundir los bienes privados y públicos. No es fácil ser
optimista, pero al menos el electorado escogió bien. ©

PEMEX EMPOBRECE A MEXICO
</H2>
Isaac Katz*
<br>
<p>
CIUDAD DE MEXICO 
(<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>)
(AIPE).- Gracias a Pemex, el monopolio petrolero estatal,
los mexicanos somos y seremos más pobres. Los accidentes mortales ocurridos
en las instalaciones de Pemex en Plátano, Cacao, Cactus, Guadalajara, San
Juan Ixhuatepec, etc. son eventos que nos han empobrecido y cuya factura
vamos a pagar todos los mexicanos con un menor ingreso presente y futuro. La
ineptitud con la cual se ha manejado esta empresa a lo largo de los años,
las prebendas de que gozan los empleados sindicalizados, la corrupción que
tradicionalmente ha imperado en los contratos de adquisición de insumos, la
venta de plazas laborales y todos los demás adornos que caracterizan a
Pemex, implican un aprovechamiento muy ineficiente de la riqueza petrolera
mexicana y por lo mismo una generación de ingresos derivados de la misma muy
inferior al potencial.
<P>
Los diferentes accidentes que recientemente han ocurrido en las
instalaciones de Pemex reflejan, en última instancia, la falta de definición
de los derechos de propiedad que caracterizan a cualquier empresa del
gobierno y que por lo mismo se traducen en una administración y operación
ineficiente, cuyo costo todos pagamos. Entre las muchas campañas
publicitarias de Pemex, tratando inútilmente de mejorar su deteriorada
imagen, había una que afirmaba que "Pemex es de todos los mexicanos". 
<P>
Nada
más falso. Pemex no es de todos los mexicanos, sino solamente de algunos,
particularmente del sindicato petrolero, que con todas las prebendas que
tienen en su contrato colectivo de trabajo obtienen un ingreso superior al
valor de su productividad. Por lo mismo, si el gobierno quisiera que Pemex
fuese de todos los mexicanos, tendría que volver a expropiar el petróleo,
pero esta vez quitándoselo al sindicato y privatizándolo mediante una oferta
pública de acciones en la cual todos los mexicanos puedan participar.
El gobierno y la propia administración de Pemex han señalado que no se
cuentan con los recursos requeridos para la modernización y ampliación de
las plantas petroquímicas de la empresa paraestatal, por lo que propusieron
la venta del 49% de las acciones de las plantas. Si antes se percibía como
poco probable que este mecanismo indujera al sector privado a asociarse con
Pemex, sobretodo por la obsolescencia de las plantas y la presencia del
propio sindicato, después del último accidente, que muestra las
ineficiencias internas y el lamentable estado de la empresa, la
probabilidad de participación privada es todavía menor. 
<P>
Se sigue insistiendo que Pemex es y seguirá siendo una empresa del estado.
Para muchos, ser propietarios de chatarra nos hace ser más soberanos. Por la
forma en que hemos manejado nuestra inmensa riqueza petrolera, los mexicanos
somos más pobres y también lo serán nuestros hijos. ©

INMIGRACION Y DROGAS: JUSTOS POR PECADORES

INMIGRACION Y DROGAS: JUSTOS POR PECADORES

Agustín Navarro*
<br>
<p>
CIUDAD DE MEXICO
(<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>)
 (AIPE).- La inmigración en Estados Unidos sigue
experimentando enormes presiones políticas provenientes de posturas
aislacionistas y puritanas tanto de republicanos y demócratas como de la
bala perdida texana, Mr. Perot.  Esto ha provocado que paguen "justos por
pecadores" en lo que se antoja como un "Juicio Final" fronterizo de
indocumentados y en particular de residentes de origen mexicano.
<P>
                Por otra parte, existe gran preocupación en México respecto
a las reacciones del Congreso y del Ejecutivo de Estados Unidos, al usar
políticas financieras y comerciales hacia México como medidas de presión
para forzar al gobierno mexicano a combatir el narcotráfico, sin ofrecer
acciones recíprocas -en calidad y cantidad- por parte y dentro de Estados
Unidos.
<P>
                Desde la posición norteamericana, el campo de batalla de las
drogas debe permanecer en territorio extranjero: México, Colombia, etc. Los
narcóticos -desde la perspectiva migratoria- es ahora el problema más
preocupante que afecta el cruce ilegal. La contaminación de la inmigración
con drogas es extensa. Cada día más y más trabajadores indocumentados son
forzados por el crimen organizado de ambos lados de la frontera a llevar
drogas, lo cual ha sustituido las cuotas que antes se pagaban a los coyotes.
<P>
                La operación de los "Carteles de Inmigración" -homólogos de
los "Carteles de Drogas"- coordinados desde Centro y Sudamérica es un nuevo
y extremadamente virulento factor en el aumento de la criminalidad en las
ciudades fronterizas de México. El dinero y las drogas involucradas en esta
extensa operación están corrompiendo a la policía, a los funcionarios
aduanales y a oficiales de migración de ambos países. Sólo basta para
confirmar todo esto darle un vistazo a los testimonios que han salido a
relucir en el juicio del narcotraficante García Abrego.
<P>
                Un creciente número de otrora inocentes trabajadores
indocumentados están siendo encarcelados en prisiones federales
estadounidenses y cumplen largas sentencias por delitos de narcotráfico.
Evidentemente, la inmigración ya no es tan solo un problema interno del país
recipiente.  No es materia sólo de suprimir servicios públicos a los
inmigrantes. No es cuestión de negar educación, salud y asistencia a los
hijos de inmigrantes. Se ha convertido en tema de gran importancia en la
política local de ambas naciones. Es un problema que concierne a los
intereses de seguridad nacional tanto de México como de Estados Unidos.
<P>
                El crimen organizado se metió en el nuevo negocio del
tráfico de seres humanos y tiene que ser despojado de los incentivos que
ofrece el mercado de drogas más grande del mundo.  Las drogas llegan a
Estados Unidos por invitación (por la demanda interna), igual como los
trabajadores foráneos.
<P>
	La respuesta efectiva a la inmigración ilegal es una combinación de mercados
más libres y flujos legales de personas altamente motivadas. Así se evitará
que nuestros trabajadores migratorios caigan en las manos del crimen
organizado, pagando justos por pecadores.
<P>
                Es evidente que la regulación y los acuerdos internacionales
en materia de narcóticos están creando inmensos mercados y privilegios
monopólicos al crimen organizado. No hay nada más dañino y atentatorio a los
intereses nacionales que la contaminación criminal de la que son víctimas
los esforzados compatriotas que van en busca de oportunidades que México, su
patria, todavía les niega. ©

EL FRACASO DEL RECICLAJE DE LA BASURA

EL FRACASO DEL RECICLAJE DE LA BASURA
</H2>
Sylvia Pasquier*
<br>
<p>
NUEVA YORK
(<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>)
 (AIPE).- La creciente preocupación por el manejo de la basura y
los desperdicios tomó auge en 1987, cuando una gran barcaza, la Mobro 4000,
navegó miles de kilómetros tratando de encontrar un lugar donde le
permitieran descargar la basuras producida por los habitantes de Long
Island, en Estados Unidos. A partir de entonces, Nueva York y otras grandes
ciudades tratan de determinar la mejor manera de manejar la basura.
 El "reciclaje" de la basura ha tenido gran aceptación como proceso para
obtener beneficios económicos y proteger el medio ambiente. Pero una
revisión de los resultados obtenidos en Nueva York nos deja ver el gran
trecho que existe entre la propaganda oficial y los verdaderos resultados.
<P>
                La ciudad de Nueva York fue pionera en 1988 en promover el
reciclaje como el mejor método de disponer de los desechos, ejemplo seguido
luego por varias ciudades europeas, principalmente en Alemania. Winston
Porter fue administrador asistente de la EPA (Agencia de Protección
Ambiental de Estados Unidos), dependencia gubernamental que fijó una meta de
25% como cantidad a reciclar de la basura. Hoy Porter es asesor de varias
ciudades, a las cuales aconseja que abandonen tales metas tan poco realistas.
<P>
                Cada vez que un vehículo recolector de basura completa su
carga de botellas y de latas recogidas de las aceras de Nueva York, la
ciudad pierde dinero. El programa de reciclaje consume recursos, requiere
una administración especial y una campaña continua para enseñar a la gente
lo que debe hacer con docenas de diferentes productos: reciclar botellas de
leche pero no cartones de leche; periódicos sí pero no el papel utilizado en
la construcción, etc.
<P>
                A pesar de que el programa de reciclaje lleva varios años,
la mayoría de los habitantes de Nueva York no comprenden todas las reglas
vigentes. El programa también requiere de agentes que inspeccionen los
desperdicios y distribuyan notificaciones de multas. Sobre todo, obliga a
utilizar muchos más vehículos y mucho más personal que antes, cuando no se
reciclaba.
<P>
                Recolectar una tonelada de desperdicios y basura reciclable
en la ciudad de Nueva York es tres veces más caro que recolectar una
tonelada de basura no reciclable. Por cada tonelada de vidrio, plásticos y
metales que el vehículo entrega a una empresa privada de reciclaje, la
ciudad de Nueva York gasta actualmente $200 más de lo que gastaría
transportando basura a una zona de relleno municipal.
<P>
                Los directores del proyecto esperaban recuperar este costo
adicional vendiendo los materiales obtenidos, pero su precio jamás se acercó
siquiera al costo del manejo. Las empresas privadas de reciclaje exigen,
además, honorarios por su trabajo, ya que sus costos de procesamiento de la
basura son mayores que los eventuales precios de venta de los materiales
reciclados. Por este motivo, la ciudad habiendo ya invertido $200 por cada
tonelada de material recogido debe pagar otros $40 para deshacerse de éste.
<P>
                El programa de reciclaje le cuesta a la ciudad de Nueva York
unos $100 millones al año y esta cifra solamente incluye el dinero
proveniente del presupuesto municipal. Hay que agregar el costo escondido de
todo el trabajo efectuado gratis por los habitantes de la ciudad en
cooperación con el programa de reciclaje. Recientemente, un estudiante de la
Universidad de Columbia sumó el trabajo de una semana, siguiendo al pie de
la letra los reglamentos municipales. Le tomaron 8 minutos a la semana
escoger y llevar al sótano del edificio donde vive dos kilos de latas y
botellas. Si la ciudad tuviera que pagar personal para que realizara ese
trabajo, costaría otros $800 por cada tonelada de reciclaje.
<P>
                Si calculamos también el costo del espacio asignado para
guardar todo el material reciclable hasta tanto pasen a recogerlo, según los
precios actuales de la vivienda y asignando sólo un metro cuadrado por
familia, este costo alcanza otros $2.000 por tonelada. Por lo tanto, el
costo verdadero de una tonelada de material reciclable es más de $3.000.
Cuando los burócratas y expertos ambientales hablan maravillas de los
programas de reciclaje, no toman en cuenta sus horribles costos. Si
ignoramos la relación costo/beneficio de los programas gubernamentales, todo
suena lindo, bueno y deseable. ©

TELARAÑAS MINISTERIALES

Paul Craig Roberts*
<br>
<p>
WASHINGTON
(<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>)
 (AIPE).- Las renuncias masivas en el gabinete del presidente
Clinton nos permiten pensar que las políticas de su segunda administración
pueden ser más equilibradas, pero para que ello se logre tendrán que haber
también muchos cambios burocráticos por debajo del nivel ministerial.
<P>
 Los ministros reciben toda la atención pública, pero el poder operativo
está en manos de sus asistentes, entre quienes han proliferado los
extremistas que piensan que los valores e instituciones de Estados Unidos
son discriminatorios y deben ser reformados.
<P>
 Los burócratas nombrados por Clinton ven discriminación racial y sexual en
todos los rincones de nuestra sociedad. La encuentran en la institución del
matrimonio, en los valores religiosos tradicionales, en primas de seguros y
en las tasas de intereses hipotecarios basadas en  los riesgos, en academias
militares fundadas hace 157 años y en el comportamiento normal de los niños.
<P>
 ¿Recuerda el caso del niño de seis años que fue suspendido por "acoso
sexual" al haber besado en la mejilla a una niñita? Fue el resultado de
regulaciones emitidas por Norma Cantu, vice ministra de Educación para
derechos civiles. Otro logro de la Sra. Cantu es la imposición de "equidad
sexual" para destruir muchos programas de atletismo masculino en las
universidades. La Sra. Cantu exige un "equilibrio de género" en los
programas deportivos y como las mujeres no juegan fútbol americano, otros
deportes han tenido que ser eliminados para mantener la representación
proporcional entre varones y hembras.
<P>
 La Sra. Nan Hunter, consultora jurídica asistente del Departamento de Salud
y Servicios Humanos, antes dirigía el programa de Derechos de Lesbianas y
'Gays' de la Unión Americana de Libertades Civiles. Ella considera al
matrimonio como otra institución discriminatoria más y busca eliminar "la
estructura de género en todo matrimonio".
<P>
 Deval Patrick, vice ministro de Justicia para derechos humanos, ha abusado
de su cargo en tal forma que fue denunciado por la senadora demócrata de
Illinois, Carol Moseley-Braun, por sus "técnicas tipo Gestapo", aplastando a
ciudadanos y comunidades. Patrick inició una demanda de discriminación
contra un banco en Chevy Chase, Maryland, obligando al banco a través de una
campaña de prensa, protestas y manifestaciones de grupos interesados a
conceder préstamos con intereses por debajo de sus costos a "minorías" y a
establecer sucursales según criterios raciales.
<P>
 Cuando los ciudadanos del pueblo de Bakersfield, California, se opusieron a
la instalación de una casa para enfermos mentales en su barrio residencial,
Patrick los denunció por discriminación e inició un juicio federal contra
ellos, sabiendo perfectamente que el bolsillo del gobierno federal es mucho
más profundo que el de esa pobre gente que defiende su barrio. La alcalde de
San Diego declaró ante una comisión del Senado que sufrir los ataques de
Patrick es como vivir en la antigua Unión Soviética. 
<P>
 Fue Patrick quien logró destruir la tradición de las academias militares
Citadel y Virginia Military Institute, fundadas en 1842 y 1839, obligándolas
a cambiar su cultura y a aceptar mujeres. Patrick predica a abogados tanto
dentro como fuera del gobierno que los derechos de "las minorías preferidas"
están por encima de los derechos constitucionales de los que no han sido
designados como minorías.
<P>
 Patrick renunció y busca un trabajo mejor remunerado. Buena suerte. Pero el
Senado republicano tiene que hacer un mejor trabajo esta vez, rechazando
nombramientos de payasos estrafalarios a cargos claves de la administración. ©

EL NUEVO PROTECCIONISMO DE ESTADOS UNIDOS

WAHINGTON
(<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>)
 (AIPE).- En la cumbre de la Organización Mundial del Comercio
(OMC) que se celebra actualmente en Singapur, los Estados Unidos y otras
naciones industrializadas están insistiendo en la "armonización" de
regulaciones laborales con los países en desarrollo, como condición para
cualquier futuro acuerdo de libre comercio. Los países en vías de
desarrollo, incluyendo los Tigres Asiáticos, se oponen.
<P>
 El establecimiento de normas laborales mínimas a nivel mundial es parte del
esfuerzo por crear una serie de preceptos comerciales supuestamente justos,
con el fin de "nivelar el campo de juego". Con tales normas, los líderes
sindicales y otros grupos de presión de las naciones industrializadas
intentan que los trabajadores de los países ricos sean menos vulnerables a
la competencia de la mano de obra barata extranjera.
<P>
 Pero, en el fondo, esto no es más que una nueva forma de proteccionismo. Y
el proteccionismo, al igual que el mono, aunque se vista de seda,
proteccionismo se queda. La vulnerabilidad de los trabajadores en los países
industrializados no se debe al mayor volumen de comercio con los países en
vías de desarrollo sino a políticas macroeconómicas erróneas. Por ejemplo,
en Europa Occidental el seguro de desempleo es demasiado generoso,
aumentando los costos laborales de tal manera que la tasa de contratación
permanente es muy baja.
<P>
 La noción del comercio "justo" implica una igualdad de resultados, es
decir, una balanza comercial equilibrada. Pero son los individuos, no las
naciones, los que comercian entre sí. Y la razón por la que intercambian
bienes y servicios es que esperan beneficiarse del intercambio. Un criterio
más apropiado sería determinar si las reglas comerciales (que no es lo mismo
que las regulaciones laborales) se pueden aplicar con igualdad y de manera
general a todos aquellos que comercian.  Es más, éste sería un rol legítimo
de la OMC.
<P>
 La famosa cláusula social, que impondría unos derechos laborales mínimos,
elevaría el costo laboral de los trabajadores en los países en desarrollo
muy por encima del rendimiento de su trabajo, creando automáticamente un
desempleo generalizado. Como explica la economista guatemalteca Lucy
Martínez-Mont: "El privar a los países en vías de desarrollo, incluso con
las mejores intenciones, del capital y del empleo necesarios para erradicar
las condiciones de pobreza que nos afligen desde hace siglos solamente
asegurará la perpetuación indefinida de dicha miseria."
<P>
 Una de las claves para salir de la pobreza es la apertura de los mercados y
a medida que el nivel de vida sube, los trabajadores son capaces de
satisfacer otros deseos menos importantes que el mínimo sustento, como son
mejores condiciones de trabajo y un medio ambiente más limpio. Nada de eso
se logra por medio de decretos supranacionales.
<P>
 La agenda estadounidense en la OMC es especialmente peligrosa para los
países en vías de desarrollo porque de lograr imponer la cláusula social en
las reglas multilaterales del comercio se paralizarían los avances de los
países pobres, además de perjudicar gravemente a los consumidores de todo el
mundo.
<P>
 La libertad de los individuos de disponer de su propiedad como les plazca y
de participar en intercambios voluntarios con otros individuos -ya sean
estos de la misma ciudad o de otro país- es una característica fundamental
del sistema de libre empresa. Los excesos regulatorios que han conducido al
estancamiento económico y a una mayor dependencia del Estado en muchas
naciones industrializadas son una restricción de esa libertad y una
imposición que los países en vías de desarrollo no necesitan para nada. ©

LA VERDADERA MORAL
</H2>
Robert A. Sirico*
<br>
<p>
GRAND RAPIDS, MICHIGAN
(<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>)
 (AIPE).- Los dirigentes empresariales tienen un
interés personal en promover la comprensión pública de la economía de
mercado. Sin embargo, ellos pronto se rinden cuando la oposición
izquierdista se envuelve a sí misma en un manto religioso.
<P>
 No tiene que ser así. Veamos el caso de la firma Briggs & Stratton (B&S) de
Milwaukee, fabricante de pequeños motores. En diciembre de 1994 fue atacada
editorialmente por los medios izquierdistas católicos por despedir a
trabajadores. La empresa respondió con una demanda de difamación y una
campaña en defensa de la economía de mercado.
<P>
 Thomas Fox, director del National Catholic Reporter, identificó a tres
altos ejecutivos de B&S como católicos, acusándolos de "haberse desviado de
las enseñanzas sociales de la Iglesia". El periódico acusó a los tres de
"ceguera moral" ante la maldad de los despidos.
<P>
 El artículo asumía que es inmoral que una empresa mude sus operaciones a
otra parte, aunque ello sea necesario para su supervivencia. Según el código
moral de este periódico católico, los patronos deben garantizarle a la
fuerza laboral actual sus altos salarios de por vida, se estén ellos ganando
o no los sueldos.
<P>
 Veamos lo que pasó en B&S. En 1983 sus motores eran manufacturados en
Milwaukee por miembros del sindicato. Con una penetración de 65% en el
mercado de cortadoras de grama en Estados Unidos, B&S pagaba un promedio de
salarios 30% más altos que la competencia. Las relaciones con el sindicato
eran amistosas.
<P>
 Con una posición privilegiada en el mercado, la empresa podía complacer la
mayoría de las exigencias del sindicato, lo cual se financiaba con precios
más altos de sus motores. Pero esto eventualmente atrajo la competencia de
otros fabricantes y de empresas japonesas. La gerencia se dio cuenta que
tenía que realizar cambios para mantener sus ventas.
<P>
 Fred Stratton, el presidente de la empresa, explicó al sindicato la
necesidad de congelar salarios y de pagar menos a los nuevos empleados, a la
vez de mayor flexibilidad en las operaciones de la planta. El sindicato
declaró una huelga que duró tres meses, provocando una crisis, al no poder
la empresa cumplir con los pedidos de sus clientes, quienes comenzaron a
cambiarse a otros proveedores.
<P>
 B&S respondió mudando parte de la producción a Murray, Kentucky y a Poplar
Bluff, Missouri, empleando mano de obra más barata. No se trataba de
"avaricia empresarial" sino de intransigencia sindical y el grueso de la
producción permaneció en Milwaukee.
<P>
 Las cosas empeoraron. En 1989 B&S sufrió pérdidas por $20 millones, pero
todavía insistía en quedarse en Milwaukee. La gerencia convenció a los
líderes sindicales de aceptar una congelación salarial de cuatro años,
prometiendo no mudar las operaciones en tres años y medio. El sindicato
procedió a violar sistemáticamente el espíritu del acuerdo, rehusó aportar
trabajadores para nuevos departamentos e instrumentaron una "operación
tortuga" ilegal.
<P>
 Ante la creciente competencia y mayores aumentos en sus costos, B&S dio un
preaviso de un año a dos mil de sus trabajadores y comenzó a utilizar
crecientemente sus instalaciones en áreas donde pagaba menores sueldos. Si
el periódico católico hubiese realmente querido ayudar a los trabajadores,
no ha debido culpar a los gerentes sino decirle a los trabajadores que
aceptaran las realidades económicas y colaboraran con su empresa en reducir
costos. Ha debido recordarle a los trabajadores que también ellos tienen una
obligación moral: dar un día de trabajo por el salario recibido y no
perjudicar a la empresa donde trabajan.
<P>
 Pero gente como Thomas Fox y el resto de la izquierda religiosa les
interesa menos ayudar a los trabajadores que hacer propaganda
antiempresarial. Dada las dificultades, los ejecutivos de B&S, actuaron como
buenos católicos, satisfaciendo a sus clientes y creando puestos de trabajo.
Fue el sindicato y el periódico católico los que violaron la justicia social
y los preceptos morales. ©

EL VOTO LATINO EN LAS ELECCIONES AMERICANAS
</H2>
John Sweeney*
<br>
<p>
WASHINGTON
(<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>)
 (AIPE).- El voto latino, por mucho tiempo una fuerza silente en
las elecciones presidenciales estadounidenses, el 5 de noviembre acudió a
las urnas de votación en cantidades sin precedentes en California, Florida,
Nueva York y otros estados claves, ayudando la victoria del presidente
Clinton, en momentos cuando la proporción de votantes fue la más baja en una
elección presidencial desde 1924.
<P>
 Los votantes latinos también produjeron la victoria de candidatos
demócratas en contiendas peliagudas al Congreso y las legislaturas
estadales. Encuestas postelectorales en California, donde vive la mitad de
los latinos en este país, muestran que votaron por Clinton y demás
candidatos demócratas en proporción de 3 a 1. En estados como Texas, Nueva
York y Arizona, donde suelen ganar los republicanos, los latinos se
inclinaron por candidatos demócratas en proporción de hasta 17 a 1.
<P>
 El voto masivo de los latinos en parte tuvo que ver con la aceleración de
las concesiones de nacionalidad por parte de la administración Clinton, que
alcanzó a más de un millón de nuevos ciudadanos en el último año y, también,
por agresivas campañas para que salieran a votar en las comunidades latinas.
<P>
 Sin embargo, la razón principal de que el voto latino se haya inclinado
fuertemente hacia los demócratas es la percepción generalizada del Partido
Republicano como antiinmigrante y antilatino. El Partido Republicano
enfrenta serios problemas con los votantes latinos. Al igual que con todas
las inmigraciones anteriores, los inmigrantes que se nacionalizan tienden a
ser más jóvenes, menos afluentes y con menos educación que la población en
general.
<P>
Las encuestas muestran que los latinos son firmes creyentes en la familia,
el trabajo duro, la fe religiosa y la seguridad jurídica, exactamente los
valores sociales que predican los republicanos conservadores. Que hayan
repudiado a los republicanos en proporción aplastante obligará a los líderes
de ese partido a reconsiderar su posición sobre inmigración.
<P>
 Una de las razones por las que Bob Dole escogió a Jack Kemp como candidato
a la vicepresidencia fue por la decidida posición de éste a favor de la
inmigración, el comercio hemisférico y de relaciones más estrechas con
América Latina.
<P>
 Pero la retórica antimexicana de Pat Buchanan, las reformas a la
beneficencia social que discriminan contra los inmigrantes legales
instrumentadas por el Congreso republicano y el referendo antiinmigración
apoyado agresivamente por Pete Wilson, gobernador republicano de California,
convencieron a la mayoría de los latinos que el Partido Republicano no
representa sus valores como ciudadanos de Estados Unidos.
<P>
 Este brinco al Partido Demócrata ocurre justamente cuando está creciendo
rápidamente el voto latino. Entre 1992 y 1996, el voto latino en California
creció de 7% a 10%, de 10% a 16% en Texas y de 11% a 12% en Florida.
<P>
 Las tendencias demográficas señalan la creciente importancia del voto
latino durante los próximos 12 años. Según la oficina del censo, antes de 30
años los latinos conformarán el 25% de la población de Estados Unidos,
mientras que la minoría negra se mantendrá entre 12% y 14%.
<P>
 El presidente Clinton obtuvo el voto latino sin competencia alguna. La
decisión poco inteligente de los líderes republicanos en cuanto a atacar la
inmigración les explotó en la cara, ayudando con su retórica antiinmigrante
a los candidatos demócratas. ©

VENEZUELA: TERRORISMO JUDICIAL

VENEZUELA: TERRORISMO JUDICIAL

Nicomedes Zuloaga*

<p>
CARACAS
(<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>)
 (AIPE).- La seguridad jurídica es el cumplimiento de normas legales
que garantizan la resolución pacífica de conflictos entre individuos, a la
vez que la existencia de jueces confiables que aplican las normas legales.
La Constitución venezolana contiene todas las garantías ciudadanas del mundo
civilizado. Teóricamente tenemos una legislación que hace presumir la
existencia de un Estado de Derecho, de una seguridad jurídica. Pero en la
práctica esa legislación no se aplica si no te haces "amigo del juez".
La ausencia de jueces confiables tiene consecuencias gravísimas para la
sociedad. Si en los juicios civiles es grave esa situación, más grave aún se
torna en el caso de jueces penales porque los ciudadanos quedan sujetos al
llamado 'terrorismo judicial'.
<P>
 La ausencia de jueces penales confiables conduce a lo ocurrido en otros
países de América Latina, una tendencia a hacerse justicia por sí mismo,
cuya expresión extrema son los llamados 'escuadrones de la muerte' que
proliferan por la desesperación de la ciudadanía ante la impunidad judicial
de los malhechores que regresan a la calle libres, pocos días después de
cometido el delito. 
<P>
                  La falta de seguridad jurídica incide dramáticamente en la
economía. No hay desarrollo económico sin inversiones que nos hagan más
productivos y no hay inversión sin seguridad jurídica.  Desarrollo económico
y seguridad jurídica son un matrimonio indisoluble. 	
<P>
 La legislación penal venezolana y especialmente el secreto sumarial son las
principales fuentes de la corrupción judicial y hoy se ofrecen las más
variadas soluciones, muchas de ellas no encaminadas a restaurar la seguridad
jurídica sino más bien para lograr que los "reformadores" sustituyan a los
políticos en el nombramiento de los jueces.
<P>
 En primer término debemos modificar la constitución. La Carta Magna
arrancada por el pueblo inglés a Juan Sin Tierra en 1215 es la primera
legislación que permitió a los más débiles, al pueblo, limitar el poder del
más fuerte, el rey. Allí nació la posibilidad de una cooperación pacífica y
no forzada entre seres humanos diferentes. Allí tiene su origen la sociedad
moderna. Todas las constituciones deben tener por objeto limitar el poder
del más fuerte, protegiendo al más débil. Deben limitar el poder de la
mayoría protegiendo a la minoría. Sin esa protección no son posibles la
cooperación social ni la sociedad moderna estable. La sociedad moderna
permite la cooperación de seres humanos marcadamente diferentes entre sí
porque el poder del más fuerte está limitado constitucionalmente en
beneficio del más débil.
<P>
 Pero en la constitución venezolana tales garantías indispensables están
mediatizadas con  frases como "salvo cuando... por razones de interés
social", dejando todo en manos de una mayoría circunstancial cuando redacta
y aprueba leyes. Esa mayoría no ha llegado a eliminar la propiedad privada,
pero ya algunos miembros del gobierno lo han insinuado. Y esa falta de
garantías reales atenta contra las inversiones extranjeras que consideran
que la seguridad de sus capitales estaría eventualmente sujeta a la voluntad
de una mayoría parlamentaria.
<P>
 En segundo término, hay que modificar el procedimiento penal. Muchos jueces
escogen la carrera para hacer uso del poder. Es como si le preguntáramos a
los curas porqué han escogido el sacerdocio y nos dijeran "para oír los
secretos de las confesiones y chantajear a los feligreses". 
<P>
                  El problema es que los jueces penales examinan, bajo
secreto, la presunta comisión de un delito y pueden privar de la libertad a
cualquier ciudadano. En Venezuela recluir a alguien en el Retén de Catia, en
Caracas, equivale a una sentencia de muerte. Es urgente, por lo tanto,
eliminar el secreto sumarial y limitar el exagerado poder de los jueces en
la legislación actual.
<P>
 Otro grave problema es que en la legislación venezolana los menores no son
imputables hasta los 18 años. Así vemos cómo mafiosos se aprovechan
entrenándolos para mandarlos a asesinar por contrato. Otro es la falta de
claridad en la definición de delitos de difamación e injuria perpetrados
contra personas jurídicas o sus marcas de fábrica, especialmente en
productos de consumo masivo, cuyas ventas pueden destruirse como
consecuencia de un proceso de difamación o de falsa acusación a través de
los medios de comunicación.
<P>
 El terrorismo judicial y la inseguridad jurídica que de ella se desprende
mantiene a Venezuela sumida en la pobreza y el atraso. ©

<title>Statement of Principles -- ACU</title>

<CENTER><H2>The American Conservative Union </H2></CENTER>
<HR>
<P>
<I>Statement Of Principles </I>
 <P>
We believe that the Constitution of the United States is the best political  
charter yet created by men for governing themselves. It is our belief that  
the Constitution is designed to guarantee the free exercise of the inherent  
rights of the individual through strictly limiting the power of  
government. 
 <P>
We reaffirm our belief in the Declaration of Independence, and in  
particular the belief that our inherent rights are endowed by the Creator.  
We further believe that our liberties can remain secure only if  
government is so limited that it cannot infringe upon those rights. 
 <P>
We believe that capitalism is the only economic system of our time that is  
compatible with political liberty. It has not only brought a higher standard  
of living to a greater number of people than any other economic system  
in the history of mankind; more important, it has been a decisive  
instrument in preserving freedom through maintaining private control of  
economic power and thus limiting the power of government. 
 <P>
We believe that collectivism and capitalism are incompatible, and that  
when government competes with capitalism, it jeopardizes the natural  
economic growth of our society and the well-being and freedom of the  
citizenry. 
 <P>

 <P>
We believe that it is the responsibility of the individual citizen, whenever  
his inherent rights are threatened from within or without, to join together  
with other individuals to protect these rights, or, when they have been  
temporarily lost, to regain them. 
 <P>
We believe that any responsible conservative organization must conduct  
itself within the framework of the Constitution; in pursuance of this belief  
we refuse to countenance any actions which conflict in any way with the  
traditions of the American political system. 
 <P>
The American Conservative Union is created to realize these ends  
through the cooperation in responsible political action, of all Americans  
who cherish the principles upon which the Republic was founded. 
 <P>
The American Conservative Union will welcome all Americans who are  
prepared to fight for the realization and preservation of these principles  
through political action at the local, state and national level. 
 <P>
                -- Adopted December, 1964

Dear Cleta:
<p>
I live in Glenside, PA, but my family pays more taxes to the city of 
Philadelphia than we do to our home township and county combined.  
Now Mayor Rendell has come out to my town and said we aren't paying 
enough!  We moved out of Philadelphia because we couldn't afford private 
school for our kids at the same time we were supporting patronage and 
perks for Rendell's friends.  How can I help him get it?  
<p>
--Robbed by the City of Brother Love
</pre>
<p>
Dear Robbed:
<p>
I presume you are talking about the income tax paid by people who work in Philadelphia but who live outside of the city.  Is that what you're talking about?  If not, write back and clarify.  If it is, you are taxed without representation.  You pay taxes on income to a jurisdiction in which you have no voting representation.  I'm wondering if the constitutionality of such a system has ever been tested in the courts.  Maybe you should contact one of the public interest legal foundations and discuss filing a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of such a system.

Dear Cleta:
<p>
Here is a possible idea for a "10" Veep nominee.  How about former 
governor Casey of Penn.? Yes, he is a Democrat but that makes the 
choice more provacative and interesting.  He comes from an area that 
is key to winning the election.  If he can pass any health concerns, 
he would be a great choice.
<p>
What do you think?
<p>
--Frank 
<p>
</pre>
Dear Frank:  
<p>
I think the Republican convention would go nuts if Bob Dole nominates a Democrat for Vice President.  Did you hear the furor when Dole floated Sam Nunn's name a few months ago?  I admire Bob Casey and his courage, but his health isn't great -- and with Bob Dole's age it makes the Vice Presidential candidate's health a key issue for the fall.  Nice try -- but it's probably a non-starter.

Dear Cleta:
<p>
I have long opposed the minimum wage as an infrngement into American 
private business by a fat over-regulating government.  I resent Uncle 
telling me how much I must pay someone to perform a given task.  How 
can we stop this and other unwarranted entanglement by government in 
private citizens' interests?
<p>
--Doc
</pre><p>
Dear Doc:  
<p>
The way you stop the federal government is by electing members of Congress who are willing to say "no" to their own constituents -- and get the government out of our hair.  That means you should make yourself known to candidates and incumbents and don't vote for anyone who is for higher taxes, more spending and bigger government.  That means you should vote for people who are for LIMITED government, which means term limits, balanced budget amendment, lower taxes.  If we are to create an environment where every person can realize the American Dream, we're going to have to organize the people who think like we do -- and fight back against the powerful interests who want a government that grows and grows.  If you want to help with that effort, write back and add your name to our list of the "Dream Team":  people who will work for real politcal change in America. We'll tell you how.

Dear Cleta:
<p>
As active Constitutionalists, we must find a way to force the major media to <br>tell the truth about losses of our freedoms under the Constitution. We know that <br>laws being forced upon us are in truth unlawful, yet media supports every <br>oppressive law they pass.  I have tried to get them to begin telling the <br>people the truth about internal enemies of our Republic...to no avail. <br>I then assume that the media is part of the conspiracy to destroy <br>American freedoms.
<p>
Any suggestions?

<p>
Dear Constitutionalist:  
<p>
Yes.  Don't watch the network news, only read conservative newspapers and listen to conservative talk radio.  Since you don't get a balanced view of the world from the mainstream media anyway, you won't be missing anything except a rise in your blood pressure every time you read the paper or watch the news.

Dear Cleta,<br>
<p>
I live in Utah, where the local politicians talk conservatively but act <br>like big spending liberals. For example, our governor actively pursues states <br>rights while he continues to support dumping large amounts of money into <br>a failing educational system and does not support vouchers.
<p>
How can we convince "conservative" politicians to support conservative causes?
<p>
-- Truly Conservative
</pre>
<p>
Dear Truly:
<p>
There are only two things that influence a politician:  votes and money.   The state teacher organizations have a lot of influence even with conservative Republican governors  because they represent lots of votes.  And not only do the teacher unions control the education agenda in most states, but the state school boards association, the school administrators organizations, and even the PTA are all together when it comes to opposing vouchers.  Until and unless the rank and file taxpaying public get organized to support parents' rights in the use of their tax dollars for school choice, the aforementioned organizations (which mostly operate with tax dollars, by the way) will continue to dominate the issue of vouchers, even with governors like Mike Leavitt.  In Utah, however, I would think that a natural ally for you would be the Mormon Church.  Do you know where it stands on school vouchers?  My advice would be to start organizing Mormon parents to get the church to be supportive of vouchers.  Add to that the parents who home school, the Christian Coalition and other family groups,  teachers who are willing to speak out against their union leadership on this issue, Catholic school parents and leaders, and you will have put together a grassroots coalition of parents and taxpayers who represent a lot of votes.  Then, your governor will start to pay attention.

Dear Cleta:
<p>
With the federal government doing so many detrimental things in so many <br>different arenas, what can a person do to combat this overwhelming takeover <br>of our God-given freedoms? Do we even have a Constitution any more? How can <br>they get away with this?
<p>
--Drowning in a sea of politicians
</pre>
<p>
Dear Drowning:
<p>
They get away with it for two reasons:  First,  because the careerists in Washington -- of BOTH political parties -- are more concerned about "getting things done on Capitol Hill" than in making sure they stop bad things from being done.  A good example is what has happened to the Republican Congress in the last six months.  The Democrats have basically put themselves back in charge of Congress and the Republicans have let them be back in charge -- so we have the GOP Congress passing an increase in the minimum wage because the minority (the Democrats) demand it.  That's why I love the House freshmen -- they aren't afraid to take a stand and draw a line in the sand.  It outrages all the insiders -- but the bad things have happened here due to the "go along, get along" philosophy that has ruled Washington for such a long time.
<p>
Second reason:  because average hardworking Americans are not equipped with the right kind of information to do anything about any of this.  Most people have no idea how their representatives and senators in Congress really vote on things that people care about.  And trying to find out voting records is not easy.  So we (my colleagues and I) are working to come up with a system to provide specific information to citizens on a regular basis about how the congressmen and senators vote on things -- and whether the votes are liberal or conservative.  Watch for more information about this effort!  I think if the public knew how most of these congressmen vote, the voters would make changes in Congress.  The politicians fear that, too, which is why they make it so hard for the public to know what they're doing.  We're working on a way to change that.

Dear Cleta:

     How do I get my local newspaper to print my 'letters-to-the-editor'?

     It is my humble opinion that my letters are both cogent and relevent, 
yet they are rarely printed.  They are not overly wordy nor are they blazing 
tirades, but rather are reasoned opinions on todays issues.  I usually open 
with a statement, build a reasoned argument supporting my opening statement 
and then close with a call to action.  I always include my name, address 
and phone number with the letter for verification.

     Can you offer some suggestions?  If you would like, I can send an 
example of a recent letter for your critique.

Cordially,
Robert
</pre>
<p>
Dear Robert:  
</p>
<p>      You didn't say where you're from, so I don't know if you live in a big city or a small town.  Big city papers are the worst -- they are hard to crack because people don't know one another personally.  In a smaller community, the editors tend to know the folks who write letters.  Here are some suggestions:  Call the editor who puts together the letters page (or feature) and ask for an appointment.  Go see the editor and take some of your rejects.  Ask for constructive criticism and try to find out why none of your letters have been printed.  If the editor is a decent person, he/she will try to be helpful and may give you some pointers.  What will really happen is he/she will have a face to put with your name and you'll probably get your next letter printed.  If the editor is a jerk, document the way you were mistreated and send a letter to the editor's boss, usually the managing editor, with a copy to the jerk.  You'll never get a letter printed afterwards but it's not happening now either -- so at least you may be the one who sensitizes the paper a bit for the next guy.
<p>
     The problem with most newspapers is there is little or no competition.  But if there are weekly papers or other community papers in your area, don't overlook those.  They tend to be much more receptive to letters and citizen involvement.  And if you have a local radio talk show, be sure to call and tell your story there about how the newspaper is blacking out your opinions.  One of the reasons that radio talk shows are so successful is because people who have been shut out of many newspapers finally have an outlet.
<p>
     Good luck -- and keep writing (and expressing) your opinions!
</p>
<pre>
Dear Cleta:

     I live in the 20th Congressional District of Texas, "represented" by 
Henry B. Gonzalez, a fat socialist thug who beat up a constituent with whom 
he disagreed in a public restaurant in San Antonio.  The case went to court, 
where Gonzalez's wrists were slapped.  He has a Republican opponent, James 
Walker, who needs help in his campaign.  You don't have to be a rocket 
scientist to know if Gonzalez were backed with tanks and guns he'd be a 
communist.  Ideologically, he thinks just like a communist.  But, lo and 
behold, Walker IS a rocket scientist!  He's a smart guy who can use our help.  
The redrawn district has many independents and conservatives, while many of 
its yellow-dog Democrats may not vote out of disgust for Gonzalez, who was 
nowhere to be found during the fight to save Kelly AFB--in his 20th District--
from the chopping block.

Sincerely,
Marco
</pre>
<p>
Dear Marco:
</p>
<p>  See my advice in our    <a href="/abic/letters/letter-3.html.cgi">first Capital Letters column</a> regarding my representative, Connie Morella.  The same advice holds true for every incumbent.  One difference is that you have a candidate right now.  If he doesn't have a lot of money, it may take more than one race for him to win.  Remember, an entrenched incumbent may have to face a tough challenge a couple of times before it's successful.  And sometimes the mere fact that he/she is facing a tough race is enough to cause him/her to take that fat congressional pension and retire.  
<p>
     In Gonzalez's case, his taxpayer supported pension is worth over $1.2 million.  Why not round up some money and run some radio ads telling people that Gonzalez voted against term limits, against the balanced budget amendment and has a big fat congressional pension that he's voted for himself?  And if it doesn't work this time, just keep working on letting people know how he votes.  It certainly doesn't represent the thinking of that district, I'm sure.  Don't let him get by with it!  Just tell on him every chance you get.
<p>
<p>
<pre>

Dear Cleta:

     Very nice web page!  Listen, you think you have problems with Connie 
Morella?  My Congressman, Albert Wynn (D-MD 4) makes Rep. Morella look like 
a right wing conservative!  This district is one of those "minority" 
districts that is full of government employees, very liberal, etc.  Wynn 
takes elections with 75+% of the vote, and gets lots of AFL-CIO money.
How do we get HIM to listen to logic and reason, or, in the alternative,
displace someone like him?

Signed,
Ron
</pre>
<p>
Dear Ron:
<p>
     You've just advanced a major reason why the "apartheid" districts have been held unconstitutional by the US Supreme Court.  Race cannot be used as a factor in determining the congressional district boundaries.  Unfortunately, political persuasion and incumbency can -- and that is what matters most to incumbents.
<p>
     In the meanwhile, I believe that most black voters are much more conservative than their representatives.  Think about putting together a group of thoughtful constituents in Wynn's district that is bi-racial.  Visit some black ministers and start talking with them about family values and morality issues.  Most minority voters support issues like school choice, term limits, and conservative positions on social issues. Most minority representatives in Congress vote the other way.  See if you can build some common ground with some of the minority citizens who share your views on issues -- and once you get to know one another, perhaps you can reach consensus on some issues on which Wynn votes wrong.  Your activist group might be able to persuade him to change his voting pattern - or perhaps you can begin grooming a replacement who would be more in line with your views.  Don't just assume that minority voters are in tune with their Congressional Black Caucus.  On many, many issues, that is not the case.  The problem is that members of the Black Caucus rarely have any opponents so they vote however they want to.  It is a disgraceful situation and one that is perhaps being changed by the recent Supreme Court rulings on the racial gerrymandering.
<p>
     P.S.  Thank you for the compliment about the web page!  We're glad you're enjoying it!

Dear Cleta,

I am interested in helping organize a group of neighbors for a specific 
cause. Without too much detail, let me briefly explain the problem.
In a middle class neighborhood in which the residents are hard working,
honest citizens, an individual has recently purchased a house citizens,
an individual has recently purchased a house for the purpose of renting
it out. The individual is developing a pattern of renting to people 
who seem to be prone to criminal activity. The house has become a slum 
in the middle of the neighborhood. There has been constant traffic in 
and out of this house and subsequently the neighborhood. Some of these
individuals are known drug users. There have been people sleeping in 
junk cars on the property. There have been numerous residential 
breakins. Several neighbors have witnessed pot smoking in the front 
yard by some of the seven adults that live there. The response from 
the landlord, who lives in another part of town but whose ex-wife lives
next to the rental property, has been something like, "Well, they pay 
their rent on time."

Can we do anything not only to clean the situation up but to also 
prevent the landlord from repeating the act over and over?

A concerned citizen
</pre>
<p>
Dear Concerned:
<p>
<dd>Good for you for taking on illegal activities in your neighborhood!  Keep 
in mind the 3 things you must do to win this fight: 1) gain allies and friends 
2) document everything and 3) make as much noise as you can among decision 
makers. Big shots hate 
noisy constituents.
Some specific suggestions:
<ol>
<li>Document the incidents you wrote about, including the residential break-ins.  List dates and times; take photographs and keep taking them every couple of days.  Build a file.
<li>Check your zoning laws.  Do the laws for your neighborhood permit rental to other than single families?  If not, report (in writing) the violation of the law to your planning and zoning commission, with the documentation.  There are probably also zoning laws about "eyesores" and "public nuisances".  Talk to the city attorney's office in your community and find out what the law is and what the procedures are for getting city action.  You're paying the city attorney--use his/her services as much as possible.
<li>Circulate a petition in your neighborhood. Get signatures from as many of  your neighbors as possible on a petition calling on the landlord to evict the current tenants and supervise the property more carefully.  Rouse the rabble on your side.
<li>Send copies of the petitions and documentation to:
<dd>-- your local elected officials;
<dd>--your local newspapers.  Contact the "metro" section, not the editorial and major reporting side if it's a large paper.  If it's a small paper, it doesn't matter.  Call the managing editor and ask him/her to send out a reporter.  
<dd>-- local TV stations.  Many have developed programs such as "In your corner" where they help citizens take on city hall and that type of thing.  Call your TV stations, and send them copies of your documentation.  If there are good visuals, they might send out a camera crew and do a story.


<dd>-- your local police chief and/or supervising officer in your area.  Follow up with a call to the police and ask what they are doing about this situation.
<li>Organize a meeting of your neighbors in one of your homes to discuss legal action. Call your Mayor and city council member(s) and invite him/her to attend the neighborhood meeting, at which you should present the evidence (again) of the situation and ask what they intend to do about it. Put the officials on the spot. Invite the landlords to attend and explain what they plan to do about the situation.  Invite the press.
<li>Is there an attorney in your neighborhood?  Do any of the neighbors have a son or daughter who is an attorney?  That may become a necessity at some point -- although I'm always hesitant to tell people to hire/listen to an attorney.  They're not universally good and sometimes they are too afraid to lead your group in a fight.  But it wouldn't hurt to start assessing potential attorneys that might be available to help out if you need to file legal proceedings.
<li>Organize a group to appear at your city council meeting if the private meetings don't produce any results.
</ol>
<dd>If you try these things and nothing happens, write me back and we'll figure out what to do next.
<p>

Dear Cleta:

I am a College Professor who became active in local Republican 
politics in the late 80s, on the assumption that all political 
should begin locally. Now, I find myself on the Board of Directors 
of a group called United Conservatives of Ohio.  (I live and teach
in the Dayton, Ohio area.)  UCO does little now except to rate state
legislators (Senators and Assemblymen) and publish these ratings,
something like the American Conservative Union, with which we are 
loosely affiliated.  I would like them to do more than this.  What
do you think of the following, and is there anything you would add to
the list:
 
-a "Home Page" on the Web;
-a quarterly newsletter, focusing on state rather than national issues;
-broader solicitation for funds (at present, we are mostly supported by 
lobbyists and a biennial fund-raising dinner).

We already have a PAC, legally separate from UCO, which doles out tiny 
contributions (in the $100 to $500 range) to candidates for the Ohio 
Legislature.

Thank you in advance for any hints you may have.

Board Member, United Conservatives of Ohio

</pre>
<p>
Dear United Conservatives of Ohio:

<dd>Good for you!  Organizing a statewide entity, having a PAC and hosting a biennial dinner are great activities.  A Web site is another good idea.  Maybe your site should be hooked up with Town Hall somehow, the national conservative web site, so other Ohio folks can find you more easily on the web.
<p>
<dd>One suggestion is to have press conferences during this fall election season where you present your endorsement and contribution directly, in person to the state legislative candidates you've endorsed.  Have a prepared statement as to why this good candidate has garnered your endorsement, the issues that he/she has been particularly good on, and a paragraph about your organization and how to contact it. Have photographers and local reporters there -- or go the newspaper itself in the smaller towns and have your press conference at the newspaper offices. 
<p>
<dd>This is a way for your $100 contribution to be turned into several hundred dollars worth of free press, plus, you look a candidate/legislator in the eye and say thank you publicly at a time when it means something to them.  They will be even more committed to your issues thereafter!
<p>
<dd>Good luck!

Dear Cleta:

     I live in Maryland and my congresswoman is Connie 
Morella.  She voted against term limits and other significant 
items in the Contract with America.  Everyone says she is 
unbeatable. Is that true and is there anything I can do to mount 
a campaign against her?

                     Taxed but not represented in Maryland
</pre>
<p>

Dear Taxed:
<p>
<dd>You're right.  Connie Morella is disgusting.  She votes wrong on most things.  I know, because she's my congresswoman, too...  Here are some suggestions if you are serious about replacing her:
<p>
<dd>First, this is a long term proposition -- it isn't going to be done overnight.  It will take at least 18 months of planning a campaign to get rid of her, and it might take two election cycles of intense effort.  It is difficult to get rid of an incumbent member of Congress without an infusion of major dollars and assistance like the labor unions are presently pouring into beating up on some of the freshmen.
<p>
<dd>Second, a small group of 5 to 10 people, dedicated to ridding the Congress of Rep. Morella should begin meeting monthly through the end of this year.  Who should come to the meeting?  People with a sincere desire to beat Connie Morella -- and at least one or two people who have been involved in politics in some form prior to this effort. The information at the meeting should include a map of the district and the voting patterns in both the GOP and Democratic primaries as well as the general elections from the past 3 cycles.  
<p>
<dd>Third, form some task forces: research (to gather information about her record); candidate recruitment (to develop a list of possible opponents for Rep. Morella); third, outreach (to develop a plan for broadening the circle of activists plotting her overthrow); fourth, finance (you can't do this for free).
<p>
<dd>Watch the fall campaign carefully and continue to meet monthly through December.  By then, you should have complete research on her record through this Congress and a sense of what it's going to take to beat her in two years.  When you've got that all assembled, write me again and we'll go from there.  
<p>
<dd>This is a good project.  I hope you'll do it.

<center><h2>Letter from the Chairman</h2></center>
<b>Dear MRC Member,</b>
<p>
<dd><big>W</big>elcome to <i>Flash</i>, the new monthly newsletter pub-lished exclusively for Media Research Center Members.
<dd>Why a membership newsletter? Actually, the idea is rather simple -- and overdue. Recently we conducted a survey of our supporters to see how well we were keeping you informed about our work at the Media Research Center. 
<dd>The results told me we needed to do a better job.  Members supporting our Entertainment Division efforts weren't aware of the work of the News Division. Subscribers to our newsletters didn't know we had recently opened an office in Hollywood, the Parents' Television Council. PTC supporters aren't following the work of our Free Enterprise and Media Institute. And so on. 
<dd>The survey pointed to the need for a publication for MRC members only. Hence, <i>Flash</i>.
<dd>Each month <i>Flash</i> will serve as your connector to the MRC and its special projects, giving you the timely information on the many projects you are sup-porting through your membership.  Our newsletters. Books. Media appearances. Special reports. Studies. Press releases. Our nationally syndicated column. And much, much  more. 
<dd>Through your newsletter you will also be apprised of  Members' discounts on our merchandise and publications.
<dd>We want you to be abreast of what's going on here and how your gifts make it possible for us to expose and challenge the liberal media.
<dd>As a supporter of the MRC, you understand that the national news media have used their power to promote their left wing views. 
And thanks to you, now the public is on to them, too!
<dd>The Times Mirror Corporation took a survey which shows that 43 percent of the public today believes the national news media set the national agenda. You and I have known that for years. Now, through our efforts, the public is catching on!
<dd>There is another critical front, the cultural wars raging in the entertainment industry. The MRC, through its Parents' Tele-vision Council arm, is leading the fight for pro-family values in entertainment fare. The PTC's mission is to bring responsible, family oriented programming to television, and to organize and mobilize Hollywood conservatives as national spokesmen for our cause.
<dd>The Media Research Center is the largest, most active organization in America identifying, exposing and confronting the liberal agenda of the news and entertainment industries. You make that possible with your support.
<dd> In these pages you'll see why <i>Time</i> (grudgingly) admitted that, "for quality, resources and sheer volume of output, the new star on the right is the Media Research Center."
<dd>We hope you enjoy Flash. And we welcome any questions, comments or suggestions you may have. Please contact us at 1-800-MRC-1423. Or drop me a line. It's always good to hear from you.
<p> 
Sincerely,
<p>

<center><h2>Networks Gnawing at Newt</h2></center>
<dd><big>T</big>he national news media continue to ignore political scandals involving the Clinton administration, but wouldn't dare miss an opportunity to report any allegations, no matter how far fetched, against Republicans. MRC's news media analysts regularly follow this trend and expose the reporting of political scandals.
<dd>The results are predictable: biased reporting, chock-full of half-truths and outright distortions.
<dd>Take Newt Gingrich's book deal, for example.
<dd>The media have decided to link bulk sales of Gingrich's book, <i>To Renew America</i>, with violations by former Speaker Jim Wright with his book, <i>Reflections of a Public Man</i>. CNN <i>Prime News</i> anchor Linden Soles introduced a Bob Franken story: "This could be a case of what goes around come around," referring to Gingrich's expose of Wright's bulk book sales violation, which led to his resignation. 
<dd>An article in <i>Newsweek</i> went so far as to claim, "Former Speaker Jim Wright dismissed a pudgy, loudmouthed back-bencher named Newt Gingrich right up to the day in 1989 when Gingrich's guerrilla campaign forced Wright's resignation from the House. Now it appears that Gingrich has made exactly the same mistake".
<p>
<font size=+1><i><center>What the media know, but didn't tell you, is that <br>the two deals have nothing in common.</center></i></font>
<p>
<dd>What the media know, but didn't tell you, is that the two deals have nothing in common.
<dd>Wright's book deal gave him an outrageously high royalty of 55 percent -- from a publisher who happened to be a former employee.  Gingrich only earned the standard 15 percent from a real publisher. Wright's book was never even sold in bookstores, it was of-fered almost exclusively in bulk sales to lobbyists -- enabling him to get around House limits on honoraria income. 
<dd>Gingrich's book was a genuine commercial property, lasting 12-weeks on the best-seller list (selling close to a half-million books). In addition, the Gingrich book had a grand total of five bulk orders,  totaling just over 500 books.
<dd>Wright was charged with 69 counts of ethics violations -- and resigned in disgrace before being indicted.
<dd>Or take the case of another Democrat, former Speaker Tom Foley.  In 1993 the <i>Boston Globe</i> reported the SEC fined an investment firm $100,000 for giving friends preferential treatment with new stock offerings -- one friend being the former Speaker -- and the networks didn't even blink. Small investors like Foley are generally not privy to initial public offerings (IPOs).
<dd>With this information, Foley was reported to have reaped profits on eleven out of twelve initial public IPOs offered to him the previous year. And yet only one network (CNN's <i>Inside Politics</i>) covered the story! The rest completely ignored Foley's investments.
<dd>Our news analysts uncover these facts, then distribute them to millions of people around the country on a regular basis. Research like this is made possible thanks to your support.

<center><h2>FEMI Calls Journalists On The Carpet</h2></center>
<h3>Here's a Pop Quiz:</h3>

<dd><big>R</big>epublicans in Congress propose to balance the budget while increasing spending by 50 percent over 7 years.
<dd>President Clinton calls this a massive cut and shuts down the government for about a week in protest.
<dd>Guess which side the media took.
<dd>It wasn't difficult to predict that they would parrot Mr. Clinton's point of view. That's what they usually do. But something needed to be done about it, or else the American people wouldn't hear the truth.
<dd>That's where the MRC's Free Enterprise and Media Institute steps in. After analyzing the biased coverage of the first few days of the shutdown, FEMI issued a rapid-response study rebutting the media's liberal spin. 
<dd>In the middle of the shutdown, the study of the first few days' coverage was faxed to hundreds of journalists, press secretaries on Capitol Hill, and prominent conservatives.
<dd>The study found that journalists were refusing to report that spending under the GOP plan was actually increasing; and that reporters were only interviewing people upset about the shutdown while ignoring the nearly half of all Americans who thought it wasn't a problem.
<dd>Lo and behold, coverage started to change! The night after we faxed out the study, NBC News produced a report showing how most people outside the beltway weren't put off by the shutdown.  
<dd>An on December 12, ABC's <i>Nightline</i> exposed Mr. Clinton for lying about GOP "cuts." They actually showed, with a graph on screen, how Republicans were planning on increasing federal spending.
<dd>Keeping the media on their toes is our mission! But we need your help in order to continue this fight.

<center><h2><i>Family Guide</i> Gives Parents the Facts</h2></center>

<dd><big>P</big>arents are fed up with the values their children are learning from network television. This year it's worse than ever.  The four major networks appear to be engaged in a fierce competition for the dubious honor of seeing just how many obscenities, lewd remarks, and sexual situations they can pack into a nighttime television program.
<dd>And the family hour -- the  8 p.m.. time slot dedicated for children's programming -- is now the time slot for some of the worst programming of them all.
<dd>As much as parents may want to do it, there's no way anyone can monitor everything on network television today. This year there are over 90 different programs on network prime time television alone. That's all changed now.
<dd>Through our West Coast office, the Parents' Television Council, we have released the <b><i>1995-`96 Family Guide to Prime Time Television</i></b>, the first ever comprehensive review of the values presented on every single network evening program.
<dd>MRC analysts reviewed thousands of hours of program footage to compile the <i>Family Guide</i>. They looked at all NBC, ABC, CBS, and Fox shows as well as the newest offerings from the WB and UPN networks.
<dd>Rather than look at the artistic merits of a show, the guide analyzes it from the standpoint of values. Which shows are offensive for children? Which shows are highly recommended?
<dd>The Guide is presented in an easy to read format.  Every show on network television is presented with a brief "background" section about its themes, and that's followed with a "summary" outlining what is offensive, or what is recommended.
<dd>The guide is presented with a stoplight format. Red lights are given to those programs not recommended for youngsters; yellow lights for those that contain questionable material; and green lights for those that are recommended for children.
<dd>In November, MRC Chairman L. Brent Bozell III and Parents' Television Council Co-Chair-man Shirley Jones held a press conference in Hollywood to officially release the <i>Family Guide</i>. As Ms. Jones put it, "The <i>Family Guide to Prime Time Television</i> [is] a new and vital weapon in the fight for [children's] minds. That it has not been available until now is only testament to our parental impotency, that as of this day and this announcement is no longer acceptable."
<dd>Many others have praised the <i>Family Guide</i> including William Bennett, who described it as "an excellent resource: objective, accurate, easy to use...the Media Research Center has been doing good work for a long time. [The <i>Family Guide</i>] will surely reinforce its reputation."
<dd>We hope to distribute tens of thousands around the country this year. To help pay for this very expensive project, we are offering the <i>Family Guide</i> at a special rate for our members. With this guide in hand you won't have to worry anymore about the poison on prime time television affecting the children.

<center><h2>Festering Foster</h2></center>
<dd><bing>S</big>everal new developments renewed questions about White House actions related to the Travel Office firings and the death of Vince Foster.  But you wouldn't know if from watching network news.  On October 24 the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee released a May 14, 1993 memo from then-White House aide David Watkins in which he said the First Lady told him to replace career Travel Office employees with a private firm partially owned by a friend.  That contradicted statements made by White House officials over the past two years.  The next day, three handwriting experts asserted that Vince Foster's suicide note was a forgery, thereby implicating White House employees in a grand deception.
<dd>With the exception of a brief mention on NBC's <i>Today</i> on October 29 the networks were silent.  <i>Today</i> co-host Jack Ford asked Tim Russert about "new questions raised about the death of Vince Foster" which "curiously didn't get much coverage at all, the idea now that some experts are questioning the legitimacy of that suicide note."

<p>
<p><FONT COLOR="2F4F4F"><b>Moderator:</b> Welcome to Meet the Media, the fantasy world of objective journalism, where some of the most important media leaders in the land convene to give you the unfettered truth, the expert analysis concerning the important issues of the day. Today we look at the budget crisis. Let me start with you, E.J. If Bill Clinton were to sign the GOP bill, what would happen?</FONT>
<p><b>E.J. Dionne (<i>Washington Post</i>):</b> "I think that with those kinds of cuts in Medicaid, you really could do a lot of damage or at least cause problems for middle class people."
<p><b>Alan Murray (<i>Wall Street Journal</i>):</b> "If enacted it  would largely get the federal government out of the business of helping the poor. It would mean a much smaller government. It would probably mean a balanced budget. But I think the critics are also right that in some important ways it would mean a less humane government."
<p><FONT COLOR="2F4F4F"><b>Moderator:</b> "Wait a moment, Alan, you sound like Dick Gephardt here. The Republican bill includes a spending increase of $2.6 trillion over the next seven years. That's hardly a much smaller government."</FONT>
<p><b>Robert MacNeil (PBS):</b> "Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle said the Democratic plan would cut $89 billion over seven years, a third of what the Republicans have proposed to slash."
<p><FONT COLOR="2F4F4F"><b>Moderator:</b> "But that's my point. Politicians like Daschle and Clinton talk about $271 billion in cuts for Medicare but actually, under the GOP plan, spending in 2002 will be $86 billion higher than 1995. That's an increase of 6 percent annually, far more than inflation. It sounds like the Democrats don't have their facts straight, Eleanor."</FONT>
<p><b>Eleanor Clift (<i>Newsweek</i>):</b>  "The Democrats, the big mistake they've made is they ought to have advertisements about deterioration of quality, they ought to show an elderly person in a hospital, bell  ringing for a nurse who doesn't show up. That's where the cutbacks are going to be."
<p><b>Tom Brokaw (NBC):</b> "Are the Republicans most vulnerable here because they want to make these big cuts in Medicare and also give a tax cut, including tax cuts to those people making $100,000 or more?"
<p><b>John Yang (<i>Washington Post</i>):</b> "President Clinton has declared the GOP budget proposals too extreme and threatened a veto unless Republicans agree to scale back their $245 billion tax cut and the massive cuts in health care for the elderly and poor, welfare programs, student loans, and the Earned Income Tax Credit for the working poor."
<p><FONT COLOR="2F4F4F"><b>Moderator:</b>  "I thought I just explained to you that under the Republicans there are no massive spending cuts proposed! And even with the tax cuts, the Republican plan projects tax revenues to increase by 41percent over the next seven years."</FONT>
<p><b>Dan Rather (CBS):</b>  "Republicans vowed to press for huge cuts in government spending and $245 billion in tax cuts. President Clinton vowed to veto it as too radical and to extreme."
<p><FONT COLOR="2F4F4F"><b>Moderator:</b>  "Dan, are you listening? Oh, never mind. Let's move on. The political landscape. Who can the Republicans count on for support?"</FONT>
<p><b>Clarence Page (<i>Chicago Tribune</i>):</b> "Most of the KKK has joined the Republican Party."
<p><FONT COLOR="2F4F4F"><b>Moderator:</b>  "Whoa! You may not like the Republicans, but where did that come from?"</FONT>
<p><b>Michael Gartner (<i>USA Today</i>):</b> "There's more to governing than likability. We learned that from the likable Ronald Reagan, who charmed us with stories as he amassed huge deficits and spent billions on goofy defense plans. No, the record is more important. And Bill Clinton's record is just short of terrific."
<p><FONT COLOR="2F4F4F"><b>Moderator:</b> "Really? Conservatives, particularly the religious right, will tell you he's completely out of step with the cultural revolution sweeping the land. Just look at the outpouring of love for Pope John Paul II when he was here last month."</FONT>
<p><b>Timothy McNulty (<i>Chicago Tribune</i>)</b> "Without naming names or even mentioning the Republican-dominated Congress, the Pope seemed to admonish the supporters of propose laws to restrict immigration and dismantle many of the nation's programs for the poor. In doing so, he appeared to echo many of Presidents Clinton's warnings."
<p><FONT COLOR="2F4F4F"><b>Moderator:</b>  "OK, so it's resolved: the Pope's a Democrat. We've only got a few seconds left. Last question to Cokie: Is there a bias in the media's coverage of the budget debate?"</FONT>
<p><b>Cokie Roberts (ABC):</b>  "I think there is a bias in favor of spending money, but I don't think it's liberal versus conservative, but a bias in favor of government programs and spending  money, even if there is not money there to spend and even if you're heaping debt on the next generation."
<p><FONT COLOR="2F4F4F"><b>Moderator:</b>  And that's the last word. A final programming note for our audience. I, of course, am a fictional creation. My guests are not, and neither is every single quote attributed to them. Have a good day.</FONT>

<center><h2>Prime Time's Missing Mangers</h2></center>
<dd><big>H</big>ave you noticed what's passing for holiday fare on prime time television these days?
<dd>Sure, the networks air special Christmas episodes of their shows, but how many actually deal with Christmas?
<dd>Here at the Media Research Center, our Entertainment Division decided to take a closer look at the content of the networks' holiday offerings.
<dd>In our review of 1994 prime time holiday-themed shows, we found that some contained secularized statements of religious principles, but only a few dealt with the Biblical significance of Christmas, or touched on Scripture at all.
<dd>Unfortunately, those same networks did manage to crank out a good deal of tastelessness and religion-bashing for airing during the Christmas season.
<dd>ABC's <ii>Roseanne</i> was the top offender both in 1994 and 1995. How difficult would it have been to offer one, just one episode that contained family values, that celebrated the Christmas spirit? Surely out of respect for the holiest seasons, Roseanne would tone down her assault on traditional values.
<p>
<center><i><font size=+1>Unfortunately, those same networks did manage to crank out a good <br>deal of tastelessness and religion-bashing for airing during the <br>Christmas season.</font></i></center>
<p>
<dd>But if you believe that you don't  know Roseanne. This is an actress who enjoys not just assaulting, but insulting family values. And she saves her best for Christmas.
<dd>Her 1994 episode concerned her son's erections at inopportune times, such as while standing at the chalkboard during class. The show ended with Roseanne reciting slang terms for erections: "pitching a trouser tent," "standing up for democracy," and so on. In 1995 she was even worse. So offensive was her December 12 episode that ABC moved the show from its usual 8:00 time slot to 9:30.
<dd>It centered on the wedding of Roseanne's boss Leon to Scott. Yes, a gay marriage, in the middle of the most family-oriented time of the year.
<dd>Not surprising that lewd "humor" pervaded the episode. When Scott, alluding to their upcoming honeymoon, suggested to Leon, "Next week, we could be snorkeling in the nude," Roseanne quipped, "Snorkeling, huh? Well, I guess you can learn a new word for it every day." Just before the wedding, Scott said to Leon, "I love you in a way that is mystical, eternal and illegal in twenty states." And after a minister performed the ceremony, they kissed. Merry Christmas from ABC Television Entertainment.
<dd>There was, however, one holiday program worth looking out for. A syndicated special entitled, <b><i>Red Boots for Christmas</i></b>, is helping to disseminate the true message of the season. 
<dd>The animated half-hour is based on a German folk tale which tells of a grouchy shoemaker who learns that the essence of Christmas is not wrapped presents under a tree, but rather God's gift to humanity: a Savior. 
<dd>Your support  of our enter-tainment division enables us to find new ways to expose how much Hollywood's leftist views differ from those people in Middle America.

<center><h2> Letter from the Chairman</h2></center>
<dd><big>A</big>fter the 1994 elections I predicted we would see the most outrageous performance ever from the leftist "news" media. Unfortunately I was right -- and it was even worse than I feared. They have turned public support against conservatives. 
<dd>Our goal in 1996 is to neutralize their impact    -- to convince the public not to believe the propaganda being pushed by the media. Early this year we will announce, at a national press conference, our <b><i>Tell the Truth!</i></b> campaign. We will demand that the national media begin -- begin -- to cover the political landscape fairly.
<dd> The <i>Tell the Truth!</i> campaign will start with the formal release of <b><i>Pattern of Deception: Bill Clinton and the National Media</i></b>. It's a devastating, systematic review of how the media have  promoted Bill Clinton from 1991 through 1995. 
<dd>Just as our first book, And That's the Way It Isn't, gave the MRC its credibility initially, this book will give credibility to our national campaign since the findings are explosive and irrefutable.
<dd>The <i>Tell the Truth!</i> <b>Blast Fax Campaign</b> will combine two of the most successful political techniques undertaken in recent years. In 1992 the Clinton campaign was absolutely ingenious with its rapid response teams. James Carville and Co. were everywhere in the national media responding to anything and everything the Republicans had to say on a moment's notice.
<dd>In 1993 Bill Kristol had a crushing impact on the national health care debate by identifying the top public policy leaders in the country and releasing a regular series of impactful fax reports. He was able to change the entire dynamic of the debate along lines of conservatives' concerns.
The <i>Tell the Truth!</i> Blast Fax Campaign will combine both techniques. We are putting together a list of approximately 1,500 top public policy leaders -- with their fax numbers in order to reach them on a regular basis with our blast fax campaign. 
<dd>When there are developments of outrageous media propaganda (which will happen on a regular basis) we will be shooting out blast faxes around the country to put the press on the defensive immediately. 
<dd>In 1996, teams of <i>Tell the Truth!</i> analysts will be in both parties' convention cities. There we will set up offices and publish a daily report exposing everything the press is doing to slant convention coverage. And by making an issue of convention coverage well in advance, we can neutralize the press if they intend to do in 1996 what they did to conservatives in 1992.
<dd>There will be a flurry of activity by us through the mainstream press.  I will continue to do my twice-weekly syndicated column as well as my weekly television commentary on the TCI television network, and will be writing a series of guest editorials on the subject for major publications like the <i>Wall Street Journal, National Review</i>, and <i>USA Today</i>.
<dd>As for our plans to neutralize the media during the presidential elections, we've got our bases covered. These plans are very expensive, however. So, we will be counting on your continued support throughout this very important election year, and I hope I can count on you.

<center><h2>The Bad and the Biased</h2>
<h3>The Best Notable Quotables of 1995</h3></center>
<h3>For a sampling of some of the awards, the envelope, please:</h3>
<p>
<dd><big>I</big>t has become a tradition at the Media Research Center to present an annual awards issue -- <b><i>The Best Notable Quotables of 1995 </i></b>-- to highlight the year's worst reporting. Each year dozens of conservative writers and talk show hosts gather together to "honor" those responsible for the most irresponsible comments.  
<dd><i>The Best Notable Quotables</i> is the MRC's most popular publication. It is reproduced in papers, the topic of conversation on radio and television talk shows across the country. 
<dd>So how do the media react to our awards?
It's not surprising that the few conservatives in the press are thrilled with our findings and use them for their own ammunition against the liberal media.
<dd><i>National Review</i> ran an excerpt from the <i>Best of Notable Quotables of 1995</i> in December. 
<dd>Mike Rosen, talk show host and columnist, ran excerpts from the <i>Best of Notable Quotables</i> recently in his column.
<dd>Ray Archer, editorial writer for <i>The Arizona Republic</i>, ran quotes from the <i>Best Notable Quotables</i>, and said this of our examples of the liberal media: "There's no dearth of venom spewed by those who typically tout the liberal line."
<dd>Jeff Jacoby, columnist for <i>The Boston Globe</i>, used an excerpt from the <i>Best of Notable Quotables</i> to prove his point in his column entitled, "How the right is demonized."
<dd>The Minneapolis <i>Star Tribune</i> ran a story on January 1 showing both sides of the media bias issue.  It's funny how the <i>Tribune</i> used all empirical, hard evidence from the <i>Best Notable Quotables of 1995</i> to back up our side, yet when it came to presenting Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting's -- FAIR, an organization which alleges <i>conservative</i> media bias -- position, the Tribune printed an opinion column from a FAIR employee, without, as usual, any evidence.
<dd>Not every story based on the <i>Best of Notable Quotables</i> was positive. 
<dd>Of course, we don't expect the "journalists" who win these awards to be happy that we've exposed their biases. 
<dd>Take Clarence Page, columnist and winner of <i>Notable Quotables'</i> year-end Award for Hypocritical Hate Mongering (for his claim that "most of the KKK ha[ve] joined the Republican Party"). He targeted the MRC and the Best Notable Quotables as the topic of a recent column which ran in the <i>Chicago Tribune.</i> 
<dd>He couldn't understand why anyone would take offense to his remark, and cited as evidence that membership in groups like the KKK had gone down during the `80s -- meaning that they were joining the Republican Party.  (How do you think liberals like Page would react if a conservative were to point out that membership in the Communist Party USA had declined in the `80s and that this meant that Communists were now supporting the Democratic Party?) 
<dd>For good measure, the peace-loving Mr. Page concluded his piece by calling supporters of the MRC -- "brownshirts."
<dd>For a full listing of the outlets which have carried our research recently, please turn to page <p>
<center><h3>We'll Decide Who's a Mean-Spirited Republican Award...</h3></center>
<p>
<dd>"The Republican  jihad against the poor, the young, and the helpless rolls on. So far no legislative assault has been too cruel, no budget cut too loathsome for the party that took control of Congress at the beginning of the year and  has spent all its time since then stomping on the last dying embers of idealism and compassion in government."
<p>
<i>--New York Times</i> columnist and former NBC reporter Bob Herbert.
<p>
<center><h3>But It's Okay for Us to Hate Them Award (for Hypocritical Hatemongering)</h3></center>
<p>
<dd>"Most of the KKK has joined the Republican Party. They don't have to be there."
<p>
-- <i>Chicago Tribune</i>'s Clarence Page, commenting on the Million Man March. Page has now written a nationally syndicated column attacking the MRC and <b>defending</b> that comment.
<p>
<center><h3>Damn Those Conservatives Award</h3></center>
<dd>"The scariest of all hobgoblins may be a fellow African American, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. In the four years since George Bush chose him to fill the 'black seat' vacated by Thurgood Marshall, Thomas has emerged as the high court's most aggressive advocate of rolling back the gains Marshall fought so hard for. The maddening irony is that Thomas owes his seat to precisely the kind of racial preference he goes to such lengths to excoriate."
<p>
-- <i>Time's</i> Jack E. White.
<p>
<center><h3> Republicans Make Us Sick Award</h3></center>
<dd>"Next week on ABC's <i>World News Tonight</i>, a series of reports on our environment which will tell you precisely what the new Congress has in mind: the most frontal assault on the environment in 25 years. Is this what the country wants?"
<p>
-- a Peter Jennings promotional spot.
<p>
<center><h3>Americans with Mathematical Disabilities Award (for Calling Hikes a Cut)</h3></center>
<dd>"House Republicans denied any impropriety when they approved federal budget reductions of $17 billion and outlined $190 billion more, slashing programs that largely benefit women, children, and the poor, to pay for that 'pouting sex kitten' mistress of their dreams -- tax cuts."
<p>
 -- U.S. News "reporter" Gerald Parshall giving the public "facts."
<p>
<center><h3>The Politics of Meaninglessness Award (for the Silliest Analysis)</h3></center>
"But aren't most medical procedures, when you describe them in detail, pretty disgusting? Isn't, for example, the production of veal, when you describe it in detail, and how people eat meat, when they crunch down on the flesh of living beings, formerly living beings, with their teeth. Isn't that pretty gruesome, too?"
<p>
-- PBS' <i>To the Contrary</i> host Bonnie Erbe, equating gruesome skull-crushing partial-birth abortions to...eating veal. <p>

<center><h3>The Dumbest Quote of the Year</h3></center>
"I think he ought to be worried about what's going on in the Good Lord's mind, because if there is retributive justice, he'll get AIDS from a transfusion, or one of his grandchildren will get it."
<p>
-- NPR's Nina Totenberg, reacting to Senator Jesse Helms' inquiry about AIDS getting more funding than cancer or heart disease.

<center><h2>New Horizons for the Entertainment Division</h2></center>
<dd><big>1</big>995 was a year of change for the MRC's 
Entertainment Division, changes which will greatly raise our profile and increase our influence in the American culture war. 
<dd>Our new mission was in large part inspired by prime time television's new agenda. In the late 1980s and early '90s, many shows were politically themed. Whether it was <i>L.A. Law</i> trashing Operation Desert Storm, <i>thirtysomething</i> promoting abortion, or <i>Designing Women</i> crusading for most every liberal cause under the sun, the small screen seemed at times to overflow with political advocacy. 
<dd>Of late, though, there has been much less explicit political content on entertainment television. 
That's the good news. 
<dd>Instead of politics, prime time is now emphasizing values, but -- here's the bad news -- Hollywood is now as hostile to traditional morality as it ever was to Ronald Reagan and Dan Quayle.
<dd>Tune in pretty much any time -- even during the so-called "family hour," between 8 and 9 p.m. -- and you'll see this for yourself. Popular series such as <i>Friends and Seinfeld</i> promote premarital sex. Obscenities are frequent on such shows as <i>NYPD Blue</i> and <i>Law & Order</i>. Parental authority is ridiculed on the likes of The Simpsons and Married...With Children. Worst of all, what was once the family hour (8-9 p.m. EST) is now reserved for many of the most offensive programs.
<dd>Yes, when it comes to what Hollywood is teaching our children, the battles are now over values, not politics. 
<dd>To put ourselves on the front lines, last year we established the Parents' Television Council, whose task is to promote responsible prime time programming by working directly with the entertainment industry.
<dd>Though the PTC is headquartered in southern California, its research ammunition will come from the MRC's main office near Washington. In order to focus more of our resources directly on the West Coast, we have decided to discontinue the publication of TV, etc., the Entertainment Division's monthly newsletter. 
<dd>Under the new plan, some of the Entertainment Division's research and analysis will be issued in monographs like the <i>Family Guide to Prime Time Television</i>; and some of it will emerge as MRC Special Reports, which will examine quantitatively the values promoted by prime time television. 
<dd>An example of the latter is our soon-to-be- released study of sexual content and vulgar language which has become a growing trend for the family hour. Yes, it seems that Hollywood is going out of its way once again to insult the traditional American family by airing material unsuited to children at an hour which in past years was set aside for family viewing. Our goal is to inform parents of these practices and through them to incite change in the entertainment industry.
<dd>We're confident that our revised approach will result in a product that will reach and enlighten an ever growing audience, particularly the parents most concerned about the poisonous values of the entertainment community.

<center><h2>PTC's <i>Family Guide</i> Makes a Splash</h2></center>
<dd><big>T</big>he Parents' Television 
   Council (PTC) is a special project of the Media Research Center. The PTC's 1995-'96 <b><i>Family Guide to Prime Time Television</i></b>, the only publication written specifically to help parents determine appropriate television programming, has received national attention since its release in late November.
<dd>The Guide was unveiled at a Hollywood press conference featuring MRC chairman L. Brent Bozell III and actress <b>Shirley Jones</b>, Honorary Co-Chair of the PTC.
<dd>And, as if all that weren't enough, the Guide has at least one fan on Capitol Hill. Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Tex.) was so impressed with the Guide that he plans to give a copy to each member of the House and has invited Brent Bozell to speak to Congress about the "influence of television on our culture" at a  "Members only" breakfast.
<dd>The PTC, Smith said, "provides Americans who want to see positive values instilled in children with an invaluable tool. The <i>Family Guide</i>...is the best summary of the values reflected in current prime time television programs that I've seen." 
<dd>Thousands of copies of the Guide now have been distributed, and its editor, Sandra L. Crawford, has conducted promotional interviews with such newspapers as the Detroit Free Press and The Washington Times as well as with such electronic outlets as the Newstalk TV cable network. 
<dd>The first television ad for the Guide aired in the Oklahoma City market.

<center><h2>FEMI Report Piques Media Interest</h2></center>
<dd><big>D</big>oes the profit motive determine what network executives put on prime time television, or is it their political ideology? 
<dd>Last summer, <b>MediaNomics</b>, the Free Enterprise & Media Institute's (a division of the MRC) newsletter, reported a strange phenomenon. 
<dd>The television networks, we reported, continue to produce prime time shows with extreme, anti-business environmental themes. It doesn't matter that such shows consistently get poor ratings. The anti-business, environmental extremism of television writers, producers, and executives forces the shows on the air.
<dd>The <i>MediaNomics</i> story caught the eye of <i>USA Today</i> magazine's editorial staff. They asked MediaNomics Editor Tim Lamer to expand the article into a story for an upcoming issue of the publication. In his report, Lamer shows how TV shows with environmental themes, such as the recently canceled seaQuest 2032 and the movie The Fire Next Time, garnered extremely poor ratings. Both took gratuitous slaps at business.
<dd>On the futuristic sci-fi show seaQuest, for example, ruthless businessman Larry Deon creates havoc for the world. He breaks off a chunk "the size of New England" from a polar icecap. He wants to flood the Middle East and create a market for his fresh water supply. (Does any of this sound the slightest bit plausible?)Viewers learn from Deon's opponent, Wolenczak, that "Lawrence Deon is a privateer, and his companies are turning the world's water supplies into sewage." Viewers also learn from another of Deon's opponents that "the man's been a grandstander since he sold IBM off in a yard sale when he was 23."
<dd>Deon also engages in piracy and tries to sabotage the Omni-Pacific, a transcontinental underwater railroad -- because it will compete with his airlines, don't you know? The government is afraid to try to stop Deon. One politician asks the crew of seaQuest: "So what are we sup-posed to do, embarrass him in front of the whole world? The last time we did that, he tripled the price of steel and nearly bankrupted the auto industry." 
<dd>America, meet the free enterprise system -- Hollywood style.
<dd>Lamer also points out that this business-bashing is not new to entertainment television. 
A 1992 FEMI study showed that business owners committed 43 percent of all crimes on television and 36 percent of all murders, far more than any other group, including politicians, lawyers -- even mobsters. All this from an industry that purports to "reflect reality."
<dd>FEMI, both through its newsletter and through respected national publications, continues to hold the networks accountable for their attacks on businessmen, society's innovators and job creators.

<center><h2><big>MRC</big> Board of Trustees Meeting</h2></center>
<dd>Each year the Media Research Center invites its Board of Trustees to Washington, D.C. to help chart  the future for the organization. It gives us a great opportunity to get input from some of the people who make our work possible through their donations. The Board met in Washington, D.C. on December 5 to formally review the MRC's work.
We think it's important to give MRC Members the same kind of information, so here are some highlights from the meeting:
<dd>MRC Chairman L. Brent Bozell III informed the Trustees of the exciting new plans for its divisions and special projects in 1996 -- the Entertainment Division's new focus on family values and the Free Enterprise and Media Institute's joint projects with other conservative organizations -- also the News Division's plans to confront the leftist media during the upcoming presidential campaign with our <I><b>Tell the Truth!</b></i>  Campaign.
<dd>Among the dignitaries and special guests, Representative J.C. Watts, Jr. (R-Okla) addressed the Trustees. He said of the media: "When it comes to liberals and their lapdog media -- they can lie louder. They are shameless." The Oklahoma Congressman continued, "I have been amazed at how people will go to the well of the House or Senate and spew forth lie after lie and scare our citizens with lies. I have watched in horror as Katie Couric has treated the Speaker of the House [Newt Gingrich] or the Majority Leader [Dick Armey] like criminals for wanting to do the right thing. They can lie louder, but we can tell the truth longer."
<dd>He continued by congratulating the MRC on the opening of the Parents' Television Council in Hollywood. Rep. Watts also reinforced the fact that family values in the entertainment industry are not only entertaining, they are very good business. 
<dd>Syndicated columnist and CNN talk show host Robert Novak also spoke at our Board of Trustees function. Pointing out the simple fact that the majority of journalists are liberal, Novak outlined eight statements that  most members of the press would support:
<ol>
<li>The Republican budget will slash spending for women, children, and the poor.
<li>The U.S. has a global role to protect human rights wherever possible.
<li>Missile defense is a waste of money.
<li>A major purpose of government is income redistribution.
<li>Affirmative action programs are absolutely essential.
<li>The federal government alone can do much better than the states.
<li>Term limits are a bad idea.
<li>America is undertaxed.
<dd>Novak  proceeded by explaining that it's easy to see why the media are biased when you have a majority of journalists who agree with these points.
<dd>Some other special guests who attended the meeting included General Alexander Haig; Ed Capano, Publisher of <i>National Review</i>; Oklahoma Senator James Inhofe; and Arianna Huffington, MRC Trustee and Senior Fellow at the Progress and Freedom Foundation.

<center><h2>Letter from the Chairman</h2></center>
Dear MRC Member,
<p>
<dd><big>I</big>t was early one evening and I was sitting with my young daughter, watching what I thought was a perfectly wholesome show on television. To my surprise and horror, the two main characters on this particular program began having an explicitly sexual conversation. 
<dd>Awkwardly I tried to draw my daughter's attention away from the lewd material coming from the television.
<dd>It's a scene repeated in homes all over America every night. The pollution on the airwaves -- even during the so-called "family hour" -- is out of control.
<dd>Like it or not, studies show that children admire and imitate their favorite celebrities more so than their parents, teachers, or religious leaders. 
<dd>And when surveys also show that by the time the average child graduates from high school he or she will have spent more time in front of a television than in the classroom, who is the teacher in society today?  
<dd>That is why the Media Research Center's Entertainment Division is taking giant steps to make television safe for children again.
<dd>For years Hollywood has been pushing the envelope on sexual themes and rough language. Now the networks have almost completely abandoned what was once the "family hour."  Shows still aimed at children contain some very adult-oriented -- and in some cases, highly offensive -- subject matter.
<dd>In February we released our study, <b><i>A Vanishing Haven: The Decline of the Family Hour</b></i>, and have made the networks' irresponsible programming the subject of a national discussion. 
<dd>We've launched a crusade which has gained support from both conservatives like Rep. Lamar Smith (R.-Tex.) and liberals like Senator Joe Lieberman (D.-Conn.) -- both of whom joined me at a national press conference to release this study on the "family" hour.
<dd>Last month I met with network executives in California. John Matoian (President of the Fox Entertainment Group) and had a very productive conversation about the state of prime time. The Senior Vice President of Programming for the Disney Channel, Bruce Rider, reaffirmed his network's strong commitment to family programming. Warner Brothers' Jamie Kellner told me that maintaining family-friendly programming standards was not only good for young viewers but very good for business -- and would be the cornerstone for this new network.
<dd>So there are good signs  that things are moving in our direction. But now is the time to work, and push, like never before. In these pages you'll get more information on our national campaign, all made possible because of your support.
Sincerely,
<p>
L. Brent Bozell III

<center><h2>Family Hour Findings</h2></center>
<dd><big>P</big>rime time television's traditional family hour -- 8 to 9 p.m. Eastern and Pacific, 7-8 Central and Mountain -- traditionally has been home to scores of wholesome series, including <i>Little House on the Prairie, Happy Days, The Cosby Show</i>, and <i>Full House. </i>
<dd>Not anymore.
<dd>The "family hour" is now dominated by adult-oriented shows like <i>Friends</i> and <i>Mel-rose Place</i>, with sexual content and obscen-ities prevalent across the dial. To document how pervasive the problem has become, the Media Research Center's Entertainment Division studied a month's worth of "family hour" shows. On February 8 we released <i><b>A Vanishing Haven: The Decline of the Family Hour</b></i> and opened up a new front in the American cultural war.
<dd>Our study found that certain words and expressions that as recently as the early 1990s were rarely heard on TV -- even late at night -- are now common between 8 and 9. "Kiss my ass," "bastard," and "bitch," among other vulgarisms, are now acceptable in the "family hour."
<dd>Of the networks, NBC easily won the foul-language award. It aired more than twice as many obscenities per hour -- 1.26 -- as any other network. Fox, ABC, and CBS turned in virtually identical per-formances, with each averaging just over one curse word for every two hours of 8-9 programming. The series with the most swearing was NBC's Mad About You, with seven obscenities; the same network's <i>JAG</i> followed with six. 
<dd>Depictions of sexual behavior were just as squalid. The former "family hour" constantly portrays premarital sex as frequent and permissible; in fact, during the study period, depictions of extramarital or premarital sex outnumbered those of sex within marriage by an 8-1 ratio.
<dd>Fox led the network standings with the most sexual treatments per hour, but the other networks were close behind. NBC's <i>Friends</i>, Fox's <i>Melrose Place</i> and <i>Martin,</i> CBS's <i>Cybill</i> and <i>Almost Perfect</i>, and ABC's <i>Ellen</i> and <i>The Drew Carey Show</i> are just some examples of shows with typically raunchy portrayals of sex.
<dd>A Vanishing Haven has gained the support of from both the left and the right. Sen. Joseph Lieberman (D-Conn.) and Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Tex.) joined Brent Bozell at the Washington, D.C. press conference where the MRC introduced the study. 
<dd>After summarizing the study findings for reporters, Bozell discussed a letter sent to the entertainment heads of the television networks calling on them to air only "wholesome, family-oriented programming" between 8 and 9. Signers of the letter were Bozell, Lieberman, and Smith, and six other Congressional leaders: Senators Dan Coats (R-Ind.), Lauch Faircloth (R-N.C.), and Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Tex.) and Representatives: Tom DeLay (R-Tex.), Steve Largent (R-Okla.), and J.C. Watts (R-Okla.)
<dd>"The bulk of TV programming has rapidly grown ruder, cruder, and lewder over the past few years," Sen. Lieberman remarked on the state of network programming standards. "I'm glad to join with the Media Research Center today to call upon the networks to reestablish the family hour...Like any other parent, I don't think it's too much to ask to have one hour [of TV] a night that's junk-free."
<dd>"Many TV shows aired during what should be [the] family hour are corrupting the morals and corroding the minds of a generation of Americans," Rep. Smith stated. "We hope TV producers will live up to their public trust and take their responsibility seriously."  
<dd>Not only did the study garner bipartisan support, it also attracted the attention of the national media. Even they can't disagree that television's programming standards have been heading steadily down- hill. 
<dd>The press conference generated massive coverage. Most networks covered the event; and stories appeared in <i>USA Today</i>, the <i>New York Post</i>, the <i>Chicago Tribune</i>, and the <i>Washington Times</i>. The study also was cited by numerous radio talk show hosts including, Rush Limbaugh and Paul Harvey. 
<dd>The debate is in high gear. Rupert Murdoch of Fox Television has now announced his network will institute a ratings system to monitor sexual content and violence on his shows. In the <i>Washington Post</i>, Bozell called this "a good first step," and added: "This is the man most responsible for pollution on the airwaves. Now he's saying he'll rate his pollution instead of doing what he should do. What he should do is get it off the air."

<center><h2>MRC Stamp of Approval</h2></center>
<dd><big>P</big>amela K. Long, the creator and executive producer of the new ABC family drama, <b><i>Second Noah</i></b>, recently met with Sandra L. Crawford, the Media Research Center's Entertainment Division Director, to discuss the series and ask for the MRC's support; and <i>Noah</i> deserves our.
<dd>Filmed at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay, <i>Second Noah</i> chronicles the hectic lives of Noah and Jesse Beckett. Noah (Daniel Hugh Kelly) is a former basketball coach and a best-selling novelist, while Jesse (Betsy Brantley) is the chief veterinarian at the Tampa Zoo. Mother and father to eight adopted children of various ethnic backgrounds, the Becketts also run an animal rescue operation, taking in abandoned or mistreated ani-mals. With love and compassion, Noah and Jesse face the daily challenges of raising eight children.
<dd><i>Second Noah</i> places great emphasis on personal responsibility and the family unit. The new series is filled with positive messages about honesty, understanding, and love. It respects religion and condemns racism. 
<dd><i>Second Noah</i> is a quality drama designed for family viewing. Since it has a rich and complex cast of characters to provide limitless possibilities for new stories, we hope <i>Second Noah</i> will be around to offer wholesome family entertainment for a long time to come.
<dd>The series airs on ABC, Monday nights at 8 p.m. EST.

<center><h2>CBS's Goldberg: Media are biased </h2></center>
<dd><big>V</big>indication is sweet. For years the Media Research Center has been documenting the liberal bias of the media, often provoking hostile denials by journalists. But now someone has joined our efforts -- and the support comes from a most welcomed quarter.
<dd>In a stunning <i>Wall Street Journal</i> column, CBS News correspondent Bernard Goldberg wrote that "the old argument that the networks and other 'media elites' have a liberal bias is so blatantly true that it's hardly worth discussing anymore." 
<dd>What prompted Goldberg to write the February 13 article was a <i>CBS Evening News</i> segment about the flat tax by Goldberg's colleague Eric Engberg. Engberg used such loaded words as "elixir" and "scheme" to describe the flat tax, "conjuring up images of Doctor Feelgood selling worthless junk out of the back of his wagon," according to Goldberg.
<dd>Goldberg recounted how Engberg spent much of the story saying a flat tax would cause "hideous deficits" without mentioning the role of spending in recent deficit growth. Goldberg also pointed out how Engberg used only a liberal economist for his story, and didn't even label him as liberal, a privilege never granted to conservatives. Goldberg also revealed the networks' dirty little secret: "Part of the problem is that most reporters and editors -- television and print... don't know a capital gain from a mutual fund. This, as much as bias, in some cases leads to the kind of reporting we see on the flat tax and a lot of other economic issues."
<dd>With his temper, Engberg himself probably required several buckets of ice to cool down before pronouncing to the press: "I've never regarded myself as an ideological warrior of any kind."
<dd>And Dan Rather supported Engberg by declaring: "His hallmarks have always been fairness and accuracy."
<dd>Really? See for yourself if these Engberg reports strike you as "hallmarks of fairness and accuracy":
<dd>October 2, 1994, on Newt Gingrich: "From the start, modesty was not his style. Rejecting the House's gentlemanly ways, he waged such constant guerrilla war against the Democrats he was attacked for McCarthyism...the family values candidate who divorced his ailing first wife, the avowed enemy of dirty politics who bounced 22 checks at the House Bank and runs a big-dollar political action committee that won't disclose its contributors." He also called Gingrich "bombastic and ruthless."
<dd>August 28, 1993 <i>Face the Nation</i> question to conservative Rep. Gary Franks: "I know that many of the ideas that you advocate, self-help, up-by-the-bootstraps-type arguments, that has been used for years as an excuse for the government to do nothing, hasn't it?"  
<dd>October 5, 1992: "Feel-bad ads trying to drag down Bill Clinton are regarded as the only hope. In a multi-million dollar assault, Clinton is being portrayed as a duplicitous blobhead who governs a Hee Haw backwater where only the taxes soar. The ads are cleverly worded to suggest Clinton means more taxes." 
<dd>After exposing the Bush ad for relying on "assumptions" that Clinton would raise taxes, Engberg then asked Steven Colford of <i>Advertising Age</i> to describe "the stacking up of assumptions like this, there's a word we use for that." Replied Colford: "I think it's 'lying.'"
<dd>June 7, 1989, on China's Tiananmen Square massacre: "Will the military leaders there be embarrassed by this? Will this be something like Kent State was for our military?"
<dd>April 6, 1989: Engberg charged that in 1985, George Bush "carried promises of U.S. aid to the military dictatorship of Honduras." (Not true: CBS showed video of Bush hugging <i>democratically elected</i> civilian leader Roberto Suazo Cordova.)
<dd>Goldberg's friends told the <i>Washington Post</i>. "He has complained to CBS management about a liberal tilt for several years and has been consistently ignored." 
<dd>Is CBS's reaction to his published charges -- denial and arrogance -- any surprise?

<center><h2>Foreign journalists learn about MRC</h2></center>
<dd><big>I</big>s media bias just a problem in America? It may surprise you to learn that the Media Research Center's mission to encourage responsible journalism doesn't stop at the country's borders. The National Forum Foundation and Delphi International have made the MRC a popular stop for international journalists. The two groups, which arrange tours of the United States for foreign professionals, now regularly bring their guests to the MRC headquarters to learn more about what we do and the unique role we play in American politics.
<dd>Just in the past few months, reporters and journalism professors from Algeria, Austria, Gabon, Kyrgystan, Nepal, Pakistan, Poland, and Russia have visited the MRC. Tim Lamer, Director  of the MRC's Free Enterprise & Media Institute, briefs them on the biases of the American media, what the MRC does to combat those biases, and the crucial role of strong watchdog organizations in a democratic society.
<dd>The questions they ask are wide-ranging and fascinating because they reflect the authoritarian backgrounds of their countries. "Does the MRC advocate censorship?" (No, we assure them, but we believe a free press does not mean freedom from criticism.) "Is the MRC funded by the government?" (No, we're funded by like-minded Americans who recognize the need for a check on the media's power, and who want the media held accountable for what they say and write.) In fact, we inform them, the press cannot truly be free unless both it and its critics are not entangled by government regulations and financing.
<dd>Some have expressed interest in someday starting an organization like the MRC in their own countries. Some have remained, working out of our office in order to learn the trade. Many of them find they can use our research for their work back home. All of them come away with a better understanding of the American media and the American political scene.
<dd>By supporting the MRC, you aren't just making the American media more responsible, you're being a positive influence on the global media.

<center><h2>FEMI editor and the welfare debate</center></h2>
<dd><big>W</big>hile combating liberal media bias is the main mission of the Media Research Center, our staffers sometimes take on other issues as well. Example: Tim Lamer of the MRC's Free Enterprise & Media Institute recently wrote an article about welfare reform for <i><b>The Weekly Standard</b></i>, one of the conservative movement's premier magazines.
<dd>At issue was an amendment to the welfare reform bill offered by Republican Senator John Ashcroft of Missouri. The amendment would have allowed government to contract with religious charities to provide welfare services to the poor, as long as they didn't use the money to proselytize. Lamer argued that the amendment was a mistake on three grounds.
<dd>First, the reason religious charities do well is because they proselytize. If they're not allowed to do that, they won't be any more effective than government or other charities. Second, taxpayers of all religious stripes  -- whether Roman Catholic, Evangelical Protestant, Jewish, Mormon, or whatever -- shouldn't be forced by the government into supporting faiths with which they disagree. Third, conservatives shouldn't be turning more charities into clients of the welfare state unless we want even more groups lobbying for big government.
<dd>Lamer's article ran in the January 15 issue of <b><i>The Weekly Standard</i></b>.

<h3>L. BRENT BOZELL III</h3>
<h3>Franken Privileges: Cheap-Shot Satire</h3></center>
<dd><big>F</big>ew doubt that Al Franken's a genuinely funny guy. He wrote for <i>Saturday Night Live</i> during its golden age in the latter half of the 1970s; years later on SNL, he created and realized the character of wispy self-help sage Stuart Smalley and performed a hilarious impression of Sen. Paul Simon. 
<dd>Alas, national recognition for his ability to amuse apparently wasn't en-ough for Franken, who now styles himself a pundit as well. He says his sporadically laugh - provoking bestseller Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot and Other Observations (Delacorte) is a "satire about the breakdown in the civility of public discourse," but on the frequent occasions when his ideology crowds out his wit, he's unquestionably uncivil in his own right.
<dd>Is Franken a humorist seeking to score laughs or a polemicist out to slay the dragons of the right? To be sure, much of what he writes is clearly satirical. Of an exhibit at the never-built Disney's America theme park that was to have simulated what it was like to be a slave, he quips, "All I can say is that it [would have been] a gross distortion of history to have the Un-derground Railroad loop the loop." Not quite Jonathan Swift, but pretty clever. His political humor can carry a punch. But can conservatives take offense at a chapter titled "Pat Buchanan: Nazi Lover" when we've laughed uproariously at Limbaugh's "feminazi" digs? Not really, not if the intent is satire.
<dd>But that's where Franken fails. There's a certain venom in his pen that transforms humor into spite, and spite undisciplined becomes insult. Limbaugh thus becomes "mean," a "bully," and a "liar"; Limbaugh's fans are trashed as "yahoos" and "f---ing morons"; Buchanan's a "racist"; and anyone who thinks Ronald Reagan was the greatest President of this century is a "f---ing idiot." Casting aspersions on these and other con-servative personalities and causes, Franken's acting as a hatchet man -- no more, no less. 
<dd>Franken asserts that his harshness is ironic, that he's "making fun of meanness...by being mean myself." The problem with that argument is that amidst all the invective in his book, there's virtually no indication that he does not really despise his targets, or at least their politics. As far as keeping up with whether or not Franken is kidding at any given moment is concerned, Rush Limbaugh... is basically a 271-page shell game. 
<dd>Naturally, Franken's choice for the best President of the century is...Bill Clinton. "I was trying to write a scathing piece on Clinton," he declares, "and at a certain point it just became impossible...This kind of thing never happened when I was writing the Phil Gramm chapter." Gramm, on the other hand, is a "bastard" and a "big jerk." (But how dependable is Franken's opinion anyway? He's still trying to sell the long-debunked story that Gramm invested in a porn flick.)
<dd>Franken pulls out all the stops in a chapter concerned with 1) skewering Reaganomics and 2) blasting Limbaugh for his defense of same. Regarding said defense, Franken sneers, "These are the rational, carefully constructed, deliberate lies of a man running a gi-ant propaganda factory dedicated to two things: convincing people who were screwed sideways by Reagan-omics that it was actually good for them, and encouraging the people who turned the screws to feel good about themselves...Reaganomics worked. This is the jewel in Rush's crown of bulls--t."
<dd>If there is an economically sophis-ticated anti-Reaganomics case to be made, Franken doesn't make it, re-sorting instead to Richard Gephardt-like class-envy hackwork. As for most Americans getting "screwed side-ways," Franken apparently forgets that real income taxes paid by 90 percent of Americans fell by 10 percent from 1981 to 1987, while real income taxes paid by the richest five percent rose by nearly 43 percent in the same period. Add to that the obvious (seven years of prosperity; two decisive elec-tion victories for Presidential can-didates running on a Reaganomics-centered platform) and you realize why liberals in the entertainment community behave the way they do: Like Oliver Stone and his movies, Franken cannot defend the principles of liberalism -- so he enters the world of make-believe instead. Creative license, we're told.
<dd>Towards the end of that ill-fated chapter, Franken writes, "I think I'm really breaking new ground here. I mean, did you see bar graphs in Jerry Seinfeld's book? In Tim Allen's?" No, and the reason you didn't, obviously, is that Seinfeld and Allen had way too much comedic acumen to even dream of putting in bar graphs in the first place. There's some amusement to be found in Rush Limbaugh... but considered as political analysis, it is       -- in the derisive, non-funny sense -- a joke.

<center><h2>Letter from the Chairman</h2></center>
Dear MRC member,
<p>
<dd>I predicted that the media would have a field day with the GOP primaries, and that's just what happened. I don't know if there's ever been more negative or slanderous coverage of candidates  than what Bob Dole, Pat Buchanan, Steve Forbes and others have been subjected to this year. 
<dd>The media are complaining about how dirty campaigns have become, yet mud-slinging is the only issue they'll cover.  With all their attacks on GOP candidates, the media themselves are ignoring the real issues. 
<dd>A recent study, released by the Center for Media and Public Affairs, found that in campaign coverage "the networks devoted twice as many stories to the horse race (60) as the candidates' policies (30)." And let's not forget how negative the media themselves are. The same study showed reporters' "criticism of the race outnumbered praise by a 20-to-1 margin."
<dd>One blatant example of this was CBS's Eric Engberg's description of Steve Forbes' flat tax proposal as "wacky."  Even more flagrant was Ted Koppel's charge on Nightline that Buchanan is anti-Semitic.
<p>
<blockquote>
<b><font size=+1>Bozell: "If the media distortions continue to go unchecked, we'll be looking at four more years of Clinton running our country." </font></b>
</blockquote>
<p>
<dd>While the media complain about negative campaigns, they are giving less and less time to candidates who are trying to explain their policies. The same study found that the average length of candidates' soundbites was only 7.3 seconds -- shorter than ever. The study also compared the amount of airtime given to GOP candidates (56 minutes) to airtime reporters spent analyzing what the candidates were saying (5 hours, 45 minutes).
<dd>If the media distortions continue to go unchecked, we'll be looking at four more years of Clinton running our country, because they are doing nothing to expose his record.
We <b><i>must</i></b> make the media accountable for their gaps in the truth and distortions of the facts. That is why the Media Research Center has launched a two million dollar campaign to <b>hold the media responsible for their liberally slanted reporting, and force them to begin to "Tell the Truth."</b> Thank you for helping us. 
<p>
Sincerely,
<p>

<center><h2>MRC Welcomes new PTC Director Harry Medved</h2></center>
<dd><big>T</big>he Media Research Center is proud to announce that Harry Medved, the former National Communications Director of the Screen Actors Guild, has assumed his post as the Executive Director of the Parents' Television Council.
<dd>The Los Angeles based Parents' Television Council is a special project of the MRC. The PTC's goal to restore traditional family values to the entertainment industry.
<dd>"It is a privilege to have Harry Medved join the Parents' Television Council as the Executive Director." said MRC Chairman Brent Bozell in a national statement. "He brings a wealth of experience to the PTC.  Harry knows the industry and its people, and he will be a valuable leader in the efforts to restore family-friendly programming."
<dd>Medved's experience in the entertainment industry is indeed extensive. He is the co-founder of the multimedia company Hollywood Interactive, Inc., as well as the co-author of four books on motion picture history.  During his work for the Screen Actors Guild, he was responsible for overseeing all media relations. He has also co-authored four satirical books on the movie industry with his brother, the well known film critic Michael Medved.
<dd>Harry Medved's broad background provides him with the media savvy necessary to insure that the PTC will have an even greater impact on the debate over values in Hollywood. 
<dd>"I consider this a terrific opportunity to improve communications within the industry on these important issues," Medved remarked. "I look forward to working closely with network executives, producers, writers, directors and actors on this project to build bridges with families across the country."
<dd>Here at the MRC, we are confident that our fight for family values is taking a great leap forward with Medved taking the reins of the PTC.  He will be a valuable asset in our struggle to promote responsible programming, making television  safe for America's children.

<center><h2>FEMI Breakfast Forum A Huge Success</h2></center>
<dd>During his run for the Republican presidential nomination, Steve Forbes called for the overhaul of our hopelessly confusing tax system while replacing it with a flat tax. 
<dd>Reporters continuously savaged the flat tax, ignoring arguments supporting tax reform. Journalists called it "wacky" and "a cruel hoax." They said it would cause "hideous deficits." They labeled it an "economic elixir." They suggested it would add $140 billion to the deficit. They called it a tax increase on the poor, a tax increase on the middle class, and nothing but a tax cut for the rich.
<dd>According to many economists, it's none of those things. But you virtually never hear this side of the story in the news media.
<dd>That made the flat tax a perfect topic for a Free Enterprise & Media Institute Breakfast Forum. FEMI (a division of the Media Research Center) Breakfast Forums are held with the intention of bringing together conservative policy makers and journalists to discuss important economic issues, to acquaint journalists with conservative sources (whom they rarely quote) and their ideas.
<dd>The flat tax forum was held March 13 in Washington and included then-Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes and former Congressman Jack Kemp. In his introduction of Mr. Forbes, MRC Chairman Brent Bozell emphasized that the event was not an endorsement of the Forbes candidacy. 
<dd>Mr. Forbes then proceeded to give a comprehensive overview on the history of taxation in America, then followed it with a thorough explanation of his flat tax proposal. Forbes explained how his plan would not increase taxes on anyone, and how it would cut taxes for everyone. He stressed that the only way to reduce the deficit  is to reduce spending, or have the economy grow, both of which a flat tax would accomplish. Forbes argued that because the flat tax would lower interest rates, it would help homeowners. As for complaints from charitable organizations, he showed how, throughout history, tax cuts have always generated increases in charitable giving by making people richer.
<dd>These were arguments that many reporters, trained on the short soundbite, had never heard. Forbes expressed his gratitude to the MRC for giving him this opportunity to go "beyond 30-second, or ten-second, or three-second soundbites, not trying to play gotcha, but trying to gain true understanding. As we say in <i>Forbes</i> magazine, out of Deuteronomy in the Bible, 'With all thy getting, get understanding.' I appreciate, Brent, this opportunity to help that process."
<dd>The FEMI Breakfast Forum was a huge press event. It drew all three broadcast networks, CNN, and C-SPAN. It also drew major print reporters, such as Michael Barone of <i>U.S. News & World Report</i>, Gerald Seib of the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, and Dan Balz of the <i>Washington Post</i>. 
The forum also garnered stories in the <i>Washington Post, Chicago Tribune</i>, and <i>USA Today</i>, and on CNN's <i>Inside Politics</i>, among many others. The entire FEMI Breakfast Forum was shown on C-SPAN.

<center><h2>MRC Co-Sponsors  CPAC</h2></center>
<dd><big>T</big>he Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), an annual convention held in Washington, D.C., brings together dozens of conservative leaders with thousands of grassroots activists. This year the Media Research Center co-sponsored the 23rd Annual Conservative Political Action Conference. 
<dd>CPAC is host to such groups as the Family Research Council, the Christian Coalition, the Heritage Foundation, and the National Rifle Association.
<dd>It is also a forum for thousands of conservatives from all regions to hear the conservative perspective on the key issues of the day. Noted speakers this year included Bill Bennett, Oliver North, Senator Phil Gramm (R.-Tex.), Congressman Bob Dornan (R.-Calif.),  Steve Forbes, and Alan Keyes.
<dd>The Media Research Center played a major role at CPAC this year. MRC spokesmen met with our members and subscribers at the MRC's CPAC booth where we distributed  a wealth of information. 
<dd>The MRC also hosted an open reception for the CPAC attendees, where our supporters were able to talk with Brent Bozell and other key MRC staff. Bozell also moderated the annual debate between CNN's conservative Bob Novak and ABC's liberal Sam Donaldson. Always one of the highlights of the conference, this debate drew a capacity crowd. 
<dd>It was clear, from so many speakers' presentations as well as the mood of the CPAC attendees, that conservatives are fed up with the pervasive influence of the liberal media and their coverage of politics. 
<dd>It was equally emphatic that the movement sees the MRC as the leader in the fight to expose and neutralize this bias.

<dd><i><blockquote>"I can't tell you how thrilled I am to have been named twice in your December 18 edition featuring the Best Notable Quotables of 1995. To be attacked by a mob of lunatics like your panel of judges is truly an honor. I will cherish it nearly as much as I do the condemnation I received from Louis Farrakhan's followers for criticizing the Million Man March and his recent tour of third world dictatorships. Please select me again!"</i></blockquote>
This is a letter to the Media Research Center from <i>Time</i> magazine's Jack E. White. 
White won the "Damn Those Conservatives Award" in our <i><b>Best Notable Quotables of 1995</b></i> for this quote from his June column:
<dd> "These days Washington seems to be filled with white men who make black people uneasy, like Newt the slasher, Bill the waffler, and Jesse the crank -- Helms that is, not Jackson. But the scariest of all the hobgoblins may well be a fellow African American, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. In the four years since George Bush chose him to fill the 'black seat' left by Thurgood Marshall, Thomas has emerged as the high court's most aggressive advocate of rolling back the gains Marshall fought so hard for. The maddening irony is that Thomas owes his seat to precisely the kind of racial preference he goes to such lengths to excoriate."
<dd>White also made runner-up for the "Embodiment of all Evil Award (for Newt Bashing)" in the <b><i>Best Notable Quotables of 1995</i></b> for this quote:
<dd>"Let's face it: to most African Americans Newt Gingrich is one scary white man...One can only hope Gingrich was sincere in his speech to Congress last week...That could only mean Gingrich is serious about shedding his party's whites-only image. If so, blacks ought to meet him halfway -- if only to temper the impulses of one scary white man."
<dd>Who makes up this "mob of lunatics"? This year the judges for the <b><i>Best Notable Quotables</i></b> included such broadly respected and well known conservatives as CNN's Bob Novak, CNBC's Cal Thomas, and <i>American Spectator</i> Editor R. Emmett Tyrrell; in years past they have been joined by Rush Limbaugh and Charlton Heston.
<dd>Is it any wonder why the public is fed up with the arrogance of the national press?

<h3>Negative Campaigning: Look Who's Talking   The Washington Times</h3></center>
<p>
<dd><big>T</big>he pundits are right.This is the worst year of negative campaigning I've ever seen. These Republican can-didates are being torn apart at the seams. Just sample some of the invective that's being thrown at them on television:
<ol>
<li> Before the campaign really got going, Phil Gramm's campaign was being smeared with a negative TV ad featuring on the screen a New Republic headline labeling Gramm "The Porn Broker" for 18 seconds. When the New Republic's source for the allegation that Gramm had funded a "soft-porn" film in the 1970s repudiated the story, saying "there was no pornography at all," there were no apologies.
<li> Steve Forbes saw his flat tax plan attacked in one campaign commercial as likely to produce "hideous deficits." The ad concluded: "The fact remains the flat tax is a giant, untested theory. One economist suggested before we put it in, we should test it out someplace        -- like Albania." 
<li> The most vicious negative attacks have been aired against Pat Buchanan. One underlined his endorsement by Russian nationalist kook Vladimir Zhirinovsky. 
</ol>
<dd>Another one charged: "It's not that Pat Buchanan today is associated with overtly anti-Semitic or racist acts or statements, but rather that he has  created an image of someone who might be sympathetic to such acts or statements by others." 
<dd>Yet another stooped to attacks on his family, charging his father listened to the anti-Semitic radio show of Father Coughlin, and that his little brothers beat up Jewish kids -- "Christ-killers," they were allegedly called -- in the 1950s.
<p>
<blockquote><b><font size=+1>If they still wish to be the black pot lecturing the kettles on negative campaigning, I have four words for them: Sit down. Shut up.</font></b></blockquote>
<p>
<dd>Yet another ad against Buchanan showed racist nut David Duke at a Buchanan rally, and featured an endorsement from Ku Klux Klansman Daniel Carver. The ad concluded: "A man who says what he means and means what he says and now must fight the embrace of people who think they know exactly what he's talking about."
<dd>As you may already have concluded, these aren't really commercials made by the Republican presidential candidates. Anyone who watches politics knows that were candidates to say these things in their commercials they would be universally scorned -- especially by the press -- for doing so. They are, instead, what the networks themselves have offered us in this campaign. ABC smeared Phil Gramm. CBS bombed the Forbes flat tax. ABC's Ted Koppel and CBS's Bob McNamara hurled bigoted attacks at Buchanan. If we would hound candidates off the hustings for these kinds of attacks, why do we tolerate them from reporters?
<dd>These are the same networks who shake their heads and decry the corrosive negativity of politics. After the recent South Carolina debate, in which the candidates were required to respond to each other's negative ads, the networks all clucked at how unappetizing the prospect was. One wonders if they have considered how unappetizing watching their own programs can be. If they still wish to be the black pot lecturing the kettles on negative campaigning throughout this election year, I have four words for them: Sit down. Shut up. 
<dd>Koppel, for his part, couldn't even leave his attacks at the low level of questioning the ancient antics of the Buchanan children. (This, from  the  man who said of Bill Clinton's draft-dodging thank-you letter: "If we were electing that 23-year-old man, what he said and thought and felt at that time would be germane.") Koppel had help from Time essayist Lance Morrow, who in his magazine likened Buchanan to Joe McCarthy -- "the driving, urgent undershadow of menace." 
<dd>For <i>Nightline</i>, Morrow added that Buchanan's upbringing at the Blessed Sacrament Church and Gonzaga High School was marked by a "reflexive" anti-Semitism of the "they killed Christ" variety. But others who attended high school with Buchanan flatly deny this outrageous charge. You guessed it: <i>Nightline</i> ignored them. 
<dd>Liberal <i>Boston Globe</i> columnist Tom Oliphant has called the liberal media to account on these charges of bigotry against Buchanan, often employing guilt by association: "For liberals to be silent simply because this filth is being directed at a creature of the Right who happens to be on a political roll is intolerable." 
<dd>Already, the media are preparing this story line for the 1996 general election campaign. Bill Clinton, the Great Triangulator, is trying to give the country a better tomorrow, while the Republicans, devoid of vision, have nothing to offer but cheap negative attacks.  
<dd>It's important to declare that negativity has a place in any campaign in defining why one candidate deserves to be elected over his opponent. But let the candidates do that. Decency is also important. It's time the national media attempt to rise to the level of civility these Republican candidates have shown each other.

<center><h2>MRC's Tim Graham Authors Explosive New Book</h2></center>
<dd><big>F</big>rom the Media Research Center's MediaWatch Associate Editor Tim Graham comes a new book entitled <b><i>Pattern of Deception: The Media's Role in the Clinton Presidency.</i></b>
The result of four years of exhaustive research, the book proves beyond a shadow of a doubt how the press has misled the American people by massaging Clinton's image, masking his faults, attacking his opponents and distorting the truth. 
<dd>Using reporters' own words, supplemented by data from the Media Research Center's studies and analyses, <b><i>Pattern of Deception</i></b> not only indicts the media, it <b>convicts</b> them. Starting with the primary campaign in early 1992 and going through to the present, <b><i>Pattern of Deception</i></b> lays bare the undeniable, irrefutable, unmistakable pro-Clinton bias in the national media. 
<dd>The release of <b><i>Pattern of Deception</i></b> officially kicks off the MRC's "Tell the Truth!" campaign to stop the liberal media's shameless promotion of Bill Clinton. We have already distributed over 1,000 books to reporters, columnists, television and radio talk show hosts and producers, as well as to every conservative Member of Congress. We are arming conservatives in the media and public policy with the definitive evidence of how the national press is doing everything in its power to promote Bill Clinton and his left-wing agenda. And we're letting liberals know we conservatives are fighting back.
<dd>Tim Graham is heading up a major television and radio blitz. Within days of the official release, he participated in an interview on the 700 <i>Club</i> with Pat Robertson; a panel discussion on PBS's <i>McCuistion</i>; and interviews on radio stations WSPD in Ohio, KSL in Utah, WTIC in Connecticut, WBSN in Massachusetts, KLIF and WOAI in Texas, WJR in Michigan, WAIM in South Carolina, WTAL in Florida, KSN in South Dakota, WROK in Illinois, WWDB in Pennsylvania, as well as the G. <i>Gordon Liddy Show</i>, which airs across the country. Many, many more shows are lining up to get the message out.
<dd>Get the book that Arianna Huffington, Chair for the Center for Effective Compassion, calls "must reading for the GOP." R. Emmett Tyrrell, Editor in Chief of the <i>American Spectator</i> says <i><b>Pattern of Deception</b></i>, "shows that the press has been easier on Boy Clinton than Gennifer Flowers was." And nationally syndicated columnist and CNBC talk show host Cal Thomas exclaims, "No one is doing a better job of holding the press accountable for failing to live up to its high calling than the Media Research Center. In <b><i>Pattern of Deception</i></b> you'll read how the press have given the Clinton administration a free ride on policy issues which are far more important to the future of lib-eralism than personal peccadilloes." 
<dd>We're offering <b><i>Pattern of Deception</i></b> at a phenomenally low price for Members only. Please see ordering information <a href="#order">here</a>.

<a name="poll">
<center><h3>A New Poll Rocks the world of Journalism</h3></center>
Dear MRC Member,
<p>
<dd><big>A</big> new poll from the Roper Center and the Freedom Forum has rocked the world of journalism. It proves that Washington-based reporters and editors are even more liberal than we thought. Just look at the numbers: 89 percent voted for Clinton in 1992 (as opposed to 43 percent of the public); only 7 percent voted for Bush; only 4 percent are registered Republicans, while 50 percent are Democrats; only 3 percent think the Contract With America was a serious proposal. And get this: only 2 percent call themselves conservative.
<dd>Remarkably, <b>still</b> reporters are denying a bias when given these numbers! I was asked to debate <i>Newsweek</i>'s Eleanor Clift on CNN's <i>Crossfire</i> recently; both Robert Novak and I listened incredulously as she absolutely denied these numbers were evidence of bias. Rather, she said, it proved how good a job the media are doing, since they are being so tough on Bill Clinton.
<dd>It defies belief. It also explains why our work is so critical to the conservative movement. In the past month we've had a host of new programs:
<ol>
<li>After four years of research, Tim Graham's new book, <b><i>Pattern of Deception: The Media's Role in the Clinton Presidency</b></i>, is now published. It proves how the liberal press worked to elect  Bill Clinton for President in '92, how they've championed his agenda since then, and how they're doing it again in '96.
<li>During Holy Week we released our third annual <b><i>Faith in a Box: Television and Religion 1995</i></b>. By studying over 41,000 network news stories and 1,800 hours of prime time entertainment programs in 1995 we have documented the media's  antagonism toward religious institutions, leaders, and doctrines. It's gratifying to know that some in the press are finally admitting it. "I think there is...a problem with what I call cultural bias on these subjects...religion, abortion, and homosexuality," said <i>Washington Post</i> reporter Howard Kurtz. "I think a lot of it is unconscious, but I think those kinds of subjects, most reporters are probably to the left of the American public and probably don't realize that they're not always giving a full weights of views of people who have a very different take on these matters."
</ol>And then there is the MRC's campaign to bring the "family hour" back to prime time television. (The campaign began with the release of our study, <i><b>A Vanishing Haven: The Decline of the Family Hour</b></i>.) The momentum is growing: over 70 Members of Congress have publicly joined our efforts and signed their names to a full page advertisement that ran in Daily Variety, one of the entertainment industry's leading trade publications.
<dd>All three ventures have something in common: none of these efforts has ever been done before simply because conservatives didn't have the organization or resources to undertake these huge projects. In one month we launched all three of them, and liberals' heads are spinning. They've never been hit like this before, and it explains Bob Novak's statement to me at a reception last week. "They hate you, Brent," he laughed. "They hate you more than any conservative in America!"  Given the company that puts me in, I'm honored.
<dd>Thanks for making all of this possible.
Sincerely,
<p>

<b><font size=+1>-"They hate you, Brent. They hate you more than any conservative in America!"</font></b>

<center><h2>Tell the Truth! Update</center></h2>
<dd><big>T</big>he biggest obstacle for conservatives in every presidential election for the past 30 years is the media's unfair, slanted coverage. This year the MRC has announced we've had enough -- and we aren't going to take anymore. And we're putting our money where our mouth is -- a $2 million Tell the Truth! Campaign to expose the leftist agenda of the media.
<dd>The national campaign is in full gear; the MRC is everywhere in the press right now. 
<dd>Our "Blast Fax" press release campaign is providing conservative radio talk show hosts and columnists with daily ammunition exposing media distortions. Rush Limbaugh, Ollie North, Paul Harvey and a host of others are passing this information on to <b>millions</b> on a daily basis. 
<dd>MRC spokesmen are appearing on numerous television and radio shows every single day. They've appeared on CNN's Crossfire, CBN's the 700 Club, National Public Radio, the Oliver North Show, and literally dozens and dozens of others in just the past few weeks alone.
<dd>We have begun distributing Tim Graham's blockbuster new book Pattern of Deception: The Media's Role in the Clinton Presidency to hundreds of conservatives in the media and public policy. 
<p><font size=+1><blockquote>From now until the election you will find these regular updates in <i>FLASH</i> on what the MRC is doing to expose the media's biased election coverage.</blockquote></font>
<p>
<dd>Since Tim Graham began his media blitz for the book, orders have been flooding our office. We are confident from these early responses to the book that <i>Pattern of Deception</i> will be hugely successful in exposing how the leftist media are openly championing the Clinton Administration. 
<dd>Another aspect of our national "Tell the Truth!" campaign includes distributing hundreds of thousands of bumper stickers, pens, and magnets with the logo, "I DON'T BELIEVE THE LIBERAL NEWS MEDIA!" all over the country.
<dd> If you'd like to show your support for our "Tell the Truth!" campaign with one of the MRC's "I don't believe the liberal news media!" items call us at (800)-MRC-1423, and we'll send these out to you for a shipping and handling fee of $2.
<dd>We will also be opening an office in San Diego -- during the Republican National Convention. This year the media will not get away with their blatant distortions and outright lies against conservatives, as they did at the Houston Convention of '92. 
<dd>These are only a few of our plans. Much, much more is being prepared for our friends in the liberal press this year. Be on the lookout in <i><b>Flash</b></i> in the coming months for more updates on our "Tell the Truth!" campaign.

<a name="religion">
<center><h2>MRC Religion Report Generates National Discussion</h2></center>
<dd><big>S</big>urveys show the United States is one of the most religious countries in the world. Every year since 1952, Gallup polls have found that about 90 percent of Americans claim their faith is important. On the other hand, a 1995 U.S. News & World Report survey of Hollywood executives found that only 44 percent considered religion important. Another study revealed that 86 percent of  journalists seldom or never attend church, and 50 percent don't even believe in God. 
<dd>Does the product from the news and entertainment media reflect society's views? Not only do both the news and entertainment media not care about religion, when they do touch on it, they regularly attack it.
<dd>It's all detailed in the Media Research Center's third annual report: <b><i>Faith in a Box: Television and Religion 1995</i></b>, the most comprehensive study of its kind in history. Here are some of the findings:
<h3>Prime Time Entertainment Television</h3>
In 1995, there were almost 1,800 hours of original entertainment programming on ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC, UPN, and WB, but only 287 religious portrayals. Overall, 38 percent of these depictions of religion were positive, and 28 percent were negative -- roughly a 4-to-3 ratio. This near-balance of positive and negative may satisfy secular Hollywood, but it offends tens of millions of Americans who cherish their religious beliefs. 
<dd>If it's a simple expression of faith, 77 percent of the depictions were positive. But the more serious the expression (and the one expressing it) the more negative it became. Religious institutions only received positive representations 31 percent of the time. Only 20 percent of the depictions of the clergy were positive, while a whopping 43 percent were negative! And the laity? Only 11 percent of the depictions of lay religious leaders were positive -- 64 percent were negative! 
<dd>There was a bright side. In 1995 we also had CBS's Touched By an Angel, arguably the most pro-faith show in television history. It's also a bona fide hit, the fastest growing show on their network, and the second fastest growing show on all of television!
<h3>Network News</h3>
<dd>The network news programs virtually ignored religion in 1995. Out of 18,000 evening news stories, religion drew only 249, and out of 26,000 morning news segments, only 224 dealt with matters of faith. For the third year in a row, religion stories again represented only about one percent of the networks' total coverage. 
<dd>The Catholic Church dominated what religion reporting there was, with almost half the evening news stories and 71 percent of the morning segments.  
<dd>In more political terms, the religious right was again portrayed as extreme and damaging to the Republican Party, even though it provided the margin of victory for the GOP in '94. As well, though not a single pro-life incumbent from either party lost that year and dozens of pro-lifers were elected to Congress, the media continued to report that pro-life policies were hurting the GOP. 
<dd>Stories about violence and harassment at abortion clinics drew another 142 stories in 1995. On the other hand, only three stories focused on the violence of abortion itself, or on documented examples of harassment and violence by abortion advocates against pro-lifers.
<dd>That television's treatment of religion has not significantly improved since the MRC's first study two years ago is troubling. The networks wonder why their audience continues to shrink, year after year. When will they begin to understand that their assault on religion is offensive to 90 percent of the public, and maybe, just maybe, might be a factor?  
<dd>Media Research Center Chairman Brent Bozell held a national press conference on April 4 to release <i><b>Faith in a Box: Television and Religion 1995</b></i>. The event was shown live on C-SPAN, and covered by CNN, CBS Radio, ABC Radio, USA Today, the Washington Times, and countless other outlets.
<dd>There has been a tremendous feedback to our work since the press conference aired live on C-SPAN. Viewers across the nation have thanked us for our work on this issue.

<center><h2>MRC's Family Hour Push</h2></center>
<dd><big>I</big>n this election year, with partisan wrangling everywhere, one issue is bringing together Republicans and Democrats: the MRC's campaign to restore positive values on television, particularly during prime time's Family Hour.
<dd>Senator Joseph Lieberman (D-Conn.) and Representative Lamar Smith (R-Tex.) each circulated petitions to their colleagues seeking their support. (Sen. Lieberman and Rep. Smith joined Brent Bozell on February 8 at a national press conference calling on Hollywood to voluntarily return to the spirit of the family hour.)
<dd>Thus far over 70 Senators and Representatives have signed an open letter, calling on Hollywood to voluntarily program only family-friendly fare in the first hour of prime time (8-9 p.m. on the coasts, 7-8 p.m. in middle America). The text of the letter was reproduced in a full-page advertisement in the April 30 issue of <i>Daily Variety</i>.
<dd>Perhaps the most eye-catching aspect of the campaign is the support it has drawn from across the ideological spectrum. Conservatives like Senator Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) and Representative Bob Dornan (R-Calif.) have joined liberals like Senator Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) and Representative Joseph Kennedy (D-Mass.) in backing the MRC's effort.  
<dd>Now it's time for us to target the advertising community. A letter is being prepared for the biggest advertisers on prime time television, asking them to join our Family Hour crusade. Watch this space for regular updates.

<center><h3>Unabomber: Really a Swell Guy</h3></center>
<dd>"I can't bring myself to hate the Unabomber. Quite the opposite; I find his story curiously affecting.[The manifesto] tells us what we all know: that American society can be a powerfully compromising, deadening, even saddening force...If Kaczynski proves to be the Unabomber, he is nobody's hero, certainly not mine. The bomber murdered three people, and might well have many more, all by design. Coincidentally, Kaczynski invaded our front pages just before Easter Sunday, mute, pathetic, and manacled before his captors. But maybe he accomplished what the Unabomber set out to do, to make us think about ourselves, and the society that drove him to madness."--Boston Globe columnist Alex Beam, April 10.

Dear MRC,
<p>
Love your FLASH news-letter! Your group is doing a much better job of keep-ing in touch with your members this way.
I did have a few suggestions:
<ol>
<li>List an E-Mail Address - Many people are like me, too busy or lazy to write a letter. I would love to see an option to send you E-Mail, you would get correspondence more often and it would be more current.
<li>Create a World Wide Web Site - This is a great way to publicize the organization. I get on the WWW often to keep track of other conservative organizations like the Christian Coalition, AFA [American Family Association], etc. I can get timely, quick info on these groups and interest in your group would be very high.
</ol>
Sincerely,
Mickey Mixon

<h3>Russell Amos Kirk</h3><br>
<b>1918-1994</b><br></center>
<p>
"For more than forty years, Russell Kirk was the conscience of the conservative movement. As a scholar, essayist, lecturer, and critic, he saw contemporary political events against the backdrop of history, philosophy, and literature -- subjects in which his background was astonishingly thorough. Following the publication of his masterful <I>The Conservative Mind</i>, Dr. Kirk watched the conservative intellectual revival develop around him until his solitary cause of the early 1950s became the dominant trend of the 1980s. As much as any other living American, Russell Kirk was responsible for the growth of that movement. His works have given the conservative movement sage guidance in its efforts to redeem the time and champion the permanent things."

<P>
Our friend Russell Kirk, &quot;The Wizard of Mecosta,&quot; seemed
an ill-suited visitor to Washington back in 1978. He was accompanied
by his loving wife Annette, and he shared with a packed auditorium
some of the truths that made his published works so powerful and
so influential.
<P>
Then sixty years old, Russell Kirk was not a newcomer to Washington,
and yet he was certainly not a part of this unreal, political
place.
<P>
Despite his visits here in subsequent years, Russell Kirk was
always more comfortable surrounded by his family and his books
in Mecosta. He was at home among inquisitive students on one of
the college campuses where he held visiting appointments or where
he lectured.
<P>
Despite his discomfort, however, he made a real impact on Washington.
In a city of constant change, Kirk reminded opinion leaders, journalists,
legislators and staffers of prudence and of taking the long view.
<P>
It was at an I.S.I.-sponsored seminar, more than thirty years
ago over the Christmas holidays, that I first met Dr. Kirk. He
was already a fixed star in the conservative firmament. Although
he has described himself in those days as &quot;roly-poly and
benign,&quot; all of us students were in awe of him.
<P>
Had we known that he was an occasional eater of beaver and an
habitual smoker of &quot;dark, thick,&quot; Burmese cigars, &quot;looking
and tasting . . . Like torpedoes,&quot; we probably would have
addressed him with even greater trepidation. Yet, as he talked
with a small group of us on that frosty night in Detroit I could
not project that twenty years later Russell Kirk would be a Heritage
Distinguished Fellow and that three of his books would be based
on lectures that he first delivered here.
<P>
Over the years, Russell's Washington lecture themes would include
natural law, the prospects for conservatives, and individual rights.
They are masterpieces of clear thought and eternal truth.
<P>
These volumes and his other works mean that Russell Kirk's influence
in Washington will continue to be far greater than many
of the transient politicians who descend upon this city, cycle
after cycle.
<P>
As a back row observer at his soirees for the last sixteen years,
I never ceased to be amazed by the inevitable overflow crowd of
young people who couldn't get enough of him.
<P>
I asked one of them what his hold was on them. Her reply: &quot;I
had only admired him from afar and, of course, reading his books
at my university was not politically correct.&quot; Or, as a young
Reagan appointee said, &quot;He taught us all why our role was
important beyond ourselves and beyond politics.&quot;
<P>
Russell Kirk's operating guide was prudence and what Patrick Henry
called &quot;the lamp of experience,&quot; which abhorred all
forms of ideology claiming some instant substitute for genuine
tradition, custom, and experience.
<P>
He often described himself as a &quot;Bohemian Tory.&quot; A Bohemian
Tory who adapted to his environment, whether this meant a humble
cellar, a rustic cabin, a city mansion, or one of the great country
houses of Europe.
<P>
From time to time here in Washington, Russell was entertained,
feted, or downright idolized. While he seemed to enjoy this, his
heart belonged to Mecosta.
<P>
Russell Kirk has left an indelible mark on us, on Washington,
and on our nation. Perhaps his words have more meaning for us
today because, as one of his friends, T.S. Eliot puts it:
<P>
&quot;The communication of the dead is tongued with fire beyond
the language of the living.&quot;<A NAME="gleaves"></A>
<P>
<A href="#index">Index</A> <CENTER><B>Gleaves Whitney<BR>
on behalf of <BR>
The Honorable John Engler, Governor of Michigan</CENTER></b>
<p>
 Russell
Kirk once wrote: &quot;Men are put into this world . . . to struggle,
to suffer, to contend against the evil that is in their neighbors
and in themselves, and to aspire toward the triumph of Love. They
are put into this world to live like men and to die like men.&quot;
<P>
By his own measure, Russell Kirk lived a robust and manly life,
and he died a noble and manly death.
<P>
Let it be said at the outset--without hesitation and without qualification--Russell
Kirk was a great man. His work will stand as one of the most significant
intellectual achievements of our time. That is because he understood
our time. Before his most famous book, <i>The Conservative Mind</i>,
was accepted for publication, Russell Kirk wrote a letter to Henry
Regnery, saying: This work is &quot;my contribution to our endeavor
to conserve the spiritual and intellectual and political tradition
of our civilization; and if we a e to rescue the modem mind we
must do it very soon . . .The struggle will be decided in the
minds of the rising generation.&quot;
<P>
There can be no doubt that Russell Kirk reached many minds-- and
touched many hearts--over the last four decades. His words coursed
over the continents and across the generations. He touched us
not just because of what he said, but how he said it. This &quot;Bohemian
Tory,&quot; this &quot;Canny Scot,&quot; possessed an excellent
ear for the language, and his readers felt all the force of his
personality in his prose.
<P>
And then there were the many personal qualities that endeared
Russell Kirk to us. He was a loyal friend and a faithful correspondent.
Who could forget his keen wit, those fantastic ghost stories,
and that mischievous twinkle in his eyes? He was devoted to his
family--a wonderful family so many of us have come to know: his
lovely wife Annette, their four beautiful daughters, his sons-in-law,
and the larger family. For years they have opened their arms to
us, as today we open our arms to them.
<P>
Russell Kirk had an uncommonly generous spirit--a spirit that
never flagged, but gave tirelessly. It is evident in his letters
and lectures, his books and conversation. Weakened though he was
toward the end of his life, Dr. Kirk's last public gesture was
to sign books from his bed, because he knew how much that would
mean to his readers
and friends. The last book he signed, just a week before his passing,
vas to Governor Engler.
<P>
Russell Kirk was very much a Michigan man--one of us. We can imagine
him as a young boy, reading historical adventures by the train
yards in Plymouth where his father worked. We can think of him
as a gifted teacher at his alma mater, Michigan State. We can
see him walking out of that drafty old library at Piety Hill and
turning down the road which leads to the woods.
<P>
Russell loved Michigan. Recently his heart made its final journey
back to the &quot;stump country&quot; that he called his ancestral
home, to return to the land that shaped him. But his spirit now
knows its true and eternal home. And the wisdom in his writings
will remain to help those of us still on this earthly pilgrimage.
Indeed, for generations to come, his words will find a resting
place wherever there is right reason, and wherever there is a
heart in search of the Permanent Things.
<P>
Today we mourn. We have lost a friend. Michigan has lost its preeminent
man of letter. America has lost one of the men who understood
her best. We mourn, but Russell would not want us to become too
melancholy this day. In the epilogue of his memoirs, which he
recently composed and which will be published next year, Russell
Kirk tells us that he lived a good life. At the age of seventy-five,
he says that what he sought in life had come down to three things.
<P>
First, he had sought to defend the Permanent Things -- truth, justice,
freedom, a tolerable moral order and in so doing he was more successful
than he thought would be possible at the outset of his career.
<P>
Second, he had sought to lead a life of decent independence, living
much as his ancestors had lived, on their land, in circumstances
that would enable him to utter the truth and make his voice heard:
a life uncluttered and unpolluted, not devoted to getting and
spending. This, he tells us, he had achieved as a man of letters
at Piety Hill.
<P>
Third, he had sought to marry for love and to rear children who
would come to know that the service of God is perfect freedom.
Words cannot express how filled with gratitude he was for Annette
and his children, who are endowed with the unbought grace of life.
In this, too, he had been wonderfully blessed.
<P>
To Russell Kirk, the three goals of his life had been reached,
and he was grateful. And we who are here today can be grateful
that we knew him, and that he walked a little distance with us
in our journey to our eternal home.<A NAME="pat"></A>

<A href="#index">Index</A> <CENTER><B>Pat Buchanan<BR>
Founder and Chairman <BR>
The American Cause</CENTER></b><p> We are here today to mourn the passing
of a wonderful friend, and to celebrate a great life, that of
Dr. Russell Kirk, Patriarch of Piety Hill, Sage of Mecosta, gentle
giant of American conservatism. And, I am proud and honored to
add, leader of the Buchanan Brigades in the Michigan primary of
'92.
<P>
In 1953, when Dr. Kirk's seminal work, The Conservative Mind,
appeared In a desert of liberal orthodoxy, it was celebrated,
not only here but across the West. For the wise men of the age
were aware something new had been born, a genuine conservative
movement, and Russell Kirk was its father. His was the spark that
set fire to the minds of so many of my generation.
<P>
For forty years, Dr. Kirk wrote his columns and commentaries,
essays, and stories, books and reviews- a treasure house of work
that now becomes part of the deposit of faith--of the cause in
which we believe. And his books will be read and reread and cherished,
when most of what his contemporaries published is long since forgotten.
Why?
<P>
Because Russell Kirk wrote not only for his time, but for all
time. He was the custodian, the caretaker of &quot;The Permanent
Things&quot;, the eternal truths that do not change. All his life
he wielded his pen to expose the false gods of modernity, and
in particular, the false god of ideology.
<P>
To Dr. Kirk, ideology, whether of Left or Right, was something
that took possession of a soul that was empty. &quot;Ideology,&quot;
he wrote, &quot;provides sham religion . . . comforting in its
way to those who have lost or never have known genuine religious
faith.&quot;
<P>
When Dr. Kirk discovered this heresy in the camp of the saints,
he used a needle to winkle it out. A few years back when the ideology
of democracy was being exalted to the status of high dogma, he
wrote, &quot;A trouble with this civil-religion notion is that
the large majority of Americans think they already have a religion
of their own, not one cobbled up by some department in Washington.&quot;
<P>
When some great minds arose in our midst to declare The End of
History, Dr. Kirk merrily laughed. Because he knew more history
than all of them put together; and because he knew that the seedbed
of conflicts and war lay in the human heart, which is unchanged
and unchanging, save through grace.
<P>
As the presence here today of Russell Kirk's wife and four daughters
so beautifully testifies, Russell Kirk did not simply preach the
values of family and faith, he lived them. He not only wrote of
the search for truth, he persevered all his life; and when he
came upon the truth in the Roman Catholic Church, Russell Kirk
embraced it. This was a man, whole and entire, whose hierarchy
of values were in perfect order and synchronization, as are the
planets in God's heaven that circle the sun. And because his values
were in harmony, Dr. Kirk was one off the most genuinely, visibly
happy men I have ever met.
<P>
I recall the last time we met, in Philadelphia near midnight for
a drink after a speech; Annette and Dr. Kirk invited me out to
Piety Hill, to see the library in which he took such joy.
<P>
And, upon occasion, Dr. Kirk would undertake my instruction.
<P>
After listening to me propound the latest economic nostrum for
America's ills, this gentle teacher sent me a slim book that contained
his own introduction: &quot;I have regarded with some suspicion
many practitioners of the Dismal Science,&quot; Dr. Kirk had written.
&quot;I have found economists a blindered breed, worshipping the
false god, Efficiency.&quot;
<P>
Dr. Kirk believed in a market economy, but all his life he fought
this Cult of Efficiency--because it dehumanized man; and because
he knew there is a higher order of things in God's universe, ruled
by a law higher even than the law of supply and demand.
<P>
If today a man should ask me what is conservatism, I would tell
him: Read Russell Kirk. He endures; he speaks to the ages of what
it means to be one of us.
<P>
If there is an image I will carry with me all my days of Dr. Kirk,
it is the image of the loving father of the Prodigal Son, the
father who; nightly, walks to the edge of his estate to look to
the horizon to see if his wandering boy is ever coming home again.
And when the son appears, disheveled, having squandered his patrimony
chasing after the fads and follies of the age, the gentle father,
never reproachful, rejoices to take his son back home.
<P>
He was that--to us.
<P>
&quot;Men are put into this world . . . to struggle, to suffer,
to contend against the evil that is in their neighbors, and in
themselves, and to aspire toward the triumph of Love,&quot; Russell
Kirk wrote forty years ago. &quot;They are put in this world to
live like men and to die like men.&quot;
<P>
A brave man all his life, Russell Kirk died like a man, passing
away in the arms of the wife and daughters he loved. <i>Ave atque vale</i>,
my friend.<A NAME="russell"></A>

<A href="#index">Index</A> <CENTER><B>Russell Hittinger<BR>
Professor, Department of Philosophy <BR>
The Catholic University of America</b></CENTER><p> In <i>The Roots of American
Order</i>, Russell wrote: &quot;Whatever America's incertitudes today,
it is difficult to find American citizens who can sketch any convincing
ideal new order as an alternative to the one long rooted here.&quot;
This sentence was aimed particularly at the malcontents of the
1960s. But it might just as well have been aimed at all of us;
especially those of us who work in universities, think tanks,
and newspapers. Who among us knows so much as to offer the prospect
of any &quot;convincing&quot; alternative to an order long rooted
in the experience of a people? Our answer to this question will
determine how we understand the word &quot;conservative.&quot;</B>
<P>
We know how Russell Kirk answered the question. To his eternal
credit, he did not impart to this movement the name &quot;Kirkianism.&quot;
When he wrote <i>The Conservative Mind</i>, he certainly did not suggest
that the &quot;mind&quot; was his own. The whole point of the
book was to have the reader draw quite the opposite conclusion.
The permanent things are not known by merely one mind or party;
thanks to the gift of culture, they are known by many minds. Whether
we speak of culture in its moral and religious sense, or culture
in terms of liberty and economic markets, the conservative believes
that the kind of social order worth living in most certainly is
not something vouchsafed exclusively to a privileged class of
theorists.
<P>
Russell Kirk kept a distance, both spiritual and geographical,
from the institutions of the elite. He did most of his thinking
and writing outside of the academy. While it seems at least paradoxical
to say this about a conservative, he needed no institutional credentials
to certify his ideas. It was enough for him to call upon the authority
Cicero, Burke, and John Randolph of Roanoke. He certainly kept
a distance from the imperial institutions of this city. Except
for two terms as Justice of the Peace in Morton Township, Mecosta
County, Michigan, Russell never held public office.
<P>
Nonetheless, he had the chief virtue of a public man: he regarded
cultural order as a gift, even if it had been neglected and despoiled
by the age. One might think that it was a great misfortune for
him to have lived in our time, with its rejection of authority
and its rejection of the vicarious communion of the living with
the dead. Russell was, of course, duly critical of the age.
<P>
But criticism was rarely his first word, and never his last. 1
recall the first time I met him, during one of his annual seminars
at Piety Hill. I never, by the way, met a man of his prominence
who spent such time with young people, especially college undergraduates.
That year he was considering the subject, &quot;Is Virtue Teachable?&quot;
After citing all of the classical authorities, and making every
argument (pro and con) of which we were capable, we retired to
the living room on the final evening, whereupon Russell told ghost
stories. I returned more than once to these annual affairs in
Mecosta, and I can assure you that the ghosts always had the final
word.
<P>
When we consider the life of Russell Kirk, we may ask ourselves:
Can a virtuous man be happy in a decadent time? Aristotle said
of Priam's misfortunes: &quot;A truly good and intelligent person
will bear strokes of fortune suitably, and from his resources
at any time will do the finest actions, just as a . . . good shoemaker
will produce the finest shoe from the leather given him . . .
If this is so, then the happy person could never become miserable.&quot;
<P>
And so it was with Russell Kirk. &quot;Happiness,&quot; he concluded
in <i>The Roots of American Order</i>, is first expressed in &quot;gratitude.&quot;
Gratitude is found neither in sadness nor in protest, but in &quot;restoring
and improving the order of the soul and the order of the republic.&quot;
<P>
For his piety, for his example, for his paternal solicitude for
his students, and above all for his sanity, we will miss him.
But we. are grateful for his extraordinary defense of the ordinary,
civilizing virtues.<A NAME="irving"></A>
<P>
<A href="#index">Index</A> <CENTER><B>Irving Louis Horowitz<BR>
Professor of Sociology and Political Science<BR>
Rutgers University</b></CENTER><p> It would be futile, not to say frustrating,
to try summarizing Russell Kirk's life and work in a few well
chosen words. Russell him self was wise enough to leave for paradise
ultimate summaries and judgments. He understood that our world
was comprised, if not shrouded, in mystery and paradox; and hence
in need of dispositions not dogmas. He lived his extraordinary
life accordingly.
<P>
He was a huge public presence with a private life that remained
ever intact. He was a man who wrote fiercely, but who yet managed
to speak softly. Russell gave substance to a movement floundering
in search of theory, and yet only episodically participated in
partisan politics. He was as dedicated to what Veblen called the
higher learning with an unmatched ferocity, and yet chose the
life of what Mannheim called the <i>freischwebende Inelligenz</i> -- 
or loosely translated, the free-wheeling intellect. He was a political
philosopher in the strictest, Burkean, sense of the word, and
yet could produce ghost I stories and aphoristic works with equal
aplomb and ease. And yes, he was Catholic in the exacting sense
of that word, and yet fully able to register a catholicity that
knew no boundaries of religion or culture.
<P>
In short, he was one of us: a human being with aspirations no
less than accomplishments. His conservatism was ample enough to
take the measure of man as a complex bundle of twine; touched
by original sin but in search of ultimate redemption, and filled
with such tumult as to make possible an appreciation of order.
But having said this, one must add a qualifier: Russell did not
use paradox as a mechanism for avoiding decisions or skirting
issues. Better than nearly any I person I have ever known, he
took forthright positions on basic ques tions. For Russell, what
ought to be is at least as important as what is in the conduct
of human affairs.
<P>
I take this passion for the political as his secret war against
empiricism and for moralism. He was at heart, an essayist. He
loved preparing introductions to his favorite contemporary authors:
Irving Babbitt, Christopher Dawson, William H. Mallock, John Randolph,
Forrest McDonald, Donald Davidson, Wilhelm Roepke, Victor Kravchenko, Louis deBonald, George Scott-Moncrieff -- to name some of
them. They spoke at levels that provided meaning without fueling
animus.
<P>
I suspect that this opportunity to dialogue with his friends and
mentors of ages past no less than times present was a large part
of Russell's reason for sponsoring the Library of Conservative
Thought a series wthich has brought such distinction to Transaction,
 no less than pleasure to its readers. He shared with Montaigne
the deep belief that the essay form was that most amenable to
give I expression to ethical considerations. If this made him
at times appear I avuncular, it was a small price to pay for giving
intellectual shape to the struggles of our century and our nation.
<P>
Russell's life spanned much of the century: he knew many victories,
and suffered defeats as well. He handled both ends of the public
spectrum with equal equanimity. I suspect that the warmth of his
private life above all, his unabashed love and beaming pride of
his wife and four daughters allowed him to put into perspective
any indignities, and put into practice his belief in the values
of family, tradition, and faith. There was a seamless movement
from the private to the public that gave an informed unity of
purpose to his life.
<P>
In the short few weeks since his death, I have received many encomiums
about the Library of Conservative Thought. Several of them have
spoken of the series as somehow complete, or near completion,
with his passing. While well-intentioned, this is simply not the
case. That rich body of analysis to which Russell both contributed
so mightily and recovered so consistently, is no more near completion
than the planet earth itself. It would be high irony that a person
dedicated to the search for eternal values in a changing polity
would advocate or announce the competition of such a stupendous
task.
<P>
I suspect that these letters are giving expression to a feeling
of deep sorrow at the loss of a spiritual leader in a spiritless
environment. But the need for the comfort of belief, the instinct
for tradition, the impulse to maintain, if not create order, must
ultimately overcome our sorrow at the loss of a human being, however
talented and whatever achievements he may have registered. The
fact is that Russell is now one with the great tradition he helped
to articulate and recover. He is one with Plato, Augustine, Burke,
Brownson, Calhoun, Eliot and countless other names who helped
Russell give definition to western civilization. May his soul
rest in peace. May our souls remain restless in the pursuit of
peace.<A NAME="honorable"></A>

<A href="#index">Index</A> <CENTER><B>Honorable T. Kenneth Cribb,
Jr.<BR>
President<BR>
Intercollegiate Studies Institute</b></CENTER><p> The priceless regalia
of the Scottish kings--the crown, the scepter, the sword of state--are
known as the Honors of Scotland. They are more ancient by far
than the British Crown Jewels, and it is said that the gold circlet
of the richly reworked crown was worn by Robert the Bruce. Despite
their incalculable worth, the Honors of Scotland were put away
following the union of the English and Scottish nations, and then
were lost to memory for 150 years.</B>
<P>
It was none other than Sir Walter Scott who, understanding their
significance, used all the powers of his scholarship and imagination
to deduce their forgotten resting place. After infinite pains,
he himself lifted the Honors of Scotland from the dusty recess
where they had been consigned by an earlier generation careless
of its patrimony.
<P>
In our age, it was Russell Kirk who, with ground-breaking scholarship
and moral imagination, rediscovered what we may call the Honors
of the West. At a time when the American heirs to conservatism
had fallen into forgetfulness of the great tradition, and liberal
intellectuals had proclaimed its demise, Dr. Kirk, like the Walter
Scott he so admired, lifted with his own hands our forgotten patrimony
from dusty oblivion.
<P>
In his early work Dr. Kirk treated modern exemplars of the conservative
tradition from Burke to Eliot, but always with respect to their
insights into timeless truths. Later, he more explicitly traced
these eternal verities to their ancient historical roots, and
to their Source beyond history. All along the way he erected guideposts
for those who would follow--all of us here and so many others--that
we too could travel the path he had marked toward order in the
soul and order in the commonwealth; that we too could discover
the Honors of the West.
<P>
Friend or foe would occasionally address him as Professor Kirk--not
realizing that he had held professorships no longer than he had
to--such was his contempt for Behemoth University. But teacher
he was, all his life. More than a few volumes on his long shelf
of books were written explicitly to instruct the young, not to
F mention hundreds of college lectures from coast to coast, scores
of Wilbur Fellows who served as his research assistants, or the
Piety Hill seminars begun more than twenty years ago. As with
Chaucer's Clerk, gladly would he teach and gladly learn.
<P>
Russell Kirk also taught by the example of his towering integrity.
Here was the man of letters who, without the usual sinecures,
actually lived by his pen. Here was the scourge of the Welfare
State who quietly practiced the arts of private charity. He and
Annette made their house a home to the troubled, to the dispossessed,
to great eccentrics seeking refuge from the commonplace world.
Who has not visited Piety Hill only to find himself dining with
the deposed imperial family of Ethiopia, or a young person with
grave family problems, or an intellectual expatriated from the
totalitarian East. There was even the Burglar Butler who before
finding shelter with the Kirks, made his way by robbing church
poor boxes, taking--as he said--only what was absolutely necessary.
<P>
Yes, Dr. Kirk taught us by the very nature of the household that
he established, graced by Monica, Cecilia, Felicia, and Andrea,
and presided over by Annette with an encompassing love.
<P>
In January of 1993 Russell Kirk learned that he suffered from
congestive heart failure, and realist that he was, understood
that his remaining time was short. He took the news as no more
and no less than an artifact of the human condition, and in his
last year and-a-half neither despaired in his spirit nor flagged
in his Herculean literary feats. After all, this was a man who
measured his intellectual pursuits in millennia and who planted
trees throughout his life as a symbol of our duty to strive for
good that we may not live to see.
<P>
Well into his seventies, Dr. Kirk could canoe on the rivers of
Mecosta County or walk the hills of the Scottish Borders, only
to sit down later at his typewriter and engage in learned disputation.
This past December nineteenth, Dr. Kirk wrote me, &quot;I fear
that my days of canoeing and hill-walking are over,&quot; and
then proceeded to outline a series of literary projects that daunted
even in the reading. Since the onset of his illness in 1993, he
had produced two of his most important works: <i>America's British
Culture</i>, a consummate defense of our common patrimony against
the destructive sallies of the multiculturalists; and <i>The Politics
of Prudence</i>, a series of essays instructing the rising generation
in the essence of conservative thought and exhorting them to nurture
and transmit their precious cultural heritage.
<P>
But perhaps the most significant work of his last days was the
completion of his final literary gift to us, <i>The Sword
of Imagination: Memoirs of a Half-Century of Literary Conflict</i>.
This 874-page treasure of a manuscript is currently being prepared
for publication by Eerdmans Publishing Company and, according
to Dr. Kirk, is a memoir humbly penned in the tradition of Julius
Caesar and Henry T Adams.
<P>
During his final illness, Dr. Kirk would gather his daughters
around him to tell stories of his youth and of their family history--as
well as an occasional gothic tale. He mustered the energy to read
aloud to his family Walter Scott's <i>Tales of a Grandfather</i>,
and, on Easter Sunday, Chesterton's <i>Ballad of the White
Horse</i>;.
<P>
On his last morning, he heard on the radio that the Pope had slipped
and fallen. He asked his family to pin him in prayer for the Holy
Father's recovery. At the end, he sat up in his bed at his beloved
Piety Hill, and sank back with eyes closed. As Annette went for
the nurse, two of his young daughters took his hands and began
to sing the songs he had sung to awaken them from their a slumbers.
He opened his eyes once more to the angelic voices that sang him
to his rest. His life was gentle in the old sense; his death,
in all senses.
<P>
The final works and days of Russell Kirk were at one with his
long life. From across the ages the best minds of the West spoke
to Dr. Kirk of permanent things which eclipsed the paltry preoccupations
of our time, and he made those thinkers our contemporaries. It
is across the ages that Russell Kirk's own voice will be heard
by future voyagers embarked on the reflective journey toward order
in the soul and order in the commonwealth. May they redeem for
their time, as Russell Kirk has done for ours, the Honors of the
West.<A NAME="homily"></A>

<P>
On Sunday we celebrated Pentecost, and on Monday, I was at Yale
graduation. The contrast between them was extreme. Certainly at
Yale I discovered much knowledge. Certainly at Yale, I discovered
much learning. Yet, with all of this knowledge and learning, was
the lack of moral imagination; and in the midst of &quot;political
correctness,&quot; the refusal of the truth; and therefore the
absence of all wisdom.
<P>
Certainly, there was much talk of &quot;freedom from,&quot; and
lamentably little understanding of &quot;freedom to:&quot; a multiplication
of rights; and a convenient amnesia of duty.
<P>
Yet as Pentecost reminds us, the vocation of a Catholic is to
witness to the truth. To this end, God reveals Himself in covenant;
in sacrifice; in flesh and blood; and through the Holy Spirit.
<P>
Poured out upon the Church at Pentecost, and upon us at our baptism,
that Spirit leads us into the truth, and as we discover the truth,
if we are to live our lives with integrity, we must proclaim it.
<P>
For it is in this fearless proclamation of truth, that we ourselves
learn: from each other; from tradition; from grace; and from that
radical transformation of the heart. Truth comes from the entirety
of the human condition and has been refined and forged in the
inner conflicts between truth and lies; between good and evil;
between the world and the kingdom. And from the proclamation of
the truth, we discover wisdom.
<P>
Given the corruption of human nature, it is, perhaps, too much
to expect gratitude from those challenged and exposed by the proclamation
of the truth, but in the midst of persecution, explicit or implicit,
we see &quot;<i>Cor ad Cor loquitur</i>,&quot; heart speaks to heart.
Like the rim of a bell, it does not matter where it is touched,
for it rings clear, out across the earth. Wisdom speaks heart
to heart, because it perceives not only truth, but the purpose
of truth, which is God.
<P>
Wisdom speaks to the human: body, soul, mind, for wisdom both
understands the truth of the human condition, and is the ground
of its healing. It mines the individual he art for the good for
which humanity was made; for the good of which it is capable;
and for that fragile good confronted by the dark destructive selfishness
of which each one of us is daily tempted to succumb.
<P>
Such wisdom comes from God who is wisdom Himself; Himself the
author, the purpose and the end and it is the birthright of every
Catholic.
<P>
Here in the presence of the author of truth and seat of wisdom
we are given a sign: we see the bread and wine; we perceive the
flesh and blood. We see in what we have made, in bread, in wine,
the seeds of our mortality: the bread must rot and the wine spoil.
Yet we see God take what we have made, and by them, give to us
immortality.
<P>
This sign shows us what God will do, not with what we have made,
but with what he has made: ourselves. &quot;Now we see a dim reflection
in a mirror; but then we shall be seeing face to face. The knowledge
that I now have is imperfect; but I shall understand as I am understood.&quot;
(1 Cor. 13:12)
<P>
&quot;To understand as I am understood&quot; is the ultimate wisdom.
It is still the vocation of our brother Russell Kirk; it is the
lesson of his life; and it is the legacy, like Elijah's mantle,
that falls upon us here.<HR>

<title>NEW COMMANDER FOR THREE-FRONT DRUG WAR</title>

<body>

<p>

<h2>NEW COMMANDER FOR<br>
THREE-FRONT DRUG WAR</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by</i>

<p>

<i>Robert L. Maginnis</i></center>

<p>

The new drug czar, General Barry McCaffrey, is the antithesis
of his boss.  McCaffrey, whose nomination was announced during
President Clinton's State of the Union message on January 23,
1996, is a decorated war hero, a West Pointer who epitomizes 
&quot;Duty-Honor-Country,&quot; and a true anti-drug warrior.
<p>
While McCaffrey's task should be to mount an all-out attack against
well-entrenched drug traffickers, his efforts are likely to be
diluted because two other fronts need attention.   One involves
repairing congressional relationships, and the other concerns
the difficulty of manuevering inside an administration that lacks
enthusiasm for combatting illicit drug use.
<p>
On the second front,  McCaffrey will fight against this administration's
natural inclination.  Many Clintonites feel more comfortable on
the wrong side of drugs and may resist anti-drug changes with
bureaucratic boobytraps.
<p>
On the first front, Congress is skeptical about Clinton's rebirth
as a crusader against the drug trade.   Senator Richard Shelby
(R-Ala.) tried to abolish the drug czar's office, blaming the
administration for sending &quot;a mixed message to America's
youth -- a message that doing drugs is not a crime.&quot;  Shelby
added, &quot;I object to the administration's handling of this
issue -- its lack of commitment to enforcement.&quot;
<p>
Rep. Charles Rangel (D-N.Y.) said, &quot;I've been in Congress
for over two decades, and I have never, never, never seen a president
who cares less about this issue.&quot;
<p>
Most importantly, on the front of ending drug trafficking, McCaffrey
must repair past damage.  In 1992, Clinton promised to renew the
anti-drug campaign, but quickly surrounded himself with pro-drug
advisors and bad policy.  He has cut Pentagon, Customs Service and DEA 
interdiction efforts.  The White House has radically downsized the drug 
czar's office and dropped the drug war to last on the National Security
Council's priority list.
<p>
Now, Clinton has shown a sudden interest in the drug issue.  He
wants drug testing for all arrested felons.  He has rejected changes
to a tough crack cocaine law and recently criticized his liberal
media friends for glamorizing drugs.
<p>
Why McCaffrey? In 1993, during a White House visit, McCaffrey
was rebuffed by a female White House staffer who said she didn't
speak to military people.  Clinton attempted damage control by
taking McCaffrey jogging with him.
<p>
To his credit, McCaffrey is an expert on narcotics trafficking.
He returned to Washington from the military's Southern Command
in Panama, where he presided over U.S. cooperation with Latin
American and Caribbean nations on drug intelligence and interdiction
since February 1994.
<p>
McCaffrey has also said the right things.  He told Congress that
the President's drug strategy &quot;correctly addresses both the
domestic problems of demand and the international problems of
drug manufacturing and smuggling.&quot;
<p>
McCaffrey has clear marching orders.  As the President directed
him in his State of the Union address:  &quot;Lead our nation's
battle against drugs.&quot;  It's going to be tough for this soldier
who is accustomed to giving orders and expecting things done,
however.
<p>
President Harry Truman said of President-elect and General Dwight
Eisenhower, &quot;He'll say, `Do this! Do that! and nothing will
happen.  Poor Ike -- it won't be a bit like the army.  He'll find
it very frustrating.&quot;
<p>
As a fellow West Pointer and former subordinate, I offer this
advice.  Sir, begin your command by performing a thorough mission
analysis, prepare the troops, and then mount a Desert Storm-like
Hail-Mary maneuver to regain lost ground.  Then, exploit your
success.
<p>
Apply the principles of war.  Begin with the principle of security.
Reduce the probability that the enemy might interfere.  Sweep
your perimeter for guerrillas and then identify others who will
impede your plan.  Fair warning, pro-drug partisans are inside
the Clinton camp.
<p>
Define your &quot;purpose,&quot; which means develop a plan that
gains some degree of control over your opposition.  Begin by dumping
the &quot;harm reduction&quot; strategy, which substitutes treatment
for enforcement.  Return the war to the front lines reducing both
supply and demand.
<p>
Maneuver is another principle.  Sun Tzu, the ancient Chinese military
thinker, said there are only two methods of maneuver (attack):
direct and indirect.  Avoid direct attacks on unsympathetic forces
within the administration.  Attack indirectly by going around
them.  Get the support of the American people.  Maneuver to repair
the administration's credibility with Congress and then seek funding
to rearm interdiction forces.
<p>
Use the principle of initiative to take drug abuse awareness center
stage.  Use your allies.  Foster dissent within hostile federal
agencies using natural allies like Reagan-era bureaucrats who
believe in Nancy's &quot;Just Say No&quot; strategy.  They'll
keep pro-drug Clintonites busy while you focus on drug suppliers.
<p>
Declare war on traffickers.  Work with foreign governments to
destroy drug crops, processing plants and their transportation
networks.  Empower the DEA, FBI and local law enforcement to step
up pressure on drug kingpins and street dealers.
<p>
The principle of economy of force requires that you use the minimum
essential resources for those endeavors that require the least
emphasis.  Ask Congress to fund specific drug projects that don't
need your personal attention, thus freeing you for higher priorities.
Canvas the country to reawaken the 1980-era anti-drug activists.
<p>
Use the principle of surprise to attack those who encourage drug
use.  Adhere to the principle of simplicity.  Simple concepts
and clear, concise orders reduce confusion.  This government has
too many anti-drug plans gathering dust and too many chiefs. 
Put your drug fighters in a formation, and insist they stay in
step.  The President will, no doubt, continue to wage a war of
words against promotion of drug abuse in the culture.  This will
make some of them uncomfortable, but it will be your deeds that
turn their discomfort into alarm.
<p>
Finally, the principle of morale is a state of mind.   You must
be confident and determined.   You must demonstrate staying power
and the spirit to win.  Stay visible.   Be a rabble-rouser  --
be a leader.
<p>
America needs a coordinated anti-drug war, and your leadership
can make the difference.  The question is whether Mr. Clinton's
conversion is real and whether, for our children's sake, he will
permit you to lead.

<title>REVAMPING THE DRUG WAR</title>

<h2>REVAMPING THE DRUG WAR</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by</i>

<p>

<i>Robert L. Maginnis</i></center>

<p>

A recent rise in drug use among youth has some national leaders
flirting with the idea of legalizing drugs even though recent
history has shown that anti-drug abuse campaigns -- such as Nancy
Reagan's &quot;Just Say No&quot; program -- work.  Indeed, the
absence of such high-profile, nationalized efforts has no doubt
contributed to the recent rise in drug use among youth.

<p>

James Burke, chairman of the Partnership for a Drug-Free America,
says, &quot;In the last two years, the numbers [of drug abusers]
have gone up dramatically.  We allowed it to happen.  We were
going in the right direction.  We took our eye off the ball.
Kids [today] view illegal drugs as less dangerous and more 
acceptable.&quot;

<p>

Burke attributes the attitude shift to fewer news stories about
the risks of drugs, more pro-drug information, more legalization
discussions, and glamorization of drugs by the pop culture.

<p>

The absence of committed leadership from federal authorities has
also contributed to the problem.  Since taking office, the Clinton
administration has been  pushing treatment rather than enforcement
-- a strategy known as &quot;harm reduction.&quot;  In 1995, the
budget share for interdiction was one-third of what it was in
1985.   Investigations, too, were reduced by 28 percent over this
same period.

<p>

Even though treatment funding has expanded by 119 percent in the
past five years, the number of persons treated has actually declined
by 9 percent.  Additional concerns are raised when one looks at
the distribution of taxpayer dollars within the drug programs.
In 1995, the $13 billion allocated to the war against drugs was
spread thinly among 18 federal agencies and 12 functional areas
(such as interdiction, prevention, treatment, etc.).  All in all,
the war involves more than 140 federal programs, each with its
own bureaucracy.  This scatter shot approach tries to spread enough
money around to drown the problem with resources.  Unfortunately,
only a small percentage of the money ever gets to the &quot;street.&quot;
The majority gets absorbed by infrastructure.

<p>

The vast majority of Americans -- 94 percent according to a December
1995 Gallup poll -- consider drug abuse a serious national problem
and want something done about it.  Large majorities oppose legalization
as a solution and most fault illicit drugs as a root cause of
many of America's social pathologies.

<p>

How bad is the problem?  A 1994 survey by the National Institute
on Drug Abuse found that marijuana use among 8th graders more
than doubled from 1991 to 1994, rising from 6.2 percent to over
13 percent.  A similar trend is evident among 10th and 12th graders
while adolescent abuse of cocaine, crack, heroin, speed and LSD
is also rising dramatically.

<p>

What are the consequences of increased drug abuse?   Andrew Peyton
Thomas, Arizona assistant attorney general and former NAACP counsel,
writes in <I>Crime and the Sacking of America</I>, &quot;There
is...an undeniable relationship between crime and drugs.  Drug
addiction can both lower inhibitions among offenders and spur
them on to other crimes to finance their dependency.&quot;   A
1993 Justice Department study of urban youths over a five-year
period found a direct connection between drug use and delinquency.

<p>

Since 1985, drug-related medical emergencies have skyrocketed
500 percent.   Most of the rise is blamed on heroin and crack
cocaine which are out of control, but the rebirth of designer
drugs like methamphetamine or &quot;speed&quot; is equally startling.
Attorney General Janet Reno said, &quot;[Meth] is spreading
across this country....  There should be no question...that methamphetamine
poses a real and serious threat to the citizens of our nation.&quot;

<p>

The war against drugs doesn't necessarily need more money, but
it does need a major overhaul in emphasis and implementation.

<p><ul>

<li><b>It needs committed leadership.</b> Battles are won tactically
but wars are won strategically.  A winning strategy requires a
leader with vision.  Presidents Bush and Clinton have given responsibility
to a drug czar who has virtually no authority.  One cannot delegate
responsibility unless one delegates commensurate authority to
get the job done.  The President must give this issue a constantly
high profile.

<p>

<li><b>It needs a single responsible federal agency emphasizing
interdiction and prevention.</b> The new drug czar, General Barry
McCaffrey, promises to reorganize his office into &quot;a more
effective mechanism.&quot;  But the drug war needs more than a
reshuffling of the czar's deck chairs.  He should be subordinate
to the Attorney General like the Surgeon General falls under the
Secretary for Health and Human Services.  That would eliminate
redundancies and improve the use of taxpayer dollars. He should
coordinate America's drug interdiction effort and speak out against
abuse.  Let local communities do the rest.  They can do a far
better job than the federal government.

<p>

<li><b>It needs focus on faith-based treatment programs.</b>
Let faith-based organizations tailor prevention and treatment
to local needs.  The best drug abuse prevention and treatment
programs are faith-based, yet they are often denigrated by federal
bureaucrats.

</ul><p>

To desert the war in the face of rising drug abuse is wrong.
Instead, the drug war must refocus on committed leadership, government
interdiction and prevention, and faith-based treatment programs.

<title>ADOLESCENT MARIJUANA ABUSE GOES HIGHER</title>

<p>
<h2>ADOLESCENT MARIJUANA<br>
ABUSE GOES HIGHER</h2></center>
<hr size = 3 width = 50%>
<p>
According to the 1994 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse
(NHSDA),  marijuana use among 12-17 year olds nearly doubled from
1992 to 1994.  The number of teenagers who believe they risk harm
by using marijuana has decreased.[1]
<p>
Four-fifths (10 million) of current illicit drug users use marijuana
and the highest rate of drug use is now among persons 16 to 21
years old.  They tend to be unemployed and lack a high school
diploma. 
<p>
Since the 1970's, the NHSDA has been the primary source of statistical
information on the use of illegal drugs in the United States.
 It is based on a nationally representative sample of the civilian
noninstitutionalized population age 12 and older. 
<p>
Similar results were found in a 1994 survey by the National Institute
on Drug Abuse (NIDA).  It found that marijuana use among 8th graders
rose from 6.2 percent in 1991 to 13 percent in 1994.  A similar
trend was evident among 10th and 12th graders.[2]
<p>
Both 1994 surveys found declines in the proportion of adolescents
who believe they risk harm by using marijuana occasionally has
decreased.  But White House Drug Policy Director Lee P. Brown
said, marijuana is &quot;a very dangerous drug that can cause
you to fight for your health and your life.&quot;[3]
<p>
Although some young people don't even consider marijuana a &quot;drug,&quot;
Dr. Carlton Turner, former NIDA director and head of the Marijuana
Research Project at the University of Mississippi, warns, &quot;There
is no other drug used or abused by man that has the staying power
and broad cellular actions on the body that cannabis [marijuana]
does.&quot;[4]
<p>
The short-term effects of marijuana include impairment in learning
and memory, perception, judgment and complex motor skills.  The
drug can cause difficulty in speaking, listening effectively,
thinking, retaining knowledge, problem-solving and forming concepts.
<p>
Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala states, &quot;Young
people must understand that there is clear scientific evidence
that marijuana is a dangerous drug that can have acute and hazardous
effects.&quot;[5] More than 10,500 published scientific papers show
that marijuana damages brain cells, the lungs, may adversely affect
reproduction in women and fertility in men, endangers the unborn
baby and newborns of pot-smoking women, and could damage the heart.

HOW TO KEEP KIDS DRUG FREE</h2>

<i>Robert L. Maginnis</i></center>
<p>
The recent dramatic rise in drug abuse is fueled by a pro-drug
culture, generational forgetfulness and crippled prevention programs.
 The problem demands renewed grassroots attention by parents,
community involvement and aggressive, private and public, national
anti-drug leadership.
<P>
Drug abuse is symptomatic of  numerous social pathologies such
as rampant fatherlessness which afflicts 18 million American children.
 And abuse has personal and cultural consequences:  increased
crime, poorer health, lowered productivity, and significant costs
to the nation in health and welfare support.  Curbing this scourge
must become a national priority.
<P>
This paper will profile the drug abuse problem, the culture's
contribution to that problem, the parents' role and the history
and future of organized, drug prevention programs.
<P>
<center><h3>A RISE IN DRUG ABUSE PORTENDS MORE VIOLENCE</h3></center>
<P>
A 1994 survey by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) found
that marijuana use among 8th graders rose from 6.2 percent in
1991 to 13 percent in 1994.  A similar trend is evident among
10th and 12th graders.  Adolescent abuse of cocaine, crack, heroin,
and LSD is also rising.[1]
<P>
The Parents' Resource Institute for Drug Education (PRIDE) reports
that the U.S. is in the midst of a new wave of adolescent drug
abuse.  Associated with this increase is more violent behavior.
 PRIDE found that children who use alcohol, marijuana, hallucinogens,
and/or cocaine are significantly more likely to carry a gun to
school, take part in gang activities, attempt suicide, threaten
to harm another, and get in trouble with the police than children
who abstain from drugs.[2]
<P>
The Supreme Court agrees that there is a relationship between
drug abuse and juvenile crime.   On June 26, 1995, in the case
of <I>Vernonia School</I>
<I>District v. Acton,</I> the court decided  that school-sponsored
drug testing is constitutional, giving local officials a tool
to fight the problem.[3]
<P>
The Vernonia School District told the high court that disciplinary
problems had reached &quot;epidemic proportions.&quot;   The school
administration concluded that rebellion in the classroom was fueled
by alcohol and drug abuse and that student athletes were the leaders
of the drug culture.   
<P>
After a parent &quot;input night&quot; to discuss a proposed drug
test policy for athletes, the parents present gave unanimous approval.
 The policy's purpose is to &quot;prevent student athletes from
using drugs, to protect their health and safety, and to provide
drug users with assistance programs.&quot;  The high court okayed
athlete drug testing. 
<P>
<center><h3>A PRO-DRUG CULTURE</h3></center>
<P>
Andrew Peyton Thomas, Arizona assistant attorney general and a
former NAACP counsel, writes in <I>Crime and the Sacking of America,
&quot;</I>There is ... an undeniable
relationship between crime and drugs.  Drug addiction can both
lower inhibitions among offenders and spur them on to other crimes
to finance their dependency.&quot;  He argues that in spite of
the synergism of crime and drugs, analysts cannot conclude that
drugs cause crime.  In fact, drugs &quot;do not ingest themselves
... Drugs reach their human hosts only after being invited.&quot;
  What then leads children to use drugs?[4]
<P>
James Burke, chairman of the Partnership for a Drug Free America,
told delegates at the May 1995 American Cities Against Drugs Convention
in Atlanta that in 1962 there were fewer than four million people
who tried illegal drugs.  By 1993, this number had grown to 80
million who had tried drugs, with six million in various stages
of addiction.[5]
<P>
According to Burke, attitudes drive drug abuse:  &quot;In the
last two years, the numbers [of drug abusers] have gone up dramatically.
 We allowed it to happen.  We were going in the right direction.
 We took our eye off the ball.  Kids [today] view illegal drugs
as less dangerous and more acceptable.&quot;[6]  Burke attributes
the attitude shift to fewer news stories about the risks of drugs,
more pro-drug information, more legalization discussions, and
reglamorization of drugs by the music industry.
<P>
A national survey released by the Center on Addiction and Substance
Abuse at Columbia University supports Burke's contention.  It
found that 76 percent of adolescents and 67 percent of adults
blame the popular culture -- television shows, movies, magazines,
and popular music -- for encouraging illegal drug use.  One-third
of the adolescents also said that drugs are the most important
problem facing them.[7]
<P>
The Washington pollster who did the survey, Frank Luntz, explains,
&quot;It's not parents talking about children.  It's kids talking
about themselves.&quot;  The polls show that respondents feel
that the entertainment industry helps to create an environment
in which drug use is not stigmatized.[8]
<P>
Other pro-drug influences are working to transform the culture.
 For example, youth clothing manufacturers like Adidas produce
shoes called &quot;Chronic,&quot; which are made from hemp and
named after the slang term for a marijuana-packed cigar.[9]
<P>
Cultural icons like baseball star Darryl Strawberry undercut anti-drug
messages. Strawberry is an admitted cocaine addict and alcoholic
who has been jailed for spousal abuse and convicted of fraud.
 Although his former manager, Tommy Lasorda of the Los Angeles
Dodgers, said Strawberry ought to be in jail, not playing baseball,
New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner recently signed Strawberry
to a new contract.  Lee Brown, Office of National Drug Control
Policy director, said that Steinbrenner's decision tells our youth,
&quot;If you use drugs, you can be rewarded with big money in
big-time sports ... It is no wonder kids may think that star athletes
are into drugs and there are no real penalties.&quot;[11]
<P>
Even television news programs have taken up the pro-drug banner.
 ABC aired &quot;America's War on Drugs -- Searching for Solutions&quot;
on April 6, 1995.  It includes a litany of distortions such as
the unproven notion that legalizing drugs will reduce crime  and
that drug treatment is a better alternative than enforcement.[12]
<P>
Former CBS news anchor Walter Cronkite hosted a <I>Discovery Channel</I>
program entitled &quot;The War on Drugs.&quot;   The June 20,
1995 documentary sympathetically profiles the plight of jailed
drug offenders, declares the drug war lost, and calls on President
Clinton to form a bipartisan commission with sweeping powers to
reappraise the war.
<P>
<I>NBC Nightly News</I> profiled a commentary by marijuana advocate
Dr. Lester Grinspoon which appeared in the June 1995 <I>Journal
of the American Medical Association</I>.[13]  The NBC &quot;Health
News&quot; segment by Robert Bazell interviewed many people who
claim marijuana helps them with medical problems that include
AIDS, multiple sclerosis, glaucoma, and cancer.  NBC ignores more
than 10,500 scientific studies which chronicle the adverse consequences
of marijuana use.[14]
<P>
<center><h3>GENERATIONAL AMNESIA</h3></center>
<P>
The drug crisis of the 1970s was reversed by the parents of the
1980s who took charge.  They became involved in their children's
lives, forced schools and community organizations to join the
fight, and supported efforts by President and Mrs. Reagan, who
promised to make drug fighting a national priority.
<P>
Gary Fields, school superintendent in Zion, Illinois, believes
that today's teens are being raised by &quot;drugged parents&quot;
who struggle with their own abuse history and often enable their
children.  He says these parents must stop denying the problem
and he encourages them to give their children a strong anti-drug
message at home.  Otherwise, he says, school-based prevention
programs won't work.[15]
<P>
Southern Methodist University professor Robert Hampson studies
child and adolescent behavior.  He says that parental involvement
in drug-abuse prevention is critical to helping children stay
drug free.  &quot;A healthy family,&quot; he explains, &quot;is
one in which the children respect their elders, older siblings
serve as strong role models, communication lines remain open and
parents remain open, and parents feel empowered to shape their
children's lives.&quot;[16]
<P>
Deborah Cohen of Louisiana State University Medical Center led
a study to identify specific parenting behaviors associated with
the onset of alcohol and tobacco use.  Cohen's 1994 study, published
in <I>Pediatrics,</I> found that children who reported that parents
spent more time with them and communicated with them were less
likely to use alcohol and tobacco.[17]  Another 1994 study in
<I>Pediatrics</I> found that parental monitoring is an effective tool 
in the prevention of drug use.[18]
<P>
Research has identified numerous risk factors that contribute
to adolescent drug abuse.  They include:  availability of drugs,
family and community mobility, community safety, parental drug
use or attitude toward drugs, and level of supervision.
<P>
The Virginia Council on Coordinating Prevention found that most
children who defy the odds of becoming drug abusers &quot;have
had the opportunity to establish a close bond with at least one
person who provided them with stable care and from whom they received
adequate and appropriate attention during the first year of life.&quot;
 A caring and supportive relationship remains the most critical
variable throughout childhood and adolescence.  In fact, even
for those from a troubled home environment, &quot;a good relationship
with one parent&quot; provides a substantial protective effect.[19]
<P>
Rosemary Hinojosa recognizes the need to empower parents to rear
resilient children.  She is the executive director of La Familia
Fuerte [Strong Family], a drug abuse prevention program for Mexican-American
children in Dallas, Texas.  Her program takes a holistic approach
which involves parents in keeping children drug free.  She educates
parents on child-rearing, health, and substance abuse issues.[20]
<P>
&quot;We're trying,&quot; Hinojosa says, &quot;to help the families
draw from their own strengths and allow them to see they have
those strengths, so when we're gone, they can fall back on them.&quot;[21]
<P>
Hinojosa's focus on the home is proper, but some children don't
have parents who are willing or prepared to guide them away from
drugs.  In these cases, when parents fail, government has become
a poor substitute.
<P>
<center><h3>HISTORY OF DRUG PREVENTION</h3></center>
<P>
Drug abuse is an international problem.  For example, in the 1960s,
then-Chinese Premier Chou En-lai told Egyptian President Gamal
Abdel Nasser, &quot;We are getting back at the West now.  We are
helping the Vietnamese make drug slaves of the American GIs with
heroin and hashish.&quot;[22]
<P>
Chou En-lai blamed the 19th-century British [translated &quot;the
West&quot;] for smuggling opium into China, leaving 90 million
opium addicts.  Hoping to curb the opium supply, the Chinese &quot;illegally&quot;
disposed of tons of British opium.  The British responded by starting
the First Opium War, which was settled in their favor after China
ceded Hong Kong.  
<P>
The Chinese opium plague wasn't resolved until the 1950s and only
after unprecedented public health efforts.   Neighboring Japan
fought an amphetamine epidemic that began during World War II
with government encouragement in order to keep war factories producing
and men fighting.  They were sold without prescription for &quot;elimination
of drowsiness and repletion of the spirits.&quot;
<P>
In 1951, the Japanese government passed the Awakening Drug Control
Law to deal with the nearly two percent (750,000) of the population
who were abusing amphetamines.  The law began a successful three-year
campaign to eradicate the abuse through treatment, education and
stiff penalties.[23]
<P>
Singapore had a heroin epidemic in the late 1970s.  Poh Geok Ek,
director of the Central Narcotics Bureau, states, &quot;The situation
called for immediate action; otherwise, heroin, like an infectious
disease, would spread like wildfire.&quot;[24]
<P>
Singapore adopted harsh laws that called for the death penalty
for trafficking more than 15 grams.  Between 1980 and 1985, 15
people were hanged.   That country also embraced large-scale and
mandatory &quot;cold-turkey&quot; drug rehabilitation.  Poh explained:
 &quot;Our aim is to persuade the addict that he no longer needs
the drug and finally to give him an incentive to replace the drug
with a more satisfying way of life.&quot;
<P>
The Singaporean rehab model includes indoctrination and a military-style
exercise regimen, followed by six months in a halfway house and
two years of close drug supervision.  Today, Singapore has one
of the lowest drug abuse rates in the world.
<P>
 The American Civil War (1861-1865) created a morphine epidemic.
 Many soldiers who were treated with morphine for battlefield
wounds became addicted.  After the war, local drugstores and mail-order
firms like Sears Roebuck legally sold opium or morphine, and by
the beginning of the 20th century, one percent of the U.S. population
were opium addicts.[25]
<P>
The U.S. has fought the opium trade for most of two centuries.
 America signed a treaty with Siam in 1833 acknowledging the need
to curb the flow of opium.  President Teddy Roosevelt organized
the 1909 Shanghai Convention to control the production, manufacturing,
export, import, and distribution of narcotics.[26]
<P>
The U.S. pushed for an international meeting in the Netherlands,
which produced the Hague Opium Convention in January 1912.  That
treaty included, for the first time, control over cocaine.  The
Hague Treaty provided the basis for the 1914 Harrison Narcotics
Bill, which committed the U.S. to controlling drug trafficking.
<P>
After World War II, heroin emerged as a major problem in America's
inner cities.  The government responded by embracing treatment
modalities, including methadone maintenance, therapeutic communities,
and outpatient care.  Politicians passed abstinence laws and created
a phalanx of anti-drug forces.  Meanwhile, educators joined the
fray by stressing information about types of drugs and the negative
consequences from their use.  Proponents of this approach argued
that teens used illicit drugs because they were ignorant of their
harmful nature.  
<P>
This scare tactic approach was replaced by values clarification
(teaching social and personal skills). Today, most programs are
characterized as risk based protective factor type approaches.
<P>
School-based programs designed to prevent drug abuse have been
an integral part of the nation's anti-drug effort for more than
two decades.  Drug education is a $2 billion industry replete
with teachers' seminars and anti-drug texts.  Most of the money
comes from block grants for counseling, and social work.  Yet
there is conflicting evidence whether these programs really make
a difference.
<P>
The President's 1995 National Drug Control Strategy paper concludes
&quot;that only prevention efforts can bring about a long-term
solution to the problem of illicit drug use and its consequences.&quot;[27]
 The paper argues that there has been significant progress since
1979 in reducing casual use of illicit drugs -- from 24 million
to 12 million users -- and that prevention programs have played
a critical role.  
<P>
The National Structured Evaluation (NSE) of Alcohol and Other
Drug Abuse Prevention, sponsored by the Center for Substance Abuse
Prevention, recently concluded an analysis of hundreds of prevention
efforts.  The NSE found that effective programs emphasize personal
skill development, provide social sanctions and rewards that discourage
drug use and for adolescents at risk, provide professional individual
and family counseling.
<P>
 According to the NSE, there are seven typical prevention approaches.[28]
<UL>
<LI>Positive decisionmaking:  Helps develop personal skills for
preadolescent children.  It is in a quarter of all programs and
is a common school-based program.
<LI>Safety/health skills:  The least common, it provides skills
development and drug lectures.
<LI>Psychosocial skills:  Focuses on personal skill development
without fact-based drug lectures.  Accounts for 10 percent of
the programs.
<LI>Counseling intensive:  Provides individual and family intervention
and drug information.  Accounts for 10 percent of the programs.
<LI>Case management:  Focuses on individual needs to include health
care and addiction counseling.  Accounts for 7 percent of the
programs.
<LI>Multidirectional:  Combines many activities, personal skills
development, skills training, drug information lectures, and alternative
drug-free recreation.  Accounts for 13 percent of the programs.
<LI>Environmental change:  Provides training, changes law or enforcement
patterns, and alters the physical setting.  Accounts for one-third
of the programs.
</UL>
<P>
<center><h3>DRUG PREVENTION PROGRAMS</h3></center>
<P>
The Federal Government funds and oversees drug prevention through
efforts like the Department of Education's Safe and Drug-Free
Schools and Communities Program.   One of the best known is Project
D.A.R.E. (Drug Abuse Resistance Education).  
<P>
DARE is distinctive because of its widespread adoption nationwide;
its use of uniformed policemen teaching in local schools; and
its local control.  
<P>
DARE was created in 1983 by the Los Angeles Police Department
for grades K-12.  It uses a core curriculum consisting of 17 hour-long
weekly lessons, usually offered in 45- to 60-minute blocks.  DARE
focuses on teaching skills to resist social pressures to use drugs,
making decisions, building self-esteem, and choosing healthy alternatives
to drug use.  The programs for high school students address additional
topics like conflict resolution, gang prevention, parent education,
and after-school recreation.
<P>
The Research Triangle Institute (RTI) in cooperation with the
National Institute of Justice studied DARE's effectiveness.  Their
study found that DARE is popular and that many DARE  coordinators
plan to expand the program.  Many districts without the program
want to adopt it.
<P>
But RTI's meta-analysis found that DARE does not reduce drug use
despite its success in increasing student knowledge about substance
abuse and enhancing their social skills.[29]  William Midzelski, a
U.S. Department of Education drug education specialist, said,
&quot;It's well established that DARE doesn't work.&quot;[30]
<P>
Phyllis Ellickson, a Rand Corporation researcher, states, &quot;DARE
has a following and sales force that is extremely powerful in
fighting for scarce resources.  But its growth is totally out
of scale to its effectiveness.&quot;[31]
<P>
The Drug Policy Foundation (DPF) hosted a conference in Washington,
D.C. in November 1994.  A seminar entitled &quot;Truth or DARE&quot;
featured two activist parents critiquing DARE.  Richard Evans
of  Northhampton, Massachusetts, says DARE does not define drug
abuse and relies on values clarification.  According to Evans,
teachers like DARE because it gives them a free hour each week.
 Local police like DARE because it gets them into the lives of
children.  And politicians like DARE because it makes them look
like they are doing something.
<P>
The other DPF panelist was Steve Wallace of Chapel Hill, North
Carolina, who complained that DARE officers scare kids.  He said
that DARE consumes $600 to $700 million each year but doesn't
help children learn.
<P>
Despite the fact that the program has demonstrated limited success,
DARE has many supporters.  Glenn Levant, DARE's executive director,
states, &quot;Scientists will tell you bumble bees can't fly,
but we know they can.&quot;  Steve Rusiniak, a youth-bureau detective
in Wayne, New Jersey who has taught DARE classes for three years
states, &quot;I do know, because I've heard back from many kids
and their families, that DARE has established a good rapport.
 DARE has done something.  I'm not claiming that DARE is the answer,
but it's part of it.&quot;[32]
<P>
Less publicized prevention programs have shown promising results.
 Project Smart, founded in 1981, teaches children to resist peer
pressure, to interpret advertisements for alcohol and cigarettes,
and to practice saying no to drugs through role playing.[33]
<P>
Drug Strategies president Mathea Falco touts the successes of
Project Star.  She claims in her 1992 book, <I>The Making of a
Drug-Free America,</I> that there was a 30 percent drop
in drug abuse among adolescents in a Kansas City test.[34]
<P>
High-Scope curriculum advocates claim that 70 percent of their
inner city graduates stay away from drug dealing compared to peers
who hadn't participated.  This program includes a weekly 90-minute
home visit from counselors who focus on teaching parents how to
parent.[35]
<P>
The Archdiocese Drug Abuse Prevention Program (ADAP) is based
in the Bronx.  The curriculum focuses on group prevention counseling.
 According to executive director Sally Ann Shields, &quot;Information
does not change behavior.  It's the development of skills and
the relationships with counselors [that change behavior].&quot;[36]
<P>
ADAP is recognized by the federal government's Center for Substance
Abuse Prevention (CSAP) as one of the nation's best prevention
programs.  ADAP claims that 91 percent of participants significantly
reduced or eliminated drug and alcohol use and 79 percent of the
adolescents improved their grades and behavior at school.[37]
<P>
The President's National Drug Control Strategy states, &quot;America's
faith community can play an important role in finding solutions
to the related issues of drugs and violence.&quot;[38]  In fact, ONDCP
has called for a meeting of faith community leaders before the
end of 1995.
<P>
Religion-based drug treatment and prevention programs have been
especially successful.  Freddy Garcia, an ex-addict, has spent
the last 30 years helping inner city children fight drug addiction.
 He claims a 60 percent success rate using teaching on marriage
and the family, practical Christian living, Biblical counseling
skills, and love.  His staff includes ex-addicts, because, as
Garcia says, &quot;The man who has come back from the precipice
can best show others the way.&quot;  Garcia's &quot;Victory Mission&quot;
has 60 branches and has treated over 13,000 substance abusers.[39]
<P>
U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich named Garcia to a citizens' group
to recommend solutions to problems like poverty, crime, substance
abuse, and teen sex.  He said of Garcia, &quot;Freddy Garcia has
achieved results that are almost unheard of ... rather than studying
him, all too often the bureaucracy has tried to put folks like
Freddy out of business because they don't have a Ph.D. or they
don't fill out the paperwork right.&quot;[40]
<P>
Teen Challenge is a religion-based drug treatment and prevention
program that claims that 86 percent of individuals who go through
their program remain drug free.[41]  The basic philosophy is, &quot;We
believe that sincere faith in Christ is the motivation needed
to extract the deep-rooted symptoms that cause dependence on narcotics.&quot;
[42]
<P>
Characteristics shared by successful programs include parental
involvement, knowledge of drugs and their dangers, positive social
activities, positive role models, rewards and recognition for
youth interests, and an overall caring and supportive environment
in communities with integrated health, social service, and educational
systems.
<P>
<center><h3>THE FUTURE OF DRUG PREVENTION</h3></center>
<P>
The Oakland, California based &quot;Just Say No&quot; International
called on the Clinton Administration to look at youth drug-abuse
prevention as an economic issue as well as a social health issue.
 It found that over one-third of America's youth are at risk of
succumbing to drug use.[43]
<P>
Volunteer chairman and Hewlett-Packard executive Jack Brigham
cites his organization's survey of 6,404 youth educators, administrators
and other service providers, stating, &quot;The survey findings
confirm that youth drug-abuse prevention must be viewed by the
federal government not only as a social health issue, but as an
economic issue critical to the long-term economic health of this
nation.&quot;[44]
<P>
But Shirley Higgins, a communication specialist with the anti-drug
organization InTouch, told Speaker Newt Gingrich in a recent letter,
&quot;While the federal government has a vital role to play, we
have got to stop engaging in the fantasy that the federal government
can rescue us from our addictions, our community apathy where
it exists, our lack of self-responsibility and our lack of a vision
of a future that goes beyond the next five years.&quot;[45]
<P>
The Parents' Resource Institute for Drug Education (PRIDE) subscribes
to three basic beliefs with regard to any future solution.  First,
it believes that parents have a strong instinct to protect their
children.  All we need to do is help parents to understand the
harmful effects of drugs, understand their child's social pressures
and help them develop an action plan.[46]
<P>
Second, our youth have a &quot;goodness of heart&quot; or a deep
care and concern for their peers.  We must help young people by
forming positive peer groups.  Finally, there is a contingent
of adults in every neighborhood.  These adults must be brought
together to network their resources and battle the scourge of
drugs.[47]
<P>
<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>
<P>
The drug debate should be an issue in the 1996 presidential campaign.
National leaders, public and private, must help rein in insidious
cultural influences and government must increase -- not ease up
-- pressure on drug traffickers.  It must also abandon &quot;feel
good&quot; strategies and embrace drug prevention programs that
work.

<h2>SURVEY LINKS ILLEGAL DRUG<br>
USE TO POPULAR CULTURE</h2>

<p>
Adults and adolescents see popular culture as a major factor in
the recent increase of drug abuse, according to Columbia University
researchers.
<P>
The Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse (CASA) at Columbia
released a national survey on June 29, 1995 showing that 76 percent
of adolescents and 67 percent of adults blame popular culture
-- television, movies, magazines, and popular music -- for encouraging
illegal drug use.[1]
<P>
&quot;What's at stake here is America's children,&quot; says CASA
President and former HEW Secretary Joseph A. Califano, Jr.  &quot;We
know that individuals who make it from age 10 to age 20 without
using illegal drugs, without abusing alcohol, without smoking,
are virtually certain never to do so.&quot;
<P>
The Luntz Research Company, which surveyed 2,400 adults and adolescents
between May 18 and June 8, 1995, asked, &quot;What is the most
important problem facing kids today?&quot;  One-third of the adolescents
answered &quot;drugs.&quot;  A distant second with 13 percent
was &quot;crime and violence in school,&quot; which often also
involves drugs.
<P>
The poll also included the question, &quot;When do kids start
using drugs?&quot;  Nine out of ten people who use drugs begin
by age 17.  A surprising one-third begin by age 13.

<H2>LEGALIZATION OF DRUGS:<BR>
THE MYTHS AND THE FACTS</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>

<P>
Despite data which strongly supports the continuation of effective
drug abuse prevention, treatment and enforcement programs, some
prominent Americans support legalizing illicit drugs.  For example:
<P>
<LI>George Shultz, former President Reagan's Secretary of State,
says that &quot;Legalization would destroy dealer profits and
remove their incentive to get young people addicted.&quot;[1]
<P>
<LI>Nobel laureate in economics Milton Friedman says that the criminalization
of certain drugs undermines respect for the law and creates &quot;a
decadent moral climate.&quot;  He states that legalizing drugs
like marijuana and cocaine would &quot;thus strike a double blow;
reduce crime activity directly, and at the same time increase
the efficacy of law enforcement and crime prevention.&quot;[2]
<P>
<LI>U.S. Federal District Judge Robert Sweet says the nation should
learn the lesson of prohibition and the crime that ensued when
alcohol was illegal.  &quot;Look at tobacco, the most addictive
drug, and we've reduced [use] by a third.&quot;[3]
<P>
<LI>Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke commented on former Surgeon General
Joycelyn Elders' call for a study to legalize drugs.  &quot;I
think what the Surgeon General said was absolutely courageous
and correct.&quot;[4]
<P>
<LI>Aryeh Neier, president of billionaire philanthropist George
Soros's Open Society Institute, states, &quot;The current [drug]
policy is wasteful and it promotes crime and disease....  From
every standpoint, it is a failure.&quot;[5]
<P>
Many other officials disagree.
<P>
Lee P. Brown, the director of the Office of National Drug Control
Policy at the White House, labels legalization &quot;a formula
for self-destruction&quot;[6] and warns that decriminalization of
drugs would mean genocide for the black community.[7]
<P>
Wayne Roques, a much-published Drug Enforcement Agency spokesman,
says, &quot;Drug policies which legalize drugs would decimate
the inner cities and gravely wound the suburban populations....
 Legalization is a morally and intellectually bankrupt concept.&quot;[8]
<P>
Most Americans want to know the truth about drugs and expect public
policy to be based on facts and not myths.  Yet myths about legalization
abound.  Consider:
<P>
<CENTER><H3>MYTH #1: ILLICIT DRUGS ARE NO WORSE THAN LEGAL<BR>
DRUGS LIKE ALCOHOL AND TOBACCO.</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Marianne Apostolides of the pro-legalization Lindesmith Center
wrote in the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>, &quot;Marijuana is safer
than other substances such as nicotine and steroids.  Most people
who use marijuana have no problem with it.&quot;[9]
<P>
Yale law professor Steven B. Duke, who wrote <I>America's Longest
War: Rethinking Our Tragic Crusade Against Drugs</I>, believes,
&quot;Our biggest, worst drug problem is the tobacco problem.
 Legalizing drugs will reduce the use of alcohol, which is far
more damaging than any popular illegal drug.&quot;[10]
<P>
The fact that some dangerous substances are legal does not mean
that all dangerous substances should also be legal -- especially
when there are significant differences between the substances
in question.  Clearly, alcohol and tobacco can be quite harmful.
 They have a major impact on morbidity and mortality in the United
States.  
<P>
<LI>Alcohol is a cause or contributing factor in most traffic deaths
and nearly half of all murders, sexual assaults, robberies and
other violent crimes.  More than 40,000 babies are born at risk
each year because their mothers drank alcohol during pregnancy.[11]
<P>
<LI>Similarly, tobacco kills over 400,000 people each year in the
United States, and the British medical journal, <I>Lancet</I>,
estimates that tobacco is the cause of death for 20 percent of
the people in the developed world.[12]
<P>
<LI>Nevertheless, a given dose of cocaine or crack is far more dangerous
than a drink of alcohol.  Alcohol has an addiction rate of 10
percent, whereas cocaine has an addiction rate as high as 75 percent.[13]
<P>
And when cocaine is combined with marijuana, it can be deadly.
 According to a study in <I>Pharmacology, Biochemistry and Behavior,</I>
an increase in heart rate due to cocaine was markedly enhanced
if preceded by smoking marijuana.[14] The dual use creates greater
risk of overdose and more severe cardiovascular effects from the
cocaine.  An article in <I>Schizophrenia Research</I> found that
up to 60 percent of schizophrenic patients used non-prescription
psychoactive drugs.[15]
<P>
By itself, marijuana is a dangerous drug as well.  A joint of
marijuana is far more carcinogenic than a cigarette.  Microbiologist
Tom Klein of the University of South Florida reports, &quot;We've
tried working with [marijuana smoke], and it's so toxic, you just
get it near the immune system and it [the immune system] dies.&quot;
 Klein found that THC [tetrahydrocannabinol -- the active ingredient
in marijuana] suppresses some immune system responses and enhances
others.[16]
<P>
A study in the <I>Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology</I>
found that marijuana smoke is often contaminated by the fungus,
aspergillus.[17]  Another study in the <I>Journal of the American
Medical Association</I> found that cases of allergic sinus infection
with the same fungus came from recreational use of contaminated
marijuana.[18]
<P>
A study in <I>Drug and Alcohol Dependence</I> found that cannabis
[marijuana] users react very slowly in performing motor tasks
and suffer disability in personal, social and vocational areas.
 They also indicate a higher score for neurotic and psychotic
behavior.[19]
<P>
A study in <I>American Review of Respiratory Diseases</I> found
that marijuana smoke is as irritating as tobacco smoke; when used
together, marijuana and tobacco cause the small oxygen-exchanging
parts of the lung to shed cells that first become inflamed.[20]
<P>
A 1995 study in <I>The New England Journal of Medicine</I> suggests
that illicit drugs such as marijuana and cocaine can interfere
with male sperm production.[21] 
<P>
A study in <I>Cancer</I> found that the children of women who
smoke marijuana are 11 times more likely to contract leukemia.[22]
 Mothers who smoke marijuana also contribute to low birth weight
and developmental problems for their children and increase the
risk of abnormalities similar to those caused by fetal alcohol
syndrome by as much as 500 percent.[23]
<P>
Kasi Sridhar, a professor at the University of Miami's Sylvester
Comprehensive Cancer Research Center, reports finding large numbers
of marijuana smokers among younger cancer patients.  While only
17 percent of the patients in his study were marijuana smokers,
two-thirds of the patients younger than 45 smoked cannabis.[24]
<P>
Since the 1970s there have been more than 10,500 scientific studies
which demonstrate the adverse consequences of marijuana use.[25]
Many of these studies draw upon data collected when most of the
marijuana available in the U.S. was far less potent than that
available today.  Indeed, drug czar Lee Brown says that marijuana
on the streets today is up to 10 times more potent than a generation
ago.  This fact contributes to its addictive nature.[26]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>MYTH #2: LEGALIZATION WILL DRIVE THE CRIME RATE DOWN.</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Syndicated columnist Abigail Van Buren endorses <I>Legalization</I>.
 She wrote in her column, &quot;Dear Abby,&quot; that, &quot;The
legalization of drugs would put drug dealers out of business.&quot;
She added that it would also reduce the prison population and
create a perpetual source of tax revenue.[27]
<P>
Former Surgeon General Elders told a National Press Club luncheon,
&quot;Sixty percent of violent crimes are drug- or alcohol-related....
 Many times they're robbing, stealing and all of these things
to get money to buy drugs....  I do feel that we would markedly
reduce our crime rate if drugs were legalized.&quot;[28]
<P>
Professor Steven Duke told an America Online computer network
audience, &quot;Without a doubt, the problem of violent crime
would be ameliorated [by legalizing drugs].  I think drug prohibition
causes half of our serious crime.&quot;[29]
<P>
Rep. Barney Frank (D-Ma.) supports legalization.  &quot;We make
a mistake, with the serious law enforcement problems we have today,
to get the police to arrest people who smoke marijuana....  We
are wasting $10 billion a year trying to physically interdict
drugs.&quot;[30]
<P>
The new president of the American Bar Association, George Bushnell,
favors legalizing marijuana and cocaine.  He believes legalization
will cut crime.[31]
<P>
Legalizers believe most black market and organized syndicate involvement
in the drug business would die and that drug-induced crime would
decrease with drug legalization.  But these assertions are not
supported by the facts.
<P>
The United States experimented with legalization and it failed.
 From 1919 to 1922, government-sponsored clinics handed out free
drugs to addicts in hopes of controlling their behavior.  The
effort failed.  Society's revulsion against drugs, combined with
enforcement,  successfully eradicated the menace at that time.[32]
<P>
California decriminalized marijuana in 1976, and, within the first
six months, arrests for driving under the influence of drugs rose
46 percent for adults and 71.4 percent for juveniles.[33] Decriminalizing
marijuana in Alaska and Oregon in the 1970s resulted in the doubling
of use.[34]
<P>
Patrick Murphy, a court-appointed lawyer for 31,000 abused and
neglected children in Chicago, says that more than 80 percent
of the cases of physical and sexual abuse of children now involve
drugs.  There is no evidence that legalizing drugs will reduce
these crimes, and there is evidence that suggests it would worsen
the problem.[35]
<P>
Legalization would decrease drug distribution crime because most
of those activities would become lawful.  But would legalization
necessarily reduce other drug-related crime like robbery, rape,
and assault?  Presumably legalization would reduce the cost of
drugs and thus addicts might commit fewer crimes to pay for their
habits.  But less expensive drugs might also feed their habit
better, and more drugs means more side effects like paranoia,
irritability and violence.  Suggestions that crime can somehow
be eliminated by redefining it are spurious.
<P>
Free drugs or legalizing bad drugs would not make criminal addicts
into productive citizens.  Dr. Mitchell S. Rosenthal, expert on
drugs and adolescents and president of Phoenix House, a resident
treatment center in New York, said, &quot;If you give somebody
free drugs you don't turn him into a responsible employee, husband,
or father.&quot;[36]
<P>
The Justice Department reports that most inmates (77.4 percent
male and 83.6 percent female) have a drug history and the majority
were under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of their
current offense.  And a surprisingly large number of convicted
felons admit their crime motive was to get money for drugs.  For
example, 12 percent of all violent offenses and 24.4 percent of
all property offenses were drug-money motivated.[37]
<P>
Even if drugs were legalized some restrictions still would be
necessary.  For example, restricting the sale of legalized drugs
to minors, pregnant women, police, military, pilots and prisoners
would be necessary but would still provide a black market niche.
<P>
Pro-legalizers contend that government could tax drugs, thus off-setting
the social costs of abuse.  But history proves that efforts to
tax imported drugs like opium created a black market.  Earlier
this century Chinese syndicates smuggled legal opium into this
country to avoid tariffs.  Even today, there is ample crime based
on the legal drugs, alcohol, and tobacco.  For example, organized
crime smuggles cigarettes from states with low tobacco taxes into
those with high taxes, and such activities are accompanied by
violence against legal suppliers.[38]
<P>
If now-illegal drugs were decriminalized, the government would
have to determine the allowable potency for commercial drugs.
 But no government can okay toxic substances, so a black market
would be created for higher potency drugs and those that remained
banned, like the new &quot;designer drugs.&quot;
<P>
Even pro-drug forces do not call for blanket legalization of drugs
like LSD, crack, or PCP.  Therefore, we would continue to have
drug-related crime and illegal drug distribution organizations
that would push these drugs on youngsters, who would be more easily
induced into drug abuse through the availability and social sanctioning
of marijuana.
<P>
Drug abuse is closely correlated with crime.  The National Youth
Survey found that 25 percent of youths who admitted to cocaine
or heroin use also committed 40 percent of all the index crimes
reported.  The survey also found that youths who tested positive
for cannabinoids have more than twice as many non-drug-related
felony referrals to juvenile court as compared with those found
to have tested negative.[39]
<P>
The extent to which individuals commit &quot;drug-related crimes
only&quot; is overstated.  Most incarcerated &quot;drug&quot;
offenders violated other laws as well.  Princeton University professor
John Dilulio found that only 2 percent -- i.e., 700 -- of those
in federal prisons were convicted of pure drug possession.  They
generally committed other and violent crimes to earn a sentence.[40]
 However, 70 percent of current inmates were on illegal drugs
when arrested and, if drugs become cheaper, violent crime could
reasonably be expected to increase.[41]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>MYTH #3: LEGALIZATION MAKES ECONOMIC SENSE.</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke believes drugs can be a revenue source
for the government.  &quot;Remove the profit motive, and you put
the dealers out of business... have government stores and buy
marijuana cigarettes... nicely wrapped, purity and potency guaranteed
with a tax stamp.&quot;[42]
<P>
Ethan Nadelmann, a former Princeton University professor and now
director of the Lindesmith Center, states: &quot;Make sure that
junkies have access to clean needles; make it easy for addicts
to obtain methadone; give heroin-maintenance programs a chance
to work; decriminalize marijuana; stop spending billions on incarcerating
drug users and drug dealers.  We know we can reduce drug abuse
more effectively by spending that money on education, pre- and
post-natal care and job-training programs.&quot;[43]
<P>
Nadelmann told the <I>Rolling Stone</I> audience, &quot;...The
Pentagon's interdiction efforts, which cost U.S. taxpayers close
to $1 billion... had no impact on the flow of drugs....  [The]
drug war has been most efficient at filling up the country's prisons
and jails.&quot;[44]
<P>
Dr. Robert Dupont, founding director of the National Institute
on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and president of the Institute for Behavior
and Health in Rockville, Maryland, refutes the economic myth.
 &quot;We now have two legal drugs, alcohol and tobacco.  We have
113 million current users of alcohol and 60 million tobacco users.
 The reason marijuana and cocaine use is so much lower is because
they are illegal drugs.  Cocaine and marijuana are more attractive
than alcohol and tobacco.  If we remove the prohibition of illegality
we would have a number of users of marijuana and cocaine similar
to that of tobacco and alcohol.&quot;[45]
<P>
Health costs associated with legalization would be very high.
 And legalization would have consequences elsewhere.  For example,
the Drug Enforcement Administration says legalization of drugs
will cost society between $140-210 billion a year in lost productivity
and job-related accidents.  And insurance companies would pass
on accident expenses to consumers.[46]   
<P>
The Institute for Health Policy at Brandeis University found that
in 1990 dollars the societal cost of substance abuse is in excess
of $238 billion, of which $67 billion is for illicit drugs.  The
report states, &quot;As the number one health problem in the country,
substance abuse places a major burden on the nation's health care
system and contributes to the high cost of health care.  In fact,
substance abuse -- the problematic use of alcohol, illicit drugs
and tobacco -- places an enormous burden on American society as
a whole.&quot;[47]
<P>
The claim that legalization provides an opportunity to tax new
products is misleading.  For example, total tax revenue from the
sale of alcohol is $13.1 billion a year, but alcohol extracts
over $100 billion a year in social costs such as health care and
lost productivity.[48] There is no evidence to demonstrate that taxing
cocaine, heroin, and marijuana would bolster revenues any more
than do alcohol and tobacco, nor would the revenue from such taxation
offset the social and medical costs these illicit drugs would
impose.
<P>
The pro-drug lobby argues that legalization will save on enforcement
costs.  But elimination of drug enforcement would provide little
funding for other uses.  The government now spends 3.3 percent
of its budget on the criminal justice system and half of that
goes to enforcement.  Less than 12 percent of law enforcement
money goes to drug law enforcement.[49] 
<P>
Former Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare Joseph Califano
cautions that in a post-legalization world, &quot;Madison Avenue
hucksters would make it as attractive to do a few lines [of cocaine]
as to down a few beers.&quot;[50] This would line the pockets of
legal drug producers, but it will clearly hurt the American taxpayer
and American families.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>MYTH #4: CRIMINALIZATION OF DRUGS IS LIKE ALCOHOL PROHIBITION.</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Conservative columnist William F. Buckley, Jr., writes that the
&quot;...New York Bar in 1986 advocated the repeal of all federal
legislation dealing with drugs, leaving it to the states to write
their own policies.  This will remind you of the 21st Amendment:
when prohibition was repealed in 1933, each state was left free
to write its own liquor laws.&quot;[51]
<P>
Lindesmith Institute director Nadelmann argues that &quot;Prohibition...
financed the rise of organized crime and failed miserably as social
policy.  Likewise, the war on drugs has created new, well-financed,
and violent criminal conspiracies and failed to achieve any of
its goals.&quot;[52]
<P>
Prohibition was a solitary effort by this country while the rest
of the world was essentially &quot;wet.&quot;  However, most drugs
are illegal throughout much of the world.  This makes enforcement
much easier.
<P>
History shows that prohibition curbed alcohol abuse.  Alcohol
use declined by 30 to 50 percent; deaths from cirrhosis of the
liver fell from 29.5 per 100,000 in 1911 to 10.7 in 1929; and
admissions to state mental hospitals for alcohol psychosis fell
from 10.1 per 100,000 in 1919 to 4.7 in 1928.[53] Mark Moore, Harvard
professor of criminal justice, wrote: &quot;The real lesson of
prohibition is that society can, indeed, make a dent in the consumption
of drugs through laws.&quot;[54]
<P>
The DEA found that during prohibition, suicide rates decreased
50 percent.  The incidence of alcohol-related arrests also declined
50 percent.[55]
<P>
Yale history professor David F. Musto comments on the myth that
prohibition is a good parallel for illicit drug legalization:
&quot;Unless drugs were legal for everyone, including children...
illicit sale of drugs would continue.  Legalization would create
more drug-addicted babies, not to mention drug-impaired drivers.&quot;[56]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>MYTH #5: OTHER NATIONS HAVE SUCCESSFULLY LEGALIZED DRUGS.</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Mr. Nadelmann points to foreign nations when he writes, &quot;We
can learn much from Europe and Australia, where governments have
turned their backs on the 'war on drugs.'  They began by accepting
the obvious:  that it is both futile and dangerous to try to create
a drug-free society.&quot;[57]
<P>
Dr. John Marks of Liverpool, England promotes Great Britain's
&quot;enlightened&quot; drug programs.  &quot;The results are
zero drug-related deaths, zero HIV infection among injecting drug
takers, a... reduction of... 96 percent [in] acquisitive crime.
 And perhaps most puzzling of all, a fall in the incidence of
addiction, among the public at large of... 92 percent.&quot;[58]
<P>
History provides evidence that legalization of drugs in foreign
nations has not been successful.  For example, opium was legalized
in China earlier this century.  That decision resulted in 90 million
addicts and it took a half-century to repair the damage.[59]
<P>
Egypt allowed unrestricted trade of cocaine and heroin in the
1920s.  An epidemic of addiction resulted.  Even in Iran and Thailand,
countries where drugs are readily available, the prevalence of
addiction continues to soar.[60]
<P>
Modern-day Netherlands is often cited as a country which has successfully
legalized drugs.  Marijuana is sold over the counter and police
seldom arrest cocaine and heroin users.  But official tolerance
has led to significant increases in addiction.  
<P>
Amsterdam's officials blame the significant rise in crime on the
liberal drug policy.  The city's 7,000 addicts are blamed for
80 percent of all property crime and Amsterdam's rate of burglary
is now twice that of Newark, New Jersey.[61] Drug problems have forced
the city to increase the size of the police force and the city
fathers are now rethinking the drug policy.[62]
<P>
Dr. K. F. Gunning, president of the Dutch National Committee on
Drug Prevention, cites some revealing statistics about drug abuse
and crime.  Cannabis use among students increased 250 percent
from 1984 to 1992.  During the same period, shootings rose 40
percent, car thefts increased 62 percent, and hold-ups rose 69
percent.[63]
<P>
Sweden legalized doctor prescriptions of amphetamines in 1965.
 During the first year of legalization, the number of intravenous
&quot;speed&quot; addicts rose 88.5 percent.  A study of men arrested
during the legalization period showed a high correlation between
intravenous use and a variety of crimes.[64]
<P>
Dr. Nils Bejorot, director of the Swedish Carnegie Institute and
professor of social medicine at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm,
believes the solution to the growing drug problem is consistent
social and legal harassment of both users and dealers.[65]
<P>
Great Britain experimented with controlled distribution of heroin
between 1959 and 1968.  According to the <I>British Medical Journal</I>,
the number of heroin addicts doubled every sixteen months and
the increase in addicts was accompanied by an increase in criminal
activity as well.[66] And British authorities found that heroin addicts
have a very good chance of dying prematurely.  On the crime front,
Scotland Yard had to increase its narcotics squad 100 percent
to combat the crime caused by the &quot;legal&quot; addicts.[67]
<P>
The Swiss opened a &quot;legalized drug&quot; area in Zurich seven
years ago and local addicts were given drugs, clean needles, and
emergency medical care.  Unfortunately, the liberal policy backfired
and the number of addicts surged to 3,500; violence surged, too.
 &quot;Needle Park,&quot; as it came to be known, was a place
of open warfare among rival gangs, and even police faced gunfire.
Their cars were attacked and overturned.  In February 1995, officials
ended the experiment, conceding that it had evolved into a grotesque
spectacle.[68]
<P>
In April 1994, the mayors of 21 major European cities formed a
group called &quot;European Cities Against Drugs,&quot; an acknowledgement
that legalization had failed.[69]
<P>
There are some countries, especially in the Middle East, which
extract a high price for drug trafficking.  These countries enjoy
relative freedom from the plague of drug abuse and crime associated
with illicit sales.  This is never mentioned by <I>Legalization</I> proponents.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>MYTH #6: LEGALIZATION WOULD LEAD TO HEALTH BENEFITS.</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Nadelmann states, &quot;We should immediately decriminalize the
sale and possession of small amounts of marijuana and make it
easily available by prescription to those suffering from cancer,
AIDS, multiple sclerosis and other diseases.&quot;[70] He tells <I>Rolling
Stone</I> readers, &quot;DEA's own administrative law judge Francis
Young declared in 1988, marijuana is possibly Uone of the safest
therapeutically active substances known to man.&quot;[71]
<P>
Arnold S. Trebach, former president of the Drug Policy Foundation,
calls for the medical use of certain illegal drugs.  He claims
there is &quot;no scientific or ethical reason why government
denies heroin and marijuana to people suffering from cancer, glaucoma,
multiple sclerosis, and other diseases.&quot;[72]
<P>
In January 1994 the Clinton Administration decided to review the
federal ban against the use of marijuana for medical purposes.
 Allen St. Pierre, deputy director of the National Organization
for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML), commented on the review
decision: &quot;It's encouraging to see that the public health
service is going to get information about the efficacy of marijuana
as a therapeutic agent....  If marijuana can never be made available
to people suffering pain or going blind, it's never going to be
legalized more generally.&quot;[73]
<P>
Legalization advocates cite cases like that of James Burton, who
has glaucoma.  Drug agents seized his home for growing marijuana,
and he now lives in the Netherlands where &quot;I can buy or grow
marijuana here legally, and if I don't have the marijuana, I'll
go blind.&quot;[74]
<P>
Burton has a rare form of low-tension glaucoma.  At Burton's trial,
ophthalmologist Dr. John Merritt testified that Burton needed
marijuana to keep him from going blind.[75] 
<P>
Others claim that marijuana can be used to treat the side-effects
of chemotherapy such as nausea and vomiting and the &quot;wasting&quot;
phenomenon associated with AIDS.
<P>
There is substantial and contradictory evidence indicating that
illicit drugs should not be legalized for medical purposes.  Most
advocates for medical use of illicit drugs only address marijuana.
 Consider the evidence:
<P>
<LI>Philip Lee, Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services,
announced in July 1994, &quot;The scientific evidence doesn't
support using marijuana to treat glaucoma or nausea caused by
AIDS or cancer treatment.&quot;  Harvard medical school professor
Lester Grinspoon has challenged Lee's decision.  Grinspoon said
there is only anecdotal evidence that marijuana smoking is beneficial
because &quot;the government has prevented the scientific studies
for years.&quot;[76]
<P>
<LI>The DEA reports that marijuana is not accepted as medicine by
a single American health association.[77]
<P>
<LI>Dr. David Ettinger, professor of oncology at the Johns Hopkins
University School of Medicine, states, &quot;There is no indication
that marijuana is effective in treating nausea and vomiting resulting
from radiation treatment or other causes.&quot;[78]
<P>
<LI>A research review published in the <I>Annals of Pharmacotherapy</I>
found no scientific studies that confirmed the benefit of the
use of crude marijuana on HIV-wasting syndrome.  The use of marijuana
might actually be counter-productive because it poses a needless
and serious endangerment to the already compromised immune systems
of AIDS patients.[79]
<P>
<LI>Two studies in a 1991 book entitled <I>Drugs of Abuse: Immunity
and Immunodeficiency</I> found that the active ingredient in marijuana,
THC, suppresses or interferes with the function of white blood
cells, which fight bacterial infection.[80] Any reduction in the
fighting power of white blood cells could accelerate an HIV-positive
patient's transition to AIDS.  Additionally, marijuana increases
the health risk to AIDS patients because the smoke causes pulmonary
problems.
<P>
<LI>Glaucoma studies found that THC can decrease intraocular pressure.
 However, in order to ingest sufficient THC, the patient would
have to be stoned all day.  Alcohol also decreases intraocular
pressure.  According to Dr. Keith Green, who has served on the
boards of eight eye journals, &quot;Marijuana... has little potential
future as a glaucoma medication.&quot;[81]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>MYTH #7: LEGALIZE TO REDUCE ADDICTION RATES.</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Mayor Schmoke told the 1993 Drug Policy Foundation conference,
&quot;The United States' war on drugs and similar campaigns in
other countries have failed.  Only a harm reduction policy, led
by public health experts and emphasizing treatment, can be expected
to reduce addiction.&quot;[82]
<P>
Previous efforts to legalize drugs like marijuana saw an increase
in abuse.  The National Families in Action found that during the
decade when 11 states decriminalized marijuana, regular use tripled
among adolescents, doubled among young adults, and quadrupled
among older adults.[83] 
<P>
Today, there are more than 8,000 emergency room visits for marijuana
abuse each year, and 77,000 persons each year are admitted to
treatment programs for marijuana abuse.[84]
<P>
It is alleged that the problem may be worse today because marijuana
is more addictive.  The pro-legalization Lindesmith Institute
challenged this in a recent <I>Wall Street Journal</I> letter.
 &quot;The myth that marijuana is three times as potent [and therefore
more addictive] as it was in the 1970s is based on a statistically
invalid comparison.  The potency of today's marijuana is measured
by a large and diverse number of confiscated marijuana samples.
 The potency of 1970s marijuana was measured by a small and unrepresentative
number of DEA-seized samples.&quot;[85]
<P>
But the DEA cites tests of THC content.  For example, the marijuana
seized at Woodstock '69 had 1 percent THC; in 1974 the average
THC was 3.6 percent; in 1984 it was 4.4 percent; and samples analyzed
in 1992 were 29.86 percent.  Based on these findings, DEA claims
that marijuana may be between 30 and 60 times as potent as were
the joints in the 1960s.[86]
<P>
ONDCP director Lee Brown confirms the addictive nature of marijuana.
 &quot;The public may have grown more blasJ about marijuana over
the years; the marijuana on the streets today is up to 10 times
more potent than that available to teenagers a generation ago.&quot;[87]
<P>
Cocaine is, of course, more addictive than marijuana.  President
William Howard Taft identified cocaine as &quot;[M]ore appalling
in its effects than any other habit-forming drug in the United
States.&quot;  He wanted it banned back in 1910.  And the ranks
of cocaine addicts grew before the substance was outlawed in 1915.[88]
<P>
During the late 1960s, Dr. Marie Nyswander experimented with opiate
addicts at the Rockefeller University, giving them free morphine,
and saw the addicts' daily tolerance for morphine rise swiftly.
 Her partner, Dr. Vincent Dole, commented, &quot;The doses on
which you could keep them comfortable kept going up and up; the
addicts were never really satisfied or happy.  It was not an encouraging
experience.&quot;[89]
<P>
Nyswander noted, &quot;Most drug abusers simply want to get high.
 Because the body daily develops more tolerance for abused drugs,
addicts must use escalating dosages to achieve euphoria.&quot;[90]
<P>
The DEA says that up to 75 percent of crack cocaine users could
become addicts.  And Mitchell Rosenthal believes that cheap and
legal cocaine would increase addiction.  He explains that &quot;given
unlimited access to cocaine, lab animals will consume increasingly
greater amounts until they die....  [He points out that] in the
U.S. there are between 650,000 and 2.4 million cocaine addicts.&quot;[91]
<P>
Dr. Mark Gold, formerly the research director at Fair Oaks Hospital
in Summit, New Jersey, now a professor at the University of Florida
medical school and a recognized expert on cocaine, states, &quot;Whereas
one out of ten alcohol users become alcoholics, one out of four
users of cocaine become addicted.  If, for example, cocaine becomes
legalized and use rose from 6 million to 60 million, this would
mean we would have 15 million addicts in need of treatment, without
prospects for a complete cure, constantly relapsing.&quot;[92]
<P>
Dr. Herbert Kleber of Columbia University suggests that legalizing
cocaine would increase use up to sixfold.  And Joseph A. Califano,
founding president of the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse
at Columbia University, notes that any &quot;stamp of legality&quot;
on cocaine would lead to big increases in the number of addicts
and &quot;light a new flame beneath health care spending.&quot;[93]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>MYTH #8: LEGALIZATION IS A CIVIL LIBERTIES ISSUE.</H3></CENTER>
<P>
NORML's Allen St. Pierre states, &quot;If you took the illegality
out, pot wouldn't mean anything to rappers....  [B]ut it's an
injustice they can sing about.&quot;[94]
<P>
Chicago commodities trader Richard Dennis has contributed more
than $1 million to the pro-legalization Drug Policy Foundation.
 He opposes criminal penalties for drug use and states, &quot;It's
a self-evident proposition that people shouldn't go to jail for
things they do to themselves.&quot;[95]
<P>
To legalize behavior is in large measure to condone it.  DEA agent
Wayne Roques visits many high schools in Florida to discuss illicit
drugs.  At every session at least one student defends use of illicit
drugs explaining, &quot;Surgeon General Elders supports legalization.
 So drugs must be okay.&quot;[96]
<P>
Illicit drug use is not a victimless crime because the user, his
family, and society suffer social and economic costs.  For example,
drug use by pregnant mothers causes in utero damage to the child.
 It increases the risk of mortality threefold and the risk of
low birthweight fourfold.  Drug abuse is a key factor in most
child abuse cases.  In Philadelphia, cocaine is implicated in
half of the cases in which parents beat their children to death,
and in 80 percent of all abuse cases.[97]
<P>
In the nation's capital, 90 percent of reported child abusers
are also illicit drug abusers.  In nearby Maryland, one-third
of all car accidents involve drivers who test positive for marijuana.
 And a few years ago, a Conrail disaster took the lives of 16
and hurt another 175, because the train conductors were intoxicated
with illegal drugs.[98] If those drugs were legal, the result would
have been no less lethal to the innocent victims.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CONCLUSION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
There is no &quot;civil right&quot; to do what is wrong or harmful
to yourself, your family, or your society.  
<P>
The facts show that legalization is a mistake for America because:
<P>
<LI>Illegal drugs are more addictive and dangerous than the legal
drugs alcohol and tobacco, which is verified by thousands of scientific
studies.  
<P>
<LI>Legalization would result in more crime such as driving while
intoxicated; child abuse, including child pornography; random
violent crime; and a prosperous black market.
<P>
<LI>Legalization has no economic justification.  Taxing illicit
drugs would offset only a small fraction of the social costs.
<P>
<LI>Banning illicit drugs is not like alcohol &quot;Prohibition.&quot;
 Drug laws reduce abuse and the medical costs associated with
abuse.  Legalization would do the opposite.
<P>
<LI>Other nations have learned that liberalizing drug policies only
leads to more addicts and unacceptable social consequences.  
<P>
<LI>Illicit drugs offer no offsetting health benefits.  Rather,
marijuana damages most major body systems and provides minimal
help for glaucoma victims and only when they are constantly stoned.
<P>
<LI>Cocaine is far more addictive than alcohol, and marijuana is
at least 10 times more potent today than a generation ago.

Drug abuse among teenagers has risen significantly in recent years.
 A nationwide survey by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)
in 1994 found that annual marijuana use among 8th graders rose
from 6.2 percent in 1991 to 13 percent in 1994.  The trend is
also evident among 10th (16.5 percent to 30.4 percent) and 12th
(36.7 percent to 38.2 percent) graders.  And cocaine, crack, heroin,
and LSD use among teenagers is also rising and may soon rival
the high rates of the 1970s.[1]
<P>
The NIDA found that drug-related emergency room cases increased
eight percent from 1992 to 1993.[2] Cocaine-related hospital emergency
room visits grew from 101,200 in 1991 to 119,800 in 1992; during
the same period, heroin-related emergencies soared from 35,900
to 48,000.[3]
<P>
In one study of reckless drivers who were not obviously drunk
from alcohol, 59 percent tested positive for cocaine or marijuana[4]
and thirty-five percent of all automobile accident victims in
another study had detectable levels of marijuana in their blood.[5]
<P>
The biggest rise is in marijuana abuse, possibly because it is
perceived differently from the &quot;hard&quot; drugs.  Although
some young people don't even consider marijuana a &quot;drug,&quot;
Dr. Carlton Turner, former NIDA director and head of the Marijuana
Research Project at the University of Mississippi, warns, &quot;There
is no other drug used or abused by man that has the staying power
and broad cellular actions on the body that cannabis [marijuana]
does.&quot;[6]
<P>
The short-term effects of marijuana include impairment in learning
and memory, perception, judgment and complex motor skills.  It
can cause difficulty in speaking, listening effectively, thinking,
retaining knowledge, problem-solving, and forming concepts.[7]
<P>
These effects can translate into poor job performance.  An article
in the <I>Journal of the American Medical Association</I> found
that marijuana users had &quot;55 percent more industrial accidents,
85 percent more injuries and a 78 percent increase in absenteeism.&quot;[8]
<P>
Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala states, &quot;Young
people 
must understand that there is clear scientific evidence that marijuana
is a dangerous drug that can have acute and hazardous effects.&quot;[9]
 Over 10,500 published scientific papers show that marijuana damages
brain cells, the lungs, may adversely affect reproduction in women
and fertility in men, endangers the unborn baby and newborns of
pot-smoking women, and could damage the heart.[10] 
<P>
Shalala calls for &quot;strong and comprehensive solutions....Young
people must grow up knowing unambiguously that drug use -- including
smoking marijuana -- is unwise, unhealthful, illegal and wrong.
 They must hear this from everyone in their communities -- their
parents, their teachers, their employers, their peers, the media
-- all of us.  We need anti-drug messages that are every bit as
pervasive and strong as the pop culture images that tell our youth
drugs are o.k.&quot;[11]
<P>
Dr. Lloyd Johnson, lead researcher for NIDA's 20th annual survey,
says the aggressive anti-drug messages of the 1980s have receded
into the background.  &quot;If the softening of attitudes...continues
unabated, we can expect to see continued increases in drug use
among our children.&quot;[12] 
<P>
Dr. Johnson blames the culture.  &quot;The arduously woven fabric
of attitudes, beliefs and peer norms which brought about that
decline (in the 1980s) is beginning to unravel....  Conversely,
we're seeing drug abuse, and specifically marijuana use, talked
about positively in rock and rap music, in television programming
and in other areas like fashion.&quot;[13]
<P>
The consequences of unabated illicit drug use go beyond those
already outlined.  For example, illicit drug use correlates with
crime.  The Bureau of Justice Statistics found that 32 percent
of inmates have used cocaine and half had used drugs in the month
before their offense.  Seventy-five percent reported having used
marijuana in the past.[14]
<P>
Drugs numb the conscience and lower inhibitions.  They contribute
to mood disorders and depression and low self esteem.  A high
proportion of cocaine users admit the drug makes them feel violent
at times.
<P>
Consider some recent examples of youth violence that involved
drug abuse.
<P>
<LI>Five Dodge City, Kansas teenagers, high on marijuana,
killed a stranger for no obvious reason.[15]
<P>
<LI>Three West Palm Beach, Florida teenagers mixed beer,
rum, marijuana and cocaine and then kidnapped and set ablaze a
tourist from Brooklyn.[16]
<P>
<LI>A New Scandia Township, Minnesota teen shot his mother
and stepfather to death.  He admitted to almost daily abuse of
marijuana.[17]
<P>
<LI>Two Miami, Florida teenagers were smoking marijuana
when one accidentally shot and killed the other.[18]
<P>
Social scientists confirm the relationship between drug use and
juvenile deliquency.  A 1990 study published in the <I>Journal
of Drug Issues</I> found the strongest association between the
severity of the crime and the type of substance used -- the more
intoxicating the substance, the more serious the incident.[19]
<P>
A study in <I>Today's Delinquent</I> found alcohol and marijuana
users commit twice the number of delinquent acts as non-users,
and a study in <I>Adolescence</I> found that half of all polydrug
users had engaged in delinquent acts.[20]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>THE CULTURE'S PRO-DRUG INFLUENCE</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Evidence of &quot;drug glorification&quot; in the culture is pervasive.[21]
<P>
Maureen Ketchum, executive director of the Youth Leadership Institute
in San Francisco, states, &quot;Some young people see that to
be hip, sexy, cool they have to drink, party and take drugs....Pop
culture is a factor and young people emulate what is put out there
to emulate.  The industry creates the norm and people live up
to it.&quot;[22]
<P>
Phil Salzman, director of the Gloucester [Massachusetts] Prevention
Network, which works with teenagers in school, writes, &quot;The
power of being accepted and wanting to be normal is a lot stronger
than the truth in the antidrug message....If there is a party
with beer, pot and 60 kids, the norm is determined by the majority
behavior.&quot;[23]
<P>
&quot;Woodstock '94&quot; shows that the sex-drug-rock counterculture
of the 1960s is not dead.  It was temporarily stalled in the 1980s
when the Reagan administration, activists and citizen groups mobilized
against it.  But youth drug use has not disappeared.  And glamorization
of drug use in the industry appears to be on the rise.  Consider
the evidence.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>DRUGS ARE A MAINSTAY IN ROCK AND RAP MUSIC</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML)
has counted 45 music groups that have declared their support for
legalizing marijuana.[24] Here is a profile of some of the pro-drug
groups.  
<P>
<LI>The Black Crowes often unfurl a 48 x 24 foot curtain
bearing a marijuana leaf and the words &quot;Free Us&quot; at
their shows and sell rolling paper for marijuana cigarettes on
the side.[25] They wear trousers covered with images of cannabis
leaves.  Lead singer Chris Robinson told rock magazine <I>High
Times</I>, &quot;We did 350 shows, smoked every night and never
got busted.&quot;  He explains, &quot;Pot's got nothing to be
taboo about, man.  It's part of pop culture.&quot;[26] 
<P>
<LI>Cypress Hill, a rap group, cites the history of marijuana
on the inside cover of its compact disc, &quot;Black Sunday.&quot;
 That disc includes the songs &quot;Legalize It,&quot; &quot;I
Wanna Get High,&quot; &quot;Stoned Is the Way of the Walk,&quot;
and &quot;Light Another.&quot;  Group member Sen Dog states, &quot;We
made it popular to be into the blunt,&quot; which refers to the
trendy practice of smoking a hollowed-out Philly Blunt cigar packed
with marijuana.  Their 1993 album has sold more than a million
copies and included the hit single, &quot;Insane in the Membrane.&quot;[27]
<P>
<LI>Tom Petty's double platinum album &quot;Wildflowers&quot;
includes &quot;You Don't Know How It Feels,&quot; which has the
line, &quot;But let's get to the point, let's roll another joint.&quot;
 Another song on the same album, &quot;It's Good to Be King,&quot;
includes the line, &quot;It's good to get high and never come
down.&quot;  And Petty's non-album track titled, &quot;Girl on
LSD,&quot; has the following lyrics, &quot;Through ecstasy, crystal
methane glue, I've found no drug compares to you.... I was in
love with a girl on LSD.&quot;
<P>
<LI>Green Day's album, &quot;Dookie,&quot; which has sold
more than five million copies, includes songs like &quot;Basket
Case,&quot; with the lyrics, &quot;I think I'm cracking up.  Am
I just paranoid?  I'm just stoned.&quot;  Green Day bassist Mike
Dirnt told <I>Rolling Stone</I>, &quot;I think drinking and doing
drugs are very important.... [He comments on a recent concert.]
 I was flying on acid so hard, I was laying up against the wall
with my bass lying on my lap.&quot;  Tre Cool, Green Day's drummer,
said, &quot;When people bring weed to our shows, that's wonderful.
 I'm the guinea pig.  If somebody throws a bag of weed onstage,
Billie will watch to make sure we don't get all [expletive deleted]
on it, but I dive right in.&quot;  Billie Joe Armstrong concludes,
&quot;...Tre really likes pot -- but the main thing of choice
was speed.  People think that we're this big pot-smoking band
even though we sound like an amphetamine band, but I dabbled a
lot in speed for a long time.  That was the drug of choice on
the scene I came from.&quot;  The band, originally named Sweet
Children, renamed itself in 1989 &quot;after one of its songs
about hanging out and smoking pot.&quot; [28]
<P>
<LI>Nine Inch Nails' album, &quot;The Downward Spiral,&quot;
includes &quot;My Self Destruct&quot; with the lyrics, &quot;I
am the needle in your vein and I control you, I am the high you
can't sustain and I control you.&quot;  &quot;Hurt&quot; has the
following lyric, &quot;The needle tears a hole, the old familiar
sting, try to kill it all away.&quot;  &quot;Hurt&quot; explores
drugs as a means of escape.  Lead singer, Trent Reznor, was voted
<I>Spin</I> magazine's &quot;Best Artist&quot; for 1995, and Nine
Inch Nails was voted the &quot;Best Metal Band&quot; in 1995 by
<I>Rolling Stone</I> readers.  
<P>
<LI>Time Warner distributes an album by rapper Dr. Dre
titled, &quot;The Chronic,&quot; a slang term for a potent strain
of marijuana.  The cover features marijuana leaves.  The album
peaked at number two on the Billboard charts, stayed in the top
10 for eight months, and has sold more than three million copies.
<P>
<LI>The Beastie Boys' latest album, &quot;Ill Communications,&quot;
includes a pro-pot song, &quot;Legalize the weed, and I'll say,
'Thank heavens.'&quot;  The Beastie Boys were declared &quot;Best
Rappers&quot; by <I>Spin</I> and <I>Rolling Stone</I> magazines
for 1995.
<P>
<LI>Snoop Doggy Dogg's album &quot;Doggystyle,&quot; includes
a rap, &quot;Bathtub,&quot; which states, &quot;You can smoke
a pound of bud [marijuana] every day...That's the American dream&quot;
and another, &quot;Gin and Juice,&quot; which states, &quot;Rolling
down the street smoking indo [Indonesian marijuana], sippin' on
gin and juice,&quot; and a third, &quot;Tha Shiznit,&quot; which
states, &quot;I gotta fat bud, sack full of chronic in my back
pocket...Need myself a lighter so I can take a smoke.  I smoke
every day.&quot;  Snoop Doggy Dogg was arrested on December 21,
1994 in Lake Charles, LA, for possession of marijuana and drug
paraphernalia.  He was named by <I>Rolling Stone</I> as &quot;Best
Rap Group&quot; for 1995.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>DRUG MUSIC'S IMPACT</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The Parent's Music Resource Center reports that teens listen to
an estimated 10,500 hours of rock music between the seventh and
12th grades alone -- just 500 hours less than the total time they
spend in school over 12 years.  Typical estimates are that the
standard teen listens to rock music four to six hours each day.[29]
<P>
Dr. Joseph Stuessey, professor of music history at the University
of Texas, told the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee that, &quot;Music
affects behavior.  This simple fact has been known intuitively
for centuries.... In the 20th century, especially in the last
four decades, tons of research has been done on the interrelationship
of music and human behavior.... It affects our moods, our attitudes,
our emotions, and our behavior.  It affects us psychologically
and physiologically.&quot;[30]
<P>
Child and adolescent psychiatrist Dr. Robert Demski identifies
music as one of the most powerful influences on youth.[31]
<P>
Dr. Sheila Davis, a professor of lyric writing at New York University,
states that songs &quot;are more than mere mirrors of society;
they are a potent force in the shaping of it....[P]opular songs...provide
the primary `equipment for living' for America's youth.&quot;[32]
<P>
Child psychologist Dr. David Elkind writes in <I>The Hurried Child,</I>
&quot;Music can influence young people as much as any visual media.&quot;[33]
<P>
Pharmacologist Dr. Avram Goldstein of Stanford University writes
in <I>Physiological Psychology</I> that for 96 percent of the
respondents in his study, their biggest thrills came from music.[34]
<P>
Dr. Paul King, medical director of the adolescent program at Charter
Lakeside Hospital in Memphis, warns that &quot;80 percent of the
teenagers he treats have listened to heavy metal rock several
hours a day.&quot;[35]
<P>
<H3><CENTER>MTV'S TREATMENT OF ILLICIT DRUG USE</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Dennis Cooper writes in the March 1995 edition of <I>Spin</I>,
a rock music magazine, that pro-drug visual images are especially
provoking.  He explains, &quot;Just the mention of the word
'heroin' in a lyric, or a photograph of a hypodermic
on a CD cover, or the sight of junkie musicians all wrapped up
in some glamorous video, and they [recovering addicts] go crazy
with longing for the stuff.&quot;[36]
<P>
Researchers have found that the marriage between television and
music is powerful.&quot;  The video clarifies the meaning of a
song.[37] MTV's meteoric rise in popularity evidences the power.
 According to the authors of <I>Dancing in the Dark</I>, an eleven-month
study of the growing, changing, and powerful influence of music
and media on youth, music television is &quot;one of the most
powerful forms of contemporary propaganda.&quot;[38]
<P>
MTV founder Robert Pittman explains music television's impact
on youth:  &quot;We're dealing with a culture of TV babies.  They
can watch, do their homework, and listen to music all at the same
time.... At MTV we don't shoot for the fourteen year olds, we
own them.&quot;[39]
<P>
Author Donna Gaines explains, &quot;With MTV, drug use has just
taken on the status of a commodity.&quot;[40] Video director Samuel
Bayer disagrees.  He gives MTV more credit: &quot;I grew up in
the '70s, when there were drug references all over the place....
Kids are smart enough to read between the lines.  Something like
Kurt Cobain dying -- that's what happens when your life is [expletive
deleted].  If anything, videos have the opposite effect.&quot;[41]
<P>
MTV has a drug policy.  Carole Robinson, a senior vice president
at MTV, says that her network does not &quot;promote, glamorize,
or show as socially acceptable the use of illegal drugs or the
abuse of legal drugs.&quot;[42] But Cooper points out, &quot;You
don't need a degree in deconstruction to see the signs of drugginess
all over MTV, whether it's Alice in Chains' elegant little travelogues
of junkie life, or Ministry's 'Just One Fix' clip, in which heroin
withdrawal is given a snazzy, action-packed movie-trailer look,
or even Tori Amos's clip for 'God,' in which a character simulates
'tying off.'  If kids are smart enough to know what's fiction
and what's not, then they are smart enough to decode these kinds
of messages too.&quot;[43]
<P>
Cooper compares MTV's drug policy to a makeup artist's covering
of crow's-feet on an aging actress.  &quot;Pot leaves, pills,
and hypodermic needles are successfully smudged beyond recognition,
but the subtleties remain.&quot;[44]
<P>
MTV and Black Entertainment Television (BET) digitally blur images
of marijuana leaves and names in music videos, such as Dr. Dre's
&quot;Nothing but a G Thang&quot; which features men wearing baseball
caps emblazoned with marijuana leaves.[45] A former member of several
prominent alternative rock bands told Cooper, &quot;I can't even
watch MTV anymore, it's so full of junkies.  I can spot them in
an instant, and I feel like they're calling to me from this terrible
and fascinating place in my past.&quot;[46]
<P>
MTV aired a pro-drug program, &quot;Straight Dope&quot; on August
27, 1994.  Host Kurt Loder introduces the program stating, &quot;We
are going to spend the next hour taking a very close look at drugs,
what they are, what they do to people who use them, and how well
or poorly official government prohibition, the eight-year long
war on drugs, has worked.&quot;
<P>
A teen on the program says, &quot;It's not like I'm trying to
commit suicide or anything -- it's no worse than drinking coffee,
smoking a cigarette, drinking a beer, or taking a shot of tequila.&quot;
<P>
Loder portrays some drug users as rational, everyday people who
are minimally affected by the illicit substances.  The three-part
film was publicized for public school use by &quot;MTV Community
of the Future&quot; and is endorsed by the National Education
Association.  MTV offers &quot;teacher support material&quot;
to help with classroom discussions.[47]
<P>
<H3><CENTER>YOUTH PRINT MEDIA ENCOURAGE ILLICIT DRUG USE</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The May 5, 1994 edition of <I>Rolling Stone</I> is headlined,
&quot;Drugs in America:  The Phony War, the Real Crisis.&quot;
 The magazine is devoted to a pro-drug message.
<P>
The March 1995 edition of <I>Details</I>, a pop culture magazine,
includes an article about the Sativa Hemp Store in San Marcos,
Texas, which stamps dollar bills with the words &quot;I grew hemp&quot;
coming out of George Washington's mouth.  The first president
grew rope hemp at his Northern Virginia estate, Mount Vernon.
 &quot;Hemp activists say the stamp helps to draw attention to
the utility -- and former respectability -- of the plant.&quot;[48]
<P>
Drug advertisements are in many metal, rap and hip hop magazines.
 The college edition of <I>Rolling Stone</I> recently included
an invitation to join NORML which states, &quot;Every 2 minutes,
another American is arrested on marijuana charges.  You could
be next!&quot;[49] Another ad solicits for a bumpersticker, &quot;There's
no hope -- let's do dope.&quot;  <I>Rolling Stone's</I> December,
1994 Double Issue (December 29, 1994 to January 12, 1995) advertises
a &quot;Genuine Ostrich Egg&quot; with a marijuana leaf and the
words &quot;Get High Tonight&quot; emblazoned on the egg.[50] 
<P>
<I>Q</I> magazine's February 1995 edition contains an ad, &quot;Grow
Yer' Own, The Home-Gro Company, Everything You Need to Grow the
Best!!!&quot; [51] February, 1995's <I>Relix</I> advertises for &quot;Indoor
Grow Lights&quot; and adds the bold statement, &quot;We sell lights
<B>that's all we do</B> just mail order, just lights!&quot;[52]
<P>
The same edition of <I>Relix</I> includes a very sympathetic article
entitled &quot;Families Against Mandatory Minimums.&quot;[53] FAMM
president Julie Stewart's brother is serving a five-year term
for cultivation of marijuana.  She accuses the Drug Enforcement
Agency of preying on naive Grateful Dead fans.  &quot;They are
not serious professional drug dealers and so they don't expect
the person who they're selling drugs to, to be an undercover agent.&quot;[54]
 Stewart makes her case by stating, &quot;[T]he drug offenders
are actually pushing violent offenders out of prison because the
violent offenders do not have a mandatory minimum time that they
have to serve.&quot;[55]
<P>
<I>Relix</I> includes a section inviting readers to write to &quot;Incarcerated
Deadheads.&quot;[56] Although the section does not list their convictions,
a personal ad reads, &quot;Help!  In April of 1986 I was arrested
at Irvine Meadows for possession.&quot;[57]
<P>
&quot;Friday at Four&quot; is an America Online interactive computer
talk show with special guests.  It recently hosted Yale law professor
Steven Duke, who taught President Clinton and is the pro-drug
author of <I>America's Longest War: Rethinking Our Tragic Crusade
Against Drugs</I>.  
<P>
Duke responded to questions about drugs.  He said that banned
drugs should be legalized &quot;Absolutely, without a doubt, immediately!&quot;
 He favors lifting the ban on &quot;marijuana, opiates (heroin
and morphine) and cocaine, including crack.&quot;  He also promoted
needle exchanges.  He explained, &quot;I think drug prohibition
causes half of our serious crime....Our biggest problem, worst
drug problem is the tobacco problem.  Legalizing drugs will reduce
the use of alcohol, which is far more damaging than any popular
illegal drug.&quot;[58]
<P>
Even the popular &quot;Dear Abby&quot; syndicated advice column
has gone pro-drug.  Abigail Van Buren recently wrote in favor
of legalization.  She wrote, &quot;The legalization of drugs would
put drug dealers out of business.&quot;[59]
<P>
<H3><CENTER>CALLING ALL PARENTS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Government leaders and scientists recognize that curbing drug
abuse requires positive prevention programs, messages to counter
the pro-drug cultural bent, strong enforcement, and involved parents.
<P>
Joseph Podgorski, a principal of Amherst Central High School near
Buffalo, New York, faults parental naivete for teen drug abuse.
 &quot;There is certainly a lot of drinking going on, especially
on the weekends, and I'm sure there is casual drug use...The biggest
problem is trying to get kids' parents to admit that their kids
have a problem.  A lot of it is just not wanting to deal with
it.&quot;[60]
<P>
Numerous studies show that parents can make the difference for
children faced with peer and cultural pressures to take illicit
drugs.  For example, a study in the <I>Journal of Children in
Contemporary Society</I> found that childhood predictors of adolescent
substance abuse include: family history of drug abuse, family
management and discipline styles, family communication patterns,
and the child's own early use of the gateway drugs.[61]
<P>
A 1985 NIDA study of the use of illegal drugs among children states
that &quot;traditionality, family intactness, self-awareness,
monitoring, and firmness&quot; are parental traits found in the
families of drug-free children.[62]
<P>
A 1990 study in the <I>Journal of Youth and Adolescents</I> considered
peer versus parental influence for substance use.  It found that
parents are the most influential people in the teenager's life,
both for drug users (63.2 percent) and abstainers (79.1 percent).
 Abstaining teens still go to their parents first (66 percent)
when problems arise.  However, drug-using teens tend to go to
friends more often with their problems.[63]
<P>
There are conflicting studies which found that friends and peers
have replaced parents as the greatest influencers of teen values.
 And for the 1990s quite possibly the media will emerge as dominant.
 <I>Dancing in the Dark</I> warns, &quot;Youth...need the media
for guidance and nurture in a society where other social institutions,
such as the family and the school, do not shape the youth culture
as powerfully as they once did.&quot;[64]
<P>
<H3><CENTER>CONCLUSION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Lois Haight chaired a 1988 White House Conference
on a Drug-Free America.  She heard from 1,000 recovering addicts
who unanimously gave the same heartfelt message, &quot;Make it
difficult, very difficult to use [illicit drugs], because if you
don't, the lure and seductiveness of the 'high' will prevail.&quot;[65]
<P>
Youth attitudes and behaviors have changed with regard to the
threat associated with illicit drugs.  Although the culture has
increasingly embraced pro-drug messages, concerned citizens can
effectively counter these negative influences by educating themselves
to the threat and exercising their responsibility to listen and
lovingly guide children to &quot;Just Say No&quot; to drugs.

<H2>Business Relations Department</h2>

<hr>
<p>
The primary mission of the Business Relations department is to educate and mobilize the business community -- entrepreneurs, corporate leaders, trade associations, and activists -- on behalf of the  free enterprise/limited government policy agenda.  The department has coordinated briefings for industry groups on the current status of health care reform, telecommunications deregulation, trade, budget and tax reform, and deregulation.  
<p>
	In addition to meeting and briefing corporate representatives, the Business Relations department is working with industry coalitions to advance our agenda; coordinating working group meetings on the flat tax and regulatory reform; creating a "Resource Bank of Business" by identifying businessmen willing to speak, write, and testify on behalf of free enterprise/limited government policies; coordinating the activities of  our <a href="/heritage/dept_writeups/physc.html"><b>Physicians Council</b></a>; and launching a new <a href="#council"><b>Business Council</b></a> of the Heritage Foundation.
<p>
	In addition to smaller, informal briefings, we host Heritage's regular <b><i>Washington Policy Roundtable</i></b> meetings which bring Heritage experts, industry representatives, and policy makers together to discuss issues that are being debated on Capitol Hill.  <b><i>Roundtable</i></b> meetings this year have included:
<p>

</table><p>


	Business Relations also launched two new fax publications this year to update and inform the business community.  Both are targeted to representatives in the corporate, public relations, legal, and association fields.  The <i>Business Bulletin</i> presents an occasional essay on topics of special interest to this community.  The first <i>Bulletin</i> on <a href="/heritage/dept_writeups/bb596.html">"Corporate Responsibility"</a> was authored by Rebecca Lukens Fellow <a href="/heritage/staff/wilson.htm">Mark Wilson</a> and timed for release just prior to the White House conference on corporate responsibility.  The second <i>Bulletin</i> highlights the Heritage publication on "<a href="/heritage/dept_writeups/bb696.html">How the Congress Won the Budget War</a>" and offers free copies of our new pocket-sized summary card on the paper.  <a href="/heritage/dept_writeups/octbrcal.html"><i>This Month at Heritage</i></a> is a faxed monthly calendar previewing upcoming Heritage lectures and events for the business community.

<h3>Business Council</h3>
<p>
Heritage launched a Business Council, which will educate business executives, small business owners, and entrepreneurs about issues that directly affect them.  Our goal in establishing a Business Council of the Heritage Foundation is to identify a group of businessmen activists who, through their civic, business and community activities will help us leverage our own work on issues like tax and regulatory reform, health care, the federal budget, and education reform.
<p>
Members of the Council receive receive Heritage reports through the mail and by fax.  And serve as a source of information for Heritage experts on the impact government policies have on real people. 
 <p>
	If you are interested in joining the Business Council of The Heritage Foundation, please contact:  Bridgett Wagner, Director of Business Relations at 202/608-6050 or via email at <a href="mailto:wagnerb@heritage.org">wagnerb@heritage.org</a>.

<p>
<a name="flattax">
<h3>Flat Tax Transition Rules Working Group</h3>
<p>

	The Heritage Foundation and the Citizens for a Sound Economy Foundation have conducted a series of meetings that address various aspects of making a successful transition to a fundamentally reformed tax system.  These meetings will result in "white papers" and recommendations on moving towards effective transition rules. Topics have included: Accumulated Depreciation; Interest Deductibility; Health Care and Employee Benefits; Border Adjustability and Foreign Taxation; and Charitable Contributions.  If you are interested in learning more about these meetings or being added to our mailing list, please contact Bridgett Wagner at (202) 546-4400 or via e-mail at <a href="mailto:wagnerb@heritage.org">wagnerb@heritage.org</a>.

<p><a name="regs">
<h3>Regulatory Reform Working Group</h3>
<p>

	The Heritage Foundation leads the way in promoting regulatory reform by bringing together Hill Staff, lobbyists, and regulatory reform experts to address the ways in which we can make regulatory reform become a reality.  Topics include "How to Win the Environmental Debate," as well as other business, health and safety regulations.

<B><i>Helping the States be Heard in Washington</i></B>
<BR>
<BR>


	The  Project on Federalism and the States, formerly the Governors' Forum, was established in 1993 to enhance the role of the chief executives and legislators of the fifty states in the public debate on issues of national importance.  The broad purpose of the Project is to help increase the voice of the states in Washington to ensure that their interests command greater attention from officials in the federal government.
<P>
	The  Project on Federalism and the States is committed to restoring a balance between federal and state responsibilities through a reinvigoration of federalism.  The transfer of power from the states to Washington over the past decades has reached an unprecedented level, with virtually no area of public policy free from directives from Washington.  As the authority of state and local governments has declined, their ability to protect the interests of their constituents has continued to erode.  With decision-making on most major issues now firmly centered in Washington, state and local governments and their constituents are subjected to an ever-expanding list of mandates, regulations, and financial burdens which take little or no account of the differences between the states or of the wishes of their electorates.
<P>
	The  Project on Federalism and the States provides a platform in Washington for governors, state legislators, attorneys general, and other state and local officials to articulate directly to the Congress their positions on issues such as welfare reform, crime, education, and unfunded federal mandates on the states.   The Project highlights public policy innovations occurring outside Washington DC  through activities such as gubernatorial lectures, press conferences, position papers and editorials on key issues affecting the states, and extensive networking with national, state, and local media.

<h3>BUILDING A BETTER U.S. PARTNERSHIP WITH AUSTRALIA</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/oquinn.htm">Robert P. O'Quinn</a><br>
Policy Analyst<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Asian Studies Center Backgrounder No. 143<br>
October 30,  1996<br>

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Asia-Pacific region is becoming increasingly important to the United States. In 1995, U.S. two-way merchandise trade with the Asia-Pacific region rose to $503 billion, 38 percent of America's global two-way merchandise trade. Despite such economic intensity, however, Asia-Pacific trade remains susceptible to political upheaval that could endanger American security. The People's Republic of China is building a large military which could be used to enforce its territorial claims on the Spratly Islands and Taiwan. North Korea simultaneously poses the threats of military aggression and internal collapse. In Southeast Asia, Cambodia and Myanmar continue to repress their citizens.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To protect its economic and security interests in the Asia-Pacific region, America needs partners. The U.S. already has a number of defense partners in Asia; but some, like Japan, are not very good at liberalizing trade and other commercial activities in the region. Australia, however, in addition to being a military ally, could function effectively in helping to advance America's interest in liberalizing trade in Asia.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Australia became a major player in the Asia-Pacific region only recently. For most of this century, the government in Canberra purposely developed a strong Western cultural and economic identity; but its protectionist policies also brought the country to the edge of economic ruin by the 1980s. Following the Labor Party's victory in the March 1983 elections, Prime Minister Bob Hawke began to deregulate the economy and dismantle protectionist trade barriers. Over the next decade, Australia was transformed from the developed world's second most protected economy into a leading proponent of free trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum and the World Trade Organization (WTO). Under Hawke, Australia embraced the Asian market, welcomed Asian immigration, and reoriented Canberra's diplomatic and economic ties away from Europe and toward Asia and the United States. The result has been economic vitality, and newly elected Prime Minister John Howard is continuing these successful policies.

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In addition, Canberra has developed especially close relations with countries in the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN).<sup>1</sup>  As an outside superpower, the U.S. cannot easily duplicate the diplomatic, economic, and military ties that proximity and dedication have presented to Australia. By cooperating with Canberra on trade and security issues, Washington can benefit from Australia's unique relations with other Asian countries to secure vital American interests in the Asia-Pacific region.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Unfortunately, however, the U.S.-Australian relationship is not living up to its potential. While Canberra and Washington are cooperating more closely on defense matters,<sup>2</sup> the U.S. often pursues counterproductive agriculture and trade policies that cost Americans and Australians dearly. For example, President Bill Clinton's vacillating trade policy is undermining Canberra's hopes for trade liberalization at the upcoming meetings of APEC ministers in the Philippines on November 22-25 and of the WTO in Singapore on December 9-12. The U.S. should be working with, not against, Australia to make these meetings a success for free trade.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Improving relations with Australia will help the U.S. better protect its interests in the caldron of economic opportunity and geopolitical danger that is Asia. To accomplish this goal, the President should:
<p><ul>
<li><b> Ask Congress to eliminate the dairy, agriculture export subsidy, and sugar programs</b> that together cost American consumers and taxpayers more than $10 billion every year.
<p>
<li><b> Ask Congress to allow intracoastal shipping to use foreign-built, foreign-operated, or foreign-owned vessels.</b> The current Jones Act requirement that intracoastal shipping use U.S.-built, U.S.-operated, and U.S.-owned vessels adds between $3 billion to $10 billion annually to the logistics costs of American firms.
<p>
<li><b> Ask Congress for fast-track authority to negotiate trade agreements free of contentious environmental and labor standards issues.</b> Fast track is needed to bring Chile into the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), to present a substantive action plan for trade and investment liberalization in APEC, and to participate in any future round of WTO negotiations.
<p>
<li><b> Support Australia's initiative to harmonize such existing free trade agreements</b> as the North American Free Trade Agreement, Australia-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Agreement (CER), and ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) within APEC. This would enhance the prospects for expanding liberalization within APEC itself.
<p>
<li><b> Participate fully in APEC's "concerted unilateralism" process.</b> Under concerted unilateralism, each APEC member prepares its own action plan to liberalize trade and investment, with each plan then subject to peer review to help assure compliance in achieving the ultimate goal. At present, there still are too many differences among APEC members for formal trade negotiations to succeed. Concerted unilateralism allows APEC members to take small but concrete steps each year toward APEC's ultimate goal of free trade and investment by 2020. Only if members gain confidence in each other can a more formal negotiating process be successful.
<p>
<li><b> Work with Australia to complete unfinished items from the Uruguay Round of talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).</b> These include sector agreements to liberalize trade in basic telecommunications and maritime transport, and new negotiations to liberalize agricultural trade.
<p>
<li><b> Propose convening a new WTO round with the goal of achieving a global free trade and investment agreement by 2020.</b>
<p>
<li><b> Enhance American military ties to Australia by offering to sell Canberra Tomahawk long-range cruise missiles and by including Canberra in the development any future Asian missile defense network.</b>
</ul>
<p>

<b>AUSTRALIA: A RISING POWER IN ASIA</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It is easy for Americans to overlook Australia when thinking about Asian countries. Both stable and prosperous, Australia demands little attention from the crisis-dependent U.S. media. Moreover, most Americans do not really think of Australia as an Asian country. Unlike Asian countries with exotic cultures and languages, Australia and the U.S. share a common culture and language. It can be argued that Australia is more like the U.S. than any other country in the world.
</td></tr>But to overlook Australia when examining the Asia-Pacific region is a serious omission. There are four reasons for drawing this conclusion:
<p><blockquote>
<b>REASON #1: Australia is a major market for American goods and services</b>, with a large and vibrant economy. For example:
<p><ul>
<li><b> Australia's gross domestic product (GDP) in 1995 was $347.6 billion, making Australia's economy the fourth-largest in Asia and the 14th-largest in the world.</b> Despite Australia's relatively small population of 18 million, its GDP is larger than that of India, Taiwan, or any Southeast Asian country. Only China, Japan, and South Korea have larger economies.
<p>
<li><b> Australia is the world's 21st-largest trading power and America's 20th-largest trading partner.</b> Merchandise trade between Australia and the U.S. was $13.4 billion in 1995. In fact, the U.S. enjoyed a $7.5 billion merchandise trade surplus with Australia -- the largest such U.S. surplus with any of the world's trading powers.
<p>
<li><b> Australia hosts American direct investments of $24.7 billion.</b> Australia is the ninth-largest host to U.S. direct investment in the world and the second-largest in Asia, ranking only behind Japan.
<p>
<li><b> Trade and investment liberalization has expanded U.S. exports to Australia significantly in recent years.</b> U.S. merchandise exports to Australia have grown by 94 percent, from $5.5 billion in 1986 to $10.8 billion in 1995, and currently provide jobs to approximately 215,000 American workers. Under Canberra's liberal economic policy (especially its policy of privatization), U.S. direct investment in Australia has exploded by 165 percent, rising from $9.3 billion in 1986 to $24.7 billion in 1995.
</ul><p>
<b>REASON #2: Australia is a major proponent of free trade and investment.</b> For example:
<p><ul>
<li><b> Australia led the fight to include agricultural trade liberalization in the Uruguay Round Agreements.</b> In 1986, Australia organized the Cairns Group of 14 agricultural exporting countries to promote free trade in farm products.<sup>3</sup>  Under Australian leadership, the Cairns Group succeeded during the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations in winning the first multilateral agreement to liberalize trade in agricultural products. Along with Brazil, the European Union, Japan, and the U.S., Australia is widely considered to be one of the five most influential members of the World Trade Organization (WTO).
<p>
<li><b> Australia founded the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.</b> In January 1989, Prime Minister Bob Hawke proposed a meeting of government ministers from the Asia-Pacific region to establish a framework for economic cooperation. This led to the formation of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Canberra in November 1989.<sup>4</sup>  In November 1994, at Bogor, Indonesia, Australia and the other APEC member economies established the goal of "achieving free and open trade and investment" by 2010 for developed economies and by 2020 for developing economies.
<p>
<li><b> Australia and New Zealand were the first countries to outlaw antidumping procedures in a free trade agreement.</b> In 1988, Australia and New Zealand agreed to revise the original Australia-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement (CER) to make it the world's most comprehensive trade agreement. The CER removed all tariffs and quotas on trade in goods by 1990, established free trade in services, abolished antidumping procedures in bilateral trade, created a common labor market, and harmonized business and trade practices laws. As tariffs have fallen, protectionists in the U.S. and elsewhere increasingly have been employing antidumping procedures to curb imports. By abolishing antidumping procedures, the CER prevents such abuses.
<p>
<li><b> Unlike the U.S., Australia has lowered its trade barriers unilaterally.</b> In May 1988, Australia announced that tariffs on most manufactured goods would be lowered from 15 percent to 10 percent by July 1992. In March 1991, it announced that tariffs on most manufactured goods would be reduced further to 5 percent by July 1996, and that tariffs on textiles, clothing, and footwear would be reduced from 55 percent to 25 percent by July 2000.

</table>
<p>
<b>REASON #3: Australia is a strong military ally.</b> Australia is one of America's most steadfast military allies. Australian and American troops fought together in World War I, World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and the Persian Gulf War. Australia and the U.S. also are parties to a mutual defense treaty: the Australia, New Zealand, and United States Security Treaty, commonly known as ANZUS.<sup>5</sup>  Australia and Japan are among America's major military allies in the Asia-Pacific region.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Moreover, the Howard government recently has shown its willingness to enhance cooperation with the United States on defense and regional security issues. On July 26, 1996, Canberra agreed to host a new series of biennial military exercises called "Tandem Thrust."  The first war game in March 1997 will involve 17,000 U.S. Marines and 5,000 Australian troops near Shoalwater Bay in Queensland. Subsequent American military training exercises will occur in the Northern Territory of Australia. Because of this cooperation, the U.S. can shift much of its Asian battle training away from densely populated Japan and Korea to sparsely populated areas of Australia (and possibly help to defuse local political tensions over American bases in Japan and Korea as well).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Canberra and Washington also have agreed to cooperate on missile defense issues. China is modernizing its missile forces and twice in the last year has used its missiles to threaten democratic Taiwan. During a July 1996 meeting in Canberra, Australian Minister of Defense Ian McLachlan and U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry signed a new ten-year lease that will allow the U.S. to use a jointly manned intelligence facility at Pine Gap. The functions of this base will expand to include intelligence satellite downlinks now at the Nurrungar, Australia, facility, which soon will be closed. The Nurrungar facility enabled the U.S. Space Command to help Patriot missile operators defeat Iraqi Scud missiles during the Persian Gulf War, and Pine Gap could help the U.S. provide defense support that Israel can use to defeat missile threats. Such capabilities also could help Australia defend itself from missile threats.<sup>6</sup>  Australia is in an ideal position to facilitate regional missile defense cooperation, and the facilities at Pine Gap could be expanded to provide intelligence information that might help the United States verify a future arms control agreement to limit the number of missiles deployed by Asian countries.<sup>7</sup>
<p>
<b>REASON #4: Australia maintains close diplomatic ties to Asia.</b> Australia can influence economic policymakers in Asian countries in ways the U.S. cannot. Canberra originated the concept of a regional economic forum that led to the formation of APEC in 1989. It also worked closely with President Suharto of Indonesia to persuade more reluctant APEC members to agree to the 1994 Bogor Declaration, which set as APEC's objective "achieving free trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific by 2010 for developed economies and 2020 for developing economies."  Australia's successful trade liberalization encouraged the ASEAN countries to create their own ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) in January 1992 and to reduce the period for its implementation from 15 to ten years in October 1995. Canberra's cooperative attitude toward trade with Asia has increased Australian influence in Asian capitals. For example, the Howard government is working closely with ASEAN leaders to coordinate strategy in APEC and the WTO.
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>HOW AUSTRALIA TRANSFORMED ITS WORLD PRESENCE</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This remarkable new role for Australia has not occurred overnight. It is the result of a long transformation with deep roots in Australian history.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Despite Australia's proximity to Asia, for most of its history it has thought of itself as a European country. Because of this self-conception, Australian governments pursued policies known collectively as the "Australian Settlement."  Among other things, the Australian Settlement encompassed a "whites only" immigration policy, dependence on the United Kingdom for defense and markets, and a highly protected and regulated domestic economy.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Throughout most of this century, Canberra tried to promote industrial development through a system of high tariffs and subsidies to Australian manufacturers. But this protectionism caused a protracted decline in Australia's economy relative to the economies of other developed countries. In 1900, Australia had the highest per capita gross domestic product in the world. Over the next 80 years, it experienced the slowest growth in per capita GDP of all developed countries. By 1980, Australia had fallen to 14th place in per capita GDP.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

During the 1970s, Australia's defense and trade ties to Great Britain diminished. The United Kingdom's accession to the European Union in 1973 denied Australia preferential access to its historically most important export market. Meanwhile, the economic rise of Japan and the other "Asian tigers" provided Australia with vast new markets for its agricultural and mineral products. The integration of separate national economies into a single global economy made Australia's inward-looking economic policies increasingly burdensome.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Thus began a gradual backing away from the Australian Settlement policies. In 1973, Prime Minister Geoff Whitlam ended the "whites only" immigration policy. The result was significant Asian immigration, which caused Canberra slowly to begin to see itself more as an Asian country. Asian immigrants, with their cultural knowledge and language skills, have become a major asset for Australian firms doing business in Asia.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

However, the decisive break with the Australian Settlement came in March 1983. Suffocating from double-digit inflation and unemployment rates, Australian voters elected a Labor Government led by Prime Minister Bob Hawke and Treasurer Paul Keating. Contrary to what people normally expected of a Labor government, Hawke and Keating, driven by fear of an economic crisis, began to liberalize Australia's economy. Keating himself best summarized the challenges facing Australia:
<p>
<blockquote>
	We must let Australians know truthfully, honestly, earnestly, just what sort of international hole Australia is in.... If this government cannot get... a sensible economic policy, then Australia is basically done for. We will end up being just a third rate economy....  Then you are gone. You are a banana republic.<sup>8</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Hawke and Keating boldly rejected Australia's traditional policy of protectionism. The Labor government exposed Australia's domestic economy to global market forces through deregulation, privatization, and trade liberalization. The Hawke (1983-1991) and subsequent Keating (1991-1996) governments reoriented Australia's trade policies toward Asia, and Australia began to think of itself as an Asian country. Labor sought to broaden and deepen Australia's diplomatic and economic ties to China, Japan, South Korea, the countries of Southeast Asia, and the U.S.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

These policies have made Australia a major player in the Asia-Pacific economy. Japan is now Australia's largest trading partner (receiving 24.3 percent of total Australian exports in 1994-1995), followed by South Korea (7.9 percent), New Zealand (7.1 percent), and the United States (6.9 percent). Australia annually hosts 43,000 foreign students (mainly Asian) in its universities, earning more than $1 billion annually in service export income.
<p>
<b>THE LEGACY OF U.S. POLICY: NEGLECT AND ABUSE</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Despite Australia's growing importance in Asia, U.S. policy toward Australia is best described as benign neglect punctuated with occasional abuse -- even though Australia and the United States are long-standing allies with shared interests in commercial and military travel on oceans and seas, promoting access by American and Australian firms to domestic markets in Asia, and preventing the domination of Asia by a hostile power.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

However, it is undeniable that the U.S. has pursued agriculture and trade policies that have soured its relations with this emerging power. This may not have been intentional; American leaders simply did not pay adequate attention to the effects their decisions had on Australia. But the consequence has been undeniable: a missed opportunity to advance mutual economic interests in the Asia-Pacific region.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>U.S. Agriculture Policy: A Losing Proposition.</b> Over the past decade, the most serious dispute between Australia and the United States has been over agriculture policy. American and Australian farmers produce a wide range of agricultural commodities that compete with each other on world markets. Because of America's role as a large, if not dominant, producer and consumer of many farm commodities, U.S. agriculture policy profoundly affects world agricultural markets. Therefore, the level of agricultural protection and subsidies that Washington gives its farmers not only determines U.S. food production, consumption, and trade patterns, but also sets world prices for major agricultural commodities.<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
By contrast, Australian farmers receive world prices for most of their agricultural products.<sup>10</sup>  Thus, to the extent that U.S. agricultural subsidies distort world prices, Australian farmers are affected adversely by U.S. agricultural policy.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This problem was particularly serious in the 1980s when falling commodity and land prices caused agriculture subsidy costs to soar both in Australia and in the United States. Prime Minister Hawke and President Ronald Reagan chose radically different responses to this farm crisis. Hawke initiated a phaseout of Australia's agriculture price supports and subsidies. With the exception of its dairy industry subsidy (which will have been phased out completely in 2000), Australia now limits government agriculture assistance to inspection, quarantine efforts, pest control, education, and research.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

By contrast, President Reagan created new export subsidies to improve the price competitiveness of American farm exports. Through the Food Security Act of 1985, the Reagan Administration established the Export Enhancement Program and the Dairy Export Incentive Program to subsidize U.S. agricultural exports. President George Bush later expanded these programs through the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In the years since 1990, the attitude of American farmers toward federal agriculture programs has changed. Convinced in part by the successful transition of Australian farmers to subsidy-free agriculture, many American farmers have realized that they would be better off producing for the market instead of relying on government subsidy programs. When Congress began considering the reauthorization of federal agriculture programs in 1995, a revolution in American farm policy was at hand. The result was passage of the Federal Agricultural Improvement and Reform (FAIR) Act of 1996. In addition to granting wheat, feed grain, rice, and cotton farmers fixed but declining subsidies through seven-year transition contracts, the FAIR Act terminates production controls on wheat, feed grains, rice, and cotton. While the Act made progress toward a free market in agriculture, however, the dairy and sugar programs were modified only slightly, and the export subsidy programs were left intact. Thus, many subsidies remain. For example:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>The Dairy Program.</b> The U.S. government maintains high domestic prices for dairy products through a complex and interlocking system of support prices, milk marketing orders, and tariff rate quotas. This system severely restricts access to the American market by foreign competitors such as Australia.<sup>11</sup>  The dairy program costs American consumers approximately $9 billion annually through high prices for milk, butter, and cheese, and American taxpayers will pay another $1.6 billion to maintain this program over the next five years.
<p>
<li><b>The Dairy Export Incentive Program.</b> The Dairy Export Incentive Program provides subsidies to exporters of dairy products.<sup>12</sup>  In addition to the fact that it will cost taxpayers approximately $120 million over the next five years without increasing the American dairy industry's international competitiveness, the Dairy Export Incentive Program depresses world dairy prices and reduces Australian dairy exports to third country markets.
<p>
<li><b>The Export Enhancement Program.</b> The Export Enhancement Program has paid out more than $6 billion since 1986, mainly to assist wheat exports. Intended to make American grain more competitive abroad, the Export Enhancement Program is counterproductive. U.S. export subsidies depress world grain prices (to the obvious objection of Australian farmers) while raising domestic U.S. grain prices, thereby discouraging American farmers from exporting.
<p>
<li><b>The Sugar Program.</b> The U.S. government maintains a high domestic price for sugar through a system of import tariff rate quotas.<sup>13</sup>  In 1993, the U.S. General Accounting Office concluded that the sugar program hiked the domestic price of sugar to twice the world level and cost American consumers $1.4 billion a year. Higher U.S. prices caused sugar's share of the domestic sweetener market to fall from 79 percent in 1981 to 55 percent in 1994, forcing American sugar refiners to close processing facilities. Higher domestic prices also have driven American candy companies to move confectionery plants overseas to obtain cheaper sugar. At the same time, the sugar program has reduced world prices by an average of 4.8 cents per pound and caused Australia to export 89 percent less sugar to the U.S. since 1981. Thus, this program costs Australian exporters $274 million annually.
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

<b>The Jones Act: A Burden on the American Economy.</b> Another burden on both the U.S. and Australian economies is the Jones Act. Contained in Section 27 of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, this law restricts maritime commerce between points within the United States to ships that are American-built, American-operated, and American-owned. In September 1994, the U.S. International Trade Commission found that the Jones Act adds from $3 billion to $10 billion annually to the logistics costs borne by American business firms.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Jones Act also is a major irritant in relations with Australia. Canberra complains that this law prevents the sale of competitively priced Australian-made high-speed vessels to U.S. firms. On a broader scale, the Jones Act is an impediment to reaching an agreement in the WTO on liberalizing trade in maritime services. It prevents the President from opening intracoastal shipping to foreign-built, foreign-operated, or foreign-owned vessels. Because the U.S. refuses to liberalize its maritime industry in areas in which foreigners are competitive, many other countries are unwilling to liberalize their maritime industries in areas, such as logistics and port management, in which Americans are competitive. As a result, WTO negotiations on liberalizing maritime services have stalled.

<P>
<b>THE IMPACT OF U.S. PROTECTIONISM ON RELATIONS WITH AUSTRALIA</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While Australia has opened its economy, protectionist voices in the U.S. are urging Americans to shield themselves from the global economy. President Clinton's trade policy has been a series of mixed signals which have caused anxiety and confusion in Canberra. On the one hand, Clinton supported both the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1993 and the Uruguay Round Agreements in 1994. He also signed the FAIR Act in 1996 to dismantle some protectionist and trade-distorting U.S. agriculture programs. On the other hand, however, Clinton appears to have strayed from his support of free trade in a number of different areas. For example, the President has:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b> Blocked an agreement with Congress to reauthorize fast-track negotiating authority for trade agreements.</b> President Clinton let fast-track authority for negotiating new trade and investment liberalization agreements expire in 1994. Under fast-track authority, trade and investment agreements negotiated by the President are submitted to Congress for a straight up-or-down vote; Congress may not amend any portion of a proposed agreement before voting on it. For two years now, the Clinton Administration has insisted that any bill reauthorizing fast track must allow the President to negotiate on environmental and labor standards issues.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This position has caused fast track to stall in Congress. Republican leaders fear that environmental and labor rules in trade agreements could be misused to protect certain industries. Republicans in Congress therefore offered to pass a "clean" fast-track bill without the authority to negotiate on environmental and labor standards issues, but the Administration rejected this approach. Without fast-track authority, no country will enter into serious trade and investment liberalization negotiations with the U.S.<sup>14</sup>  The result: Canberra fears that the failure to pass fast track will stall progress on trade and investment liberalization in the Asia-Pacific region.
<p>
<li><b> Pushed for managed trade.</b> The Clinton Administration attempted to impose managed trade policies on Japan in the automotive parts and motor vehicles dispute of 1995 and with respect to semiconductors in 1996. This strategy alarmed Canberra. Although Tokyo and Washington ultimately reached agreements in 1995 and 1996, respectively, which avoided mandatory quotas, Clinton's approach to the conflict alienated Australia and other Asian countries. The result: American influence over the direction of trade and investment liberalization in the Asia-Pacific region has been diminished.
<p>
<li><b> Shown ambivalence toward the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.</b> Canberra is happy that President Clinton embraced Australia's APEC initiative and hosted the first APEC Leaders' Meeting near Seattle in 1993. It also is pleased that in 1994 the United States agreed to create a free trade and investment area in the Asia-Pacific by the year 2020. President Clinton and the other APEC leaders adopted a process known as concerted unilateralism to achieve the goal of a free trade and investment area in this region. Under this process, instead of negotiating a formal trade agreement like NAFTA, each member proposes its own action plan for realizing the common goal of free trade prior to the 1996 APEC meetings; each action plan is then subject to peer review to help assure that all will work toward the ultimate goal.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Nevertheless, President Clinton's actions in the last two years have caused Canberra to question America's commitment to the APEC process. First, President Clinton skipped the 1995 APEC Leaders' Meeting in Osaka, Japan, because of the budget stalemate with Congress. This decision disappointed Australia's Prime Minister at the time, Paul Keating, and raised questions among other leaders in the region. Second, the Clinton Administration has yet to offer a substantive U.S. action plan for APEC liberalization; its proposed plan is confined merely to a list of liberalization commitments previously made in the Uruguay Round Agreements. Canberra fears that the Clinton Administration's failure to offer anything new will discourage other APEC members from making substantive trade liberalization commitments.
<p>
<li><b> Failed to keep its commitment to liberalize trade in the WTO.</b> One of the Uruguay Round Agreements, the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), established a general framework for liberalizing trade in various services in 1994. It also established a timetable for reaching specific agreements covering the financial services, telecommunications, and maritime transport sectors.
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Clinton Administration backed away from its WTO commitments in 1995 and 1996. Claiming that India, Japan, Korea, and certain ASEAN countries had not made adequate offers to open their financial services markets, the Administration unexpectedly withdrew from the WTO negotiations to liberalize financial services markets on June 29, 1995, the day before the agreement was to be completed. When Australia and the European Union were unsuccessful in persuading the Clinton Administration to return to the bargaining table, they joined with other WTO members and signed a two-year interim financial services agreement excluding the United States. For the first time, a multilateral trade agreement was reached without U.S. consent. This demonstrates President Clinton's declining influence over the course of world trade liberalization.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While GATS established rules to be used in opening markets for certain telecommunications products such as electronic mail, voice mail, on-line information and data base retrieval, and electronic data interchange, Uruguay Round negotiators were unable to fashion rules covering such other basic products as long distance and international services. Therefore, the WTO continued the negotiations on trade liberalization in these basic services. Once again, claiming that offers from India and the ASEAN countries were inadequate, the Clinton Administration withdrew American support for a WTO telecommunications agreement on April 30, 1996, the day negotiations were scheduled to conclude. When Australia and the European Union failed to broker a compromise, the WTO extended its negotiating deadline to February 15, 1997.<sup>15</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Howard government interprets this failure to reach sector agreements as evidence of President Clinton's unwillingness to subordinate the special interests of certain American firms to the general benefits of trade liberalization. At the same time, Canberra feels that Clinton Administration policies are fueling deep division within the WTO by attempting to link trade with issues related to environmental and labor standards. Australia and other Asian countries see this as nothing but thinly veiled protectionism and a brake on global trade liberalization. Not only has the Clinton Administration once again alienated potential allies (as it did in APEC), but it may have forfeited America's leadership role in the upcoming December 9-12, 1996, WTO Ministerial Meeting in Singapore as well.
<p>
<b>BUILDING A STRONGER U.S.-AUSTRALIA RELATIONSHIP</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Despite Australia's growing economic and geopolitical importance in the Asia-Pacific region, President Clinton continues to ignore Canberra. His agriculture and trade policies have hurt Australia needlessly. Moreover, the Clinton Administration's opposition to renewing fast-track authority, its campaign for managed trade with Japan, and its vacillation regarding APEC and the WTO have raised doubts in the Howard government about America's commitment to free trade.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

These policies must be changed if the United States is to build a stronger relationship with Australia. Australia has changed greatly over the last decade. While maintaining its defense ties to the United States, it has developed closer diplomatic and economic ties to its neighbors in East and Southeast Asia and stands today as a leading advocate of free trade and investment. This new approach creates new avenues for cooperation between the U.S. and Australia. To facilitate this relationship and to enhance U.S. security and economic interests in Asia, there are several important steps that the Administration and Congress can take. Specifically, the President should:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Ask Congress to terminate the dairy, agriculture export subsidy, and sugar programs.</b> With passage of the FAIR Act, the U.S. began to wind down many economically irrational programs. However, the Dairy Program, Dairy Export Incentive Program, Export Enhancement Program, and Sugar Program survive largely intact. These programs raise U.S. consumer prices, cost American taxpayers billions of dollars annually, and decrease world prices for agricultural commodities. Eliminating them would remove a major impediment to improved U.S.-Australia relations and strengthen both economies.
<p>
<li><b> Ask Congress to allow intracoastal shipping to use foreign-built, foreign-operated, or foreign-owned vessels.</b> Repealing the Jones Act would help both the U.S. and Australia by allowing the use of competitively priced, Australian-made high-speed ships in U.S. waters. The result would be to lower logistics costs for American business firms and consumers.
<p>
<li><b> Ask Congress for fast-track authority to negotiate trade agreements free of contentious environmental and labor standards issues.</b> The U.S. needs fast-track authority to offer a substantive action plan for trade and investment liberalization at APEC, to harmonize NAFTA with other regional free trade agreements, and to commence a new round of WTO negotiations. The President should drop his insistence that authority to negotiate on environmental and labor standards issues must be included in any fast-track legislation. Environmental and labor standards issues may have an international dimension, but they should be addressed in separate negotiations on their own merits.
<p>
<li><b>Support Australia's initiative to harmonize existing free trade agreements within APEC.</b> At upcoming APEC meetings, Canberra will urge members to harmonize existing free trade agreements such as NAFTA, the CER, and the ASEAN Free Trade Area. The President should support this Australian initiative. Harmonizing NAFTA, CER, and AFTA is a practical step toward trade and investment liberalization in the Asia-Pacific.
<p>
<li><b>Participate fully in APEC's concerted unilateralism process.</b> There are too many differences among APEC members at present for negotiations on an APEC free trade and investment agreement to succeed. Before work can begin on a region-wide free trade zone, the APEC process must be strengthened. The strategy of concerted unilateralism allows members to take small but concrete steps each year toward APEC's ultimate goal of free trade and investment by 2020. Only if APEC members gain confidence in each other over the next few years can a more formal negotiating process be expected to succeed.
<p>
<li><b> Work with Australia to complete unfinished items from the Uruguay Round of GATT talks.</b> At the WTO Ministerial Meeting in Singapore, the President should support Canberra's proposal to complete unfinished items from the Uruguay Round. Washington must work with Canberra to reach agreements on liberalized trade in basic telecommunications and maritime transport services by 1997. They also should work together to prepare for the new negotiations on agricultural trade liberalization that are scheduled to begin in 1999.
<p>
<li><b> Propose convening a new WTO round with the goal of achieving a global free trade and investment agreement by 2020.</b> The President should exercise bold leadership and press other WTO members at Singapore to convene a new round of global trade liberalization talks by 1998. The new WTO round should subsume APEC's goal of free trade and investment by 2020 as its own. This policy could encourage APEC to accelerate the liberalization of trade and investment in Asia. It would not be the first time that trade liberalization in one set of negotiations spurred liberalization in another. In the early 1990s, for example, the creation of APEC helped bring the Uruguay Round negotiations to a successful conclusion.
<p>
<li><b> Enhance American military ties to Australia.</b> The agreement to stage military exercises in Australia will provide U.S. forces with a better location than Japan and Okinawa for training. Relocating training exercises from these highly populated areas also may reduce public opposition to critical U.S. defense bases there. A renewed lease on the Pine Gap intelligence facility will benefit U.S. strategic goals in Asia and the Middle East. In return, the U.S. should offer to sell Canberra <i>Tomahawk</i> long-range cruise missiles for Australia's new <i>Collins</i>-class submarines. The U.S. also should include Australia in the development of any future Asian missile defense network.
</ul>
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Like Rip Van Winkle, who slept through the American Revolution, an Australian who dozed off 20 years ago and suddenly woke up today would find a very different country. For many years, Australia resisted developing an Asian Pacific identity. That resistance has given way to acceptance of Australia's destiny as a country embracing Asia and immersing itself in the Asian market.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Australia's transformation benefits the United States in ways that should not be overlooked by U.S. policymakers. By opening its economy, Australia has expanded the market for American exports and investments. It also is a well-positioned ally that can help the United States promote trade and investment liberalization throughout the Asia-Pacific region.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The U.S. has an unprecedented opportunity to help itself by working more closely with Australia in the Asia-Pacific region. Washington should take the fullest possible advantage of this opportunity by making every effort to remove irritants in its bilateral relations with Canberra. Chief among these irritants are counterproductive agriculture programs and the Jones Act, which hurt not only Australia farmers and shipbuilders, but also American consumers. The U.S. and Australia also should cooperate closely to ensure the success of the upcoming APEC and WTO meetings. Finally, the U.S. should continue and strengthen its military ties to Australia to help maintain peace in the Asia-Pacific. In these ways, the U.S. can expand markets for American goods and services while reversing the dangerous perception of declining American influence in Asia.

<li>    The "Banana republic" comment was made during a radio interview with John Laws on May 14, 1986.<p>
<li>    Prior to 1996, U.S. agricultural programs were like a dike separating two bodies of water. One body is domestic prices; the other, world prices. When the U.S. increases agricultural subsidies and import barriers to maintain domestic prices at a higher level than world prices, foreign production that would have been sold in the U.S. is sold in other markets, and the larger supplies in other markets drive down world prices. But when the U.S. lowers agricultural subsidies and import barriers, American food imports increase. Thus, removing the dike simultaneously lowers domestic agricultural prices and raises world prices until they become identical.<p>
<li>    Dairy products are an exception.<p>
<li>    To maintain domestic prices of butter, cheese, and powdered milk, the federal government purchases any surplus of these products from processors at a fixed price ($10.35 per hundredweight in 1996). The federal government and the state of California use milk marketing orders that restrict the sale of fluid milk between different regions to maintain domestic milk prices. To limit foreign competition, the U.S. employs a tariff rate quota system that establishes country-by-country quotas for dairy imports. Under this system (as distinguished from a pure quota system), exporting countries may exceed their dairy import quotas, but the U.S. levies a prohibitively high tariff on dairy imports exceeding the quota.<p>
<li>    American exporters receive cash or surplus dairy products from the federal government as a bonus for exporting dairy products to targeted markets. This moves dairy products from the domestic market to targeted foreign markets such as Algeria, Brazil, Jamaica, India, Iraq, and Mexico, simultaneously raising domestic dairy prices while reducing dairy prices in targeted foreign markets.<p>
<li>    A tariff rate quota system differs from a pure quota system. It permits imports above the quota but also levies a prohibitively high tariff rate on them. Thus, imports effectively are limited to the quota amount in most circumstances. <p>
<li>    If Congress were allowed to amend trade agreements, Congress would likely accept the concessions that foreign governments made to reach a deal while voting to reject U.S. concessions. Such an outcome obviously is unacceptable to any foreign government. To encourage foreign governments to negotiate trade agreements with the United States, Congress devised the fast-track procedure to force itself to accept or reject trade agreements as a whole.<p>
<li>    The most important dispute concerns how to prevent telecommunications firms with monopolies in their home market for international services from undercutting other suppliers in competitive markets for international services. As a compromise, Australia proposed a safeguard that would allow a country to revoke a foreign firm's license to provide international services if that firm distorts the market with such cross-subsidies.<p>

<title>AID Should Release Economic Freedom Report Now - Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3>AID SHOULD RELEASE ECONOMIC FREEDOM REPORT NOW</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/johnson.htm">Bryan T. Johnson</a><br>
Policy Analyst<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 464<br>
October 16, 1996 <br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Concerned over the wastefulness of America's foreign aid program, Congress last year mandated that the Agency for International Development (AID) submit a report on the status of economic freedom in countries receiving U.S. aid. The report was due this summer. It is now October, however, and still no report. The Clinton Administration should fulfill its obligation under the law and submit AID's economic freedom report to Congress immediately.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>The Economic Freedom Report.</b> The appropriations bill for foreign operations, passed in November 1995 and signed into law by President Clinton in February 1996, requires AID to "submit to the appropriate congressional committees an annual report providing a concise overview of the prospects for economic and social growth.... For each country, the report shall discuss the laws, policies and practices of that country that most contribute to or detract from the achievement of this kind of growth."<sup>1</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Why this report has not been completed is a mystery. The reason certainly cannot be a lack of resources. With operating expenses of $465 million, 2,400 permanent employees, and some 6,000 long-term contractors and consultants, AID should have had no difficulty finding the resources to produce such a report and submit it to Congress on time.<sup>2</sup>  Nor can the reason be a lack of information on levels of economic freedom in the world. There now are three privately produced studies this subject: The Heritage Foundation's <i>Index of Economic Freedom</i>, Freedom House's <i>World Survey of Economic Freedom</i>, and the Fraser Institute's <i>Economic Freedom of the World</i>. While there are minor differences among these studies in the methodologies used to measure economic freedom, all three agree that economic freedom is essential to economic growth.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The most likely reason for AID's failure to submit its report is the low priority the foreign aid bureaucracy gives to economic freedom. For example, of the $12 billion in foreign aid spending, AID earmarks only 13 percent for what it calls "achieving sustainable development."  Of this 13 percent, most of money is spent to protect the environment, educate the poor, control populations, and immunize infants. Some of these programs may be useful, but they hardly qualify as programs aimed at promoting economic growth in less developed countries. A well-educated person living in a clean environment and given good health care will not be able to enjoy those benefits if private property is outlawed, there is no rule of law, and people are not free to work. Economic freedom, not environmental or population controls, creates economic growth.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>AID's Neglect of Economic Freedom.</b> This failure to understand the central role of economic freedom in economic development is a principal reason for AID's failed approach to foreign aid. The Heritage Foundation's 1996 <i>Index of Economic Freedom</i> evaluates the level of economic freedom in 142 countries. Examining taxation, trade and investment, banking, regulation, monetary, and other policies, the <i>Index</i> demonstrates that of these 142 countries, those with the greatest economic freedom also are the richest. Conversely, those that are the most economically repressed are the poorest. Consider the following:
<p><ul>
<li> Of the 76 countries ranked as "mostly unfree" or "repressed," 35 have received U.S. foreign aid for at least 36 years, many for as long as 52 years;
<p>
<li> Of these 35 countries, 25 are no better off economically today than they were before receiving aid;
<p>
<li> Of these 25, 13 actually are poorer today than they were over three decades ago.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The evidence in the <i>Index</i> demonstrates what many economists have known for years: No matter how much foreign aid is pumped into less developed economies, they will not grow economically until they begin to free their economies from excessive government constraint.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It was Congress's belief in this fact that prompted it last year to require that AID submit a report on economic freedom. Critics of AID will be watching to see how reliable and accurate it will be in evaluating the economic policies of U.S. aid recipients. They will be scrutinizing AID's assessment of barriers to U.S. exports, whether American companies are free to invest in other countries, and whether aid recipients still do not respect private property rights.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
With over 8,000 employees, consultants, and contractors, and $465 million in operating expenses, AID surely has enough resources to fulfill its legal obligations to Congress and the American people. By not submitting its report on economic freedom to Congress, AID is violating a specific congressional directive. Whether AID is finally giving economic freedom the attention it deserves cannot be known until it submits its report. However, one thing is already clear: The agency remains one of the most poorly run and ineffective in the U.S. government. AID should release its report on economic freedom immediately.

Conservative Successes in the 104<sup>th</sup> Congress</h3><br><hr></center><br>
<table border=0 cellspacing=5 cellpadding=5><tr><td>
Conservatives have achieved amazing success in transforming government and the way Congress does business. Despite setbacks and  presidential vetos, the 104th Congress has met the high expectations of conservatives in several key areas by beginning a revolutionary reversal of failed liberal policies in such areas as welfare, agriculture, and regulation.
<p>
	It took 60 years to build the modern welfare state, and it will take more than just two years to do what is needed to reform it. The 104th Congress, however, has taken significant steps to reduce the size of the federal government and to empower states, local communities, and individuals. President Clinton has stated that "the era of big government is over." The 104th Congress actually has done something to turn this rhetoric into reality.

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b><BR>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
U.S. military strength in Asia underpins deterrence and U.S. leadership in Asia. If the two Koreas were to reunify, American ground troops would likely be reduced, and American air power in Asia would become much more important in maintaining deterrence. China's recent purchase from Russia of co-production rights for the Sukhoi SU-27 <I>Flanker</I> jet fighter represents a significant step in Beijing's ambition to build a world-class air force. Currently, the People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) is saddled with thousands of obsolete Soviet-era combat aircraft and is deficient in advanced munitions, electronic warfare systems, logistics, and training. The SU-27 will be China's first jet fighter with capabilities roughly equivalent to current U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Marine fighters. U.S. intelligence reportedly estimates that China may obtain up to 300 SU-27s. If successful in absorbing the Sukhoi's technology and production know-how, China eventually could challenge American air superiority in Asia.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

To sustain deterrence in Asia, the U.S. must proceed with programs to build advanced fighter aircraft and munitions that will guarantee American air superiority in Asia. Specifically, the U.S. should:
<ul>
<p><li><b>Sustain funding for the F-22A jet fighter.</b> This is the only U.S. jet fighter currently in development that promises a clear level of superiority to the SU-27.

<p><li><b>Maintain 12 Navy aircraft carrier battle groups.</b> The Clinton defense budget puts at risk the Navy's ability to project power in Asia. Should budget pressures force a reduction in carrier battle groups, the Navy may be required to deploy its Seventh Fleet carrier, now homeported in Japan, to non-Asian trouble spots for increasing periods of time, thereby reducing the U.S. deterrent in Asia.

<p><li><b>Develop an air-superiority fighter for the Navy.</b> With the Navy's F-14 Tomcat to be phased out by 2010, the Navy will need a fighter that is clearly superior to the Russian SU-27.

<p><li><b>Accelerate development of a helmet-sighted missile and make advanced U.S. air-to-air missiles available to U.S. allies.</b> The U.S. and its allies should have such a system to counter current Russian helmet-sighted missiles sold to China.

<p><li><b>Develop advanced versions of the F-16 and F-18 for allied and friendly Asian air forces.</b> The danger is that the U.S. could lose sales to future European or Russian aircraft.

<p><li><b>Ask Russia and Israel to curtail sales of advanced combat aircraft and related technology to China.</b> Russia and Israel should be told that they are helping to accelerate a military modernization program that could destabilize Asia.
</ul>
<p>

<b>CHINA'S SU-27 DEAL</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In February, it was reported that Moscow and Beijing had reached agreement on a $2.2 billion deal for China to begin co-producing the Sukhoi SU-27.<sup>1</sup>  The Chinese designation for this aircraft will be the J-11. China had purchased an initial batch of 24 SU-27s in 1991 for about $1 billion. These aircraft were reported to have been delivered by the end of 1992 and are based at Wuhu Air Base, about 150 miles east of Shanghai.<sup>2</sup>  In May of last year, it was reported that China had purchased a second batch of 22 aircraft as a prelude to the larger co-production deal.<sup>3</sup>  Former Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev said the second batch of SU-27s was delivered in April.<sup>4</sup>  These aircraft will be based at Suixi Air Base in Southern China.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Estimates vary as to the final number of SU-27s that China may purchase or co-produce. According to one report, the first co-production contract would enable the Chinese to produce 40 to 60 aircraft from Russian-made components over the next three years.<sup>5</sup>  According to another source, China may obtain a total of 72 to 78 SU-27s from this deal, enough to equip three regiments of the PLAAF, followed by co-production after five years.<sup>6</sup>  Yet another source states that China will purchase 120 sets of prefabricated components for assembly in China, with indigenous production phased in later.<sup>7</sup>  Finally, a Pentagon intelligence assessment concludes that China eventually may obtain as many as 300 SU-27s.<sup>8</sup>  In any event, it is reasonable to assume that the total could exceed 100; and if China masters full co-production, the total (to include Chinese-designed variants) could exceed several hundred.
<p>

<b>COMPARING THE SU-27 WITH CURRENT U.S. FIGHTERS</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Because the SU-27 will play a significant role in modernizing the PLAAF, it is useful to compare it to existing U.S. fighter aircraft. Some key performance parameters are listed in Table 1. Since entering service in 1986, the SU-27 has been the best fourth-generation air-superiority fighter in service with the Russian Air Force.<sup>9</sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The SU-27 is roughly comparable to the F-15C, the best U.S. Air Force fighter. The F-15C is the only U.S. fighter used almost exclusively for air-superiority missions. Over 400 F-15Cs have been purchased by the United States Air Force, and 108 are deployed in U.S. Pacific Command.<sup>10</sup>  This aircraft accounted for 36 of the 39 USAF air-to-air victories in the Gulf War. The F-15C will remain the principal U.S. Air Force air-superiority fighter until replaced by the Lockheed-Martin F-22 later in the next decade.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The F-15C and the SU-27 have comparable ranges, though the SU-27 can carry ten missiles while the F-15C can carry eight. The F-15's ability to maneuver is about the same as the SU-27's.<sup>11</sup>  Both are capable of difficult maneuvers that stress the airframe to nine times the weight of the aircraft. The F-15C uses the AN/ANG-70 radar, which can detect targets about 100 miles away and can track and engage multiple targets. The SU-27's Phazatron N001 radar has a search range of over 62 miles with the ability to track 10 targets and engage two. However, unlike the F-15, the SU-27 is equipped with an infrared search and tracking (IRST) system with a range of from 15 to 31 miles that directs gun and missile systems.<sup>12</sup>  This system allows the <I>Flanker</I> to track and engage targets while turning off its radar, decreasing the chances of detection by opposing aircraft.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The Grumman F-14, the U.S. Navy's primary air-superiority fighter, is a better all-around combat interception system than the SU-27. Were it not for the F-14's swing-wing, the SU-27 might be much more maneuverable that the F-14. The F-14 can carry six long-range or medium-range and two short-range air-to-air missiles (AAMs), but its unrefueled range is less than the SU-27's. With the added flexibility of a two-man crew, the F-14A's AN/AWG-9 weapons control system can detect targets out to 190 miles, track 24, and engage six at long range with its 100-mile-range AIM-54 <I>Phoenix</I> missiles.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Fourteen Navy squadrons are now equipped with F-14As, including two deployed with the Japan-based Seventh Fleet. The F-14A's principal weakness has been its Pratt and Whitney TF-30 turbofan engines, which are prone to stalling during hard maneuvers. This has led to engine failures and many crashes. Consequently, certain combat maneuvers are now restricted until these aircraft are modified with updated control systems. All F-14As are due to be retired from service by 2004. Over 90 F-14Bs, which now equip five Navy squadrons, have been fitted with more powerful and responsive General Electric F110 engines. The Navy also has acquired 56 F-14Ds with the F110 engines and more powerful radar combat systems. Three squadrons are outfitted with the F-14D. The F-14B and D are expected to serve through the next decade. A program to build a successor to the F-14, the A/F-X, was canceled by the Clinton Administration in 1993.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Later in the next decade, as the F-14 is being retired from U.S. Navy inventory, the numerically most important U.S. Navy fighter will be the F/A-18E/F. The Navy expects to purchase over 1,000 of these aircraft by 2015. They are designed to replace the current C/D version of the F/A-18, the F-14, and the long-range ground-attack Grumman A-6 <I>Intruder</I>.<sup>13</sup>  Compared to both versions of the F/A-18, however, the SU-27 has an advantage in unrefueled range and may be more maneuverable due to its more powerful engines and larger wing. The F/A-18E/F is about 25 percent larger than the C/D; has more powerful engines and a longer range because of larger external fuel tanks; and is to be equipped presently with an AN/AGP-73 multi-mode radar, which also equips the most current production model of the F/A-18C. More advanced radar upgrades already are planned for the F/A-18E.<sup>14</sup>  In terms of offensive and defensive electronic systems, the F-18E/F will be superior to the SU-27.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The F-16 also is a multi-role fighter designed for ground-attack as well as air-defense missions. It is the most numerous combat aircraft in the U.S. Air Force, currently numbering over 1,200 aircraft. Forces with the U.S. Pacific Command possess 138 F-16Cs, the major combat aircraft for South Korea. An earlier version, the F-16A, is the most capable combat aircraft in the air forces of Indonesia, Singapore, and Thailand, and soon of Taiwan. Shorter in unrefueled range than the SU-27, the F-16C carries only six medium-range or short-range AAMs. The F-16 is a single-engine aircraft, while the SU-27, F-15, F-14, and F/A-18 are twin-engine aircraft with greater survivability in combat. The F-16 is roughly comparable to the SU-27 in maneuverability; both airframes can be stressed to nine times their weight.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The Northrop F-5E <I>Tiger II</I> currently is the most numerous combat aircraft for Taiwan, South Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The F-5E is no match for the SU-27 in maneuverability, range, or weapons load. Several companies offer upgrades for the F-5's radar and combat systems. These upgrades can ease pilot workload and increase search and detection capability, but they cannot alter the F-5's inferior aerodynamic performance. As a consequence, prosperous Asian countries are acquiring new, more capable aircraft like the F-16 and F-18.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<b>The U.S. Technology Advantage.</b> Compared to the SU-27, all current U.S. combat aircraft benefit from better cockpit design and better avionics. For example, the U.S. practice of placing most combat relevant information on a large Head-Up Display (HUD) which combines the functions of a monitor and a weapons sight, or on large, easy-to-read flat-panel displays on the instrument panel, increases combat potential by allowing pilots to spend more time watching for opposing aircraft than tending instruments. Better U.S. aircraft computers and cockpit displays enable U.S. pilots to evaluate information more quickly and accurately. By contrast, similar Russian systems used in early models of the SU-27 are less advanced. American aircraft also are equipped with better countermeasures against radar and missile threats. These include electronic jamming systems and decoys that use several methods to confuse attacking missiles.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Marine fighters have long benefited from a well-developed system of in-air refueling which extends range or combat patrol time. The U.S. also benefits from advanced airborne warning and control (AWACS) aircraft, such as the E-2C <I>Hawkeye</I> and E-3 <I>Sentry</I>. In addition, the three services employ a range of electronic intelligence aircraft that warn fighters of enemy radar and missile defenses. The Navy's EA-6B is designed to jam enemy radars, while the F-16 HTS, F/A-18, and EA-6B can use anti-radar missiles to destroy enemy air defenses.

<b>THE CHINESE AIR FORCE AND THE CHALLENGE OF THE SU-27</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The acquisition of the SU-27 and its production rights marks a major turn for the Chinese Air Force. Nevertheless, this service is beset with major weaknesses. The foremost is that the PLAAF currently is saddled with over 2,000 aircraft (including MiG-19s, MiG-21s, and TU-16s) of 1950s-era Soviet design comparable to outdated U.S. fighters like the F-100, F-8, and B-47. These aircraft are no match for current U.S. jet fighters. In addition, the Chinese Air Force lacks the capability to refuel its combat aircraft during flight, and this shortens their range. It also is bereft of AWACS aircraft that manage air battles, fire-and-forget long-range air-to-air missiles, anti-radar missiles to attack enemy air defenses, and precision-guided munitions (PGMs) like laser-guided bombs. These systems were critical to U.S. air superiority during the Persian Gulf War.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The PLAAF compares poorly to the USAF and some Asian air forces in areas of training and maintenance. A RAND Corporation study issued last year concludes that Chinese Air Force pilots do not fly as often as their U.S. counterparts.<sup>15</sup>  Chinese pilots typically fly 100 hours a year, while U.S. pilots train more than 200 hours per year. Chinese air combat tactics resemble old Soviet-style tactics that stress tight ground control of aircraft.<sup>16</sup>  PLAAF commanders place a high priority on flight safety, and this reduces pilots' initiative and inhibits the utilization of aircraft to their fullest capabilities. While the PLAAF is beginning to utilize "Aggressor" squadrons which specialize in adversarial combat tactics in an attempt to raise tactical skills proficiency, it remains to be seen whether these new training squadrons will be effective. The PLAAF also faces another severe problem:  a lack of spare parts. One of the reasons for this is that production standards vary between differing aircraft and engine manufacturers, inhibiting interchangability of parts between aircraft and engines of the same type.<sup>17</sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

RAND questioned whether China can afford the SU-27 as well as indigenous aircraft programs, pointing to recent reforms that have devalued China's currency, thereby reducing PLA purchasing power.<sup>18</sup>  However, the actual size of China's defense budget is unknown. Official figures typically fail to include all military-related expenditures and earnings from PLA-controlled businesses. For example, while the official 1994 PLA defense budget figure was $6 billion, the Washington-based Defense Budget Project estimates that it could range between $92 billion and $143 billion.<sup>19</sup>  A higher budget such as this increases the possibility that the PLA could afford multiple new aircraft programs.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The RAND study estimated that China would have only 70 SU-27s in the year 2005.<sup>20</sup>  The SU-27 co-production agreement suggests that China has placed a greater emphasis on acquiring higher numbers of this aircraft in addition to its production technology. The PLA appears to want a phased transition to full co-production, preceded by domestic assembly of a large number of aircraft from major components fabricated in Russia. Co-production of the SU-27 will be difficult for the Chinese because this aircraft incorporates technologies the Chinese cannot yet produce. But PLA aircraft manufacturers will benefit from advanced Russian production techniques and from the presence of Russian technicians, who will assist SU-27 assembly and eventual production.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<b>Chinese Air Force Difficulties with the SU-27.</b> Integrating the SU-27 into its inventory will not be easy for the PLAAF. The Chinese Air Force has had difficulty maintaining the SU-27 and was not prepared for its additional cost. Moreover, some runways are not capable of handling this heavier fighter aircraft.<sup>21</sup>  However, the SU-27 is being used in exercises. In August 1995, Chinese SU-27s approached the Senkaku Islands north of Taiwan, which are claimed by China, Japan, and Taiwan. And in March 1996, the SU-27 flew in major military exercises intended to intimidate Taiwan on the eve of its presidential election. The SU-27 possibly will be seen more frequently over the South China Sea, flying from Suixi Air Base in South China. From Wuhu and Suixi Bases, the SU-27 can reach Taiwan, many disputed areas in the South China Sea, and U.S. forces based on Okinawa (see map). Despite early difficulties in tactics and training, as well as enduring PLAAF institutional constraints, it is entirely possible that as more SU-27s enter service, the PLAAF will learn how to exploit this system to its fullest capabilities some time in the next decade.

OTHER TECHNOLOGIES THAT MAY ASSIST CHINA'S AIR FORCE MODERNIZATION

	</b><P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Advanced military technology from Russia and Israel plays a major role in China's effort to modernize its military forces. This is especially true for the PLAAF. Russia in particular is viewed by China as a potential source for many systems and technologies that comprise a modern, all-weather, multi-mission air force. Advanced air-to-air missiles, precision-guided munitions, radar aircraft, and electronic countermeasures are all on China's shopping list. For now, Russia appears to be more interested in profit than in any potential threat to its interests arising from sales to China.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<b>Advantage <i>Archer</i>.</b> The SU-27 is equipped with a series of advanced Russian missiles that in some cases exceed or equal U.S. missile capabilities. The PLAAF is the only air force in Asia to possess the Russian R-73 (NATO codename:  AA-11 <i>Archer</i>) air-to-air missile. China is believed to have an early version of the <i>Archer </i>(M1) and is known to have used it against parachute flares during March 1996 exercises near Taiwan. The AA-11 is the first effective "helmet-sighted" air-to-air missile to be employed anywhere. With this missile, a pilot can aim his weapon by turning his head, and does not have to line up his plane with the target, which has been the main practice in aerial combat since World War I. The M1 version can be fired 45 degrees off the aircraft's forward line-of-direction, or off-boresight, to a range of 12.4 miles (see chart).<sup>22</sup>  The M2 version of the AA-11 can be fired up to 60 degrees off-boresight and has a range of 18.6 miles.<sup>23</sup>  In targeting aircraft beyond visual range, the AA-11 can be cued by the <i>Flanker's </i>infrared tracking system.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In the hands of a capable pilot, the <i>Archer </i>conveys a decisive margin for victory. During 1994 air combat exercises between German and U.S. aircraft, MiG-29s of the German Air Force armed with the less capable version of the <i>Archer </i>had a clear advantage over U.S. F-16s armed with <i>Sidewinder</i>.<sup>24</sup>  Even though the F-16 was able to outmaneuver the MiG in 60 percent of the exercise engagements, the MiG already had "fired" its <i>Archer</i>, meaning the F-16 most likely was defeated.<sup>25</sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The U.S. is not expected to field a helmet-sighted thrust-vectored AAM for at least six years. The AIM-9M <i>Sidewinder</i>, the most modern U.S. short-range air-to-air missile -- which lacks a helmet sight -- can acquire targets only 27.5 degrees off the forward line-of-sight and has a range of only 4.8 miles. American defense officials assert that the lack of a helmet-sighted missile is compensated for by the 32-mile-range Advanced Medium-Range Air to Air Missile (AMRAAM). This missile, called the AIM-120, is guided by its own radar, allowing the pilot to break aircraft radar contact with the target and begin evasion. This was not the case with earlier U.S. radar-guided missiles. U.S. officials argue that the AIM-120 confers much of the same tactical flexibility as the <i>Archer</i>.<sup>26</sup>  However, the U.S. still has some difficulty in exploiting the long range of the AIM-120. For one thing, it has problems with identifying targets.<sup>27</sup>  Moreover, this missile cannot be used by the F-16A or the F-5E. While U.S. fighters in Asia have the AIM-120, so far only South Korea and Thailand are approved to buy it. Equipped with AIM-120, the F-15, F-14, F-16, and F/A-18 all have a fighting chance against the SU-27. But the Russians also have their AIM-120 equivalent in the AA-12. This missile could be marketed to China in the future, and apparently has been offered for sale to the U.S.<sup>28</sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

China also could acquire newer, more advanced Russian missiles and precision-guided munitions. For example, the Kh-17 (NATO codename:  AS-17 <i>Krypton</i>) missile has multiple versions that are designed to attack ships and AWACS radar aircraft at long range. The U.S. Navy is evaluating this missile for possible use as a target to simulate future threats for naval missile defense systems. One version of this missile is credited with a 125-mile range, and all versions are capable of flying at almost three times the speed of sound.<sup>29</sup>  U.S. Naval Intelligence also is concerned about a new 200-mile-range AAM designed to attack AWACS and other long-range radar aircraft.<sup>30</sup>  Russia also produces a series of laser-guided and television-guided bombs that could arm future variants of the SU-27 produced by China.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<b>Russian Technology and China's SU-27s.</b> Russia now plans to market advanced versions of the SU-27 to China, as it already has to India. There are reports that a deal for China to purchase the more advanced SU-30 broke down over financing disagreements.<sup>31</sup>  The SU-30 is a two-seat dedicated attack variant of the SU-27 with more advanced attack systems that allow for delivery of precision-guided munitions.<sup>32</sup>  Moscow and Beijing also may have discussed Chinese co-production of the SU-35.<sup>33</sup>  The SU-35 features a better cockpit display, better missile fire-control systems, and forward horizontal control surfaces that boost maneuverability. According to Lt. General George Muellner, Principal Deputy to the Air Force Assistant Secretary, the SU-35's "missile fire control system is as good or better than the F-15."<sup>34</sup>  Sukhoi unveiled last year a variant of the SU-35 with thrust-vectored engines, called the SU-37, which Russian pilots claim will be "10-times" better in close-in dogfights than unmodified fighters.<sup>35</sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<b>AWACS and Aerial Refueling.</b> A number of reports indicate China also is seeking other "force-multipliers" the U.S. has long utilized, like AWACS and air-refueling capabilities. Russian AWACS aircraft and Israel's <i>Phalcon </i>early-warning aircraft appear to be on Beijing's shopping list.<sup>36</sup>  In a reported $250 million deal with China, Israel will put its <i>Phalcon </i>200-mile-range airborne early warning radar on a Russian Il-76 transport aircraft.<sup>37</sup>  This aircraft may also carry advanced Israeli electronic sensing and intelligence systems. China is reported to have modified up to five of its H-6 bombers to refuel J-8II <i>Finback </i>fighters -- the most advanced fighter China currently produces. This extends the range of the J-8II from 430 to over 630 miles. U.S. intelligence reportedly estimates China may convert up to 20 H-6 bombers into air-to-air refueling aircraft.<sup>38</sup>  China's SU-27s are not modified for air-to-air refueling, but this capability could be acquired later.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

China is using Russian technology to upgrade the J-8II with modern radar and engines which give the aircraft greater combat capability.<sup>39</sup>  An upgraded version of this aircraft, the J-8II M, was test-flown at the end of March.<sup>40</sup> There are about 200 J-8s in the Chinese Naval Air Force and Air Force. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

China is co-developing the FC-1 lightweight fighter with Pakistan which also may use a Russian engine radar and avionics, or a European radar.<sup>41</sup>This aircraft may be slightly less maneuverable than the F-16, and China initially may buy 100 copies. The FC-1 also could be marketed as a low-cost successor to aircraft such as the F-5E and Mig-21, which continue to be used widely in less-developed countries.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<b>Israeli Assistance and China's J-10 Advanced Fighter Program.</b> Israel maintains a quiet but significant military technology relationship with China. Its largest military program with China involves the development of the J-10 advanced fighter aircraft, modeled on Israel's <i>Lavi </i>fighter that was canceled in 1987.<sup>42</sup>  Russian radar and engines also may feature prominently in the J-10 program.<sup>43</sup>  Last year, RAND Corporation analyst Mark Lorell concluded that the J-10 will benefit from the <i>Lavi's </i>"advanced airframe technology, [and] superior avionics.... "<sup>44</sup> China revealed in April a model of the J-10 that was similar to the <i>Lavi</i>. The model also showed the J-10 armed with the PL-10 short-range air-to-air missile, a copy of the Israeli <i>Python </i><i>3 </i>missile. The U.S. Office of Naval Intelligence estimates the J-10 may be more maneuverable than the F/A-18E/F but will carry less sophisticated radar and countermeasures.<sup>45</sup>  The first prototype may fly this year, and China eventually may produce 300 J-10s.<sup>46</sup>  Washington is concerned that U.S.-originated technology from the <i>Lavi </i>has been transferred to China.<sup>47</sup>  Israel is reported to have rebuffed Clinton Administration attempts to end this program.<sup>48</sup>

<b>Could China's SU-27 Go to Sea?</b> Central Military Commission (CMC) Vice President Liu Haquing, a former top PLA Navy commander, believes China needs the ability to dominate the Pacific from Japan down to the Philippines and should be able to fight as far away as Guam.<sup>49</sup>  Acquiring an aircraft carrier to help fulfill this goal appears to be a high PLA priority, and there are reports that at a December meeting of the CMC, President Jaing Zemin endorsed construction of an aircraft carrier as part of the next five-year plan.<sup>50</sup>  However, the cost of a carrier and its attendant defensive and logistic support ships may prove prohibitive for the Chinese Navy. But should China acquire its first aircraft carrier, perhaps in the next decade, the U.S. could face a Chinese sea-borne version of the SU-27. China could follow the example of Russia, which now uses a version of the SU-27 (called the SU-33) as the principal combat aircraft for its sole aircraft carrier, the <I>Admiral Kuznetzov.</I> Unlike the basic version of the SU-27, the SU-33 is equipped for air-to-air refueling, both to receive fuel and to carry a modified fuel tank that can perform in-flight refueling. The SU-33's engines generate enough thrust to allow the use of a ski-jump to get airborne, eliminating the need for complex steam-driven catapults used on U.S. Navy carriers.
<p>

<b>MEETING THE CHALLENGE OF CHINA'S SU-27</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

American leadership in Asia rests upon several factors, including a willingness to maintain sufficient military force to deter potential adversaries. In the event Korea is reunified, the U.S. very likely will withdraw ground troops stationed there, leaving the Air Force and the Navy to function as the dominant elements of the U.S. military presence in Asia. The U.S. Pacific Command now relies on about 350 Air Force, Navy, and Marine fighter and attack aircraft deployed in South Korea, Japan, Alaska, and Hawaii. One aircraft carrier, the <I>USS Independence</I>, provides the most flexible component of American airpower in Asia. In March 1996, two carrier battle groups, led by the <i>Independence </i>and the <I>USS Nimitz</I>, were ordered to locations near Taiwan in response to China's threatening military exercises. The U.S. reportedly has decided to halt regular Middle East deployments by the <I>Independence</I> in order to respond to possible scenarios involving North Korea or China.<sup>51</sup>  Such is the importance of U.S. naval power to peace and stability in Asia.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Were it to occur, China's acquisition of large numbers of SU-27s would pose a serious challenge to U.S. air superiority. Since World War II, American military commanders have aimed to establish air superiority in order to win battles on the sea and ground. Although China may not today be able to utilize the SU-27 to its fullest extent, it cannot be assumed that this will continue indefinitely. To sustain deterrence, the U.S. needs to maintain its all-around edge in strategy, tactics, and weapons systems.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In particular, aircraft that are "good enough" or slightly superior to the SU-27 do not provide a sufficient margin of superiority to guarantee U.S. dominance in the air. The U.S. must proceed with plans to field advanced combat aircraft superior to the SU-27. Current and future aircraft must be equipped with an effective helmet-sighted missile to counter the <i>Archer</i>. Failure to do so risks allowing the Asian balance of power to shift dangerously in favor of China. To prevent this from happening, Washington should:<p>

<b>Sustain funding for the F-22A jet fighter.</b><br>
To ensure U.S. air superiority in Asia, the U.S. should proceed with full funding for the Lockheed-Martin F-22A. This aircraft promises better uses of radar-evading stealth technology, engines that can achieve supersonic speeds without using fuel-guzzling afterburners, thrust vectoring that enhances maneuverability at high speeds, and advanced radar and electronic combat systems. It can carry four short-range air-to-air missiles and up to ten AMRAAM missiles and has a combat range comparable to the F-15C. There are suggestions from Pentagon officials that the planned purchase of 442 F-22As may be cut in half due to funding constraints.<sup>52</sup>  This would be a mistake because it would likely reduce the number of F-22As, which are needed to deter potential adversaries. The Air Force is requesting $2 billion for FY 1997 for research and development as part of an expected $70 billion program. This is indeed expensive, but the F-22A is the only U.S. fighter in development that can offer decisive air superiority for U.S. forces.
<p>
<b>Maintain 12 Navy aircraft carrier battle groups.</b><br>
The U.S. Navy needs at least 12 aircraft carrier battle groups in order to sustain peacetime security commitments. These commitments include the maintenance of one carrier battle group with the Seventh Fleet in Japan. However, the Clinton defense budget could force a reduction to eight carrier battle groups by the year 2002. If this occurs, the U.S. may have to deploy its Seventh Fleet carrier to potential crisis areas outside of Asia,<sup>53</sup> in which case carriers would not be available to respond sufficiently to some future Chinese provocation against Taiwan. This would be regarded by Washington's friends and potential adversaries in Asia as a significant reduction in the traditional U.S. commitment to preserve peace in Asia. To deter future potential conflicts in Asia that could damage U.S. economic and military security, the U.S. must have 12 carrier battle groups to sustain deterrence.
<p>
<b>Develop an air-superiority fighter for the Navy.</b><br>
The Clinton Administration should review its 1993 decision to forgo development of a dedicated successor to the Navy's F-14 fighter aircraft. The A/F-X program, canceled in 1993, had attracted proposals from Lockheed to develop a naval variant of the F-22. If U.S. naval task forces are to be superior to all opponents, the Navy will need a fighter with at least the capability of the F-22. While the F/A-18E/F is an impressive aircraft that incorporates advances in air combat and ground-attack systems, it does not present a decisive advance in capability over the SU-27/35 family. The Navy needs the F/A-18E/F to fulfill fighter and ground attack missions. But the Navy also needs an aircraft that will guarantee naval air superiority against the SU-27 and its advanced variants. In the meantime, as the F-14A is cycled out of Navy inventory early in the next decade, it is essential that the Asia-deployed Seventh Fleet receive priority in retaining F-14B/Ds.
<p>
The only other major combat aircraft program in the Navy's future is the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF), which is scheduled to enter service after 2010. But this aircraft also is the next major aircraft program for the Marines and the Air Force. In all, the JSF is intended to replace such diverse aircraft as the A-6, the AV-8 <i>Harrier</i>, Britain's <I>Sea Harrier</I>, the F-14, the F-16, and the F-18. The Air Force wants an F-16 replacement that is inexpensive, while the Navy seeks stealthy long-range strike aircraft. The JSF is not expected to be much larger or much more maneuverable than an F-16, but it will incorporate stealth and advanced combat systems. According to General Muellner, for the Air Force, the JSF would "not be on the leading edge of air supremacy," but would compliment the F-22.<sup>54</sup>  The Navy version of the JSF should pay greater attention to the air-superiority mission, meaning increased range and increased internal air-to-air missile carriage; if it cannot approach the air superiority capabilities of the F-22, the Navy should be directed to begin development of a fighter that provides a dedicated replacement for the F-14.
<p>
<b>Accelerate development of a helmet-sighted missile and make advanced U.S. air-to-air missiles available to U.S. allies.</b><br>
It is critical that the Pentagon be directed to accelerate the development of a helmet-sighted and highly maneuverable short-range AAM. Israel, for example, was able to field its 90-degree off-boresight-capable, helmet-sighted <I>Python 4</I> short-range AAM in about half the time it is expected to take the U.S. to field its helmet-sighted AAM.<sup>55</sup>  A former senior Joint Chiefs of Staff officer was quoted recently as saying that "For the Air Force and Navy not to have a helmet-mounted sight and off-boresight missile is absolutely criminal."<sup>56</sup>  U.S. aircraft and those of Asian allies armed only with <i>Sidewinder </i>AAMs are at a distinct disadvantage when compared with Chinese SU-27s armed with the Russian <i>Archer </i>AAM. When a helmet-sighted missile enters U.S. service, it also should be made available for sale to Asian allies and friends. In the meantime, the U.S. should sell the AIM-120 to allies and friends with compatible aircraft. Specifically, the AIM-120 should be offered to the Republic of China as its F-16s enter service next year.
<p>
<b>Develop advanced versions of the F-15, F-16, and F-18 for allied and friendly Asian air forces.</b><br>
Most countries in Asia, except possibly Japan, will not be able to afford the F-22. The JSF also may prove to be too expensive. Therefore, the U.S. should develop advanced, more affordable versions of the F-16 and the F/A-18E/F for Asian friends and allies. The danger is that unmodified U.S. types could lose markets to newer and very capable European combat aircraft like the French <I>Rafale</I> and the <I>Eurofighter-2000</I>.<sup>57</sup>  Maintaining commonality between U.S. and Asian air forces is an important U.S. interest.
<p>
<b>Ask Russia and Israel to curtail advanced weapons sales to China.</b><br>
Sales of advanced military technology to China do more than strengthen China's military capabilities:  They also constitute a potential threat to regional peace and stability. To Russia, the U.S. should stress that a well-armed China could be less benign and more inclined, for example, to press old territorial claims. To Israel, the U.S. should stress that China might sell advanced aircraft to rogue states like Iran which pose a threat to Israel. Last June, for example, China was suspected of having shipped missile components or technology to Syria.<sup>58</sup>  The U.S. also should enlist its allies and friends in Asia to warn Russia and Israel that by arming China, they are creating a potential threat to peace.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

For over 50 years, the United States has enjoyed air superiority in Asia. American industry has produced combat aircraft that have been proven superior over Korea, the Taiwan Strait, Vietnam, the Middle East, and the Persian Gulf. With the demise of the Soviet Union, delay in building a fifth-generation fighter to succeed the F-15 and F-14 was justifiable. But should it occur, China's acquisition of a large inventory of SU-27 aircraft would present a major challenge to American air superiority in Asia. This poses the first major post-Cold War challenge to U.S. strategy in Asia, as America's ability to deter conflict in Asia will rely increasingly on air power.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

To preserve U.S. air superiority and sustain deterrence in Asia in the next century, the U.S. should produce the F-22A jet fighter, field a helmet-sighted air to air missile, and make the AIM-120 advanced air to air missile available to allies and friends like the Republic of China. Equally important, it also is time to re-examine whether an F-14 follow-on must be built if U.S. naval air power is to retain the superiority critical to sustaining the credibility of U.S. naval forces in Asia. Finally, the U.S. should tell Russia and Israel that their sale to China of advanced weapons and technology is helping to create a potential threat to the peace and stability of the Asia region.

  <p><li> The F-15 has slightly better thrust-to-weight ratio, though wing-loadings are even at combat weights. A greater thrust-to-weight ratio and a lower wing-loading confers better combat potential. These variables help determine acceleration and turn rate in combat, and improve as aircraft weight decreases through fuel consumption. The SU-27 is said to have an instantaneous turn rate of 20 to 22 degrees per second and a sustained turn rate of 14 to 16 degrees per second. Comparable figures for the F-15 are 14 degrees and 12 degrees; see Dennis R.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The 104th Congress has kept its promise to the American people that it would begin to cut regulatory red tape and return common sense to regulation. It has reduced the size and cost of government and increased the health and well-being of all Americans. But alarmists have done a good job of convincing the American people that exactly the opposite has been true, seizing the moral high ground with rhetoric designed to convince the public that a reformed regulatory system would have disastrous consequences. Nevertheless, this Congress can point to a record of solid reforms and progress toward a more flexible and less burdensome regulatory system that will cost less and achieve the same or higher levels of public health, safety, and environmental protection.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
What is the reality?  Legislation passed by the 104th Congress and signed into law:
<p>
<ul> 
<li> Repealed the federally mandated 55-mph speed limit that had been on the books since 1974.
<p>
<li> Deregulated two major industries: agriculture and telecommunications. Farmers will now be able to grow what their customers want, not what bureaucrats demand.
<p>
<li> Stemmed the tide of costly new unfunded mandates on states and localities.
<p>
<li> Moved away from "one-size-fits-all" regulations by making it easier for the needs of small businesses to be taken into consideration.
<p>
<li> Established clear goals for agencies to reduce the paperwork burden, which will save Americans as much as 70 million hours of their time (valued at more than $1 billion) this year to use for more productive activities.
<p>
<li> Made itself directly accountable to the public by giving itself the authority to review and stop burdensome, unjustified new regulations developed by federal regulators.
<p>
<li> Forced a review by the Clinton Administration of all existing and proposed federal regulations.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In addition, Congress:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Passed and sent to the President the Comprehensive Regulatory Reform Act, which would have required federal regulators to follow a set of rational principles in deciding whether and how to regulate. These include the use of cost-benefit analysis, sound science, and risk assessment, as well as market-based alternatives and performance standards. President Clinton vetoed this bill.
<p>
<li> Passed and sent to the President with bipartisan support the Common Sense Liability Reform Act which would have curbed abuses of the legal system by relieving the crushing burden of frivolous and unfounded cases brought against state and local governments, charitable organizations, and America's product manufacturers. President Clinton vetoed this bill.
<p>
<li> Passed legislation to reduce the existing burdens of the Safe Drinking Water Act, one the largest unfunded environmental mandates. Signed by President Clinton on August 6, 1996, the legislation will give states and localities the flexibility to target their resources more effectively to achieve greater levels of protection.
<p>
<li> Started an important national debate about how to resurrect commonsense regulation. This Congress, for example, introduced proposals to restructure the Superfund program in ways that would encourage faster cleanups, eliminate most of the need for lawyers and the courts, and reduce federal spending while improving public health, safety, and the environment. Unfortunately, the Clinton Administration so far has blocked reform, choosing to leave in place a program in which one-third of the money will continue to go to lawyers and transaction costs while failing to clean up many of the most hazardous waste sites.
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Taken together, in just 18 months this Congress has accomplished and initiated the most significant changes in more than 20 years, and has changed the terms of the debate in a way that will affect the shape of federal regulation for decades.

<p>
<b>THE BOLDEST AGENDA IN 20 YEARS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Alarmists did a good job in this first round, convincing the American public that regulatory reform was just another term for the rollback of important public health, safety, and environmental protections. As a result, Congress has not yet seen many of its most ambitious efforts to reform the Superfund program, the Endangered Species Act, the Clean Water and Clean Air Acts, the Food and Drug Administration, or the Occupational Safety and Health Administration signed into law. Many in Congress believe they lost the battle to reduce the burden of regulation and cut away the approximately $700 billion in red tape<sup>2</sup> that strangles American businesses and consumers.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Nothing, however, could be further from the truth. In less than two years, the 104th Congress accomplished unprecedented and far-reaching reforms that impose discipline on the federal regulatory decisionmaking process, deregulate the agriculture and telecommunications industries, and fundamentally change the way the federal government and the American people think about public health, safety, and environmental regulation.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>Surpassing Reagan.</b> The regulatory agenda of the 104th Congress is the boldest of the past 20 years. The successful enactment of legislation to deregulate the agriculture and telecommunications industries is comparable to the transportation deregulation successes of the late 1970s.<sup>3</sup>  Although the Reagan Administration had bold intentions to reverse the growth of economic and social regulation, the completed action fell short. Other than modest steps to deregulate the energy and communications industries and a new administrative review process that enjoyed some success in reducing the rate and cost of new rules, for example, the Reagan Administration could not follow through with new versions of the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and Superfund, or with FDA or OSHA reform.<sup>4</sup>  Thus, the 104th Congress stands alone in the scope and scale of its reform efforts. Until now, the deregulatory accomplishments of the last 20 years focused on freeing industries to rely on market forces. But the 104th Congress also has taken on for the first time the rapid expansion of major health, safety, and environmental programs which have increased steadily since the 1970s. The costs of these "social" regulations, particularly environmental regulation, has almost tripled over the last 20 years from about $80 billion in 1977 to more than $220 billion in 1995.<sup>5</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The 104th Congress needed to take such bold action because the problems have never been worse. For example:
<p>
<ul>
<li> According to <a href="/atr/1.html">Americans for Tax Reform</a>, the total cost of government has been estimated at $3.38 trillion, nearly $1 trillion of which results from federal and state regulation. The federal government is responsible for imposing more than $700 billion in regulatory costs each year: more than $2,800 for every man, woman, and child in America. Of the 366 days in 1996, the average American will work 184.6 days for the government. More than 40 of these days will be just to pay for the cost of federal regulations.<sup>6</sup>
<p>
<li> As the number of regulations has grown, so has the number of federal regulators enforcing these rules. The number of permanent, full-time regulatory staff has increased from 69,946 in 1970 to 128,566 in 1994.<sup>7</sup>
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
 And more is not always better. A seminal new study from Harvard University reveals that roughly 60,000 lives are lost every year because of the current command-and-control regulatory system, which squanders billions of dollars on efforts to eliminate risks that are negligible or nonexistent while failing to protect the public from others that are much more serious.<sup>8</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The 104th Congress has fought to bring common sense back to the way federal agencies make decisions about whether and how to regulate to improve the environment and public health and safety. Today, federal regulators are no longer giving Americans the highest levels of protection for the billions of dollars they take from taxpayers, consumers, and businesses. By making sure that regulators follow rational principles that tell them to evaluate risks sensibly and consistently, consider the costs and benefits of their actions, and use market-based solutions, policymakers can do an even better job of protecting the environment and public health and safety while spending less and with fewer rules.
<p>
<b>COMMONSENSE REGULATORY REFORMS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In just 18 months, the 104th Congress has put in place a number of important reforms that will provide significant benefits to the economy and the well-being of all Americans.
<p>
<b>The Telecommunications Act of 1996</b><br>
The 104th Congress succeeded in passing the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-104), signed into law by President Clinton on February 8, 1996. This is the most important industry-wide deregulatory initiative undertaken by Congress in over a decade. The Act removes unnecessary layers of federal rules governing telephone, cable, and broadcasting competition.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The Act eventually will eliminate restrictions that prohibit competition between local and long-distance companies, as well as cable companies, so that they can offer consumers a full range of communications and entertainment services.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
One 1993 study estimated that complete deregulation would help create 3.6 million more jobs by 2003 and pass along savings of roughly $63 billion a year to consumers.<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Although the Telecommunications Act does not go quite as far as the more rapid, comprehensive deregulation this study envisioned, comparable gains can still be expected over time as a result of the bill.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Deregulation also will mean the end of the Cable Act of 1992, numerous restrictions on beneficial merger and alliance activity, and many other needless Federal Communications Commission activities.
<p>

<b>The Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996</b><br>
The Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform (FAIR) Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-127) eliminates federal programs that manipulate production and prices of major crops (wheat, feed grains, cotton, and rice) through production subsidies and acreage reduction. This legislation will mean greater freedom and enormous opportunities for rural America. By dismantling much of the restrictive straitjacket on farmers, the new law will free the U.S. economy -- farmers and related businesses -- to take full advantage of the growing global market, which should mean huge economic benefits for Americans. According to an analysis by The Heritage Foundation,<sup>10</sup> the new law will mean that:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Farmers will earn an additional $16 billion in net income between 1996 and 2002.
<p>
<li> Suppliers of the inputs used in agricultural production will sell an additional $14.6 billion in products during the same period.
<p>
<li> Taken together, the agriculture community will enjoy a rise of $30.6 billion in income.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In addition, the Act establishes an Environmental Quality Improvement Program to provide funds for a cooperative effort with farmers to protect wetlands, using a flexible, incentive-oriented approach while increasing wetland acreage under the conservation program. 
<p>
<b>The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995</b><br>
In response to the increasingly hostile reaction of states and localities to unchecked and costly federal mandates, Congress in March 1995 enacted the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (P.L. 104-4). The Act requires Congress to take into consideration the cost to states, localities, and Indian tribes of new mandates. Federal agencies must assess the impact of new regulations both on state, local, and tribal governments and on the private sector; and the U.S. Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations is tasked with a review of existing mandates.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
One year later, states already feel the relief from new unfunded mandates.<sup>11</sup>  Thanks to this legislation, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) is tasked with estimating the costs of these new legislative mandates. Now many Members of Congress can find out the costs of proposed mandates and reduce the cost to the states.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Some examples of how these additional consultations and deliberations have resulted in important policy changes that saved hundreds of millions dollars:
<blockquote><p>
<b>Immigration.</b> The benefits of CBO's input were evident in the development of the immigration bill. Originally, the Senate bill required that all drivers' licenses without valid Social Security numbers would be invalid immediately upon the date of enactment of the law. CBO estimated that this would cost from $80 million-$200 million for states that would have to purchase new equipment and make other necessary changes to handle the volume of people who suddenly would need to have new licenses issued. <sup>12</sup> This provision was changed in the final legislation to allow for a six-year phase-in period during which states could renew licenses when they normally would come up for renewal. This dropped the costs to states to around $20 million.
<p>
<b>Agriculture.</b> The House version of the farm bill contained provisions that would require milk sold for fluid uses to contain greater amounts of nonfat solids than currently required and lock in higher fluid milk prices under the archaic Milk Marketing Order System. CBO estimated the direct costs of this provision to dairy processors and manufacturers at somewhere between $800 million and $1 billion annually. The final farm bill did not contain a national higher fluid milk standard, and CBO's estimates were used to help make the case for its elimination.<sup>13</sup>
<p>
<b>Health Care.</b> The Kennedy-Kassebaum health care reform bill initially included a provision that would have required insurers to provide the same benefits for mental health coverage as for other illnesses, and the case for dropping this unjustified mandate was greatly facilitated by CBO estimates of the cost. The CBO noted that imposing this mandated benefit on private health insurance would have huge public and private sector costs. It projected that the Senate mandate would impose $423 million in additional costs on the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) between 1996 and 2002, rising to $739 million by 2005. If it was applied to Medicare and Medicaid, program outlays would increase by almost $80 billion for Medicare between 1997 and 2000, and by another $35 billion for Medicaid during the same period. CBO also estimated that the premiums for traditional fee-for-service plans would increase by 5.3 percent, while managed care plans would see an increase of 4 percent.<sup>14</sup>  The costly provision was taken out of the bill.
</blockquote><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In addition:
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>The National Highway System Designation Act (P.L. 104-59)</b> ended a burdensome, costly unfunded mandate requiring states to satisfy a minimum tonnage utilization requirement for asphalt pavement containing recycled rubber on federal-aid projects. According to the CBO, the Federal Highway Administration estimates that states would save up to $1 billion annually in paving costs by not having to comply with the crumb rubber requirements.<sup>15</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>Amendments to the 1990 Clean Air Act employee commute option (ECO) program (P.L. 104-70)</b> make the program optional for states if they can undertake alternative methods that will achieve equivalent emissions reductions. While the EPA had estimated the cost of the ECO program at $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion annually,<sup>16</sup> it also called the impact of the program "minuscule" because it proved to be relatively ineffective at achieving emission reductions.<sup>17</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>The Land Disposal Program Flexibility Act (P.L. 104-119)</b> exempts waste determined to be non-hazardous under the Clean Water Act or Safe Drinking Water Act from regulation under the Solid Waste Disposal Act, since chemical compounds safe enough to drink presumably are safe enough to bury. Municipal solid waste landfills likewise are exempt from ground water monitoring requirements if they are small (waste disposals of less than 20 tons daily).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>Repeal of the federal speed limit.</b> As part of the National Highway system bill that President Clinton signed on November 28, 1995, the federally mandated 55-mph speed limit was repealed unconditionally. Beginning on December 8, 1995, states were able to begin freely adjusting speed limits within their boundaries. Several states immediately took action to raise their limits in response to the bill.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

<b>Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996</b> Small businesses are the engine of economic growth in this country. For small business owners, Washington looms as "public enemy number one." Small businesses want to get government off their backs so they can do what they do best -- create jobs and generate tax revenue -- without the excessive burden of reporting and regulatory compliance.<sup>18</sup>  Regulation also does not affect all businesses equally. "One-size-fits-all" regulations impose the heaviest burden on small and medium-sized businesses because they find it harder to spread the high overhead costs of paperwork, attorney and accountant fees, and staff time needed to negotiate the federal regulatory maze.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In response to the concerns of small business, Congress passed the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA) of 1996 (P.L. 104-121), which was signed by the President on March 29, 1996. This legislation:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Authorizes judicial enforcement of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, which requires agencies to provide information on the impact of their regulations on small businesses and other entities;
<p>
<li> Allows small business to recoup expenses and legal fees incurred when agencies make excessive demands for penalties that cannot be sustained in court;
<p>
<li> Provides for an independent ombudsman to receive confidential complaints from small businesses about their dealings with federal regulators; and
<p>
<li> Requires federal agencies to prepare "Plain English" compliance guides spelling out in easy-to-follow language how small businesses can comply with federal regulations.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The 104th Congress deserves credit for this modest reform in the face of the Clinton Administration's overwhelming opposition to more fundamental reforms that small businesses desperately need. For example, President Clinton vetoed a number of important regulatory, tax, and legal reforms proposed by the 104th Congress that were important priorities not just for small businesses, but for all businesses so they can promote economic growth and create more jobs. These included environmental and workplace reform, secure property rights, a reform of outdated labor laws, repeal of Davis-Bacon, capital gains tax reduction, estate tax reform, tax equity in health care reform, pension reform, and tort reform.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995</b> More than one-third of the costs of regulation -- about $200 billion -- in 1995 was due to paperwork.<sup>19</sup>  Thus, even a modest reduction in the total paperwork burden imposed on the public can save Americans thousands of hours of time and hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars in lost productivity. Most Americans fill out some kind of paperwork, such as federal tax forms or forms to obtain some type of government benefit. Businesses also must maintain a myriad of records to demonstrate compliance with environment, workplace, and other rules.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Intent on easing the burden imposed by the federal government on individuals and businesses, the 104th Congress voted overwhelmingly to pass the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (P.L. 104-13), and President Clinton signed it into law on May 22, 1995. The Act further amended and recodified the original Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. The new law sets a government-wide paperwork reduction goal of 10 percent in each of the first two years after its enactment, and 5 percent from FY 1998 through FY 2001.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The General Accounting Office (GAO) recently released a report showing that the number of hours of paperwork imposed by the government rose by 500 million in the one-month period immediately before the effective date of the Act, from 6.39 billion hours on August 30, 1995, to 6.90 billion hours on September 30, 1995.<sup>20</sup>  The estimated burden imposed by OSHA rose the most dramatically, from 1.5 million hours to about 208 million hours.<sup>21</sup>  These significant increases were due to the fact that the new law forced agencies to more accurately acknowledge the level of paperwork burden they impose on the public.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The GAO projects that federal agencies are expected to reduce the paperwork burden by about one percent in FY 1996.<sup>22</sup>  For the first time since 1989, Congress has managed to force a decrease of as much as 70 million hours in the government paperwork burden. This is equivalent to allowing 36,350 people now working full-time on paperwork each year to engage in other, more productive activities.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>The Congressional Review Act of 1996</b> For too long, federal agencies have blamed Congress for many of the burdensome regulations it has crafted, and often this blame is justified. The 104th Congress now has made itself accountable and responsible to the American public for all regulations. The Congressional Review Act, part of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, allows Congress to review each new rule and consider a joint resolution of disapproval to overrule it. Under this Act, no rule may go into effect until it is delivered to Congress for its review. A "rule" is defined very broadly to include all general agency statements that affect the public, including "interpretive" rules, agency "policy statements," "guidelines," and "staff manuals."  Federal agencies will have to report to Congress on each rule, stating whether they have evaluated the costs of the rule relative to the benefits, whether the rule takes private property, and whether it affects the relationship between the federal government and state and local governments. Congress can reject a rule, which would then have to be changed substantially before it could be resubmitted to Congress.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
More reform would have been achieved had President Clinton not vetoed other measures passed by the 104th Congress. Among them:
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

<b>The Common Sense Liability Reform Act (vetoed by President Clinton)</b> The Act would have curbed abuses of the legal system. It had strong bipartisan backing in Congress but was vigorously opposed by the trial lawyers -- incidentally, among the largest contributors to Clinton's presidential campaign. Liability reform is desperately needed to reduce the crushing burden of frivolous and unfounded cases brought against state and local governments, charitable organizations, and America's product manufacturers. Unfortunately, Congress did not have the votes necessary to override Clinton's veto of May 2, 1996.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>The Comprehensive Regulatory Reform Act of 1995 (vetoed by President Clinton)</b> In September 1993, President Clinton had revised and reissued the regulatory review executive order first issued by President Reagan. Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review, established a set of principles to guide federal regulators in developing rules and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in reviewing rules. These principles include consideration of costs and benefits and the use of market-based alternatives and performance standards. The Clinton Administration, however, did not appear very committed to making sure the regulatory principles it embodied were being taken into consideration by federal agencies. A review of EPA rulemaking between April 1994 and September 1994 showed that:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Of 45 significant rules reviewed by OMB, only six contained a determination that the benefits justified the costs; only three contained a determination of a compelling public need; and only nine considered alternative approaches to regulating. Of the other 177 EPA rules issued during that six-month period but not reviewed by OMB, no rule determined that the benefits justified the costs.<sup>23</sup>
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The 104th Congress recognized that for regulatory reform to be truly effective, it must force regulatory agencies to behave differently, and a statutory change was the only way to achieve it. Federal regulators needed to be required to base their decisions on costs, benefits, and actual risks faced by Americans, and they need Congress to give them the roadmap to do it. Congress enacted such legislation as part of a temporary increase in the debt ceiling. But President Clinton vetoed this bill on November 13, 1995.

<p>

<b>THE BAND-AID APPROACH: THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S "REGULATORY REINVENTION INITIATIVES" </b>
<p><blockquote>
<center>	I am going to stop handing down mandates to you and regulating you to death.</center>

<P>
--Bill Clinton, remarks before the U.S. Conference of Mayors, Houston, Texas, June 22, 1992.
</blockquote><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Despite campaign promises to cut red tape, the growth of regulation has continued during the Clinton Administration.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
At the end of 1992, the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), the annual accumulation of all federal regulations in effect, filled 199 volumes and 128,344 pages. By the end of 1995, the CFR had grown to 205 volumes and 138,186 pages -- almost 10,000 pages of new executive branch rules in just three years.<sup>24</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
To be sure, soon after the 104th Congress took office, the Clinton Administration initiated a number of steps that made it look as if it was really serious about slowing the growth of new rules. For example, on February 21, 1995, the White House directed federal agencies to conduct a review of their existing regulations to determine which should be eliminated and which should be streamlined, updated, overhauled, or otherwise improved.<sup>25</sup>  However, one year later, it is clear the Administration is making no real progress in reducing the overall burden of regulation. For example:
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In June 1995, the Administration claimed that agencies had identified over 16,000 pages in the Code of Federal Regulations that they would be eliminating.<sup>26</sup>  But some of the pages being eliminated are for rules for which the underlying statute has long since been repealed, treaties that no longer exist, and the like. This alone easily could achieve a 10 percent reduction in the CFR without accomplishing any real changes in the way the federal government goes about regulating the public. So while it sounds impressive, it is not. At the same time, the Administration already has added 10,000 pages of new regulations.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
While EPA claims to be streamlining various permitting, review, and reporting requirements for a number of programs, the Clinton Administration simultaneously is pushing forward with burdensome regulatory initiatives, such as expanding the universe of sources that must be reported as part of the Toxic Release Inventory. Critics argue that last year's expansion will mean as much as $331 million in compliance costs.<sup>27</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The Administration, while asserting that it is committed to sound science, is pursuing federal guidelines on cancer assessment to make it easier to regulate or ban substances despite the lack of sound scientific evidence that they pose any risk. Virtually all scientists who conduct statistical analyses to determine cancer risks -- or any other analyses, for that matter -- use confidence levels to determine the likelihood that their results are accurate. But the EPA proposed new rules this April that would eliminate the current requirement that EPA use confidence levels in doing risk assessments. Under this new rule, EPA would be able to conclude that something is dangerous on the basis of evidence that would fail under any rigorous scientific study.<sup>28</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Although the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is consolidating a few rules and eliminating duplicative pages in the Code of Federal Regulations, it also is working on new regulations that will impose over $12 billion in compliance costs on consumers and businesses (indoor air quality and ergonomics) and increase the cost of a home by $1,000 to $5,000 (fall protection).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Clearly, the Clinton Administration's "reinvention" effort does little to curb the rising costs and inefficiencies of regulation. The Administration claims to be reinventing regulation but goes about implementing new burdensome regulations about as fast as it can take old ones off the books.
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
When the 104th Congress began in January 1995, the federal government's ever-expanding reach into the lives of Americans -- the food they eat, how they use their private property, how they run their businesses -- was a source of great concern to the American people. The 104th Congress has made historic progress toward fundamentally changing how the federal government regulates the lives of all Americans. And it has done so by applying a set of principles: free markets, competition, consideration of costs and benefits, sound science and risk assessment, priority setting, and assigning of property rights.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The Clinton Administration will now attempt to take credit for regulatory reform through its "reinvention" efforts, but all it actually has done is try to play "catch-up" by repackaging the same old regulatory system and passing it off as something new. Making it easier for businesses to comply with regulations that were unjustified in the first place or claiming to take away rules while simultaneously adding new ones does not represent true regulatory reform. The American people are too smart for that. In the final analysis, they know that true reform gives them more freedom and incentives to take actions for their own benefit, and that the 104th Congress has delivered on its promise in a way that will affect the shape of federal regulations for decades.

A Special Report to the House Banking and Financial Services Committee
<P>


<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
The Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 requires a number of government agencies--the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the General Accounting Office (GAO), the Department of the Treasury, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)--to report on the feasibility and effects of privatizing the two largest housing-related government sponsored enterprises (GSEs): the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac).
<p>

As these reports are being submitted to Congress,<sup>1</sup> the House subcommittee on Capital Markets, Securities and Government Sponsored Enterprises is holding oversight hearings to study the issue of privatizing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The hearings have highlighted the diverse opinions of the federal agencies on the advantages and disadvantages of privatization. Several of the academic studies and the Congressional Budget Office report indicate that federal sponsorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac provides stockholders with a significant subsidy that may indicate government sponsorship is unnecessary. On the other hand, the Department of the Treasury and the Department of Housing and Urban Development both conclude that government sponsorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac continues to be necessary to preserve the mission and ensure the success of these GSEs.


<p>
Because of the divergent views among government agencies and outside experts on privatization, some observers are arguing that, even if the GSEs are not privatized, congressional oversight is inappropriate because Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are legally private corporations and not government agencies. Thus, Congress now finds itself defending its oversight role as well as considering the option of privatization.
<p>

Although Congress will hear many different views on these issues, it must keep in mind  two important facts to help guide its decisions:
<ol>

<p><li><b>Congress is ultimately responsible for safeguarding the interests of taxpayers.</b> Congressional oversight of government sponsored enterprises is not only appropriate but indeed critical as long as GSEs like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac receive government subsidies, undertake a public mission, and place taxpayers at risk.

<p><li><b>The original mission of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, establishing an efficient secondary mortgage market, has been fulfilled.</b> Thus, Congress should take steps to end the relationship between these organizations and the federal government.
</ol><p>
<b>Congressional Oversight of GSEs Is Critical As Long As 
Taxpayers Are At Risk</b>
<p>

The structure and mission of government sponsored enterprises (GSEs) makes their relationship to the federal government and role in the economy ambiguous and at times risky. GSEs typically are stockholder-owned corporations, and therefore private, but chartered and overseen by the federal government, and therefore public. This dual personality can create a conflict between a GSE executive who is responsible for maximizing profit for the corporation's stockholders and the federal official whose duty is to ensure that the public mission of the corporation is met.
<p>

Because GSEs are private organizations responsible to their stockholders, they may view congressional oversight and investigations as intrusions into the internal affairs of their private business. At the same time, none of the GSEs want to lose the special privileges afforded them by federal charter and implicit government guarantees. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are active across the country and easily can mobilize broad-based support within Congress for favorable treatment. This is especially true when the topic of discussion is privatization.
<p>

However, there are several reasons why congressional oversight and investigation is important and necessary as long as GSEs remain under the umbrella of taxpayer support and protection. These include: 
<ul>
<p><li><b>The GSEs were chartered by Congress to fulfill a specific public policy goal.</b> In exchange for the government support enjoyed by GSEs--such as exemption from state and local taxes, the ability to borrow money from the federal treasury, and participation in Federal Reserve Open Market transactions--these private organizations are expected to fulfill a specific public policy goal. In the case of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, this goal is to make home mortgages more readily available by creating an efficient and fluid secondary mortgage market. Although this mission has been met, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac continue to receive significant benefits from the federal government. It is necessary, therefore, to ensure that the GSEs do not use these benefits to stray from their original charters.

<p><li><b>The federal oversight agency can have conflicting roles as regulator and advocate, putting taxpayers at risk.</b>The Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 created the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) to oversee the activities of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Specifically, the OFHEO is required to establish minimal risk-based capital standards to be met by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These requirements limit the potential risk faced by taxpayers in the case of a serious failure. However, the risk-based capital requirements also have the effect of limiting the profitability of the GSEs by restricting the amount of productive investments that can be made at any one time. Therefore, the goals of advocacy and regulation can be in direct conflict. If the OFHEO chooses to lean toward advocacy rather than regulation, then taxpayer risk could increase.<sup>2</sup>  The Congressional Budget Office reports that "OFHEO's objective of minimizing risk is inconsistent with the current objective of using the GSEs to finance the achievement of social goals."<sup>3</sup> Thus, Congress also must oversee the activities of the OFHEO.

<p><li><b>Congress is ultimately responsible for avoiding a GSE failure that potentially could cost taxpayers billions of dollars.</b> Congress is responsible for protecting the interests of the American taxpayers. Taxpayers have a large vested interest in government sponsored enterprises and it is incumbent upon Congress to ensure that this interest is carefully protected.
</ul><p>
<b>Privatizing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac</b>
<p>

Privatization of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would have a number of important economic benefits. In the short-term, the loss of an implicit government guarantee would increase the cost of business for GSEs, and it is likely that part of this increase would be passed on to consumers in the form of higher mortgage interest costs. In the long-run, however, the end of Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's implicit government guarantee would create a more competitive secondary mortgage market. Increased competition would counter the loss of federal subsidies and help to keep mortgage costs down. Competition also would lead to greater innovation and hence more consumer choice. In addition, privatization would mean an end to taxpayer support and the mandate to achieve certain public policy objectives. Thus, the federal government's oversight role would end, and the GSEs would be free to exit existing lines of business and enter more profitable ones. 
<p>

Several important factors make privatization a viable and attractive option. These include:
<ul>
<p><li><b>Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have fulfilled their original mission; secondary mortgage markets are established and fluid.</b> There is a consensus that the secondary mortgage market in America is well established and fluid. In fact, each of the four studies mandated by the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 concludes that an efficient secondary mortgage market exists today (see box). Along with other private firms, they would able to take advantage of the established market without posing a threat to taxpayers. </ul>

<tr><td><b>BY ALL ACCOUNTS, TODAY'S SECONDARY MORTGAGE MARKET IS ESTABLISHED AND FLUID</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>"The secondary market now provides an efficient, stable, and dependable source of liquidity for mortgage credit markets."<sup>4</sup> - <I>U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development</I><p>

"Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have succeeded in developing a liquid secondary mortgage market for conforming, conventional mortgages. ... There seems little doubt that securitization and the secondary mortgage activities pioneered by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac are now well-established and that the secondary market for conforming, conventional mortgages could operate efficiently and effectively even if Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's government sponsorship were altered."<sup>5</sup> -  <I>U.S. Department of the Treasury</I>
<p>
 "Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have played critical roles in establishing and maintaining a nationwide secondary mortgage market, enhancing the affordability and availability of housing finance, and increasing efficiency through greater standardization of mortgage products and processes."<sup>6</sup> - <I>General Accounting Office</I>
<p>
"From a perspective of financing mortgages, the good news is that access to mortgage funds has increased."<sup>7</sup> - <I>Congressional Budget Office</I>
</td></tr></table>
<ul><p>

<p><li><b>There is no rationale for further government intervention in the mortgage credit markets.</b> Fannie Mae was created in 1938 in an attempt to increase the availability of affordable home mortgages. At that time, technological shortcomings and a Depression-era private economy prevented the widespread availability of home mortgages. Even in 1970, when Freddie Mac was chartered, an efficient secondary market was an illusive goal. However, today technology and more fluid capital markets have increased the availability of mortgages to all potential home buyers. 
<p>
Indeed, the development and efficiency of the home mortgage markets in America is, at least in part, a credit to the activities of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. After having met their original goals, however, these GSEs are now involved in activities that relate only tangentially to their original missions. The Congressional Budget Office reports, "Having achieved their original purpose, the housing GSEs can now cite the authority to undertake a large number of tasks whose precise nature is not always clearly defined."<sup>8</sup>  The expansion of activities undertaken by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac indicates that they have fulfilled their original public policy mission. These expanded activities also pose new risks to the taxpayers.
<p>

<li><b>The tremendous size of the housing GSEs, which is made possible only by implicit federal guarantee,  presents a dangerous presence in the capital markets.</b> Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac together have more than $1.4 trillion in debt and mortgage-backed securities. This is equivalent to nearly two-fifths of the publicly held federal government debt.<sup>9</sup>  Together the two housing GSEs purchase more than 50 percent of all conforming mortgages.<sup>10</sup>  By any measure, then, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are "800-pound gorillas" in the capital markets. This tremendous size is made possible only by the distinct advantages enjoyed by the organizations as government sponsored enterprises.
<p>
The advantages enjoyed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and their enormous size present several dangers to the credit markets in general and the mortgage markets specifically. Private firms cannot compete with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.<sup>11</sup> The federal government, in essence, has created a duopoly that hinders innovation and prevents consumers from obtaining the most efficient delivery of home mortgages. Moreover, in the case of a GSE failure, the mortgage credit market would be severely crippled because of the lack of participants able to fill the void left by such a primary participant.
<p>
In addition, the large number of transactions carried out by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have significant effects on other credit markets. Demand for mortgages is abnormally high because Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are able to borrow money in the credit markets at a subsidized rate. This subsidy is partially passed on to consumers, who will forego other investment activities when faced with a lower mortgage price. In fact, residential structures today represent nearly 30 percent of total tangible wealth in the United States. This figure has slowly been rising over the past two decades. Government distortion of the capital markets means that natural demands within other sectors--such as small business loans, consumer loans, and farm loans--are not being fully met. This distortion may have a long-term impact on the strength of the American economy as more capital is diverted away from productive business activities and into home ownership.
<p>
<p><li><b>The mixed private/public nature of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac constitutes a conflict of interest.</b> Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are stockholder-owned companies. As such, they are responsible for earning the highest possible profits for their shareholders. In the private market this would be completely acceptable. However, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are accountable for meeting several public goals that may conflict with their private incentive to earn a maximum profit. If Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac vigorously pursue their private goals, then the public mission is lost and taxpayers are placed in jeopardy. On the other hand, stockholders are denied a maximum rate of return if Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac pursue their public missions too vigorously. This conflict between public and private interests will continue as long as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac remain government sponsored, but structurally private, enterprises.
<p>
Fannie Mae admits that the value of its stock depends largely on federal government subsidies. Responding to one of the five academic studies prepared for Congress, Fannie Mae writes, "[I]f shareholders are not compensated fully, they will likely claim that privatization constitutes an appropriation of private property without just compensation in violation of the Due Process or the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment."<sup>12</sup> Thus, even Fannie Mae recognizes that the current structure of the housing GSEs constitutes a transfer of wealth from the entire pool of taxpayers to the relatively small number of GSE stockholders. As in all areas of government, such a transfer is highly suspect.
</ul><p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
The reports mandated by the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act and the current congressional hearings represent a positive step in addressing the need for and appropriateness of federal interference in the financial markets. Congress has a responsibility to oversee the ongoing activities of all GSEs, including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as long as American taxpayers provide support and assume risk for GSE activities.
<p>

With their original goal of a comprehensive and fluid secondary mortgage market fulfilled, however, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac no longer require government support. Increasingly, housing GSEs are venturing into new areas of operation that pose a significant threat to taxpayers. With the job done, Congress should break the links between Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the federal government and completely turn these profitable operations over to the private sector.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

One of the most important fiscal policy debates developing in this election involves the question of whether changes in tax policy have "supply-side" effects. In other words, will lower tax rates increase economic growth, resulting in more jobs, higher wages, and bigger profits?  If the answer is yes -- meaning that lower tax rates cause taxable income to rise -- it is reasonable to argue that a tax cut will be at least partially self-financing. The extent to which increased revenue from a bigger tax base helps offset the revenue loss from lower tax rates then becomes an empirical question. This is what "static" versus "dynamic" scoring is all about. Static analysis assumes that tax changes have no impact on economic growth, meaning no increases in revenue; dynamic analysis recognizes that taxes do affect the economy. Unfortunately, government estimators use a static approach.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The battle over revenue-estimating methodology may seem an esoteric, inside-the-Beltway issue, but it has important implications. Politicians generally favor tax cuts, but they do not relish voting for higher deficits and certainly are loathe to approve offsetting savings from the spending side of the budget. Dynamic scoring, assuming it is used properly, can facilitate sound tax policy by reducing the politically "unpleasant" side-effects of tax cuts.<sup>1</sup>  In the short term, a proper understanding of the importance of dynamic scoring would make it easier either to repeal the 1990 and 1993 tax hikes or to provide an across-the-board reduction in tax rates.<sup>2</sup>  In the long term, the move to a flat tax would be expedited if dynamic scoring were used to allow the lowest possible rate.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Because dynamic scoring would make tax rate reductions more attractive, it is understandable that those who oppose tax cuts want to maintain the current system of static scoring. An objective examination of the historical evidence, however, demonstrates that dynamic scoring gives policymakers more accurate information.<sup>3</sup>  When taking steps to modernize the revenue-estimating process, policymakers should consider the following points:<ul><p><li><b>Learn from history.</b> Static scoring routinely overestimates how much revenue will be generated by tax increases. The 1990 luxury tax, the income tax rate increases of 1990 and 1993, and the 1986 capital gains tax rate increase are all examples in which revenues fell far short of static predictions. By contrast, the 1981 Reagan tax cuts, the 1978 capital gains tax reduction, the Kennedy tax cuts of the 1960s, and the 1986 Tax Reform Act all demonstrate how pro-growth tax changes will generate revenue feedback.<sup>4</sup><p><li><b>Don't make the perfect the enemy of the good.</b> It is impossible to predict all the effects of any single change in government policy. The fact that dynamic scoring cannot pinpoint all the multiyear effects of a change in tax policy, however, is not an argument for maintaining a static process guaranteed to give an answer that is wrong and farther from the truth.

<P><LI><B>Not all tax cuts are created equal.</b> The higher the tax rate, the bigger the supply-side response when the rate is reduced. Likewise, reducing tax rates on capital income, which is more easily controlled by the taxpayer, will have a greater impact than similar tax reductions on labor income. And some tax cuts, such as credits, will have little or no revenue feedback effects since incentives to engage in productive behavior remain unchanged.<sup>5</sup><p><li><b>Open the process to public scrutiny.</b> Even though they are the ones who pay the bills, taxpayers today are not allowed to examine the static models and methodology used by revenue estimators at the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Treasury Department. Whether or not the revenue-estimating process is improved, policymakers should insist on full disclosure. If policymakers adopt dynamic scoring, an open process will keep the system honest by inhibiting those who are tempted to exaggerate the benefits of tax cuts.

<p><li><b>The goal of tax policy is to maximize growth, not tax revenues.</b> For years, budget deficits have played a big role in the political debate. As a result, some tax policy proposals, such as reductions in the capital gains tax, are judged primarily by their effect on tax collections. This myopic approach inevitably interferes with sound tax policy and should be discarded.

<p><li><b>Include estimates of private and governmental compliance costs.</b> According to the Tax Foundation, the current tax system imposes $225 billion in compliance costs on the productive sector of the economy.<sup>6</sup>  In addition to these private costs of lawyers, lobbyists, accountants, tax preparers, and lost man-hours, about $13 billion in direct government expenditures is associated with taxation.<sup>7</sup>  Yet revenue estimators confess that "staff does not estimate the administrative costs incurred by either the IRS or taxpayers that may result from proposed legislation."<sup>8</sup></ul><p><b>WHAT IS STATIC SCORING, AND WHO DOES IT?</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There are two official sources of revenue estimates in Washington. The Administration uses the Office of Tax Analysis (OTA), which is part of the Treasury Department, and Congress uses the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT). Both use static scoring, though it is important to define the term.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Static scoring does not mean there is absolutely no recognition that taxpayers might modify their behavior in response to changes in tax policy. Defenders of the status quo thus argue that dynamic effects are incorporated into revenue forecasts. To a limited extent, they are right.<sup>9</sup>  If asked to estimate the revenue impact of a change in the gasoline tax, for instance, the current process attempts to measure the degree to which the change in the tax will affect the amount of gasoline purchased. Likewise, changes in income tax rates will include some calculation of tax avoidance behavior.<sup>10</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Missing from the equation, however, is any effort to capture the revenue effects caused by changes in macroeconomic variables. Revenue estimators assume that economic growth, job creation, and income will remain unchanged, regardless of how much taxes are reduced or increased. The Treasury Department's Office of Tax Analysis, for example, in a 1995 analysis of the flat tax wrote that:
<blockquote>
	no attempt is made to estimate the tax-induced behavioral responses of either individuals or corporations. Following the standard revenue estimating conventions used by both the Office of Tax Analysis and the Joint Committee on Taxation, the macroeconomic aggregates, such as the level of compensation, prices, employment, and gross domestic product, have been assumed to be unchanged by the proposal.<sup>11</sup></blockquote><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These assumptions effectively require the Treasury Department and the Joint Committee on Taxation to ignore the real world. This may be a reasonable approach for minor alterations of the tax code,<sup>12</sup> but it certainly produces inaccurate answers when examining significant changes. Thus, if asked to predict what would happen if tax rates were doubled, for instance, revenue estimators would assume that tax collections, with some minor modifications, would double as well. Some may think this is an exaggeration, but consider the actions of the Joint Committee on Taxation. In 1988, Senator Robert Packwood (R-OR), ranking Republican on the Finance Committee, asked the JCT to estimate the revenue impact if the government confiscated all income over $200,000 annually.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The revenue estimators at JCT responded that such a tax would raise $104 billion the first year, $204 billion the second year, $232 billion the third year, and $263 billion and $299 billion in the fourth and fifth years, respectively.<sup>13</sup>  As Senator Packwood noted, however, this view of the world is impractical because it "assumes people will work if they have to pay all their money to the Government. They will work forever and pay all of the money to the Government when clearly anyone in their right mind will not."<sup>14</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To be fair, the revenue estimators are not really the ones at fault.<sup>15</sup>  The decision to modernize and improve the scoring process will have to come from the top. At the Office of Tax Analysis, presidentially appointed officials at the Treasury Department are the only ones with the power to authorize this change. On Capitol Hill, this power lies with the Members of Congress who serve on the Joint Committee on Taxation, particularly the Chairman and Vice-Chairman. Indeed, the JCT has set up a Revenue Estimating Advisory Board to explore "ways to improve the estimating process and estimating methodology."<sup>16</sup><p><b>WHAT IS DYNAMIC SCORING?</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In simple terms, dynamic scoring means that estimates would be designed to capture revenue effects from changes in overall economic conditions. Instead of deliberately ignoring these variables, as is the convention today, revenue estimators would predict whether a change in policy would be likely to affect the level of compensation, prices, employment, and gross domestic product (GDP). If there is an effect on one or more of these variables, they would then calculate the amount of revenue feedback or loss.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

How would this work?  Take the example of the 15 percent across-the-board tax cut proposed some weeks ago by Senator Spencer Abraham (R-MI). Static revenue estimates reportedly show this proposal reducing tax revenues by about $500 billion over a six-year period.<sup>17</sup>  If such a proposal boosted the economy's rate of growth by one-half of one percentage point over the same period, however, Congressional Budget Office sensitivity tables (designed to measure the effects of selected economic changes on budget projections) indicate that $170 billion of that loss would be recouped in the form of revenue feedback and lower interest costs. Administration figures show the feedback would be more than $200 billion.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

As shown in <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1090t1.gif">Table 1</a>, both the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) agree that faster growth helps reduce the budget deficit. These numbers work both ways, incidentally, with slower growth boosting the budget deficit. The key questions are whether a change in tax policy will promote growth and, if so, by how much.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Contrary to popular wisdom, dynamic scoring does not mean that tax cuts pay for themselves. The degree of revenue feedback depends on what tax rate is being reduced and by what amount. Only in extremely rare circumstances is it believed that a tax rate reduction will generate enough economic activity to offset all of the revenue loss associated with the lower rate.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

<a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1090c1.gif">Chart 1</a>, popularly known as the Laffer curve, illustrates this principle. A zero rate tax will stimulate considerable growth but, by definition, collects no revenue. A 100 percent tax rate also generates no revenue, however, because it eliminates all incentive to earn income -- not to mention what happens to the rest of the economy. What happens, though, if the government imposes a tax rate of, say, 10 percent?  With a low, flat rate, almost all taxpayers presumably will continue to work, so the government will collect one-tenth of the income earned. As tax rates rise, however, taxpayers gradually become discouraged and reduce their earnings. As long as tax rates are not excessive, the increase in revenue associated with the higher tax rate exceeds the revenue loss caused by lower levels of income. At some point, however, the tax rate reaches a revenue-maximizing level. Any efforts to raise tax rates beyond this level will reduce revenues because of the fall in taxable income.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Tragically, there are some taxes in America that fall on the wrong side of the Laffer curve. These include:<ul>

<p><li><b>Income tax rates on the rich.</b> Wealthy taxpayers are particularly sensitive to high tax rates. Not only can they afford the best tax lawyers, accountants, and financial planners, but they also receive most of their income in the form of dividends, interest, capital gains, and other business income (see <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1090c2.gif">Chart 2</a>). When tax rates become too onerous, these taxpayers can shift their assets to tax-free status, move their money offshore, or take other steps to alter the timing or composition of their income.<sup>18</sup>  According to recent research by James Poterba of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, lower tax rates on the richest 0.5 percent would generate higher rather than lower tax revenues.<sup>19</sup>

<p><li><b>Estate taxes.</b> The government confiscates 55 percent of a person's assets in excess of $4 million upon death.<sup>20</sup>  Those smart enough to build up businesses and portfolios of this value, however, typically are also smart enough to protect their families' wealth from the government.<sup>21</sup>  Thus, even though the estate tax collects about $15 billion annually, it is estimated that the government loses money because of reduced income tax collections caused by aggressive estate planning (which occurs in the years prior to death when wealthy taxpayers transfer funds, cease working, set up trusts, give to charity, and take other steps to reduce the tax value of their assets).<sup>22</sup><p><li><b>Capital gains taxes.</b> Revenue estimators from both Congress and the Administration acknowledge that lower capital gains taxes will boost sales (or realizations) of stock, bonds, real estate, and other assets. This "unlocking effect," by itself, may be large enough to produce a net revenue increase.<sup>23</sup>  Unfortunately, both the JCT and the OTA fail to calculate the impact of lower capital gains taxes on economic growth. If the revenue estimates included the effects of higher growth, they almost surely would show a significant revenue gain.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Tax rates that are so punitive that they actually lose revenue certainly should be reduced. The lower rate would please conservatives who favor economic growth, and should please liberals who want the government to collect more money.<sup>24</sup>  It is important to recognize, however, that there is a huge difference between the revenue-maximizing tax rate and the growth-maximizing tax rate. Largely because of hefty value-added taxes (a form of national sales tax), many countries in Europe take a much higher percentage of their citizens' money than America does.<sup>25</sup>  These nations may be near the revenue-maximizing point of the Laffer curve, but it comes at a heavy price. European countries, compared to the United States, suffer from higher unemployment, slower growth, larger budget deficits, and lower incomes.
</ol>
<p>

<b>HISTORICAL EXAMPLES</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The strong theoretical argument for dynamic scoring is augmented by a great deal of historical evidence. The United States has experienced significant shifts in tax policy over the years, and the historical record both demonstrates the shortcomings of static analysis and provides ample proof that the revenue-estimating process should be modernized.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Before looking at specific examples, however, it may be useful to look at the broad picture. As <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1090c3.gif">Chart 3</a> illustrates, tax revenues traditionally have consumed about 19 percent of America's economic output.<sup>26</sup>  This relationship has been remarkably stable even though tax rates have shifted by large amounts. At times, the top income tax rate has exceeded 90 percent, while at other times it has fallen to less than 30 percent. The chart also shows income tax collections as a percentage of GDP. As is the case with total tax revenues, income tax collections are remarkably stable, hovering between 8 percent and 9 percent. The only two times they reached 9.4 percent or more, in 1969 and 1981, the economy fell into recession.<sup>27</sup><p><b>The Tax Cuts of the 1920s.</b> Tax rates were slashed dramatically during the 1920s, falling from 73 percent to 24 percent.<sup>28</sup>  The economy boomed, growing at an average annual rate of 6 percent between 1921 and 1929.<sup>29</sup>  Personal income tax revenues increased substantially, rising from $719 million in 1921 to $1,160 million in 1928.<sup>30</sup>  This 61 percent increase in revenue occurred at a time of no inflation. As <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1090c4.gif">Chart 4</a> shows, the percentage of the tax burden borne by the rich jumped dramatically, climbing from 44.2 percent in 1921 to 78.4 percent in 1928. These results, not surprisingly, would not have been predicted by static analysis.<p><b>The Kennedy Tax Cuts.</b> Lower taxes on savings and investment were approved in 1962, followed by across-the-board tax rate reductions in 1964. Economic growth picked up, with GDP increasing at an average annual rate of 5 percent between 1961 and 1968.<sup>31</sup>  The Kennedy tax cuts triggered the longest expansion in America's history, and revenues grew by 62 percent over the seven-year period.<sup>32</sup>  One of the most compelling pieces of supply-side evidence is the way different income groups responded to lower tax rates. As seen in <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1090c5.gif">Chart 5</a>, wealthy taxpayers wound up paying significantly more tax revenues after their tax rates were reduced -- exactly as dynamic forecasting would have predicted.
<p>
<b>The 1978 Capital Gains Tax Cut.</b> The more control a taxpayer has over a taxable activity, the more pronounced the supply-side effect. Capital gains taxes are the best example of this phenomenon since a taxpayer can avoid the tax by not selling assets. In 1968, legislation was approved raising the capital gains tax from 25 percent to 49 percent. (Effective tax rates almost always were higher--sometimes over 100 percent -- since the government did not, and still does not, allow taxpayers to adjust asset prices for inflation.) Not surprisingly, capital gains revenues were sluggish throughout the 1970s. In 1978, however, the rate was reduced to 28 percent.<sup>33</sup>  The very next year, revenues jumped 45 percent.<sup>34</sup>  Capital gains tax revenues continued to rise, climbing even more when the Reagan tax cuts lowered the rate even further, down to 20 percent in 1981.<p>
<b>Windfall Profits Tax.</b> During the Carter Administration, a heavy tax was imposed on crude oil. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated in 1979 that the tax would collect $184.5 billion between 1980 and 1985. But it brought in just $77.7 billion.<sup>35</sup>  To be fair, the huge revenue gap probably was due to President Reagan's decision to decontrol oil prices, something the JCT could not have predicted in 1979. At the same time, however, foreknowledge of this move may have caused the revenue estimators to make an even bigger mistake, since most liberals believed that restoring competition to the petroleum market would cause oil prices to skyrocket.<sup>36</sup><p><b>The Reagan Tax Cuts.</b> Campaigning on across-the-board tax cuts, Ronald Reagan took office at a time when the economy was in horrible shape. The economy was in the middle of a severe double-dip recession. Inflation was running at double-digit rates, unemployment was rising, and interest rates had climbed to more than 20 percent.<sup>37</sup>  Critics claimed the tax cuts would be inflationary and would do nothing to boost growth, but just the opposite happened. Americans did not receive a net tax cut until sometime between July 1982 and January 1983 because previously legislated payroll tax increases and bracket creep offset the portions of the tax cut that took effect in 1981 and 1982.<sup>38</sup>  Once the tax cuts did take effect, the longest peacetime economic expansion in the nation's history began.<sup>39</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The most comprehensive analysis of the revenue effect of the Reagan tax cuts shows two things: The lower tax rates on the rich more than paid for themselves, and there were substantial feedback effects from lower tax rates on other income classes as well (see <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1090c6.gif">Chart 6</a>). Defenders of high tax rates condemn the Reagan program, noting that tax revenues in the early 1980s were well below the Administration's original projections.<sup>40</sup>  But this reasoning is seriously flawed. First, it blames the tax cuts for the second half of the double-dip recession of 1980-1982, a drop in the economy that began before the economy received a tax cut. Second, it fails to recognize the irony that two-thirds of the revenue shortfall occurred because inflation was reduced much faster than was originally thought.<sup>41</sup>  Significantly, the forecast of the Democrat-controlled Congressional Budget Office closely matched the Administration's.<sup>42</sup><p><b>The 1986 Tax Reform Act.</b> This legislation provides one of the best examples of why dynamic forecasting is needed. The Tax Reform Act lowered tax rates on individual income and increased the tax burden on corporate income.<sup>43</sup>  According to the static estimates, the shift in taxes amounted to more than $100 billion over the five-year period. Actual tax collections, however, showed a very clear and pronounced supply-side effect. As taxpayers responded to lower rates, individual income tax revenues grew faster than expected, nearly 6 percent above projections. The higher tax burden on corporate income, meanwhile, had the opposite effect. Corporate income tax receipts were very sluggish, falling nearly 25 percent below the static estimates.<sup>44</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The divergent responses of personal and corporate income tax collections are critical. Defenders of static forecasting always try to argue that the dynamic effects are a coincidence. The booming economy and rapid revenue growth of the 1920s, 1960s, and 1980s, for instance, are said to have had nothing to do with lower tax rates. Likewise, the economy's poor performance during the 1930s, 1970s, and 1990s is said to be just bad fortune completely unrelated to higher tax rates. These arguments fall apart when analyzing the Tax Reform Act, since it is impossible to blame sluggish corporate tax collections on a weak economy while at the same time claiming that strong personal tax collections are the result of a strong economy.
<p>
<b>The 1986 Capital Gains Tax Rate Increase.</b> As part of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, policymakers increased the capital gains tax from 20 percent to 28 percent. Two noteworthy things happened. Capital gains realizations (asset sales) and revenues soared before the tax rate increase took effect and then collapsed by more than 50 percent when the higher rate took effect.<sup>45</sup>  When the Congressional Budget Office put together its revenue baseline in 1990, however, it assumed that capital gains realizations would grow at the same rate they did during the early 1980s when the tax rate was low. This proved to be a huge error. In fact, the high capital gains tax discouraged asset sales, and realizations were stagnant, usually less than half of CBO's projections.<sup>46</sup>  Moreover, the Joint Committee on Taxation used this inflated baseline in 1990 to put together static revenue estimates suggesting that a reduction in the rate would lose money and primarily benefit the wealthy. But the 1986 increase in the capital gains tax rate actually hurt middle-income taxpayers more than the rich, since the tax rate on their gains rose from 14 percent to 28 percent.<sup>47</sup><p><b>The Luxury Tax.</b> The 1990 budget agreement included provisions imposing excise taxes on products thought to be purchased by the "rich," including luxury boats and private airplanes. These taxes backfired so badly that Congress repealed them. Actual collections from the boat tax reached $32.5 million, according to the Treasury Department, far below the $53 million originally forecast.<sup>48</sup>  The Joint Committee on Taxation, meanwhile, admitted that the airplane tax collected just 10 percent of the static estimate.<sup>49</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Defenders of the tax have tried to argue that the revenue shortfall was coincidental,<sup>50</sup> but the actual effects are even worse than these numbers indicate. When boat builders lost their jobs and boatyards shut down, the federal government lost income and payroll taxes and also had to pay out unemployment benefits.<sup>51</sup>  The static estimates recognized that some people might have lost jobs as a result of the tax but assumed that those workers would immediately get jobs someplace else paying the same wage.<sup>52</sup>  Life in the real world, unfortunately, does not operate as flawlessly as these static blackboard models.<p><b>The Bush Tax Rate Increase.</b> In 1990, President Bush reneged on his no-new-taxes promise and signed into law a major tax increase, including an increase in the top rate from 28 percent to 31 percent. Rather than bring in new revenues, however, the government began to collect less revenue than was projected before tax rates were increased.<sup>53</sup>  In 1991 alone, revenues fell by more than $6 for every $1 the tax increase was supposed to generate.<sup>54</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Defenders of static scoring admit this happened but blame the stagnant economy for the drop in revenues. Since the tax increase certainly helped throw the economy into the tank, however, this excuse rings hollow. Even if one accepts the unlikely assumption that the tax increase had nothing to do with the recession, there are other compelling numbers showing the dynamic effect. In 1991, income tax receipts from those making more than $200,000 fell by more than 6 percent.<sup>55</sup>  Yet tax collections from those making less than that rose by 1 percent. In other words, the government wound up collecting less in revenue from the taxpayers who were slapped with higher tax rates, but collecting more from those whose taxes did not go up.
<p>
<b>The 1993 Clinton Tax Rate Increase.</b> Without a vote to spare in either the House or the Senate, President Clinton during his first year in office imposed the largest tax increase in history. His increase in tax rates, from 31 percent to 39.6 percent,<sup>56</sup> was the biggest jump since Herbert Hoover boosted the rate from 25 percent to 63 percent in 1930. Harvard economist Martin Feldstein estimates that the tax rate increase raised only one-third of the promised revenue.<sup>57</sup>  The combined effect of the Bush and Clinton tax rate increases has been an utter failure. As shown in <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1090c7.gif">Chart 7</a>, revenues from the personal income tax actually have declined as a percentage of economic output since Reagan left office.<sup>58</sup><p><b>REVENUE ESTIMATES AND THE FLAT TAX</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The perils and pitfalls of static forecasting are clearly evident in the flat tax debate. Representative Richard Armey (R-TX) resuscitated the idea of moving to a simple and fair one-rate tax system in 1994. Almost immediately, the proposal was attacked by the Administration. Shortly before the mid-term elections that year, the press reported a Treasury Department estimate that the flat tax would require a rate of 25.8 percent to be revenue neutral.<sup>59</sup>  Six months later, the Administration criticized the flat tax yet again, but this time charged that the rate would have to be 22.9 percent to avoid increasing the deficit.<sup>60</sup>  More recently, the Treasury Department issued its third static estimate of the flat tax, this time claiming that the revenue neutral rate would be 20.8 percent.<sup>61</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Clinton Administration's inability to settle on a single rate is instructive for two reasons. It demonstrates that even static revenue estimates, which involve more simplistic calculations, are far from exact. Even more important, the White House inadvertently has provided compelling evidence for the flat tax. The Treasury Department's most recent estimate, predicting a revenue neutral rate of 20.8 percent, is still exaggerated.<sup>62</sup>  But it confirms that Representative Armey's 20 percent flat tax, which includes $40 billion in budgetary savings,<sup>63</sup> is deficit-neutral -- even using static analysis.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Not surprisingly, dynamic estimates of the flat tax, using more sophisticated econometric and modeling techniques, find that growth increases significantly. This additional growth, as illustrated earlier, results in substantial revenue increases. An important question, of course, is who benefits from the economy's expansion. Representative Armey and Senate co-sponsor Richard Shelby (R-AL) believe that taxpayers should reap the benefit of faster growth. As a result, they reduce the flat rate to 17 percent in the third year.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Numerous studies support the contention that the economy will expand dramatically if the existing tax code is replaced by a single-rate flat tax. For example:<UL>

<p><li>Professor Dale Jorgenson, Chairman of the Economics Department at Harvard, testified before the National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform that a single-rate system could boost the economy by 15 percent or more within a decade.<sup>64</sup><p><li>University of California professor Alan Auerbach, formerly an economist with the Joint Committee on Taxation, estimates that the economy would be 5.7 percent larger within five years with a flat tax.<sup>65</sup><p><li>Stanford University economist Michael Boskin, a former Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, has testified that a flat tax would boost growth by 10 percent within ten years.<sup>66</sup><p><li>Even without growth effects, two former Treasury Department economists estimate that a flat tax would be revenue neutral at 17 percent.<sup>67</sup><p><li>Boston University economist Laurence J. Kotlikoff estimates that a move to a single-rate tax that does not double-tax capital income would raise living standards by between 7 percent and 14 percent.<sup>68</sup><p><li>A study by two academic economists found that a 17 percent flat tax would boost growth so much that tax revenues would increase by 1.8 percentage points.<sup>69</sup></ul><p><b>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT DYNAMIC SCORING</b><p><b><i>Q: Will lower tax rates reduce the underground economy, and will dynamic forecasting reflect this shift?</i><p>A:</b> Yes, but probably not enough to affect revenue forecasts. By definition, measuring the size of the underground economy is difficult. Those that have tried have produced estimates ranging from a low of 5 percent of GDP to a high of more than 25 percent of GDP.<sup>70</sup>  An added problem is that no one knows how much of the underground economy exists for the purpose of evading taxes. It is safe to assume that most drug dealers, bookies, and prostitutes do not pay taxes, but that will not change if tax rates are lowered. For activities that are legal, however, lower tax rates would reduce tax evasion. The American Bar Association conducted a three-year study which concluded that lower tax rates encourage greater compliance.<sup>71</sup><p><b><i>Q: What safeguards would be needed to ensure that the party in power did not abuse dynamic forecasts?</i><p>A:</b> This is a legitimate concern. Politicians often exaggerate the benefits of legislation they support, and it does not take a wild imagination to envision revenue estimators pressured to produce excessively optimistic numbers. The Congressional Budget Office, for instance, was often accused of tailoring its figures to help the Democrats when they were in the majority.<sup>72</sup>  This is why public disclosure of the model and methodology is so important. If outside experts were allowed to review all decisions, the potential for mischief would shrink dramatically.<sup>73</sup><p><b><i>Q: Should there be dynamic forecasts of spending legislation?</i><p>A:</b> If the scientific evidence is clear, the answer is yes. Considerable research has been done to show that government spending, particularly for consumption items, is a drag on economic growth.<sup>74</sup><p>Incorporating this new research into budget analysis would help policymakers make proper decisions. As with dynamic scoring of tax legislation, full disclosure is critical. The Congressional Budget Office, for instance, used a version of dynamic scoring during the debate over the 1995 Balanced Budget Act. Unfortunately, in predicting dramatic reductions in interest rates following enactment of legislation to reduce budget deficits,<sup>75</sup> the CBO was almost surely wrong.<sup>76</sup>  If the CBO had to publish its analyses and defend them before outside experts, estimators would be forced to refine and improve their techniques.<p><b>CONCLUSION</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;During the post-Reagan years, the economy has experienced its worst seven-year performance since the end of World War II.<sup>77</sup>  The average family has lost more than $2,000 of real purchasing power,<sup>78</sup> and there is little reason for optimism about the future. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that economic growth over the next ten years will average only 2.1 percent if current tax and spending policies are maintained.<sup>79</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;America can do better. From the end of World War II until the end of the Reagan years, the economy's growth rate averaged well over 3 percent -- and that includes recession years.<sup>80</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To get America growing again, tax policy will have to change. In the short term, immediate tax rate reductions are needed to boost growth; in the long term, the entire tax code should be replaced by a simple, flat tax. Unfortunately, these pro-growth changes will be harder to achieve if revenue estimators continue to use outdated and inaccurate static models. Dynamic revenue estimates, by contrast, would provide policymakers with more accurate information. Dynamic forecasting is based on a proper understanding of how the economy works, and history has shown this approach to be far more realistic.

<p><li>     It is conventional wisdom that voting for lower spending is bad politics. This fear may or may not be justified, but it certainly is true that lower spending is good economics. Ideally, lawmakers would want to reduce both taxes and spending as part of an overall effort to boost growth and enhance freedom.<p><li>    Harvard Professor Martin Feldstein, former Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, estimates that repeal of the higher tax rates approved in 1993 would result in a revenue loss of less than $10 billion, or less than one-third of the static estimate.

 <p><li>   When estimating the effect of higher tax rates in 1993, the JCT examined several non-macroeconomic factors, such as "shifting from investments which yield interest and dividend income, taxed at the new higher rates, into investments that provide capital appreciation, which is taxed at unchanged lower rates. Also considered were shifts from taxable to tax-exempt assets, conversion to C corporation business form, conversion of wage income into tax-deferred compensation or tax-exempt fringe benefits, and increased noncompliance and avoidance." All these factors, however, only reduced the pure static revenue loss by 7 percent over the five-year period.

When Senator Packwood made a similar request in 1994, the committee responded by reporting the amount of after-tax income over $200,000 while noting that "If the 100-percent tax rate were to be in effect for a substantial period of time, so that taxpayers would have no rational hope of avoiding or evading the 100-percent tax in the outyears by deferring income to lower rate years or using other tax avoidance or deferral plans, then in our judgment there would be a substantial reduction in income-producing activity in the economy and, thus, a significant reduction in tax receipts to the Federal government."

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congress soon will be considering major legislation that would enable poor children to attend the schools of their choice. Representatives J. C. Watts (R-OK) and James Talent (R-MO) have introduced a comprehensive legislative initiative, Saving Our Children: The American Community Renewal Act of 1996 (<a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.3467:">H.R. 3467</a>).<sup>1</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Title II, the Low Income Educational Opportunity Act of 1996, would establish an education choice scholarship program that includes both private and religious schools in "renewal communities."  Each locality would determine the value of the scholarship for poor children, but the maximum value of the scholarship would not exceed the per capita cost of educating children in a local public school. The scholarships available to poor children would have a minimum value not less than 66 percent of the per capita cost of educating children in the local public schools or the tuition normally charged by the private school. Parents would not be forbidden from using scholarships to pay for tuition in religious schools, and local authorities would not be able to discriminate against parents or children who do so. The scholarship program would be supported from existing federal funds.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Where their children go to school is a serious question for parents. President and Mrs. Clinton are willing to pay an annual tuition of more than $11,000 to send their daughter Chelsea to the exclusive Sidwell Friends School. Vice President and Mrs. Gore chose St. Albans School, a few blocks from Sidwell, for their son, as did D.C.'s Shadow Senator Jesse Jackson. The Clintons, like the Gores and many other parents among the nation's social and political elite, have made a conscious decision that the Washington, D.C., public schools, recently the subject of failed congressional reform efforts, are not good enough for their children. They also have decided that a school with religious affiliation is important.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While most Americans intuitively understand what is best for their children, public policy has made it difficult for all but the well-to-do to choose the school they prefer. Indeed, implicit in public policy is the assumption that where a child goes to school is unimportant. But the evidence is in: Where a child goes to school matters a good deal -- better a good school than a bad school.<sup>2</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
More important, the empirical evidence clearly reveals that most private schools do a better job than most public schools, particularly with poor and minority youngsters. Yet for more than a century, public policies in the United States have made it virtually impossible to provide public funds for children to attend private schools.<sup>3</sup>  In this regard, the United States stands virtually alone among the world's democracies.<sup>4</sup>  With enactment of the Watts-Talent bill, this dubious distinction would come to an end.
<p>
<b>THE CHANGING INTELLECTUAL CLIMATE</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For many years -- in the 1960s and 1970s in particular -- a body of thought developed in this country which emphasized a child's "background" characteristics, which were assumed to be paramount. Success in school was the luck of the socioeconomic draw. It made little or no difference where children went to school, whether urban or rural, north or south, east or west, public or private; what was important was what they brought to school with them.<sup>5</sup>  If they were poor and dispossessed, they probably would do poorly. If they were poor and members of a minority group, they were almost certain to do poorly. By way of contrast, advantaged youngsters from enriched backgrounds did well. That was -- and is -- the argument. That it flies in the face of experience and common sense has done nothing to temper its enthusiastic reception among policymaking elites.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The modern incarnation of this general argument emerged from both the incomplete interpretation and the substantial misinterpretation of early work by James Coleman, a nationally prominent sociological researcher, then at Johns Hopkins.<sup>6</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In research conducted under the auspices of the U.S. Office of Education (predecessor to the U.S. Department of Education), Coleman and his colleagues initially found little in the way of school effects; factors like race, income, and parental level of education were stronger than school characteristics as predictors of school performance. What did seem to make a modest difference was who you went to school with; poor black youngsters appeared to do better in integrated settings. But as any competent policy analyst knows, absence of proof is not proof of absence. Because "school effects" were elusive or hard to find and measure did not mean they did not exist.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To the contrary, if "school effects" really were only weak (or worse yet, if they did not exist at all), the whole rationale of public education would come tumbling down. Indeed, so might that of private schooling. If nothing matters, there is no point in worrying about the right way to educate children.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There was, however, a widespread desire to believe a variation of such an unlikely interpretation. Among liberals who believed in vigorous, interventionist government, the lack of "school effects" was interpreted to mean that these effects were not sufficiently robust. What was needed was "more" impact: more money for schools. If race and socioeconomic status (or SES in the jargon of sociologists) were more powerful determinants of school performance than schools themselves, the schools must be weak. Other larger, even more ambitious government programs would be in order.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Just as geography was destiny in the 19th century, SES became destiny in the 20th. The ironies in this development were many. In liberal hands, it became an argument designed to bolster the theory that the only good school is a rich school (and a rich public one at that). At the same time, it became an argument that absolves the existing school of its obligations to its students. It "blames the victim."  The school is not at fault if students do not learn. Schools have little or no effect; it all depends on the raw material.<sup>7</sup>  This sentiment is nicely encapsulated in a song ("Gee, Officer Krupke!") from Leonard Bernstein's classic <I>West Side Story</I>: "Hey, I'm depraved on accounta I'm deprived."
<p>
<b>WHY SCHOOLS MATTER</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Such conventional liberal theory is bad pedagogy and worse public policy. Indeed, it fell to James Coleman, then a professor at the University of Chicago, to reopen the argument with extraordinarily powerful research that demonstrated the strong effect of Catholic schools, particularly on poor black children.<sup>8</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This research, widely reported in 1981 when it appeared in summary form in <I>The Public Interest</I>, is as valid today as it was then. Coleman also noted the embarrassing fact, still a stark feature of today's school choice debate, that "there are many who vigorously oppose making private school attendance easier and at the same time have their own children enrolled in private school."<sup>9</sup>  Coleman set out to answer three vital questions:
<p><ol>
<b><li></b> Do private schools provide better education?
<p>
<b><li></b> If they do, what is the public policy interest in denying poor children access to them?
<p>
<b><li></b> Is it true, as opponents of public funding allege, that private schools racially segregate children?
</ol> <p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Coleman's first hurdle was methodological: how to distinguish "the effects of selection from the effects of the school itself" to control, "even to the extent of overcompensating," for selection into the schools. This he did. His academic findings are hardly surprising: "higher learning in the Catholic schools than in the public school."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The literature in this area is not restricted to Coleman's seminal work, as John Convey's 218-page <I>Catholic Schools Make a Difference</I> reveals.<sup>10</sup>  Convey reports that in a series of studies based on National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) data, Lee and Stewart "documented consistently higher scores of Catholic school students compared with public school students."  For example, the average Catholic school student in grades 4 and 8 scored significantly higher in reading and writing.<sup>11</sup>  In addition, Andrew Greeley's analysis of data from the High School and Beyond longitudinal study showed superior performance among whites, blacks, and Hispanics in Catholic school by every single category (Vocabulary, Reading, Math 1, Math 2, Science, and Writing), and Marks and Lee, writing in 1989, found higher scores in Catholic schools in grades 3, 7, and 11 among whites, blacks, and Hispanics in every single category for math, science, and reading.<sup>12</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The most imposing studies, however, are those of Coleman and his colleagues. Catholic school sophomores, for example, scored 10 percent higher in science and 12 percent higher in civics, and from 17 percent to 21 percent higher in mathematics, writing, reading, and vocabulary. Catholic school seniors also consistently outscored public high school students: 10 percent to 17 percent higher in reading, mathematics, and vocabulary, and from 3 percent lower to 7 percent higher on three tests that measure ability more than achievement.<sup>13</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The last finding strongly suggests that the explanation for higher scores lies not in some "ability" differential, but in what the schools do with what they have. Catholic schools expect much of their students, whatever their race and background, and expecting much, get much.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Although Coleman found even higher scores in non-Catholic private schools, the more important sample is Catholic schools, which are the dominant force in the non-government school market. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Coleman also was concerned with other issues, most notably the impact of choice on racial integration. Here the findings were equally unambiguous: A child is more likely to attend school with a child of another race in the private sector than in the public sector. The importance of this early finding would be hard to overstate; "suburban schools within the public sector are used as a haven to a much greater extent than in the private sector."  Counterbalancing "bright" flight to the suburbs is the behavior of students in Catholic school. Coleman's figures on dropouts are striking. Among white students in public school, 13.1 percent dropped out compared with 2.6 percent in Catholic schools; among Hispanic students, the difference was two to one (19.1 percent to 9.3 percent); and among black students, the difference was more than 3.5 to one (17.2 percent to 4.6 percent).<sup>14</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Coleman's first finding concerning school effects should have been received with rejoicing by the professional educators who had endured their share of bad press. Their magazines and journals should have featured articles on why schools make a difference. So also should the nation's civil rights leadership have reacted positively to Coleman's finding about racial integration in the private sector. Indeed, the refusal of the U.S. Supreme Court to establish "metropolitan" remedies for past cases of racial discrimination makes the Coleman finding all the more important, because private school attendance is almost never geographically based. Private schools, already better integrated than public schools, offer more fertile fields for expanded racial integration over time than do the public schools.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Such reactions, however, were rare, and the reason is not hard to fathom. Had Professor Coleman's rigorous social science work revealed stronger public than private school effects, there would have been joy in the great halls of the education establishment.<sup>15</sup>  But because one of the bastions of "good schooling" is the private sector,<sup>16</sup> public school educators could not -- would not -- accept his findings. Coleman, on the other hand, did no such disservice to the authorities who run the public schools. He followed the evidence where it led and found that all schools that exhibit similar characteristics have strong school effects. All schools, whether public or private, that exhibit the same cluster of attributes -- high expectations, a focused curriculum, good order and discipline, caring teachers, enterprising students -- have relatively robust "school effects."  What is important is that these characteristics are found more readily and more often in private schools.
<p>
<b>THE IMPACT OF SOCIAL CAPITAL</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In addition to his school effects work, Professor Coleman returned to the questions that had intrigued him originally: Even if some schools are better than others, what difference does what the student brings to school make?<sup>17</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What are the cultural and social traits that make a difference?  The potential for synergy is obvious, as are the public policy implications.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Social capital" is the cluster of skills, attitudes, and (to a lesser extent) knowledge that the student acquires in the non-school environment. Clearly, a child who is disruptive and unruly and who has only weakly developed academic interests is less likely to do well in any school, "good" or "bad," while youngsters who bring with them a love of learning, disciplined and orderly habits, and respect for themselves and other students, as well as for the teacher, are much more likely to do well, all other things being equal. These traits -- what might be called pro-academic traits -- are the product of caring and supportive communities, voluntarily created and maintained. Though they may include people who look alike, in the final analysis they are not defined by race, socioeconomic status, or ethnicity; they bridge all those gaps. They are associative communities made up of superficially similar or different people who share common values and virtues. In a school setting, to use a quaint term, they are "communities of scholarship."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Members of Congress and state and local legislators alike should recognize the public policy implications of "social capital."  The most important single thing they can do in this regard is to encourage its formation and continuance by underwriting education choice. Not only does choice permit the expression of "social capital;" it builds and reinforces the habits of mind that are essential to voluntary association -- the same habits of mind that are essential to civil society. In a school setting, choice imposes the burden of choosing; there is no escape. One must make one's bed and lie in it; no one else does it for you. School choice proposals, including the school choice component of the Watts-Talent legislation, foster democratic habits of mind that are essential to a free society.
<p>

<b>THE HIGH STAKES IN SCHOOLS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The reasons for the high quality of private schools are several and have to do largely with organization, incentives, and rewards. Most simply, voluntary association makes a difference. In the public sector, the organizational climate conspires against dedicated teachers and hard-working students; in the private sector, it encourages and rewards high levels of performance. In short, monopolies are no better in the public sector than in the private sector. They serve only the interests of the "owners," never the interests of workers or clients.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In the public sector, of course, the "owners" do not literally own the schools. Rather, they are managers and bureaucrats, and the schools are run for them, not for teachers and students. This rather unappealing picture is not restricted to the public sector; managerial capitalism also looks a good deal like this, which is why it is under fire from liberal and conservative critics alike. The Watts-Talent legislation would permit parents of poor children to "own" their own schools instead of having to submit to the bureaucracy that runs government schools.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
America's policymakers seem willing to tolerate failures and weaknesses in education that they would not tolerate in any other area of public policy. Coleman's findings are so powerful that were he dealing with any other area of public policy -- health, welfare, housing, transportation, or juvenile justice -- shifts in public policy would begin to reflect the new knowledge he contributed. But public schooling is a nearly immovable object; public schools are run for the convenience of, and at the pleasure of, their managers, not for the benefit of students and their families.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	When they debate the issue of school choice, Members of Congress should consider the "school effects" literature in terms of academic outcomes; its conclusions are wholly unsurprising. In light of their "environment," one would expect private schools to "do better."  They must if they are to survive. All parents who enroll their children in private school go through at least a two-step process.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>First</b>, they must decide to enroll their children in a non-government school and find the financial wherewithal to deliver on this decision. Almost without exception, this involves the payment of substantial tuition and fees out of pocket. Indeed, because people value what they pay for, "full-ride" scholarships are almost unknown in private elementary and secondary education. Even -- perhaps particularly -- schools like Father Clemens's Our Lady of Angels in Chicago charge at least a modest tuition.<sup>18</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Second</b>, the financial commitment families make to send their children to private school is a proxy for a personal commitment to education, the importance of which is hard to overestimate. It makes schools and their families partners in a way that the a public sector monopoly can never hope to achieve.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Probably the most important "school effects" issue is not the measured academic "outcomes" of schooling, but the school's impact in the market. In a market, a school must "sell" and parents must "buy."  That is the market<I>par excellence</I>. Goods and services that do not sell have no effect; indeed, they do not stay in the market. Only monopolists -- particularly government monopolists -- stay in markets when no rational consumer wants their product or service. Poor children, for all practical purposes, today have no options.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This issue came to a head this year when Congress considered school choice as part of the Washington, D.C., FY 1996 appropriations bill. Representative Steve Gunderson (R-WI) offered an amendment that would have given scholarships of up to $3,000 for students whose family incomes were at or below the poverty level and up to $1,500 for students whose family incomes were not more than 185 percent above the poverty level. The Senate, however, when presented with this opportunity to expand choice for children in Washington's failing public school system, refused to do so. Only four members of the Senate had sent their children to D.C.'s public schools.<sup>19</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The obvious assumption, of course, is that D.C.'s public school system is tolerable for poor children but not a serious option for members of the United States Senate.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
On the wisdom of these official restrictions, let the late Professor James Coleman answer the critics. His is an eloquent summation of the case for justice and dignity:
<p><blockquote>
	There may be a rationale for some protective barriers to encourage participation in the public schools, but certainly not those that exist now, which harm most the interests of those least well-off and protect most those public schools that are the worst. In short, the tuition barrier to private schooling as it exists now is almost certainly harmful to the public interest, and especially harmful to the interests of those least well-off.<sup>20</sup>
</blockquote> <p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As Members of Congress consider the Watts-Talent school choice provisions, they have another chance to do the right thing.

<li>    The most important work in this field is that of the late sociologist James Coleman. A researcher of towering intellect and erudition who also was devoid of ideological predisposition, Coleman followed the data wherever they led, often at the cost of personal peace of mind. He was vilified by the American Sociological Association for taking the politically incorrect position that public support of private schooling was a defensible public policy option (although, to its credit, the ASA retracted its condemnation to award him a medal shortly before his death). Coleman never wavered in his quiet and determined defense of the truth as he understood it. While his prose style and the heavy quantitative emphasis of his major works are a bit daunting for the generalist, his articles are clear, concise, and lively. A perfect example -- as current today as when it was published -- is "Public Schools, Private Schools, and the Public Interest," <I>The Public Interest</I>, No. 64 (Summer 1981). Father Andrew M. Greeley's work is on point as well. In particular, see <I>Catholic High Schools and Minority Students</I> (New Brunswick, N.J.: Transaction Books, 1982).<p>
<li>    In particular, see "Foreword," in Thomas Vitullo-Martin and Bruce S. Cooper, <I>Separation of Church and Child: The Constitution and Federal Aid to Religious Schools</I> (Indianapolis, Ind.: Hudson Institute, 1987).<p>
<li>       See Charles L. Glenn, <I>Choice of Schools in Six Nations</I> (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Department of Education, 1989), and <I>Educational Freedom in Eastern Europe</I> (Washington, D.C.: Cato Institute, 1995). Glenn, one of the nation's leading authorities on public funding for attendance at private schools, for 21 years was the Massachusetts State Department of Education official responsible for civil rights and urban education opportunity. Recognizing the failure of busing, Glenn pioneered education choice programs.<p>
<li>   One long-standing trend, the concentration of high test scores in the Northern tier of states from Maine to Montana, led Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-NY) to propose facetiously the following policy remedy to states concerned about low test scores: Move your state north.<p>
<li>    Coleman's first major study which permitted a systematic examination of this and related questions was prepared under the terms of a major grant from the U.S. Office of Education, part of the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare (now the Department of Health and Human Services). Titled <I>Equality of Educational Opportunity</I>, it was released in 1966 and caused an immediate sensation. Coleman and his colleagues could find no school effects of consequence; indeed, any school effect seemed to be overwhelmed by student background characteristics. Policymakers were led in two different directions by this surprising "non-finding."  Many analysts concluded that school effects were minimal (at least from a public policy standpoint; they still put their own children in "good" schools). Needless to say, their public policy conclusion was a counsel of despair; after all, the whole American experiment in self-governance was based on the Founders' conviction that an educated citizenry is essential to democracy. The other direction, equally misleading, fueled the notion that black children could learn only if they were integrated with white children. While racial integration is a laudable objective, it is patronizing in the extreme to argue that black children must be integrated to learn. More to the point is the quality of facilities, books, teacher preparation, and the like.<p>

<li>    Although most Americans are convinced that private schools are simply better than public schools, this is not an altogether implausible proposition. It was true in Australia, leading the Australian Labour Party (similar to the Democratic Party in the United States) to support public aid to private schools. Sparked by the work of Father James Carroll, who later became Bishop of Sydney, public funding was made available on the basis of the following argument: Catholic schools are inferior (by almost any academic or fiscal measure) and will remain so unless public funding is provided; Catholics (and non-Catholics who attend these schools) will not abandon their schools; and no good public end is served by denying poor Australian children a quality education in the schools in which they chose to enroll.

Doyle, "Family Choice in Education: The Case of Denmark, Holland and Australia," in <I>Private Schools and Public Policy: International Perspectives</I>, ed. William Lowe Boyd and James G.

<li>  
 Not to put too fine a point on it, but private schools are a red flag to the public school bull. The intensity of the hostility most public school leaders feel for private schools is understood more easily in psychological terms than in logical terms. Private schools, for example, are accused of being "elitist," a sin as serious as racism or sexism in the modern pantheon of bad attitudes. But the facts, as Coleman and others have revealed, are otherwise. For a longer disquisition on this general subject, see "A Din of Inequity?  Private Schools Reconsidered," <I>Teachers College Record</I>, Vol. 82, No. 4 (Summer 198l).<p>

<li>   An example of more than passing importance, Father Clemens's school operates on an extended day and year, is in the middle of the ghetto, has a waiting list, accepts only children from families on welfare, and still charges tuition. His reasoning?  If they can afford a phone, a TV, sneakers, and Bulls jackets, they can scrape together some tuition. Moreover, all families are expected to give time to school projects -- not just the PTA, but painting and fix-up activities as well. Finally, families that really cannot afford any tuition are allowed to "work off" the obligation: Families that pay something are families that take school seriously.<p>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
Congress soon will have an opportunity to promote the moral renewal and economic revitalization of America's most poverty-stricken urban and rural areas. The measure to accomplish this task is Saving Our Children: The American Community Renewal Act of 1996 (<a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.3467:">H.R. 3467</a>), sponsored by Representatives J. C. Watts (R-OK) and <a href="http://www.house.gov/talent/welcome.html">James Talent</a> (R-MO). The bill would assist families in areas with high rates of poverty, crime, welfare dependency, joblessness, and poor schools. Through serious tax incentives and regulatory relief, coupled with innovative school reform pilot projects and home ownership incentives, the bill would achieve:<ul>

<p><li>Increased job creation;

<p><li>Small business expansion and formation;

<p.<li>Moral renewal;

<p><li>Expanded educational opportunities;

<p><li>Greater private philanthropy to aid the poor; and

<p><li>Greater participation by religious organizations in providing services to the poor.
</ul> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

Far too many of America's urban and rural neighborhoods are characterized by large numbers of people in poverty, as well as by juvenile crime, illegitimacy, joblessness, and female-headed households. Because companies are not investing in these areas, local economic growth and opportunity are hampered. And quick-fix short-term solutions, such as raising the minimum wage, do little to help improve the lives of people entangled in a web of poverty, crime, and illegitimacy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

The problems of these communities are related to weaknesses of the local economy and the weakening of the moral and social fabric of the community itself; for policymakers to view the decline of these communities as the result of only one or the other prevents them from bringing about real and sustainable reform. Congress needs to strip away regulatory and institutional barriers that thwart rebuilding the broken lives and economies of these areas. The adoption of a wholly new and comprehensive urban policy of the sort that is embodied in the Saving Our Children bill would help the citizens of these communities achieve a better life for themselves and their children, not just by creating a far more favorable climate for business activity, but also by empowering the citizens of these communities to become active decision makers in their own lives and the lives of their children rather than merely passive subjects of the decisions of inflexible government social service and education bureaucracies.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

Recent studies have shown that a comprehensive approach to community development is the best way to bring substantive change to distressed and impoverished communities. It also appears that the social programs that work best are community-based. Such local initiatives are the most effective means of attacking the often difficult problems that individuals and families have with joblessness, poor education, crime, drugs, and welfare dependency. For example, a 1989 study reported that 81 percent of families in poverty face multiple obstacles to achieving self-sufficiency.<sup>1</sup>  For many years, government agencies have tended to focus on single issues, such as housing or health. But policymakers increasingly are realizing that a piece-by-piece approach to urban policy is not likely to succeed. As Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry Cisneros puts it, "We believe the best strategy to community development is a community-driven, comprehensive approach which coordinates economic, physical, environmental, community and human needs."<sup>2</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

The Saving Our Children bill gives Congress and the Administration an opportunity to act on this commitment and change the way the federal government has been involved in community development over the last 30 years. By lessening federal regulations and taxes, and increasing parents' freedom to choose schools that reflect their ideals, the communities that need the most assistance can serve as local laboratories of reform, generating ideas and inspiration for various other communities across the nation, as well as for policymakers in Washington.
<p>
<b>WHAT THE SAVING OUR CHILDREN BILL DOES</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

The Saving Our Children bill has five main elements. The first two apply to the 100 "renewal communities" created by the bill. The remaining three major reforms apply nationwide.
<p>
<b>1. Creation of Renewal Communities.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

Title I creates up to 100 renewal communities across the nation, based on the degree to which an area is characterized by poverty and distress. Through tax relief, regulatory reform, and savings incentives for Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) recipients, this title would aid the poorest communities in the nation. Specifically, it would:<ul>

<p><li><b>Provide</b> federal, state, and local tax and regulatory relief through provisions such as 100 percent capital gains tax exclusion on qualified assets held within a renewal community for at least five years.

<p><li><b>Enhance and increase</b> community involvement and ownership, in part through the creation of Family Development Accounts. These accounts would encourage EITC recipients to save money tax-free for certain expenditures such as higher education or buying a home for the first time.

<p><li><b>Improve</b> the delivery of local government services by encouraging privatization and increases in efficiency.

<p><li><b>Encourage</b> financial institutions to maintain a presence and invest in designated renewal communities.
</ul>
<p>
<b>2. Education Scholarships for Poor Children within Renewal Communities.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

As a condition of becoming a renewal community, a locality would administer the federally funded Low-Income Educational Opportunity Scholarship Program established under Title IV of the bill. Low-income parents within the renewal community would be given federally funded scholarships to send their children to primary and secondary schools chosen by the parent. Poor parents would be able to use these scholarships to choose to send their children to a variety of schools, including alternative public schools, private schools, and private religious schools. Because religious schools can play a critical role in rebuilding the moral foundation of America's inner cities, they are included as an essential component of the scholarship program.

<p>
<b>3. Charitable Contribution Tax Credit.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

To encourage charitable contributions to private organizations aiding the poor, the bill would create a tax credit that refunds 75 percent of a taxpayer's contribution to any private charity engaged primarily in providing direct services to the poor. The maximum eligible contribution would be $200 for single filers and $400 for joint filers. The credit would be available to all federal income tax filers nationwide, regardless of whether they itemize deductions on their tax returns.
<p>

<b>4. Prevention and Treatment of Substance Abuse.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

Until now, religiously affiliated drug treatment centers have been hampered in their ability to receive funds under the Public Health Service Act. Title III of the bill would amend current law to allow such organizations to receive federal funds for the treatment services they provide without restricting their religious activity. In addition, this section recognizes that religious education and religiously motivated drug treatment personnel can have a vital and important role in effective drug treatment. Thus, it would loosen unnecessary bureaucratic credentialing requirements on treatment staff which may bar religious drug treatment programs from receiving federal drug rehabilitation funds. These provisions would apply nationwide.

<p>
<b>5. Work Opportunity Tax Credit.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
With teenage unemployment at nearly 20 percent, this provision gives employers tax incentives to hire individuals who are welfare recipients or "high-risk" youth, the persons who have a more difficult time securing permanent employment. This tax provision also would apply nationwide.
<p>

<b>CREATING RENEWAL COMMUNITIES</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Under Title 1, state or local governments would apply to the U.S. Department of Housing and Development (HUD) to have certain depressed areas designated as "renewal communities."  Up to 100 such communities would be created nationwide. To qualify under the terms of the bill, the local area must be low income, and local authorities must agree both to ease regulations that impede economic activity and to operate the scholarship program for poor children provided in Title IV. If more than 100 localities applied to become renewal communities, HUD would select the 100 poorest. Upon becoming a renewal community, a locality would receive substantial tax and regulatory relief. Designated renewal communities would retain their status for seven years.
<p>

<b>1) Eligible Areas.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To become one of the 100 renewal communities, a local area would have to be nominated by a state or local government officials and would have to meet the following criteria:
<ul>
<p><li>The locality must be an economically depressed area within a larger city or county.

<p><li>The locality must be characterized by pervasive poverty and distress and entirely located within the jurisdiction of a local government eligible to receive Community Development Block Grant funds (according to Section 119 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974). This means that a renewal community must be a subsection within the jurisdiction of a local government that is itself characterized by poverty and distress, not simply a pocket of poverty within an area of general affluence.

<p><li>The unemployment rate within the locality must be 1 1/2 times the national unemployment rate.

<p><li>Each census tract within the locality must have a poverty rate of at least 20 percent.

<p><li>At least 70 percent of the households within the locality must have incomes below 80 percent of the median income of households within the jurisdiction of local government.

<p><li>The locality must have a continuous boundary and be located within the jurisdiction of one local government.

<p><li>If any part of an area is located within a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) with a population greater than 50,000, the minimum population within the renewal community area must be at least 4,000. For all other non-rural and non-MSA areas, the population within the proposed community must be at least 1,000 or located entirely within an Indian Reservation.

<p><li>Ten percent of the renewal communities must be in rural areas. For an area to be considered "rural," it must be within a local government jurisdiction with less than 50,000 people, be outside a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) as defined by the Census bureau, or otherwise be considered rural by the Secretary of HUD.
</ul>
<p>
<b>2) Required Commitments by Local Officials.</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
For an area to become a renewal community, state and local government officials and representatives of neighborhood organizations must express in writing their commitment to reduce taxes, regulations, and burdens on businesses within the renewal community area in at least five of the following seven ways:
<ul>
<p><li><b>Reduce</b> taxes and fees;

<p><li><b>Increase</b> the level of efficiency of local services;

<p><li><b>Develop and implement</b> crime reduction strategies;

<p><li><b>Streamline</b> government requirements and regulations;

<p><li><b>Foster</b> coordination between and involvement of private organizations and community groups, and encourage such groups to provide jobs and job training, technical, financial, or other assistance to employers, employees, and other residents from the renewal community;<sup>3</sup>

<p><li><b>Provide</b> state or local income tax benefits for fees paid for services, such as trash collection, that formerly were performed by the government but now are privatized; and

<p><li><b>Encourage</b> the donation or sale of land, homes, and commercial/industrial structures to neighborhood organizations, community development corporations, or private companies.
</ul><p>

<b>3) Required Economic Growth Measures.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To establish a renewal community, state and local officials must repeal or suspend government regulations, except for those required to protect health and safety. These include:
<ul>
<p><li><b>License requirements</b> for occupations that do not require a professional degree;

<P><li><b>Zoning restrictions</b> on home-based businesses that are not a public nuisance;

<p><li><b>Permit requirements</b> for street vendors that are not a public nuisance;

<p><li><b>Zoning and other restrictions</b> that impede the formation of schools and child care centers; and

<p><li><b>Restrictions on competition</b> for businesses providing public services, such as cable TV, taxicabs, or trash removal.
</ul>
<p>
<b>4) Tax Breaks to Stimulate Jobs in Poor Neighborhoods.</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Enterprise Zones, if crafted correctly, hold great promise in restoring economic vitality to poor neighborhoods.<sup>4</sup>  Experience with "enterprise zones" has shown that targeted tax relief on business activity in depressed inner city areas over time can cut the unemployment rate in those areas by a third or more.<sup>5</sup>  To create jobs and stimulate business activity in local communities, the Watts-Talent bill will match tax cutting and deregulation at the local level with a sharp reduction in federal taxes within the locality.
<p>
<b>Exclusion from Capital Gains.</b> Once a local area has been designated a renewal community, the bill would reduce federal taxes on private investment in any qualified renewal community enterprise (defined as a business that derives at least 80 percent of its gross income from within the community and has at least 35 percent of its employees living in the renewal community). The tax benefits for investment in qualified businesses within the renewal community area include a 100 percent exclusion of capital gains tax. An individual would not be taxed for any capital gains resulting from the sale of assets of a qualified renewal community enterprise held for more than five years. This exclusion is limited to $100,000 per tax year and a $500,000 total.
<p>
<b>Deduction of Stock Purchases.</b> Individuals in these communities would have the option to deduct certain purchases of stock of qualified renewal community enterprises instead of taking the 100 percent exclusion from capital gains.
<p>
<b>Deduction for Tangible Property.</b> Individuals and businesses in these communities also would have reduced up-front taxation on investments in tangible property within the renewal community. Under current federal income tax law, businesses and individuals may deduct up $17,500 from their federal income tax to cover current year capital investment costs.<sup>6</sup>  Under the Watts-Talent bill, an extra $35,000 could be deducted for investment in renewal community businesses.<sup>7</sup>
i<p>
<b>Tax Credit for Revitalization.</b> To encourage the renovation of decaying buildings that often blight impoverished areas, Section 107 of the bill gives taxpayers a tax credit equal to a percentage of their qualified revitalization expenditures within the renewal community. A person either could receive up front a tax credit of 20 percent of revitalization expenditures for the tax year a revitalized building is completed or could elect to receive a credit of 5 percent each year for ten years, beginning with the year the building is completed. The maximum expenditure for which a taxpayer may receive credit is $10 million. The building may not be a residence and must be located within the renewal community, and the revitalization costs must exceed 25 percent of the fair market value of the structure.
<p>
<b>Establishing Family Development Accounts for Renewal Community EITC Recipients.</b> Section 106 of the bill also authorizes the creation of Family Development Accounts (FDAs) designed to encourage low-income families to save a portion of their income or their Earned Income Tax Credit refund. Cash donations would be deductible, even if the individual does not itemize. Withdrawals from these accounts would be tax-free if the money is used for certain specified expenditures. Contributions to FDAs would be limited to the lesser of $2,000 or the total amount of a person's compensation included in gross income for a given tax year. Persons donating to the family accounts of others would be limited to a deduction of $1,000.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Family Development Account funds can be used tax-free for the following expenses:
<ul>
<p><li>Post-secondary education tuition and expenses;

<p><li>First-home purchasing costs;

<p><li>Business capitalization expenditures, including capital, plant, equipment, working capital, and inventory expenses, with such businesses required to have an approved business plan;

<p><li>Medical expenses not otherwise covered by insurance; and

<p><li>Qualified rollovers which involve paying into another individual's FDA with funds from one's own account.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
If an employer paid into a worker's FDA, the employer's contribution also would be counted as compensation. Matches also could be provided by state or local governments, service organizations, corporations, local churches, foundations, or other such organizations.
<p>

<b>5. FDA Matching Fund Program Demonstration Areas. </b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Under the bill, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development could select up to 25 communities, with a minimum of two rural areas and based on their relative impoverishment, to serve as demonstration areas for an FDA matching fund program. Within these areas, each qualified individual would have an amount, equal to the amount deposited into the FDA account by the individual, matched by the federal government. This matching amount would be limited to $1,000 each year. The maximum one person could ever receive from the federal government is $2,000.

<p>
<b>6. Community Reinvestment Act.</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;  
To encourage financial institutions to maintain a presence and invest in designated renewal communities, Section 501 of Title V directs that such efforts be taken into account when assessing an institution's compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (12 USC 2903).
<p>
<b>7. FDA Application Fees.</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;  
Section 502 waives "application fees" required by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to approve a drug developed within a renewal community.

<p>
<b>LOW-INCOME EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In order to become a renewal community, local officials also must agree to operate the bill's Low-Income Educational Opportunity Scholarship Program for poor children within the community. The program provides federally funded scholarships to enable poor parents to send their children to a broader range of primary and secondary schools. It has two goals:
<ul>
<p><li>GOAL #1: To expand educational opportunity for poor children by giving their parents a broader range of choice in determining where the child goes to school; and
<p><li>GOAL #2: To foster moral renewal in a community by enabling poor parents to send their children to religious schools which teach moral principles and instill virtue as an essential ingredient of education.
</ul><p>
<b>Parental Right of Choice.</b> Parents would be eligible to receive funds under the scholarship program for their children if (a) they live in the designated renewal community; (b) the family income does not exceed 185 percent of the poverty line; and (c) they have elected to participate in the program.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Parents of children who received financial assistance under this program would be free to choose from a wide range of types of schools, including alternative public schools, charter schools, private schools, and private religious schools.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A parent would be able to redeem a scholarship at any private or private religious school within the locality which meets the health and educational standards for private schools within the locality which existed as of January 1, 1996.<sup>8</sup>  All schools which redeemed these special scholarships would be required to comply with the anti-discrimination provisions of Section 601 of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and not to discriminate on the basis of race.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The bill would require renewal communities to give parents timely information to enable them to make informed decisions about the education of their children. At the very least, the information would have to explain the scholarship fund, describe the eligibility requirements and selection procedure, and provide information about alternative public schools and scholarship schools.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A locality would have to allocate scholarships and transportation aid to eligible parents who apply for aid on a first-come, first-served basis or through another mechanism of selection determined by the locality which does not discriminate on the basis of the type of school selected by the parent. The scholarships are not entitlements.

<p>
<b>Types and Value of Scholarships for Poor Children</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Far too many poor children are trapped in poorly performing schools. Funds under the program are intended to broaden the educational choices of poor parents and children within the renewal community. If the parents chose to send their child to an alternative public school where tuition is already paid, under the bill they would receive funds to cover the costs of transportation. If they elected to send their child to a private school, they would receive a scholarship for the child which could be used only to pay for tuition and educational fees at the selected school.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Each locality would determine the precise monetary value of scholarships for children in their locality. The bill establishes the range of local options, but the maximum value of the scholarship also must not exceed the per capita cost of educating children in a public school in the locality. Further, the scholarship must have minimum value, which shall not fall below the lesser of a) 60 percent of the average cost of educating children in the public schools in the locality during the preceding year or b) the normal tuition charged by the private school.<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Each renewal community would be given a fixed amount each year to pay for scholarships and transportation aid for poor children. If the number of low-income parents who applied for scholarships and or transportation aid was insufficient to utilize all the funds available, any surplus funds could be used to assist in educating low-income children within the community's public schools.
<p>

<b>Poor Parents, Poor Children, and Religious Schools</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Americans are increasingly concerned about the character and quality of the social order, the apparent decline in the culture, and the corrosive influences of that culture on family life and the moral condition of the country. These concerns are common to Americans, regardless of their racial or income group or where they live and work. For a variety of reasons, individuals and families, children especially, are even more vulnerable to social pathologies, including violent crime, illegal drug use, and illegitimacy and family breakdown.<sup>10</sup>
<p>
<b>Importance of Religion.</b> A central goal of the  Saving Our Children bill is to foster moral renewal in inner-city communities wracked by crime, drug abuse, sexual promiscuity, and family disintegration. The sponsors of the bill recognize that building a sound moral foundation is the most important aspect of a child's education and that moral renewal is critical to solving urban social problems. The power of religion to help the poor help themselves is amply documented.<sup>11</sUP>  Investigating the condition of black inner-city youth, Richard Freeman of Harvard University finds that boys who regularly attend church are 50 percent less likely to engage in crime than boys of similar backgrounds who do not attend church; they also are 54 percent less likely to use drugs and 47 percent less likely to drop out of school.<sup>12</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Boys and girls who attend church regularly are two-thirds less likely to engage in sexual activity in their teens. Regular church attendance halves the probability that a woman will have a child out of wedlock.<sup>13</sUP>  Children attending religious schools are two-thirds less likely to drop out than are nearly identical children who attend secular schools.<sup>14</sup>  Children ages 10 to 18 who do not attend church are a third to a half more likely to exhibit anti-social and dysfunctional behavior.<sup>15</sUP>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Social consequences follow from school choice.<sup>16</sup>  The bill therefore helps poor parents give their children a sound moral upbringing by allowing them to use scholarships to send children to religious schools.
<p>
<b>Constitutional Issues.</b> The Supreme Court has held that as long as the parent, not the government, decides where the scholarship will be spent on a child's behalf, public funds can be used for education in a religious institution because the government has neither advanced nor inhibited a particular religion and therefore has not violated the establishment clause of the First Amendment.<sup>17</sup>  For example, in the 1986 case of <I>Witters v. Washington Department of Services for the Blind,</I> Larry Witters, a blind man, wished to use state vocational funds to attend religious seminary to help him fulfill his personal goal of becoming a minister. The U.S. Supreme Court held unanimously that Witters's use of state vocational funds to attend seminary did not violate the U.S. Constitution. Writing for the majority, Justice Thurgood Marshall asserted:
<blockquote>
	It is well settled that the Establishment Clause is not violated every time money previously in the possession of a state is conveyed to a religious institution. For example, a State may issue a paycheck to one of its employees, who may then donate all or part of that paycheck to a religious institution, all without constitutional barriers.<sup>18</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Justice Marshall further argued that it was permissible for Witters to use government vocational funds to attend seminary because the individual, not the government itself, was determining how to allocate the money:
<blockquote>
	Any aid provided under Washington's program that ultimately flows to religious institutions does so only as a result of the genuinely independent and private choices of aid recipients. The decision to support religious education is made by the individual, not the state.<sup>19</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Under the bill, local officials may not prohibit poor parents from using the Watts-Talent scholarships to pay for tuition in religious schools and may not discriminate in any way against parents who choose to place their child in a religious school. If provisions of a state constitution prohibit state and local funds from being spent at religious institutions,<sup>20</sup> the renewal community can segregate all federal funds from state funds. But state and local officials may not prevent poor parents from using federal scholarship funds designated for poor children to pay for tuition in religious schools.
<p>

<b>Eligible Schools and Civil Rights Safeguards</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To receive scholarships, a school must comply with relevant anti-discrimination provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and also must satisfy applicable state and local requirements for curriculum and facilities and meet health and safety standards which existed as of January 1996. Schools are ineligible, however, if they advocate criminal behavior or are operated by an organization advocating criminal behavior.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The sponsors of the bill are careful to ensure that the scholarships will not become a Trojan horse leading to a government takeover of private or religious schools. The bill includes specific safeguards both to protect private schools which redeem scholarships from government intrusiveness and to protect the liberty of religious schools:
<ul>
<p><li>No additional regulations on burdensome paperwork may be imposed on private schools which redeem scholarships;

<p><li>Private schools redeeming scholarships will not be subject to regulations restricting religious instruction and shall be protected by the rights granted in the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993;

<p><li>Any religious school may require its employees to adhere to its religious tenets and moral code of behavior;<sup>21</sup> and

<p><li>Private schools will be permitted to operate as single-sex institutions, or to operate classes separated by gender (Section 409[b][6]).
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The bill's language also includes a critical clarification to protect personal and religious liberty: No provision may be construed to give the federal government authority to direct or control the curriculum, administration, or personnel of any private school participating in the scholarship program (Section 410[c]).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The bill would require evaluation of the effects of the scholarship program. It authorizes studies comparing the performance of children with similar backgrounds to determine whether those from renewal communities who participate in the scholarship program outperform those who do not. In addition, the authorized studies would examine parental involvement and the degree to which it is improved when parents are able to choose where they send their children to school.

<p>
<b>Targeting Education Funds to Poor Communities</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Federal scholarship funds would be channeled to renewal communities through two funding tiers, with 80 percent of the funds allocated through the first tier. Under the first tier, the share of federal funds received by a renewal community shall be pro-rated based on the number of school-age children with family incomes below 185 percent of poverty residing in the community, relative to the total number of such low-income children residing in all renewal communities nationwide.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Twenty percent of scholarship funds must be allocated through the second tier. To encourage private-sector and state and local government contributions to the scholarship program, second tier funds are to be divided according to the level of non-federal financial support given to the program within each locality. The share of these funds given to a specific renewal community would be equal to that community's pro-rated share of non-federal contributions to the scholarship program within all renewal communities nationwide.
<p>

<b>REINFORCING AMERICA'S INDEPENDENT SECTOR</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To an increasing degree, Americans realize that government solutions to poverty enacted during the latter part of this century have failed. Since the beginning of the War on Poverty in 1965, the U.S. has spent $5.4 trillion to aid low-income Americans.<sup>22</sUp>  But in many ways, poor communities are worse off now than when Congress started to establish this vast array of federal social programs over 30 years ago. The following provisions would apply nationwide.
<p>
<b>A Charitable Tax Credit</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Saving Our Children bill creates a new tax credit, intended to encourage Americans to allocate more of their charitable contributions to private organizations that are fighting poverty effectively with low administrative overhead. According to Section 201 of Title II, taxpayers who donate to a qualified charity would receive a 75 percent tax credit for donations up to $200 for single and $400 for joint filers. This credit would be available regardless of whether a taxpayer itemizes deductions.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A charity is qualified to receive donations under this provision if its predominant activity is the provision of direct services to individuals whose annual incomes generally do not exceed 185 percent of the official poverty line. A qualified charity must provide direct services to low income persons and may not participate in political activities such as lobbying, litigation on behalf of service recipients, public policy advocacy, public policy research, or voter registration.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The bill's underlying philosophical premise is that individual taxpayers, because they are closer to the needs of their communities, are better able to make decisions about where funds should go than are bureaucrats in Washington. They can target funds to programs that work. Giving taxpayers additional means with which to make financial contributions to worthy poverty-fighting organizations would enable them to become more involved in their communities, fostering a greater sense of civic duty and fellowship.
<p>
<b>Using Faith-Based Drug Treatment Centers</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Section 301 of Title III (Prevention and Treatment of Substance Abuse: Services Provided through Religious Organizations) applies nationwide. It amends the Public Health Service Act to meet three goals:<ul>

<p><li><b>To permit</b> faith-based substance abuse treatment centers to receive federal assistance and to prohibit discrimination against such centers;

<p><li><b>To make</b> it easier for individuals receiving federally funded drug treatment to select drug treatment therapy that is religious in nature; and

<p><li><b>To protect</b> the rights of individuals receiving drug treatment by ensuring that no individual can be required to receive services from a religious organization and guaranteeing that individuals who do not wish to receive drug treatment services from religious entities must be provided with alternative secular services.
<p></ul>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Faith-based drug treatment is different from secular treatment in that it encourages a person to look beyond himself for the strength to overcome addiction. That apparently is why faith-based treatment is more effective than secular treatment: Individuals in any religious denomination or group have lower levels of drug use regardless of whether the denomination teaches against the use of alcohol, although denominations that teach against any use of drugs or alcohol exhibit the highest rates of drug avoidance.<sup>23</sup>  Likewise, religion has been shown to be a powerful force in helping alcoholics abstain from alcohol. For over half a century, Alcoholics Anonymous has encouraged participants to invoke a higher power to help them recover from their addiction.<sup>24</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In reviewing the religious treatment of addicts, research psychiatrists at the Duke University Department of Psychiatry concluded in 1992 that the "role of religious commitment and religiously oriented treatment programs can be significant factors which ought to be considered and included when planning a mix of appropriate treatment alternatives.... Perhaps the greatest advantage of religious programs is their recourse to churches as a support system.... Religious treatment programs are not suitable for everyone. For those men and women who can accept the creeds, rituals, and commitments required of such programs there seem to be certain advantages."<sup>25</sup>
<p>
<b>Eliminating Discrimination.</b> Under Title III of the bill, religious organizations are eligible to receive program funds and provide drug treatment services on the same basis as any other nonprofit private organization. While religious organizations would be required to meet the general requirements for effective drug treatment, neither the federal government nor any state government receiving federal treatment funds shall discriminate against an organization because of its religious character. Neither the federal nor any state government could interfere with the definition, practice, or expression of an organization's religious beliefs; nor could they require the organization to alter its form of internal governance or remove religious art, icons, sacred scripture, or other such symbols. Religious organizations which receive funds under the bill also could require any or all employees to adhere to their organizational religious and moral tenets.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
At the same time, the language of the bill would protect the religious liberty of drug users receiving treatment. Any person who objects to participating in a drug treatment program operated by a religious organization shall be given the option of receiving treatment in an alternative program operated by a secular organization.
<p>
<b>Personal Help.</b> States may provide beneficiaries with vouchers that enable them to choose among a wide variety of drug treatment programs under Title III. If a person needing drug treatment is given a voucher or other mode of reimbursement which enables that person to select the treatment program in which he will participate, the drug treatment monies may be used for any religious worship and instruction which is part of the overall drug treatment. This provision is fully in accord with U.S. Supreme Court rulings on the religious establishment clause in <I>Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School District , Mueller v. Allen, and Witters v. Washington Dept. of Services for Blind.</I>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
If a person with a drug abuse problem freely elects to participate in a religious drug treatment program rather than secular alternatives, the individual could be required to follow the rules set forth in the program and to participate in any religious practice or instruction that is part of the treatment program. Any individual who does not wish to participate in a drug treatment program operated by a religious organization is given the full right to refuse such treatment. Such individuals must be given the option of attending an equivalent alternative secular treatment program.
<p>
<b>Broadening Help for the Addicted.</b> The bill's language also stipulates that state or local governments should recognize that religious education can have a critical role in providing effective drug treatment. In applying education qualifications as a condition for receiving federal funds, state or local governments would have to give credit for religious education that is equivalent to the credit given for secular course-work of similar grade levels and duration. Furthermore, any religious organization which is barred from receipt of federal drug treatment funds by means of education and credentialing standards imposed by state or local government could appeal to the Secretary of Labor to waive such standards. The Secretary must waive the standards if:
<ul>
<p><li>The organization has provided effective drug treatment for at least three years;
<p><li>The Secretary determines the requirements for education and training of personnel effectively bar the organization from receipt of funds; and
<p><li>The state or local government is unable to demonstrate empirically that such qualifications are necessary to have a successful drug treatment program.
<p>
</ul>
<b>CREATING REAL JOBS IN POOR NEIGHBORHOODS</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Work Opportunity Tax Credit, found in Section 201 of Title II of the bill, is designed to encourage the employment and economic betterment of those whose past makes it difficult for them to secure a job and make a fresh start. The bill would replace the expired Targeted Jobs Tax Credit (TJTC). The Work Opportunity Tax Credit offsets the cost of hiring persons who fall into a number of categories, including AFDC or food stamp recipients and their families; economically disadvantaged veterans, ex-felons, and high-risk youth; vocational rehabilitation referrals; and qualified summer youth employees.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Employers would be eligible to claim a 35 percent credit on the first $6,000 of first-year wages paid to a qualifying individual (for a maximum credit of $2,100). In the case of certain summer youth, employers could claim a 35 percent credit on $3,000 of wages (for a maximum credit of $1,050).
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Congress has an opportunity to change the direction of American social policy. The American Community Renewal Act of 1996 contains a new comprehensive strategy to help resolve America's urban problems. It assumes that the choices and decisions of low-income Americans who want to help each other and themselves should be respected, is grounded in the experience of local organizations and community groups, and harnesses the initiative and genius of local institutions in an empowerment strategy that can work.
<p>
Specifically:<ul>

<p><li><b>The bill would reduce urban unemployment by reducing the tax and regulatory burden on businesses in inner-city areas.</b> This type of economic policy can reduce unemployment in affected localities by a third or more.

<p><li><b>The bill would expand educational opportunity by providing poor parents with scholarships which could be used to pay for tuition in private schools.</b> By giving poor parents the same sort of choice in education that middle-class families already have, the bill would increase parental involvement, improve the quality of education, and reduce the rate of school failure.

<p><li><b>The bill would help churches and religious institutions rebuild the moral foundations of inner cities by allowing poor parents to enroll their children in religious schools.</b> The authors of the bill recognize the simple and uncomplicated truth that the development of a strong moral character, reinforced by religious discipline and the habitual practice of virtue, is the necessary basis for success in school, in work, and in life itself. The church, as an institution, is society's most effective weapon in saving children from alcohol abuse, illegal drugs, violent crime, sexual promiscuity, illegitimacy, and dependence. By allowing inner-city churches, through a school choice program, to play a far greater and more decisive role in shaping the hearts and minds of America's young people, the Saving Our Children bill would be a large step forward in combating the social ills that plague America's inner cities.

<p><li><b>The bill would further encourage Americans from all walks of life to become more directly involved in the basic business of financing social service programs to help the poor.</b> It would expand the role of private-sector charity in aiding the poor. Federal, state, and local governments spend nearly $400 billion each year on a wide variety of programs to aid low-income Americans. By a wide margin, the public regards many, if not most, of these government programs as failures. By providing a generous tax credit for individual taxpayer donations to private charities which aid the poor, the Watts-Talent bill would enable the private sector, and religious charities in particular, to bring new and innovative local approaches to the struggle against poverty, drugs, family disintegration, and crime through programs that work and can make a real difference in the lives of young men and women.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The comprehensive urban policy embodied in the Saving Our Children bill gives Congress an excellent opportunity to make a bipartisan stand for children. It rejects the premise that all that is needed for our nation's poorest communities are larger benefit checks from the government. It goes beyond simply managing the symptoms of impoverishment to tackle the root causes of poverty, crime, and illegitimacy. It establishes the economic conditions which enable depressed communities to become more profitable places for work and business. And it recognizes and harnesses the positive energy of the nation's churches and religious institutions to advance the character and quality of American life.

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The United States Supreme Court noted many years ago that "The primary role of the parents in the upbringing of their children is now established beyond debate as an enduring American tradition."<sup>3</sup>  And President Bill Clinton, in his 1994 State of the Union speech, declared that "We cannot renew our country until we realize that governments don't raise children, parents do."<sup>4</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Congress is poised to give legislative form to these sentiments. The Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act (S. 984 and H.R. 1946), introduced by Senator Charles Grassley (R-IA) and Representative Steve Largent (R-OK), would give parents the standing in law to protect their rights to direct the education and to protect and form the moral character of their children. In fact, it would give them superior standing over government and its agencies in these matters: The bill declares that parents' rights to direct the upbringing of their children are fundamental rights which government can curtail only under conditions of "compelling interest" and under "strict guidelines" of judicial procedure, legal terms which guide courts in their decisions.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Congressional proponents of the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act contend that parental rights over the rearing of children are so basic that the Founders never even conceived of their being usurped by government. These rights, precisely because they are basic to the concept of liberty, should not be abridged by government except in the most unusual circumstances. They are liberty rights, protected by the Fifth Amendment. The bill would make this clear.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Parental rights concern the relationship between government -- federal, state, and local -- and parents in the raising of children. This area of civil liberties is the domain of Congress and the Supreme Court, with the Fourteenth Amendment clearly giving Congress the power to pass legislation to enforce such constitutional rights and protecting citizens against the abridgment of their rights by government:<blockquote>
	All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside. No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States....<sup>5</sup>
<p>
	The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.<sup>6</sup>
</blockquote><P>

<B>The Erosion of Parental Authority</B>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Over the years, widely scattered and repeated attacks on the fundamental rights of parents have come from state and local courts; from federal, state, and local government bureaucracies and officials; and from policy initiatives inspired by a number of the major professions dealing with children. Certain members of these professions seem more concerned with displacing parents than with aiding them. In fact, the bill is opposed by many liberal groups wishing to change the relationship between government and the family, including the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund, the American Civil Liberties Union, and the National Education Association.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While critics say the bill would cause confusion in child abuse and domestic relations law and procedure, congressional sponsors argue that child abuse is not a parental right and that they explicitly left all child abuse and domestic relations concerns outside the scope of the bill. These clearly are within the proper scope of state authority.
<P>

<B>WHAT THE BILL DOES</B>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Section 4 of the bill clarifies and codifies the rights of parents already affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court: "No Federal, State or local government, or any official of such a government acting under color of law, shall interfere with or usurp the right of a parent to direct the upbringing of the child of the parent."

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

According to Section 3, the parent's right to direct the upbringing of a child includes the right to:
<UL>
<p><li><b>Direct or provide</b> for the education of the child;

<p><li><b>Make</b> a health or mental health decision for the child, with exceptions;<sup>7</sup>

<p><li><b>Discipline</b> the child, including reasonable corporal punishment as already defined by the Supreme Court; and

<p><li><b>Direct or provide</b> for the religious and moral formation of the child.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
It also makes clear the procedure the courts must follow when these rights are to be denied by the state. The standard to which the courts must hold all levels of government in any move to deny parents their rights is laid out simply in Section 5:<blockquote>

	No exception to [the right] shall be permitted, unless the government is able to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence, that the interference or usurpation is essential to accomplish a compelling government interest and is narrowly drawn or applied in a manner that is the least restrictive means of accomplishing the compelling interest.</blockquote>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This would establish a clear standard of judicial review whenever a state challenges parents. The government or its agencies would have to demonstrate a compelling interest in the contravention of parental authority. "Compelling interest" is a standard that demands "strict scrutiny" or "clear and convincing evidence" of the government's compelling and narrowly drawn interest in removing parental authority in the case before the court. It is the highest standard that can be adopted in a civil issue and is the traditional standard used by all when reviewing all other fundamental rights issues. If parental rights are fundamental, therefore, the "strict scrutiny" and "compelling interest" tests ought always to follow.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Section 7 specifically puts certain areas outside the scope of the bill, either because they properly are subject to state law or because they are not parental rights. These areas include the abuse or neglect of a child; domestic relations conflicts between parents, such as divorce and child custody battles; and adoption proceedings.
<p>

<b>Deference to States' Rights</b> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In the United States, family law is made at the state level. The Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act therefore would uphold the role of the states in their relationship to families and parents by depriving no state of any power it retains under the federal Constitution. By clarifying the rights of parents, it would be a defense against intrusion into parental authority either by government (including legislatures, courts, and agency bureaucracies) or by professions acting as agents of government.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
As noted, the bill delineates the areas of state law within which it does not apply. Because family law, as opposed to individual rights, is the domain of the states, the bill does not change definitions in state family law. "The term `child' has the meaning provided by state domestic relations statute," for instance. "The term `parent' has the meaning provided by state domestic relations statute....  The term `direct upbringing of a child' shall not include abandonment, abuse and neglect as the terms have been defined in state statute."<sup>8</sup>  Furthermore, "Nothing in this Act shall be construed to limit the ability of state or local governments from granting greater protection to parental rights."<sup>9</sup>
<p>

<b>THE NATURE OF PARENTAL RIGHTS</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Under American constitutional law, "fundamental rights" are inherent in the person, and government at any level can abridge them only in cases of compelling state interest. The Constitution spells out or provides the basis for a number of such fundamental rights: free speech, freedom of religious practice, freedom from racial discrimination, freedom of the press. Many of these rights are spelled out in detail in statutes enacted by Congress pursuant to the Constitution.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
"Legal rights," by contrast, are not inherent in the person. They are granted by government and therefore can be altered or withdrawn by it. Social Security, Medicare, and welfare entitlements all are examples of legal rights.

<p>
<b>Parental Rights As Fundamental Rights</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
It is the settled view of the U.S. Supreme Court that parental rights are fundamental rights. In 1943, for example, the Court said:<blockquote>

	Constitutional interpretation has consistently recognized that the parents' claim to authority in their own household to direct the upbringing of their children is basic in the structure of our society. It is cardinal with us that the custody, care, and nurture of the child reside first in the parents, whose primary functions and freedom include preparations for obligations the state can neither supply nor hinder.<sup>10</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Supreme Court repeatedly has affirmed the fundamental nature of these rights, including the right to marry; to establish a home and bring up children;<sup>11</sup> to raise these children in their own fashion<sup>12</sup> (whether the children like the way they do it or not);<sup>13</sup> to direct the education of their children and to pass on to them their own principles, faith, and values;<sup>14</sup> to direct their children's religious and moral education;<sup>15</sup> to make medical decisions for their minor children;<sup>16</sup> and to inflict corporal punishment when it is deemed necessary.<sup>17</sup>  In cases as far apart in time as 1925 and 1979, the Court has declared that:<blockquote>

	Our jurisprudence historically has reflected Western civilization concepts of the family as a unit with broad parental authority over minor children. Our cases have consistently followed that course; our constitutional system long ago rejected any notion that a child is the "mere creature of the state" and, on the contrary, asserted that parents generally "have the right, coupled with the high duty, to recognize and prepare [their children] for additional obligations."

<p>
	The law's concept of the family rests on a presumption that parents possess what a child lacks in maturity, experience, and capacity for judgment required for making life's difficult decisions. More important, historically it has recognized that natural bonds of affection lead parents to act in the best interest of their children.

	<p>
	That some parents "may at times be working against the interest of their child"... creates a bias for caution, but is hardly a reason to discard wholesale those pages of human experience that teach that parents generally do act in the child's best interest. The statist notion that governmental power should supersede parental authority in all cases because some parents abuse and neglect children is repugnant to American tradition.<sup>18</sup>

	<p>
	[P]arents and guardians, as part of their liberty, might direct the education of children by selecting reputable teachers and places.
<p>
	The fundamental theory of liberty upon which all governments in this Union repose excludes any general power of the state to standardize its children by forcing them to accept instruction from public teachers only. The child is not a mere creature of the state; those who nurture him and direct his destiny have the right, coupled with the high duty, to recognize and prepare him for additional obligations.<sup>19</sup>
<p>
	Simply because the decision of the parent is not agreeable to the child or because it involves risks does not automatically transfer the power to make that decision from the parents to some agency or officer of the state.... Most children, even in adolescence, simply are not able to make sound judgments concerning many decisions, including their need for medical care or treatment. Parents can and must make those judgments.<sup>20</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In 1972, the Supreme Court summed up its intent in these earlier rulings: "The primary role of the parents in the upbringing of their children is now established beyond debate as an enduring American tradition."<sup>21</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

While parental rights are fundamental, however, they are not absolute. The Supreme Court has ruled repeatedly that states have the right to regulate the activities of family life for reasons of compelling state interest. Nonetheless, this governmental right is not unlimited. As the Court found in 1972, for example, "The state's interest in universal education, however highly we rank it, is not totally free from a balancing process when it impinges on fundamental rights and interests."<sup>22</sup>
<p>

<b>Complementary Roles of Congress and the Supreme Court</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Fundamental rights under the U.S. Constitution are the domain of the federal government because they regulate the relationship between government -- all government -- and the citizen. Clarity on these rights results from their being spelled out in the Constitution, in Supreme Court rulings, in legislation passed by Congress, or in some combination of the work of these two branches of the federal government.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Redundancy of affirmation of fundamental rights is frequent between Congress and the Supreme Court. This has been the case in the last few decades, for instance, with the right to freedom from racial discrimination. There is a rich history of such clarification underlying the fundamental rights of U.S. citizens. At times, the Supreme Court will correct Congress, as it did in <I>Brown v. Board of Education</I> in 1954, clarifying the right to segregation-free education.<sup>23</sup>  At other times, Congress will correct the Supreme Court, as it did with the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, clarifying the right to freedom of religious practice.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Congress's responsibility to enforce the protection of fundamental rights is described in the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution:<blockquote>

	No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law.... <sup>24</sup>
<p>
	The Congress shall have the power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.<sup>25</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In the event of confusion over the nature of fundamental rights, it is the federal government's responsibility to clarify or protect them. Congress did this with the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the Supreme Court did so in <I>Brown v Board of Education</I> in 1954. Both Congress and the Court also may act if one state upholds fundamental rights and another denies them (as happened in certain states which persisted in countenancing racial discrimination). With the Parental Rights and Responsibility Act of 1995, Congress would assume this task with respect to parents' rights.
<p>

<b>THE NEED TO RESTORE THE PRIMACY OF THE FAMILY</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The family is the indispensable institution of civil society; for it is the family that is primarily competent and responsible for developing the good character of children. When families are strong and function well, their children grow into adults who are truthful and responsible, and who practice private virtue and public citizenship. When families falter, their children grow into adults who can be vicious and irresponsible. Thus, because a free and civil society depends so utterly on the work of families, individuals take on extraordinary responsibilities when they become parents. As the bipartisan National Commission on Children observed in its final report in 1991:
<blockquote>
	The family is and should remain society's primary institution for bringing children into the world and for supporting their growth and development throughout childhood.... Parents are the world's greatest experts on their own children. They are their children's first and most important caregivers, teachers, and providers. Parents are irreplaceable, and they should be respected and applauded by all parts of society for the work they do.<sup>26</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

As Urie Bronfenbrenner, professor of child psychology at Cornell University, has explained:
<blockquote>
	In order to develop -- intellectually, emotionally, socially, and morally -- a child requires participation in progressively more complex reciprocal activity, on a regular basis over an extended period in the child's life, with one or more persons with whom the child develops a strong, mutual, irrational emotional attachment and who is committed to the child's well-being and development, preferably for life.<sup>27</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

It is parents -- not teachers, child care providers, social workers, or a "village" -- that are most likely to give this all-encompassing commitment to the welfare of the child. This is not to denigrate the important work done by teachers, child care providers, and social workers, but simply to acknowledge an important truth: Only parents can reasonably be expected to put the interests of their children above their own. Thus, government must assume that parents, not bureaucrats or politicians, are in the best position to make decisions about their children because only parents can be expected to have this overriding commitment to their children's welfare.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

This does not mean that all parents will put their children's interests above their own at all times. Indeed, some parents -- especially those who are under the influence of drugs like crack cocaine or alcohol -- even abuse their children physically or sexually. In such cases, the state can act to curtail the right of an individual parent or couple to care for a child. But the state can never lawfully curtail the fundamental rights of parents as a class; its duty is to uphold these rights. In all areas of public policy, government should assume that because parents are best able to make decisions about the welfare of their children, they must retain the maximum decision-making authority when it comes to raising those children. This is the underlying assumption of the Parents' Rights and Responsibilities Act of 1995.

<p>
<b>WHY PARENTS' RIGHTS NEED TO BE CODIFIED</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There are four reasons for codifying parental rights in law, even though the Supreme Court has ruled clearly on the issue in the past. First, certain legislatures have transgressed against parents. Second, there is evidence that these rights have been violated in the courts at lower federal and state levels. Third, state government agency actions sometimes violate these rights. Fourth, an increasing hostility to the fundamental rights of parents is evident in the activities of certain prominent members of the very "humane professions" (education, law, medicine, social work, and psychology) that are supposed to aid parents in the work of raising children.<ol>

<p><li><b>Legislative Threats.</b> State legislators have encroached on parents' rights. Though the courts or the people eventually have repelled these attacks, the very fact that such rights are subject to assault illustrates the danger. A few examples:<ul>

<p><li><b>Oregon.</b> In the 1920s, when the state of Oregon passed a law banning private schools, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the fundamental right of parents to choose the type of education they desire for their children:
<blockquote>
The fundamental theory of liberty upon which all governments in this Union repose excludes any general power of the state to standardize its children by forcing them to accept instruction from public teachers only. The child is not a mere creature of the state; those who nurture him and direct his destiny have the right, coupled with the high duty, to recognize and prepare him for additional obligations.<sup>28</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Nevertheless, a whole state government, including both chambers of the legislature, the governor, and the state judiciary, had attempted to violate the fundamental rights of parents as a group.

<p><li><b>Utah.</b> In 1980, the Utah legislature, with the governor concurring, passed an Amendment to the Children's Rights Act which changed the test by which parents could be denied the right to custody of their child. The old criterion of "unfit or incompetent" was supplanted by a new one: "the best interest of the child."  In 1982, however, the Utah Supreme Court rejected the new criterion because it would have allowed the state rather than the parent to determine what constitutes a child's "best interest":
<blockquote>
	[T]he 1980 amendment did not merely <I>refine or elaborate</I> the requirement that the parent be found "unfit or incompetent" in order to terminate his or her parental rights. Instead it <I>replaced</I> that subsection, and in doing so deleted a statutory protection for the parental rights of fit parents.... 
<p>
	No court is warranted in applying the "polar star [guiding] principle" of the welfare of the infant until the natural parents' rights have been lawfully severed and terminated.... 
<p>
	We are not aware that this Court has ever espoused the view, and it is not our view, that the termination of parental rights can be decreed without giving serious consideration to the prior and fundamental right of a parent to rear his child; and concomitantly, of the right of the child to be reared by his natural parent.<sup>29</sup>
</blockquote><p>
<li><b>The U.S. Congress.</b> In February 1994, Representative George Miller (D-CA), long-standing chairman of the House Select Committee on Children, Youth, and Families, introduced an amendment to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (H.R. 6) that would have required a home schooling parent to be teacher-certified in any subject before being able to teach that subject to his or her child. This measure would have deprived parents of the hard-won recognition of their freedom to educate their children at home. Once the legislative threat became known, constituent phone calls to Congress reached historic levels,<sup>30</sup> illustrating the growing level of parental sensitivity to such encroachments. Thanks in large part to this public outrage, the Miller amendment failed by a vote of 382 to 53.
</ul><p>
<li><b>Judicial Threats.</b> Parental rights also have been threatened by the courts.
<ul>
<p><li><b>Massachusetts.</b> In 1995, the Supreme Court of Massachusetts affirmed the decision of the School Board of Falmouth to deny parents the ability to "opt out" of sex education classes and condom distribution for their children. The court further claimed that the freedom of parents was not violated because the children were not forced to take the condoms, the parents were free to tell their children to avoid the classes in question, and the children were free to avoid the classes if they chose.<sup>31</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The parents contended that the most critical and powerful element was missing from this formulation: the requirement that schools honor the parents' right to "opt out" even when their children did not want to do so. Thus, the ruling struck directly at parental authority. The court contended that the parents failed to demonstrate how their interests as parents were burdened by the school's condom or sex education programs. In other words, the state does not have to demonstrate "compelling state interest" when it decides to override the fundamental rights of parents; parents have to demonstrate unconstitutional interference by the state. The state is assumed to possess superior authority to direct the education and health of the child unless the parents can demonstrate otherwise.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

This ruling directly contradicts many other state court rulings on the same issue.<sup>32</sup>  Massachusetts parents thus do not have parental rights that are recognized in other states.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In another notable case, the Massachusetts Supreme Court moved against parents who sought advance notification from the school so that they could exercise the "opt-out" provision.<sup>33</sup>  They contended that there was not much point in being able to "opt out" if they learned of the need only after the damage had taken place -- in this case, an AIDS awareness program conducted for the children by an outside consulting firm, "Hot, Sexy and Safer Productions Inc.," which included demonstrating the use of condoms and discussing many sexual acts traditionally regarded by parents as perverse and immoral.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Both the federal district court and the federal circuit court found the Massachusetts parents' case to be without standing, and the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear the case. As a result, Massachusetts parents have no recourse from rulings of the Massachusetts Supreme Court. Both state and federal courts, in effect, have denied the existence of the parents' fundamental rights, and there is no legal procedure by which these parents can protect themselves from this violation.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Both of these rulings illustrate the need for Congress to clarify a right deemed fundamental in many states but not in all.


<p><li><b>Michigan.</b> In 1993, the Michigan Supreme Court issued two rulings on home schooling which illustrate that court's confusion with regard to parents' rights in education. According to the first, a set of parents has the right to home school their children because of their religious beliefs.<sup>34</sup>  But according to the second, another set of parents does not have the same freedom because, not claiming religious liberty principles, their rights to educate their children are controlled by the state of Michigan.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In denying the "secular parents" their right to direct their children's education, the Michigan Supreme Court held "that a parent's Fourteenth Amendment right to direct a child's education is not one of those rights described by the United States Supreme Court as fundamental, and, thus, the strict scrutiny test is unwarranted."<sup>35</sup>  Thus, "religious" Michigan parents have a freedom to direct the education of their children that "secular" Michigan parents do not have. Michigan appears to have established a religious test for home schooling.

<p><li><b>Washington.<sup>36</sup></b> In 1980, the Supreme Court of the State of Washington ruled that it was not a violation of parents' rights to remove an eighth grade girl from her family. The parents had grounded her because she wanted to smoke marijuana and sleep with her boyfriend. She did not like her parents' rules, even though they were reasonably enforced, and asked the local child welfare agency to place her elsewhere.<sup>37</sup>  Rather than back the parents as the best way to correct the child's behavior, this agency honored the child's request that she be placed in someone else's home. One of the dissenting judges in the case described the situation:
<blockquote>
	They [the parents] asked their 15-year-old daughter not to use drugs, or associate with those who had furnished drugs, that she not use alcohol, that she not be sexually active, and that she be in at a reasonable hour. Because of the daughter's unwillingness to follow these obviously reasonable standards, these parents are summarily deprived of custody and the best opportunity to resolve these problems within the family.<sup>38</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

At no time did the state's lawyers contend that the parents' rules and their enforcement of them were unreasonable. Nor did they argue that the parents abused or neglected the child. The child simply wanted to avoid these restrictions, and the local child welfare agency and the courts backed her rather than her parents. Subsequently, the child's teenage and early adult years were extraordinarily troubled. Now an adult and mother herself, she sees the wisdom of her parents' approach and says that she wishes the local and state authorities had backed them instead of her.<sup>39</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Though the majority of the Washington Supreme Court denied the parents' rights (and in doing so differed clearly from both the Utah Supreme Court and the West Virginia Supreme Court), the three dissenting judges wrote:
<blockquote>
	There is no claim or proof [by the state] of unfitness or neglect by the parents. There was no claim of proof of any imminent threat of harm or danger to this 15-year-old.... Petitioning juvenile was asked at the court hearing the following: Q. "Could you please tell us why you believe there is a conflict in that home?"  A. "I just feel that there's a communication gap there."...  That is the sum and substance of the petitioner's testimony upon which she was taken from her parents' custody over their objections....  The court's justification for this extensive deprivation of fundamental parental rights consisted merely of conclusory findings of fact which met the unconstitutionally vague and inadequate standards of the statute.<sup>40</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Washington court's ruling was possible because of the lack of clear procedural legal guidelines for the denial of parental rights. This would not have happened if the court had been required to use the "compelling interest of the state" standard of review required by the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act now before Congress.
</ul>
<p><li><b>Threats from Boards and Bureaucrats.</b> Perhaps more than anything else, what has made parents increasingly aware of their fundamental rights is the frequent violation of these rights by state and local government officials.<ul>

<p><li><b>New York City.</b> The violation of parental rights can lead to confrontation. In 1992, one such dramatic and widely reported confrontation between parents and education authorities occurred over the teaching of "gay sex" in New York City's proposed "Rainbow Curriculum."  Despite hearings attended by hundreds of parents (and the declared opposition of tens of thousands more), the Board of Education pressed forward with its plans. While the voters ousted the offending board members shortly thereafter, the incident highlighted the depth of opposition to the fundamental right of parents to direct the education of their children, even in the area of intimate family-generating behavior.

<p><li><b>Virginia.</b> Sometimes the irony of this opposition escapes bureaucrats. In 1995, during a debate in Fairfax, Virginia, at a local school board meeting convened to vote on sex education, there was standing room only for parents, most of whom wanted something different from what the board intended to give them. School Superintendent Robert Spillane, annoyed with this supposed parental interference, complained: "You can see why parents should not be involved in family life education."<sup>41</sup>

<p><li><b>Maryland.</b> In 1996, a similar hearing in Montgomery County, Maryland, on the issue of "gay sex" in the public school curriculum evoked similar outrage from parents at open school board meetings. Again, the school board decided to disregard the parents' concern and go forward with the curriculum change. Maryland parents and students are not permitted to "opt out" of sexual education courses.

<p><li><b>Texas.</b> Many officials simply discount parental rights. One recent case involved a disagreement between parents and the Texas Board of Education on parents' access to standardized state test materials. When the lower court ruled in favor of the parents, the Texas Attorney General appealed the ruling. Though many might side with the school board on the particulars of the case, it is disturbing that the State Attorney General based his appeal on a rejection of the fundamental right of parents to direct the education and upbringing of their children.<sup>42</sup>

<P><LI><B>North Carolina.</b> In 1995, the county of Durham, North Carolina, drew up its own guidelines for judging the presence of child abuse. Though most of these "Minimum Standards of Care" make sense as indicators of potential child abuse, a number of them indicate a dangerous overreach by bureaucrats, who can claim authority to come into any home to check the suitability of parents. For instance, a parent may be investigated for "child abuse" if he confines a child to his room or violates any of a number of detailed government standards governing the supervision, nutrition, clothing, cleanliness, and even the bedtime of children. According to the Durham County Department of Social Services:
<blockquote>
 	The document reflects, to the extent possible under state law, the standards of care which the Durham community deems to be minimally acceptable for its children....  The period of supervision (baby-sitting by minors) must not extend beyond a reasonable bedtime: 9:00 p.m. for 12-14 year olds and midnight for 15-17 year olds.... Parent or caretaker insures proper hygiene by providing care, instruction, or necessary items for cleanliness (water, soap, toothbrush etc.).<sup>43</sup>
</blockquote>
These guidelines, undoubtedly drafted with the best of liberal intentions by the Department of Social Services, nonetheless reflect a desire to police parents. They are an excellent illustration of a trend described by Dr. Ed Zigler, Professor of Developmental Psychology at Yale University: the growing tendency to classify parental behaviors as abusive. "It's a terrible problem," says Professor Zigler. "I see an expansion of parental behaviors that are classified as abuse....  The whole area has become too subjective."<sup>44</sup>
</ul>
<p><li><b>Threats from Professionals.</b> Within the major professions of education, medicine, psychology, social work, and school counseling, there is increasing evidence that too many people and associations think they are more qualified than parents to judge what is good for particular children. There also is increasing evidence that they assume their professional judgment is superior and therefore can be exercised independently of parental judgment.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The conception of the relationship between state and family held by many professionals is wholly unlike that held by most parents. The big contest is over the sexual morality of children. The work of Stanley Rothman and Richard Lerner, professors of sociology at Smith College and experts on the sociology of America's elites, points to a vast difference on matters related to sexual morality. Aside from wide discrepancies over the morality of abortion, Rothman and Lerner find "very large differences in the two groups' views regarding homosexuality, extra-marital and premarital sex, divorce, the ideal number of children in a family, voluntary suicide, and euthanasia."<sup>45</sup>  Differences between the therapeutic professions and the general population likewise are often stark. For instance, 72 percent of people generally describe religion as the most important influence in their lives,<sup>46</sup> while religion is much less important in the lives of the "mental health" elites.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In effect, the divisive politics of "family values" is basically a contest between most Americans and a relatively small elite whose members, because their ideology is estranged from the views of Americans generally, do not want parents to have the legal power to resist their attempts to impose on America's children a set of beliefs sharply different from those of their parents.
<ul>
<p><li><b>Medicine.</b> In East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, about 60 girls recently underwent a physical examination, including examination of the genitalia by a school nurse and doctor, without the permission of many of their parents. All the girls were 11 and 12 years old. Several objected, some started crying, and others asked to inform their parents. One of the girls said, "We tried to get out the windows but they pulled us back."<sup>47</sup>  Parents, understandably, were outraged.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Instead of operating according to a straightforward policy of obtaining written parental consent, the school simply assumed the right to conduct invasive medical examinations as long as there was nothing in writing to the contrary. And instead of seeing themselves as assisting parents in the work of raising children, school officials saw themselves as the locus of primary responsibility for the medical examination of other people's children. Rather than live by the Supreme Court's ruling that parents have the fundamental right to direct the upbringing of their children, these officials apparently assumed the right was theirs. Pennsylvania law protects the school in its conduct of these examinations. In New York, however, a state health education teacher, contrasting the East Stroudsburg incident with practices in her school, said, "No child is ever touched without a permission slip. How dare they do this."<sup>48</sup>

<p><li><b>School Counseling.</b> Under the code of conduct for professional psychologists, those in private practice may not offer mental health services without the prior, informed consent of the child's parents.<sup>49</sup>  The law in this instance recognizes that no matter how much training a psychologist may have, he cannot substitute his judgment, arbitrarily and presumptively, for that of the child's parents. But school counselors have a very different situation: "The authors are not aware of any state or federal statutes requiring school counselors to obtain parent permission to counsel minors of any age.... "<sup>50</sup>

<p><li><b>Librarians.</b> By the nature of its work, the American Library Association is in the forefront in educating children. But the Association apparently sees the need to protect children from parents as a group, and stands firmly against parents' rights to direct the education of their children. Consider the following extract from the "ALA's Library Bill of Rights" discussing R-rated and X-rated videos:<blockquote>

Policies which set minimum age limits for access to videotapes... with or without parental permission, abridge library use for minors. MPAA [Motion Picture Association of America] and other rating services are private advisory codes and have no legal standings.... [T]o attempt to enforce such ratings through circulation policies or other procedures constitutes labeling, "an attempt to prejudice attitudes" about the material, and is unacceptable.<sup>51</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In some states, officials also have moved to undermine the right of parents to monitor and control their children's reading material. If a child has a library card, the state forbids library staff to answer parents' questions on what books their children have taken out of the library, no matter what the child's age. For example, Maryland state law declares that "a custodian shall prohibit inspection, use, or disclosure of a circulation record of a public library or other item, collection, or grouping of information about an individual...."<sup>52</sup>  This is reinforced elsewhere in the Maryland code: "a free association, school, college or university library in this State shall prohibit inspection, use or disclosure of any circulation record or other item, collection or grouping of information about an individual...."<sup>53</sup>  The code then lists the exceptions, none of which involves any recognition of the parents' right to direct the education of their minor children.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Safeguarding the confidentiality of library patrons is important to anyone concerned with the rights of individuals. But it is significant that in the development of reading by minors -- an area in which parents are the key players, recognized by the Supreme Court as the agents with the fundamental right to direct the education of their children -- libraries make no accommodation for parents and jealously guard against any parental intrusion. This has led to a bizarre situation in which parents, still financially responsible for books their children lose, are frustrated when they try to learn the names of these books so that they can search for them at home. Maryland public librarians may not tell them. But much more is at stake than this ludicrous inconvenience.

<p><li><b>The Education Establishment.</b> The gradual erosion of parents' standing in the eyes of the nation's powerful educational establishment is already far advanced, notwithstanding Supreme Court rulings to the contrary. Sammy Quintana, President of the National School Boards Association (NSBA), for example, denies the fundamental right of parents to direct the education of their children:
<blockquote>
	None would argue that active parental involvement in the care, upbringing, and education of our children is the cornerstone of a strong, healthy society....  This legislation could place federal judges in the position of requiring the school district to implement policy in conflict with the state's requirements. This is in direct disregard of the constitutionally recognized education function of the state.<sup>54</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In testimony on the bill before the House Committee on the Judiciary, Vicki Rafel, representing the National Parent Teacher Association, stated the NPTA's views on the relationship between parents, teachers, and other professions with similar bluntness:
<blockquote>
 	These institutions are not just part of a local community. They are also part of a total system of services and accountability that must be intertwined to provide an optimum environment for all children. Decisions affecting children should be made in a collaborative effort involving all the stakeholders including parents, educators, health care givers, and government bodies.<sup>55</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Rafel's testimony is striking because of what it does not affirm:
<blockquote>
	Since parents are their children's first teacher, we believe firmly that parents must be involved in every facet of their children's education. However, both the state and federal governments have responsibilities for the education of children. Parents and schools, working together as partners, make the best decision for children in the field of education.... From constitutional and historical perspectives, the states are primarily responsible for education. Under state laws, local school boards have a central role in providing education services with support from other governments.<sup>56</sup>
<p>
	We do not believe that any one single entity, operating outside of the collaborative framework [federal government, states, local school boards, and parents] can adequately address the educational needs of children.... <sup>57</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In other words, the National School Boards Association believes parents may be "involved" but that government officials enjoy the fundamental rights in education, and the National Parent Teacher Association denies the primary and fundamental right of parents in directing the education of their own children -- part of the same right the Supreme Court has described as "beyond debate as an enduring American tradition."
</ul></ol>
<p>
<b>INTERNATIONAL BUREAUCRATIC INTRUSIVENESS</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

On February 23, 1995, President Clinton signed the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which now awaits the advice and consent of the United States Senate. This Convention states that providing for the well-being of children is primarily the right of government. Article 3 establishes legal opposition between parent and child: "State Parties undertake to ensure the child such protection and care as is necessary for his or her well-being, taking into account the rights and duties of his or her parents, legal guardians, or other individuals legally responsible for him or her, and, to this end, shall take all appropriate legislative and administrative measures."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

With respect to the rights and duties of parents, Article 5 declares that "State Parties shall respect the responsibilities, rights and duties of parents... to provide... appropriate direction and guidance in the exercise by the child of the rights recognized in the present Convention."  In other words, parents have the right to guide their children's exercise of rights enumerated by the Convention. According to Article 3, for example, "The child shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of the child's choice."  In addition, "States recognize the rights of the child to freedom of association and to freedom of peaceful assembly."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The right of a minor to free association makes sense when it has parental sanction. But the universal right to free association outside of parental sanction leaves minor children open to exploitation by others, including those who challenge the right of parents to direct the upbringing of their children. Nowhere in the Convention is the right of the parent to direct such activity acknowledged. To the contrary, Article 15 states: "No restrictions may be placed on the exercise of these rights other than those imposed in conformity with the law and which are necessary in a democratic society in the interest of national security or public safety, public order, the protection of public health or morals or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others."  Thus, under the U.N. Convention, only the state may restrict the right of assembly of minors, as a group or as individuals.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The idea of a child's right to privacy also has merit, especially when threats to this privacy come from outside the home. But given the clear responsibility of parents to direct their children's upbringing, the right to privacy articulated in the Convention is a threat to parental authority. While the overall themes of the Convention and many of its specific articles may be laudable, they are vitiated by the absence of any clear articulation of the rights of parents to direct the upbringing of their children. Worse, the Convention's language gives children a right superior to the rights of their parents: "States Parties [governments and government agencies] shall respect the responsibilities, rights and duties of parents... to provide, in a manner consistent with the evolving capacities of the child, appropriate direction and guidance in the exercise by the child of the rights recognized in the present Convention."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

With its detailed elaboration of the rights of the child, coupled with the absence of any legal protection for the rights of parents against intrusive action by the state in the upbringing of children, the U.N. Convention is incompatible with traditional Western conceptions of the liberty of parents and with the U.S. Supreme Court's settled view of parental rights as "beyond debate."  Worse, the state is the only other entity whose rights are made clearly superior to the domestic life of the family as an institution.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Parents should be very concerned over the dangerously intrusive impact of the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child. The reasons for this concern are indicated by a 1995 evaluation report from the United Nations to the government of Great Britain, a signatory to the Convention:
<blockquote>
	In relation to the implementation of article 12, the Committee is concerned that insufficient attention has been given to the right to the child to express his/her opinion, including in cases where parents in England and Wales have the possibility of withdrawing their children from parts of the sex education programmes in schools. In this as in other decisions, including exclusion from school, the child is not systematically invited to express his/her opinion and those opinions may not be given due weight, as required under article 12 of the Convention.<sup>58</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

While the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act does not specifically address the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child, and Senator Jesse Helms (R-NC), Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, so far has blocked consideration by the Senate, this treaty is nonetheless a significant illustration of the thinking on the family among elites in government and the humane professions.
<p>

<b>QUESTIONS RAISED BY THE BILL
<p>

Q: Would the bill establish a new right?
<p>
A:</b> No. The right of parents to raise their children is not new. It is a basic liberty issue for all parents everywhere, in all times, and under all political conditions and regimes. The Supreme Court affirmed this ancient tradition in the jurisprudence of Western civilization over 70 years ago.
<p>
<b>Q: Would the bill grant ambiguous rights to parents?
<p>
A:</b> No. It denies ambiguous rights to government and to others acting on behalf of government. By applying the "compelling interest" clause to parents' rights, as is done with all other fundamental rights recognized under the Constitution, the bill curtails the ability of government officials to be ambiguous or arbitrary in their dealings with parents. When "overriding" the fundamental rights of parents (as it can, for parents' rights are not absolute), the state must do so in a very narrowly defined and defensible fashion. The same principle holds for all other groups and professions in their relations with parents and children.
<p><b>
Q: Would the bill violate the "rights of the child?"
<p>
A:</b> No. The rights of children and parents are complementary. Children have the right to be formed as competent human beings by those who brought them into the world, and parents have the right to develop these capacities in their children. Parents give their children life and continue to influence the development of their children's individuality through their actions as parents. In developing this individuality, which includes intellectual and moral capacities, parents are fulfilling natural rights and responsibilities that not only are an essential component of the Western concept of the individual liberty of the parent, but also are recognized as fundamental under the federal Constitution. Parental exercise of these rights does not violate the child's rights; it fulfills them.
<p><B>
Q: Would the bill eliminate the "best interest of the child" criterion in public policy?
<p>
A:</b> No. It would make the parent the arbiter of the child's best interest. This also is the position of the United States Supreme Court. The community can affect parents' conception of what is in their children's best interest, but children are the progeny of their parents, brought into existence by them, and naturally subject to the parent's conception of what is in their best interest.
<p><b>
Q: Would the bill breach the confidentiality of professional counseling relationship in school settings?

A:</b> No. There is a difference between establishing a professional-minor relationship and preserving the confidentiality of that relationship once established. The bill would do nothing to alter the confidentiality of professional relationships. Confidentiality is a sine qua non of a therapeutic relationship and is widely understood as such. The bill would clarify the process through which such a confidential relationship is established: No professional could enter into such a relationship with a minor without the express permission of the parent, for it is the parent's right, not the professional's, to decide what is in the best interest of the child. The bill would make no difference to many of the therapeutic professions, including psychology and psychiatry, for this already is their established ethic.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Other professions, however, are less explicit in their ethics or professional guidelines. According to the American Counseling Association's professional code of ethics, "When counseling minors or persons unable to give voluntary informed consent, counselors act in the client's best interest."<sup>59</sup>  By contrast, consider the guideline of the American Psychological Association: "When persons are legally incapable of giving informed consent, psychologists obtain informed permission from a legally authorized person, if such a substitute consent is permitted by law."<sup>60</sup>  There is a very big difference between the two: Psychologists defer to parents as the arbiters of their children's best interests in establishing the relationship; school counselors try to claim that right for themselves.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Parents send their children to school to be taught, not to be counseled one-on-one in private professional settings guarded by the rules of confidentiality, unless these relationships are expressly established in cooperation with the parent. Any relationship with a minor that is guarded by confidentiality should be contingent upon the prior written permission of the parent. The very presence of a confidentiality requirement is a signal that there is a need for the express permission of the parent. Under the laws of certain states, older children who also are unemancipated minors may enter into such confidential relationships without their parents' permission. But state laws often prescribe the ages and describe the situations in which these minors may do so.
<p><b>
Q: Would the bill violate the principle of federalism?
<p>
A:</b> No. The Fourteenth Amendment grants Congress explicit authority to legislate to protect the fundamental rights of citizens. Congress and the Supreme Court are the two venues in which this legal clarification takes place. It cannot be done at the state or local level.
<p><b>
Q: Does the bill not threaten and weaken parental rights by involving Congress and the federal courts in family issues?
<p>
A:</b> No. The liberty of parents increasingly is being violated by government agencies and professions acting under government agency authority and protection. Congress and the Supreme Court are the only two institutions which can articulate parental rights in ways that bind all levels of government. Moreover, Congress has the constitutional ability to correct the Supreme Court. Though the Court has articulated parents' fundamental rights, these rights still need to be operationalized by the clear articulation of "compelling interests, narrowly drawn" when the rights of parents are to be set aside. This is not currently the criterion, and its absence is the main reason for the erosion of parents' liberty in the moral formation of their children.
<p><b>
Q: Would this legislation impose an unfunded mandate on the states?
<p>
A:</b> No. Guaranteeing the fundamental rights of citizens is not an unfunded mandate. It is a fundamental duty of each state's judicial system. Section 422 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 states clearly that "this part shall not apply to any provision in a bill, joint resolution, amendment, motion, or conference report before Congress that (1) enforces constitutional rights of individuals...."  Furthermore, the state and its bureaucracies, as the main violators of these rights, can avoid such costs simply by not infringing on the fundamental rights of parents.
<p>
<b>Q: Would codifying the fundamental rights of parents allow parents to sue in both federal and state court systems?
<p>
A:</b> Yes. As a fundamental right, it can be violated at any level, including the federal. Also, violations at the state court level (and there are many instances of these) are properly appealable at the federal court level, as are violations of all other fundamental rights under the federal Constitution.
<p><b>
Q: Would the codification of parents' fundamental rights be a bonanza for trial lawyers?
<p>
A:</b> No. By clearly defining these fundamental rights and establishing a compelling interest test, the bill would reduce the number of cases moving to litigation. It is the absence of this clarity that contributes to the current flood of litigation in local, state, and federal courts.
<p><b>
Q: Would the cost of enforcement be prohibitive?
<p>
A:</b> No. The National Education Association, which openly defends violations of the fundamental rights of parents, says the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act would cost $3.3 billion per year. Even if the NEA's exaggerated estimates were correct, however, such a demand for fiscal conservatism is odd coming from the NEA. According to one recent estimate, the NEA's own legislative agenda would cost the American taxpayer $700 billion.<sup>61</sup>
<p><b>
Q: Could parents use codification to challenge welfare reform?
<p>
A:</b> No. Welfare entitlements are legislative grants, not fundamental individual rights. The state may attach requirements to such grants, but only insofar as they do not violate fundamental rights.
<p><b>
Q: Would the bill permit parents to use child labor to supplement family income?
<p>
A:</b> No. The U.S. Supreme Court has established the right of the state to regulate parents in the matter of child labor, an evil against the child. This bill would do nothing to contravene this state right; nor would it allow parents to deprive their children of the minimum of education required by the state. According to the Supreme Court, "It is cardinal... that the custody, care and nurture of the child reside first with the parents.... [T]he family itself is not beyond regulation in the public interest.... [L]egislation appropriately designed to reach such evils [as child labor] is within the state's police power."<sup>62</sup>
<p>
<b>Q: Would defining parents' fundamental rights hinder states in their task of protecting children from child abuse?
<p>
A:</b> No. No parent has a right to abuse a child. When such abuse happens, the state, acting on the child's behalf, has a duty to protect the child. The truth is that this bill would reinforce the right of states to protect children from abuse. A much greater threat to the state's ability to protect abused children is the "family preservation philosophy" in child care social work, which leads to repeated efforts to reunite the child with an abusive family in the hopes that eventually the parents will improve. By failing to heed the evidence of abuse, this approach frequently places the child in grave danger. In 1992, in New York City, 21 children were killed by a parent or a mother's boyfriend after the Child Welfare Administration had intervened. Both Arizona and Oregon have instituted special units to investigate severe child abuse situations to help the courts move quickly to terminate the parental rights of such abusing parents, and to rescue the children.<sup>63</sup>  This bill would pose no threat to such action by states or local governments, but by the clarity of its statements on child abuse could be cited in support of such actions.
<p><b>
Q: Would codifying the fundamental rights of parents endanger the right of states to guarantee public health by such means as school vaccinations and other public health interventions?
<p>
A:</b> Not at all. The Supreme Court has established the role of the states in safeguarding public health.
<p><b>
Q: Wouldn't people who suspect child abuse be disinclined to report their suspicions?
<p>
A:</b> Far from it. The bill makes clear that no one acting to protect a child from abuse can be subjected to a lawsuit based on such action.
<p><b>
Q: Would parents be able to impede investigations of child abuse by the state?
<p>
A:</b> No. The bill specifically leaves all state child abuse state laws unaffected. The states would retain the duty to protect children who are being abused.
<p><b>
Q: Wouldn't the corporal punishment clause give parents a license to abuse their children or encourage them in the use of abusive punishment?
<p>
A:</b> No. All states currently allow "reasonable corporal discipline," and the Supreme Court has ruled that even school authorities may use "such corporal punishment as is reasonably necessary for the proper education and discipline of the child."<sup>64</sup>  Thus, both state law and the Supreme Court have affirmed that parents and schools may use reasonable corporal punishment.
<p><b>
Q: Would defining fundamental parents' rights overturn state compulsory education laws and prohibit state regulation of home schooling?
<p>
A:</b> No. The Supreme Court has ruled that the state has an interest in establishing compulsory attendance laws and regulating education.<sup>65</sup>  The Court also has stated that parents must demonstrate to the state that their alternative education is appropriate, both in standards of literacy and in terms of the child's eventual self-sufficiency, and has reaffirmed that states may set educational standards for children within their borders.
<p><b>
Q: Would this bill pit school boards and parents against each other?
<p>
A:</b> No. The essence of the American tradition of control by local school boards is to encourage parents to play a full role in the direction of their schools. All this bill would do is create an official atmosphere more sensitive to parents' views. Where these views cannot be accommodated, especially in cases involving sensitive moral issues, parents would have the freedom to withdraw their children from controversial classes.
<p><b>
Q: Would the bill require schools to provide individual tuition or curricula whenever a student's parents disagree with curriculum content?
<p>
A:</b> No. The Supreme Court has ruled that local school boards have the right to set curricula, and the federal courts have held that for the federal judiciary to intervene on behalf of parents, those parents must establish that their constitutional rights have been violated.<sup>66</sup>
<p><b>
Q: Wouldn't the bill require alternative curricula for each race or religion, overturn curriculum decisions, overturn decisions on textbooks, remove free inquiry from the classroom, and forbid mandatory graduation requirements?
<p>
A:</b> No. Establishing the fundamental right of parents to direct the education of their children, as well as their religious and moral formation, does not diminish the right of the community, as represented in its local school board, to act on all these issues. The Supreme Court recognized these local community rights in 1988,<sup>67</sup> affirming the school's right to teach even curricula opposed to the beliefs or values of parents. According to the Court, this does not violate the parents' rights; at the same time, however, for the school board to require the student to act on these values would violate the student's rights.
<p><b>
Q: Wouldn't codifying these fundamental parental rights lead people to use the courts as a solution of first rather than last resort, and cause money to be diverted from the classroom to the courtroom?
<p>
A:</b> No. With the passage of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, religious parents gained the heightened scrutiny standard of "compelling state interest."  Under the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act, all parents would benefit from this standard. There has been no diversion of discussion and energy from classroom to courtroom under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act; rather, official sensitivity and discussion increase when these issues arise. If parents raised ridiculous claims under the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act, their cases would be thrown out of court. The Supreme Court has established school board rights as well. Frivolous litigation would be costly for parents and of no benefit to them.
<p><b>
Q: Would codifying the fundamental rights of parents force local bodies to pay for private or sectarian tuition?
<p>
A:</b> No. Repeated Supreme Court decisions show that the state does not have to pay either for services a person may freely choose in law or for services (such as private education and health care) to which the law may not deny access.
<p><b>
Q: Wouldn't the bill move authority over education to the federal government?
<p>
A:</b> No; quite the opposite. By codifying the fundamental nature of parental rights, it would strengthen the hand of parents in dealing with government, whether federal, state, or local. It also would increase dialogue at the local level and ensure greater sensitivity to parents' rights on the part of government officials.
<p><b>
Q: Does the bill threaten the rights of girls to receive education on contraception and abortion?
<p>
A:</b> Parents have the fundamental right to direct the moral formation of their children. They also have the right to protect their children from behavior that is immoral in their eyes. In a society deeply divided on what is moral and what is immoral, mainly in the area of sexual morality, either school officials would refrain from entering this area of moral teaching (as they do already with respect to religious teaching), or parents would have the clear right to opt out from the official imposition of "values" hostile to their beliefs.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The bill would give parents on both sides of these and other sensitive issues the ability to exercise their right and duty to direct the moral formation of their children as they see fit. Government officials have no right to form moral beliefs in children that contradict the beliefs of parents. According to the Supreme Court government officials are not obliged to teach the sexual morality that parents want taught, but neither do they have any right to teach children a sexual morality opposed to that of their parents.

<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The rights of parents as a group are disregarded or endangered all too frequently by government officials. The Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act would codify a fundamental right already articulated by the Supreme Court. It is needed because of repeated threats to parents' rights from the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government at all levels -- federal, state, and local -- and from the humane professions. The bill is consistent with a tradition of freedom long recognized by the Supreme Court. It also is appropriate to the federal legislative process, because it articulates a fundamental right that applies to all American citizens in relation to all levels of government.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

There has been a disturbing pattern over the past century. Child rearing in America increasingly has come to be viewed as a public matter, a matter for the national "village."  As early as 1901, the Indiana State Supreme Court, in a ruling upholding the state's compulsory education law, stated that "The natural rights of a parent to the custody and control of his children are subordinate to the power of the state."<sup>68</sup>  In 1960, writing in the professional journal <I>Child Welfare</I>, one social worker noted that "daycare can offer something valuable to children because they are separated from their parents."<sup>69</sup>  Today, believing that government is in the best position to ensure the well-being of children, many take it for granted that government should have great authority over their upbringing.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Because of the persistent danger to the fundamental rights of parents from state court rulings, professional associations, government bureaucracies, the educational establishment, and international agencies and bodies, it is clear that these rights need codification in law. The Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act, sponsored by Senator Grassley and Representative Largent, would do just that, erecting a barrier against the mounting erosion of these rights. In an increasingly fragmented and hostile culture, American parents deserve to have their liberty and legitimate rights established as clearly in law as they were in the assumptions of those who founded the American Republic.

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Latin America has bounced back from the economic meltdown caused by the Mexican peso on December 20, 1994, but the United States has not. The democracies of Latin America have stayed on course with free-market reforms, trade liberalization policies, and efforts to create a Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA). However, the U.S. appears to have turned its back on Latin America. As free trade has faded from the foreign policy agendas of both the Clinton Administration and the 104th Congress, U.S. relations with Latin America have deteriorated significantly. On issues such as Cuba, drug trafficking, illegal immigration, and even the creation of the FTAA, America today is increasingly at odds with important hemispheric trading partners such as Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and Colombia.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

America's flight from enlarging the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) has damaged U.S. leadership and economic interests in the Western Hemisphere, but hemispheric trade expansion has not been interrupted. Mexico has signed free trade agreements (FTAs) with Chile, Bolivia, and Costa Rica, is negotiating its association with the South American Common Market (Mercosur),<sup>1</sup> and soon will launch trade negotiations with the European Union. Chile recently became an associate of Mercosur and is negotiating a bilateral FTA with Canada. Other countries interested in joining Mercosur include the five members of the Andean Community.<sup>2</sup>  Mercosur also wants to sign an FTA with the European Union. Clearly, no one is waiting for America to climb back aboard the free trade express in the Western Hemisphere.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

From 1980-1992, the Reagan and Bush Administrations established the closest and strongest relationship with Latin America that the U.S. has enjoyed in more than a century. The bases of this new hemispheric partnership were democracy and the creation of a hemispheric free trade area, as provided for in the Enterprise for the Americas Initiative (EAI) and the NAFTA.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

But since 1993, the Clinton Administration has dissipated the achievements of more than a decade by pursuing a policy of neglect and indifference toward Latin America. Since the collapse of the Mexican peso at the end of 1994, NAFTA has become a political football for politicians who claim that free trade is the cause of such domestic problems as increased drug trafficking and illegal immigration. Instead of responding by making a strong case for NAFTA, however, some previously strong supporters of free trade have scaled back their support for its enlargement, and for the FTAA process in general. America's retreat from NAFTA's expansion is hurting American consumers and workers, undermining U.S. economic interests in Latin America, and weakening U.S. leadership in the Western Hemisphere.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

If this situation is not reversed, U.S. interests in Latin America could suffer lasting damage. To regain America's leading role in the FTAA process and heal the recent rifts in U.S. relations with Latin America, the U.S. Administration should:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Approve a new fast-track negotiating authority.</b> Without fast-track, U.S. participation in and influence at the third post-Summit of the Americas Trade Ministerial, to be held during the second quarter of 1997 in the Brazilian city of Belo Horizonte, will be marginal at best.
<p>
<li><b> Expand NAFTA during 1997 to include Chile.</b> The accession of Chile to NAFTA would reaffirm America's commitment to an FTAA with Latin America and the Caribbean, open a new gateway for U.S. exports in South America and the nations of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC), and provide America with valuable strategic leverage in future convergence talks with Mercosur.
<p>
<li><b>Include the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) countries in NAFTA.</b><sup>3</sup> H.R. 553, stalled in Congress since 1995, would improve market access for U.S. exports to Caribbean and Central American markets. It also would require CBI beneficiaries to strengthen rules relating to investment, labor standards, and the environment, among other improvements that strongly favor U.S. interests.
<p>
<li><b>Launch a dialogue to integrate NAFTA and Mercosur.</b> The goal of such talks should be to deepen and harmonize trade disciplines between NAFTA and Mercosur as both groups take on new members; the ultimate objective should be to merge these two regional groups into a single hemispheric FTAA by 2005.
<p>
<li><b>Define a pathway and timetable for creating the FTAA.</b> Western Hemisphere nations should define quickly whether the FTAA will include commitments that go beyond those already made in NAFTA and the World Trade Organization (WTO). America should insist on FTAA trade disciplines that improve on NAFTA and the WTO.
<p>
<li><b>Implement reforms that do not require negotiations,</b> including unilateral cuts in tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade, simplification and harmonization of existing rules and regulations affecting the flow of goods and services in the region, removal of barriers to trade in services, enactment of world-class protection for intellectual property rights, and revision of investment regulations.
<p>
<li><b>Establish separate negotiations on issues unrelated to free trade,</b> such as drug trafficking, corruption, illegal immigration, labor standards, and preserving the environment. The action plan approved at the Summit of the Americas on December 11, 1994, outlines such a framework; in practice, however, the Clinton Administration has sought consistently to establish conditions and linkages between free trade and other issues. As a result, tensions between the U.S. and Latin America have increased in the past two years, and U.S. leadership and credibility have suffered.
<p>
<li><b>Negotiate FTAs with New Zealand, Singapore, and Australia.</b> The negotiation of bilateral free trade agreements with these countries could create momentum for the convergence of the FTAA and APEC processes into a single free trade area encompassing more than 2 billion consumers.
<p>
<li><b>Convene a second Summit of the Americas in 1997.</b> Strong leadership is required to prevent regionalism from derailing the FTAA process. The goals of a second Summit of the Americas should include creation of a WTO-type entity to advance negotiations, expansion of FTAA technical working groups to propose policies and specific actions, and a commitment by all democracies in the Western Hemisphere to a specific timetable and pathway for launching the FTAA by 2005.
<p>
<li><b>Dismantle domestic U.S. barriers to free trade.</b> U.S. protectionism is the greatest impediment to free trade and creation of an FTAA. Overall, congressionally mandated protection and managed trade policies cost American consumers over $70 billion a year and encourage U.S. trading partners to retaliate with measures that hinder free trade and penalize American consumers and exporters.<sup>4</sup>
</ul><P>

<b>TRADE POLICY BLUNDERS IN LATIN AMERICA</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The greatest failure of U.S. Latin American policy in recent years has been in the area of trade policy. The U.S. no longer leads the Western Hemisphere FTAA process, primarily because the Clinton Administration has chosen to retreat from free trade and NAFTA's enlargement rather than defend the trade pact's record of success. As a result, the FTAA process has lost momentum and the U.S. has surrendered leadership and negotiating advantage to Brazil, which has tilted the FTAA process toward the enlargement of Mercosur into a South American Free Trade Area (SAFTA) centered on Brazil and capable of challenging U.S. economic interests and leadership in the Americas.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This retreat from free trade is severely damaging to U.S. relations with Latin America, not to mention economic and security interests in the Western Hemisphere. Without the goodwill and greater economic interaction that come with increased trade and investment, it will be more difficult for the U.S. and Latin America to develop and implement effective policies for managing such hemispheric problems as drug trafficking, corruption, illegal immigration, and environmental destruction. Moreover, Washington's reluctance to expand NAFTA means that American companies and workers risk missing out on the fast-paced trade expansion occurring today throughout Latin America. Opportunities missed by U.S. companies will be seized by investors from other countries. Exports, jobs, and wealth creation possibilities lost in Latin America by U.S. firms will accrue to others.
<p>

<b>NAFTA: TWO YEARS OF SOLID GROWTH</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Since the peso's collapse on December 20, 1994 -- only nine days after the Summit of the Americas concluded in Miami -- critics of NAFTA have been claiming that the trade pact is a failure. Many critics also blame NAFTA for the growing problems of drugs, illegal immigration, and declining real wages in U.S. manufacturing. But NAFTA did not cause the Mexican peso crisis and is not responsible for America's social problems. Moreover, far from being a failure, NAFTA has scored some impressive trade and investment successes during its first two years.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
NAFTA helped Mexico overcome the peso crisis. The international obligations created by NAFTA and by Mexico's membership in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) enabled the embattled government of Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo to rebuff intense political pressure to roll back Mexico's economic reforms after the peso collapsed. As a result, the Mexican economy now is recovering from the crisis, although years will pass before per capita income returns to pre-peso crisis levels.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

During NAFTA's first two years, trade and foreign direct investment among the U.S., Mexico, and Canada have increased. Since 1994, the average U.S. tariff on Mexican products has fallen from 3.5 percent to 1.5 percent, while average Mexican tariffs on U.S. products have dropped from 10 percent to 4.9 percent. As a result, trade among the three NAFTA countries rose by 17 percent in 1994 to $350 billion, and bilateral U.S.-Mexico trade grew by 20.7 percent, surpassing $100 billion for the first time.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In 1995, despite the recession caused by the peso's collapse, overall U.S.-Mexico trade increased 8 percent to $108 billion, while total intra-NAFTA trade grew 10.6 percent to $380 billion.<sup>5</sup>  Moreover, after declining by 8.9 percent in 1995 to $46.3 billion, U.S. exports to Mexico increased by 12.1 percent during the first three months of 1996, compared with the same period in 1995.<sup>6</sup>  More than 75 percent of all U.S. states reported a rise in exports to Mexico during the first quarter of 1996.<sup>7</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The U.S. trade deficit with Canada and Mexico during 1995 totaled $33.49 billion, compared with a 1994 trade deficit of $14.69 billion with Canada and a trade surplus of $1.34 billion with Mexico. Critics have used these figures to defend their claim that NAFTA is costing jobs in America. The reason Mexico imported fewer U.S. goods in 1995, however, is simply that the peso's collapse reduced the buying power of the Mexican people by more than 50 percent, and poorer people buy fewer goods. Americans consumed more Mexican products in 1995 because the average American is much wealthier than the average Mexican. The truth is that more jobs in America today rely on imports than exports, since nearly 90 percent of American manufacturers utilize imported materials or components in their production.<sup>8</sup>  Moreover, the $80 billion jump in three-way trade during the first two years of NAFTA's implementation added over 1.6 million new jobs to the North American economy.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
NAFTA is restructuring the North American economy as firms in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada create cross-border enterprises that lower manufacturing costs, improve productivity, and expand the volume and diversity of products at lower prices for consumers in all three countries. A recent study by the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) found that half of Mexico's total exports to the U.S. are manufactured by U.S.-owned firms, or by production-sharing partnerships<sup>9</sup> whose products have an average U.S. content of 50.2 percent, compared with 35.3 percent for Canada, 32 percent for Taiwan, and 27.8 percent for Korea. As the output of Mexico-based co-production ventures increases, the volume and value of U.S.-made inputs imported by Mexican firms also increase, creating more jobs in America. Moreover, the rise in U.S.-Mexico co-production ventures is diverting investment away from alternative co-production sites in Asia. In 1994, Mexico was America's largest production-sharing partner, accounting for $22.9 billion, or 39.1 percent of all U.S. co-produced imports.<sup>10</sup>  U.S.-Mexico production partnerships increasingly play a prominent role in such key industries as motor vehicles, auto parts, computers, televisions and other electrical products, and textiles and apparel, among others.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>NAFTA Aiding Mexico's Recovery.</b> Only 18 months after the peso's collapse, the Mexican economy is showing signs of a promising, if uneven, recovery. Following five consecutive quarters of decline, the Mexican economy grew sharply during the second quarter of 1996 as real gross domestic product (GDP) rose 7.2 percent compared with the second quarter of 1995. For all of 1996, Mexico is expected to grow about 3 percent, compared to a contraction of 6.9 percent in 1995.<sup>11</sup>  Moreover, despite a 22 percent rise in the peso against key currencies during the first seven months of 1996, Mexican exports of manufactured goods have gained 22.8 percent, while imports have increased 22.1 percent.<sup>12</sup>  Nevertheless, about 70 percent of all economic activity in Mexico is tied to the domestic economy, which may not feel the overall, export-driven economic upturn for at least another year.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Political and social instability have increased in Mexico as a result of the economic crisis, the spread of drug trafficking, a weak judiciary incapable of fighting corruption, and entrenched political and economic dinosaurs that continue to block democratic reform and true economic freedom. However, NAFTA is not responsible for Mexico's current social and political difficulties. In fact, NAFTA has provided Mexico with a strong anchor and a stable point of institutional reference on the road to true capitalist democracy. Meanwhile, there is reason to be optimistic about Mexico's political future.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Impressive Growth in U.S.-Canada Trade.</b> Canadian exports to the U.S. and Mexico have risen impressively since NAFTA was implemented. Foreign investment in Canada from all sources also has increased significantly. In 1995, two-way trade between the U.S. and Canada grew nearly 12 percent to $272 billion, while total foreign direct investment in Canada increased by 10 percent to $168 billion. The U.S. is the largest foreign investor in Canada. Direct investment in Canada by American firms increased by 11 percent to $113 billion in 1995, representing 67 percent of total foreign direct investment in Canada. Similarly, the U.S. remains the destination for the largest share of Canadian foreign direct investment, with a total of $76.5 billion invested.<sup>13</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Canada's exports in 1994 represented 30.1 percent of its total GDP, compared to 21.6 percent in 1991. Canada's strong export performance during the 1990s was closely related to the growth in Canadian exports to the U.S., and Canadian production of goods for international markets is closely linked to the U.S. through the intra-firm trading of U.S.-controlled firms operating in Canada.<sup>14</sup>  Transactions between related firms account for 57 percent of Canadian exports to the U.S., and 72 percent of exports by U.S.-con-trolled Canadian firms are related-party transactions. According to one survey, "U.S.-controlled [multinational companies] are responsible for the largest share of sales by the Canadian manufacturing and wholesale firms studied, and account for the largest share of their imports and exports."  Overall, the Canadian economy is "linked intra-regionally to the U.S. economy."<sup>15</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>A Hemispheric Free Trade Emporium.</b> When Mexico defaulted on its external debt obligations in 1982, it triggered the Latin American debt crisis and plunged the region into a decade of negative growth and falling per capita income. However, when the Mexican peso collapsed in December 1994, Latin America was hardly affected. Economic growth in Latin America and the Caribbean slowed to 0.8 percent in 1995 as the effects of the Mexican peso crisis rippled through the region's financial markets. However, U.S. exports to Latin America and the Caribbean rose to $102 billion in 1995, up 12 percent from 1994 and 72 percent higher than total U.S. exports to the region in 1990. Although individual countries such as Argentina, Colombia, and Mexico are struggling to resolve diverse economic, political, and social difficulties, the region overall has shrugged off the aftershocks of the Mexican peso crisis.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The World Bank predicts that Latin America and the Caribbean will grow by 3.1 percent in 1996 and 4 percent in 1997, with Chile leading the region at 6.5 percent this year while Venezuela lags at 0.5 percent.<sup>16</sup>  The bank also predicts that average GDP growth should rise to 3.8 percent in 1996-2005, compared to average growth of 2.4 percent during the past decade.<sup>17</sup>  Free trade and foreign direct investment are driving the region's growth. Latin America's exports and imports increased rapidly as tariff barriers dropped from 50 percent a decade ago to 12 percent in 1993, one year before NAFTA went into effect. For years, U.S. exports to Latin America have increased twice as rapidly as exports to any other region of the world. Intra-regional trade between Latin American countries and trade with Asia also are growing rapidly. For example, intra-Mercosur trade doubled in four years to $15.8 billion and today accounts for 22 percent of the group's total world trade, up from 14.3 percent in 1992.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Some World Bank economists believe that Latin America can achieve annual growth rates of 6 to 6.5 percent within a decade if governments in the region raise exports significantly by avoiding overvalued exchange rates; increasing investments for infrastructure such as roads, ports, and telecommunications; and attracting larger amounts of foreign direct investment.<sup>18</sup> However, while democracy, hemispheric economic integration, and trade expansion are progressing rapidly, Latin American and Caribbean countries are still struggling to resolve a host of structural impediments to faster growth and greater stability and economic prosperity. Economic reforms have not advanced sufficiently anywhere in the region, including Chile, which is routinely hailed as Latin America's star performer. The widespread absence of economic freedom is reflected in the region's high levels of poverty, illiteracy, and illegal immigration. Judicial systems are generally weak, politicized, and corrupt. Effective legal protection for individual property rights does not exist. Moreover, drug traffickers have emerged in the 1990s as major threats to the stability of countries such as Colombia and Mexico. Organized violence by subversive guerrilla organizations is increasing in Colombia, Peru, and Mexico.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The difficulties confronting Latin America and the Caribbean today defy easy or quick solutions. They represent both a daunting challenge to the region's expectations for a brighter economic future and a threat to U.S. economic and national security interests. The Enterprise for the Americas Initiative, NAFTA, and Free Trade Area of the Americas were proposed by the U.S. as the foundations of a hemispheric partnership and a new American Century based on democracy, free trade, and the economic integration of the U.S. and Latin America. This vision has not been realized. Nine days after the FTAA was launched at the Summit of the Americas in Miami, the Mexican peso collapsed and the U.S. retreated from NAFTA's enlargement.
<p>
<b>TEN INITIATIVES FOR RESTORING U.S. LEADERSHIP TO THE FREE TRADE AREA OF THE AMERICAS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The failure to enlarge NAFTA to involve Chile and the Caribbean countries during 1995 was a major setback for U.S. economic and security interests in Latin America and the Caribbean. The momentum and direction of the FTAA process have changed significantly since the Mexican peso crisis. Brazil has filled the vacuum in the FTAA process created by America's retreat from free trade, and has won regional support for an alternative trade agenda that sidelines a NAFTA/WTO-plus process to create the FTAA in favor of a more limited regional approach based on the expansion of Mercosur to create a South American Free Trade Area (SAFTA) centered on Brazil. Brazil also favors negotiating a trade pact with the European Union before engaging the U.S. in talks to establish a framework for the future merger of Mercosur and NAFTA into an FTAA.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Although Mercosur has its share of internal problems that could slow its expansion, the process is well underway. Chile has become an associate of Mercosur, and Bolivia, Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador expect to join before the end of 1996. Mexico is negotiating an agreement with Mercosur while simultaneously blocking U.S. and Canadian efforts to launch early talks between NAFTA and Mercosur. The proposed enlargement of Mercosur and creation of a SAFTA appeals to many Latin American politicians, intellectuals, and business leaders who support higher levels of protectionism and the notion of a united Latin American front capable of maintaining its economic and political independence from U.S. pressure and interference. Latin American integration is one of the oldest dreams in the region, and it is closer to being achieved today than ever before. Meanwhile, as the free trade express in Latin America picks up speed, the U.S. lags behind even the caboose.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The new U.S. partnership with Latin America celebrated by President Clinton at the Summit of the Americas has developed serious cracks. For example, entities such as the Rio Group and the Organization of American States (OAS) have condemned the U.S. for enacting the Helms-Burton Act against Cuba and for decertifying Colombia in the war on drugs. U.S. policy against Cuba also has raised tensions significantly with NAFTA partners Mexico and Canada. Mexico has attacked recent changes in U.S. immigration policy. A pattern of mutual recrimination has emerged. The U.S. criticizes Latin America's coddling of Fidel Castro's regime and punishes countries like Colombia and Mexico for not doing enough to control drug trafficking and illegal immigration. Latin American governments criticize what they perceive as the return of U.S. "big stick" unilateralism and feel betrayed by Washington's bipartisan stampede away from NAFTA's expansion and the FTAA process.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Leading by Example.</b> If the U.S. expects Latin America and the Caribbean to cooperate on policy issues viewed as important to U.S. economic and security interests, it must assert its leadership and set the example. Abandoning trade commitments like adding Chile to NAFTA is the antithesis of leadership, and it sets a bad example. Instead of building a bridge to the 21st century that would unite the U.S. and the democracies of the Western Hemisphere, the U.S. retreat from NAFTA's expansion and the U.S. government's managed trade policies have dug a moat between Washington and the rest of the Americas.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To restore American leadership to the FTAA process and repair the recent damage to U.S. relations with Latin America and the Caribbean, the U.S. Administration should carry out the following ten initiatives:
<p><blockquote>
<b>1. Approve a new fast-track negotiating authority.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Without fast-track in hand, the Administration cannot enter into serious trade negotiations with Chile or any other country. Chile has claimed that it will not negotiate its entry into NAFTA until fast-track is renewed. Suggestions that fast-track is not necessary to enter into trade negotiations are mistaken. No country will invest the time or the human and financial resources in negotiating with the U.S. if American negotiators cannot guarantee that any agreement reached will not be mutilated beyond recognition by the U.S. Congress.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Without fast-track, U.S. participation in and influence at the third post-Summit of the Americas Trade Ministerial during the second quarter of 1997 in the Brazilian city of Belo Horizonte will be marginal at best; moreover, U.S. proposals are more likely to be rejected. Symbolically, making renewal of fast-track one of the first actions of a new Administration and Congress would constitute a strong reaffirmation of America's commitment to free trade and would send Latin America a powerful message that the U.S. has re-engaged in the FTAA process. The dynamics of the Belo Horizonte trade ministerial could be altered completely if the U.S. delegation arrives with fast-track negotiating authority. Without fast-track, however, the U.S. risks being left behind again as Brazil's vision of turning Mercosur into a SAFTA stokes the enthusiasm of other Latin American governments.
<p>
<b>2. Expand NAFTA during 1997 to include Chile.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
One of the greatest mistakes made recently by the U.S. in Latin America was postponing the inclusion of Chile in NAFTA until after the 1996 elections. The failure to add Chile to NAFTA weakened American leadership and influence in the FTAA process.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There is no reason to delay the admission of Chile to NAFTA. Chile's total gross national product is equivalent to about 1 percent of the American economy. Chile has enjoyed positive economic growth for 14 consecutive years. Growth during the past six years under a democratic civilian government has averaged 7.5 percent annually. Chile has pre-paid a large chunk of its external public sector debt, has no balance-of-payments problems, and has enjoyed single-digit inflation since 1994. Its investment and savings rates are approaching those of the Asian Tigers. The inclusion of Chile in NAFTA would confirm America's commitment to leading the FTAA process, open a new gateway for U.S. exports to markets in South America and APEC, and provide America with valuable strategic leverage for future convergence talks with Mercosur.
<P>
<b>3. Include the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) countries in NAFTA.</b><sup>19</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
H.R. 553, stalled in Congress since 1995, is intended to correct an imbalance created by NAFTA that directly affects the interests of U.S. producers, importers, retailers, and consumers. The bill was developed to assure "parity" for producers in CBI countries with the market access provided to Mexican producers under the NAFTA. Such parity is badly needed. The Bush and Clinton Administrations mistakenly assumed that NAFTA would not divert trade and investment from the CBI countries. Since the implementation of NAFTA on January 1, 1994, U.S. imports of certain products (such as apparel) produced in the CBI countries by American firms have been affected adversely. The trade advantages created by NAFTA have enhanced the attractiveness of Mexico as a site for investing in manufacturing operations for export to the U.S. As a result, the rate of growth for apparel imports from CBI countries into the U.S. fell from 25 percent during 1995 to about 8 percent for the first five months of 1996, while apparel imports from Mexico during the same five-month period grew by 41 percent.<sup>20</sup>
<p>
<b>4. Launch a dialogue to integrate NAFTA and Mercosur.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The dynamics of the FTAA process have changed. The U.S. has squandered a two-year window of opportunity to influence the timetable and pathway for creating an FTAA, and Mercosur has emerged as a viable alternative pathway to an FTAA that many Latin American countries find appealing. Therefore, NAFTA and Mercosur should engage quickly in a formal dialogue with the goal of deepening and harmonizing trade disciplines as both groups take on new members. The ultimate objective should be to merge the two regional blocs into one hemispheric FTAA by 2005.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Since 1995, the Clinton Administration has been trying without success to establish a formal dialogue between NAFTA and Mercosur. The problem is a series of disagreements among the U.S., Mexico, and Canada.<sup>21</sup>  Mexico opposes a NAFTA-Mercosur dialogue, arguing that it is not needed to achieve an FTAA by 2005 and that NAFTA should focus instead on granting real negotiating powers to the 11 technical work groups involved in the FTAA process.<sup>22</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Canada supports the U.S. proposal for a NAFTA-Mercosur dialogue but is reluctant to proceed without Mexico. The Canadians also oppose creating an FTAA as a pathway to NAFTA-Mercosur convergence by 2005. Instead, the Canadians favor replacing NAFTA and Mercosur with a new agreement negotiated simultaneously by all 34 democracies in the Western Hemisphere. Further complicating matters, enactment of the Helms-Burton Act has divided NAFTA, as Mexico and Canada are bitterly opposed to its implementation. As a result, the U.S. and Brazil announced in late August that an overdue report on the status of their ongoing bilateral trade review would be delayed. Several rounds of technical talks failed to achieve any breakthroughs on bilateral issues, such as improving the implementation of anti-dumping and countervailing duty laws in both countries. In addition, the July 1996 deadline for holding the first formal meeting between NAFTA and Mercosur was missed.
<P>
<b>5. Define a pathway and timetable for creating the FTAA.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The U.S. should urge Western Hemispheric nations to decide quickly whether the FTAA should include commitments that go beyond those already made in NAFTA and the WTO or should be abandoned in favor of merely removing tariffs on goods traded within the region.<sup>23</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Defining the timetable and pathway for the FTAA would advance the regional trade process in three ways: 1) It would focus the efforts of the 11 FTAA working groups set up to prepare for future negotiations; 2) it would help establish priorities for the FTAA agenda; and 3) it would help set a better stage for the difficult negotiations of the details of an FTAA agreement. The U.S., Canada, Mexico, Chile, Colombia, and Costa Rica at various times have supported an FTAA based on WTO-plus disciplines in which, by 2005 when the FTAA is scheduled to go into effect, all of the commitments and trading disciplines established under the WTO would be implemented. However, Brazil has forcefully opposed proposals for an FTAA that goes beyond the WTO.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A fast-track negotiating authority in hand before the third post-Summit of the Americas trade ministerial next year in Brazil would improve the prospects for faster trade liberalization based on NAFTA/WTO-plus trading disciplines. Without fast-track, U.S. hopes of accelerating and enriching the FTAA process may be stillborn at the Belo Horizonte trade ministerial in 1997.
<p>
<b>6. Implement reforms that do not require formal negotiations.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There are many unilateral actions that governments in the Western Hemisphere could take without engaging in formal state-to-state negotiations. Moreover, these reforms could yield swift benefits for both the U.S. and Latin America, since they would improve market access by injecting more transparency into the government rulemaking process and by dismantling tariff and non-tariff barriers to the faster and more efficient movement of goods, services, and capital throughout the region. For example, governments could simplify and harmonize rules and regulations relating to customs practices, sanitary standards, and technical barriers to trade. They also could pledge to avoid imposing new tariff and non-tariff barriers or raising existing barriers to the flow of goods, services, and investment within the region.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A third area in which governments should move quickly is revision of national investment laws to guarantee the right of establishment and national treatment of foreign investors, no restrictions on repatriation of profits and capital and access to convertible currency for all such transactions, protection against expropriation and compensation at fair market value in the event expropriation occurs, and phaseout of all performance requirements. Yet another area in which swift reforms are possible is the enactment of laws and policies that provide world-class protection for patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets. Moreover, barriers to trade in services should be removed quickly, particularly in the areas of finance, telecommunications, and transportation. In addition, governments in Latin America should eliminate requirements and preferences in their purchase of goods and services, reduce market-distorting subsidies, and strengthen national competition laws.<sup>24</sup>  These reforms would accelerate the momentum of the FTAA process and yield tangible benefits in the form of faster trade growth and increased foreign direct investment flows in the Western Hemisphere.
<p>
<b>7. Establish separate negotiations on issues unrelated to free trade.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Both the expansion of NAFTA and U.S. leadership in the FTAA process have been undermined by the Clinton Administration's insistence on linking trade agreements to issues unrelated to free trade, such as labor standards and the environment. The Administration has threatened to impose trade sanctions against Colombia because President Ernesto Samper financed his 1994 election campaign in part with $6 million contributed by the Cali drug cartel. It also has delayed the implementation of a NAFTA obligation to allow Mexican trucks to circulate freely in the American Southwest, alleging concern about drug trafficking and U.S. national security.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
However, while hemispheric negotiations may be required to find common solutions to problems such as drug trafficking, illegal immigration, the environment, and labor standards, such pressure tactics work against U.S. interests in the region. Trade sanctions generally are not effective. Moreover, Latin American governments are unwilling to accommodate the Clinton Administration's demands for labor and environmental linkages to trade agreements; as a result, they will likely seek alternatives to NAFTA, such as Mercosur, SAFTA, the European Union, and Asian countries like Japan and Korea.
<p>
<b>8. Negotiate FTAs with New Zealand, Singapore, and Australia.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Many free traders believe that the pathways followed in creating the FTAA do not matter as long as a hemispheric free trade area is up and running by 2005. However, the recent breakup of the FTAA process into smaller regional trade agreements such as NAFTA and Mercosur is not a positive development. Smaller regional trade agreements may encourage increased trade and investment among the respective members of each group, but higher external tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade with countries that are not members of these groups hinder the efficient global movement of goods, services, and capital. The U.S. should refocus on multilateral trade liberalization and use regional free trade areas such as NAFTA to spur even larger trade zones. Negotiating bilateral NAFTA/WTO-plus trade agreements with Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore could energize the FTAA process, spur faster progress in APEC, and create momentum for merging the FTAA and APEC into a single free trade area.
<p>
<b>9. Convene a second Summit of the Americas in 1997.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A second Summit of the Americas should be convened in Chile in December 1997 to put the FTAA process back on a fast track to completion by 2005. However, before the second summit is held, the U.S. should renew fast-track, Chile should be included in NAFTA, and the CBI countries should be granted trading parity with NAFTA members. At this summit, the leaders of the hemisphere's democracies should agree on three things: 1) a specific pathway and timetable for achieving an FTAA; 2) creation of an institutional entity similar to the WTO to coordinate the FTAA negotiations; and 3) empowering the 11 technical working groups to negotiate firm FTAA proposals related to their respective areas of responsibility. In addition, APEC countries should be invited to participate as observers.

<b>10. Dismantle domestic U.S. barriers to free trade.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The greatest impediments to free trade and creation of the FTAA are found in Washington. For decades, the federal government has operated a vast and complex protectionist machine that has cost American taxpayers and consumers hundreds of billions of dollars. This protectionism comes in many forms, including traditional tariffs, quotas, "voluntary" restraint agreements, orderly marketing agreements, antidumping duties, countervailing duties, tax regulations, technology controls, anti-trust laws, and many other anti-trade weapons used against foreign exporters seeking greater access to the U.S. market as well as American firms and investors trying to compete globally.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Instead of protecting American consumers, preserving jobs, strengthening American manufacturing, encouraging new technology development, and improving American competitiveness in the global economy, this protectionism weakens U.S. companies in the international marketplace, promotes investment in noncompetitive sectors, enshrines low-skilled workers, and hinders productivity growth. American consumers pay a high price for these misguided policies. For example, the Federal Reserve Bank has estimated that import-protection schemes amount to the equivalent of a 23 percent income tax surcharge for low-income American families, or 10 percent for the average family. The Federal Trade Commission has determined that it costs the U.S. economy nearly $90 for each dollar saved by protected American firms. Overall, congressionally mandated protection and managed trade policies cost American consumers at least $70 billion a year and encourage America's trading partners to retaliate in kind, especially in the areas of anti-dumping and countervailing duty legislation.<sup>25</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Since 1993, the Clinton Administration has preached the gospel of free trade in international forums such as the WTO, APEC, and the FTAA. In practice, however, the Administration's "strategic trade policies" have laid the foundations for even greater U.S. government protectionism and interference in the economy. For example, the Administration's National Export Strategy<sup>26</sup> and Big Emerging Markets (BEMs) Initiative<sup>27</sup> outline the twin pillars of an industrial policy and an expanded federal government role in the international marketplace. The basic premise of these strategies is that "U.S. firms will need the U.S. government at their side to win a fair hearing" in the global marketplace.<sup>28</sup>  According to President Clinton, the BEMs Initiative "streamlines Administration resources to focus on the markets in which government involvement can truly make a difference for America's businesses and workers."<sup>29</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Where trade policy is concerned, the Clinton Administration is making big government even bigger. The Administration has targeted domestic "clusters" of high-technology industries for export to key foreign markets where the U.S. government can help American firms secure market access, obtain financing, and win contracts for major projects in which foreign governments help competing bidders or play an important decisionmaking role in awarding projects.<sup>30</sup>  In addition, the Administration has established new divisions at the International Trade Administration and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative to monitor and enforce foreign compliance with U.S. trade laws and agreements.<sup>31</sup>  The Administration also wants other trading nations to adopt a core set of labor principles as part of any future trade liberalization, and continues to insist that any new fast-track negotiating authority must contain strong negotiation provisions on both labor and the environment even though Latin American governments have strenuously opposed such linkages.
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The U.S. has lost its once-respected leadership role in Latin America. The Clinton Administration turned its back on Latin America when the Mexican peso tumbled in December 1994. The expansion of NAFTA has stalled, and the U.S. no longer leads the FTAA process. Although Latin America has recovered from the aftershocks of the peso crisis and trade expansion continues unabated throughout the Western Hemisphere, the Clinton Administration and many in Congress are reluctant to put the expansion of NAFTA back on a fast track. Instead, they are behaving as though the American economy ends at the Atlantic and Pacific continental shelves, with nothing beyond the continent but an economic void that threatens America.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
From 1980-1992, the Reagan and Bush Administrations forged the closest friendship with Latin America that the U.S. has ever enjoyed. However, it took the Clinton Administration less than three years to dissolve that exciting new relationship in acrimonious recriminations and unkept American promises. If the Administration does not halt its flight from free trade and the expansion of NAFTA, U.S. economic and security interests in the Americas could suffer a sustained decline.

When Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn addressed the graduates of Harvard on the eighth of June, 1978, they gathered in anticipation of an extraordinary event.  But in his remarks, which he called <I>A World Split Apart</I>, Solzhenitsyn eschewed the kind of fulsome compliments now endemic in commencement speeches.  Instead, taking advantage of the fact that Harvard's motto is "Veritas," he ventured to tell them the truth:  that "a decline in courage may be the most striking feature that an outside observer notices in the West today."  Speaking barely three years after the fall of Saigon, he observed in Americans something approaching "a lack of manhood" in acquiescing in communist aggression, a trend he found most pronounced "among the ruling and intellectual elites."
<p>
Solzhenitsyn's speech, which might have been an opening wedge into closed minds, only made some Americans stamp their feet in irritation.  It was much easier to conclude that he was wrong than to admit that we had abandoned Vietnam because of our own cowardice.  So his speech provoked a firestorm of condemnation in the media, led by First Lady Rosalynn Carter, who claimed that the Russian writer had no understanding of the United States.
<p>
Though Solzhenitsyn, who had braved the death camps of the Gulag Archipelago and the interrogations of the Soviet secret police in his quest for the truth, hardly needed to burnish his character as a brave man by speaking the truth in Harvard Yard, the speech did prove to be the turning point in his public reputation in this country.  Because of his many unfashionable conclusions, the mainstream media decided that he was a crank, so the man who had been lionized in American literary circles was thenceforth shut out, dismissed, and ignored.  A host of ignorant charges were made against him, while his message to Americans was buried and forgotten.  Harper and Row, which published the address in a little book with the Russian text on one side and the English translation on the other, allowed it to go out of print by the late 1980s.
<p>
The antipathy of the media toward Solzhenitsyn was long-lasting and still has not let up.  When he returned to Russia in 1994, they hastened to conclude that he was just as irrelevant in his own country as they had deemed him to be in ours.  As <I>A World Split Apart</I> makes clear in its lucid discussion of the media in Western countries, they are not open to unfashionable arguments.  Their reaction to the speech was predictable, and in effect Solzhenitsyn's speech predicts it, at least in broad outline.  Thus, the speech was more than a reproach, from a friendly but frank observer, of America's loss of courage:  It was a demonstration of courage by the Russian writer, whose speech was also a deed.
<p>
Solzhenitsyn's example of courage in the speech had a practical effect.  The complacency of the media was not the only opinion abroad in the land.  Among American students of foreign affairs, and also the general public, there was a widespread and justified apprehension by the late 1970s that our loss of courage had left the United States at risk.  The war in Afghanistan, pursued in sharp contrast with the former caution of the Soviet Union, was one sign of danger; another was the impudent seizure of American hostages by the Iranian revolutionaries.  The 1980 presidential election, which turned on the difference between these two opinions about America's place in the world, marked an important turn in our politics.
<p>
In the decade after Solzhenitsyn spoke, American courage played a vital part in the collapse of the Soviet Union -- the most astonishing political event in the lifetime of my generation.  The stiffening of American resolve after the humiliations of the 1970s had many manifestations, but it was personified in the presidency of Ronald Reagan, whom Solzhenitsyn publicly praised.  From the beginning of his administration, Reagan showed courage unknown to his predecessor.  His prompt decision to fire air traffic controllers engaged in an illegal strike caused Americans and foreigners alike to take notice.  Even more important was the way he acted when he was shot in the spring of 1981:  We saw courage in his jokes, and nothing made him more formidable.  His subsequent willingness to call the Soviet Union an "evil empire" instead of falling back on the usual diplomatic euphemisms, and his evident resolve to prevent that country from achieving worldwide hegemony, made a deep impression on his countrymen, on their allies, and also on the Soviets.
<p>
By the time Solzhenitsyn returned to Russia, of course, the "world split apart" that he had described in his speech had been transformed by the American victory in the Cold War, which culminated in the fall of the Soviet Union.  The tense bipolar world of two superpowers, each representing a different moral and political understanding of man, had been replaced by the uneasy -- and sometimes unacknowledged -- triumph of liberal democracy.  Russia returned to the sort of remedial aspiration for democracy that held sway before its government was hijacked by communists during the Great War, while the United States greeted its own dominance with the sort of absentminded modesty that comes over it when it is not at war.
<p>
The sudden demise of the Soviet Union, like the fall of Saigon, was only the culmination of a long series of events, many of them little noticed or understood at the time.  The Soviet Union fell after its rulers realized that communism, which always left the Russian empire at a moral and economic disadvantage, could not keep up with technological progress in the free nations of the world.  That realization, which became widespread among well-placed Russians in the 1980s, made them lose heart about continuing their long-standing war of nerves with the United States.
<p>
It is not given to human beings to know the future, so we cannot be sure that the changes in the Soviet Union are irreversible, dramatic as their effects already have been in many parts of the world.  Powerful politicians who cleave to communism and prefer the old regime now control important offices in Russia and are bidding for the presidency.  The picture also is mixed in many of the former Soviet satellites in Eastern Europe.  Cuba and North Korea remain unbending, though increasingly isolated in their backwardness.  China and Vietnam have begun to modernize their economies by taking some small steps toward a free market, but without dismantling communist tyranny.  In China's case, the transition has been accompanied by an unwelcome belligerency toward the interests and friends of the United States.  Therefore, the post-Cold War world calls for continuing resolve and prudence on our part, not relaxation or inattention.
<p>
But there is plenty of evidence in <I>A World Split Apart</I> -- and much more in Solzhenitsyn's other writings on human nature and politics -- that the Russian writer considers courage important not only as an aid to preserving a decent regime, which it has been for the United States, but also as a virtue that belongs to a properly ordered human soul.  Thus, courage is prized for its own sake as well as for its instrumental effects.  When Solzhenitsyn reproached us for losing heart, he meant to make us ashamed, not just afraid.
<p>
What is courage?  Ernest Hemingway described it as "grace under pressure."  John Milton wrote that a man who had it would "never...  submit or yield."  Solzhenitsyn's predecessor as an honorary American citizen, Winston Churchill, esteemed it "the first of human qualities" -- in fact, the one that guarantees all the others.  In his youth, he sought to win a reputation for courage.  He tells us in his autobiography <I>My Early Life</I> how, after he left the military academy at Sandhurst, he carried out a private experiment by attaching himself to a Spanish column fighting a guerrilla war in Cuba.  Before he got too far into his career as a cavalry officer, he wanted to find out if he had courage enough.  On his 21st birthday, he came under fire for the first time and was relieved to discover that not everyone gets killed, or even hurt.  The young Churchill escaped unscathed, thanks to a well-fed Spanish officer who was asleep in a hammock between him and the enemy guns.  He did not begrudge the fat man his meals.  Keeping the example of his unofficial trial of courage in Cuba in mind, we can discern a few capital facts about it.
<p>
Courage has to do with braving dangers nobly.  It means surmounting the fear of wounds or death.  In his autobiography, Churchill tells us how he gave up a piece of skin from his forearm to seal the wound of a brother officer.  A brave man can endure the prospect of bodily pain or violent death, or even the reality of it, without flinching.  But the danger that he knows how to face has to have something of nobility in it:  Courage is shown in surmounting your fear of being hurt or killed not through illness or a car accident, but through war.  Therefore, courage is seen more in Churchill's being under fire than in his willingness to be flayed by the doctor to help his wounded friend, though as a brave man he faced both kinds of pains well.  This endurance, which is really just doggedness, is an important part of courage and distinguishes someone who has the virtue from someone who does not have it.
<p>
It was Aristotle who invented the distinction between intellectual virtue and moral or ethical virtue, arguing that courage was one of the moral virtues, along with moderation, magnanimity, justice, veracity, and others.  He showed us that, like other moral virtues, courage is a habit, not an opinion or a frame of mind.  It is not enough simply to praise courage, or even to understand it.  To develop a habit like courage, you need chances to practice it.  Hence Churchill's eagerness to put himself in harm's way:  You can't act courageously without having dangers to face, and you can't cultivate a habit of courage without acting courageously.
<p>
Aristotle argued that, again like other moral virtues, courage is found in a mean, in between an excess and a defect.  The courageous man is not too afraid of dangers, like a coward, nor is he too unafraid of them, like a rash man.  Of the two extremes, the ordinary human bent is toward cowardice, because people have a natural disinclination to suffer pain or death -- a disinclination that is perfectly reasonable.  But rashness is a vice as well, because the rash man lacks the steadiness and the prudence of the courageous man.  Churchill acted rashly when he jumped off a bridge just after his 18th birthday to avoid being captured by his brother and a cousin, who were chasing him.  He fell 29 feet to the ground, ruptured his kidney among other organs, and for a year afterward "looked at life round a corner."  But rashness can be turned toward courage by age and experience more easily than cowardice can.
<p>
If wanting to avoid pain or death is perfectly reasonable, then courage, which puts you in harm's way, seems to have something in common with stupidity.  Churchill admits as much when he says of his trip to Cuba, "You might call it tomfoolery.  To travel thousands of miles with money one can ill afford, and get up at four o'clock in the morning in the hope of getting into a scrape in the company of perfect strangers, is hardly a rational proceeding."  Being virtuous is supposed to be pleasant, yet courage requires you to stand your ground tenaciously even when the consequence may be pain or death.  A brave man will sometimes charge into the enemy line, but a horse never will.  A horse is smart enough to shy away, and men often shy away too.  Hence Hobbes's notorious description of a battle as a running away on one side -- or both.
<p>
Nonetheless, Churchill knew "there were very few subalterns in the British Army who would not have given a month's pay" to share his adventure.  A courageous man does not just run away from battle.  He is willing to risk danger because, for him, avoiding pain and staying alive are not the most important things.  Everyone prefers to stay alive, of course; but the courageous man gives even his own life the proper weight:  not too little and not too much.  He isn't willing to pay any price just to stay alive, because he isn't willing to live just any kind of life.  He knows that everyone dies in the end, so what matters is the kind of life you live.  The price you pay to stay alive is too high if it means your life is not fully human; and a life of comfortable self-preservation is not a fully human life, because it lacks risk and adventure.  In addition to the endurance or tenacity -- the doggedness -- that I mentioned earlier, courage involves daring.  The courageous man dares, and dares greatly, like Churchill, who as a young man took risks over and over again to get to the battlefield, and then took risks on the battlefield to win a name for valor.
<p>
Here is a clue as to why he ranked courage first among the virtues.  For human beings, living means taking risks, because we are neither omniscient or omnipotent.  If we knew everything that was going to happen to us ahead of time, we could foresee and forestall injury and perhaps even death, but then life would be dull and not worth living.  Or, if we had the power to master everything, we could overcome even dangers that we could not foresee, which again would give us the conceit of absolute assurance and a very humdrum life.  Churchill explores these possibilities in his essay "A Second Choice," published in <I>Thoughts and Adventures</I>.
<p>
This idea of becoming omniscient or omnipotent is the real aspiration of modern science -- mastering nature, overcoming chance, learning to control our surroundings, taking the risk out of life by making it entirely predictable.  For Churchill, this aspiration is misbegotten, as he suggests in some of the other essays in <I>Thoughts and Adventures</I>.  Insofar as science succeeds in mastering nature -- and Churchill is impressed with the success of modern technology -- it adds to our power, but without making us better or happier.  As fast as we embrace the fruits of modern science, we find that the guarantee of a good life is still somewhere around the next corner.  And when men reach the limits of their ability to control the world -- for Churchill concludes that there are limits to our science and power, particularly when it comes to reshaping human nature -- then they may realize ruefully that what nature gives us is not so bad after all, compared to what we make for ourselves.  Indeed, that realization may prove a relief.
<p>
We do not have the kind of comprehensive knowledge that would allow us to avoid every wrong turn, but we can have a human wisdom that allows us to see a little way ahead, if we are prudent.  And we do not have the kind of absolute power that would allow us to overcome every obstacle and accomplish every wish, but we do have the human strength to make a better life for ourselves, if we act wisely.  Discernment is needed to guide our actions; that is the intellectual side.  But courage is the moral equipment we need to live in an uncertain world without letting ourselves be either reduced to malleable material directed from without (a cowardly surrender of our humanity) or seduced by the idea that human beings can control everything (a rash attempt to play God).
<p>
Modern science leads men into both mistakes by considering us at once as material beings undifferentiated from the rest of nature and as rational beings radically distinct from the rest of nature.  A more suitable and courageous posture is suggested by Aristotle, who found no mean part for men with the moral virtues (and no one who has read Aristotle will fault me for any originality in my treatment of courage, unless I have made any mistakes).  Winston Churchill's discoveries about courage are remarkably similar to Aristotle's treatment of that virtue in the <I>Nicomachean Ethics</I>.  Churchill was aware of this similarity, but he did not consider it a coincidence.  When someone recommended Aristotle's book to him and then asked Churchill what he thought after he had read it, the answer he got was that Aristotle's views on ethics were very sensible, but not very different from those that Churchill had formed on his own.
<p>
Courage is always a popular virtue, but especially in wartime, when it seems so obviously needed.  A coward is no use to others in case of danger, whereas everyone hopes to find a brave man fighting shoulder to shoulder at his side.  But courage is not useful only on the battlefield:  It also is a good sign that a person is worth befriending.  One who prizes his own comfort and life above everything else is too selfish to be a friend to anyone else.  Churchill mentions that, in his youth, men who had been in battle had an aura about them that was recognized by the girls they courted.  In this, the girls showed a nice understanding of what was good for them, since a coward is too selfish to give much consideration to anyone else -- even his own wife or family.
<p>
But a courageous man is not courageous simply because he seeks the esteem of others.  While that aspiration is a healthy spur to a young man learning to be courageous, it cannot be the motive of a man who has courage.  A courageous man does not sacrifice his own pleasure as he does courageous deeds, though he may sacrifice his own comfort; he takes pleasure in acting courageously, even if he has to endure pain.  The pain, or the risk of death, is a reminder that human beings are not all souls, that we live in bodies and are vulnerable through them.  It is also the reason that courage, as the first of the virtues, is on a lower level than others, like friendliness and wittiness, that do not require us to suffer pain.
<p>
Aristotle reserves courage, and the rest of the virtues as well, for gentlemen who have been properly raised.  But Churchill, though he does not turn up his nose at gentlemanliness, seems to encourage young men of spirit wherever he finds them.  He calls his autobiography <I>My Early Life</I> "a tale of youthful endeavour," dedicates it "to a new generation," and in it exhorts young men "all over the world" to take their places "in life's fighting line."  He tells them that they should never "take No for an answer" and "Never submit to failure."
<p>
Churchill's autobiography, which is still in print, is an adventure story that rivals for color, incident, and vivid description the best stories of Mark Twain, whom he admired.  Churchill would approve of the study of his own life as a spur to ambition, a guide to political judgment, and a model of courage, just as he studied and learned from the examples of his father Lord Randolph Churchill and his great forebear John Churchill, the first duke of Marlborough.
<p>
But Churchill is not the only one who can teach us courage.  Solzhenitsyn's books hold lessons for us too, especially his most impressive book, the three-volume <I>Gulag Archipelago</I>, which opens a whole new moral universe to the unsuspecting Western reader.  Beginning with <I>One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich</I>, the only one of his books that was published in communist Russia, Solzhenitsyn explored the question of what gives a human being strength to live a virtuous life under the most unpromising conditions.  <I>The Gulag Archipelago</I> affords a lengthier description of the men who discovered their souls under the bleak and distant sun of the Soviet death camps.  One of the merits of Solzhenitsyn's account is to show how that courage cannot quite stand alone as a moral virtue, that it needs to be paired with prudence.  Aristotle had come to the same conclusion.
<p>
And if we are looking for American heroes, some of the same discoveries may be made from reading the memoir written by our highest-ranking Vietnam POW, Admiral Jim Stockdale, and the woman who staunchly waited and worked for his return, Sybil Stockdale.  Stockdale is a man of remarkable thoughtfulness, a careful student of philosophers like Plato and Epictetus.  He had plenty of time to think as he endured privation and torture in the Hanoi Hilton.  The book he wrote with his wife, <I>In Love and War</I>, tells the story of his captivity from both sides.  Both endurance and daring, and the way these two elements of courage have to be guided by practical wisdom, can be learned from the Stockdales' book.
<p>
At first blush, Solzhenitsyn's warning that Americans might lack courage to prevail over the Soviets now seems too pessimistic.  The United States is the only remaining superpower:  The Soviet Union lies in the dust.  American steadiness won the Cold War, though my generation has never experienced a hot war worldwide.  Still, we have only to go back to the Gulf War to remember how the United States formed ranks against a nasty aggressor.  Though few Americans were called on to make sacrifices in that war, our experience in Korea, or in the two world wars, suggests our countrymen will not shrink from fighting to defend liberty.  In retrospect, Vietnam looks like an exception -- not that our soldiers, sailors, and airmen were loath to put themselves in harm's way, or the American people (with some sorry exceptions) to support them; but our political leaders lacked steady resolve to guide them and to explain the war to their fellow citizens.
<p>
Up to this point, I have emphasized courage in battle or in other situations of mortal danger.  That is a necessary corrective to the penchant today to prefer so-called moral courage, or the courage of your convictions, to real courage.  People who have the courage of their convictions, which means sincerity and a certain determination, have the strength of soul required for all the virtues, but not necessarily the particular moral habit of courage.  Voltaire is famous for saying that though he might disagree with what you said, he would defend to his death your right to say it.  For this sort of remark, he is widely praised for having moral courage.  But as Harvey Mansfield points out, that is not courage at all, but only cheap talk.  Voltaire never defended to the death anyone's right to say anything, much less something with which he disagreed; and it is doubtful that anyone ever has.
<p>
Since the decision to end the draft for American citizens, most of our young people have no experience of military service or the possibility of risking their lives for their country.  This deprives them of the usual way of learning about courage in practice.  But I do not mean to suggest that if you have no chance to go into battle, you cannot have courage.  That virtue belongs not only on the battlefield, but also in the peaceable lives of citizens and statesmen.  There is reason to be apprehensive about the courage of Americans today, from the man in the street right up to the White House.  Students are more likely to know about George Washington's false teeth than his courage as a general and statesman, and shoppers do not even remember whose birthday "Presidents' Day" once celebrated.  Public schools aim to make students fit in or to give them a specious self-esteem rather than teach them examples of the virtues, and courage is one of the most neglected.
<p>
Stigmatized as aggressive behavior by people who are hostile to anything noble, courage is treated with suspicion if it ever comes up; but mostly, the politically correct curriculum simply avoids mentioning it.  The kind of challenging, competitive, or warlike occasions that call forth courage are neither studied nor experienced in the classroom.  By giving up any effort to instruct students in moral virtues like courage, public schools discourage them.  The student who has faced exacting expectations from a teacher is a rare bird, easily recognizable by the unusual demands of his self-respect; but mostly, little is asked and little is learned.  Unambitious, unaccomplished, unenterprising students make half-hearted scholars, but they also are ill-prepared for life and make an easy mark for the engrossing distractions of alcohol, drugs, and television stupor.
<p>
Yet when you neglect the spirited part of students' souls, they do not just atrophy.  High aspirations remain, and students learn courage, if they do, in their increasingly risky unofficial dealings with each other and the world.  Too many of them are punished for their courage if they stand up to gang violence; others learn to act courageously in the bosom of a gang on behalf of a bad cause.  Public schools and the media maintain a conspiratorial silence about the prevalence of gang violence.  Parents do not want to believe it and too often are oblivious to the problem, but students know all about it.
<p>
Students today seem starved for good examples, for some relief from the public school professionalism that chills their ardent curiosity about the right way to live and denies them the kind of rousing adventures that appealed to young Winston Churchill.  Teachers who love their subjects and hold students to high standards, academic contests with winners and losers, conversations in class that give students a chance to explore their own questions with the help of classic writings -- these traditional methods could bring some excitement back into the classroom.  Students would be as encouraged to see dumbed-down, mealy-mouthed textbooks replaced with real books as to see dumbed-down, mealy-mouthed facilitators replaced with real teachers.
<p>
The long-run effects of neglecting courage go beyond our schools to civil society, where a parallel professionalism makes courts ineffective at maintaining civil order.  In our political leaders, lack of courage manifests itself, as Churchill observed, in living "in the temperamental atmosphere of a Gallup Poll -- always feeling one's pulse and taking one's temperature."  The politics of meeting the demands of your constituents, of pleasing an often uninstructed public, of changing your stance to get re-elected -- in short, what you might call the politics of valetudinarianism -- is rampant today (not that cautious compromise is always wrong, or a shift in position always the sign of a craven politician).
<p>
But Churchill warns that that sort of politician is increasingly common in our democratic age.  As usual, he reflects on this subject in his writings.  As he writes in "Fifty Years Hence," an essay published in <I>Thoughts and Adventures</I>, "Democratic governments drift along the line of least resistance, taking short views, paying their way with sops and doles and smoothing their path with pleasant-sounding platitudes."  That's a good description of presidential politics today.  Few of our politicians understand Churchill's remark that "politics is almost as exciting as war and quite as dangerous" because "in war you can only be killed once, but in politics many times."  Most of them are too timid to risk being killed politically even once.
<p>
In his essay on "Consistency in Politics" in <I>Thoughts and Adventures</I>, Churchill explores his view of political courage.  He deprecates the small-souled kind of consistency that means unbending adherence to a certain position, no matter what the circumstances; circumstances change, so positions have to change too.  A larger consistency means that a man has "the same dominating purpose," as he writes, even if circumstances force him to throw his weight now on one side, now on the other of a durable political controversy.  For instance, it is impossible to say in principle whether defense spending should be higher or lower; it is only possible to make a practical judgment about what the current situation requires, which may change from one year to the next.
<p>
But, as his countrymen would discover in the 1930s when he began his brave but lonely campaign to warn them of the Nazi menace, Churchill had no time for the kind of politician who simply swims with the current.  Such a timid policy neglects a statesman's responsibility as custodian of his nation's abiding interests.  Representative government requires a certain courage in its statesmen:  the courage to show constituents their true interests instead of just reflecting their wishes.  Americans citizens need that kind of instruction as much as their political leaders need the political courage and discernment to offer it.
<p>
When Solzhenitsyn explored the reason for resistance to Soviet tyranny in the third volume of <I>The Gulag Archipelago</I>, he found it in the courage of some human beings who had, as he said, "a nobler conception of life."  Courage is the virtue that defends our liberty; it is also the first virtue of a man who is truly free.  Therefore, it belongs, in the company of the other moral virtues, with what Russell Kirk finely described as "the permanent things."

<h3>Eve Without Adam: What Genesis Has to Tell America About Natural Law</h3>
By David F. Forte<br>
Professor of Law, Cleveland-Marshall College of Law, Cleveland State University
<p>
Heritage Lecture No. 570<br>
A <a href="/heritage/kirk/kirklect.html">Russell Kirk Memorial Lecture</a><br>
Delivered May 1, 1996<br>
<p>

In the spring of 1992, I was ensconced here on the fifth floor of the Heritage Foundation. There I was, ferreting out the historical basis of the Supreme Court's right to strike down legislation, when, from a few blocks away, the Justices graced my work with the following statement:
	<p>
<blockquote>At the heart of liberty is the right to define one's own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life. (<I>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey</I>, 112 S.Ct. 2791, 2807 [1992].)
</blockquote>
<p>
All that was mine?  I thought. You mean, I -- on the fifth floor of the Heritage Foundation -- could define "existence," "the mystery of human life," and the "universe" too?  Yes, said the Court. All I need do, the Justices said, was accept the right of the Court to "speak before all others" on constitutional ideals and to follow its lead no matter what qualms of conscience I might have. The Court made that statement, of course, to support the right of a woman to terminate the life of the developing human fetus within her. But somehow, the Court's declaration had a more ancient ring to it.
<p>
Normally when I speak at the Heritage Foundation, I talk about law. But I am not going to talk about law today, even though the Supreme Court has inspired this reflection. Instead, I want to talk to you about a cultural moment, a moment Russell Kirk worked for and, I am sure, prayed for all his life. We are at a time when faith and reason, which moderns regard as antagonists, are resuming a partnership long overdue. Faith and reason are, in fact, two pillars of Western civilization, and their reintegration comes at a time when the hallmarks of that civilization are disintegrating around us.
<p>
I need not chronicle the statistics of our decline. You are familiar enough with them. <a href="/heritage/staff/bennett.htm">William Bennett</a>, Gary Bauer, Marvin Olasky, and so many others have described a society where each person has become disconnected with his fellows, where we create zones of privacy to find ourselves and lose everyone else in the bargain. We are a citizenry where to a large extent, metaphorically speaking, Eve exists without Adam, Adam without Eve, where neither truth nor permanence are seen as real and relationships of all sorts are fitful, episodic, and transient.
<P>
This may be an America where there are a thousand points of light, but each one illuminates only itself. Faith is an outlaw in the public square, and philosophy deconstructs reason itself.
<p>
It was not always this way. It certainly was not this way at the founding of the country. For, as the Founders knew so well, Western civilization was built upon both reason and faith: the faith of the Judeo-Christian revelation and the reason that discovered and applied the natural law.
<p>
Today, I wish to make but three points. First, I want to discuss something of the history of the alliance between faith and reason in Western intellectual history and their estrangement. Second, by referring to some of the elements in the Book of Genesis, I would like to affirm the basic compatibility between the principles of the natural law and the values of our religious heritage. Finally, I raise a caution regarding religious doctrine and liberty that any effective and principled alliance between faith and reason must deal with.
<p>
<b>Faith and Reason</b>
<p>
	The Greeks, who gave us so much, gave us the natural law school of thought, particularly in the writings of Aristotle. Natural law was subsequently universalized by the Stoics, incorporated into the law by the Romans, allied with Christianity, and finally raised to its highest exposition by St. Thomas Aquinas in his Scholastic philosophy. The school of natural law championed man's reason, his being, his capacity for sociability, and his virtue. The values espoused by that school dominated Western thought through the end of the 18th century and were included in the principles of the American Founding.
<p>
The Judeo-Christian revelation provided the other, complementary notion of the nature of man: created by God, fallen, covenanted, and graced with a divinely inspired mission.
<P>
In the high Middle Ages, the traditions of faith and reason reached their greatest level of integration in the natural law philosophy of Thomas Aquinas. Scholasticism constituted the most fully developed version of natural law, while of the faith of the Church unified Europe. Then came the Renaissance, the Protestant Reformation, and the age of scientific inquiry. The link between faith and reason was weakened, and eventually broken. The age of Reformation and Rationalism was launched. Faith sought to undo the shackles of reason, while reason tried to free itself of the shackles of religion.
<P>
Important Protestant theologians found the good solely through the will of God as revealed in His Word, while rationalists forsook natural law thinking as being too close to religion. The Reformation disparaged the Scholasticism of the high Middle Ages. God's law was divine positive law, and no natural law could independently find the good.
<p>
Not that natural law was extinguished at the end of the high Middle Ages. On the contrary, the cultural force that the alliance of faith and reason had created lasted for centuries. Even though Protestant theology rejected Scholasticism, Biblical values paralleled the norms of natural law. Magnanimity was charity, courage was fortitude, fidelity was faithfulness, community was congregation. On the other hand, although few philosophers "did" natural law from the 14th century on, most traded on its fundamental norms. Sir Edward Coke found natural justice to be "right reason," which was the basis of the common law. John Locke presumed those norms to be in the law of nature, which both limited and gave legitimacy to individual liberty. When international politics degenerated into self-interested discord, Grotius, Pufendorf, and Vattel sought to revive a modified natural law to restore some moral order to the relations between states.
<P>
The Founders fully understood that a civil society could not be maintained without recourse to the intellectual values of the natural law and the parallel spiritual values of revelation. Washington knew how crucial that bond was. As he said in his farewell address:
<P><blockquote>
	Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, Religion and Morality are indispensable supports.... In Vain would man claim the tribute of Patriotism, who should labour to avert these great pillars of human happiness, these firmest props of the duties of Men and Citizens. The mere Politician, equally with the pious man ought to respect and to cherish them.... And let us with caution indulge the supposition, that morality can be maintained without religion.
</blockquote><p>
By the 19th century, however, the connection between the mind and the spirit was finally severed. When religion and revelation could no longer restrain reason and positivism, the power of the state and the power of the unconstrained individual came to the fore. It is not much of an exaggeration that the problems of politics since the 19th century in the world lie in the contest between the supposedly self-sufficient power of the state on the one hand and the supposedly self-sufficient power of the individual on the other. The higher law that tames both is absent.
<p>
In the 19th century, natural law had retreated to being a Catholic intellectual discipline. It was disdained in the academy. A character in Stendahl declares, "There's no such thing as natural law. This expression is nothing but old nonsense."  A lot of "old nonsense" was done away with in Fichte, Hegel, and Marx, in Austin, Bentham, and Holmes.
<p>
It was not until the aftermath of World War II, in confronting the Holocaust, that natural law stirred again in the conscience of the philosopher and the judge. If the Holocaust was evil, pure and simple, then there must be a good, pure and simple. If we shrink from thinking that the Final Solution can ever have been a valid human law because its purpose was so utterly perverse, there must be a purposive standard by which we can know what laws are indeed legitimate or not.
<P>
And so the revival began, kindling in different places: Jacques Maritain in France, Russell Kirk in the United States, the Hart/Fuller debate. By the 1980s, natural law had once again become an independent philosophical discipline. Dozens of books and hundreds of articles poured out. Natural law as a vibrant school of philosophy has returned. It is something we have not seen for six centuries.
<p>
Today, in the face of the dissolution wrought by positivism, there is a renewed alliance between faith and reason. Natural law thought is flourishing, pursued by Catholics, Jews, and Protestants, while a reawakening to faith stirs throughout the country. Pope John Paul II calls a return to natural law values essential to saving Western civilization itself, while Protestant ministers and political activists from the late Martin Luther King, Jr., to Ralph Reed find in the natural law those essential human values that are confirmed by revelation. The "law written on men's hearts," as St. Paul puts it, is once again recognized by Protestant Christianity.

<p>
<b>Genesis and the Natural Law</b>
<p>
The renewed alliance between faith and reason makes eminent sense, for the fundamental view of nature and of humanity articulated in the natural law school parallels the divine definition of creation and man taught by revelation. The example I use today is Genesis, though there are myriad other instances. I do not do so as a Biblical exegete. I am not qualified for that. But I do know something about the natural law and find that its insights are confirmed in many parts of the saga of creation in the Book of Genesis, at least according to many common interpretations of that text.
<p>
Every culture's creation stories reveal its basic concept of what is human, what is nature, and what is divine. In Genesis, we have a compilation of creation stories. Taken together, they tell us in mythic language what reason has brought us to apprehend in natural law. In its own terms, Genesis tells us what natural law tells us. It speaks to us of natural man and created man, of conjoined man and disunited man. It affirms man's reason, his goodness, his unity, and his ego. 	 Let me discuss just three parts of Genesis in relation to the natural law: the creation of the material world, the creation of man, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
<p>
Now, I am not going to talk about the creationism, or sin, or sex. If you want to talk about evolution, let's discuss it over coffee. If you want to talk about sin, perhaps we can do that over a beer. If you want to talk about sex, sorry, I'm a married man.
<p>
Let us start with the account of creation in the first chapter:
<p><blockquote>
	In the beginning, when God created the heavens and the earth, the earth was a formless waste, and darkness covered the abyss, and the mighty wind [the spirit of God] swept over the waters. (Genesis 1:1-2.)
</blockquote><p>
In that one majestic verse, God's creation astonishes us in two simultaneous ways. First, He creates everything ("the heavens and the earth") out of nothing. Second, He brings order out of chaos. In the image of the ancient Hebrews, the stuff of the cosmos was water, and water symbolized chaos -- which God orders. Think for a moment of the difference between farmers and fishermen: A farmer subdues the land and makes it his servant, but an experienced fisherman knows he is always a stranger on the sea and is never home till he reaches shore.
<p>
In Genesis, God's mighty spirit moves across the water, pushing it where He wills. He orders chaos itself. Recall in the New Testament, when Jesus awakens in the boat to still the storm that was threatening to overwhelm the disciples. "Who can this be," they ask in awe, "that the wind and the sea obey him?"  (Mark 4:41.) The disciples understood that this was no ordinary wonder-worker. In Genesis, God pushes the water out of the world by creating a domed firmament and separates the remaining water in the world into seas while permitting some of the remaining cosmic waters to sluice in as rain through holes in the dome, or bubble up from below through springs (oases perhaps) or rivers.
<p>
The point of creation is that without order, there would not be nothingness, but utter chaos. Let us reflect on that. People will give up their lives for order. They will die for their country, their faith, their family, or their friends. But a life without meaning leads to despair. Chaos, not death, holds the real terror for man. In the most primeval sense, a terrorist does the devil's work.
<p>
Notice also in this first chapter, that as soon as God controls chaos, pushing a mighty wind over the seas, He creates light. (Genesis 1:3.) Light is the greatest of the elements. Light is good. It illuminates the order he is creating. It is understanding. Throughout scripture, the notion of light is always seen as illuminating an understanding of the inner reality of things.
<p>
Finally, God proceeds, in a measured and deliberative manner, to create the remainder of material reality. Even with their pre-scientific notions, the Hebrews understood that everything created was logically and organically interrelated, and that reality was created in a purposeful manner from the most basic to the more refined. There is a purpose and a point to creation. It leads to man. And in finishing the work of creation, God said that it was good. (Genesis 1:31.)
<p>
In this most fundamental description of reality, natural law concurs. In natural law, reality is objective and ordered, and man is organically part of it. Socrates taught that man's reason could apprehend and illuminate this reality. He spent his life battling the Sophists, who saw only chaos underlying everything. Plato sought to discover the good that was the ultimate reality. Aristotle found that the world was the result not of chance, but of intelligent intention. He taught that change was not chaotic, but purposeful, wherein each thing moves to fulfill its own nature, and that being -- existence itself -- was in its very nature, good. All these elements were synthesized in Aquinas.
<P>
Similar parallels are in the account of man.
<p>
In the first chapter of Genesis, God creates man and woman equally in his image; that is, unlike the animals, men and women are to reflect the divine. In the second story of creation, God creates man (adam = universal humanity) and finds that "it is not good for man to be alone, I will make a suitable partner for him."  (Genesis 2:18.) God's creation is incomplete. It is not yet "good."  In natural law, too, things are good only when their nature is fulfilled, when their potentialities are brought to completion.
<p>
In Genesis, for man (that is, mankind in its individualization) to be complete, he needs a helpmeet. Likewise, in the natural law tradition, Aristotle insists that man cannot truly flourish as a human unless he is associated together in the polity. From Aristotle on, the natural law tradition emphasizes the fundamental good of friendship, defined as seeking the good of the other. In Genesis, there is a special complementarity in the friendship of a man and a woman, which becomes the fundamental experience of the good of sociability of each individual.
<p>
In natural law, sociability (which I think is natural law's unique contribution to understanding contemporary problems) is something without which man cannot flourish as a human person. It has its most intense fulfillment in the relations between a man and a woman in the family. That ordering of human relations is a fundamental good attached to human nature itself.
<p>
We can see already how radically similar the views of revelation and natural law are on the nature of reality and of man. Order, reason, community, purposeful action, the goodness of being, sociability, sexual complementarity are essential to both.
<p>
Now we come to the part of the story that everybody knows best: the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. Adam and Eve, you recall, could eat of all the fruit of the trees in the Garden except one. But the serpent was a persuasive advocate:
<p><blockquote>
	The serpent asked the woman, "Did God really tell you not to eat from any of the trees in the garden?"  The woman answered the serpent: "We may eat of the fruit of the trees in the garden; it is only about the fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden that God said, `You shall not eat it or even touch it, lest you die.'"  But the serpent said to the woman: "You certainly will not die!  No. God knows well that the moment you eat of it your eyes will be opened and you will be like gods who know what is good and what is bad."  The woman saw that the tree was good for food, pleasing to the eyes, and desirable for gaining wisdom. So she took some of the fruit and ate it; and she also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it. Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized that they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made loincloths for themselves. (Genesis 2:1-7.)
</blockquote><p>
The serpent said three things about this tree. Fruit is sweet tasting. Knowledge is a delight. And you can be like God. Now, I love caramel sundaes, but I can turn down a sweet. I revel in the life of the mind, but I don't really have to know everything. But to be like a God -- that's a dizzying prospect. The exegetes tell us that the temptation to Eve and to Adam was to define for oneself what the scheme of good and evil is instead of apprehending what is objectively good for man. If I can define for myself for my own world, if I can determine what is good and evil, then for that little world of my making, I am a god. The serpent did say something else. He said Eve would not die. In the end, the promise to be a god, as enticing as it may be, is always a false promise.
<p>
By eating the fruit, Eve names good and evil for herself. Remember that earlier in this chapter of Genesis, God had given Adam the right to name the animals, to distinguish them, to find their inner scientific order. But the naming of good and evil, God retains to himself. Man was given reason to apprehend good and evil, but he does not, in his nature, possess the capacity for creating it.
<p>
Aristotle teaches that a just man is one who practices virtue, and he defines virtue as the habit of acting rightly. When one acts rightly, one reflects or participates in the objective moral order (the image of God in the words of Genesis). But when one defines the moral order for himself, he images nothing but his own will. By definition, under the natural law, one cannot act virtuously if one is knowingly acting outside of the objective moral order.
<p>
Having asserted one's own will as defining good and evil, the results ineluctably follow. For, as the story of creation predicted, without order there is not nothingness, but the terror and distress of chaos.
<p>
There is first the disorder of the soul, in the form of shame. Second, social cohesion is shattered. God strolls through the Garden of Eden and accuses Adam of eating of the forbidden tree. And Adam dissembles: "The woman whom you put here with me -- she gave me fruit from the tree, and so I ate it."  (Genesis 2:12.) Even in the garden of Eden, the man abandons the woman. They are no longer friends. The bonds of sociability are broken. As soon as we take unto ourselves the right to define good and evil, we jettison the interconnectedness between one another that our natures call us to have. Trust vanishes.
<p>
Lest you think that such insights come only from a religious tradition, let me read to you Cicero:
<blockquote><P>
	True law is right reason in agreement with nature; it is of universal application, unchanging and everlasting; it summons to duty by its commands, and averts wrongdoing by its prohibitions.... It is a sin to try to alter this law, nor is it allowable to attempt to repeal any part of it, and it is impossible to abolish it entirely. We cannot be freed from its obligations by senate or people, and we need not look outside ourselves for an expounder or interpreter of it. And there will not be different laws at Rome and at Athens, or different laws now and in the future, but one eternal and unchangeable law will be valid for all nations and all times, and there will be one master and ruler, that is, God, over us all, for he is the author of this law, its promulgator, and its enforcing judge. Whoever is disobedient is fleeing from himself and denying his human nature, and by reason of this very fact he will suffer the worst penalties, even if he escapes what is commonly considered punishment. (<I>De Republica</I> 3:21.)
</blockquote><p>
Cicero never read Genesis.
<p>
The Supreme Court's definition of human nature in <I>Casey</I> has given us Eve without Adam, and Adam without Eve. We are solitary autonomous beings, unconnected, without responsibility for each other. The Court empowers us to define ourselves, to create our own universe, to be, as Genesis predicted, "like God."  In the same way in which the Supreme Court makes law without a constitutional standard, it has declared that there is no rule of law against which we must measure our own actions. We make the rule of law for ourselves, each one a different rule of law. So, for example, we often hear the familiar non sequitur, "I believe abortion is the taking of human life, but I would never want to impose my values on you."  It denies us the fundamental natural law standard of an objective basis of morality, and equally denies us the opportunity to strive to that perfection to which we are constituted.
<p>
That is our world today, and it comes from the disdaining of religion and of reason. The world of deconstructed philosophy, of private moralities, of God that cannot be mentioned in the public square leaves Eve without Adam, unborn children without their mothers, born children without their fathers, and the dying without hope. The homeless are not just those we see on the streets. Such a world leaves us all homeless. That is the Faustian bargain that the Supreme Court offers us in <I>Casey</I>.
<p>
Thus, there is little wonder that the philosophers of the school of natural law and the followers of revealed religion find themselves in a political, intellectual, and moral alliance today.

<p>
<b>Religious Doctrine and Human Liberty</b>
<p>
For the alliance of reason and faith to be effective, it must contend with issues of doctrine and with issues of liberty. The beauty of the natural law philosophy is that it is universal. It calls upon all persons to consider and freely to order their lives by an objective moral standard. Whether or not creationism can be justified scientifically, the rest of our society perceives it solely as a religious doctrine. Whether or not contraception is contrary to the natural law, the rest of our society perceives it as a Catholic doctrine. A simple rule of prudence requires that those values not be imposed. This is not to say, however, that the scientific shortcomings of evolutionary theory cannot be discussed. They should be. Nor that contraceptives should be distributed in the schools. We know the objective harm that brings and the invasion of the family it constitutes. But that is different from imposing those values as doctrines. Abortion, obviously, is qualitatively different because it is a universal question of how a moral society treats dependent life.
<p>
The other issue is liberty. Two points should be made here. First, we sometimes forget that under the plan of God, mankind was utterly free, except for eating of the tree of good and evil. As Pope John Paul II emphasizes, freedom and virtue depend upon there being an objective order, which we can accept or not. Without an objective moral order, there is no true freedom, for it has nothing to measure itself against. Second, modern natural law theory must acknowledge the great advances in the justification for liberty that 18th century natural rights theory made. Modern natural law theory, in its mature form, finds the freedom of the human individual rooted in the good, and holds that political authority is contingent upon that human freedom.
<p>
But what natural law offers in addition is that the free, flourishing individual prospers in his social relations, most especially in the family. What Adam Smith and John Locke presumed in their vaguely perceived notions of natural law and in the social experience of the Enlightenment was that these social relations would flourish of themselves. For the most part they were right. But we have learned in the two centuries past, and especially in this country, that those relations, the family, are much more fragile than we imagined and that for true liberty to be enjoyed, such relations need to be fostered and nurtured. For natural law not only judges what human laws ought not to be passed, but also illuminates the benign face of the law: It looks to those laws that ought to be enacted to assist human persons in the flourishing of their free individual personalities. Natural law is not only imperative; it is aspirational.
<P>
<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>
When a philosophy -- even one like natural law -- is in the ascendancy, intellectual fatigue, as well as impatience with the imperfections any human system has, slowly brings on criticism and perhaps even rejection. But when order threatens to break down altogether, when chaos looms, then the mind reaches back to the stability of principle. Man cannot abide error for too long, for error produces a disintegration, a disorder of the soul, and a disorder of society. We can live a complex life; we can live a life of contradictions; but we cannot live an absurd life. That is our nature.
<p>
Whenever subjective relativism and objective truth have come into contest, whenever the choice is one or the other, man will ultimately opt for the truth, no matter how discomfiting it may be. Just look at whom we choose for heroes:
<p>
Is it Antigone or Creon?
<p>
Socrates or Alcibiades?
<p>
Is it Ruth, who embraces the One God despite the humiliation it brings, or her sister-in-law Orpah, who remains comfortable with the pagans?
<p>
Is it Lincoln or Douglas?
<p>
Solzhenitsyn or Brezhnev?
<p>
Jesus or Pilate?
<P>
Only when faith and reason are rejoined in mutually respecting friendship and are cognizant of liberty can the bonds of civil society, of civilization itself, be renewed. That moment may be upon us once again. May it come soon.

<title>Why Congress Should Not Impose Mandates on Private Health Insurance - Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3>WHY CONGRESS SHOULD NOT IMPOSE MANDATES ON PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE</h3>
By Carrie Gavora<br>
Policy Analyst<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 462<br>
September 18, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congress is poised to enact legislation which, for the first time, would require private commercial health insurance carriers to provide specific benefits. Such federal mandates inevitably increase costs while limiting consumer choice and competition. In particular, these proposed mandated benefits would increase the costs of health insurance premiums for employers, who then would either limit health benefits or pass the higher costs on to workers and their families in the form of lower wages. Worse, Congress would be establishing a precedent for legislative determination of what medical benefits, treatments, or procedures Americans must have in their personal insurance plans.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Making Health Policy Through the Appropriations Process.</b> During consideration of H.R. 3666, the Veterans Administration and Housing and Urban Development appropriations bill, the United States Senate by voice vote approved an amendment offered by Senator Bill Bradley (D-NJ) that would require insurers to cover a mother and newborn for at least two nights in the hospital after a normal birth, and at least four nights after a caesarean section. Coverage for fewer days would be permissible if agreed to by the attending physician in consultation with the mother.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In addition, by a vote of 82 to 15, the Senate adopted a mental health "parity" amendment offered by Senators Pete Domenici (R-NM) and Paul Wellstone (D-MN). This amendment -- a scaled-down version of the mental health parity provision dropped from the recently enacted Kennedy-Kassebaum health insurance reform bill -- would require group health insurers who offer mental health coverage and apply aggregate lifetime and annual payment limits on coverage either (a) to include plan payments made for mental health services under the aggregate lifetime and annual payment limits for medical or surgical services, or (b) to establish a separate aggregate lifetime and annual payment limit for mental health that is equal to or greater than the limit established for medical and surgical services. On September 11, the House of Representatives, by a vote of 392 to 17, passed a nonbinding instruction to conferees on the VA-HUD bill to adopt both provisions. Both the Bradley and Domenici-Wellstone amendments represent a not-so-subtle creep of government control over the health care market.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Compounding State Regulation.</b> The overregulation of health insurance at the state level is a problem for both small businesses and insurers. In 1970, there were 48 mandated benefit laws (laws requiring specific treatments, benefits, or procedures) nationwide. As of 1995, because of intense lobbying by medical practitioners and advocates seeking coverage for various diseases, the number had risen to over 920. And this does not include almost 100 so-called anti-managed care laws (such as "any willing provider" and "mandatory point of service" laws) by which states restrict the ability of managed care plans to contract with providers and establish cost sharing.<sup>1</sup>  The most prominent form of federally tax supported, employer-based health insurance is managed care. Because of the rapid expansion of this form of health care, with its restrictions imposed on both doctors and patients, state legislatures are rapidly increasing their regulation of the insurance industry. More than 1,000 managed care bills are being considered in state legislatures in 1996; 56 have been passed into law in 35 states so far.<sup>2</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Imposing Higher Costs.</b> The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that Senator Bradley's maternity benefit mandate would cost the federal government alone some $223 million over four years in increased outlays for Medicaid and the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), and in lost revenues due to lower wages from increased health costs. The CBO also says that the new maternity benefit would increase aggregate premium payments for employee-based and individually purchased health plans by 0.06 percent. In addition to the extra costs for government programs, the CBO estimates that direct private-sector costs would increase by $180 million in 1998 and $220 million in 2001.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

According to a CBO analysis conducted on behalf of the Senate Budget Committee, the estimated cost of the Domenici-Wellstone mental health parity provision of the VA-HUD appropriations bill is less than the earlier version -- estimated at $618 million over 5 years (the provision sunsets in 2001).<sup>3</sup>  The potential cost also was reduced somewhat by a modifying amendment, offered by Senator Phil Gramm (R-TX), stipulating that if a group health policy experienced a premium increase of 1 percent or more in a given year due to this provision, that insurance policy could be exempted from the mandate.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While both amendments attempt to address real issues -- namely, the equitable treatment of mental health services and the health and safety of mothers and newborns -- they are bad public policy. The federal government should not be in the business of determining what benefits, treatments, or procedures private health insurance must provide to patients. This should be a contractual decision between consumers and insurers, and between doctors and patients. Whether to cover treatment for mental illness (or any illness) should be an insurance contract issue, not a political decision or an area for congressional intervention.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Moreover, experience at the state level indicates that mandates typically are the product of intense lobbying by provider interests rather than sound health policy. Thus, Congress should realize that once one group of practitioners begins to benefit from legally mandated coverage for its services, others will argue for similar legal guarantees. In the meantime, the price of legally privileged medical benefits hurts legally underprivileged medical practitioners, because businesses or insurers have to cut back other benefits to accommodate the new law. Desperately fighting for equal treatment, the excluded practitioners and advocates for certain disease groups lobby intensively for expansion of the mandates. The slippery slope of mandated benefits is transformed into  spiraling costs.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Let Consumers Fire Bad Insurance Companies.</b> Rather than adopt bad health care policy, Congress should allow consumers to choose not only their health insurance coverage, but also the kinds of medical treatments and procedures they want at the prices they wish to pay. In a consumer choice system, individuals and families -- not employers or managed care companies -- would choose the health plans and benefits that best suit their needs. The mother of a newborn forced out of a hospital before her time should have the right to fire her insurance company. Individuals and families, given tax relief regardless of where they work, should be able to purchase comprehensive health insurance, including catastrophic coverage, without imposing high costs on the private health insurance plans of other workers and their families with different needs. While rhetorically packaged with phrases like "incremental reforms" or "patient protections," federal mandates -- especially on top of state mandates -- do nothing to reform America's health care system. All they do is raise costs and limit consumer choice and competition.

<li>The mental health parity provision agreed to earlier this year by the Senate would have imposed huge new costs on working families. The CBO estimated that premiums for traditional fee for service plans would increase by 5.3 percent, while managed care plans would cost the consumer an additional 4 percent. Understanding that it is workers and their families that ultimately bear the costs of mandated benefits, the CBO predicted that this provision would force employers either to cut back other benefits -- or health insurance altogether -- or to pass the higher cost of insurance on to workers in the form of lower wages.

<title>The Chemical Weapons Convention: Unverifiable, Unenforceable, and a Burden to Business - Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3>THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION:
UNVERIFIABLE, UNENFORCEABLE, AND A BURDEN TO BUSINESS</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/spring.htm">Baker Spring</a><br>
Senior Policy Analyst<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a>
<br>
Executive Memorandum No. 460<br>
September 12, 1996 <br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Later this week, the United States Senate will vote on ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).  The CWC is a multilateral treaty that would bar the production and stockpiling of chemical weapons by the countries that ratify it.  Given its sweeping provisions, the ratification of the CWC carries important implications for U.S. policies on  arms control, non-proliferation, defense, regulation, and above all, national security.  As a result, Senators need to consider the CWC carefully and not assume that it deserves support merely because it professes to outlaw chemical weapons.  In fact, the CWC will fail to achieve its stated goal of a global ban on chemical weapons.  Moreover, the CWC will make America more vulnerable to chemical weapon attack in the future while imposing an unwarranted and costly burden on American business. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	If ratified, the Chemical Weapons Convention would:
<p><ul>
<li><b> Increase the risk of chemical weapons being used.</b>  By undermining the U.S. chemical deterrent, the CWC may increase the likelihood that chemical weapons would be used.  The experience of World War II shows that an aggressor possessing chemical weapons will hesitate to use them to attack a country that also possesses such weapons. If the U.S. bans all of its chemical weapons, as required by the CWC, outlaw states that retain them will have a military advantage over the U.S. and other countries that have banned them. This military advantage increases the likelihood that chemical weapons could be used against the U.S.
 <p>
 <li><b> Be unverifiable.</b> Despite elaborate and burdensome verification provisions, compliance with the CWC cannot be adequately verified.  At a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, then-Director of Central Intelligence James Woolsey warned that "the chemical weapons problem is so difficult from an intelligence perspective that I cannot state that we have high confidence in our ability to detect noncompliance, especially on a small scale."
 <p>
 <li><b> Be unenforceable.</b>  Violations of the CWC are likely to go unpunished. If a violation were to occur, the United Nations Security Council would have to impose penalties severe enough to change the behavior of an outlaw state.  But the five permanent members of the Security Council can veto any enforcement resolution lodged against them or their friends.  China and Russia, for example, can simply veto resolutions imposing sanctions on them if they disagree with other Security Council members.
 <p>
 <li><b> Impose a heavy regulatory burden on U.S. businesses.</b>  There are over 7,700 production facilities in the U.S. that may be subject to CWC-related reporting and inspection requirements.  The direct cost to business could be as high as $200 million annually, while indirect costs could run into billions of dollars a year.
 <p>
<li><b> Increase the risk of proliferation of chemical weapons.</b>  Article XI of the CWC requires cooperation among nations in the peaceful uses of chemicals.  In many respects, this provision resembles the 1950s Atoms for Peace arrangement to foster the peaceful uses of nuclear power.  This is the approach to arms control and trade that has been used to justify Russia's sale of nuclear reactors to Iran. The last thing the world needs is a "Poison for Peace" program that helps spread chemical weapons around the world, as the Atoms for Peace did for nuclear reactors to Iran and North Korea.
<p>
 The chief lobbying group for the chemical industry, the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA), supports ratification of the CWC, and the prospect for increased sales of dangerous chemicals to countries like Iran may be the reason why. CMA member companies that produce and export chemicals would be subject to stricter limits on exports if the U.S. does not ratify the CWC. It would be sad indeed if the CMA were putting its own economic interest ahead of the nation's security in supporting ratification.
 <p>
<li><b> Not enhance U.S. security.</b>  By making arms control an end in itself, the CWC will not protect U.S. national security.  Arms control is only one of several means for achieving the goal of national security. America needs the additional tools of deterrence, defenses, and even offensive military operations. It makes no sense for America to give up its chemical weapons if other nations still possess them.
<p>
<li><b> Be inconsistent with America's global responsibilities.</b> The CWC, by treating all nations alike, fails to acknowledge America's special role in global security. Superpower status imposes important global responsibilities which the U.S. can fulfill only by maintaining armed forces capable of projecting overwhelming force around the globe. Because America has these special responsibilities, it is treated as an exceptional case under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty regarding the possession of nuclear weapons.  The same principle should apply to America's chemical weapons arsenal.
</ul><p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Advising and consenting to the ratification of treaties is one of the Senate's most solemn constitutional responsibilities.  This is particularly so when the treaty under consideration has profound implications for the security of the nation.  Given all that is stake with the CWC, Senators should scrutinize carefully all the provisions and implications of the treaty before they vote.  This will lead to an inescapable conclusion: Ratifying the CWC would leave America less secure and would pose unreasonable costs on American businesses.

<title>Government's Hidden Tax: Time to Account for the Cost of Regulation - Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3>GOVERNMENT'S HIDDEN TAX: TIME TO ACCOUNT FOR THE COST OF REGULATION</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/antonel.htm">Angela Antonelli</a><br>
Deputy Director for Economic Policy Studies<sup>1</sup><br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 459<br>
September 10, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Senate is expected soon to consider <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/cpquery/z?cp104:hr660.104:">H.R. 3756</a>, the Treasury and postal appropriations bill, which includes funding for the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB). On July 23, the Senate Appropriations Committee adopted an amendment -- Section 645, offered by Senator Ted Stevens (R-AK) -- requiring OMB to prepare an accounting statement that estimates the cumulative costs and benefits of federal regulatory programs. OMB already is responsible for reviewing regulatory actions to ensure that they are consistent with the Administration's regulatory principles and agenda.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While there is much debate about federal taxes, spending, and the need to balance the budget, considerably less is known and understood about the benefits and burdens of regulation. Unlike federal tax and spending programs, no comprehensive cost accounting system exists for regulation. But regulatory costs -- $677 billion in 1996 -- are nearly one-half the cost of direct taxation. And the economic impact is significant; according to one estimate, federal regulations cause $1.3 trillion in U.S. economic activity to be lost each year. Just as the annual federal budget allows policymakers and the public to debate and decide what programs to support and which ones to scale back and eliminate, information on regulatory costs and benefits would help them to determine what regulations do the most good for the money spent, set regulatory priorities accordingly, and minimize the burden on the economy.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

<b>A Good First Step.</b> Under the Stevens proposal, OMB would be required to submit to Congress by September 30, 1997, a report on the cumulative costs and benefits of federal regulatory programs. OMB also must report on the effect of federal rules, both on the private sector and on the federal government, and provide estimates of the costs and benefits of rules costing more than $100 million annually. The public would have an opportunity to comment on the OMB report before it is submitted to Congress. OMB also would have to offer recommendations to Congress and the President about how to reform regulatory programs that are not a "sound use of national resources."  This is a sensible first step toward improving oversight and promoting greater efficiency throughout the federal regulatory system.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This proposal will be criticized by federal regulators and politicians. Regulation is one of the most politically convenient ways to carry out public policy because it typically does not require substantial, direct taxation or government spending. This is particularly appealing in an era of federal budgetary restraint. The Clinton Administration has put at least 10,000 new pages of federal rules on the books since 1993. But how much has this cost, and what did the American people get for their money?  Because regulators gain power by regulating as much as possible, with little to stop them from regulating as if it cost nothing, opponents will use the same misleading rhetoric against this proposal that they used to defeat a far more comprehensive regulatory reform bill in 1995. The following three myths are typical:
<p>
<b>MYTH #1: It is doubtful that reliable estimates of costs and benefits can be developed.
<p>
<ul>REALITY:</b> There is no dearth of methodological tools available for estimating the costs and benefits of federal regulations. The Department of Commerce regularly surveys business establishments to collect information on expenditures caused by particular regulatory programs. Since 1981, every President has required federal agencies to consider costs and benefits in their regulatory decisionmaking. To assist them, OMB developed guidelines for such analysis. Even though federal agencies try to avoid any effort to measure the costs and benefits of their actions, dozens of these analyses have been done over the last 15 years. Between 1990 and 1995, for example, EPA did at least 70 rule-specific cost-benefit analyses. Ironically, in 1993, the Clinton Administration removed hundreds of rules from OMB review, de-emphasizing the need for cost-benefit analysis.
</ul><p>
<b>MYTH #2: Any attempt to measure the costs and benefits of regulations will consume a significant amount of new resources.
<p>
<ul>REALITY:</b> With more than 130,000 federal regulators spending more than $14 billion annually to develop and enforce regulations, how can more be needed?  The Clinton Administration itself recognizes that federal agencies -- which have been required to consider costs and benefits of regulatory actions since 1981 -- "are the repositories of significant substantive expertise and experience...."  In addition, OMB's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, which reviews rules before they are issued, has a fiscal 1996 budget of more than $5 million and a staff of about 30 analysts and economists with years of experience reviewing and evaluating agency cost-benefit analyses. During the Bush Administration, OMB reported on the aggregate costs of regulations in a publication that later was stopped by the Clinton Administration; no such information has been published since then.<sup>2</sup>  OMB already is in an excellent position to work with other agencies to prepare this statement, but Congress must demand that it be done and that it be made available to the public.
</ul><p>
<b>MYTH #3: This is just the first step in an effort to justify a "roll back" of important public health, safety, and environmental protections.
<p>
<ul>REALITY:</b> The opposite would be true. Strengthening the use of cost-benefit analysis in regulatory decisionmaking would mean higher levels of protection. A recent Harvard study estimated that current regulation of health risks is so inefficient that for the same investment of resources, we could save an additional 636,000 years of life--60,200 premature deaths every year-- simply by changing our priorities.
<p></ul>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Clinton Administration and its allies in Congress already are on record as supporting regulatory cost accounting as part of more comprehensive regulatory reform legislation in 1995. In addition, President Clinton's Executive Order 12866 on Regulatory Planning and Review requires federal agencies to "assess the costs and benefits" of regulations. The Stevens amendment simply suggests that the numbers should be added up so the American people can have some idea of the kinds of regulatory decisions their government is making and how good a job federal regulators are doing.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This is a good first step, and Congress must go further and implement a regulatory budget like the one proposed in <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.3277:">H.R. 3277</a> by Representative Lamar Smith (R-TX). A regulatory budget would force federal regulators to operate within limits, much as an agency's fiscal budget does. Both Congress and the President would be accountable to the public for making sure that economic resources are allocated in a manner that produces the greatest benefit to society.

<title>OPIC-ing the Taxpayer's Pocket - Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3><font size="+2">OPIC</font>-ING THE TAXPAYER'S POCKET</h3>
By Brett D. Schaefer<br>
Research Assistant<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 458<br>
September 3, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

When it returns from its August recess, the House of Representatives is expected to consider H.R. 3759, the Exports, Jobs, and Growth Act of 1996, which authorizes appropriations for the Trade and Development Agency (TDA) and export programs of the International Trade Administration (ITA) for fiscal years 1997 and 1998. But the heart of the Act extends the authority of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) to engage in new commitments through 2001 and doubles the statutory limits on OPIC's insurance and financing activities.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

OPIC insures overseas investments by U.S. businesses against loss to expropriation, political instability, and unforeseen contingencies, such as currency inconvertibility. It also issues investment guarantees and direct loans to U.S. businesses for international investments. The agency was created by the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to complement the federal government's trade policy and development activities. Specifically, OPIC is charged with increasing U.S. exports and assisting American private capital in the development of less developed countries (LDCs) and countries in transition from non-market to market economies.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Strangely, no one seems to notice the irony of using a government-run program to encourage other countries to end government interference in their economies. Congress should not expand OPIC's funding and authority. OPIC is another form of corporate welfare and accomplishes nothing that cannot be performed better in the private sector, without risk to U.S. taxpayers.
<p><ul>
<li><b>OPIC could cost U.S. taxpayers billions of dollars.</b> Proponents insist that OPIC makes a profit and actually decreases the deficit. But while OPIC did make $167 million in profits last year, largely from revenues of U.S. treasury bonds, this figure does not take into account the amount that U.S. taxpayers are obligated to pay as underwriters of OPIC-insured investments. In 1995 alone, OPIC issued policies covering $8.6 billion of investment. The accumulated value of insured investments is many times this amount. American taxpayers typically are liable for 90 percent of the insured investment in the event the policy must be paid.
<p>
Additionally, beginning in 1987, OPIC began dabbling in venture capital, one of the riskiest areas of the financial industry. Starting with the Africa Growth Fund, OPIC began creating numerous funds to encourage investment in less developed countries. These funds have several things in common: They are involved in the world's riskiest markets, are subject to little control or oversight by OPIC, and rarely turn a profit. These funds also have been growing precipitously, from $70 million at the beginning of the Clinton Administration to over $814 million last spring.
<p>
<li><b>OPIC "socializes" risk while privatizing profits. </b>Foreign investment is an important avenue for development in LDCs. U.S. foreign direct investment totaled $612 billion in 1994, with nearly one-third invested in the developing world, a total far exceeding the U.S. foreign aid budget. OPIC insured a very modest portion of this investment; the rest was insured by private businesses. Yet business and political advocates continue to argue that developing nations would not receive foreign direct investment without OPIC. The truth is that OPIC has become a corporate welfare program that subsidizes investment insurance and loans for private businesses. <i>Fortune</i> 500 companies realize large profits while the taxpayer buys the insurance to offset their investment risk in less developed countries.
<p>
<li><b>OPIC's development agenda has been ignored.</b> H.R. 3759 uses export promotion to justify increasing OPIC's insurance and lending authority, but discussion of OPIC's second mission -- its development agenda -- is curiously absent. This is because OPIC actually works against the best interests of LDCs. Representative Sonny Callahan (R-AL) claims that "as long as these countries, such as India, do not have a track record of adherence to free market principles, OPIC is needed."  In fact, however, OPIC is not needed. It encourages countries to maintain harmful economic policies, such as refusing to guarantee property rights, engaging in harmful regulatory policies, demanding oversight of investments, and insisting on government ownership of whole sectors of the economy. It simply is not wise to engage in business in such an environment. To attract foreign investment, countries need to enact free-market economic policies. Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, Chile, and the Czech Republic have done so with marvelous success. However, OPIC continues to encourage investment in less developed countries regardless of their economic climate.
<p>
<li><b>OPIC does not promote exports effectively.</b> Not one country receiving OPIC insurance policies or loans is among the top 10 destinations of U.S. exports, despite the fact that four of the top ten (Mexico, South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore) are developing nations. OPIC focuses on countries that cannot attract foreign investment on their own because of their poor economic policies and dangerous instability. Instead of letting these countries reap what they sow, OPIC rewards them with investments underwritten by American taxpayers.
<p>
Additionally, OPIC employs many restrictions on its lending and insuring practices that have nothing to do with the viability of the investment. For example, many countries that fit the normal criteria for OPIC political insurance and loans are ineligible because they do not meet U.S. standards in such areas as human rights, environmental concerns, and workers' rights. Countries that are excluded from OPIC lending for these reasons include South Korea, China, Hong Kong, and Mexico. In other words, political correctness is more important than maximizing the return on taxpayers' money.
<p>
<li><b>OPIC competes with the private sector.</b> One of the justifications for OPIC is that there supposedly are no alternatives in the private sector. But numerous private-sector businesses specialize in political risk insurance, including American International Group (AIG), EXEL Ltd., and Mid Ocean Ltd. OPIC competes directly with these private-sector institutions and offers advantages beyond the resources of privately held companies. OPIC political risk insurance is backed by the U.S. government, whose resources far exceed those of a private insurer. OPIC offers subsidized insurance premiums at rates far below market rates. OPIC policies extend for 20 years, while the private sector in most instances cannot issue policies for longer than three or seven years for reasons of risk. OPIC continues to compete unfairly with the private sector, despite the fact that its authorizing language instructs it specifically to promote the development of private-sector political risk insurers.
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

At the very least, OPIC should be required to limit its activities to those which complement rather than undermine the activities of private-sector political risk insurers. OPIC, for example, could supplement private political risk insurance by issuing policies for the time window beyond that typically offered by the private sector. Ideally, however, OPIC should be eliminated and its commitments privatized.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Proponents claim that OPIC cannot easily be privatized. To bolster this claim, they cite an independent study which estimated that privatization would cost American taxpayers between $500 million and $700 million. This is a large sum, but it pales in comparison to the potential cost to U.S. taxpayers if major economic or political upheavals occur in areas of the world with OPIC-insured projects. The potential liability to the U.S. is in the billions -- in effect, a global version of the savings and loan debacle of the 1980s, for which the American taxpayer is still paying.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The U.S. government should not intrude in areas where the private sector is willing and able to do the job, can do it more efficiently, and can do it without forcing American taxpayers to underwrite risky ventures. Encouraging foreign investment is an admirable goal, but it should not come in the form of government subsidies to private U.S. firms -- subsidies that discourage economic reform in the target countries and put the American taxpayer at risk.

<h3>HOW MILWAUKEE'S CHOICE PROGRAM HELPS POOR CHILDREN SUCCEED IN SCHOOL</h3>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

School choice for poor children is likely to be an issue this year in many state and congressional races. The idea that low-income parents should be able to select the schools -- public or private -- they think best for their children strikes at the very heart of America's educational <i>status quo</i>. Lawmakers and parents therefore need to pay close attention to the quality of academic evaluations of school choice programs, including the samples used and methodologies employed. Evaluations of the Milwaukee, Wisconsin, school choice experiment are a case in point.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In 1990, Milwaukee instituted the nation's first publicly funded school choice program, giving low-income parents vouchers to send their children to private schools. In February 1996, data from the Milwaukee school choice experiment were made available. Professors Jay P. Greene of the University of Houston Center for Public Policy and Paul E. Peterson of Harvard University's Program in Education Policy and Governance have conducted a detailed assessment of this information.<sup>1</sup>  Their study, released at a conference this summer, reveals that:
<p><ul>
<li> The reading scores of choice students in their third and fourth years were, on average, from 3 to 5 percentile points higher, respectively, than those of comparable low-income public school students.
<p>
<li> Math scores, on average, were 5 and 12 percentile points higher for the third and fourth years, respectively.
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The implications of these findings are extremely significant. As Greene and Peterson note, "If similar success could be achieved for all minority students nationwide, it could close the gap separating white and minority test scores by somewhere between one-third and more than one-half."<sup>2</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Before the release of the Greene and Peterson study, the Milwaukee school choice program had been evaluated each year by the man who designed it: political science professor John Witte of the University of Wisconsin at Madison. Witte had concluded that "This school experiment [has] not yet led to more effective schools.... Choice creates enormous enthusiasm among parents... but student achievement fails to rise."<sup>3</sup>  Because Witte and his fellow researchers did not release their data for secondary analysis by other members of the academic community until this year, their evaluation was the sole source of information on the test performance of Milwaukee school choice students. Many academic specialists, foundations, and policymakers therefore had concluded that while school choice clearly satisfied parents, it was not effective in improving the education of low-income central-city students.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Based on their own examination of the data, however, Greene and Peterson found that the statistical model used by Witte and his colleagues failed to replicate the "character" of the MSCP experiment. The most significant flaw was that Witte's group compared choice school students with a much less disadvantaged cross-section of Milwaukee public school students. Witte had compared the choice students to a general sample of public school students, a group which was significantly different in several ways. For example, the choice students were more likely to come from households headed by poor, minority, single mothers, making any comparison between them and the public school sample misleading.<sup>4</sup>  Correcting for these errors, Greene, Peterson, and their colleagues at the University of Houston and Harvard designed their own study -- a study which confirms a growing collection of evidence showing that private school vouchers are the key to educational success for students who are financially trapped in failing inner-city public school systems.
<p>
<b>HOW THE HOUSTON-HARVARD STUDY WAS DONE</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Greene and Peterson designed an analysis that would correct for the methodological errors of the Witte study. The difference between their conclusions and Witte's is the result of a scientific methodology made more rigorous in several ways. Among them:
<p><ul>
<li><b> Random assignment of students to the test and control groups.</b>
<p>
The Houston-Harvard analysis compared the choice students with students who applied to the choice program but were not admitted. The mandate imposed on the Milwaukee voucher program by the Wisconsin state legislature required Milwaukee's choice schools, if oversubscribed, to admit applicants at random; the result was two randomly selected groups of students: those who were chosen to participate in the program and those who were not. The system thus set up a unique opportunity for researchers to compare students in the choice program with public school students from otherwise eligible families whose parents had made an effort to seek an education for them at a private school. This improved "control" for the extent to which families value education and desire to participate in the program meant that any differences in outcome could reasonably be attributed to the experimental condition of choice. 
<p>
<li><b> Controlling for grade, year, and school.</b>
<p>
Students seeking to participate in the Milwaukee choice program applied each year for a place in a particular grade in a particular school (with spots, as indicated above, to be assigned randomly if the program was oversubscribed). The evaluation data allowed the Houston-Harvard researchers to control for both the grade to which a student applied and the year of application. Although the specific schools to which students applied were not included in the data, researchers were able to control for that variable by taking into account the ethnicity of applicants. Over 80 percent of the choice students attended one of three schools; and virtually all of the students who applied to one of these schools were Hispanic, while virtually all who applied to the other two were African American.<sup>5</sup>  The Witte study had failed to take into account that the selection of students was random only by grade, school, and year.
<p>
<li><b> Measuring academic effects as cumulative.</b>
<p>
Rather than merely measure the changes in test scores from year to year as Witte did, the Houston-Harvard researchers measured the cumulative effect of the choice program on test scores for each child for the entire time the child was in the program. Controlling for gender, the test scores of choice students were compared with those of "non-selected" students who had applied the same year for the same grade and were of the same ethnicity. The effects of choice schools on test performance were small during the first and second years; during the third and fourth, however, choice students made substantial gains. According to statistical tests, positive results of this magnitude would not appear had Milwaukee choice schools had no effect on academic performance. One of the most egregious errors of the Witte study was that it controlled for a student's test score in the prior year, in effect controlling for the outcomes of the choice program and incorrectly assuming that students learn at uniform rates.
<p>
<li><b>Testing for possible errors due to limited data.</b>
<p>
As Professor Witte states, "In terms of demographic characteristics, non-selected... students [and choice students] came from very similar homes....  They were also similar in terms of prior achievement scores and parental involvement."<sup>6</sup>  However, the data available to the Houston-Harvard researchers covered only 76.2 percent of the selected students and 58.7 percent of the non-selected students. To ensure that these two percentages accurately represented the selected and non-selected groups overall, the Houston-Harvard researchers made several additional analyses:
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Family background.</b> Controlling for family background was difficult. Both test and background questionnaire data were available for only 36.7 percent of the families of selected students and 21.8 percent of the families of non-selected students. Even among those parents who did return a questionnaire, many did not respond to all of the items. Trying to balance between controlling for additional factors and preserving the size of the sample, the Houston-Harvard team controlled for family income and the mother's education. Those factors were chosen for two reasons: 1) Past academic research shows that these factors strongly affect a child's educational performance, and 2) most parents who returned questionnaires responded to those particular questions. Adding these two variables to the analysis decreased the sample size but changed the results very little. This confirmed that there were no significant differences in family background between those for whom complete background data were available and those for whom they were not.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Prior test scores.</b> Two groups randomly assigned to two categories, as was the case in this study, can be assumed to be similar. Thus, the Houston-Harvard study did not control for test scores prior to the Milwaukee program. Because of missing data, however, the researchers checked and found that at the time these two groups applied to the Milwaukee choice schools, the available data showed that they had essentially the same test scores. In fact, those who were not selected scored one percentile point higher in both reading and math. Although the sample size for this analysis was reduced by the fact that test scores at the time of application were available only for a limited number of applicants, a statistical analysis was run on the figures that were available. With only one exception -- the fourth year reading scores, which had to be based on only 26 observations -- the results controlling for prior test scores were not substantially different from those found in the main analysis. This confirmed that there were no significant academic differences between those students whose prior test scores were reported and those whose scores were not reported.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Potential "selection effects."</b>  The Houston-Harvard study's main analysis clearly revealed statistically significant effects in the third and fourth years of a student's program. This presents two possibilities: 1) Either students benefit in measurable ways from the choice experience only after participating in the program for three or more years, or 2) students remain in the program for three to four years only if they are benefiting from it. To determine which was the case, the Houston-Harvard researchers analyzed the first and second year scores of students for whom test results were also available in years three and four. The effects of the first two years were no different from the effects for all first and second year students. This would imply that the positive effects of school choice accumulate over time and are not due to different student retention rates.
</ul>
<p>
<b>OTHER RELEVANT STUDIES</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Houston-Harvard analysis is more methodologically sound than previous studies of the Milwaukee school choice program. More important, its basic conclusions are supported by a growing body of research on the value of private schools among urban poor and minority children.
In 1990, the Rand Corporation of Santa Monica, California, examined the academic performance of children in New York City's public and Catholic school systems. The results were startling: Some 95 percent of Catholic high school students graduated, for example, while only 25 percent made it out of the public schools. Similarly, 75 percent of Catholic students took the Scholastic Aptitude Test, but only 16 percent took it in the public schools.<sup>7</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

A 1982 study headed by education scholar James Coleman of the University of Chicago found that students in Catholic schools were one grade level ahead of their public school counterparts in mathematics, reading, and vocabulary.<sup>8</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In 1993, the New York State Department of Education found that Catholic schools with 81 percent to 100 percent minority composition outscored New York City public schools with the same percentage of minority enrollment in Grade 3 reading (+17 percent), Grade 3 mathematics (+10 percent), Grade 5 writing (+6 percent), Grade 6 reading (+10 percent), and Grade 6 mathematics (+11 per cent).<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Although the 1993 New York State Department of Education study also found that Catholic and public schools have similar percentages of students from troubled families with low incomes, Anthony Bryk from the University of Chicago reports that Catholic schools expel far fewer children.<sup>10</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Derek Neal, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago, in a study conducted for the National Bureau of Economic Research in Cambridge, Massachusetts, found that among urban blacks and Hispanics nationwide, the probability of high school graduation rises from 62 percent to 88 percent when a student is moved from a public to a Catholic high school. The probability of college graduation for these children rises from 11 percent to 27 percent. In addition, when compared with their public school counterparts, minority students in urban Catholic schools can expect roughly 8 percent higher wages in the future simply because they are more likely to complete high school and college.<sup>11</sup>

<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
School choice is becoming increasingly popular, and polls show it is most popular among urban African Americans --  the very group served by a program like Milwaukee's. Because black parents are less satisfied with public schools, they want an alternative. A recent study by the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a Washington-based think tank that specializes in research on African Americans, found that only 5.7 percent of African Americans rated their local public schools "excellent," compared with 19.9 percent of the general population. Conversely, 16.5 percent of the black sample rated their schools "poor," compared with only 7.4 percent of the general population.<sup>12</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Contrary to the claims of the education establishment, choice does not leave children of poor families in failing schools. Rather, it is their ticket out. Schools of choice have proven their ability -- and their desire -- to improve the academic outcomes of poor children. Recently, Cardinal John J. O'Connor of New York offered to take the lowest performing 5 percent of students in New York City's public schools into New York's Catholic schools, where they can succeed. This also would be a huge financial advantage for taxpayers. New York's Catholic schools educate students at about a third of the cost of public schools. A 5 percent transfer would save New York City over $250 million a year.<sup>13</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The academic success of Milwaukee choice students, as well as other students who have been fortunate enough to escape failing urban schools, is now a matter of record. It is time for state legislators and Members of Congress to give other lower-income children the same opportunity.

<title>Tougher U.S. Action Needed to Punish Saddam Hussein - Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3>TOUGHER U.S. ACTION NEEDED TO PUNISH SADDAM HUSSEIN</h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/phillips.htm">James Phillips</a><br>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Clinton Administration's cruise missile strikes against Iraq this week in retaliation for Saddam Hussein's military offensive against the Kurdish enclave in northern Iraq are too little too late. The U.S. needs to take firm, consistent, and systematic action if it is to rebuff Saddam's latest aggression, undermine his brutal regime, and undercut his ability to threaten his neighbors and repress his own people. In responding to the immediate crisis, the U.S. needs to keep sight of its long-term goals -- forcing Saddam's downfall and diminishing Iraq's threats to regional stability and the flow of oil.
<p>

<b>WHAT IS AT STAKE?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Saddam's invasion of the Kurdish enclave is not just a blow aimed at Kurdish and other Iraqi opposition forces; it is a clear test of the U.S.-led coalition's determination to contain Iraq. Saddam knows that the Kurdish cause is unpopular in Turkey, which is fighting its own Kurdish separatists, and among America's Arab allies, who wish to preserve Iraq as a counterweight to Iran. Saddam hopes to drive a wedge between the U.S. and other members of the anti-Iraq coalition by portraying his aggression as a defensive move against Iranian-supported Kurdish separatists.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Iraq's latest provocation also is an inevitable consequence of an aggressive dictator's perception of U.S. weakness. For three-and-a-half years, the Clinton Administration has conveyed an image of weakness and indecision in defense and foreign policy, particularly regarding Iraq. Clinton came into office severely underestimating the threat posed by Saddam Hussein. One week before his inauguration, Clinton offered Saddam the chance to let bygones be bygones in a <i>New York Times</i> interview: "I'm a Baptist; I believe in deathbed conversions."  Clinton proclaimed that he was "not obsessed with Iraq," as if bilateral tensions were a product of George Bush's personal pique toward Saddam. The Clinton Administration softened U.S. policy toward Iraq and dropped the Bush Administration's insistence that Saddam be ousted before the U.S. would agree to lift the United Nations embargo on trade with Iraq.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
When Iraq launched a failed attempt to assassinate former President Bush in Kuwait in April 1993, the Administration equivocated before launching cruise missile attacks against the Baghdad headquarters of Iraq's foreign intelligence agency on June 27, 1993. This attack was a mere slap on the wrist for such a brazen terrorist plot against a former American President. The limited size and symbolic nature of the U.S. reprisal -- 24 cruise  missiles fired at an empty building in the middle of the night -- probably did little to strengthen U.S. deterrence against Saddam's aggression.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
More recently, the Clinton Administration has failed to respond to other Iraqi provocations. Since April, Baghdad repeatedly has blocked the efforts of U.N. arms inspectors to monitor compliance with Iraq's obligations to dismantle its nuclear, chemical, biological, and long-range missile programs. Yet the Administration has done little except to pass the problem off to a listless U.N. Security Council. In May, Iraqi opposition leaders reportedly warned U.S. officials that the situation in Iraqi Kurdistan was deteriorating and required urgent American attention. But the Administration was asleep at the switch and failed to resolve diplomatically the growing tensions between Kurdish factions that erupted in open warfare last month. One faction, the Kurdish Democratic Party, then went so far as to ally itself with Saddam, who has ordered the deaths of thousands of Kurds, in despair over its failure to receive significant material or diplomatic support from Washington.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Saddam has probed aggressively for U.S. weakness, again and again. What is at stake in the current crisis is not just the future of Iraq's Kurds, but the ability of the U.S. and its allies to deter future Iraqi aggression.
<p>
<b>THE U.S. RESPONSE: WHAT NEXT?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Clinton Administration has responded correctly with military force, the only language Saddam Hussein seems to understand. But the limited cruise missile strikes launched so far make sense only as the opening phase of a robust and systematic air campaign to punish Saddam's aggression, weaken his military threat to his neighbors, and deter future Iraqi aggression. Incremental pinprick reprisals are unlikely to make Saddam blink. Such attacks more likely will encourage him to escalate the crisis even further.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To drive home to Saddam the heavy price that he must pay for aggression, the Clinton Administration should hit the Iraqi dictator where he will feel it most. The U.S. should launch cruise missile and air strikes against the security forces that prop up Saddam's dictatorship -- the Republican Guard and secret police -- as well as against Iraq's military assets and military industries. The U.S. goal should be to punish Saddam and his closest supporters while undermining his ability to maintain himself in power, repress the opposition, and threaten Iraq's neighbors. The Administration also should seize the opportunity to destroy suspected Iraqi weapons manufacturing and storage facilities that were barred to U.N. arms inspectors. This will make the Iraqis think twice before illegally interfering with such inspections in the future.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Administration's decision to expand the southern "no fly" zone from the 32nd parallel to the 33rd is wise because it tightens the constraints on Iraq's air force and diminishes Iraq's military threat to Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. Moreover, it drives home to Saddam and the Iraqi military that the U.S. has the will to impose significant costs for aggression on a broad range of fronts, including imposing humiliating restrictions on Iraq's military operations. This will increase the incentives for a military coup against Saddam by disgruntled army officers concerned with rebuilding Iraq's military strength, especially if U.S. air attacks weaken the Republican Guard, which is an elite military force that is loyal to Saddam.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Washington must insist on the immediate and total withdrawal of Iraqi troops from the Kurdish areas. But the U.S. should not focus exclusively on compelling an Iraqi withdrawal. Saddam could pull back his troops a few miles and still use his feared secret police to maintain control of the areas he has occupied. He also could easily move his troops back into the area in the future. Moreover, focusing primarily on the Kurdish issue will only help Saddam split the already weakened anti-Iraq coalition. The issue for the U.S. is not so much protecting the Kurds from Iraqi aggression as diminishing Saddam's ability to engage in <i>any</i> act of military aggression with impunity.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
If Saddam continues his aggression in Kurdistan or engages in new provocations elsewhere, the Clinton Administration should mount a methodical and sustained air campaign against military, military industry, and secret police targets throughout Iraq as long as Saddam's troops remain in the Kurdish enclave. The Administration also should mount a high-priority diplomatic offensive to end the factional fighting between the rival Kurdish groups. But the U.S. should avoid basing its policy exclusively on the narrow issues of protecting the Kurds or enforcing U.N. resolutions. This would only play into Saddam's hands by allowing him to retain the initiative. U.S. policy should be focused on punishing Saddam, deterring future aggression, and destroying his ability to threaten more important U.S. interests in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.

<h3>WHAT THE 104TH CONGRESS DID TO COMBAT CRIME</h3>

F.Y.I. No. 117<br>
August 19, 1996<br>

</center>



<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The 104th Congress has delivered on its promise to enact specific measures to improve federal crime-fighting efforts and help state and local officials combat violent crime. Most of these anti-crime measures were initiated by conservative Members of the House of Representatives, based on promises made to the taxpayers in the Contract With America, and later incorporated into bills passed by the Senate. They include a solid program of truth in sentencing for violent criminals, effective death penalty provisions, restrictions on the power of federal judges to put criminals back on the streets, a reordering of federal funding from social programs to law enforcement efforts (including prison construction and police funding), and victim restitution.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The two major vehicles for enactment of most of these measures were the comprehensive Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (S. 735), sponsored by former Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-KS), and the FY 1996 Omnibus Appropriations Act (H.R. 3019). While more can be done at the federal level, more also needs to be done by state and local officials who bear the primary responsibility for fighting violent street crime.<sup>2</sup>  Nonetheless, the legislative record of the 104th Congress in combating crime is impressive and far-reaching.<p><b>KEEPING THE BAD GUYS OFF THE STREETS</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The first duty of government is to protect the people. As a short-term measure, the most effective way to do this is to put more violent criminals in prison and keep them there. In fulfilling this duty, Congress enacted the following measures into law:
<p>
<b>Violent Criminal Incarceration Act of 1995 (H.R. 667).</b> A major failure of the criminal justice system has been the inability or unwillingness to identify, target, and incarcerate violent criminals for long periods of time. Violent criminals typically serve only one-third of their sentences.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Under this new law, states will receive Truth in Sentencing Incentive Grants for the construction of prisons on condition that they keep violent criminals locked up for at least 85 percent of their sentences. Already, more than 20 states have adopted such truth-in-sentencing laws,<sup>3</sup> and it is likely that many more will adopt such measures to keep violent criminals behind bars and off the streets.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The bill passed the House of Representatives on February 10, 1995; was incorporated into the FY 1996 Omnibus Appropriations Act (H.R. 3019); and was signed into law by President Clinton as Public Law 104-134.
<p>
<b>Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995.</b> During the past three decades, federal judges have seized control of state and even local prisons, dictating conditions of confinement, promoting more comfortable living conditions for convicts, and releasing inmates as a way to ease overcrowding. Federal judges have been releasing inmates without finding a violation of a specific federal or constitutional right. Over 500 municipalities and 1,200 state prisons have been operating under judicial orders or consent decrees. Under Section 3626 of the 1994 federal crime bill, Congress attempted to stop lenient federal judges from imposing caps on the number of prisoners that can be incarcerated at a particular prison,<sup>4</sup> a judicial practice that has resulted in the release of violent criminals before their terms have been served.<sup>5</sup>  Liberal lawyers and judges quickly found ways to get around this provision.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Prison Litigation Reform Act, originally sponsored by Representative Bill McCollum (R-FL), closes existing loopholes by imposing tighter restrictions on federal court-ordered prison population caps. It requires a three-judge panel to find that prison crowding is the primary cause of the violation of a prisoner's legal or constitutional rights. Moreover, it requires judges to find that there is no other remedy available before they impose a prison cap. State or local officials responsible for the prosecution or custody of criminals who could be released because of judicially imposed prison caps are granted standing to sue. The Prison Litigation Reform Act also specifies that court-ordered relief from incarceration is to be based on specific violations of a prisoner's constitutional rights and that federal judges must give substantial weight in their decisions to any adverse impact of such relief on public safety or on the operation of the criminal justice system.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This measure also reduces the burden of frivolous prisoner lawsuits, which include a wide range of often strange and bizarre complaints. Inmate lawsuits are estimated to comprise 25 percent of all civil suits filed in federal courts, and state officials are burdened with responding to them. Missouri Attorney General Jay Nixon has compiled a "top ten" list of the most frivolous of these lawsuits, including complaints against officials who do not provide salad bars and brunches on weekends and holidays, officials who do not pay food allowances of $26 a day to inmates traveling from prison to the courthouse, and officials who do not permit male inmates to wear such female apparel as bras, panties, lipstick, and artificial fingernails.<sup>6</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Under the new law, federal courts are authorized to dismiss frivolous or malicious suits "without hearing."  Moreover, all administrative solutions within the corrections system must be exhausted before a lawsuit can be filed in federal court. The measure also limits the lawyers' fees awarded to successful inmate plaintiffs. In the past, trial lawyers have received as much as $300 per hour for representing prisoners.<sup>7</sup>  Under this Act, fees will be based on an hourly rate no higher than that for other court-appointed counsel, and any monetary damages awarded to a prisoner in a successful suit against state prison authorities must be applied to outstanding restitution owed to the victims of his crimes.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Prison Litigation Reform Act was incorporated into the FY 1996 Omnibus Appropriations Act (H.R. 3019) and signed into law as Public Law 104-134.
<p>
<b>To disapprove certain sentencing guideline amendments (H.R. 2259/S. 1254).</b> This law, originally sponsored by Senator Spencer Abraham (R-MI), requires the U.S. Sentencing Commission to submit new guidelines imposing higher penalties for crack cocaine than powder cocaine, and higher sentences for "high level" as opposed to "low level" drug trafficking. It rejects previous guidelines that would have lowered penalties for crack cocaine to those for powder cocaine. The law stipulates that new guidelines also should include stiffer penalties for drug traffickers who use a dangerous weapon, possess a firearm, or involve or injure children or other vulnerable individuals when committing an offense.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This bill passed the Senate on September 29, 1995; passed the House of Representatives on October 18, 1995; and was signed into law by President Clinton as Public Law 104-38.
<p>


<b>MAKING PUNISHMENT SWIFT AND SURE</b><p>
<b>The Alien Deportation Improvement Act of 1995 (H.R. 668).</b> Originally sponsored by Representative McCollum, this law would expedite deportation procedures for non-resident aliens convicted of serious felonies, as well as bribery, counterfeiting, trafficking in stolen vehicles, perjury or subornation of perjury. It also would permit deportation of a permanent resident alien who has been sentenced to five or more years for an aggravated felony.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This measure, originally titled the Criminal Alien Deportation Improvements Act of 1995, was passed by the House of Representatives on February 10, 1995, and later incorporated into the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-132).
<p>
<b>Effective Death Penalty Act of 1995 (H.R. 779).</b> While there is considerable debate over the ethics or wisdom of imposing the death penalty, the empirical evidence indicates that the death penalty in the United States is used sparingly. In 1995, there were 2,976 criminals on death row, but the states have executed 263 criminals since 1973. The abuse of <i>habeas corpus</i>, enabling those on death row to file petition after petition seeking to overturn their sentences or convictions, has been a major weakness of the American criminal justice system.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This measure reduces delays in carrying out capital sentences while preserving the right of those convicted of capital crimes to present valid claims in federal court. It also imposes time limits for the filing and judicial consideration of petitions; ends the practice of filing multiple petitions except in the rarest instances; requires that state prisoners seeking <i>habeas corpus</I> relief must exhaust all state remedies before bringing action in federal court; and specifies that if a state gives reasonable consideration to the petitioner's claim, the federal judge must deny that claim.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Effective Death Penalty Act of 1995 was passed by the House of Representatives on February 8, 1995; incorporated into the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 by the Senate; and signed into law by President Clinton as part of Public Law 104-132.
<p>


<b>HELPING LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The central congressional approach to law enforcement assistance is the block grant, which allows local law enforcement officials to secure more funds, hire more police personnel, and have even more flexibility in using these monies to combat crime at the local level.
<p>
<b>Local Government Law Enforcement Block Grants Act of 1995 (H.R. 728).</b> This measure authorizes federal grants for local law enforcement officers while giving them the flexibility they need to fight crime in ways they deem most appropriate for their communities. Unlike the police funding in the 1994 crime bill, these funds are targeted to communities with high crime rates. $503 million has been appropriated for FY 1996.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This bill was passed by the House of Representatives on February 14, 1995; incorporated into the FY 1996 Omnibus Appropriations Act by the Senate; and signed into law by President Clinton as Public Law 104-134.
<p>
<b>Anti-Car Theft Improvements Act (H.R. 2803).</b> This law, originally sponsored by Representative McCollum, advances the investigation of car theft by setting up the National Motor Vehicle Title Information System (NMVTIS). This system, to be managed by the Department of Justice and maintained by the states, is intended to serve as a reliable and accessible body of information on motor vehicle titling for law enforcement officials.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This law was passed by the House of Representatives on June 18, 1996; passed by the Senate on June 20, 1996; and signed into law by President Clinton as Public law 104-152.
<p>

<b>JUSTICE FOR VICTIMS</b><p>

<b>Victim Restitution Act of 1995 (H.R. 665).</b> This law, originally sponsored by Representative McCollum, requires judges in federal felony cases to order restitution to victims in cases involving violent crimes, offenses against property, or tampering with consumer products, as well as crimes in which an identifiable victim has suffered a physical injury or pecuniary loss. The law also authorizes the federal courts to make restitution a condition of probation or parole.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This Act was passed by the House of Representatives on February 7, 1995; passed by the Senate on December 22, 1995, and incorporated into the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996; and signed into law by President Clinton as Public Law 104-132.
<p>
<b>Sexual Crimes Against Children Prevention Act of 1995 (H.R. 1240).</b> Sponsored by Representative McCollum, this law imposes strong sentencing guidelines for criminals convicted of creating or trafficking in child pornography and the interstate transportation of children with the intent to use them in such criminal activity.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
H.R. 1240 was passed by the House on April 4, 1995; passed by the Senate on April 6, 1995; and signed into law by President Clinton as Public Law 104-71.
<p>
<b>Megan's Law (H.R. 2137).</b> Sexually violent criminals often are repeat offenders, and their presence in local communities is an obvious concern for families with children. Under this law, sponsored by Representative Richard Zimmer (R-NJ), criminals convicted of these crimes must register their addresses with state law enforcement officials, and communities will be informed when these offenders move into their neighborhoods.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The bill was passed by the House of Representatives on May 7, 1996; passed by the Senate on May 9, 1996; and signed into law by President Clinton as Public Law 104-145.
<p>
<b>Church Arson Prevention Act of 1996 (H.R. 3525).</b> This new law, sponsored by Representative Henry Hyde (R-IL), makes it a federal crime to damage religious property or obstruct any person's free exercise of religion where the offense is in, or affects, interstate commerce.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
H.R. 3525 was passed by the House of Representatives on June 18, 1996; passed by the Senate on June 26, 1996; and signed into law by President Clinton as Public Law 104-155.

<p>
<b>PENDING ANTI-CRIME LEGISLATION</b>
<p><b>Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1997 (H.R. 3814).</b> This bill provides $680 million for prisons and $571 million for block grants to local law enforcement. It passed the House on July 24, 1996, and currently is before a conference of the House and Senate.
<p>
<b>Interstate Stalking Punishment and Prevention Act of 1996 (H.R. 2980/S. 1729).</b> H.R. 2980 makes it a felony to cross a state line to stalk someone or to cross a state line in violation of a restraining order. The House of Representatives passed this bill on May 7, 1996. S. 1729, an identical bill sponsored by Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), was passed by the Senate.
<p>
<b>Exclusionary Rule Reform Act of 1995 (H.R. 666).</b> This bill, sponsored by Representative McCollum, would establish an exception to the exclusionary rule, which bars the use at trial of any evidence gathered by police officers in violation of the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable search and seizure. The narrow qualification created by this legislation would allow the admission of evidence obtained by police officers who, while they technically violated proper procedure, acted in the "reasonably objective belief" that their actions under the circumstances complied with Fourth Amendment protections. The bill classifies any information obtained pursuant to, or within the scope of, a warrant as evidence obtained in good faith.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The House of Representatives passed this bill on February 8, 1995. It has been referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee.
<p>
<b>Violent Youth Predator Act of 1996 (H.R. 3565).</b> This bill, also sponsored by Representative McCollum, would allow federal prosecutors to try violent juvenile offenders as adults. It also includes tough, mandatory sentences for juvenile criminals who use firearms in the commission of a federal violent crime or drug trafficking offense, and authorizes additional funding for juvenile justice programs and grants to states, allowing them greater flexibility in combating the growth of violent juvenile crime. The bill was marked up by the House Judiciary Committee on July 16 and 17, 1996, and referred to the House Economic and Educational Opportunities Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Youth, and Families, which approved sections under its jurisdiction.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In the United States Senate, John Ashcroft (R-MO) introduced S. 1245, a similar bill. The Subcommittee on Youth Violence of the Senate Judiciary Committee has held hearings on the Ashcroft bill.
<p>
<b>Sexual Offender Tracking and Identification Act of 1996 (S. 1675/H.R. 3456).</b> This bill would enhance the federal effort to track convicted sex offenders. Cosponsored by Senators Phil Gramm (R-TX) and Joseph Biden (D-DE), the legislation would establish a federal tracking system, accessible to the public, to document the location of sex offenders, making it more difficult for these criminals to hide their records when applying for jobs, housing, or youth service programs. A version of the bill has been introduced in the House of Representatives by Representative Zimmer. Hearings on the bill have been held before the Subcommittee on Crime of the House Judiciary Committee.

<title>High Layoffs and Long-Term Unemployment Cloud Jobs Picture - Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center><h3> HIGH LAYOFFS AND LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYMENT CLOUD JOBS PICTURE </h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/wilson.htm">Mark Wilson</a>, Rebecca Lukens Fellow in Labor Policy <br>
<p>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
F.Y.I. No. 115<br>
August 5, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
<a href="/heritage/library/categories/regulation/fyi115c1.gif">Chart 1:</a> Announced Layoffs for the First Six Months of 1996 Continue at Rapid Pace<br>
<a href="/heritage/library/categories/regulation/fyi115c2.gif">Chart 2:</a> Compared with Previous Economic Expansions, Long-Term Unemployment Remains High<br>
<a href="/heritage/library/categories/regulation/fyi115c3.gif">Chart 3:</a> Manufacturing Employment Has Declined for the Last Year and Remains 6.2 Percent Below 1989<br>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Since the end of the last recession in March 1991, the total number of payroll jobs has grown by 11.4 million to a total of 119.7 million, and the unemployment rate has declined from 6.8 to 5.4 percent. Despite this good news, many workers continue to be apprehensive about their economic future. In fact, one of every five Americans believes jobs are hard to get, and well over one of every ten believes there will be fewer jobs in the future.<sup>1</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

A look at the data behind the total number of jobs created and overall unemployment rates reveals why Americans are concerned.<ul>

<p><li>Announced job layoffs continue at a rapid pace, with layoffs at near record levels for the 1990s. Displaced workers who did find new jobs did so at an average of 8.2 percent lower wages.

<p><li>Long-term unemployment remains stubbornly high. The percentage of long-term unemployed is at record levels for this stage of an economic expansion.

<p><li>Overall real earnings growth is stagnating, and men's real earnings continue to decline.

<p><li>The number of high-paying manufacturing jobs continues to decline -- down 282,000 since March 1995 -- and weak economic growth is limiting job opportunities for many Americans.
Focusing on just the total number of new jobs and the low overall unemployment rate without taking these sobering facts into account paints a misleading picture of economic growth and job opportunities.<sup>2</sup>  The economy is still failing to perform as well as similar expansions.


</ul><p>
<b>ANNOUNCED LAYOFFS CONTINUE AT RAPID PACE</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
After a flurry of press attention last winter, the continued pace of corporate downsizing has gone largely unnoticed. Despite this, many workers remain concerned about their job security. One-half of all Americans believe that jobs are not very plentiful,<sup>3</sup> and 46 percent believe the economy is getting worse.<sup>4</sup>  New jobs may be available, but they usually pay substantially less and may not have the same benefits.<ul>

<p><li>Announced job layoffs for the first six months of 1996 were the second-highest this decade (see <a href="/heritage/library/categories/regulation/fyi115c1.gif">Chart 1</a>).<sup>5</sup>  Layoffs were 28 percent higher than the first half of 1995 and 6.0 percent ahead of 1993, the largest downsizing year of the decade.

<p><li>So far this year, the telecommunications industry has announced layoffs totaling almost 43,000; the food industry, over 25,000; the computer industry, over 22,000; the retail industry, over 21,000; and the automobile industry, almost 18,000.

<p><li>The median weekly earnings of displaced workers who found new jobs were 8.2 percent less than for their old jobs.<sup>6</sup>  They were over 14 percent less for workers 45 to 55 years old. One of every five displaced workers who found new jobs was no longer covered by group health insurance.
</ul>

<p>
<b>LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYMENT REMAINS HIGH</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

How long Americans are unemployed (duration) is just as important as the level of unemployment. An unemployment rate of 7.5 percent with most workers out of work for only a week as they change jobs or are recalled from layoff is significantly better than an unemployment rate of 5.5 percent with many workers still struggling to find work six months after losing their last job. Because of weak economic growth, long-term joblessness has not declined as rapidly as it normally does after recessions.<sup>7</sup>
<ul>
<p><li>Long-term unemployment remains stubbornly high.<sup>8</sup>  <a href="/heritage/library/categories/regulation/fyi115c2.gif">Chart 2</a> shows that the proportion of Americans unemployed for at least six months remains unusually high after five years of modest economic growth. Since the end of the last recession, the proportion of unemployed who have been out of work for six or more months has not dropped significantly for youths (ages 16 to 24), black Americans, and service workers.

<p><li>After six months of looking for work, almost one of every five unemployed managers and professionals still has not found a job.<sup>9</sup>

<p><li>The overall unemployment rate also does not reveal significant problems facing workers in various age groups, industries, or occupations. While the total unemployment rate was 5.4 percent in July 1996, the rate for all teenagers was 16.4 percent, and the rate for black teenagers was 33.1 percent.
</ul>

<p><b>EARNINGS GROWTH STAGNATES, MEN'S EARNINGS STILL DECLINE</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Over the past five years of modest economic recovery and expansion, the real median usual weekly earnings for all full-time wage and salary workers has stagnated.<sup>10</sup>  For men, real median weekly earnings have declined 5.1 percent. For black and Hispanic Americans, the decline has been even worse: 5.4 percent and 8.2 percent, respectively.
<ul>
<p><li>After increasing 2.5 percent from the first quarter of 1991 to the first quarter of 1993, the index of real hourly compensation has not increased.

<p><li>Over the past five years, only workers in the finance, insurance, and real estate industries have seen their real average hourly earnings improve substantially.
</ul><p><b>

WEAK ECONOMIC GROWTH LIMITS JOB OPPORTUNITIES FOR AMERICANS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Although total employment and unemployment numbers are significant, they often do not convey important information about problems various age groups, industries, or occupations may be having. There actually are fewer manufacturing jobs now than when the economic recovery began five years ago, and the dismal pace of economic growth has meant no substantial improvement in job opportunities for men and minorities. Workers in some occupations have not yet regained the ground they lost in the last recession. For example:
<ul>
<p><li>Since March 1991, the percentage of the population employed has increased 1.4 percentage points to 63.2 percent.<sup>11</sup>  The percentage of men employed, however, has increased only 0.5 percentage points and still remains well below its 1989 peak of 72.8 percent.

<p><li>The employment-population ratio for white teenagers has increased 0.7 percentage points to 48.0 percent since March 1991 but remains well below the rate of 53.4 percent reached in August 1989.<sup>12</sup>  Likewise, the employment-population ratio for black teenagers has increased 2.0 percentage points to a disappointing 25.8 percent since March 1991 but remains well below the pre-recession rate of 32.4 percent reached in July 1989.

<p><li>The number of manufacturing jobs has declined 282,000 to 18.3 million since March 1995, and is down almost 1.2 million since its peak in 1989 (see <a href="/heritage/library/categories/regulation/fyi115c3.gif">Chart 3</a>).<sup>13</sup>  Durable goods manufacturing employment has increased only 55,000 over the past five years and remains below its 1989 peak by 794,000 jobs. Manufacturing workers have regained only 1 of every 5 jobs lost between 1989 and 1993.

<p><li>The number of Americans working in high-skilled technician and related occupations has declined 478,000 since July 1992, and the number of workers in administrative support and clerical occupations has declined by 298,000.<sup>14</sup>

<p><li>The number of Americans working in precision production, craft, and repair occupations has declined 13,000 to 13.4 million from March 1991 to July 1996 and remains 519,000 below the peak of 14.0 million reached in March 1990.
</ul><p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Despite the creation of 11.4 million additional jobs since the end of the last recession, workers continue to be concerned about their economic future. The average annual growth rate of the past seven years has been the worst economic performance since the end of World War II.<sup>15</sup>  Layoff announcements for the first half of this year were the second-highest this decade, long-term unemployment remains high, and real earnings growth has stagnated for the past five years. Focusing only on total job growth and the low unemployment rate without taking these facts into account paints a misleading picture of economic growth and job opportunities.

<a href="fyi114c2.gif">Chart 2</a>: Trend and Quarterly Real GDP Growth 1976-1996
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
On August 1, the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) is scheduled to release its preliminary or "advance" gross domestic product (GDP) growth estimate for the second quarter of 1996. This number, good or bad, inevitably will make front-page news and may have a significant impact on the presidential campaign. Just as inevitably, this preliminary number most likely will turn out to be wrong, for quarterly GDP data historically have been subject to substantial later revisions, sometimes so significant that the original estimate tells nothing about the course of the economy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

A single quarter estimate of the growth in GDP usually is a poor signal of the long-term direction of economic growth. Consider the following examples:<ul>

<p><li>The GDP growth estimate for the first quarter of 1996 has been revised downward by 21 percent (from 2.8 percent to 2.2 percent).

<p><li>During the last year of the Bush Administration, the first quarter 1992 advance estimate of GDP suggested an annualized growth rate of 2.0 percent. The subsequent revision of the GDP for that quarter showed that growth in the quarter actually was at an annualized rate of 4.7 percent. This is a 135 percent revision between the preliminary and final estimates.

<p><li>As it turns out, the BEA underestimated the growth rate during the Reagan Administration in 63 percent of its advance estimates. During the Clinton Administration, the BEA so far has overestimated the growth rate on over 69 percent of the occasions on which it published advance estimates.

<p><li>The BEA concedes that in 12 percent of the quarters between 1978 and 1991, the advance GDP growth estimate failed even to indicate correctly whether growth was positive or negative.

<p><li>The average divergence between the advance estimate of GDP growth and the final GDP growth rate between 1976 and 1996 was equivalent to 50 percent of the value of the final GDP growth rate.
</ul>

<p>
<b>WHY DOES QUARTERLY GDP FLUCTUATE SO MUCH?</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Measuring GDP changes is a very complex task, made all the more difficult by the fact that quarterly GDP figures are very volatile.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Gross domestic product (GDP) represents the total value of goods and services sold for final consumption by U.S. firms and individuals. It consists of four major components: personal consumption; investment (including business inventories and both residential and nonresidential fixed investment); net exports; and government purchases of goods and services. Fluctuations in any of these individual components of GDP in a given quarter can cause large changes in the quarterly growth rate. The components which typically have the largest and most common fluctuations are changes in business inventories and in government purchases.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

A glance at the quarterly GDP growth figures for the last quarter of 1995 illustrates this point. Despite an annualized growth rate in personal consumption expenditures of 1.2 percent and a respectable annualized increase in nonresidential fixed investment of 3.1 percent, overall annualized growth in this quarter was at a recession-like low of 0.5 percent. The reason: An annualized fall in government purchases of over 12 percent during the winter shutdown of 1995-1996 drove down GDP during this quarter.<sup>2</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

 Similarly, a number of one-shot factors probably will drive a significant increase in GDP for the second quarter of 1996. One leading econometric consulting firm, the St. Louis-based Macroeconomic Advisers,<sup>3</sup> for example, cite a number of factors to support their prediction of a 3.7 percent annualized growth rate for this quarter. These factors include the complete recovery of government purchases following the winter shutdown, the end of the UAW strike at General Motors, an increase in the number of home mortgage refinancings stimulated by lower interest rates (which put extra cash into the hands of consumers), and the economy's recovery after the harsh winter weather.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The extent to which these short-term factors can influence quarterly growth figures can be gauged by looking more closely at what is happening to business inventories. Due to the GM strike and the harsh winter, business inventories fell substantially in the first quarter of 1996 as production experienced a slowdown. Macroeconomic Advisers predicts that over 38 percent of their projected growth in GDP (1.4 percent from a total annualized growth rate of 3.7 percent) in the second quarter of 1996 will come solely from firms restocking their inventories as production gets fully back on line.
<p>


<b>WHY ADVANCE ESTIMATES OF GDP GROWTH TEND TO BE WRONG</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Measuring GDP is a massive and complicated undertaking that involves attempting to record the total sales of all goods for final consumption for the entire United States. The BEA produces its estimates based on sample sales data from a number of individuals and firms, collected during every month. Prices for thousands of individual items are estimated using sample data. Taken together, these comprise virtually millions of data points.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The problem is that when the advance estimate is published only 30 days after the close of the quarter, not all of these data have been examined -- or are even available. In 1984, for example, top BEA official Robert Parker noted that for sales of all consumer goods, other than autos and trucks, only data from the first two months of the quarter were available when advance estimates of national income were being made.<sup>4</sup>  To estimate the GDP growth in such a case, with data either missing or unexamined, BEA economists must rely on a combination of extrapolation and guesswork. But given the turbulent nature of quarterly GDP changes, this guesswork often is very inaccurate. These factors mean that large revisions need to be made as the complete dataset becomes available and is examined in full by the BEA.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The revisions also tend to be large because the GDP growth rate is a rate of change. Thus, errors of a small magnitude in total GDP can lead to large errors in the growth rate. For example, if the actual GDP growth rate is 2 percent, even a small error in total GDP could translate into a large error in the actual growth rate, perhaps even 50 percent. In this context, it is not surprising that advance GDP growth estimates often vary substantially from the real figures.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Unfortunately, despite the fact that advance GDP growth estimates are subject to frequent and large revisions, they are quickly seized upon by politicians of both parties either to support their own records or to attack those of their opponents. And unlike the publication of advance estimates, revisions of these quarterly data by the BEA hardly make the news. This process of correcting and finalizing GDP estimates can last for months -- even years -- following that initial release and can result in huge revisions which tell a completely different story about how well the economy performed.<sup>5</sup>  <a href="fyi114c1.gif">Chart 1</a> shows the difference between the initial "advance" estimates of the real annualized growth rate of GDP and the most up-to-date revisions of these figures for the period since 1976.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<a href="fyi114c1.gif">Chart 1</a> shows the difference or "error" between the advance and the most up-to-date revised estimate of the GDP growth rate. The "magnitude of the initial error" refers to the amount by which the advance GDP growth rate was later revised. Thus, if the advance estimate was a 3 percent annualized growth rate and the revised rate was 2 percent, the absolute error was 1 percentage point, which represents a revision of 33 percent.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In most cases, the error is substantial; on a number of occasions, it exceeds the real growth rate itself. Among recent examples of large errors is the first quarter of 1992, when the BEA's advance estimate of GDP growth underestimated the real annualized growth rate by a factor of 135 percent (the advance annualized real growth estimate was 2.0 percent; real annualized growth in that quarter was actually 4.7 percent, according to the latest revision). The BEA also has revised downward its estimate of the growth rate for the first quarter of 1996 by a factor of almost one-third.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

An analysis of the revisions contained in the BEA's monthly <I>Survey of Current Business</I> over the 20-year period from 1976-1996 shows that these recent examples fit a general pattern over many years. In the 80 quarters between the first quarter of 1976 and the first quarter of 1996, the average magnitude of the total revision in annualized real GDP growth amounted to 1.4 percent of GDP. The average quarterly annualized growth rate in GDP over this period was 2.8 percent. This means that the average divergence of the advance estimate of GDP growth from the actual revised figure was equivalent to 50 percent of the value of the actual revised growth rate. According to BEA economist Allan Young, "advance" GDP growth figures failed even to show correctly whether GDP growth was negative or positive in 12 percent of all quarters over the period 1978-1991.<sup>6</sup>  Taking the Reagan years as an example, the BEA's advance figures underestimated the growth rate in roughly two-thirds (63 percent) of all quarters. Likewise, during the Clinton era, the BEA so far has overestimated the rate of growth in about 70 percent of all of its advance estimates.
<p>

<b>WHY IT MAKES MORE SENSE TO LOOK AT TRENDS IN GDP</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Because of the poor accuracy of advance estimates of GDP and the extreme volatility of quarterly GDP growth rates, a far better picture of the economy emerges from looking at the underlying trends. <a href="fyi114c2.gif">Chart 2</a> shows the trend<sup>7</sup> in economic growth compared with the <I>revised</I> quarterly GDP growth rates between the first quarter of 1976 and the second quarter of 1996.<sup>8</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The data in <a href="fyi114c2.gif">Chart 2</a> show two major patterns in the rate of economic growth in recent years: an acceleration in growth rates between the first quarter of 1992 and the final quarter of 1994 and a deceleration in the growth rate beginning after the peak in 1994 and continuing through to the current period. Both the expansion and the slowdown in the economy, however, have been punctuated by misleading "spikes," or individual quarters when the GDP growth rate diverged from the trend. For example, during the first quarter of 1993, in the middle of an expansion, the growth rate of GDP fell to zero. More recently, the economy showed strong above-trend growth in the third quarter of 1995.<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

As can be seen from <a href="fyi114c2.gif">Chart 2</a>, individual quarterly GDP numbers are a rough and often misleading signal of the long-term and medium-term strength of the economy. Quarterly GDP figures can fluctuate widely because of factors that are unique to that quarter and which pose no long-term implications for economic prosperity.
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Americans should not be lulled into a false sense of either economic prosperity or impending economic decline by estimates of the economy's performance during a single quarter. The advance estimates that are scheduled to be released on August 1 are likely to be revised considerably in the weeks and months to come. And even if these quarterly snapshots actually were accurate, quarterly GDP numbers fluctuate considerably for reasons unconnected with the long-term economic growth rate. Americans should not allow themselves to be deceived by these numbers and the political posturing surrounding them; rather, they should pay attention to the longer term patterns in the economy.

This moving average has the effect of filtering out large fluctuations in individual quarters while capturing the long-term pattern of change. For example, a once-off upwards fluctuation in growth in one particular quarter will change this moving average by a factor of only one-eighth of the change in the point estimate, but sustained growth over a number of periods will have a larger effect on the moving average.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Conservatives too often approach environmental issues without a clear framework within which to explain to the public how the objectives of environmental protection and economic growth can both be achieved. This failure has allowed many conservatives to be characterized falsely as "anti-environmental."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There is little understanding among Americans either of the need to reform environmental laws to maintain -- or improve -- protection for health, safety, and the environment, or of the fact that this can be done while simultaneously making them less burdensome to the economy. Until conservatives can explain more clearly why protecting the environment is not synonymous with adopting the "environmentalist agenda," they will be unable to build public support for badly needed reforms.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Although current environmental laws have not worked well, conservatives have not developed a cohesive vision to help Americans understand how these laws should be reformed. Moreover, when criticized by liberals, they have failed to challenge liberals to respond with proposals to reform these programs. It is important to show that the good intentions of current law often are accompanied by oppressive, senseless regulations. But it is imperative that conservatives also show why their policies would do a better job of protecting the environment.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Specifically, conservatives should stress the following themes:
<P>
<b>THEME #1: The Failure of Liberal Policies.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Conservatives need to explain that existing statutes have had many severe side effects. Among them:
<ul>
<li><b> Exorbitant costs with little return.</b> Conservatives need to explain that while costs have continued to skyrocket, the benefits being purchased have plummeted. Indeed, many of these increasingly expensive regulations now do more environmental harm than good.
<p>
<li><b>Property confiscation and loss of economic freedom.</b> Conservatives need to explain that private property is being taken from Americans through unfair regulation, and that many government "solutions" to environmental problems conflict with basic property rights.
<p>
<li><b>Lost opportunities cost lives.</b> Conservatives need to explain that the policies of the environmental agenda save few lives while squandering scarce economic resources that could be used to save more lives if dedicated to more serious risks. In effect, today's badly designed policies can kill.
</ul><p>
<b>THEME #2: A Positive Vision.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Conservatives need to articulate more clearly a positive approach to the environment that emphasizes:
<p><ul>
<li><b>An ethic of conservation.</b> Conservatives need to explain that the need to conserve  natural resources-- or use them efficiently --  is not in dispute. The debate is over how best to do that -- through markets or through government controls. For instance, a market-based approach would greatly reduce air pollution, and at far less cost.
<p>
<li><b>Property-based solutions.</b> Conservatives need to explain that the best way to achieve many environmental objectives is to create incentives associated with property ownership, not to issue thousands of pages of rules. For instance, property rights can be used to protect threatened species more effectively.
<p>
<li><b>Priority setting saves lives.</b> Conservatives must explain that not all things are equally important or urgent, and that regulating all risks equally means fewer lives saved for the dollars spent than would be the case if priorities were set. Conservative policies can save more lives. For instance, reforming Superfund would save more lives by focusing efforts on eliminating the highest risks more quickly.
<p>
<li><b>States do a better job than the federal government.</b> Conservatives need to explain that states are in a better position to deal with environmental matters within their borders than is the federal government. For instance, with the safety of drinking water supplies determined by states, the states would likely no longer squander resources obeying federal mandates that, until the Safe Drinking Water Act was recently reformed, required them to test for chemicals not even found in unsafe levels. Instead, they might focus on the far more mundane but persistent, serious, and largely ignored problem of bacterial contamination.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Conservatives have erred in putting too much political stock in the significance of horror stories -- absurd or onerous cases of environmental regulation. Public dismay at these stories does not signify broad-based support for deregulation. Americans understandably fear that if the "regulatory safety net" were dismantled, the country would return to the days of smokestacks billowing black smoke and burning rivers.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
That is why the message of balancing environmental protection and a strong economy has fallen on deaf ears. The public is easily convinced that the argument for deregulation is just shorthand for rolling back environmental protections. And many conservatives fan this fear by adopting decidedly anti-environment rhetoric. For conservatives to be successful in convincing the public to support more reasonable environmental policies, they must explain them far more clearly.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

A track record must be developed by which the public's hopes are met and their fears quelled. Most people want more freedom, a stronger economy, and a cleaner environment. The challenge is to show Americans how to obtain more of each.
<p>
<b>CRAFTING A SUBSTANTIVE MESSAGE</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Most Americans want both a strong economy and a clean, healthy environment. The problem is that environmental regulations can be enormously expensive, and can cost jobs and stifle economic opportunity. On the other hand, without environmental protections, robust economic activity, particularly manufacturing, often led to a deteriorating and unhealthy environment.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A generation ago, as people perceived that their quality of life was beginning to deteriorate, they began to support aggressive policies to reduce pollution levels. These policies frequently failed in their aims and became increasingly and unnecessarily expensive, but the environment did begin to improve. Today, many Americans are becoming aware that many of these policies are unreasonable and that, even when they work, they seem to bring only small improvements in the environment at a heavy cost in jobs and freedom. Moreover, many Americans are beginning to recognize that there often is no sound scientific basis for assertions of environmental harm or risk to the public. As families and businesses have begun to feel the economic effects and loss of liberty caused by these policies, the pendulum has begun to swing the other way.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Like most other people, conservatives have no wish to return to the days of black smoke billowing out of smokestacks.<sup>1</sup>  But they do want common sense brought to bear in dealing with the environment; they want reasonable environmental protection without having to sacrifice their freedom. At the same time, however, Americans generally want to be assured that reform will not lead to environmental deterioration. In other words, they trust conservatives to create jobs but question their environmental track record. If conservatives want to win the environmental debate, therefore, they must build that record and convince Americans that they hold the same values.
<p>
<b>HOW LIBERAL POLICIES FAIL</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While pollution levels have dropped dramatically since 1970, most of these reductions were achieved early in that period and at relatively low cost. From 1970 to 1990, total emission levels fell by about 34 percent. Over the same period, lead levels in the air fell 97 percent, and carbon monoxide levels in the air fell 41 percent.<sup>2</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As late as 1986, the annual cost of environmental protection was an estimated $87 billion. Since then, it has doubled to $174 billion.<sup>3</sup>  Meanwhile, environmental gains, which initially were very great, have slowed to a trickle as the federal government has run out of easy fixes and then attempted to eke out minuscule improvements in the environment at huge extra costs. These costs now represent about 3 percent of America's gross domestic product (GDP), or almost $1,800 per household per year.<sup>4</sup>

<TR><TD bgcolor=#eeeeff> Larry Mason's family sawmill employed 40 workers in Beaver, Washington. Says Mason, "in 1990, the spotted owl injunctions closed our mill, made my equipment worthless, and my expertise obsolete."<sup>1</sup>
<p>Bill Stamp's family in Exeter, Rhode Island, has been blocked from farming or developing its 70 acres of land for 11 years, yet has been assessed taxes at rates determined by the land's industrial value. As a result, this fifth-generation farm family may lose their farm.
<p>Environmental regulations to "protect" people can cause death. The best example is the set of Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards, intended to conserve energy and keep oil prices down. The only way auto makers can meet the CAFE standards is by building lighter autos. Unfortunately for drivers and passengers, lighter autos are less able to withstand the impact of crashes. This substantially raises the number of highway deaths; the expected number for 1989 model year cars alone is 2,500.

Environmental regulations also have caused immense hardships for businesses and small property owners alike. In the name of protecting the environment, powerless individuals have been forgotten as their businesses flounder because of expensive "command and control" regulations that tell them what to do and how to do it. The cost to individuals often is not a factor in the design of rules. Likewise, and without compensation, property owners often are required to forfeit the right to use their land for its intended purpose because regulators want to use it for wetland preservation or endangered species habitat. This can ruin them financially.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Ironically, despite the skyrocketing costs and increasing hardship for ordinary Americans, the current system does not guarantee that the environment will continue to improve, or that Americans' lives will become any safer and their quality of life any better. In fact, there is much evidence to suggest the opposite. For instance, instead of working to protect species, the current implementation of the Endangered Species Act has become the main impediment to recovery of species.
<p>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Why is this?  Consider that not a single species has recovered as a direct result of the Act.<sup>5</sup>  The few taken off the list so far were recovered for unrelated reasons (for example, the Bald Eagle, which benefited from a separate law protecting it) or because they were listed improperly in the first place even though always numerous (for example, the tumamoc globe berry). But when a listed species is discovered on a person's property,  the government  may restrict the landowner's right to use his property productively in order to preserve the habitat. The result: Landowners threatened with losing their livelihoods and property have little incentive to help maintain habitat. Indeed, the opposite is true. They are encouraged to eliminate habitat, perhaps through clear cutting, before restrictions are imposed in order to escape the devastating financial consequences. Thus, instead of encouraging landowners to protect endangered species, the Act often encourages them to destroy them.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In addition, some environmental regulations may be an indirect cause of deaths among Americans. A seminal Harvard University study found that 60,000 lives are lost unnecessarily each year because of the current regulatory regime. Dr. Tammy Tengs, now at the University of California at Irvine and the author of the study, summarizes this phenomenon: "[W]hen we spend resources on interventions that save lives at a high cost, we forego the opportunity to spend those same resources on interventions that save lives at low cost.... At our current level of resource consumption, we could double the survival benefits of our expenditures. Alternatively, we could retain our present level of risk reduction and, in addition, save billions of dollars."<sup>6</sup>

Viewing the problem from a different perspective, the regulations themselves can be fatal. Statistical analyses have shown that for every $7.5 million in costs the government imposes on the economy, overall worker living standards are lowered enough to cause one additional statistical death.<sup>7</sup>  When this formula is used to compare the number of lives "saved" by a particular environmental regulation with the number of lives lost through lower living standards, it turns out that many regulations actually increase the death toll.
<p>
<b>HELPING THE ENVIRONMENT THROUGH COMMONSENSE SOLUTIONS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

It is important for conservatives to approach the issue in a commonsense way that people can understand. Given the general skepticism, they must stress that the environment is something they want to maintain and improve -- and show that they mean it, not just with environment-friendly rhetoric, but with substantive policies that benefit the environment. Only by building a positive environmental agenda and track record can conservatives show that their reforms would create jobs and economic growth while also helping the environment. People need to be told that, while environmental protection need not come at the expense of jobs, it will cost jobs unless the model of centralized control of environmental protection is rejected. A better approach would be based on:
<p><ul>
<li> A conservation ethic (freedom with responsibility);
<p>
<li> Property rights;
<p>
<li>Priority setting; and
<p>
<li> A strong state role.
</ul>
<p>
<b>The Need for a Sensible Conservation Ethic</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Conservatives traditionally have stressed economic growth while ignoring the importance of environmental problems. Thus, they have fought environmentalists step by step -- and have lost step by step. The reason is not complicated: Environmentalists have occupied the moral high ground, even though they typically have not provided the most beneficial solutions. In short, conservatives have been on the wrong side of an emotional issue.<sup>8</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There are two lessons to bear in mind:
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>First,</b> what leftists and the public at large understand is that publicly owned goods free of constraints on use will be depleted over time.<sup>9</sup>  Garrett Hardin, Professor Emeritus of Human Ecology at the University of California, in his seminal 1968 work <i>The Tragedy of the Commons</i> showed that when a good is publicly owned (or "owned" in common), no one has an incentive to conserve or manage it. In fact, there is a perverse incentive to use the good inefficiently (to deplete it) as each user tries to reap the benefits for himself. This fact is at the heart of most environmental problems such as air and water pollution and species extinction.
<TABLE  align=left width=50% border=1 cellpadding=15 hspace=15 vspace=15>
<TR><TD bgcolor=#eeeeff>
Ten percent of the cars and trucks on the road cause over half of the pollution emitted by autos  and 20 percent of the autos cause more than 88 percent of the pollution. Yet the liberal approach has been to tighten standards for newer, cleaner cars rather than to attack the heart of the problem  -- older cars and untuned cars, and especially older untuned cars, which pollute heavily. Rather than making more regulations that add hundreds of dollars to the cost of millions of new automobiles to reduce their already low pollutant emissions by a few percent -- and aggregate auto pollution levels by even less -- it makes more sense to cut pollution levels by making the real culprits shoulder their share of the burden. Requiring heavily polluting cars to pay locally set fees or penalties based on the levels of pollution they emit as measured by remote sensing (similar in concept to a radar gun) could reduce car pollution levels dramatically, and at a fraction of today's onerous and illogical regulatory approach. Indeed, a pilot program by the state of Utah showed car pollution could be cut dramatically and cheaply simply by giving free tune-ups to the worst polluters. Moreover, by driving up the cost of new cars, regulations cause older polluting cars that are less expensive to be kept on the road longer, which works against the goal of lowering pollution.

</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Second,</b> if there are incentives to conserve resources, people will conserve out of self-interest. Thus, giving people a vested interest in providing environmental benefits (for example, through property ownership and other positive incentives) encourages them to provide such benefits voluntarily.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
When it comes to certain resources like the air and water, conservatives have tended to ignore the first lesson, and consequently have lost the opportunity to implement the second.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

"Freedom with responsibility for one's actions" should be the conservative message. Responsibility restrains wasteful behavior. The old environmentalist slogan "Make the polluter pay" actually is consistent with this message. But when they say this, conservatives and liberals mean different things. As Al Cobb, then Director of Environment and Energy at the National Policy Forum, says, "What the environmental lobby means by that phrase is that corporate polluters should be punished severely for any pollution whatsoever. What conservatives mean, however, is that polluters should bear the full cost of environmental degradation, but no more."<sup>10</sup>  Put another way, individuals and corporations should be given the incentive of reaping rewards for conservation and environmentally sound practices.
<p>
<b>HOW PROPERTY RIGHTS ENCOURAGE CONSERVATION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The free market actually encompasses the conservation ethic better than command-and-control regulation from Washington. A free market can occur, however, only if private citizens can engage in trade, and people can trade only what they own: some form of property. Thus, property is the cornerstone of a free market. If property rights are insecure or publicly owned, a market cannot function effectively. Some critics call this "market failure," but it really is a failure to use markets and their main engine: property rights. As a result, both environmental protection and personal liberty suffer. Resources that are not owned will be depleted or will deteriorate because neither protection of nor damage to those resources is part of the decision-making process. Others nevertheless are subjected involuntarily to the consequences of those decisions.
<TABLE  align=right width=50% border=1 cellpadding=15 hspace=15 vspace=15>
<TR><TD bgcolor=#eeeeff>
<ul>
<li>In the decade 1979 -- 1989, East and Central African elephant herd populations dropped from more than 1 million to less than half that. Yet in Zimbabwe, elephant herds have increased dramatically. The difference is that in Zimbabwe, hunting is permitted as a property right. Small villages that own the land on which elephants live and graze charge safari operators to conduct hunts. Since the villages profit directly, they have an incentive to promote herd growth to increase their income. In surrounding African countries, government bureaucrats seem unable to curb incessant poaching. But in Zimbabwe, villagers are constantly on the lookout for poachers because they cost the village income. Zimbabwe and a few other countries reward the conservation of elephants by allowing the conservationists themselves to profit from their protective behavior. In each country where this approach is practiced, elephant herd sizes are increasing.
<p><li>In Scotland and England, the popularity of fishing has burgeoned in recent decades. In these countries, property rights to fishing sites have developed which formed the building block for markets to provide access to prime fishing spots. As a result, many private, voluntary associations have formed to purchase fishing rights access.<sup>1</sup> In Scotland, "virtually every inch of every major river and most minor ones is privately owned or leased . . . . "<sup>2</sup> Owners of fishing rights on various stretches of the rivers charge others for the right to fish. These rivers are not overfished because it is not in the owner's best interest to allow the fish population to be depleted. The owner wants to continue charging fishermen for the foreseeable future, so he conserves his fish stock, allowing them to reproduce, and prevents pollution from entering his stretch of the river. If a municipality pollutes the water upstream, the owner of the fishing rights can stop it by suing for an injunction. Everyone wins, including fisherman desirous of quality fishing with some privacy.
<p><li>
One group's approach to wetland protection has shown the power of property rights to achieve environmental goals. Ducks Unlimited (DU), a group consisting of hunters and non-hunters alike, is dedicated to enhancing populations of ducks. To do this, it has purchased property or conservation easements with privately raised funds. Unlike other groups that started as hunting/outdoorsmen organizations but have largely lost their original focus, Ducks Unlimited has kept its focus on the protection of duck habitat.3 In the last 58 years, it has raised and invested $750 million to conserve 17 million acres of habitat in Canada alone, which benefits other wildlife as well as ducks. In 1994, it restored or created about 50,000 acres of wetlands. Since DU pays market prices for the habitat it protects, this group in many ways embodies the essence of the conservative message, which is to allow the market to determine the best and highest use of a good or resource -- in this case, duck habitat.

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Conservatives should concentrate on explaining the innovative ways property rights can be used to protect the environment. The most efficient method -- and the one that best protects individual rights and freedoms -- is to enlist self-interest in the service of environmental protection.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Unfortunately, property rights are under attack in the U.S. from the environmental lobby. The Fifth Amendment to the Constitution states, "nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation," but this has been interpreted to give absolute protection only against physical takings or complete devaluation of property. Most property-rights infringements, however, involve federal bureaucratic decrees that owners may not use their property as they see fit (for example, by continuing to farm it). Since the courts have been unclear as to the degree of protection these property owners should have from such intrusions, legislative protection is needed.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Protecting and using property rights, either in a stand-alone Act or as part of Endangered Species Act reform, would work to protect species in America. The Act does not work. Indeed, as many species are delisted because they become extinct as are recovered. The Fish and Wildlife Service now virtually ensures that threatened plants and animals will suffer because of the disincentives thrust upon landowners who understand that the value of their land and their economic security will be wiped out when federal agents tell them they no longer can make use of their property. Merely taking away this fear by promising compensation would be a large step in ensuring peaceful coexistence between species and owners of the property on which the species live. Moreover, property rights automatically will work to help species whenever there is an economic incentive to do so, such as protecting valuable fishing streams. But property also can be put to work to benefit species. If property owners were given financial rewards whenever threatened species bred on their lands, the species would not be threatened for long. It is no accident that cows, pigs, and chickens are plentiful in this country; people have an incentive to breed them. It is time this lesson was applied to other species.
<p>
<b>WHY PRIORITY SETTING IS IMPORTANT</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Ask the average American how much a human life is worth, and you probably will be told that "no amount is too much."  This is the answer that Congress and federal agencies use to justify imposing sometimes staggering costs on businesses to reduce the risk of death by infinitesimal amounts. While this allows policymakers to posture as saviors of life, these policymakers also generally fail to understand that wasting resources in this way means not using them in other ways that could produce better results and save more lives.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The economy has a limited ability to absorb environmental regulations. Simply put, the country cannot afford to eliminate every risk. There is an inherent trade-off: Attempting to regulate one risk out of existence may mean having to tolerate others. Thus, it is critical that regulators recognize the opportunity costs of their actions. Spending enormous amounts of money to eradicate small or even hypothetical risks means not being able to use those dollars in productive ways -- publicly or privately -- that would benefit the nation more.


<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It makes no sense to impose burdensome costs on consumers by, for example, regulating chemicals that are much less dangerous than everyday risks which average Americans, understanding that the danger is minimal, willingly accept. Yet that is exactly what the government does. For instance, the government routinely bans or regulates chemicals -- sometimes at the cost of billions of dollars -- whenever they pose a one-in-a-million chance of cancer, while simultaneously ignoring non-chemical risks hundreds of times greater that would be far less costly to regulate.
<p>
<TABLE  align=left width=50% border=1 cellpadding=15 hspace=15 vspace=15>
<TR><TD bgcolor=#eeeeff>
Priority setting will save lives and improve people's lives. The cleanup of old industrial wastes, embodied in Superfund, is a good example. The biggest problem with the law today is that cleanups are progressing at an incredibly slow pace, partly because money is being spent on lawyers to fight cleanups instead of on the cleanups themselves. Moreover, the law has stymied attempts to revitalize poor inner cities; few industries are willing to locate on sites there because of the risk of liability for cleaning up some former businesses' wastes. Also, it has been shown that fully one-third of sites pose no risk whatsoever to human health and safety unless residential housing is built -- and children eat the dirt. Thus, the standards often are inapplicable to inner-city industrial zones. The law should be reformed to speed cleanups by eliminating the barriers created by the current liability scheme, setting standards according to the real risks posed by the sites, and vigorously attacking wastes posing serious risks. Money should go to cleanup, not lawyers' pockets. This not only would protect poor people better and sooner, but also would allow inner cities to prosper again.</TD></TR></TABLE>
<p>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

If lawmakers were seriously to consider which environmental policies actually save the most lives, they would scrap many costly rules and use the freed-up resources in other ways that save more lives. This commonsense approach would lead to levels and types of regulation that are very different from those which burden America today. In many cases, if the private resources used to comply with federal mandates were to be left in the industries concerned, or used in other ways in the local economy, Americans actually would benefit more, and far more lives could be saved, as the following <a href="/heritage/library/categories/enviro/tp16c1.gif">chart</a> illustrates:
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This is why it is essential for policymakers to develop a priority list of environmental problems, based on the extent of the possible harm each appears to pose and the cost of reducing that harm to acceptable levels. Such a list would enable policymakers to know just how much risk protection is being bought for every dollar spent, and Americans to receive the maximum environmental "bang for the buck."  Conversely, the federal government could achieve environmental objectives at the lowest cost, and thus with the fewest "pink slips" for American workers.
<p>
<b>STATES ARE BEST EQUIPPED TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In thinking of the environment, conservatives should adopt the environmentalists' slogan: "Think globally, act locally."  There is no clearer statement of the need for greater local involvement in protecting the public safety and managing natural resources. While the federal government may serve a valuable role as technical advisor, especially to less populated or less sophisticated states, the states themselves are in the best position to know the needs of their citizens.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Localities form the front line in protecting public safety and should be given greater deference in prioritizing what public-sector actions will best protect the public. Communities then could redirect their attention to the most important problems, thereby protecting public safety and the environment more effectively.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Liberals like to argue that the states, if unsupervised, would ignore the health and welfare of their citizens. Nothing could be further from the truth. Experience has shown that those lawmakers and government officials closest to the people are the most responsive to the people. Conservatives should point out that federal regulators in Washington, D.C., because they are removed from the consequences of their decisions, respond more to national political pressures than to the needs and concerns of those who should count -- individuals and businesses facing the environmental and financial consequences of regulatory decisions.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Conservatives also must make it clear that in a time of budget constraints and the growing imperative to balance the budget, it simply makes no sense to spend federal money to combat exclusively local problems. States should begin to shoulder their share of the burden. Quite simply, there is no reason for taxpayers in California to pay for environmental problems in Montana, or vice versa. For instance, since hazardous waste sites by their nature are confined to very small areas, it makes sense for states to finance cleanups of "orphan" sites within their borders where no responsible party can be found.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Conservatives must begin to rethink environmental issues. They have lost the debate for decades because they have ignored the simple lesson that conservation is a conservative ethic. This ethic -- which at its core is simply freedom with responsibility -- is pursued by conservatives in economic policy and should be pursued in environmental policy as well. If conservatives are to win the debate on this issue, they must acknowledge that all Americans want an environment that is clean and healthy. It is something to which all Americans are entitled. But they are equally entitled to jobs and a high standard of living. In short, they are entitled to a higher overall quality of life. Environmental protection is not the enemy of economic freedom or of a strong and thriving economy. The issue is how best to realize as much of all three as possible.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Conservatives must tell the American people the truth about the failure of current environmental policy. There are numerous "horror stories" to illustrate how our policies are destroying lives and squandering scarce labor and natural resources on nonsensical or counterproductive mandates. But conservatives must be careful to articulate the positive message as well. Only this message will lead to both public trust and the needed mandate for change.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Conservatives also must explain how their policies can better protect the environment and lives. Whenever possible, they should explain that by refusing to prioritize risks when regulating, federal agencies systematically condemn thousands of Americans to death each year. In an era of limited fiscal resources, refusing either to get the "biggest environmental bang for the buck" or to save as many lives as possible for the money being spent is irresponsible and reckless.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The market is the best conservation tool available. By tapping into the powerful forces and positive incentives of the market and property ownership -- incentives that reward responsible behavior -- Americans can protect the environment more effectively while simultaneously increasing economic freedom and growth. Once the public understands that a conservative also can be an environmentalist, the debate will be won.

<h3> HOW TO TALK ABOUT PROPERTY RIGHTS:<br>
WHY PROTECTING PROPERTY RIGHTS BENEFITS ALL AMERICANS </h3>
By John Shanahan<br>
Policy Analyst
<p>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Talking Points No. 15<br>
June 19, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The federal government increasingly passes the costs of its policies on to private property owners. To protect species under the Endangered Species Act, to preserve wetlands under the Clean Water Act,<sup>1</sup> or to effect some other such goal, the government typically prohibits or constrains property owners from using their property as they wish-- for example, by forbidding them to build on their land. And when the government wants to build a new federal facility, the property owner can be forced to surrender title through eminent domain. To be sure, when the government wants to take privately held property for its own purposes, it has the power under the Constitution to force a sale of the property. But in these cases, it at least has to pay the owners just compensation for their property. The problem is that when government regulates how private owners may use their land, it typically does so without any recognition of, or compensation for, the costs.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This  <I>de facto</I> taking of property-- the practice of restricting a person's right to use his property without compensating him for losses caused by the restriction -- is now being questioned. Under this type of regulatory taking, property owners can face heavy financial burdens or even have their entire life savings wiped out.<sup>2</sup>  For example:<ul>

<p><li>John Sabanovich, an elderly man from Reading, California, saw his net worth plummet from $900,000 to $3,000 after being successfully sued in March 1996 for the purchase price of land he had sold: land that subsequently had been designated a wetland.<sup>3</sup>

<p><li>Bob and Mary McMackin of Arrowhead Lakes, Pennsylvania, built their retirement home and planted trees and shrubbery on dry land in 1989 after obtaining all necessary permits. But the couple were threatened by the Army Corps of Engineers four years later with $50,000 daily fines unless they quickly dug up their entire yard and created a wetland surrounding the house --just five feet away from the structure  --thus threatening the house's structural integrity. They were instructed to do this to restore the site to wetland status, and also to create another wetland off-site two times the size of the house to mitigate the lost wetland area on which the house sat. No one, including the government authorities who issued the various permits, had informed the McMackins that a wetland permit might be necessary for dry land.</ul>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite the belief of most Americans that seizing people's property by regulation without compensating them is inherently unfair and somehow un-American, few people -- including policymakers -- understand why protecting property rights is so essential.<sup>4</sup>  This is why Congress has yet to complete serious action to stop federal regulators from forcing individuals to surrender their property rights without compensation.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Numerous bills have been introduced in the 104th Congress to address this problem, but none has become law. In March 1995, the House passed H.R. 925, the Private Property Protection Act of 1995. Introduced by Representative Charles Canady (R-FL), and part of the Contract with America, the bill as passed would require compensation by the regulating federal agency whenever regulatory restriction of property rights under the Endangered Species Act and Section 404 of the Clean Water Act exceeds 20 percent of the value of the regulated parcel. It also would allow the owner the option of requiring the federal government to purchase the entire parcel whenever governmental restrictions cause more than a 50 percent reduction in the value of the land -- in short, when the government's interest in the property exceeds the owner's -- and would establish procedures for resolving disputes.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Senate has not acted on H.R. 925, but is considering the Omnibus Property Rights Act of 1995 (S. 605), also introduced in March 1995 by then-Senator Robert Dole (R-KS).<sup>5</sup>  S. 605 would require compensation by federal regulating agencies whenever the taking of some "portion" of property diminishes the value by 33 percent. The Senate bill also would establish voluntary alternative dispute resolution, would require a takings impact analysis, and would establish certain administrative rights for property owners under the Endangered Species Act and Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. Majority Leader Trent Lott's (R-MS) office has indicated plans to bring the bill to the floor for a vote this legislative session.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While lower percentage thresholds are preferable because more property owners will be provided relief, the difference in devaluation levels before compensation is required is not the most significant distinction between the House and Senate bills. More significant is that the Senate bill is more expansive in holding regulators accountable for their actions -- for example, by requiring that they assess the monetary impact to property owners of regulatory takings. Moreover, it uses a more expansive definition of property, including protection of contract rights, than the House version. The scope and focus of the Senate bill would be clarified if this definition were narrowed -- perhaps to real property, fixtures, and water rights.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite Senator Dole's departure, property rights legislation should not be shelved in the Senate this year. Property owners deserve protection from federal bureaucrats who increasingly resort to these regulations to take control of private property without regard to the burden imposed on American citizens and families.<sup>6</sup>
<p>

<b>THE IMPERATIVE OF PROPERTY PROTECTION</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There are important constitutional, economic, and fairness reasons for protecting private property rights. To understand why legislative protection is necessary, one must understand why property rights exist.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>The U.S. Constitution recognizes the importance of property rights.</b><sup>7</sup> The Fifth Amendment implicitly recognizes that the federal government may take property for public use. In fact, the implicit power of government to take property -- known as eminent domain -- was recognized by the Supreme Court as early as 1795 in <I>Vanhorne's Lessee v. Dorrance,</I> in which the Court found that "the despotic power, as it has been aptly called by some writers, of taking private property, when state necessity requires it, exists in every government.... [G]overnment could not subsist without it."<sup>8</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Fifth Amendment, however, explicitly mandates that government must pay the property owner for the land confiscated. Although the government may take private property for public use, the clause "nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation," ensures that the cost is borne by those who benefit -- the public -- and not by the citizen unfortunate enough to own the land the government requires. The Constitution does not balance the importance of such governmental action against the importance of compensating individuals. The right to compensation is absolute. Thus, balance is built into the system: The government is permitted to take property unilaterally for public use, but at the same time is required to pay for it and protect private owners from having to bear the financial burden of pursuing that new use. In its most basic sense, compensation is a fairness issue. Why should one American bear the entire burden of the government's pursuit of a national good?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Just compensation for regulatory takings preserves individual civil rights.</b> Having seen the detrimental effects of King George's policies, the founders understood that property rights are essential to preventing the usurpation of other rights under the Constitution. It is this relationship to which Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart was referring in <I>Lynch v. Household Finance Co. Inc.</I> when he stated that there is a "fundamental interdependence... between the personal right to liberty and the personal right to property."<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Practically speaking, governments can control a wide range of individual activity if they can control whether individuals remain financially secure or surrender their property. Thus, the majority truly can tyrannize a disfavored minority. As James Madison wrote in Federalist 10, "[pure] democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention; have ever been incompatible with personal security or the rights of property."  It was the desire to restrict just such tyranny over individuals that motivated the framers to put severe limits -- like the requirement of just compensation -- on the unchecked will of the majority.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Property protection reduces the incentive for the federal government to confiscate property.</b> If property is to be put to its best and most highly valued use, it must be owned by individuals who appreciate its fair market value. The nation's founders well understood the positive economic consequences of protecting owners' investments in their property.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
If government had a free hand to take property without payment, the incentive to confiscate property that conferred only a small public benefit would be overwhelming. In fact, that is exactly what has happened. The federal government now owns 30 percent of America's land, with even higher percentages in the West (for instance, 61 percent of Idaho), and is using regulatory takings with increasing frequency to enhance its effective control over even more extensive tracts. The rationale: The cost to the government of compensating owners of the land would be too high. The problem with this approach is that the potential for relatively small public benefits through regulatory takings can lead to ruinous costs to private owners, who must shoulder costs the government deems too steep for itself.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In reality, federal enforcement officials have found that they can use regulations to gain control of property while circumventing the just compensation requirements of the Constitution. Federal property rights legislation thus is needed to provide a standard that will force federal regulators to consider the costs and benefits of taking private property. When the government decides it is in the public interest to constrain the use of private property for the public good, compensating the property owner at least ensures that the cost of providing the public good is spread fairly across all taxpayers and not just a few unfortunate individuals.
<p>

<b>THE NEED FOR LEGISLATIVE PROTECTION</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Supreme Court has been clear in requiring federal, state, and local governments to pay just compensation whenever they take or occupy land or real estate.<sup>10</sup>  Essentially, the Court has held that, even if just a square foot of land is taken and less than one percent of the value is lost, a taking has occurred and just compensation is required.<sup>11</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Unfortunately, the Court's decisions regarding regulatory takings have been less clear and consistent, leaving executive branch agencies with wide latitude in decisions regarding the enforcement and interpretation of laws. Thus, the federal government can take property through regulations in most cases without payment. Legislative protection is therefore necessary, both as a philosophical and as a practical matter. Only then can property owners be secure in the knowledge their rights will be respected, and able to invest their savings accordingly.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Although the United States was founded on the principle that government should not be allowed unfettered power to impose its will on law-abiding citizens or seize their property, federal agencies have found a loophole that allows them to usurp property through regulation. These regulatory takings can strip any American of the right to use his land as he wishes. In some cases, they even can almost wipe out the value of that land -- and with it, the life savings of individual citizens.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In light of the ambiguous and limited nature of existing protections against uncompensated regulatory takings, compounded by the increasing tendency of bureaucrats to use this ill-considered and unwise approach, legislative action is necessary to ensure that private property rights are fully protected.

<blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	On January 20, 1993, Bill Clinton raised his right hand and took an oath before God and the American people that he would "preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States." Now, as the next presidential election approaches, the American people are entitled to know whether he has kept his vow. Specifically, they are entitled to know something about the records being compiled in office by the men and women to whom President Clinton has granted lifetime appointments on the Supreme Court and the lower federal courts. Are Bill Clinton's judges mostly effective defenders of the Constitution, or are they legal realists who feel free to rewrite the Constitution? Are they moderate New Democrats committed to enforcing the law, or are they left-wing "political hangers-on" with a radical and unpopular agenda for social change?	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To ask these questions is <i>not</i> to challenge judicial independence nor even the fundamental decency, on a personal level, of many of the Clinton judicial appointees. The decision that faces the American people is not whether Bill Clinton's judges should be impeached, or whether he should call on some of them to resign, or whether they should have been confirmed in the first place, or whether they are nice people or smart lawyers. The question is, "Given the president's record so far, can we expect a federal judiciary shaped by Bill Clinton to respect the Constitution and honor its role as the interpreter, and not the maker, of our laws?"<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	There are two major problems with Bill Clinton's judges. First, they have been unwilling to follow the Constitution in a number of very important cases. And, second, when they choose not to follow the Constitution, they have all too often replaced it with radical and unpopular left-wing social policy. In area after area, Bill Clinton's justices and judges are compiling a public "policy" record that is far to the left of the president's own public statements on similar issues. Bill Clinton may present himself to the public as a mainstream moderate, but his likable justices and judges are working quietly to impose a radical McGovernite legislative agenda on the country.
<p>

<font size="+2"><EM>Many Clinton judges have replaced the Constitution<br>
with radical and unpopular left-wing social policy</EM></font>
<hr width=75% size=3>
</center><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Bill Clinton's judicial appointments have had their biggest impact to date on the U.S. Supreme Court. With only two appointees, he has succeeded in transforming a moderately conservative Court into one that is (at best) one vote away from being an engine of radical left-wing social change. His justices are the political heirs of William J. Brennan and Thurgood Marshall, and they have gotten the better of the lightweight Republican justices imposed on Presidents Reagan and Bush by a Democratic Senate (and by liberal Republicans) after the 1987 nomination of Judge Robert H. Bork was viciously defeated. Many conservatives don't realize just how liberal Bill Clinton's two affable Ivy League justices really are. In part, this is because Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer are exceptionally bright and likable people. Nevertheless, in case after case they have voted for Big Government, against federalism, for a radical secular humanism that hates religion, against traditional social values, for the "rights" of pornographers and drug dealers, against private property, for racial quotas and preferences, and against the creation of a truly colorblind America.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The two Clinton justices depart from the William J. Brennan model of liberal judicial activism in only two significant ways: first, they write (or join) opinions that are more cagey and politically astute than blunderbuss opinions such as <i>Roe v. Wade</i>. As a result, the public is unaware of the extent to which radical left-wing policy ideas are seeping into our court opinions. Second, they do not oppose the death penalty across the board, although to some extent they resist its implementation. In every other important respect, the two Clinton justices are the children of the Warren Court, far-left ACLU judicial activists intent on writing their own radical and elite prejudices into the Constitution.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Many of Bill Clinton's lower-court judges (though not all) are equally or even more left-wing, but they have been unable so far to have much of an impact, both because they remain outnumbered and because the Reagan-Bush judges on the lower courts have turned out better in most parts of the country than have their brethren on the Supreme Court. If Bill Clinton wins a second term, however, this will change. In less than four years, he has filled about 25 percent of the seats on the federal judiciary. If re-elected to another term, he will have a chance to replace hundreds more retiring judges, and many of the federal courts of appeals will flip from Reagan-Bush to Clinton-Carter majorities. And depending on how lucky he gets, he will almost certainly name another one to three left-wing Supreme Court justices. This means that the few 5 to 4 wins that conservatives have managed recently will all become losses.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Let's look at what Bill Clinton's America will then be like, and contrast it with the America he claims to want. A good way to do this is to compare the specific policies Bill Clinton says he favors with the left-wing social policies that his judges are legislating from the bench. In doing this, we should remember that not all the Reagan-Bush appointments have turned out well, nor have all of Bill Clinton's judges turned out badly. Nonetheless, the overall pattern is quite clear.<p><b>Limited Government</b><blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<i>	"The era of big government is over" (January 23, 1996).</i></blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Or so Bill Clinton said in his last State of the Union address. Unfortunately, Justices Ginsburg and Breyer certainly have not yet been let in on the secret. Both have voted in favor of every single claim of national governmental power yet to come before them. Only a year ago, in <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/93-1456.ZO.filt"><i>U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton</i></a>, both Clinton justices were members of a 5 to 4 majority on the Court that struck down state-imposed term limits on Members of the U.S. Congress. As a result, the term-limit laws of 22 states, 21 of which had been adopted by the voters directly in initiatives or referenda, were declared invalid. The Clinton Justice Department filed an unusual "friend of the Court" brief to encourage this result. The fact of the matter is that Bill Clinton's Supreme Court justices killed the term-limits movement: had <i>either</i> of the two Clinton justices joined Justice Clarence Thomas's elegant and brilliant dissent, we would have term limits in most of the United States today.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	These votes were not anomalies. In <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/93-1260.ZO.filt"><i>United States v. Lopez</i></a>, both Clinton justices again voted for the position that the national government has unlimited power to regulate <i>all</i> aspects of the nation's economic, social, and cultural life. Justice Breyer wrote the main dissent for four of the nine justices and was joined by Justice Ginsburg. He paid only lip service to the idea that the U.S. Constitution limits the power of the national government in any way whatsoever. Under Justice Breyer's interpretation of the Commerce Clause, the federal government could nationalize education curricula, local law enforcement, family law, and everything else under the sun, so long as Congress could rationally think that doing so would in some attenuated way be connected to interstate commerce. Justices Breyer and Ginsburg clearly believe that the Big Government of the Great Society and the New Deal can do anything it wants to, so long as it does not violate the Bill of Rights or its "emanations and penumbras."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	This past March, Justices Ginsburg and Breyer were again on the wrong side of an important federalism case. In <i>Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida</i>, they joined a strident dissent written by Justice David Souter that argued for overturning a 200-year-old understanding that state governments are protected from lawsuits in federal court by the doctrine of sovereign immunity. Casting aside years of settled understanding, Justice Souter argued that Congress should be able to authorize citizens to sue state governments without their consent -- a theory that reduces the states from a position of co-sovereignty to one of abject subordination. Chief Justice William Rehnquist won the 5 to 4 vote in <i>Seminole Tribe</i> with no margin to spare, and the dissenters promised in their opinions to try to overrule the case at the first opportunity.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The Big Government activism of the Clinton justices also manifests itself in "separation of powers" cases since that doctrine, like the doctrine of federalism, is for them an inconvenient restraint on the unlimited power of the national government. Justice Ginsburg was one of only two dissenters in <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/93-1121.ZO.filt"><i>Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc.</i></a>, an important case that limited Congress's power to retroactively command the federal courts to reopen final judgments in private civil actions already decided. Justice Breyer weighed in with a tepid separate concurrence in the case rather than join Justice Antonin Scalia's forceful majority opinion.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The Clinton justices are completely unwilling to enforce the Framers' written Constitution of limited powers, federalism, and checks and balances. Their idea of constitutional law begins and largely ends with a judicially dictated jurisprudence of unenumerated rights. Even the constitutionally enumerated right that protects private property from being taken without just compensation is given short shrift: Justice Ginsburg, for example, joined three other justices in dissenting from Chief Justice Rehnquist's important opinion in <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/93-518.ZO.filt"><i>Dolan v. City of Tigard</i></a>, which protected private property from confiscation by regulation. In that case, a municipal government was ultimately rebuffed in its attempt to force a shop owner to set aside 15 percent of her land as a public easement as a condition of receiving a building permit. Justices Ginsburg and Breyer also dissented in <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/93-1823.ZO.filt"><i>Missouri v. Jenkins</i></a>, the Kansas City school-desegregation case. In that case, they joined an opinion that took the extraordinary position that federal judges can require local governments to raise taxes in order to fund remedial education and magnet schools.<p><b>Religious Freedoms</b><blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<i>	"[The First Amendment] does not convert our schools into religion-free zones. . . . I am deeply troubled that so many Americans feel that their faith is threatened. . . . When the First Amendment is invoked as an obstacle to private expression of religion, it is being misused. . . . Religion has a proper place in private and a proper place in public, because the public square belongs to all Americans" (July 12, 1995).</i></blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Or so said Bill Clinton in a widely reported speech at a suburban Washington, D.C.-area high school. It went unremarked at the time, however, that his two Supreme Court appointees had recently voted in <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/94-329.ZO.filt"><i>Rosenberger v. University of Virginia</i></a> to maintain our schools as religion-free zones. The issue in <i>Rosenberger</i> was whether a student activities fund, which was used to support various publications by student groups, could also be used to pay for the printing costs of <i>Wide Awake</i>, a Christian student newspaper. By a vote of 5 to 4, the Court said yes, over the dissenting votes of Justices Breyer and Ginsburg.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The opinion that they joined was a militantly secular tirade against any role for religion in any public institution. It reasoned that not a penny of public money can ever be spent on anything religious, even though public money is routinely spent in huge quantities on educational programs hostile to religion or to religiously inspired moral values. Under the ahistorical rhetoric of the dissenters in <i>Rosenberger</i>, it is hard to see how the courts could ever uphold government chaplains, Thanksgiving Day holidays, mottoes on our currency, school vouchers, or even tax deductions for religious organizations. The <i>Rosenberger</i> dissent theorizes that no government aid can ever go to any religious organization, even if the aid is equally available to comparable secular organizations.<blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<i>	"I personally did not believe that it was coercive to have a prayer at an outdoor sporting event or at a graduation event because I don't believe that it is coercive to people who don't participate in it" (November 14, 1994).</i></blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A nice sentiment, but one that is unfortunately not shared by Judges Theodore McKee and H. Lee Sarokin, Bill Clinton's two appointees to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. In fact, Judge McKee wrote the <i>en banc</i> opinion for the Third Circuit in <i>ACLU and Edward Ross v. Black Horse Pike Regional Board of Education</i>, a decision that banned student-led graduation prayers throughout Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware. Judge McKee's radical opinion went further than the U.S. Supreme Court has ever gone in this area by outlawing student-led graduation prayers as well as prayers organized directly by a school principal. In order to do this, Judge McKee had to reject a directly "on point" holding of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which had upheld student-led graduation prayers in <i>Jones v. Clear Creek Independent School District</i>. Four Reagan-Bush judges dissented from Judge McKee's opinion, while every Democratic appointee on the Third Circuit joined it. Judge McKee's pro-ACLU advocacy was so effective with his colleagues that he even brought a number of the feebler Reagan-Bush appointees along with him. Bill Clinton's hopes that we could have graduation prayer were dashed by his own appointee. Now, to determine what our national policy will be on this issue, an increasingly anti-religious Supreme Court will soon be obliged to hear and resolve the conflict that Judge McKee has created between the Third and Fifth Circuits on this issue.<p><b>Racial Quotas and Preferences</b><blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<i>"I say to you, I'm against quotas. I'm against discrimination" (September 21, 1995). "Today, I am directing all our agencies to comply with the Supreme Court's Adarand decision, and also to apply the four standards of fairness to all our affirmative-action programs that I have already articulated--no quotas in theory or practice; no illegal discrimination of any kind, including reverse discrimination; no preference for people who are not qualified for any job or opportunity; and as soon as a program has succeeded, it must be retired. Any program that doesn't meet these four principles must be eliminated or reformed to meet them" (July 19, 1995).</i></blockquote><p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Great rhetoric but, unfortunately, there are two Clinton appointees who will not be complying with the Supreme Court's 5 to 4 decision in <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/93-1841.ZO.filt"><i>Adarand</i></a> outlawing quotas in federal programs. Yes, that's right -- Justices Breyer and Ginsburg both dissented in that case, and Justice Ginsburg actually wrote one of the dissenting opinions. She tried to put a pro-racial-preference spin on Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's plurality opinion, and said she saw "today's opinion as one that allows our precedent to evolve, still to be informed by and responsive to changing conditions." Translated into everyday English, Justice Ginsburg hopes to distinguish or overrule <i>Adarand</i> at the first opportunity.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	And what, you may wonder, ws the "moderate" federal affirmative-action program in <i>Adarand</i> that Justices Ginsburg and Breyer were so eager to uphold? It was an explicit racial-preference program for government highway subcontractors, a preference so blatant that even many who support affirmative-action recruitment efforts in universities have condemned programs like this one. Justice Ginsburg was so enthusiastic about this particular program that she not only authored a dissenting opinion herself but also joined <i>two</i> other dissenting opinions: one by Justice Souter and another, even more radical, opinion by Justice John Paul Stevens. Justice Ginsburg was the only other member of the Court to join Justice Stevens's opinion, which would appear to uphold all federal racial-preference programs of any kind that are, in his opinion, well motivated.
<p>
<center>
<hr width=80% size=3>
<font size="+2"><EM>Justices Breyer and Ginsburg have voted to uphold every <br>racial preference or quota that has come before them</EM></font><hr width=80% size=3></center>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Justices Ginsburg and Breyer's votes on the racial preference/quota issue in <i>Adarand</i> were not at all idiosyncratic. Rather, they form part of a pattern in which both justices have voted to uphold every racial preference or quota that has ever come before them. In particular, they have dissented in every voting-rights case involving challenges to political redistricting, decisions in which race played the predominant role. This past year, they joined the minority in the 5 to 4 decisions in <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/94-923.ZO.filt"><i>Shaw v. Hunt</i></a> and <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/94-805.ZO.filt"><i>Bush v. Vera</i></a>, in which the Court threw out racially gerrymandered congressional districts in North Carolina and Texas. Last year, Justice Ginsburg wrote the dissent for four justices (including Justice Breyer) in the companion cases of <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/94-631.ZO.filt"><i>Miller v. Johnson</i></a> and <i>United States v. Hayes</i>, in which the Court invalidated racial gerrymanders in Louisiana and Georgia.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The issue in these cases is whether it is unconstitutional to create wildly odd-shaped legislative districts for the purpose of maximizing the proportion of voters of a particular race, when such districts violate traditional districting standards of compactness and affinity of community interests. The purpose of this whole enterprise is to use federal voting-rights law to allocate congressional seats by race, so that every racial and ethnic group in the nation is proportionately represented according to their numbers in the population at large. While greater minority representation in public life is to be desired, this particular quota regime is in fact a stealthy imposition of the system of proportional representation used in places like Israel, Japan, Russia, and Germany (under the Weimar Republic). Everyone familiar with the unstable politics of those countries knows that this kind of rigid proportional representation is disastrous for social peace, because it rewards extremists and penalizes consensus building. For this reason, many have long thought that the Anglo-American tradition of allocating electoral districts geographically is better than the Continental European tradition of proportional representation. <p>

<hr width=80% size=3></center>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The Ginsburg-Breyer view of racial gerrymandering would authorize nothing less than a racial quota system for Congress. By enshrining a system of racial and ethnic proportional representation, it would also codify a political system of racial spoils and push us toward the unstable electoral system that has been the bane of Continental European democracies. 

<p><b>Crime</b><blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <i>	"The United States cannot tolerate the rates of crime and violence which have come to be almost commonplace in the last several years. We have to intensify our efforts to reduce crime" (July 28, 1996).</i></blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Few issues are of greater concern to most Americans than the fight against violent street crime and illegal drugs, and, as is well-known, Bill Clinton loves to boast that his administration has been tough on crime and on punishing criminals. Once again, however, his judicial appointees often seem to be seriously "off message" when criminal-law cases are before the courts. In its most recent term, the Supreme Court decided <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/94-1511.ZO.filt"><i>Lewis v. Casey</i></a>, a major case bearing on the right of prisoners to enjoy free prison libraries and legal assistance. The case involved how broadly to read an activist opinion from the 1970s by the late Justice Thurgood Marshall, which requires state taxpayers to subsidize frivolous prison litigation by providing free legal help and library facilities. In this particular case, a federal court in Arizona issued sweeping orders to state prison officials to address the complaints of state prisoners about the quality of their legal research materials.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Justice Scalia, writing for five Reagan-Bush justices, seized on the case as a chance to cut back on Thurgood Marshall's requirement that state governments subsidize prisoner lawsuits. Scalia argued that the federal courts had no business trying to run state prisons, and he set some common-sense limits on the bad precedent by making it inapplicable when prisoners' claims were frivolous or when prisoners were trying to bring legal action irrelevant to sentences and terms of confinement. Justice Thomas, in a brilliant concurrence, even called on the Court to overrule its offensive and nonsensical precedent. Justices Ginsburg and Breyer, however, chose to dissent from most of Justice Scalia's opinion. They joined a handwringing, meandering dissent that complained that Scalia was going too far and too fast in protecting state prison authorities and taxpayers from the desire of prisoners for good libraries.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	This same term, Justices Ginsburg and Breyer also joined a sweeping opinion by Justice Stevens in <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/95-266.ZO.filt"><i>Jaffee v. Redmond</i></a> that recognized a disturbing new rule that could keep vital evidence of wrong behavior from being used in federal court for either civil or criminal trials. In that case, the Court held that conversations between a patient and her psychiatrist <i>or social worker</i> are protected from compelled disclosure during the course of a federal criminal or civil trial. The Court's decision to exclude a sweeping new category of evidence in this case is disturbingly reminiscent of the Warren Court's great exclusionary-rule blunders in the 1960s. Every time evidence is excluded from the courtroom, the task of proving the guilt (or innocence) of the culpable becomes more difficult. To impose this burden upon prosecutors in order to protect communications not only with psychiatrists but also with social workers is sheer folly. As Justice Scalia noted in his dissent, we don't allow a testimonial privilege in federal court for conversations with parents, siblings, children, or bartenders. Why on earth would we carve out such a privilege for social workers? Sadly, the case was lost by a vote of 7 to 2.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Justice Breyer cast two other noteworthy votes in criminal cases this term. First, he joined two separate opinions in <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/95-8836.ZO.filt"><i>Felker v. Turpin</i></a> that sought to water down the new federal law for expediting the application of the death penalty. Second, he joined the dissent in an important 5 to 4 decision on whether police can apply a property seizure law designed to discourage prostitution. Had the dissenters' view prevailed, the customers of prostitutes would have been able to protect their cars from confiscation by co-registering them with the very wives they were betraying.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	There are countless lower-court criminal-law opinions by Clinton appointees that are deeply disturbing. To mention just one example, consider <i>United States v. Hamrick</i>, decided by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, where Clinton appointee M. Blane Michael joined a dissent that would have exonerated a defendant who had mailed a bomb to the U.S. Attorney who had prosecuted him. Judge Michael was of the view that the bomb was not a "deadly weapon" within the meaning of the federal criminal law, because it was badly made and didn't cause too much damage when it exploded!<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	As these examples illustrate, this administration is appointing some disturbingly fuzzy minds to the federal bench. Once again Bill Clinton's tough talk on crime is revealed to be nothing more than talk. His judges are rapidly bringing us back to the bad old days of 1960s Warren Court liberalism.<p><b>Mainstream Values</b><blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<i>
	"When I sought the presidency, I said that I wanted . . . to put mainstream values back at the heart of social policy. . . . [W]e're moving in the right direction to reassert and reinsert into American life mainstream values. And, I believe the initiatives of our Administration have played a role in that" (October 13, 1995). "I know not everybody's going to be in a stable, traditional family like you see in one of those 1950s sitcoms, but we'd be better off if more people were" (September 9, 1994).</i></blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Mainstream values? Stable traditional families? So far, Bill Clinton's justices and judges have voted to: strike down his own liberalized policy on "gays in the military" as unconstitutional; require that gays be given special rights under certain state and local civil rights laws, thus forcing private landlords, elementary-school boards, and employers to associate with militant gays even if they don't want to; oppose an important Utah statute that regulates abortions <i>after 20 weeks</i>; and, incorporate a particularly strident and unreasonable version of the failed Equal Rights Amendment into the federal Constitution. And, they have managed to do all of this in just the last two years!<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Let's take these "mainstream values" judicial opinions one at a time. As is well known, Bill Clinton shot himself in the foot shortly after he was elected by attempting to change the U.S. military's long-standing policy of refusing to allow homosexuals to serve in the military. After an enormous public uproar, he was forced to back down by moderate liberals like Senator Sam Nunn and Colin Powell, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In November 1993, he signed a statute creating a new "don't ask, don't tell" compromise policy; it was designed to quell public outrage by keeping outspoken gay individuals out of the armed forces, while making clear that the military should not pursue the expulsion of gays who did not commit homosexual acts and who did not discuss their private sexual activities and inclinations.<p>
<p>
<center><hr width=90% size=3>
<font size="+2"><EM>A constitutional right for homosexuals to marry, adopt <br>children, or teach in grade school may be just around the corner</EM></font><hr width=90% size=3></center> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Since then two federal courts of appeal have heard cases on this issue. In <i>Stefan v. Perry</i>, the D.C. Circuit voted 6 to 4 that the long-standing pre-1993 policy of excluding homosexuals from the military did not violate the Constitution. Bill Clinton's sole appointee, Judge Judith Rogers, voted to invalidate the policy, as did all the Carter appointees. All of the Reagan-Bush appointees voted to uphold the policy. On April 5, 1996, the full U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit voted 9 to 4 to uphold the constitutionality of Bill Clinton's own "don't ask, don't tell" policy. Amazingly, <i>both</i> of Bill Clinton's appointees to that Court, Judges M. Blane Michael and Diana Motz, voted to strike down his own quite liberal policy as unconstitutional.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But Judges Rogers, Michael, and Motz are by no means out of step for the Clinton judiciary on these matters. Last May, Justices Ginsburg and Breyer joined a 6 to 3 majority in <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/94-1039.ZO.filt"><i>Romer v. Evans</i></a>. In that case, gay-rights groups had challenged a ballot initiative passed by Colorado voters that overrode all attempts by Colorado towns to enact special civil-rights protections for gays. Had the two Clinton justices joined the three dissenters in that case, Colorado's policy of legalizing homosexuality but not granting it preferential status would still be good law.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Some conservatives have been tempted to read the Court's confused opinion in <i>Romer</i>, which Justices Breyer and Ginsburg joined without comment, quite narrowly. This is almost certainly a mistake. The opinion contains opaque references to the illegality of "status discrimination" -- a key issue in the "don't ask, don't tell" cases heard so far by the D.C. Circuit and the Fourth Circuit. If the Court pursues this idea of outlawing "status discrimination," and if it continues to view any failure to treat homosexuals like heterosexuals as being evidence only of "irrational animus," then there is no reason to think that a constitutional right for homosexuals to marry, adopt children, and teach in grade schools is not right around the corner. The Court's meandering opinion and the silence of the five justices who joined it offer no assurance whatsoever that <i>any</i> differential treatment of homosexuality is still allowed. Those conservatives who took comfort in the Court's refusal to say it was applying "strict scrutiny" (the highest level of judicial scrutiny) to classifications based on sexual orientation are being misled. The Court is applying strict scrutiny in this case, without acknowledging candidly that it is doing so.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The "mainstream values" of the Clinton judges don't end with issues bearing on homosexuality. In <i>Leavitt v. Jane L.</i>, the Court voted 5 to 4 to summarily reverse a decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit that invalidated those portions of a Utah state law that prohibited abortions after 20 weeks, except where the mother's life or medical health will be seriously threatened or where the child will be born with "grave defects." The case arose because under <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/91-744.ZO.filt"><i>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey</i></a> (1992), the Utah statute was unconstitutional insofar as it prohibited abortions before the fetus is "viable" outside the womb.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The Utah law, however, clearly provided for the "severability" of its other provisions in the event that one part of the law was ruled unconstitutional. The Tenth Circuit had willfully refused to sever the statute so that abortions after 20 weeks could be regulated. Five Justices joined a rare, short <i>per curiam</i> opinion summarily reversing this as blatant error. This short opinion reflected nothing more than the long-settled idea that even after <i>Roe v. Wade</i>, the states can still regulate third-trimester, "post-viability" abortions so long as no "undue burden" is placed upon the mother's right to protect her own life or health. Justices Ginsburg and Breyer, however, dissented. They claimed variously that the Court should defer here to the Tenth Circuit, that summary reversal should be used rarely, and (implicitly) that the issue was not important enough to merit a grant of <i>certiorari</i> and a summary reversal. Do they intend in a Clinton second term to try to extend the near-total right to abortion in Roe to third-trimester abortions or to infanticide? Why would anyone with "mainstream values" join an angry four-justice dissent in an easy severability case like this?<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Then, of course, there is the Court's "mainstream" opinion by Justice Ginsburg in <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/94-1941.ZO.filt"><i>United States v. Virginia</i></a> where the Court held that the Virginia Military Institute, an all-male military academy funded by the state of Virginia, could not constitutionally exclude women. This case is remarkable less for its invalidation of the all-male program at VMI than for its writing into the Constitution a particularly extreme version of the Equal Rights Amendment -- which had failed to win popular support and passage through legitimate channels in the 1970s and early 1980s. 
<p><center>
<hr width=85% size=3><font size="+2"><em>Single-sex combat units, draft registration, football<br>
teams, and private schools may now be unconstitutional</em></font>
<hr width=85% size=3></center>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Justice Ginsburg wielded the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection clause to create a new standard of strict scrutiny for gender classifications, while using a milder label that minimizes the political fallout for liberals in the White House and in Congress. Henceforth, says Justice Ginsburg, gender classifications require "an exceedingly persuasive justification" and are subject to "skeptical scrutiny." They may not be used to do anything that <i>in the view of the justices</i> "creates or perpetuates the legal, social, or economic inferiority of women" nor may they rely on anything that <i>in the view of the justices</i> involves an "overbroad generalization about the different talents, capacities, or preferences of men and women." Thus if American society thinks that single-sex draft registration or combat rules are desirable, it is going to have to say something "exceedingly persuasive" to a "skeptical" Justice Ginsburg. If American society wants single-sex sports teams at its state schools, it must have something "exceedingly persuasive" to say to a "skeptical" Justice Ginsburg. If American society wants to offer charitable tax-exempt status to a private women's college or to a Roman Catholic Church priesthood, it is going to have to say something "exceedingly persuasive" to a "skeptical" Justice Ginsburg.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	As Chief Justice Rehnquist (in his concurrence) and Justice Scalia (in his dissent) both pointed out, this anti-democratic, elitist nonsense has nothing at all to do with the very important subject of the equal rights of women. Justice Ginsburg made no effort in her opinion to explain why she thought VMI was unconstitutional while single-sex combat units or football teams were O.K. That is because she is not interested in equal rights for women in the sense that most Americans would understand that term. What Justice Ginsburg wanted to do all along, and did do, in the VMI case was to lay the doctrinal groundwork for a final assault on <i>all</i> remaining classifications and social practices, both public and private, wherein any distinction between men and women is made according to gender. She does not identify a single gender classification or social practice, either public or private, that she is definitively willing to approve. The door is being flung open to a massive judicial assault on our sexist military services, football teams, private single-sex schools, and religious organizations.<p><b>The V-Chip</b><blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<i>
	"I call on Congress to pass the requirement for a V-chip in TV sets so that parents can screen out programs they believe are inappropriate for their children. When parents control what their children see, that is not censorship. That is enabling parents to assume more personal responsibility for their children's upbringing" (January 23, 1996)</i>.</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Bill Clinton likes to leave voters with the impression that he is concerned about inappropriate television programs aimed at children. Unfortunately, Justice Ginsburg did not agree in the Supreme Court's recent <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/95-124.ZO.filt"><i>Denver Cable</i></a> case. In that case, the law in question sought to modify the public-access policy governing local cable networks that required them to broadcast indecent programming without restrictions. Astonishingly, Justice Ginsburg was one of only two justices on the Court who voted to hold unconstitutional <i>every single restriction</i> before the court that was aimed at suppressing indecent programming available to children watching TV. Justice Breyer's more moderate opinion would uphold a restriction like the V-chip, but not a reasonable requirement that people who want to subscribe to indecent programming must do so by taking some affirmative step to sign up for it. Evidently Justice Breyer is more concerned about the privacy rights of adults who watch indecent programming than about the rights of children who may accidentally see such programming on cable TV.<p>

values and prerogatives of the American people</em></font>
<hr width=65% size=3></center>  

	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Justices Ginsburg and Breyer's extreme solicitude for the consumers of pornography is shared by both of Bill Clinton's two appointees to the D.C. Circuit. Judges Judith Rogers and David Tatel were on the dissenting side of a 7 to 4 <i>en banc</i> decision that upheld a federal law restricting the broadcast of indecent material to the hours of 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. All seven judges in the majority were Reagan-Bush appointees, while all four of the dissenters were appointed by Presidents Clinton or Carter. It is by no means clear to me that this law would survive review on the Supreme Court today, given Justices Ginsburg and Breyer's views on indecency, the First Amendment, and the rights of children.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
As I hope I have made clear, the U.S. Supreme Court is now dangerously adrift. The last two years have seen an increasingly large number of opinions that are contemptuous of the beliefs, values, and prerogatives of the American people as well as of the democratic process itself. The Clinton justices have almost always been on the wrong side of these cases, and in many instances they have joined minorities of four in support of propositions that are ludicrous and offensive. Although Justices Souter, Kennedy, and O'Connor deserve some of the blame, the other three Reagan-Bush justices have been stellar. Justices O'Connor and Kennedy have joined those three to produce some very important 5 to 4 victories in fighting off racial quotas, allowing religious speech, curbing Big Government, protecting private property, and fighting crime. If Bill Clinton is re-elected and replaces any of those five justices with another "moderate" like Justices Ginsburg and Breyer, then every single conservative victory of the last 28 years will be at great risk of being overturned. The Warren Court ended when Richard Nixon won the presidential election of 1968; the presidential election of 1996 will determine whether the era that Nixon inaugurated is now to be replaced by a new burst of radical left-wing judging.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But what are we to make of Bill Clinton's role in all of this? Is it remotely plausible to think that he doesn't realize how far to the left his own justices and judges are of his own public statements on issue after issue? No, it is not plausible. Bill Clinton is a former professor of constitutional law, a Rhodes Scholar, and a graduate of Yale Law School. He knows perfectly well the views of the justices and judges he is nominating.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Obviously, these are very difficult times for anyone who believes in a restrained, law-abiding federal judiciary. There is, however, one consoling thought. If Bill Clinton is re-elected, he will have a mandate from the American people to rein in Big Government, protect religious speech, oppose racial preferences, preserve mainstream values, fight indecent television programming aimed at children, and fight crime and drugs. Which jurist could Bill Clinton possibly name to the Supreme Court whom he could count on to do all of the things that he says he wants done? The answer is obvious: renominate Judge Robert H. Bork.<p>

F.Y.I. No. 103<br>
May 21, 1996<br>

Very soon, both the House of Representatives and the Senate will debate identical versions of the <a href="http://rs9.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d104:h.r.03144:">Defend America Act of 1996</a>. The Defend America Act commits the nation to deployment of a national missile defense system by 2003. It is similar to the provision in the FY 1996 defense authorization bill vetoed by President Bill Clinton on December 28, 1995. How Members of Congress vote on this bill will rest primarily on their understanding of the immediacy of the missile threat. Members who see the threat as present and growing will likely vote in favor of the bill; those who see the threat as remote are likely to vote against it.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In November 1995, the U.S. intelligence community issued an intelligence assessment describing the ballistic missile threat to the United States.<sup>1</sup>  Among other things, it concluded that there is little threat of a missile attack on the U.S. during the next 15 years. President Clinton and congressional opponents of the Defend America Act use this assessment to justify their opposition to deploying a national missile defense as soon as possible. Since this assessment is crucial to the coming debate on missile defense, and since the vote on this legislation may well determine the future of U.S. security against missile threats, the assessment deserves thorough analysis.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Normally, it is impossible for the public to pass judgment on the content of intelligence assessments because they are classified. In the case of the intelligence assessment on the missile threat, however, the same summary version that was provided to President Clinton has been published.<sup>2</sup>  Thus, the public has an opportunity to decide whether the assessment is credible.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
An evaluation of this intelligence assessment reveals that it is not credible. In fact, it contains a number of flaws. The authors of the assessment:
<P><ul>
<li><b>Inexplicably discount the threat posed today by long-range missiles in China and  Russia.</b> The intelligence community concluded that the U.S. will not face a missile threat for the next 15 years. But this inexplicably discounts the already existing threat posed by Russia and China. The assumption is that because these countries already have long-range missiles, nothing new will happen in the next 15 years to change the level of the threat. But things can change, and very quickly. This is particularly true regarding the emergence of hostile intent toward the U.S.
<p>
The immediacy of Chinese hostility was revealed earlier this year when Chinese officials were quoted as saying that China could take military action against Taiwan without the U.S. intervening because U.S. leaders "care more about Los Angeles than they do about Taiwan."<sup>3</sup>  This was nothing less than a thinly veiled threat to attack the U.S. with long-range nuclear missiles if it intervened on behalf of Taiwan.
<p>
Another potential nuclear threat is posed by Russia -- as Clinton's Pentagon already has admitted. In fact, the intelligence report's findings on Russia blatantly contradict a fundamental conclusion of the Clinton Administration's own 1994 Nuclear Posture Review, its official statement of nuclear arms policy. This statement recognizes the volatility of the U.S. relationship with Russia.<sup>4</sup>  It even includes an option for "hedging" against a reversal in U.S.-Russian relations by arguing that America may have to exceed limits imposed by arms control agreements with the Russians if Moscow again becomes hostile. Russia is a strategic wild card -- a fact which the authors of this intelligence report blithely ignore. In short, the report's "findings" are fundamentally at odds with the Clinton Administration's own nuclear policy.
<p>
<li><b>Write off Alaska and Hawaii as territory to defend against missile attack.</b> The finding that the U.S. will not face a missile threat for 15 years is based on examining the missile threat to "the contiguous 48 states and Canada."  Alaska and Hawaii are not considered. Why this is done becomes clear when it is revealed that North Korea is developing a missile, the <I>Taepo Dong</I> 2, that could reach Alaska and Hawaii. North Korea could deploy this missile in three to five years. It is truly remarkable that the Clinton Administration appears to believe that the people of Alaska and Hawaii are strategic second-class citizens who deserve less protection than New Yorkers or Californians. It is even more remarkable that the President appears to believe that Canadians deserve more protection than Alaskans and Hawaiians.
<p>
<li><b>Are overly optimistic about how long it will take rogue states to develop long-range missiles.</b> The intelligence estimate states: "We [of the intelligence community] are likely to detect any indigenous long-range missile program many years before deployment."  But the intelligence community has a poor track record in detecting illicit weapons programs. It failed, for example, to detect major portions of Iraq's nuclear weapons program. International inspections of Iraq's nuclear program following the Persian Gulf War revealed that it was far larger and far more advanced than the U.S. intelligence community had predicted before the inspections.<sup>5</sup>  Saddam Hussein was only months away from deploying an explosive nuclear bomb, not years away as the intelligence community had predicted.
<p>
<li><b>Unwisely downplay the potential impact of foreign assistance on the missile threat to America.</b> They conclude that foreign assistance is a "wild card" that could be used by developing countries to accelerate their missile programs. Chinese assistance, for example, reportedly helped Iraq extend the range of their Soviet Scud-B missiles.<sup>6</sup>  The post-Gulf War inspections in Iraq revealed that the Iraqi Atomic Energy Commission relied on a wide variety of foreign sources to accelerate its nuclear weapons program. The foreign sources include corporations in the U.S. and Germany. This is one reason why the U.S. was surprised by the scope and advanced state of the Iraqi program. United Nations inspector David Kay commented on October 17, 1991, that "there is no region of the world that you will find that did not contribute to [the Iraqi nuclear weapons] program."<sup>7</sup>
<P>
<li><b>Underestimate the impact of space launch vehicle development on missile proliferation.</b> The intelligence estimate states that "if a country were to purchase an SLV [space launch vehicle], converting it to an ICBM [intercontinental ballistic missile] would involve technological obstacles roughly as challenging as those involved in an indigenous ICBM program."  This statement is surprising since space launch vehicle and missile components are very similar. Of the eight essential components of a ballistic missile, all but one -- the warhead -- are found in somewhat modified forms in space launch vehicles.<sup>8</sup>  Thus, the transfer of space launch vehicle components is virtually certain to assist countries in developing missiles.
<p>
Downplaying the potential impact of widely available space launch vehicle technology on missile development programs reflects the intelligence community's historic tendency to underestimate the pace of technological advancement in foreign weapons programs. Fifty years ago, U.S. intelligence failed to predict Soviet acquisition of atomic bomb technology. The Soviet Union tested its first atomic weapon in August 1949, years earlier than was predicted. America was shocked for a second time in 1957 when the Soviet Union launched its <I>Sputnik</I> satellite. Predicting that a missile threat to America is 15 years away indicates the same sort of complacency that resulted in surprise at the Soviet atomic test in 1949 and <I>Sputnik</I> launch in 1957.
<p>
<lI><b>Are completely unrealistic about the potential sale of long-range missiles and space launch vehicles.</b> The intelligence assessment concludes: "We expect countries that currently have ICBMs will not sell them."  This finding is contradicted by historical experience. China sold intermediate-range missiles to Saudi Arabia in 1988 and Pakistan in 1993. Why the intelligence community is so certain that China would not sell long-range missiles is a complete mystery. Moreover, even the Clinton Administration recognizes that Russia will be marketing its ballistic missiles as space launch vehicles. On September 28, 1995, the Clinton Administration agreed to modify the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) to lift restrictions on converting missiles to space launch vehicles.<sup>9</sup>  It did this to satisfy the Russians, who want to sell modified SS-25 <I>Sickle</I> long-range ballistic missiles as space launch vehicles. In short, the Administration agreed to modify an existing arms control treaty precisely to permit the kind of proliferation which is dismissed so easily in the intelligence estimate, and which it supposedly opposes so vehemently in its declared anti-proliferation policy. Apparently the Russians are beginning to implement this policy. Press reports on a classified Pentagon study reveal that Russia is selling SS-18 <I>Satan</I> ICBM components to the Chinese as space launch vehicle technology.<sup>10</sup>
<p>
<li><b>Inexplicably dismiss the threat of accidental or unauthorized missile launches against the U.S.</b> The intelligence assessment states: "We conclude that the current threat to North America from unauthorized or accidental launch of Russian or Chinese strategic missiles remains remote and has not changed significantly from that of the past decade."  Yet Russia and China are undergoing great political turmoil. Any fracturing of either country's political leadership cannot help but cause a break in the chain of command governing nuclear weapons. This is precisely what happened when an attempted <I>coup d'etat</I> against Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev took place in 1991. Nobody knew who had control of the Soviet nuclear arsenal during that time. Such political crises occur frequently, with little or no warning. It is all but impossible to understand why the intelligence community is so confident that the threat of accidental or unauthorized missile launches is so remote.
</ul><p>
<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The intelligence assessment of the missile threat to the United States contains so many flaws, contradictions, and ambiguities that critics naturally wonder about its objectivity. There are deep suspicions in Congress and the expert community that political leaders in the Clinton Administration intervened in the intelligence process to get the answer they wanted. Indeed, the Clinton Administration made a decision in 1993 to cut the national missile defense budget by some 80 percent. The Administration may have felt pressured to justify this decision by encouraging an intelligence assessment that minimized the threat of a missile attack on the U.S. The U.S. General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, is trying to determine whether the Clinton Administration did in fact intervene. If it is found that the Administration "cooked" this assessment, then President Clinton's veto of the FY 1996 defense authorization bill will appear to be not merely an act of willful ignorance, but the <I>coup de grace</I> in a shameless plan of deception.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Whether the intelligence assessment is objective or not is now a matter for Congress to decide. However, for purposes of the debate on the Defend America Act, it is enough to know that the possibility exists that this assessment was "cooked," that it is fatally flawed, and that it is therefore a poor guide to policy.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congress should not rely on this assessment as an excuse for deferring the decision to deploy a national missile defense system. Further delay in deployment could result in a surprise missile attack against which the U.S. would have no defense, and which could cost many American lives. If this were to occur, Members of Congress would not be able to hide their responsibility. The time for Congress to live up to this responsibility is now, before it is too late.

<title>Russian Hardliners' Military Doctrine: In Their Own Words - Heritage</title>

<h3>RUSSIAN HARDLINERS' MILITARY DOCTRINE: IN THEIR OWN WORDS</h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/cohen.htm">Ariel Cohen, Ph.D.</a><br>
Senior Policy Analyst<br>

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Some Western leaders and policymakers are remarkably unconcerned about the prospects of a victory by Communist Party candidate Gennady Zyuganov in the Russian presidential elections on June 16. Thinking that a communist return to power in Russia will be no different than it was in Poland or Slovakia, these Westerners appear to believe that a communist victory in Russia will not disrupt the burgeoning "partnership" between Russia and the West.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
However, the report translated here paints a different picture. Written by hard-line members of a nationalist-communist coalition that supports Zyuganov for president but maintains close ties with such nationalists as Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the document contains advice for Russian military planners that is profoundly disturbing for the United States and the West. No amount of "mirror imaging" in the U.S. or Western democracies can obscure the meaning of Russian hardliners as rendered in their own words.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Among the report's main points:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Russia should be moving aggressively to adopt a nuclear deterrence posture for perceived non-nuclear threats. Strategic nuclear forces should be the highest priority.
<p>
<li>Russia should be able to fight at least one full-scale regional war, one smaller-scale conflict, and at least three "peacemaking" operations outside its borders.
<p>
<li>The U.S. and NATO remain Russia's enemies. Other foes include Turkey and countries of the former Soviet Union such as the Baltic States.
<p>
<li>Russia's armed forces should be drastically reorganized on the basis of smaller, highly mobile units.
<p>
<li>Russia should be prepared to undertake military operations to reconquer the New Independent States (NIS) of the former Soviet Union. These operations would include seizing command-and-control sites, "eliminating" the political-military leadership, and deporting "some categories" of the hostile population, presumably to the Russian hinterland.
</ul> <p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The authors of these positions are analysts who advise the president and the Russian General Staff on military and security matters. One author is Lieutenant General Valeriy Dementyev, who was once Deputy Chief of Armaments in the USSR Ministry of defense, and today is an analyst with the Institute for Defense Research (known by its Russian acronym INOBIS, <I>Institut oboronnykh issledovanii</I>) in the town of Kaliningrad near Moscow. The other author is Anton Surikov, a defense analyst formerly associated with the USA-Canada Institute and also an analyst at the Institute for Defense Research. The secretive INOBIS is financed by the Russian General Staff, military-industrial enterprises, and the Atomic Energy Ministry, and conducts classified research. It was founded by senior figures from the KGB and the Russian military-industrial complex. Also instrumental in its founding was Yuri Maslyukov, Zyuganov's chief economic policy maker and the former head of the USSR's Central Planning Authority (the all-powerful GosPlan). INOBIS reportedly enjoys an attentive audience at the Ministry of Defense.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
People like Surikov and Dementyev advise Communist Party leader Zyuganov, radical nationalist Zhirinovsky, and President Boris Yeltsin's Atomic Energy Minister, Viktor Mikhailov. Even if Zyuganov loses the presidential elections, the views expressed in this report will influence Russian military and security policy. Many in the Russian armed forces and security services support a more aggressive stance for Russia -- a viewpoint clearly expressed in this document.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Heritage Foundation thanks Harriet and Bill Scott, leading experts on the Soviet and Russian military, for their kind assistance in translating this report.

<center><h3>ARMY REFORM AND SECURITY:<br>
Conceptual Theses of the Strategy of Reforming The Armed Forces of the Russian Federation</h3>

by Valeriy Dementyev, Lieutenant General (Ret.) and Doctor of Technical Sciences, and Anton Surikov, Doctor of Technical Sciences
</center><P>

<b>Deterrence and Defense</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The defensive character of the policy of the Russian Federation (RF) in the military area and the absence in Russia of aggressive intentions was proclaimed in the <I>Basic Provisions of the Military Doctrine of the RF</I>, unveiled in 1993.<sup>1</sup>  This thesis, however, is in need of clarification in terms of the precise tasks that the Armed Forces face. Among them, first of all, three basic tasks should be singled out:
<P><ul>
<li>The Armed Forces must have the capability to deter effectively the threat of nuclear attack on Russia and on the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), which have signed the agreement on collective security. In this, the talk is exclusively about deterrence, because national military thought acknowledges the impossibility of victory in a global nuclear conflict on the strategic level.
<p>
<li>The Armed Forces should be aimed both at deterring a large-scale military attack on Russia and the CIS by foreign governments or a coalition thereof using conventional armaments, and deterring and repelling military aggression from the outside that has more limited goals. Deterrence of such threats can be nuclear.
<p>
<li>The Armed Forces must have the capability to conduct local wars and carry out peacemaking operations, primarily within the bounds of the former USSR, taking into account that the former Soviet Union is a zone of Russian vital interests and home to 25 million ethnic Russians. Currently, the Russian Federation is conducting two local wars on the territory of the former USSR -- in Chechnya and Tajikistan. Besides that, the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation are fulfilling peacemaking functions that are in fact deterring Georgia and Moldova from commencing aggression towards Abkhazia, South Ossetia, and Trans-Dniester.<sup>2</sup>  Taking into account the practices of 1990-1996, the demand must be put forward, in part, for the capability to wage local wars within the bounds of the former USSR. The Armed Forces should be able to take part simultaneously in at least one local war of high intensity, at least one "slow" local war, and at least three "frozen" local conflicts and peacemaking operations.
</ul><P>
<b>Russia's Enemies</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The thesis of the <I>Basic Provisions</I> is that Russia has no outside enemies. Experience has demonstrated the falseness of this thesis. Because of Russia's weak government and the progressive degradation of its military and economic potential, outside enemies are making themselves known in a bolder and more open fashion.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Currently, Russia's basic probable enemies remain the United States and the NATO countries. The United States has a vast nuclear missile potential which, if used, can destroy Russia as a state. It was created with the goal of nuclear blackmail of the USSR and was oriented mainly at carrying out a first nuclear strike. At present, in spite of ongoing reductions within the framework of START 1, orientation toward a first strike not only has not disappeared, but actually has been increased. This is due primarily to the policy of the [American] authorities, particularly the U.S. Congress, toward revision of the ABM Treaty of 1972 and creates the prerequisites for development and subsequent deployment of a strategic ABM system by the year 2003.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In contrast to the Warsaw Pact Treaty Organization, not only has NATO, led by the USA, not been dissolved, but the decision already has been made to enlarge it. NATO's infrastructure, despite the reduction of personnel and armaments taking place under the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty, is still oriented toward actions in an eastern direction. The preservation of its basic military infrastructure gives it an opportunity to build up its troops quickly should such a decision be made. Although, as of today, the potential of NATO conventional forces is not sufficient to conduct a large-scale offensive operation against the Russian Federation similar to Hitler's invasion of 1941, over time these forces can be augmented and advanced to the borders of the Russian Federation. In this light, the plans for NATO eastern expansion look clearly aggressive. Moreover, in Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary measures are now being taken to adapt the infrastructure, airport network, communications, etc., for NATO use. One Hungarian airport, without prior permission, has been turned into an American military base.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It should be noted that the experience of the U.S. and NATO in the Persian Gulf in 1991, and in the former Yugoslavia in 1995-1996, demonstrates that the [Western] bloc today has sufficient potential to carry out military operations with limited goals on the periphery of post-Soviet territory. In this scenario, the greatest danger is presented by aggression from three possible directions: first, because of Norway's recent decision to expand NATO military activity in the north of the country, from the north against the Russian Federation's Northern Fleet on the Kola peninsula; second, in connection with the discussion about creating a 60,000-strong Baltic Corps from German, Danish, and Polish detachments, from the northwest in the form of military intervention by NATO in case of a conflict between Russia and the Baltic countries; and third, in light of the calls being heard to grant the countries of the Caspian basin NATO security guarantees similar to those given to the countries of the Persian Gulf, from the south, where the key role is assigned to a member of NATO -- Turkey.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Turkey possesses an army of 600,000. Its navy is already bigger than the Russian Black Sea Fleet. Turkey has unilaterally altered the status of the Black Sea straits, threatening Russia's interests. It has voiced numerous military threats toward Russia's ally Armenia with regard to the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh. Turkey is attempting to attract into its sphere of influence the Turkish-speaking and Muslim regions of the former USSR. It has been proven that Turkish officials supported [President] Dudaev's illegal military detachments in Chechnya. They also assisted the "Gray Wolves" organization in Azerbaijan and a number of other nationalistic military detachments throughout the CIS.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Japan, which is an ally of the United States and has territorial claims against the Russian Federation, might also be considered a potential enemy of Russia. Today, Japan does not have sufficient military power to start an aggressive military operation against Russia in order to take the islands of the Southern Kurils by force, but it does have the necessary potential to expand its Armed Forces quickly.
<p>
<b>China and Iran Are Not Enemies</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Obviously, the fact that Russia and China are neighbors must not be ignored when planning the development of the Armed Forces. At the same time, the military policy of the Russian Federation should be formed with extreme caution with respect to China. The U.S., seeing China as a potential enemy, is interested in creating a military confrontation between Russia and China.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Similarly, the U.S. has a clear interest in the confrontation between the Russian Federation and Iran, another American enemy. The "Islamic threat" to the CIS is used as an argument to promote a similar confrontation. After a close examination of this problem, however, it becomes clear that the extremist movements in the CIS that operate under pseudo-Islamic slogans are relying as a rule not on Iran, but on pro-Western regimes in the Muslim world: Turkey, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In light of the above, it is not practical to view Iran and China as probable enemies of Russia, at least in the near future, because there are no objective causes for confrontation between the Russian Federation and those countries.
<p>
<b>Recreating the Empire</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Within the territory of post-Soviet Russia, the main enemies are the forces of aggressive nationalism that operate with support from outside and have armed forces of their own: armies, police, and other militarized detachments of the Baltic states; Dudayev's illegal armed forces; Tajik opposition illegal armed forces; and others. The main causes of conflict involving the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation within the territory of the former USSR are the following:
<ul><p>
<li>Ethnic discord and genocide of national minorities. Examples of such conflicts where Russian Federation (USSR) Armed Forces were used, directly or indirectly, would be Trans-Dniester in 1992, the Prigorodniy region in Northern Ossetia at the end of 1992, Southern Ossetia in 1991-1992, and Abkhazia in 1992-1993.
<p>
In the near future, ethnic conflicts probably will have two major causes. First, as a result of the events of 1991, Russians are a divided people. Therefore, their objective tendency to reunite will become stronger as time goes on. Second, in all former USSR countries, except for Belorussia and perhaps Ukraine, ethnic minorities are subjected to discrimination.<sup>3</sup>  This is most clearly evident in the Baltic countries where, with the encouragement of Western institutions, human rights violations based on ethnic origin are part of official policy. The Baltic countries seem to be the most potentially explosive in terms of the possibility of new areas of conflict that could involve the Russian Federation's Armed Forces.
<p>
<li>Attempts by nationalist forces to seize power by armed force or to hold power in some republic of the former USSR. Examples include Tajikistan in 1992-1996, Lithuania in January 1991, Georgia during the winter of 1991-1992 and at the end of 1993, and Azerbaijan in January 1990 and the summer of 1993.
<p>
<li>Territorial claims against the Russian Federation and illegal attempts to seize sea and inland water resources that belong to Russia. Up to now, direct Russian participation in such armed conflicts has been avoided. But it is not out of the question, particularly because of the Baku government's policy of annexing part of the Caspian Sea, an inland body of water the rights to which should be shared equally by all countries bordering the region. Another potential source of conflict is the part of the Baltic Sea area that belongs to Russia but is claimed by Lithuania. It also is known that the ethnocratic regimes of Tallin and Riga are claiming a part of the Russian Federation's Northwestern territory.
<p>
<li>The desire of certain forces in the former USSR, primarily in the Baltic countries, to become a part of the NATO alliance. In such cases, one cannot exclude preemptive use of force by the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation to stop decisively any practical steps that might be taken by armed nationalist detachments to implement their provocative plans.
</ul><p>
<b>Budget Priorities</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Obviously, in the near term, reform of the Russian Federation's Armed Forces will be conducted under conditions of deep economic crisis. Thus, the decisive factor in choosing among possible reforms will be that the budget for the Armed Forces and military-industrial complex is limited. One of the main requirements will be to minimize the country's budget for defense. This, in turn, means that the established practice of allocating funds equally among the existing branches of the Armed Forces will have to be abandoned.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It is necessary to determine which programs are crucial to sustaining the Armed Forces' ability to accomplish their main objectives and guarantee their financing. At the same time, it is unavoidable that programs which do not have a high priority will have to be financed from the "leftovers" of the military budget. Despite the importance of the transition to a professional army in the near future, it will be impossible to avoid using the draft to raise manpower. The Armed Forces will have to be reduced to 1.2 million servicemen.
<p>
<b>The Main Deterrent: Strategic Nuclear Forces</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In resolving the task of nuclear deterrence on the strategic level, the basic role should be played by strategic nuclear forces and systems supporting their combat functioning. Without strategic nuclear forces, Russia cannot exist as an independent, unified state. The task of sustaining them should be given the highest priority and should be fully financed. As of today, [Russia's] strategic nuclear forces face three major problems:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Degradation of strategic nuclear forces.</b> This concerns primarily the naval component of the strategic nuclear forces, in which the scheduled maintenance of weapon systems is constantly being violated and the operational strength of strategic nuclear submarines has gone down drastically. Since 1990, not a single new strategic nuclear submarine has been launched; considering the life cycle of submarines in the naval strategic nuclear forces, this means they could disappear within 15 years. It is most important to finish the scientific research and test construction work needed to create strategic nuclear submarines of a new generation which will carry new ballistic missiles by the years 2000-2003, as well as to ensure that these strategic nuclear submarines are brought into service at the rate of 2-3 submarines every two years.
<p>
<li><b>Absence of clarity regarding the quantitative framework within which it is planned to develop strategic nuclear forces.</b> In 1994, START I was implemented. START II was signed but is not yet ratified. With regard to the naval and aviation components of the strategic nuclear forces, the existence of uncertainty concerning the fate of the treaty does not affect seriously their future development. According to START II, the naval strategic nuclear forces can be armed with 1,750 warheads after 2003. Roughly the same quantity was to be allowed under START I. Aviation strategic nuclear forces, which historically have played a very insignificant role in the national nuclear triad, will have 93 heavy bombers with approximately 500 cruise missiles, including 19 Tu-95 heavy bombers and several dozen heavy bombers acquired in Ukraine by agreement. The production of additional heavy bombers is very costly and thus is hardly advisable.
<p>
A more complex situation exists in units of the Strategic Rocket Forces (SRF). According to START II, which requires the liquidation of ICBMs with MIRV warheads, the SRF by the year 2003 can rely on approximately 1,000 single-warhead ICBMs. At present, there are 350 mobile SS-25s with single warheads, which are to be replaced in the next few years, as their useful life expires, by "Topol-M" ICBMs. According to the agreement, Russia will have 105 MIRVed ICBMs, which are to be "unloaded" until only one warhead each remains, and 90 single SS-18 ICBMs placed into refitted silos. To support the START II quota for the number of warheads, Russia will have to form more than 10 additional divisions of mobile ICBMs with approximately 500 "Topol-M" ICBMs by the year 2003 -- in other words, practically double the number of mobile, single-warhead ICBMs. Another possible option is to build new silos for new ICBMs. Even with priority financing, it is very difficult for the SRF to do this within such a limited time frame.
<p>
In general, the START II treaty is rather paradoxical. It calls for quick liquidation of more than 200 MIRVed Russian ICBMs, part of which could still be used for another 4-5 years. At the same time, in order to maintain quantitative parity with the U.S., several hundred single-warhead ICBMs should be deployed, and possibly placed into newly built silos, even as some of the old silos are to be destroyed under START II. Note that the United States plans to go from START I to START II in a different fashion. It will eliminate only 50 "MX" missiles, 4 "Ohio" strategic nuclear submarines, and 28 heavy bombers with cruise missiles. The main cuts are to be accomplished by "unloading" the missiles and storing the warheads in special storage facilities. At any moment, this stockpile, which the United States emphatically refuses to destroy, might be put back into operation on U.S. missiles. As a result, taking into account the potential for "quick loading" of these missiles, the U.S. will surpass Russia by 1,000-1,500 warheads.
<P>
Russia's refusal to follow START II will bring onto the agenda the issue of supporting MIRVed ICBMs. Analysis proves that this problem can be solved in principle. Different options are available. For instance, additional SS-18s can be purchased from Ukraine. Also, purely Russian MIRVed ICBMs can be designed; a 120-ton liquid fueled missile with 10 warheads could be created in 3-5 years after the appropriate decision. In the next 5-7 years, 300 such missiles can be placed into existing silos. Given these facts, in spite of widespread misconceptions, spending for this project could be quite moderate. At the stage of scientific research and test construction work, the amount would be several percent less per year than the amount allocated to "rebuild" Chechnya in 1996. At the development stage, given that the warheads would be available, production and installation of 300 of such missiles would be three times cheaper than the cost of constructing in the same period 500 "Topol-M" ICBMs in their mobile version or in new silos, as discussed above in relation to START II.
<p>
<li><b>Flaws in the command and control structure of the strategic nuclear forces.</b> It is proposed, within the framework of measures for development of the strategic nuclear forces, to design in an organized manner a single, self-contained operational command and control system for all groupings of strategic nuclear forces, including support systems, based on the administrative structure developed in the Strategic Rocket Forces. Practical implementation of this proposal could be achieved within a year after the appropriate decision is made. The main reasons such a step is necessary are the increased demands for combat readiness in the strategic nuclear forces, economy of means, and elimination of parallel structures. It would be advisable to transfer the Military Space Forces to the Strategic Rocket Forces to bring under their functional control the Missile Attack Warning System, the Space Control System, the Moscow ABM System, and corresponding testing sites. The naval and aviation strategic nuclear forces (functionally left in the Navy and Air Forces, respectively) also should be transferred to the single operational command and control of the strategic nuclear forces.
<p>
At the present time, several hundred thousand servicemen, a third of them officers, are performing their military service in groupings of the strategic nuclear forces. In the Strategic Rocket Forces, for all practical purposes, combat crews of officers carry out in practice 100 percent of the direct functional duties connected with exploitation of the weapons. As for the draftees, they primarily carry out functions as guards and perform auxiliary tasks in supporting combat readiness, technical support, etc. A similar situation, as a whole, characterizes the other components of the strategic nuclear forces and their support systems. It is proposed that the ratio between professionals and conscripts be maintained in the future as well.
<p>
Since the U.S. and NATO possess conventional forces and armaments potentially sufficient to conduct military operations with limited goals on the periphery of post-Soviet territory, it is necessary to provide for deterrence of such actions by the probable enemy. Currently, functions for deterring aggression from the most probable directions are given:
<ul><p>
<li>In the north (the naval bases on the Kola peninsula), to forces of the Leningrad Military District (MD) and Northern Fleet (NF).
<p>
<li>In the northwest, (the Baltic region), to forces of the Leningrad MD, Kaliningrad special region, and forces of the Baltic Fleet.
<p>
<li>In the south (the Caucasus-Caspian region), to forces of the North Caucasus Military district; subunits of the Russian Armed Forces on bases in Gyumri and Yerevan (Armenia), Tbilisi and Ahalkalaki (Georgia), Batumi (Adjaria), and Gudauta (Abkhazia); forces of the Caspian Flotilla; and the Black Sea fleet.
</ul><p>
Analysis shows that the existing deterrence potential of the Russian Federation Armed Forces in these directions might be insufficient to deter aggressive action by the probable enemy. Strengthening these forces by carrying out a long-term buildup in the number of troops and armaments in regions of probable conflict could be hard to achieve economically. In light of this, as a priority task facing the Armed Forces, it is proposed to create, within a year after a decision is made, Operational-Tactical Deterrent Forces numbering about 10,000 servicemen. Operational-Tactical Deterrent Forces could operate as a reserve of the Supreme High Command and, on a long-term basis, could assume the function of deterring the probable enemy from conducting military operations with local goals.
<p>
For this proposal to be implemented at the initial stage, it is suggested to supply the Operational-Tactical Deterrent Forces with 10-12 missile and aviation complexes equipped with conventional precision weapons from the Rocket Forces, Ground Forces, and Air Forces. These missile and aviation complexes, while remaining functionally a part of the Rocket Forces, Ground Forces, and Air Forces, and based deep within Russian territory during peacetime, would be subordinated operationally, through a Main Directorate of the General Staff specially created for these purposes, to the Supreme High Command of the Russian Armed Forces. During a threatening period, Operational-Tactical Deterrent Forces, by decision of the Supreme High Command, could be redeployed to the region of possible conflict and aimed on especially important targets deep in the probable enemy's territory.
<p>
In the event plans for the eastern expansion of NATO are realized or new directions of possible aggression appear (for instance, the Southern Kuril Island), it would be expedient to increase the number of the Operational-Tactical Deterrent Forces' missile and aviation complexes to 30-50 units. At the same time, units of missile artillery and aviation complexes could be armed with nuclear weapons. To demonstrate persuasively to a probable enemy the RF's determination to impede any NATO advancement into the territory of the former USSR, some Operational-Tactical Deterrent Force units also could be moved up to the borders, particularly the Russian-Norwegian border; to Russian military bases in Armenia, Georgia, Adzharia, and Abkhazia; to the Kaliningrad special region; and into Belorussia, to which President A. G. Lukashenko has agreed in principle.
</ul><P>
<b>The Mobile Forces: Mainstay of the Russian Army</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It is advisable when waging local wars within the former USSR to give the main functions to special elite units: Mobile Forces of the Russian Federation Armed Forces, which also must have priority designation. Not intended for participation in extended military conflicts, these units could be used on a short-term basis in holding actions and to repel aggression from abroad against Russia and the CIS using conventional weapons. They also could be designated for peacekeeping operations under the aegis of CIS, as well as the UN and other international organizations. It is advisable to form Mobile Forces, up to 90,000 strong, based on Airborne troops and using some units of naval infantry, over a year after a corresponding decision is made. Functionally, naval infantry would stay under Navy command and would be transferred to operational Mobile Forces command only for the conduct of special operations.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For five years after forming these Mobile Forces, it is suggested that recruitment be exclusively on a contract basis. After the process of turning them into a professional force is complete, Mobile Forces should be fully staffed and given all kinds of heavy armaments and equipment. Moreover, the number of naval infantry should be increased with the assistance of the Baltic Fleet, Black Sea Fleet, and Caspian Flotilla, which are located in potential conflict areas of the Caucasus and Baltic countries. Special attention should be paid to the creation of naval infantry in the Caspian region because of the extremely high probability of conflict arising from the unresolved problem of the status of the Caspian shelf.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It is important to equip Mobile Forces with military transport aviation (MTA), which will belong functionally to the Air Forces and be operationally subordinate to the Commander in Chief of the Air Forces but required to carry out orders of the Mobile Forces. The need for MTA aircraft designated to move personnel and military equipment, including heavy military equipment, is estimated at 100 aircraft. Most of the aircraft in MTA available today are not functioning. Therefore, about 30-40 additional aircraft should be brought into service because of the extreme importance of the tasks performed by the Mobile Forces.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A typical special operation involving Mobile Forces and aimed at liberating a large area of the former USSR from nationalists should be based on the following principles. The commander of the operation is appointed and should receive a legally valid order. The date and time of the operation then are set. A rigid system of unified command is established so that operational command over all utilized forces, regardless of departmental subordination and affiliation, is concentrated in the hands of a single person.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In the first stage, aviation, special military intelligence (GRU) forces, and special Federal Security Services (FSB) and Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) groups carry out strikes for the purpose of destroying or seizing the most important enemy targets and eliminating the enemy's military and political leadership. Then Mobile Forces, with the support of army and frontline aviation and naval forces, crush and eliminate enemy forces and take over their territory. After that, subunits of Ground Forces and Internal Troops of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, RF, preferably with some combat experience, move in. They establish control of the most crucial locations and carry out "cleansing" of the territory. Then, with the help of militia formed out of the pro-Russian part of the local population, they establish control over the territory and ensure the elimination of nationalists and deportation of some categories of citizens from certain locations. It should be emphasized that until the end of the special operation, local authorities are needed only insofar as they are useful in supporting military control over the territory.
<P>
<b>Winners and Losers</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Military intelligence plays a most important role in achieving the main goals of the Armed Forces. Making the GRU (Main Intelligence Directorate) and its subunits and structures more effective should be given the highest priority.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To implement these proposals, half the personnel of the Armed Forces would have to go to the four most important components of the Armed Forces named above, which also should be given priority in financing. Because the economic situation in the country is difficult, the other half of the Armed Forces would have to exist under tight financial limitations.
<ul><p>
<li><b>The Navy is the most expensive of the Armed Forces.</b> A differentiated approach is needed here. Naval strategic nuclear forces cannot be underfinanced. The situation is more complex with respect to providing for the combat stability of naval strategic nuclear forces. The system exists and should be preserved, but this does not require building large ships. Aircraft carriers are an exception, since two carriers each are needed in the Pacific Fleet and Northern Fleet to meet military goals. There are only two at present, and the country's economic situation does not allow for two more.
<p>
To provide for anti-submarine warfare in oceanic theaters of military operations (TVD), there are in service submarines and ships equipped with special arms. This equipment should be maintained and ships and submarines currently under construction should be finished, but no new ones should be built for the time being.
<p>

With respect to combating enemy aircraft carriers, there are no battle groups now in place. Our recommendation is to maintain the status quo and concentrate on retaining existing levels.
<p>
With reference to landing support for naval infantry, the appropriate infrastructure was built by the USSR. It is important not only to stop its destruction, but also to continue its development, since costs will not be high but will allow it to perform tasks of the Mobile Forces with great effectiveness.
<p>
In protecting sea communications, special attention should be paid to protecting lines of communication with the Kaliningrad Special Region. At the same time, activities in the remote oceanic regions should be limited.
<p>
The existing system for the coastal defense of the Russian Federation should be supported and developed, since no big investments are needed here. Finally, it is necessary to abandon the tasks of combating transatlantic shipments of U.S. forces and combating the enemy's surface ships and submarines armed with cruise missiles.
<p>
<li><b>There are two large groups in the Ground Forces today. </b>One was deployed in the Far East Military District and Trans-Baikal Military District during the time of tense relations with China. In subsequent years, it was degraded less than other groups. Another large group was developed for obvious reasons in the North Caucasus Military District. It is reasonable to continue to support these groups. For the North Caucasus Military District, this means confirming the exception of District units from the treaty on Conventional Forces Reductions in Europe at the May conference of participants. It is unacceptable that the issue of the North Caucasus Military District be linked with the proposal made by a number of countries that the numbers of Russian forces in the Kaliningrad Special Region be cut; in light of Poland's and the Baltic countries' plans to join NATO, the very fact that the issue of the Kaliningrad Special Region has come up seems both ambiguous and a provocation. A limited number of Ground Forces are located in the strategically important Leningrad and Moscow Military Districts. From the west, Moscow is covered by only two army divisions. As there is no danger of a large-scale invasion of Russia similar to the invasion of 1941, the development of forces to the west of Moscow should not be hurried. But in the event the Eastern European countries join NATO and the infrastructure for an invasion force appears, Russia will be forced to respond accordingly. One possible response might be to recreate the Belorussian Military District and deploy Ground Forces and frontal aviation of the Air Forces there.
<p>
Also, since it currently is difficult for Russia to maintain parity with NATO in conventional weapons, the primary emphasis should be assigned to tactical nuclear deterrence of the threat of non-nuclear attack by NATO forces. This approach will require arming the Rocket Forces, Ground Forces, and frontal aviation of the Air Forces with nuclear weapons and will be much less expensive than providing a non-nuclear deterrent force for a non-nuclear invasion. In general, the present weakness of Russia dictates reliance on nuclear weapons, including tactical weapons. Today, the only possible way to deter NATO is through nuclear deterrence. At the same time, should the relationship between Russia and China change, the same approach can be used in Central Asia and the Far East.
<p>
An important problem in the Ground Forces is revision of the list of units in military districts and the discovery of units which can be cut. It is advisable to limit the number of divisions to 30-35, of which 15-20 could be manned with conscripts and work on combat readiness while the other 15, evenly spread around the country, would be cadre and would serve as a base in preparing the mobilization reserve. At the same time, preparation of the mobilization reserve should be conducted within the Internal Troops of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) and Border Guards.
<p>
<li><b>In units of the Air Forces, special attention should be concentrated on maintaining military transport, frontal aviation, and aviation of the strategic nuclear forces, which could be used by the Operational-Tactical Deterrent Forces and Mobile Forces, at the required level.</b> A major task is preserving qualifications of flying personnel. The Air Defense of military districts should be given to the Air Forces from the Troops of Air Defense, disbanding the latter units but retaining their combat readiness requirements. The missile attack warning system, space control system, and Moscow ABM System, as well as their corresponding testing grounds, would be transferred to the Strategic Rocket Forces. The Air Defense system that is maintaining CIS perimeter defense also would be transferred to the Air Force. Another possible solution is to give it to the Federal Border Guard Service. This would be logical, because they are not now able to defend against a massive air attack from the probable enemy. The circle of tasks resolved by them, in fact, is limited to early warning of an unsanctioned intrusion of CIS airspace and interception of individual targets. This is more a function of the Border Guard, not the Armed Forces. Moreover, the Federal Border Guard Service looks after the ground and marine border. It would be logical to close the loop by giving them the air component as well.
<p></ul>
<b>Legislative Priorities</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It is proposed that in the immediate future, it is necessary to prepare and confirm in the Federal Assembly (parliament) a national security doctrine and a military doctrine for the Russian Federation. Based on these doctrines, a five-year plan of reform for the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation should be developed and adopted.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This current document can be used both to prepare the national security and military doctrines and to prepare the plan of reform for the Armed Forces.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b><BR>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
On May 20, President Bill Clinton announced his intention to extend unconditionally China's most-favored-nation trade status for another year. At the end of this month, Congress will vote on a resolution to revoke MFN trade status for the People's Republic of China. Legislation also may be proposed to make MFN status contingent on improvements in China's human rights conditions or its implementation of international commercial and security agreements.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

As Congress considers extending or revoking MFN status for China, it is important to focus on what MFN is and is not. A fundamental principle of the Bretton Woods trading system created at the end of World War II,<sup>1</sup> MFN was intended to protect the U.S. from protectionism. It is not a special privilege for any country, including China. Rather, it is the norm for trade between countries. Thus, revoking MFN for any country is the equivalent of imposing enormous punitive sanctions. But trade sanctions are not an effective tool for achieving such non-trade objectives as ending human rights abuses.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

The Administration's decision to extend MFN treatment is the right decision, but it should be only one element of a comprehensive strategy for dealing with China. This strategy should consist of a series of policies that directly protect or promote long-run U.S. interests in Asia, such as free access to markets or peace and stability. As important as having the right strategy is creating a constructive environment within which policies can operate. This environment has not been created by the Clinton Administration. The zig-zags in its China policy have undermined the credibility of its strategy and raised serious questions in the minds of friend and foe alike as to America's future role in Asia.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

To protect its interests in peace and stability, freedom of the seas, and access to markets in Asia, the U.S. must create an environment that encourages China to integrate into the international system as a responsible member. Given its size and rate of growth, China is certain to have an enormous impact on the international system and American interests in Asia. For China to become a full participant in the international system and uphold international rules and norms, Chinese leaders must see that doing so will best serve China's interests. This can be accomplished only if Americans interact with, rather than isolate, China.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 


To advance American interests in Asia, the President and Congress should:<ul>
<p><li>Renew China's MFN status. This is the right decision and should be supported by the Congress.

<p><li><b>Invite China's President Jiang Zemin to the White House for a full state visit.</b> This gesture could help avoid future misunderstandings by directly communicating America's fundamental Asian interests and concerns at the highest level.

<p><li><b>Follow a more broad-based strategy toward Asia.</b> Rather than confront China directly, the U.S. should seek to expand investment and trade with India and Indonesia. Knowing that the U.S. has credible alternatives to the China market, China's leaders will no longer be able to take American involvement in China for granted.

<p><li><b>Use policy tools better suited to the problem.</b> When China violates a U.S. law or international agreement, the U.S. should apply the penalty prescribed in that law or agreement. In other words, if China violates the Missile Control Technology Regime, the U.S. should coordinate its response with other MCTR members and apply the sanctions outlined in the law that ratified U.S. membership in that regime. The U.S. should not revoke MFN or impose sanctions that are not relevant to the specific broken law or agreement.

<p><li><b>Repeal or amend the Jackson-Vanik Amendment.</b> This amendment to the 1974 Trade Act is outdated. Its primary target no longer exists, and its freedom of emigration requirements are inappropriate for China. </ul><p>


<b>AMERICA'S STRATEGIC INTERESTS AND MFN</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

Over the past two centuries, the U.S. has sought consistently to protect three fundamental interests in Asia: 1) regional peace and stability, 2) freedom of navigation on the high seas, and 3) free access to the region's markets. These interests provide a firm foundation for a healthy and growing American economy. They also help promote a stable and secure world in which political and economic freedom, human rights, and democratic institutions can flourish. These interests allow the U.S. to maintain a system of healthy, cooperative, and politically vigorous relations with allies and friendly nations.<sup>2</sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

MFN plays a fundamental role in advancing these enduring American interests in Asia. Most-favored-nation treatment is the normal tariff treatment that the United States provides to all but a handful of its trading partners.<sup>3</sup>  It is a principle which undergirds the open international trading system that the U.S. has labored for decades to expand, not merely a bargaining chip in the U.S.-China relationship that holds America's trade and economic interests around the globe hostage to the ups and downs of its political relationship with China. MFN has been, in fact, a key ingredient of America's global strategy since World War II. The purpose of this strategy has been to build a cooperative free-trade environment within which America's businesses and economy can prosper. It also has been to protect the United States and the world from reliving the tragic consequences of the isolationism and protectionism that plagued the 1930s.
<P>

<b>HISTORICAL ROOTS OF MFN STATUS FOR CHINA</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

	The U.S. first introduced the notion of most-favored-nation trade status into the U.S.-China relationship in the 19th century to ensure the survival of American commercial interests in Asia. After the Opium Wars of the mid-19th century, several foreign powers won concessions from China and sought to establish exclusive areas of influence along China's coast. American leaders considered these actions a threat to the U.S. interest in free access to the markets of Asia. In order to keep Britain, Germany, Japan, or China from excluding the U.S. from the Chinese market, the U.S. induced China to agree to an MFN provision in its treaty obligations with the U.S.<sup>4</sup>  This provision required that any future concession that the Chinese government granted to a third power would be extended simultaneously and automatically to the U.S. as well. MFN was not considered a tool by which America would realize the full potential of the enormous Chinese market. Rather, it was one means by which the U.S. could guarantee itself equal access to that market.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

The United States extended MFN status to all of its trading partners as a matter of statutory policy in 1934. The scope of this policy narrowed as the Cold War intensified. Section 5 of the Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1951 required President Truman to suspend the MFN status of the Soviet Union and all countries under the control of international communism. In accordance with this act, the President suspended China's most-favored-nation status on September 1, 1951, approximately two years after the establishment of the People's Republic of China.

The Trade Act of 1974 set forth new conditions for the restoration of MFN to "nonmarket economy" countries such as China.<sup>5</sup>  According to Title IV, in order to grant MFN status to China, the President must satisfy two conditions:
<ul> 

<p><li>Condition #1: A trade agreement that includes MFN for the U.S. Under Section 405 in Title IV of the 1974 Trade Act, in order to conclude a trade agreement with China, the President must first determine that any reductions in U.S. trade barriers are reciprocated by China. In other words, as the U.S. lowers tariffs on imports from China, China simultaneously will reduce tariffs on U.S. exports to China.

<p><li>Condition #2: Freedom of emigration. This second requirement is much more contentious. Section 402 of the 1974 Trade Act, known as the Jackson-Vanik Amendment, was intended to pressure the Soviet Union to allow Jews to emigrate.<sup>6</sup>  Over time, this provision has become, albeit inadvertently, the legal basis for the current annual debate over renewal of China's MFN status. The Amendment calls on the President to deny MFN treatment to any nonmarket economy country which the President determines denies, seriously restricts, or burdens its citizens' right to emigrate. This freedom of emigration requirement can be waived annually, and it is around this annual waiver that the current debate over China's MFN status revolves.</ul>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

In the process of normalizing relations with the PRC, President Jimmy Carter in 1979 used presidential authority to conclude a three-year bilateral trade agreement with China in which China granted MFN status to the U.S. This satisfied the first requirement for granting MFN to a nonmarket economy country. The U.S. trade agreement with China, which entered into force on February 1, 1980, provides for automatic three-year extensions. Since China is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 405 of the 1974 Trade Act, however, these "automatic" extensions require the President to certify that China reciprocates reductions in U.S. trade barriers. Thus far, the trade agreement has been renewed five times.<sup>7</sup>
<P>


<b>MFN Procedures and China</b><P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

The  problem is that President Carter did not completely resolve the second requirement for extending MFN status to China. To grant MFN to China, the President must determine that China permits free and unrestricted emigration of its citizens or waive for 12 months the requirements for full compliance with Jackson-Vanik. President Carter in 1980 waived the Jackson-Vanik requirements for 12 months rather than certify China's full compliance with its freedom of emigration strictures. This has been done by every President since then. In every June since 1980, the President has had to decide whether or not to waive for another 12 months the freedom of emigration requirements in the Jackson-Vanik Amendment. Moreover, each year after the President's decision has been made, Congress has had an opportunity to review the President's decision and to decide whether to vote on a resolution to discontinue MFN.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

According to the procedures outlined in Section 402 of the 1974 Trade Act, once the President has waived the Jackson-Vanik requirements, he must submit to Congress a recommendation for a 12-month extension of the waiver authority. This recommendation, along with the President's reasons for granting it, must be submitted to Congress during the final 30 days of the current waiver. The President's recommendation traditionally has been sent by June 3 of each year. Extension of the waiver authority is automatic unless a joint resolution of disapproval is enacted into law within 60 days after the expiration of the previous waiver authority, which typically is by the end of August. Although resolutions of disapproval have been considered by Congress, MFN treatment for China has continued uninterrupted since 1980 under annual renewal of the waiver.
<p>

<b>ISSUES ENTANGLED IN MFN DEBATE</b><P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

	Automatic extension of the three-year U.S. trade agreement with China and the annual presidential waiver of Jackson-Vanik requirements went smoothly throughout the 1980s, as China embarked on massive and largely successful economic reforms. Market capitalism was introduced incrementally into the Chinese economy to improve efficiency and to hasten modernization. Many in China readily admitted the failures of socialism and looked to the West for new methods to improve living standards. President Ronald Reagan visited China in 1984 and declared the dawning of a new era of freedom for the Chinese people.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

But this honeymoon in Sino-American relations came to an abrupt halt on June 4, 1989, when the People's Liberation Army used deadly force against the students and workers who had gathered in protest at Tiananmen Square. In response, President George Bush invoked a series of sanctions against China. These included restrictions on arms and munitions sales, military exchanges, transfer of dual-use technologies, and U.S. government financing for projects in China. The objective was to punish the government of China without unnecessarily injuring the people of China. This same rationale was advanced to explain the continuation of MFN status for China. Revoking MFN would have injured a wide range of people in China that the U.S. wanted to help, including economic reformers and entrepreneurs.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

A majority in Congress, however, did not agree with the President's decision. Each year, from 1990-1992, Congress voted to disapprove extension of MFN status to China. President Bush repeatedly used his veto authority to defeat these congressional resolutions. Members of Congress argued that the U.S. should make China's leaders pay for their brutality and that it was immoral for Americans to seek profit under such circumstances. Every year, this "automatic" procedure has provided a forum for a well-orchestrated recitation of all the ills for which China's government is held responsible.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

Four years ago, candidate Bill Clinton scolded President Bush for "coddling tyrants" and vowed to make the "butchers of Beijing" pay by attaching requirements for improved human rights conditions to the continuation of MFN for China. This was his intention when on May 28, 1993, President Clinton issued an executive order which continued China's unconditional MFN status for another year but attached new conditions to China's renewal in subsequent years.<sup>8</sup>  The executive order required China to halt exports of prison labor products to the U.S. and mandated that the Secretary of State determine whether China had made "significant progress" on human rights.<sup>9</sup>  After a year of strained diplomatic relations, President Clinton, despite his campaign threats, renewed China's MFN status on May 26, 1994. He did so without declaring that China had made significant progress in human rights protection, effectively de-linking human rights from trade issues.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

Although human rights has been the most prominent rallying cry for those who wish to discontinue MFN for China, there are a number of other issues that give Americans cause for concern: China's military adventurism, proliferation of missiles and nuclear technology, piracy of intellectual property, and unbalanced trade. These concerns are legitimate and are being addressed in varying degrees through diplomacy. The danger in the political debate over China is that the U.S. will try to use MFN, one of the fundamental principles of international trade, as a policy tool to advance unrelated economic, political, and security interests.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

Revoking China's MFN status clearly is not an effective way to advance these interests. Certainly, China's bullying of Taiwan with missile tests interfered with international air and sea lanes and had the potential to draw the U.S. into military conflict with the PRC.<sup>10</sup>  It also put at risk peace and stability in Asia as well as freedom of navigation -- two of the three historical U.S. interests in Asia. However, revoking MFN would do nothing to stop these provocative acts. Nor would it improve the prospects for peace and stability or freedom of navigation generally. But it would violate the U.S. interest in free access to markets and free trade. Thus, while revoking MFN will affect neither China's position on human rights nor its intimidation of Taiwan, it certainly will violate a vital U.S. economic interest.
<p>

<b>Policy Solutions That Fit Policy Problems</b>

<p><b>Human Rights.</b> Rather than revoke MFN, the U.S. should craft a policy that deals as directly as possible with the source of the problem. On human rights, for example, the U.S. has been following a pattern of publicly demonizing China's leaders and then trying to negotiate quietly with these leaders for release of high-profile political prisoners and changes in PRC law. The problem with this approach is that by threatening and demonizing the PRC government, the U.S. cuts off access to those whom Americans seek to help. This tactic does not leave Chinese leaders in the mood to find consensus on these issues, and by focusing attention on a few high-profile dissidents, the U.S. risks being viewed by the Chinese people as caring only for a few superstars while ignoring the interests of the many ordinary people.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

There is a more effective way to address human rights concerns in China. The U.S. should create a positive public relationship with China's leaders while vigorously raising these legitimate moral concerns in private. To reach the people Americans seek to help, the U.S. could send more volunteers and supplies to provide direct assistance to China's orphans and poor. The U.S. also should seek to increase as much as possible people-to-people contact between the two countries, whether through business or education, to increase cross-fertilization of cultural values and understanding.

<p><b>Weapons Proliferation.</b> The U.S. intelligence community has reported Chinese sales of nuclear technology to Pakistan and nuclear capable missiles to Pakistan and Iran. The Administration is required to confirm these reports and to determine whether such transactions violate U.S. law and international agreements such as the Missile Technology Control Regime and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.<sup>11</sup>  If violations of U.S. law and international agreements are confirmed, the U.S. is obliged to invoke sanctions against China. While the Clinton Administration has threatened to impose sanctions, it has yet to determine officially whether actual violations have occurred. In addition, the threatened sanctions would only take funding away from American-run projects and would have little effect on China, as European and Japanese competitors would immediately fill the void.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

The more effective approach to curbing China's proliferation problems is to work through the multilateral dispute resolution mechanisms within the Missile Technology Control Regime and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Unilateral enforcement of U.S. law, while justified if violations are confirmed, may not have the intended effect on China's behavior. Non-proliferation is an area in which cooperation with treaty partners and allies is not only critical, but also possible. A security threat is much more likely to produce international cooperation than is an economic or trade issue. Without the support of Europe and Japan, any sanction will quickly be undercut and rendered ineffective. Thus, to maximize the likelihood of success, it is important for the U.S. to have its allies' support in dealing with China, working as much as possible through the mechanisms built into international non-proliferation treaties and regimes. 

<p><b>Selling Pirated Goods.</b> With regard to intellectual property rights, officials in the U.S. software, motion picture, and computer industries have accused dozens of factories in China's southern Guangdong Province of illegally copying U.S. products and selling the pirated goods abroad. These officials estimate the damage to their industries in lost sales at $2.3 billion. In 1992, in 1995, and again in 1996, China signed agreements with the U.S. Trade Representative promising to crack down on these pirates. In May 1996, in an effort to motivate Chinese enforcement of its agreements, the U.S. Trade Representative threatened to impose sanctions totaling $2 billion on Chinese textile exports from Guangdong Province.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

Indirect sanctions on textile manufacturers in Guangdong Province, while consistent with the spirit of enforcing the rule of law, do not address the source of the problem. Many of these illegal compact disk producers are operated solely or jointly by Taiwan and Hong Kong businessmen, and some have ties to organized crime. Thus, the U.S. cannot hope to press China alone to deal effectively with this problem. Only a carefully planned, well organized cooperative effort by the PRC, ROC, Hong Kong, and U.S. governments can possibly be successful.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

There is a more effective way for the U.S. to address the piracy problem. If American companies can locate these illegal manufacturers, they should also be able to identify the shipping container in which the pirated goods are packaged for export. With the consent of PRC and Hong Kong officials, once the container is identified, port authorities in Hong Kong can locate and seize the pirated goods that are targeted for export markets. Seizing the goods would affect the perpetrators but very few others, unlike indirect sanctions which, like a swinging axe, harm many in the hope of punishing the guilty few. In addition, international markets serviced by Hong Kong's exporters are the appropriate target. China's own consumers lack sufficient computer and audio hardware to generate the sustained demand necessary to make these pirates profitable.

<b>EIGHT REASONS TO CONTINUE MFN FOR CHINA</b>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Since MFN is so fundamental to U.S. global commercial strategy, there are several reasons why the U.S. should continue to extend it to China. Revoking MFN for China would:<ul>

<p><li><b>Harm American workers.</b> In 1995, the U.S. exported over $12 billion in goods and services to China. American trade with China supports over 200,000 high-wage American jobs, as well as tens of thousands of additional American jobs in U.S. ports, retail establishments, and consumer goods companies. The loss of exports from the inevitable Chinese retaliation against MFN revocation would seriously threaten the employment of these Americans.

<p><li><b>Threaten U.S. business and investment.</b> The International Monetary Fund estimates that China is now the world's third-largest economy after the United States and Japan, and could emerge as the world's largest economy in the 21st century. The World Bank has calculated China that will require nearly $750 billion in new industrial infrastructure over the next decade. China needs new aircraft, power generators, telecommunications, computers, and other high-skill, high-wage technologies that must be supplied from overseas. American companies are poised to get the contracts to build these projects. Continued American leadership in these key technology sectors is vital to sustaining long-term U.S. economic growth and creating high-wage, high-skill American jobs. If MFN is revoked, China's needs will be filled by Japanese and European business and investment, with American jobs lost to overseas competitors.

<p><li><b>Jeopardize economic reform in China.</b> The last 15 years of economic reform in China have increased economic freedom and improved the livelihood of 25 percent of the world's population. American companies operating in China have contributed to a significant expansion of economic freedom and choice for the Chinese people. The U.S. must build on this foundation to open China's economy and society even more. MFN will not guarantee the rise of democracy in China, but does it keep China open to influences and pressures from the outside world. It fosters the development of a middle class and a civil society that in the future will have the means and the will to demand more responsiveness from its government.

<p><li><b>Damage the economies of Taiwan and Hong Kong.</b> The prosperity of both Taiwan and Hong Kong depends to a significant degree on investment and export production in China. The revocation of MFN would cut Hong Kong's economic growth in half. Although this point is rarely discussed, billions of dollars in Taiwanese investment and labor-intensive industries have moved to the mainland, unabated by the recent tensions. Many of the light industrial goods on which Taiwan's economic miracle depends are now produced on the mainland and exported through Hong Kong to the United States and other markets. Threats of across-the-board tariff increases, MFN revocation, and boycotting of Chinese goods ignore the fact that many of the goods marked "Made in China" actually are produced by companies based in Hong Kong and Taiwan, both friends of the U.S.

<p><li><b>Not improve human rights conditions in China.</b> History shows that China oppresses its people far more during periods of isolation. This clearly was the case in the Cultural Revolution of the late 1960s. Human rights improvement is a long-term process that requires U.S. attention, but also U.S. patience. It is a process that does not lend itself to annual review. Nevertheless, Taiwan's success in improving the economic and political well-being of its citizens demonstrates that this transition is both possible and desirable in a Chinese society.

<p><li><b>Not encourage China to adhere to international limitations on transfers of nuclear technology or weapons of mass destruction.</b> China should answer the charges that it is supplying Pakistan with key nuclear and missile components in violation of its commitments to the Missile Technology Control Regime and the Non-Proliferation Treaty. The Administration must investigate these allegations and, if such sales have taken place, apply sanctions as required by U.S. law. The law, however, needs to be changed. These sanctions, if not waived by the President, should be targeted specifically on the responsible Chinese enterprise rather than indiscriminately on all U.S.-financed projects in China as the law requires. Revoking MFN would go even further than the sanctions called for under current law, adversely affecting all U.S. commercial interaction with China. In the past, China has shown its displeasure with America's overtures to Taiwan or criticism of China's human rights record by selling dangerous technology to unstable regimes. Revoking MFN could generate another series of sales. In the area of non-proliferation, MFN is the wrong tool.

<p><li><b>Unnecessarily set the U.S. on the road to prolonged confrontation with China.</b> Abandoning MFN for China would make it less likely that China would integrate into the international system in a way that is favorable to U.S. interests. For the United States to realize its policy objectives most effectively, Beijing should not be an enemy. If U.S. policymakers wish to see China behave in a way that is consistent with international norms and agreements, they should work for multilateral cooperation with allies rather than engage in ineffective bilateral browbeating. How best to promote China's integration into the international commercial and security system will be among the most important challenges for American foreign policy in the foreseeable future. It warrants more deliberation and care from the President, his administration, and Congress.

<p><li><b>Violate a U.S. interest in free trade and a more open China.</b> The term "MFN" is misleading and should be changed. "General trading status" (GTS) would be a good alternative. Together with national treatment, MFN is a fundamental principle by which the World Trade Organization operates. It is normal trade status granted to all but a handful of countries -- North Korea, Cuba, Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam -- none of which has any substantial global trade. It is the foundation of basic international commercial relations, and in the absence of the Cold War strategic framework, commercial relations are now the foundation of U.S.-China relations. Revoking MFN means seriously undercutting America's relationship with China.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

For more than a century, U.S. policy has aimed at free access to the markets of Asia. For over half a century, the U.S. has labored to build and strengthen the current liberal international system of trade. In addition to being consistent with these long-term U.S. interests, MFN trade status for China demonstrates American goodwill to the people of China, if not to the government, by extending the U.S. system of free enterprise to raise their living standards and increase their economic freedoms and choices.</ul>
<p>

<b>THE CLINTON RECORD ON CHINA</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

	The President should never have threatened revocation of MFN over human rights concerns when neither he nor the country was prepared to pay the cost of such action. The Secretary of State, ignoring congressional and public interest, should not have assured Foreign Minister Qian Qichen that Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui would not be granted entry into the United States only days before the visa was granted. Similarly, Administration officials should not have equivocated, delayed, and apologized for action taken in support of U.S. interests in Taiwan. Each of these blunders severely damaged U.S. credibility in dealing with China and created a negative bilateral environment that renders the correct policies ineffective.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

The Administration says one thing but does another. It has managed the relationship with China badly. The Chinese are told that the Administration is following a policy of engagement. Engagement, however, is not a policy; it is simply another word for diplomacy. The U.S. needs engagement -- and diplomacy -- with a purpose. The Clinton Administration now lacks such a purpose. The purpose of U.S. policy toward China should be to communicate to Chinese leaders that China's interests will be served best by integrating into the international system, observing its norms and standards, and pursuing peace and stability in Asia in ways that are commensurate with the interests of the U.S. and China's Asian neighbors.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

To deliver this message, President Clinton needs to meet personally with Chinese leaders. The President received Gerry Adams and Yasser Arafat in the White House, but forced the PRC head of state to meet instead in New York without the fanfare of a full state visit. This message is not lost on the Chinese leadership, and the mere promise of frequent high-level summits to take place in a second Clinton Administration, as proposed by Secretary of State Warren Christopher this May in New York, is little consolation. Frequent face-to-face interaction between the leaders of the United States and China at the highest levels is critical for the protection of American interests in Asia. This interaction should take place in both capitals and in a formal setting that reflects the importance the U.S. attaches to achieving these American interests through cooperation.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

This strategy is the best way to make progress on areas of concern to the United States. Americans frustrated with the lack of progress in China on human rights, missile proliferation, or intellectual property rights, instead of more promises, need a clear, consistent, and predictable China policy to avoid miscalculation in the Taiwan Strait and to make progress on these issues.

<p>
<b>TOWARD A CHINA POLICY THAT WORKS</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

	There is much that can be done to work more effectively toward American goals in Asia. China's cooperation in areas which do not conflict with its own interests will make U.S. efforts easier and less costly. There is little chance of charting a policy course that follows common interests without regular and consistent communication, at the highest levels, of what each county's objectives and vital interests are in bilateral and regional relations. To create an environment more conducive to an effective policy toward China, the U.S. should:<ul>

<p><li><b>Renew China's MFN status.</b> This is the right decision and should be supported by the Congress. MFN promotes the U.S. interest in free access to Asian markets and provides Americans with greater opportunity to act as an influence for good within China.
<p><li><b>Invite China's President Jiang Zemin to the White House for a full state visit.</b> There is little reason to think that China is fated to become an enemy of the United States. It could happen, but the chances are reduced by dealing directly with China and by maintaining American strength. This is a gesture that could demonstrate that the U.S. is truly "engaged" with a purpose.

<p><li><b>Follow a more broad-based strategy toward Asia</b> The U.S. should avoid putting too many eggs in the China market basket. Rather than confronting China directly, the U.S. should seek to expand investment and trade with India and Indonesia. Both countries are very populous, and both are seeking foreign investment to improve their infrastructure and sustain a high rate of economic growth. Knowing that the U.S. has credible alternatives to the China market, China's leaders will no longer be able to take American involvement as a given.

<p><li><b>Use policy tools better suited to the problem.</b> China must obey the rules of the road in international commerce and security. It is right for the U.S. to seek the enforcement of U.S. law and international agreements, but it should use the dispute resolution mechanisms built into the relevant international regime or apply the recourse outlined in the bilateral agreement or U.S. law that has been violated. The remedy should target as specifically as possible the source of the problem and not cut too broadly across the spectrum of competing American interests in China, Asia, or the world.

<p><li><b>Repeal or amend the Jackson-Vanik Amendment.</b> The Jackson-Vanik Amendment to the 1974 Trade Act is outdated. The Soviet Union, Jackson-Vanik's primary target, exists no more, and China is no longer dominated by international communism. It is even becoming difficult to say that China's is a nonmarket economy. In addition, the amendment's freedom of emigration requirements are inappropriate for China. If China were to permit or encourage free emigration, what countries would be prepared or willing to accept tens or hundreds of millions of Chinese migrants?  Certainly the U.S. would not be willing to accept them. The already strained U.S. immigration and welfare system would be overwhelmed by the vast numbers of Chinese people seeking greater opportunity in America.</ul>
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
The question of whether to continue China's MFN status is once again before the Congress. As Members take this opportunity to assess U.S.-China relations, they should replace the mixed signals sent by the Clinton Administration with a consistent strategy for promoting America's long-term interests in Asia. Because of its size and rate of growth, China will have an enormous impact for good or for ill on U.S. interests. Therefore, it is prudent to improve the management of this critical relationship and to seek China's cooperation before forcing the American and Chinese people to pay the enormous security and economic costs of revoking MFN.

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
The MFN debate unfortunately is caught up in two mistaken beliefs: 1) that MFN is privileged treatment and 2) that revoking MFN would be an effective way to force a favorable change in China's behavior. These beliefs have no basis in reality. Conditioning or revoking MFN under current circumstances would eliminate any possibility of cooperation from Beijing, rendering the U.S. less effective in its efforts to limit transfers of nuclear technology and weapons of mass destruction, correct unfair trade practices, and foster development of the rule of law in Asia. Moreover, discontinuing MFN would not improve social and commercial conditions in China but would come at great cost to Americans and their friends in Hong Kong and Taiwan. For the U.S., revoking or conditioning MFN gains too little and risks too much. For these and many other reasons, most-favored-nation trade status for China should be renewed unconditionally.

<h3>CHINA: FRIEND OR ENEMY?</h3>

<b>By The Honorable Barbara Hackman Franklin</b>
<P>Barbara Hackman Franklin is the former U.S. Secretary of Commerce, and spoke at <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a>, on June 20, 1996.

	China has always held a special fascination for Westerners. This vast, populous country is thought by many to have the oldest culture on Earth. Certainly it was the center of Eastern civilization. China was already a sophisticated society when Marco Polo traveled there in the 14th century, bringing back such treasures as silk, tea, spices, noodles, fireworks, exquisite porcelain, jade, and wood block printing.
<p>	But our captivation with China has not translated into a smooth and predictable relationship over the past few centuries. To us, China has been alternately open, then closed, and then reopened again. The result is that we Americans do not understand China very well--its ancient roots, its history, its people, its way of life, political structure, or place in today's world. Nor do the Chinese understand us. To them, the West has seemed imperialistic and exploitive, caught up with colonial designs on their territory and disrespectful of China as a great nation.
<p>	But it is imperative--even urgent--that we learn to understand each other better. I believe the U.S.-China relationship is one of the most important--perhaps the most important--of all the bilateral strategic relationships in the world today and that we have reached a defining moment in that relationship.
<p>
<b>China's Place in the World Today</b>
<p>	Today, China is a country in transition. Much change is occurring, and it is occurring at a phenomenal pace.
	<p>This was brought home to me forcefully when President Bush sent me to China in December of 1992 to normalize commercial relations that had been disrupted with the imposition of sanctions on China after the crackdown at Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989. I was the first Cabinet Secretary to visit the country officially since that sad day, and my mission removed one of the sanctions--the one prohibiting ministerial contacts between our two governments. Together, my then counterpart, Minister of Foreign Economics and Trade Li Lanqing (now Vice Premier), and I reconvened the nearly moribund Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade. In addition, $1 billion worth of new contracts for U.S. companies were signed, and much additional business followed.
<p>	During this trip, I saw firsthand the hunger of the Chinese for prosperity, their intense desire to move quickly into the ranks of the world's strongest economies, and the fervor with which they were applying themselves to achieving this goal. Since that trip in December of 1992, I have been back to China regularly. Each time, I am struck again by the rapid progress the Chinese are making toward this objective.
<p>	Of course, the path of dramatic change is never smooth; semi-controlled chaos might be one way to describe it. Nor is such change always clearly discernible to those outside the country. But the outcome in China has tremendous significance for us in the United States, for the whole of Asia, and indeed for the rest of the world. There are many reasons why.<ul>
	<p><li>China is an emerging great power. It is the world's most populous country--1.2 billion people.
	<p><li>It is strategically positioned as the geographic center of Asia. China shares a border with 14 different countries. It has more common borders than any other country in the world.
	<p><li>China has the world's largest standing army, and it holds one of the seven permanent seats on the United Nations Security Council. This means that China has a voice in-- and a veto over--the decisions made by this organization.
	<p><li>Finally--and most importantly, given my view of the world today that economic concerns are primary drivers of global politics--we now have China's growing economic clout. China's economy is the fastest-growing large economy in the world. The World Bank already ranks China as the third-largest economy in the world behind the United States and Japan. Predictions are that China's economy will grow somewhere between 8 and 10 percent this year, and economists expect China's economy to continue growing at least 6 to 8 percent annually for the foreseeable future. That means China is well on the way to becoming the world's largest economy within the next 15 years.
	<p><li>China is the largest market in the world for aircraft, for telephones, for construction equipment, for agricultural products, and increasingly for consumer goods. The country needs virtually everything we produce and sell. And demand is growing rapidly. In cities like Shenzhen in the south of China, the first of the Special Economic Zones created by Deng Xiaoping's reform drive, one can stand on the street corner and feel the dynamism and the energy as the Chinese people build another Hong Kong. The same can be said for Shanghai, reportedly sporting nearly 25 percent of the world's cranes, or Tianjin or Zhuhai. The whirlwind pace of growth and change is awe-inspiring.</ul><p>
	Now for the flip side.<p>
	Despite the dynamic economic growth, GDP per capita in China is only about $300. Some parts of China, especially in the north and the west, have not yet been touched by the freedom of the Special Economic Zones and are still very poor. In contrast, GDP per capita is much greater--probably far higher than $300--for people living along the coast and in the south of China, where the change has been the greatest.
<p>
<b>China--A Place of Contradictions</b><p>
	China today is, in some ways, hard to describe. Contradictions abound, starting with the government's self-description of the country as a "socialist market economy." Such contradictions pop up constantly as the leadership tries to put a Communist rationale and a Chinese face on activities that would make Karl Marx turn over in his grave.
	<p>China today is not a police state like Stalin's Russia; nor is there the indiscriminate violence and intolerance of the Cultural Revolution. But neither is it a democracy. There is a ruling elite in Beijing, but the central government is no longer as powerful as it once was. The provinces are flexing their muscles, and some officials are candid about wanting "Beijing off our backs." Besides the greater economic freedoms in China today, there is greater mobility, the beginnings of better job opportunities, greater tolerance for and interest in education, and greater freedom of discussion.
<p>	China is governed by a collective leadership in Beijing. Deng Xiaoping, the paramount leader, is still alive but not active in governing. His hand-picked successor, President and General Secretary Jiang Zemin, seems to have consolidated his power for the near term. But his word is not law; he must gain consensus among the others in the collective leadership. That is sometimes difficult and makes for erratic reactions, arrogant posturing, slow decisions, or no decisions on occasion.
<p>	Some people seem to believe that when Deng finally passes away there will be a great skirmish for power. I think not. I think the post-Deng era has already begun and that the collective leadership will stay in place at least for awhile.
<p>	One indicator of the course China may take in the near future will come within the next year to 18 months. Premier Li Peng is due to move out of the premiership, according to Party rules, and the Party Congress will choose his replacement. Who the Congress chooses could be an important signal. Much jockeying is going on now behind the scenes. From the U.S. perspective, the best choice would be someone committed to reform and familiar with the United States to replace the more nationalistic Li Peng.
<p>	Longer term, the real questions are: Will the Communist Party continue to enjoy legitimacy among the populace? Will it continue to satisfy the growing appetite for prosperity? Will there be another paramount leader, such as Deng and Mao? Or will China have opened up too much for one person to be able to command so much respect and power? And if there is no paramount leader, will a collective leadership survive? If not, what form will the leadership structure take, and how will the leadership be chosen? Or will China regress? Will there be a leadership change by force? What role might the military play?
<p>	History is little help to us here. Despite the tendency of China to have "paramount leaders" throughout its long civilization, the paradigm has changed significantly, thanks to the new economic freedoms, the march of technology, instantaneous communication globally, and a more closely integrated world.
<p>	Within China, the central government and the provinces are attempting to deal with myriad problems and issues. They are working now with the Ninth Five Year Plan. This one stresses a number of goals, including strengthening China's agriculture and bringing prosperity to the rural economy; creating infrastructure and building basic industries to address such needs as water conservation, greater energy production, and reliable communications; promoting science and technology; reforming state enterprises; expanding education; and moving toward a rule of law.
<p>	A big concern is the migration of people from rural areas to the cities in search of prosperity with the attendant possibility of social unrest. There are potential shortages of water and of oil. There is corruption. There is pollution. And these are just a few of the challenges and obstacles confronting China's leadership today.
<p>	What happens in China will bear close watching. I believe the drive to free the economy may well be irreversible. The Chinese people want prosperity and material things. They want to get rich. Political freedom and democracy seem not to be at the top of most people's agendas--prosperity is. Perhaps as material needs are better met, the Chinese people's desires will change. We will just have to see.
	<p>However, I believe that the U.S. posture toward China and the tone of the U.S.-China governmental relationship can have an influence on which way things go. It will also help determine whether China is an ally, a belligerent friend, or an enemy.
<p>
<b>The U.S.-China Relationship</b><p>
	Our relationship with China is anchored on three communiques, signed between 1972 and 1982, and the Taiwan Relations Act that was passed in 1979. The 1972 communique--the Shanghai Communique--was agreed to by President Richard Nixon and Chairman Mao Zedong. This was when the "one China" policy was first articulated. It has been the bedrock of the United States' diplomatic posture toward China ever since.
<p>	Currently, the relationship between our two governments is at the lowest point it has been in many years. It is characterized by distrust and misunderstanding on both sides. Let's just review what has happened since the Clinton Administration took over management of this critical relationship.
<p>	After charging President Bush with "coddling dictators" during the 1992 campaign, candidate Clinton changed his tune once he became President. Following an entertaining spectacle of dithering and public hand-wringing of the sort that has characterized this Administration, President Clinton adopted the very same "engagement" policy espoused by President Bush. Funny how one's perspective changes after one becomes the leader of the free world, isn't it?
<p>	The problem with President Clinton's change of heart and new policy began when the Administration didn't follow it. Three years later, the policy has become so muddled by ad hoc decisions and inconsistent actions that it is hard to ascertain what it is. And because of the mixed signals sent by Clinton and his Cabinet, many Chinese now have come to believe that our policy is the "containment" of China--an idea they deeply resent.
	<p>The big turnaround on President Clinton's part occurred during the 1994 annual battle over renewing most-favored-nation (MFN) status for China. The President announced that he would certify MFN renewal without the conditions regarding human rights that he had attached the preceding year. His decision was correct on the merits; trade and human rights should not be linked. Punishing trade does nothing to correct human rights abuses. But because the Administration made this decision unilaterally, without first gaining concessions on other trade issues from the Chinese, the policy change actually created confusion and caused the Chinese to think they had "won," that the Clinton Administration had backed down in the face of business pressure, and that they did not have to do anything else to satisfy the U.S. on trade. In fact, the Administration did give China a big victory--and got nothing in return.
<p>	Currently, from the Chinese perspective, the greatest obstacle to improving relations between our two countries probably is the question of Taiwan. One of the biggest flaps over this issue was sparked by something that to many here seemed rather unimportant--the granting of a visa to Lee Teng-hui, the President of Taiwan, in June of last year so that he could attend a reunion at Cornell University.
<p>	Again, this situation was badly handled. After promises had been made to China that such a visa would not be issued, President Clinton apparently changed his mind (what a surprise). He reversed this decision, thus pulling the rug out from under his own Secretary of State, who had made assurances to his counterpart, China's Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, that the visa would not be granted. Needless to say, Beijing reacted angrily and promptly recalled its ambassador. The decision to allow President Lee to visit the U.S. was interpreted by the Chinese as a violation of the spirit of the "one China" policy, and therefore an infringement on Chinese sovereignty. Sovereignty is a gut issue with the Chinese and has been ever since the "one China" policy was first articulated.
<p>	Another strain on the relationship was added earlier this year. Our country was incensed at the saber-rattling missile exercises and military maneuvers the Chinese  government carried out in the Taiwan Straits prior to the Taiwan elections. In response, the U.S. sent aircraft carriers to the region. Now, in the aftermath of the Taiwan election, tensions have been lowered, but some here in the United States are still distrustful of China's intentions toward Taiwan.
<p>Countless other examples could be cited to illustrate the inconsistency of U.S. policy, the mixed signals, and the escalating tensions which have characterized the Clinton Administration approach toward China. And although the two presidents have met on more than one occasion, they have not established anything that resembles a personal or a working relationship.
<p>
<b>Renewal of Most-Favored-Nation Trading Status-Again</b>
<p>	And now here we are again, debating the subject of most-favored-nation (MFN) renewal for China one more time. The annual discussion is under the Jackson-Vanik Amendment to the Trade Act of 1974. The amendment denies MFN to any "non-market" economy which restricts free emigration unless the President makes the determination to waive the restrictions. This amendment was aimed originally at the USSR during the Cold War era. But in recent years, since Tiananmen Square, the annual MFN debate has become the vehicle through which a variety of discontents with China have been raised. This year is no different, except that the number of issues with China has increased.
<p>	The President has certified to Congress his desire to renew MFN without conditions. Senator Dole, the presumed Republican presidential nominee, has stated his strong pro-MFN position. The Republican leadership in Congress agrees. Now the action is with Congress, which has 60 days to debate and vote. Congress should concur with renewing MFN for China. Denying it or attaching unrelated conditions makes no sense.<ul>
	<p><li>First, the economic consequences would be profound. Denial of MFN would impede trade, raise tariffs, and make it more costly to do business in China. At least 170,000 U.S. manufacturing jobs were directly dependent on U.S. exports to China last year, and thousands of others in such areas as transportation and finance are indirectly linked. Denying MFN would slow China's reform progress as well.
	<p><li>Second, such action would send a negative message to the Asia-Pacific region, a place where some countries already are concerned that the United States is planning to withdraw despite the fact that our presence is viewed as critical to ensuring stability in that part of the world.
	<p><li>Third, denial of MFN to China would harm the economies of Hong Kong and Taiwan, the two largest investors in the mainland--and both places in which we have a considerable stake.
	<p><li>Finally, denial of MFN will not correct or erase any of the concerns we have with China, whether they be human rights, nuclear proliferation, anti-Taiwan saber-rattling, or something else. Seeking to punish China through this vehicle simply does not serve our national interest.</ul><p>
	Furthermore, I think the time has come, before MFN renewal comes up again next year, to make MFN for China permanent. After all, we accord permanent MFN status to most other countries, including some considered rogue states, such as Iraq and Libya. Our strategic and economic relationship with the world's most populous country is too important to continue engaging in an annual mud-wrestling event around this issue. Doing this means changing or repealing the Jackson-Vanik Amendment, an action that should be high on the agenda of the President and Congress next year.
<p>
<b>Challenges</b><p>
	There are challenges to getting this done. Many people have serious and very real concerns about China.<ul>
	<p><li>First, the issue of human rights, which has cropped up every year since the crackdown at Tiananmen Square, raises everyone's sympathy and creates outrage among all of us who value personal liberty and freedom. All of us flinch at the reports about the detention of some dissidents, Chinese methods of population control, and allegedly poor treatment of children at orphanages. Needless to say, we disagree with the way in which China deals with many of these matters, but using trade as a weapon to try to force the Chinese into adopting more respect for human rights is not the way to make progress.
	<p><li>Second, nuclear proliferation looms as a major worry. Intelligence reports over the past few years--some apparently substantiated, some not--indicate that China has shipped missile technology and parts to Pakistan and Iran. Most recently, allegations that China shipped ring magnets to Pakistan caused some people to claim that China had violated the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1994. This act calls for mandatory sanctions once a finding of violation has been made. Specifically, this means that the U.S. Export-Import Bank could not make or guarantee any loans for projects in China. The Administration recently declined to make such a finding, in exchange for China's assurance that it would strictly observe its obligations under the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.
	<p>Once again, using trade as a weapon to address these concerns will not eliminate the problems. In addition, we have to question whether this sort of law punishes U.S. exports, and therefore U.S. jobs and well-being, more than it punishes the offending nation. This is a law which ought to be revised in the next Congress as well.
	<p><li>Third is the issue of intellectual property rights. A trade war was just averted on Monday by an 11th-hour finding by acting U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky that China had made substantial progress in complying with a 1995 agreement to protect intellectual property rights. The Administration had threatened sanctions if the Chinese did not take concrete steps to enforce the agreement; the Chinese had threatened to retaliate. So the good news is that we found that China had closed 15 factories that had been producing 30 to 50 million pirated CDs and videos yearly, shuttered six distribution centers, and instituted a ban on the importation of equipment needed to produce these products. The bad news is that this action does not solve the problem. It is a step in the right direction, but it is just a step and an incremental one at that. We are going to have to keep consistent pressure on the Chinese to continue making progress on the matter of safeguarding intellectual property rights until the rule of law is firmly established in China.
	<p><li>Fourth is another commercial dispute--our mounting trade deficit with China. The deficit, growing at nearly 20 percent annually in recent years, could reach nearly $40 billion this year. The worry is that China's market is still too closed and that U.S. jobs are disappearing to places around the world, like China, where labor is much cheaper.
	<p><li>Fifth is the question of Taiwan. Some Taiwan advocates want to punish China for the recent saber-rattling and for other things. Despite this--maybe even because of it--President Lee Teng-hui won handily, making Taiwan a shining example of economic freedom leading to political freedom. The United States does indeed have commitments to Taiwan, and we should honor them. But we need to be careful not to overstep and involve ourselves in the Beijing-Taipei debate when we have no reason to be there. It should be noted that the Independence Party candidate garnered barely 20 percent of the vote in the March election.
	<p><li>Then there is Hong Kong, which reverts to China on June 30 next year. How Beijing handles this situation will be viewed by many as a precursor to the way in which reunification with Taiwan, if it is to occur, would be handled. Already Beijing is making many people uneasy with such actions as announcing its intention to close down the Hong Kong Legislative Council and replace it with another body and issuing confusing statements about its intentions to respect freedom of the press in Hong Kong.
	<p><li>Finally, another strategic concern is the intentions of China's military. Some people also worry that U.S. products now sold in China could be diverted for military uses.</ul><p>
	Finding ways to deal with all of these very tough issues in a constructive manner is the challenge before us today.
	<p>One interesting obstacle to getting this done is posed by the fact that the majority of the American people are viewing China through an old stereotype. They either envision a Stalinist-type police state or think of peasants and water buffalo in rice paddies. Part of the challenge for those in China--and I believe there are many--who want to have a better relationship with the United States is to make Americans understand how China is changing and what the Chinese people want in their future.
<p>
<b>The Future</b><p>
	So where do we want our relationship with China to go from here? <p>
	Currently, the U.S. policy--or, more accurately, non-policy--is fraught with inconsistencies. This has led to confusion on the part of the Chinese about what we really mean. They, in turn, often behave in ways that we have difficulty understanding, and seem sometimes to be both arrogant and paranoid.
<p>	The business relationships, however, between the two countries are much more cordial and productive. That is good and it is hopeful.
<p>	However, the tension in the governmental relationship can and does negatively affect some commercial activity. Every time tensions increase, there are large projects which are held up. Some contracts U.S. firms hope to get go to other countries. The approval of licenses and branches, particularly in the financial services area, has slowed. All of this creates a climate of uncertainty and heightens the risk for American businesses.
<p>	There is one clear example of where Administration policy, which some think politically motivated in this election year, has hurt U.S. business prospects: the enormous Three Gorges Dam project, which the Chinese have been talking about for 50 years. Administration objections to this project on environmental grounds have caused the Export-Import Bank to announce that it will not help finance U.S. companies bidding on the project.
	<p>None of this helps our overall relationship with China. Therefore, it is incumbent upon the Administration to get its act together and make every effort to improve the bilateral relationship. The President and the executive branch must do it. Congress has a say, but Congress is not empowered or equipped to manage foreign relations day to day.
<p>	Engagement with China is the right policy. But the policy must be more than just words. Consistent actions speak far louder than words.
<p>	What we urgently need is a strategic framework for our relationship. This does not mean that we are going to be soft on China. It does mean that we have to define a clear set of goals, objectives, and expectations for our relationship and clearly articulate this to the Chinese. And they must have the opportunity to do the same. This is what has been missing from our relationship for the past three-and-a-half years. We must have a meaningful dialogue at the highest levels in order to push for what we want to achieve.
<p>	In putting this framework in place, we should concentrate first on areas where we have common interests and some agreement. The commercial sector is a good place to start.
	<p>Currently, thousands of U.S. companies are doing business in China. That number has increased significantly between my mission in 1992 and now. U.S. companies have about $26 billion invested in China, making the United States the third-largest investor after Hong Kong and Taiwan. Eighty percent of this investment was made since 1992. And, of course, the U.S. has considerable investment in Hong Kong as well--$12 billion at last count. In fact, the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong is the largest AmCham in the world.
<p>	The U.S. needs to work with the Chinese to bring about increased market access; to enforce intellectual property rights--a crucial issue for us; to reduce the overemphasis the Chinese government currently places on technology transfer and exporting by investor companies; and to help bring about a consistent rule of law.
<p>	The U.S. also needs to work with China to bring that country into the World Trade Organization (WTO) on reasonable terms. We need to help find a way around the current impasse: that China claims to be a developing country while we maintain she is not because of the clout associated with her sheer size. It is in our interest to have China join the WTO, on acceptable terms; that way, we could pursue our trade agenda multilaterally and would have added support for getting China to conform to the rules governing world trade.
<p>	Let me digress a moment and comment further on that. I think the Clinton Administration generally has been too unilateral in its approach to trade and often has been too knee-jerk confrontational in its style--a style which has not achieved results commensurate with its bluster. I suggest that we change our approach to trade negotiating. We should concentrate on a desired objective and then decide which tools and which negotiating style will best achieve the results we want. Talking tough to win political points at home is hardly a rational trade policy.
<p>	I also believe that the Chinese want a peaceful, stable world. Their primary objective right now is to industrialize and spread prosperity throughout their land. Wars and conflicts divert resources from this objective. Here is another area where I believe there is room for us to work with the Chinese, on non-proliferation concerns as well as on other strategic issues.
<p>	For other matters about which we have had disagreements in the past, we could look for items where we have a common interest and where we could agree. In those places where we cannot agree, we should still maintain a dialogue and make every effort to manage these problems.
<p>	Some predict the U.S. and China will become enemies over time. This is, of course, possible. But if it occurs, and I hope it does not, let us hope our policies--or lack thereof--do not contribute to such an outcome. Instead, our vision of the U.S.-China relationship ought to be rooted in making allies and friends of the Chinese. Withdrawing or doing nothing is simply not an option. An American presence is critical to maintaining a balance in Asia. Thus, the United States must remain engaged, both militarily and economically, in that part of the world.
<p>	We must keep in mind, too, that many in China are concerned about the deteriorating relationship with the U.S. Despite what we might think some days, the Chinese people admire America. They covet our products and much about our way of life. This is underscored by the fact that so many of them want to come here and send their children here to school.
<p>	Much work needs to be done to repair the U.S.-China relationship. The best way to promote progress is to stay engaged, to encourage China's economic reform and integration into the world community. To do this, we need to exercise the best diplomatic judgment and skills, to disagree with the Chinese when we must, be tough-minded when necessary, but do so in the context of fostering an important friendship. We need to encourage, cajole, and coax the Chinese forward instead of blustering, threatening, and shouting at them in public as the Clinton Administration has been doing. Above all, we need to treat our Chinese friends as we would any other friends: with dignity and fairness.
<p>	The road will not be easy. The Chinese, caught up in the process of great change, at times will be difficult. They will do things we do not agree with. We need to handle these matters in the context of our broader objective.
<p>	China has made astonishing progress in the past 17 years. If that progress toward economic reforms, prosperity, and a general opening up of the country continues for the next 17 years, China will indeed be perceived as a great power. The American people need to learn this. They must become better educated and more aware of what is going on in China today.
<p>	We cannot turn our back on the possibility of helping free markets and democracy along in China. If we are short-sighted and fail to adopt a long-term vision about our relationship, if we continue our current schizophrenic approach to China policy, who knows what direction change could take? The U.S. and the world cannot afford to take this risk.

<h3> ENTERING THE PACIFIC CENTURY</h3></p>
<p><b>By Senator Jesse Helms</b></p>
<p>
The Second Annual B.C. Lee Lecture, given March 26, 1996<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There are many great self-declared institutions in Washington. Some profess to have decided impacts on America's foreign policy. Then there are others truly making significant contributions; these are substantially fewer. <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Ed Feulner</a> and <a href="/heritage/staff/allen.htm">Richard Allen</a> are among the most significant players behind these few institutions -- but more about them in a moment.
<p>
<table border=0><tr><td><img src="lect562.gif" align=left width=277 height=196></td></tr><tr><td><font size="-1"><b>Heritage President Ed Feulner, center, introduces<br>
 Sen. Helms to Jay Lee, grandson of the late <br>
B.C. Lee, founder of the Samsung Group</td></tr></table><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Heritage Foundation was in its infancy in the early 1970s during my first years in the Senate. But it had by then already become "self-evident," as one of our greatest documents puts it, that Heritage was moving rapidly in its remarkable leadership with its advocacy of, and its support for, great principles that deserve to survive.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
History will appropriately record the enormously important role that Ed Feulner has played in restoring and preserving the meaning and the miracle of America. And Richard V. Allen, who is so highly respected in this city and far beyond, has made the difference on countless occasions and in countless matters when America's future was hanging in the balance. Richard Allen and Ed Feulner together founded the Asian Studies Center in 1983, and Mr. Allen has served as its chairman ever since.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I mention all of this in paying my respects to these two patriots, and to thank them, and you, for the honor of having been chosen to offer my remarks at this second annual B.C. Lee lecture for the Heritage Foundation. And let me also take just a moment to recognize in this distinguished company my good friend and colleague, Representative Benjamin Gilman, the Chairman of the House International Relations Committee.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The year 1983 didn't appear to have the rosy glow foretelling the dawn of the Pacific Century. Leonid Brezhnev had just died, the Soviet Union was in turmoil, and the United States was fighting the final battles of the Cold War. The Heritage Foundation was preoccupied with those and other pressing issues of the day, but it was also looking forward. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In 1983, as I have indicated, Heritage founded its Asian Studies Center, a reflection of its understanding of the vital role Asia was to play in the post-Cold War future. That forward-looking vision is the reason Heritage is today one of America's preeminent think tanks, a policy center on which I and many other Members of Congress rely.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In identifying the 21st century as the Pacific Century, I am merely stating the obvious: During the past decade, the world's center of gravity has shifted. And it will continue to move eastward away from Europe, toward Asia, because as the nations of Eastern Europe and the states of the former Soviet Union were struggling to break free of communism, Pacific Rim nations were busily taking care of business at home.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Their hard work has paid off. The Asia-Pacific region currently accounts for more than 40 percent of the world's trade and U.S.-Pacific Rim trade has out paced trade across the Atlantic. Thankfully for the United States -- though the political and economic center of gravity may have shifted West to East, Europe to Asia -- we remain uniquely positioned, not only geographically, but strategically, politically, and economically at the center. The United States thus remains the world's anchor.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
And that is where we must stay. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The fall of the Berlin Wall forced the United States to reexamine its role in the world. There were some who believed that the end of the Cold War was the time to turn inward, to spend a little time with our own problems. Others argued that the U.S. is the only country in the world with the moral, economic, and strategic strength to bring the rest of the world along. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I am convinced that we cannot be the best nation in the world unless we are willing to lead the world. We cannot lead by being the world's policeman, nor the world's babysitter, but by being what we have been for most of the 20th century -- the standard-bearer of moral, political, and military might and right, an example towards which all others aspire.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In Congress, U.S. alliances in the Pacific enjoy bipartisan support. Some of us focus on political alliances, others on economic, others on strategic, and still others on moral alliances. But all of us recognize that those alliances need strengthening. The question is how to prioritize our objectives.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But, first, what are our priorities?  Clearly, one reason the United States has seemed to be flailing around in the world, rushing from disaster to disaster, is because the Clinton Administration has failed to set priorities. Everything, from Burundi to Bosnia, is equally important -- and, therefore, equally unimportant. Our old allies in Europe are watching us and wondering with amazement where the United States is headed. And you can bet that our new allies in Asia are scratching their heads, too.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In just a few short years, the Clinton Administration has managed to warp U.S.-Asia policy so badly that, at any one time, the United States is at odds with China, Japan, and the Korean peninsula. Right now, many Asian nations fear that we are propelling ourselves down the road to irrelevance. And we're not just strolling either.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In China, the United States has neither a strategy, nor resolve, for dealing with areas of key interests to the United States On the Korean peninsula, this Administration has given lip service to our allies in South Korea while dealing directly with the North Koreans on issues ranging from their nuclear program to the delivery of humanitarian food aid. Food aid, for heaven's sakes, that North Korea demanded, while South Korea -- our friend and ally -- was insisting the North did not need.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
If this State Department, this National Security Council, and this White House, are determined to continue their experiments in foreign policy, let us pray that they will not make the devastating mistake of delegating decision-making to our enemies of forty years, the North Koreans.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The United States simply cannot afford to abdicate its role in the dominant region of the 21st century. We must have priorities, and we must stand up for them. And, yes, if and when necessary, fight for them.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Setting our priorities is no easy business. Asia presents daunting challenges. Consider the following:
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Communist China considers itself prepared to step into the role of a dominant world power, yet demonstrates time and again that it has neither the maturity nor the decency to handle the role;
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
North Korea maintains its million-man army and its militant, anti-Western propaganda machine while the United States props up North Korea's failing economy through a faulty agreement;
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Meanwhile Taiwan's dedication to democracy and capitalism deserves our continued support -- politically and militarily -- even in the face of severe opposition from Mainland China; 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Southeast Asians, proud of their continued economic miracles, are nervous about the Chinese military modernization and territorial claims in the South China Sea and are therefore pushing the ASEAN alliance into a strategic alliance, as well as an economic one; and
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
India and Pakistan, like two caged tigers, compete for nuclear weaponry and missile technology, all the while scratching at their wounds in Kashmir. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But China is the greatest challenge. China is still trying to figure out how to play its own role on the world stage. In the meantime, the United States cannot be hamstrung by China's confusion. The United States must not sit still in the thrall of an awakening dragon. We must define U.S. interests in Asia now, as the dragon awakes, and hope that the dragon will awaken on the right side of the bed.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Just three days ago, in Taiwan, the world watched as the free Taiwanese people cast their ballots in the first democratic presidential election ever in a Chinese-speaking country. President Lee Teng-hui scored a decisive victory in a hotly contested election. All of us, of course, congratulate President Lee and applaud his vision for Taiwan.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Think about it for a moment: In 1979, when the Carter Administration callously cut formal ties with our long-time ally, Taiwan, it was the Congress of the United States that compelled Mr. Carter to sign the Taiwan Relations Act -- the only law of the United States governing our relations with Taiwan. In passing the Taiwan Relations Act, Congress expressed its bipartisan support for Taiwan. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The election of President Ronald Reagan guaranteed that the Taiwan Relations Act would be properly enforced to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself against any external threat. At that time, most countries in the world ignored Taiwan. And, like some in the United States, these same people assumed it was only a matter of time before the Communists on the mainland consumed tiny Taiwan. That hasn't happened, and it will not happen as long as I am in the U.S. Senate.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
During the 1980s, the Reagan and Bush Administrations followed a consistent, principled policy toward Taiwan. It was not the least bit ambiguous. During this period, the people of Taiwan persisted. They accelerated the rate of growth in their free market economy, attracted high technology manufacturers, raised their own living standards, and encouraged the establishment of democracy. Even the most vigorous supporters of the Taiwanese -- myself included -- would never have thought that kind of progress possible in such a short period, especially given the fact that the Communists in Red China fought them the whole way.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
So where does Taiwan go from here?  Will the Communists continue to threaten and bluster, wielding their own military machine time and again against Taiwan?  Not if the United States plays the role it should.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
First of all, Taiwan deserves to participate in international organizations. Taiwan trades with the world, freely and fairly. Taiwan has a thriving, free market economy and a sound currency. Taiwan meets the fundamental criteria for membership in the World Trade Organization and should be admitted now, regardless of Mainland China's admission timetable. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Second, the United States must continue a vigorous and faithful implementation of the Taiwan Relations Act and all of its provisions. The United States has promised, and is obligated by law, to provide Taiwan with enough military equipment to defend itself against any external threat. The recent military exercises in the Taiwan Strait orchestrated by the Chinese Communists prove this to be more important than ever. We can and should -- we must -- remove any supposed barriers to providing Taiwan with state-of-the-art defensive systems and equipment. Taiwan threatens no one; the same cannot be said of Mainland China.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Third, we must actively engage other countries in the region to encourage and assist Taiwan's peaceful democratic growth. It will be Taiwan's economic growth upon which other economies in the region will come to rely. It is those countries that should be encouraged to support Taiwan on the political front as well. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Fourth, to ensure that we do not contradict our goal of encouraging Taiwan's economic growth in conditions of democracy, the United States must be exceptionally cautious concerning the technologies we sell to Communist China. The United States does not serve its own long-term interests well by augmenting Communist China's military capability.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
As for Mainland China, it has become an appalling habit in various U.S. administrations to speak to China as if to a child. We outline our expectations, and when they are not met -- and they are never met -- we make excuses. But the Chinese are not children, and we are not their parents. Respect for human life, willingness to obey international agreements -- these are U.S. priorities, not homework assignments. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Refusing to punish China when China does not live up to its commitments in the world only further encourages China's intransigence. Too often we don't follow through on sanctions because we worry that we will lose a share of the elusive Chinese market. But we are forgetting at least two things when we do that. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
First, the Chinese need us as much as, if not more than, we need them. Chinese growth and continued prosperity are dependent on a continued stream of foreign investment and trade. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Second, we forget the beloved Asian tradition of bargaining. If we explain our bottom line and then don't follow through to defend it, they'll push us to an even lower bottom line the next time around. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Twice recently, the United States has backed away from sanctioning China for its bad behavior. The United States, under the steady direction of Mickey Kantor, vowed to sanction China if it did not implement the agreement that China signed more than a year ago regarding intellectual property rights protection. Shockingly to nobody, except perhaps Mr. Kantor, the Chinese didn't live up to the terms of the agreement. But, you see, the Chinese know us too well. They dangled a $4 billion bid for Boeing planes in return for our not imposing the sanctions on intellectual property.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
More serious still than thieving brand-name sneakers are China's nefarious proliferation activities. In the face of China's transfer of strategically crucial missiles to one of the world's most destabilizing, terrorist nations, Iran, the Clinton Administration has sat on its hands. The Chinese play us well: They sign an agreement, violate it, and in return are awarded lucrative contracts with U.S. firms in which the U.S. firm is required to transfer important proprietary technology. What a deal.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
U.S. laws regarding sanctions for international trafficking in missiles and in weapons of mass destruction are clear. We disregard them at our own choosing -- and at our own peril.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The size of the Chinese market has blinded far too many to the Chinese threat. Military cadres in the Chinese leadership maintain a dominant role in the policymaking process. It is the generals, and not the apparatchiks, who enjoy a stranglehold over policy. It is they who have pushed China's drive to modernize its armed forces from a defensive, brown-water type to a blue-water force capable of forward deployment throughout Asia. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
By the end of the next decade, China will be capable of locking up the world's most strategic waterways. By reasserting its claims to atolls in the South China Sea and by selling billions of dollars in military hardware to the regime in Burma, while building shipping ports off the Burmese coast in the Indian Ocean, the Chinese are in a position to cut off the international right of free passage in those waters. One call from Beijing could very well cut off over 50 percent of the world's trade.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Japanese, the Koreans, the Southeast Asians, and the South Asians all see the trend and, in response, are begging the United States to maintain the 7th Fleet in the region. U.S. military presence in the region is vital. If we're willing to use U.S. armed forces to build toilets and sewers for Haitians, there is no question we should bolster U.S. forces to defend and maintain right of passage through these crucial international maritime routes. We not only would insure our own economic well-being, but also would maintain stability in markets throughout the world. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Clearly, the United States cannot shoulder the financial and logistical burden of defending Asia's waterways alone. In return for our services, the countries of the region are going to have to offer far more access and hospitality to our military.We will have to depend on our allies far more than we do now. Which brings me to the crucial role of the U.S.-Japan military alliance. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The United States and Japan, like it or not, share common goals and objectives for the Asia-Pacific. Our economies will come to depend upon the enormous economic growth in Asia -- a peaceful Asia, that is. The economic forces of an increasingly interdependent global economy and the strategic rise of China are hurtling the United States and Japan down the same path. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
If the United States is to attain its security objectives in Asia, the U.S.-Japan alliance must remain strong. However, our alliance with Japan has come under sharp scrutiny in recent months, and I am persuaded that the relationship must be reexamined -- not to determine whether it should continue, but how best it should continue.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
However, we must not fool ourselves. If the United States were to leave the Japanese to fend for themselves, I am convinced that Japan would go nuclear within ten years. It is entirely possible that within the course of the next century, the world may very well witness the development of a nuclear-armed Japan, a nuclear-armed and reunified Korean peninsula, a China with modern, forward-deployed armed forces, a still-divided and nuclear-armed South Asia and an arms race on a scale never seen before in Southeast Asia. That scenario is in nobody's best interest. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Japan must, however, do more. Japan must take responsibility in the world, not as a commercial buccaneer, but as a mature, responsible nation. We should be encouraging the Japanese to take a leadership role commensurate with Japan's economic standing. That means far more, for example, than affording Japan a seat on the U.N. Security Council to demonstrate its position in the world.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
It means that Japan will have to start making hard choices -- choices that may mean forgoing a market opportunity in a country in return for improvement in the standard of living for a nation's people. As yet, they have shied away from putting themselves on the line on some of the toughest policy issues like human rights and proliferation. It means that Japan maintains a strong enough economy that it should begin to use its influence not just toopen markets, but to leverage its power to affect change for the better in other countries. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
As Japan takes more responsibilities onto itself, I hope our trading relationship can flourish fairly. And on that note, I must tip my hat to Mickey Kantor. He has shown real gumption in pushing Japan with the threat of sanctions and retaliation in U.S. markets, all of which goes to show that not every fight needs to end in a war if the United States is willing to stand up to defend its national interests. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The South Koreans should be mindful in this regard, as well. A solid friendship underlies the U.S.-South Korean relationship. But if South Korea is to play a more significant role on the world stage, it, too, must become more considerate of, and receptive to, American goods and services. While the process of liberalization is underway, it should be accelerated.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The economic front is not the only front on which Asia will challenge U.S. policymakers. All sorts of strategic alignments and realignments are occurring throughout Asia. The United States has to keep abreast of these changes.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
One of the best prospects for a flashpoint in the region is the Korean peninsula. Along with 650,000 South Korean troops, 37,000 Americans face a million-man North Korean army poised along the border of North and South Korea, a little more than a marathon distance from Seoul. The results of the much-vaunted U.S.-North Korea Agreed Framework on the nuclear issue have yet to be seen, but one thing is clear: The Clinton Administration handled the North Korean regime with the same kid gloves it has heretofore used to handle all dictators from Castro to Aristide. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The United States has now agreed to supply hundreds of millions of dollars of oil to North Korea, enough oil to prop up the failing North Korean economy and thereby ensure that the Stalinist regime stays in power. That makes no sense. North Korea signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. It violated it. It should not get paid for that violation
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Saddest, perhaps, is that the world has learned only one valuable lesson from the vile activities of the North Koreans. The world has sadly learned that the United States can be blackmailed. When the going got tough, the United States has been willing to offer up the checkbooks of the American taxpayer. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Our great bargain with North Korea gives the North modern nuclear reactor technology that still allows them to produce plutonium for a nuclear weapon. The saving grace for the Clinton Administration?  The North Koreans won't be able to produce as much plutonium for nuclear weapons. And we are supposed to be relieved?  Give me a break.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Indeed, the Agreed Framework is so discredited with our allies that the tripartite international organization established to implement it can't beg or borrow enough to carry out its mandate. And why won't our allies ante up?  Because they're not sanguine about the deal that was struck.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
One of the central tenets of our compact with Pyongyang was that the North would begin a substantive dialogue with our allies, the South Koreans. It has not happened. The Administration has tried to convince the world that by offering the carrot of a nuclear reactor to the North, the rest of the world would benefit by having coaxed the North to talk with the South. It hasn't happened yet, and there doesn't seem to be any real movement in that direction. The real path to peace on the Korean peninsula runs directly from Seoul to Pyongyang -- not from Pyongyang to Washington. Dialogue between North and South Korea is one of the only chances the world has of seeing the Korean peninsula reunified on a peaceful, democratic, and economically solvent basis. That chance is disappearing as I speak.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
And now, if I may, let me turn to one of my old hobbyhorses, Russia. I am unaccustomed to regarding Russia as an Asian power, but the time has come to recognize that fully half of Russia's territory lies in Asia. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
For nearly a thousand years, Russia has been torn by competing European and Asian influences. I believe they prefer to consider themselves Europeans.But frankly, I don't particularly care how Russia sees itself -- just as long as it does so within its own borders. Which is, historically, the biggest problem with Russia: It finds its borders so confining.... 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Every so often, our friends in Moscow decide that they have neglected their Asian side. Unfortunately, their interest has tended to manifest itself in the shape of wars of expansion. At the beginning of this century, the Russian and Japanese Empires collided in a great naval battle at Port Arthur. In World War II, the Soviet Union seized a group of islands from Japan that are today held by Russia -- an act which continues to poison relations between the two countries. Under the leadership of Stalin and Mao, the Soviet Union and China experienced decades of friction, including periodic border clashes.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The challenge for Russia today is to overcome the legacy of military competition in the East and to build cooperative relations with its Asian neighbors. The question for us, however, is to what extent Russia chooses this course as an alternative to closer relations with the West.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Russia has indicated its interest in engaging Asia more closely -- witness President Yeltsin's widely touted trip to Beijing scheduled for early April. It is much repeated in Moscow that the "West" has not proven to be a gracious partner for Russia, and Russia therefore should look east. I will not dwell on the merit of Russia's criticism of the "West"; however, it is important that we all better understand what Russia seeks in engaging the East.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Closer ties between Russia and China are not automatically bad for U.S. interests. Those two nations share one of the longest land borders in the world. They certainly must, at a minimum, learn to coexist. However, if Russia seeks a closer relationship with the current regime in China as an alternative to the West, then Russia would defy its own interests.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Some in Russia today advocate following the "Chinese model" of market economics without political freedom. This is pure folly. I see no chance that the people of Russia would allow themselves to be led by a government such as China's, which so callously disregards the rights of its own citizens. If Russia seeks partners in Asia, it should instead look to those nations which have found the path to economic success and political freedom. That's the best mix of East and West.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
For real cooperation between Russia and China to succeed, it must be based on deeper interests than a momentary desire to unite against the West. I trust that responsible leaders in Russia know this to be true. I would not disregard the potential for the worst elements in the Russian and Chinese governments to try their very best to build such a relationship, but I doubt that they will succeed where Stalin and Mao failed.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Frankly, I have less fear of a Sino-Russian partnership than I do of Russia's and China's meddling in Asia. Which brings me to a trouble spot that doesn't usually come up in discussions of the so-called Pacific Century -- that is, South Asia. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Throughout the Cold War, India's own insularity allowed the United States the luxury of virtually ignoring the world's second largest nation. We no longer have that luxury for two reasons --  neither of them surprising to those of us who spend our time wrestling with the post-Cold War world.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In the past decade, India has become an economic power with which we all must reckon. Slowly, in its typical one step forward, ten steps backwards fashion, India is becoming an important player in the world economy. American companies are investing millions in India, and eyeing that nation's 200-plus-million middle class hungrily.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Unfortunately, as India becomes part of the world of fair-trading nations, India is also fighting to become a nuclear power. India exploded a nuclear device in 1974 and, until just a month or two ago, was on the verge of testing another. In addition, India has developed ballistic missiles and is moving quickly to produce them. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
India's leaders would have us believe that their drive for nuclear weapons and long-range missiles has to do with the odious Chinese threat to India's north, which is only partly true. Certainly, China has been no friend to India, and a good -- perhaps too good -- friend to Pakistan. But India's real problem is to its west, in Kashmir and in Pakistan. The vast majority of India's troops are concentrated on its Pakistani border and in Kashmir, and not on the Indo-Chinese border. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Pakistan, long a good and a true ally of the United States, is persuaded that India is bent on Pakistan's destruction. It's remedy has been to turn to the Safeway of proliferating nations -- China. Nuclear technology, missiles, arms of every kind are to be had for the asking over in Beijing. China, uniquely positioned to moderate the policies of its neighbors in South Asia, has instead used tensions in that region to profit on the deadly proliferation market. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
So how, ideally, does the United States respond?  Ideally, we look to one of the sources of the problem: Kashmir. We work with a portion of the vigor we have dedicated to Middle East peacemaking to forcefully persuade India and Pakistan to move to a settlement. Ideally, we slam China for fueling the South Asia arms race and demonstrate our own seriousness in fighting proliferation. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But then there is the real world. The Clinton Administration makes excuses for China. Mind bogglingly, we are told -- again -- that China did not fully comprehend its commitments under the Nonproliferation Treaty and, therefore, probably was not in the "wrong" in transferring missile technology to Pakistan. Pakistan is threatened with sanctions for buying missiles and nuclear technology, and rightly so. But when Prime Minister Bhutto begs for help in dealing with India, the Clinton Administration is not interested.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
India, happy to absorb $100-plus-million in U.S. foreign aid every year, laughs in our faces when we demand that they work with us against proliferation. And at any hint that the United States might get serious, legions of companies are brought in to describe to us the importance of continuing to do business with India. After all, the Indians may not like China, but they sure have learned a thing or two from Beijing about how to manipulate Washington, D.C.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Well, now, I have spent much of my time talking about the 800-pound gorillas of Asia. Now let's talk a bit about the tigers.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The economies of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are booming. Over the past five years, they have averaged 7 percent growth, a trend that promises to continue for at least the next few decades. The ASEAN story is a genuine success story. Consider that a group of nations with disparate histories, languages, and economies joined together to ensure stability in the region. They recognized early on that they could provide commensurate counterweight to the economic and strategic forces of China, Japan, and the Korean peninsula only if they were united. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Developing strong ties with each of the members of ASEAN will be another linchpin in the U.S. approach to Asia. We must work -- and work harder -- with our close friends in ASEAN to encourage them to bring pressure for reform to bear on countries like Vietnam, Laos, and Burma --  - countries where repressive governments have still not adopted the rule of law or accepted the international norms for the treatment of human rights.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
For Burma and Laos, the lure of ASEAN membership is a significant enough draw to encourage these countries actually to consider liberalization. The question will be whether the current ASEAN countries make that issue a priority. Without encouragement and even pressure from the United States, they will not do so. That would be a serious mistake -- though only one more in a series of mistakes in Asia for this administration. The United States cannot afford to let this ball drop. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Somehow the Clinton Administration approach to U.S.-Asia policy reminds me of Alice in Wonderland -- if you don't know where you're going, any road will get you there. The United States today is in the position, economically and militarily, to be the dominant friendly power in the Asia-Pacific. We can't afford to squander that position in the run-up to the Pacific Century. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There's no crystal ball telling us how the world will unfold, but I am confident of Asia's central part in that world. There is a famous Chinese proverb that says something along the lines of: "If the water is murky, just wait and let it settle. Then it will all be clear to you."  The future of the region and the U.S. position there is murky now, but we cannot sit and wait for the waters to clear before we define our policies. 

<p>U.S. policy must directly address U.S. interests in Asia. There are at least five points for us to stress:</p>

<p>(1) Maintain open and peaceful shipping waters for trade; </p>

<p>(2) Maintain a strategic balance between China, Japan, the Korean peninsula, and Southeast Asia, all the while preventing a cataclysmic arms race; </p>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	With passage of the historic Telecommunications Act of 1996 earlier this year, many in Congress, the media, and the public have been led to believe that the long-awaited task of communications deregulation has been completed. Nothing could be further from the truth.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	While the new Telecommunications Act takes some important steps toward market liberalization, they are in many cases tiny steps. Furthermore, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which is charged with the task of implementing the Act, already has shown itself eager to exploit the vague rhetoric and loopholes found in many sections of the Act by expanding rather than rolling back regulations. Worse still, some of the recent FCC proceedings and rule-makings undertaken supposedly to comply with this legislation are so complex, notes investment analyst Susan A. Lynner of Prudential Securities, that, "If the devil is in the details, then we must be in hell."<sup>1</sup>  In many ways, these problems can be traced to poorly worded or open-ended sections and clauses found in the original legislative language of the Telecommunications Act. <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;		 But the more serious problem with the Telecommunications Act is not what it includes, but what it does not include. The statute almost completely ignores the segment of the communications marketplace that is experiencing the most innovation and entrepreneurship -- the wireless sector. The legislation focuses primarily on wireline issues (local telephony and cable in particular). Wireless industries that currently use the electromagnetic wireless spectrum<sup>2</sup> (such as cellular or broadcasting), as well as other businesses that hope to enter the wireless market, do not receive comparable attention.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;		Realizing this, Senator Larry Pressler (R-SD) has circulated a staff discussion draft, "The Electromagnetic Spectrum Management Policy Reform and Privatization Act," as the prelude to possible legislation. Senator Pressler is Chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee. The proposal is sweeping in its scope and, if implemented, would force a complete overhaul of wireless spectrum regulatory policy. Among its beneficial steps, Senator Pressler's proposal:<ul>

<li><b>Provides spectrum flexibility.</b> The proposal would end seven decades of spectrum mismanagement and industrial policy by allowing spectrum holders to use their spectrum for whatever purpose they wish. No longer would the FCC be allowed to "zone" the spectrum in discrete parcels and place restrictions on its use.
<p>
<li><b>Expands and makes permanent the auction and allocation process.</b> The FCC's extremely successful experiment with spectrum auctions would be expanded and made permanent for new uses of spectrum.
<p>
<li><b>Creates a second-best broadcaster spectrum auction solution.</b> Although the Pressler proposal backs away from the contentious issue of auctioning off licenses already set to be given away to the broadcast television industry, it does create a favorable alternative. Broadcasters would be forced to pay a deposit for receipt of new digital licenses, and this deposit would be fully refundable when they turn in their old analog license after a 15-year transition period. Alternatively, if broadcasters did not wish to pay the deposit, they could opt to keep their current analog license forever and forgo the opportunity to obtain a new digital license. If they chose this second option, the leftover spectrum would be auctioned to other users.
<p>
<li><b>Prohibits FCC spectrum standard-setting or construction mandates.</b> The Pressler plan wisely mandates that the FCC could not engage in technical standard-setting because the staggering pace of technological change in this industry will likely make any standard irrelevant in the near future. Furthermore, the bill would prohibit the FCC from micromanaging construction specifications and timetables of new spectrum networks.
<p>
<li><b>Demands release of more publicly held spectrum and more efficient public use of spectrum:</b> In an important step, the Pressler plan demands that federal agencies reallocate large portions of inefficiently used government spectrum to private use. Furthermore, the spectrum that remains in government hands would have to be used more efficiently.
<p>
<li><b>Transfers all spectrum responsibilities from the NTIA to the FCC and block grants public safety spectrum to the states.</b> The proposal also would eliminate needless spectrum management duplication by transferring all spectrum authority currently held by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) to the FCC. In addition, the bill would block grant public safety spectrum back to the states so they can control locally all spectrum needed for police, fire, and other safety uses.
<p>
<li><b>Requires a spectrum report.</b> Finally, the plan would mandate a review of the effects of the bill two years after implementation and require the FCC to suggest further deregulatory initiatives that can be undertaken.</ul>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The Pressler plan, if enacted into law, would represent the most important privatization effort undertaken by the federal government in recent years. This would spur job and export creation in this highly innovative American industry. Failure to implement these reforms, on the other hand, would mean that Congress's efforts to revolutionize the communications industry would remain limited and incomplete. 
<p>

<b>WHY REFORM IS NEEDED</b>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Senator Pressler's spectrum reform and privatization plan is vital for several reasons. The current system of spectrum management is roundly criticized because:<ul>
<li><b>It is resistant to change and innovation.</b> Currently, federal spectrum regulators are allowed to decide who may use spectrum, where they may use it, how long they may use it, and most important, to what use they may put their spectrum. This is often referred to as "spectrum zoning," to borrow a real estate land management metaphor. Not surprisingly, this zoning leads to massive misallocations and misuses of spectrum. Once a certain technology is locked into place, it can take years before another use of that spectrum is allowed; thus, both innovation and entrepreneurial activity are discouraged by this technological industrial policy. 
<p>
<li><b>It imposes large costs of delay.</b> Not surprisingly, this resistance to change and innovation results in enormous costs. These costs can be measured either in terms of the number of new products offered to consumers or in terms of the overall loss of economic activity to the economy. The costs are high. For example, even though spectrum was reallocated in 1970 to make room for cellular services, the first experimental license was not granted by the FCC until 1977, and other commercial licenses were not granted until the early 1980s. Economists Jeffrey H. Rohlfs, Charles L. Jackson, and Tracey E. Kelly have argued that "had the FCC proceeded directly to licensing from its 1970 allocation decision, cellular licenses could have been granted as early as 1972 and systems could have become operational in 1973, a decade earlier than they were in reality."<sup>3</sup>  As a result, they estimate, this regulatory delay cost the U.S. economy $86 billion, or 2 percent of gross national product (GNP) in 1983, when cellular licensing finally began.<sup>4</sup>
<p>
<li><b>It is open to special interest influence and discourages competition.</b> With such a tight hold on the spectrum reins, regulators can steer the industry in almost any direction they desire. Worse yet, because communications regulation often has resembled a "good old boy" network -- with favored industry groups working hand-in-hand with regulators to craft policy -- competition has been discouraged. 

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
For example, for many years the broadcast industry worked with the FCC to restrict the rise of cable television, since it posed an obvious threat to the unchallenged hegemony of the broadcast industry. As telecommunications scholars Michael K. Kellogg, John Thorne, and Peter W. Huber note, "For many years the FCC's principal objective was to suppress the cable industry by preventing direct competition between cable and over-the-air broadcasting. It did so quite successfully.... "<sup>5</sup> This regulatory setback delayed the onset of video competition for over a decade.<sup>6</sup>  Despite no clear explanation of how this served the public, the FCC continued to implement these anti-competitive policies, even though it had received no explicit grant of congressional authority to do so.<sup>7</sup><p><li><b>There is a lack of respect for First Amendment rights.</b> Finally, the current system of spectrum management provides regulators with the ability to influence directly the content and composition of specific types of programming, and to threaten firms with discontinuation of the right to operate if they fail to comply with regulatory edicts. For example, the FCC currently uses the Children's Television Act of 1990 as a tool for blatant regulatory extortion. The FCC has gone beyond the admittedly vague statutory language of the Act to demand specific quantitative minimum numbers of hours of children's programming in exchange for allowing business other freedoms.<sup>8</sup>  For example, after CBS and Westinghouse recently announced their intention to merge, FCC regulators (who have the power to block such alliances) forced the companies to promise that certain quantitative programming requirements would be honored as a condition of merger approval. Several other firms have faced similar threats from the FCC as a condition of normal business operation. 	<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  Even though such regulatory blackmail would represent a clear First Amendment violation if applied in the print realm (fo
r example to newspapers or magazines), it is considered normal operating procedure in the realm of electronic communication (radio or television broadcasters).
</ul><p>


<b>WHAT THE PRESSLER PLAN WOULD DO</b>

	<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Fortunately, the Pressler plan would correct most of these flaws within the current system. Specifically, the proposal:<ul>

<li><b>Provides spectrum flexibility.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The Pressler proposal would end seven decades of misguided and inefficient spectrum management, allowing spectrum users to use their licenses to provide any service in any way they desire as long as it does not interfere with another spectrum user or violate any U.S. treaty obligations with other nations regarding international spectrum use. It also would allow spectrum users to transfer their flexible spectrum freely to others on the open market. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	 This would mean the death of federal spectrum industrial policies because it would prohibit any further "zoning" of spectrum. This could encourage a "spectrum renaissance," as many entrepreneurial ideas that could not be acted upon in the past due to spectrum operating restrictions could now be implemented. Countless innovations and new job opportunities would spring from a wireless marketplace freed from its regulatory shackles.
<p>
<li><b>Expands and makes permanent the auction and allocation process.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The Pressler plan would expand and make permanent the extraordinarily successful system of spectrum auctioning that Congress originally authorized in 1993. Tens of billions of dollars have been generated for the U.S. Treasury and an enormous amount of innovation already has taken place, thanks to the auctioning process. In fact, an entirely new industry, the personal communications service sector (PCS), a more advanced system of wireless cellular communication, has been created as a result of the auction process. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	 Unfortunately, Congress limited the applicability and time of auctions in 1993. The Pressler proposal would mandate that only auctions be used in the future and any potential "mutually exclusive use" of the spectrum (when two or more parties vie for the same spectrum allocation) must be thrown open to competitive bidding at an auction. There would be four notable exemptions, however, to this general rule. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
		 <b>First</b>, any spectrum request that is "non-mutually exclusive" (only one party requests the spectrum), obviously would not be open to an auction. This spectrum would simply be given to the party requesting it. The FCC could demand, however, that these users pay user fees to the government to ensure that the spectrum is not hoarded or used inefficiently.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
		<b>Second</b>, public safety users of spectrum would be exempted. These spectrum uses would include such things as police and fire stations that need to communicate over the radio spectrum, as well as Department of Defense military applications. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
		 <b>Third</b>, spectrum required for global satellite orbital assignments would not be auctioned since this would create international difficulties with other countries that possess different spectrum assignment mechanisms. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
		 <b>Fourth</b>, while it is reasonable to exempt the previous three uses and users from spectrum auctions, the following exemption reflects the raw political power of an industry rather than good policy. 
<p>

<li><b>Creates a second-best broadcaster spectrum auction solution.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The Pressler proposal would exempt from auction the licenses set to be given away to broadcasters for the provision of digital television. This is unfortunate, because $10 billion to $70 billion worth of spectrum would be lost if such a giveaway to the broadcast industry were allowed to go forward. Worse yet, it would single out one segment of the industry for special treatment in a time when everyone else in the industry is being forced to spend billions bidding at competitive auctions to obtain the additional spectrum they need or desire to conduct business.<sup>9</sup>  Political pressure from the broadcast lobby has led many in Congress to abandon any hope of auctioning this spectrum.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Yet the Pressler plan would create a second-best solution, referred to as the "deposit, return and overlay approach."  Basically, every television broadcast licensee in America would be able to choose between one of the following two plans: 
<p>
	 <b>Option #1:</b> A broadcaster could obtain an additional license directly from the government instead of through a competitive auction, but pay periodic fees or deposits into an escrow account. The fees collected from broadcasters would be based on the value of similar licenses sold in "overlay" auctions. Overlay refers to the technological capability to use certain portions of the spectrum simultaneously for multiple uses. Spectrum adjoining that which would be given to broadcasters therefore could be auctioned off, and its auction price would then be used to determine the amount of the fee or deposit broadcasters would be forced to pay for exclusive use of the additional spectrum.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
During the 15-year transition period when broadcasters each would possess two licenses (one analog, one digital), accrued interest on the spectrum deposit account would be placed in the U.S. Treasury to pay for tax cuts or deficit reduction. After the 15-year transition period ended, broadcasters could relinquish their older analog license and receive their deposit back from the government (less the accrued interest that went into the Treasury). For every year the broadcasters held their old license in excess of the 15-year cutoff date, they would lose 20 percent of their overall deposit; after five years, in other words, they would lose the full value of their deposit if they did not return the old license.

<p><b>Option #2:</b> Broadcasters could bypass the opportunity to obtain a second license directly from the government and instead opt to keep their older analog license perpetually. No spectrum fees or deposits would be owed by those who chose this option. The spectrum relinquished in this manner would then be auctioned by the FCC. Overall auctions would still take place, however. 

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	 This "deposit, return and overlay" approach is a good second-best alternative to straightforward auctions because it would provide a method of compensation for the use of spectrum and, would not allow broadcasters to keep two licenses without incurring serious costs.
<p>
<li><b>Prohibits FCC spectrum standard-setting or construction mandates.</b>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The Pressler proposal would explicitly prohibit the FCC from imposing a digital television standard on the American marketplace. It simultaneously would avoid any compatibility or construction requirements that could lead to the adoption of yet another misguided industrial policy. 

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	 Unfortunately, the FCC in May did adopt a standard for digital television, largely to appease electronics manufacturers that wanted to lock in the technological system they favor. Although the Advanced Television Systems Committee (ATSC) Digital Standard that was adopted allows television broadcasters flexible use of their spectrum, many other potential spectrum users, especially innovative computer companies such as Microsoft Corporation and Apple Computer, objected to the standard for various technological reasons. 

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	 Surprisingly, the ATSC standard was adopted despite the warnings of FCC Chairman Reed Hundt, who questioned whether the agency was in the best position to set such a standard during a period of rapid innovation. In a statement, Hundt asked, "Why is it in the public interest to adopt rules freezing the current state of technology?  Given the rapid pace of technological change, isn't it inevitable that there will be innovations that even the flexible ATSC Standard cannot accommodate?"<sup>10</sup>  Even more important, "Shouldn't we be concerned that erecting a regulatory barrier to the use of new technologies may discourage the research and development necessary for innovation?"  Hundt went on to ask, "How is it consistent with the deregulatory spirit of the new Telecommunications Act to codify (directly or indirectly) the 200-plus pages of technical details that constitute the ATSC Standard?"<sup>11</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	There are no easy or good answers to Chairman Hundt's questions because there is no legitimate reason for the FCC to be in the business of technological standard-setting in the first place. The FCC has a long and checkered history of experience with television standards. As a Progress and Freedom Foundation telecommunications working group report notes, "The modern television was exhibited by RCA in 1939, but the FCC took years to adopt initial standards. The FCC then froze all applications for TV licenses until 1952. In the year after the freeze was ended, the number of stations tripled. However, a 1952 FCC decision deliberately limited the number of viable stations per market, and impeded the creation of additional TV networks, at enormous costs to the American viewing public."<sup>12</sup>  With this history and a healthy respect for the pace of technological change in mind, the Pressler plan would prohibit standard-setting at the FCC.
<p>
<li><b>Demands release of more publicly held spectrum and more efficient public use of spectrum.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The Pressler proposal would mandate that, beginning next year, 25 percent of the spectrum the federal government currently owns exclusively or shares with the private sector below a certain frequency (5 GHz) shall be re-allocated for private sector auctions. Beyond this 25 percent of publicly held spectrum found under 5 GHz, the Pressler plan would require that the President appoint a seven-member "Advisory Committee on Withdrawal" to determine the amount of additional public spectrum that could be transferred to the private sector over a ten-year period.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	More important, the Pressler plan would initiate a financial incentive program to encourage government spectrum users to surrender portions of their spectrum voluntarily for private auctions. For example, if the Department of Transportation or Department of Defense realized they were stockpiling large portions of spectrum that were not being utilized, under the Pressler proposal they could turn in the spectrum for private auction and then receive a cut of the auction proceeds (which could be used for employee bonuses). This would be an important incentive for federal agencies that are hoarding spectrum inefficiently to transfer that spectrum to more efficient and profitable uses and users.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The Pressler proposal also would require that, to the maximum extent possible, federal spectrum users rely on the private sector to supply them with radio communications equipment. Competitive bidding also would be required for all new federal government procurement of radio communications systems. Finally, the proposal would mandate that federal agencies work together with private sector firms to utilize more advanced and efficient digital services that would then open up more spectrum for use. Once a government agency and a private sector firm had installed the new digital technologies and created new spectrum capacity, the agency and the firm could divide the spectrum for other uses. The President would have the ability, however, to veto any FCC action related to public spectrum use that was deemed harmful to national security or public safety.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The Pressler plan also would place public spectrum users on equal footing with private users in terms of spectrum flexibility. Government spectrum users would be able to transfer their spectrum to any other public or private entity and receive compensation. 

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;		 In addition, the plan would likely raise significant revenues for deficit reduction or taxpayer relief. 	 
<p>
<li><b>Transfers all spectrum responsibilities from the NTIA to the FCC and block grants public safety spectrum to the states.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The Pressler plan would end needless duplication of spectrum management responsibilities by consolidating all authority within the FCC. Currently, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) manages the publicly held spectrum, while the FCC manages all private spectrum. Upon implementation of the plan, all NTIA functions would be transferred to the FCC, and the NTIA, now part of the Department of Commerce, could be closed down.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The Pressler proposal also would "block grant" authority over public safety spectrum back to the states. In essence, those portions of the spectrum required by state and local public safety users (police and fire stations) would be managed by the states. Any interference issues that arose would be adjudicated by the FCC. 
<p>
<li><b>Requires a spectrum report to monitor progress.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The Pressler proposal would require that the FCC prepare a spectrum report summarizing the progress and results of this deregulatory effort. This would include both a cost-benefit analysis of the measure and additional legislative recommendations from the FCC to further the process of spectrum reform. </ul>
<p>


<b>HOW THE PRESSLER PLAN COULD BE IMPROVED</b>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Even though the Pressler discussion draft marks a significant and beneficial step in the right direction, it could be improved. Additional reforms that should be undertaken and policy clarifications that are needed include:<ul>

<li><b>Hold outright, unambiguous auctions for all spectrum uses and users.</b>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Although the Pressler proposal would create a sensible second-best solution to the broadcast spectrum dilemma, it is still preferable to apply auctions equally to all spectrum uses and users. It simply makes no sense to carve out special exemptions for certain industries while Congress is attempting to craft more pro-competitive, anti-monopolistic telecommunications policies. Many policymakers argue that the special "social compact" the public has with the broadcast industry justifies giving broadcasters special non-auction status, with government furnishing private broadcasters with free licenses in exchange for universal, high-quality informational and entertainment service.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;		But by almost any measure, broadcasters have not lived up to their end of the bargain. Broadcasters, in fact have served the public poorly, primarily because they have not faced stiff competition for viewer allegiance until recent years. Hence, they have felt little pressure to improve the quality of their programming.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;		Congress should end this failed social compact with broadcasters and demand that they enter the competitive age of communications on the same basis as all others in the industry. The Pressler plan could be improved markedly by making sure that such uncompetitive favoritism is ended once and for all.
<p>
<li><b>De-license the entire spectrum.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	While providing complete flexibility in use is an important and long-needed step toward a free market in spectrum, the Pressler plan fails to take the final step needed to ensure that spectrum socialism is ended forever. Congress needs to eliminate all spectrum licensing requirements and provide current license holders full property rights to their spectrum allocation. This would ensure that all bureaucratic spectrum meddling ends and that a truly free market reigns in the wireless realm, as it does in real estate markets where private property rights have worked so well for centuries. 

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	 This does not mean anarchy would be or should be allowed to exist in wireless spectrum markets. Government would still have an important role in enforcing property rights in spectrum. For example, interference and trespass issues would still need to be adjudicated and resolved by independent third parties. This does not mean, however, that only the FCC is suited to carry out this task. In fact, enforcing property rights in spectrum should be easier than enforcing them in land since fewer "externality" concerns exist. For example, while river and air pollution present special problems in the enforcement of land property rights, no comparable externalities exist in the wireless spectrum. Private spectrum coordination organizations (which already exist), the courts, or a federal administrative body much smaller than the FCC could carry out any straightforward dispute resolution concerns that remain.
<p>
<li><b>End "public interest standard" regulation and guarantee equal First Amendment protections for all media, whether print or electronic.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	At the heart of everything that is wrong with modern communications law lies the "public interest standard."  This standard, which has governed communications policy at the FCC for almost seven decades, has never been defined. In effect, therefore, is a non-standard; it has no fixed meaning. Its vagueness has been used by federal regulators to destroy competition, to threaten the livelihood of existing businesses, and, most important, evade First Amendment restrictions -- all in the name of protecting the public.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The Pressler proposal, like the Telecommunications Act which preceded it, would do nothing to define this open-ended regulatory standard or minimize its uncompetitive effect on the wireless marketplace. Bureaucrats would continue to be able to diminish competitive opportunities and run roughshod over the First Amendment rights of spectrum users. This makes increasingly less sense as wireless electronic technologies (which are accorded only secondary First Amendment protections) subsume the more traditional print media (which are accorded strict First Amendment rights). If Congress does not define this standard clearly, the FCC conceivably could decide to regulate the content of The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal merely because these and other newspapers and magazines are delivered over an electronic medium the agency is able to regulate under the public interest standard. Congress would find it difficult to explain to the public (not to mention the editors of these private and traditionally unregulated newspapers) just why regulation is needed merely because the public receives these dailies over computer screens instead of on paper.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	In short, the public interest standard may serve the interests of regulators and the special interests that benefit from its uncompetitive edicts, but it does not serve the consuming public. It should be clear that policymakers can choose regulation under the public interest standard or they can choose free competition -- but they cannot choose both. Cutting the spectrum loose from its 70-year-old regulatory shackles is the best way to serve the public interest.
<p>
<li><b>End protectionist policies that restrict beneficial foreign investment in spectrum technologies and companies, and combine this with privatization of international satellite organizations.</b> 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Under Section 310(b) of the Communications Act of 1934, foreign companies may not own a radio communications license and may not own more than 20 percent of the shares of a company that holds a radio communications license. This protectionist restriction has outlived its usefulness. While national security concerns may have served as a valid justification for prohibiting foreign investment in the past, this policy no longer makes sense. 

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
		 Restricting foreign investment in spectrum technologies and firms cuts off the flow of beneficial capital and expertise. Just as free trade in other sectors has benefited the American economy and improved the nation's competitiveness, openness to free trade in communications goods and services will best serve the interests of American firms and consumers.<sup>13</sup> <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;		 While an effort was made during committee debate over the Telecommunications Act to include language eliminating or at least curtailing the effect of Section 310(b), such language was not included in the final conference bill. The Pressler proposal could correct this mistake by repealing Section 310(b) and all other telecommunications spectrum protectionism once and for all.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Also, to promote international trade in telecommunications, the Pressler plan could take steps to begin breaking down the global monopolies held by international satellite organizations such as Inmarsat and Intelsat. These organizations are international consortia of various signatory countries that have long held a strong grip over access to international satellite service. Comsat is the U.S. representative to Inmarsat (which provides mobile and maritime satellite services) and Intelsat (which provides global television and telephone services). Now that viable private satellite carriers exist that can provide international communications services more efficiently, these organizations should be privatized and all special privileges they receive should be revoked to encourage a more competitive marketplace.
<p></ul>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>

<p>

	While the Pressler spectrum privatization proposal is not perfect, it represents the boldest and most principled deregulatory initiative in the field of communications to date. In comparison to the initial drafts of the Telecommunications Act, which pre-emptively compromised on key policy issues, Senator Pressler's initial spectrum effort represents near flawless deregulatory legislation. 

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
		 If Congress fails to pursue this unique spectrum liberalization effort, it will be forgoing the most important privatization opportunity in years -- perhaps in this century. Countless new innovations would flow from the creation of a free market in spectrum. This innovation and entrepreneurship would create untold numbers of new job and export opportunities. In short, the Pressler spectrum privatization plan would revolutionize the communications industry and provide a much-needed boost to the American economy.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Since the early 1930s, no sector of the American economy has been more heavily regulated than the financial services industry, and particularly commercial banks. Addressing an industry conference, Jerry L. Jordan, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, summed up the extent of banking regulations by noting that 
<blockquote>

For more than 60 years, the Glass-Steagall Act has defined what a banking organization has been allowed to do; the Douglas and other bank holding company acts have defined the corporate form required to do it; the national or state banking authorities, deposit insurance agencies, and Federal Reserve have defined how to do it; and their supervisors and examiners have made sure it was done that way. It's a tribute to the perennial optimism of human beings that a conference on the future of banking might talk about anything other than <I>regulation</I>.<sup>1</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Indeed, it is difficult to speak of banking or any other financial service without also mentioning the overwhelming amount of federal regulation that affects the industry. 

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;At the heart of this regulatory web is the Banking Act of 1933, commonly known as the Glass-Steagall Act. Glass-Steagall established barriers between commercial banks and their investment counterparts. It also established barriers between banks and other commercial businesses so that today, a bank that offers loans and checking accounts cannot also directly underwrite securities for its business customers or offer life insurance policies to its consumers. This theory of "separation banking" continued to drive federal regulation for 60 years. Each time the market established a legal connection between banking and another financial or commercial sector, the government stepped in with new regulations preventing such a relationship. 

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; As a result of legal restrictions, banks have seen their share of the financial services sector slip away to less-regulated competitors. In fact, between 1952 and 1994, banks, thrifts, and credit unions saw their share of the financial sector fall from 67.4 percent to 35.5 percent,<sup>2</sup> largely because banks are prohibited from taking advantage of innovative investment opportunities and offering modern financial options to their customers. In essence, banks are asked to compete in the technologically advanced 1990s using only 1930s investment techniques. 

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Consumers suffer substantial harm from the forced separation of financial services. Every producer and consumer in the United States is connected in some way to the financial services industry, be it through a simple $100 checking account or by means of a complex, multibillion-dollar corporate merger. Nearly every economic transaction -- millions of them each day -- involves the exchange of money or the promise of a future exchange of money, so every producer and consumer in the country feels the weight of financial service regulations daily. And every day, producers and consumers pay an unnecessary premium for this burdensome system of regulation.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It is impossible to repair a system as broken as the federal financial regulatory system.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Congress and the President should allow financial services to be provided within a free market by eliminating the many regulations that currently interfere with efficient transactions and savings. The first step in this process is elimination of the artificial barriers that have been created between commercial and investment banking and all other commercial and financial activities.<sup>3</sup>  Specifically, Congress and the President should:<ul><p><li>

Repeal the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, which prohibits umbrella bank holding companies from owning diverse financial businesses, and the 1970 amendments that expand these restrictions to commercial businesses;

<p><li>Repeal the Banking Act of 1933 (the Glass-Steagall Act), which prohibits financial service companies from offering a full range of financial and commercial services;

<p><li>Eliminate all federal regulatory barriers to integrated financial service provision; and

<p><li>Allow commercial companies to offer a full range of financial services, including individual savings and checking accounts, small business loans, consumer lines of credit, and diversified investment services.</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Enacting these recommendations is the first step in ending more than 60 years of harmful financial regulation and allowing the American financial system to take advantage of modern technology. As a guide to policymakers, this <I>Talking Points</I> reviews the history of federal laws that have prohibited integrated financial services, offers recommendations based on a conclusion that these laws are antiquated, discusses the benefits of financial services reform, and reviews current reform efforts.
<p>
<b>A BRIEF HISTORY OF FINANCIAL SERVICES REGULATION</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The general framework of modern financial service regulation was set by the Banking Act of 1933 (the Glass-Steagall Act), passed by Congress in reaction to the more than 10,000 bank failures or forced mergers between 1929 and 1933. In general, Glass-Steagall prohibits banks from offering a full range of banking services. According to Jonathan Macey and Geoffrey Miller, authors of <I>Banking Law and Regulation:</I> "Responding to political charges that the Depression had been caused by bank speculation in securities, the Glass-Steagall Act separated commercial banking from investment banking. Securities firms were not to accept deposits or affiliate with deposit-taking institutions; and commercial bank members of the Federal Reserve System were barred from participating, either directly or indirectly, in many aspects of the securities business."<sup>4</sup>  This separation evolved from a fear by politicians that commercial banks were commonly engaged in risky investments using the deposits of individuals and small businesses. From their perspective, banks were gambling with the life savings of an unsuspecting public.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Shortly before final passage of the Glass-Steagall Act, Senator Carter Glass expressed the depth of this fear: "The main purpose of the bill as passed by the Senate last spring, as Senators will recall, was to prevent, under penalty, the use of Federal Reserve banking facilities for stock-gambling purposes. I use that term in its harshest sense, realizing that it touches the sensibilities of a great many people who persist in calling it 'stock-investment purposes.'"<sup>5</sup>  These comments by one of the Act's principal sponsors epitomize the heated rhetoric that surrounded banking regulation in the early years of the Depression. It is ironic that these words are still used by legislators to justify expansion of strict banking regulations.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The driving fear behind passage of the Glass-Steagall Act in 1933 has continued to guide banking regulation ever since. Every time the banking industry found a legal way to link commercial banking with investment services or other commercial activities, federal regulators blocked the path. For example, after the passage of Glass-Steagall, many bankers created bank holding companies or umbrella organizations that owned a share of several different companies. A holding company might have owned a commercial bank, an investment bank, and an insurance company. Because these holdings were separate entities, such an arrangement was legal. And although such an arrangement was not very efficient, it did offer bank holding companies many of the advantages of integrated banking.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, however, was passed to prevent these bank holding companies from simultaneously owning such diverse financial entities. Specifically, the Act "was intended to make bank holding companies subject to federal regulation and, more specifically, to get all of them out of commerce."<sup>6</sup>  Moreover, the same fears about bigness and the safety of individual savings that led to passage of Glass-Steagall also led to passage of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. The principal sponsor of the 1956 Act, Senator Willis Robertson of Virginia, did not hesitate to invoke the shade of his fellow Virginian and predecessor, Carter Glass, recalling that "as early as 1938 Glass realized that the restrictions provided were not adequate to protect independent bankers from possible monopolistic situations and he sought to have them strengthened.... My own efforts to pick up and carry on the attempts of my predecessor to regulate bank holding companies more effectively began in 1949."<sup>7</sup>  As John Kareken notes, "Revealing its fear of bigness, a fear linking it to Congresses past and future, the Eighty-fifth Congress responded with the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956."<sup>8</sup>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This fear of bigness and belief that integrated banks were too risky with individual deposits were evident throughout the 1960s and 1970s as federal courts and regulators continued to separate commercial and investment banking. In a 1981 decision, the Supreme Court declared: "Congress was persuaded that speculative activities, partially attributable to the connection between commercial banking and investment banking, had contributed to the rash of bank failures [leading up to the Great Depression]."<sup>9</sup>  As recently as March 1995, these fears continued to influence congressional action (or in this case, inaction). Testifying before the House Committee on Banking and Financial Services, James L. Bothwell, Director of Financial Institutions and Markets Issues for the General Accounting Office, asked: "How would the public respond if a major company that owned a bank got into trouble?  How would regulators be able to maintain adequate supervision of the company as a whole?"<sup>10</sup>  Because lawmakers evidently found this possibility disconcerting, federal law has continued to prevent banks and bank holding companies from engaging in any other commercial or financial activity, in hopes of preventing bank failures and the loss of depositor money.
<p>
<b>THE CASE FOR REFORM</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
Two main fears have guided the mandatory separation of commercial banking and investment banking: risk of loss and conflict of interest. These fears have guided federal policy at least since the Depression. However, studies undertaken over the past 35 years have demonstrated that these fears are groundless. This research has demonstrated that integrated banking, a free market in which financial companies are free to engage in any activity they wish, leads to banks that are both safer and less prone to failure. Moreover, most banks carefully avoid a possible conflict of interest because to do so is in the best interest of the company and its investors. The natural conclusion is that laws and regulations which prohibit integrated banking should be eliminated and that commercial banks, bank holding companies, insurance providers, investment banks, and other commercial firms should be allowed to enter a full range of financial and commercial activities.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Risk of Loss.</b> Perhaps the greatest fear lawmakers have expressed concerning the relationship between commercial banking and investment or other financial activities is that the inherent risk of such endeavors places deposited money in jeopardy. A loss could destroy the financial security of people who have deposited their life savings in the bank.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Nor has the bank holding company structure been viewed as any safer with respect to investment money. It is feared, for example, that a bank might simply transfer capital to an affiliated investment bank or insurance company. Considered equally dangerous, "a bank might purchase securities from its affiliate at greater-than-market prices or sell securities and make loans to facilitate securities purchases from the affiliate at less-than-market prices."<sup>11</sup>  In any case, the concern is that bankers would worry first about their own financial interest and only then about the security of bank depositors' money.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If these risks indeed were a threat, or if bankers really were concerned only about their own financial security, banks that engaged in stock market investment before passage of Glass-Steagall would have failed at a greater rate than those which did not involve themselves in such activities. However, this was not the case. In fact, studies have shown that banks involved in securities activities were less likely to fail than those not involved in investing. Eugene White investigated and found that "while 26.3 percent of all national banks failed in this period [from 1930-1933], only 6.5 percent of the 62 banks which had [investment] affiliates in 1929 and 7.6 percent of the 145 banks which conducted large operations through their bond departments closed their doors (see Chart 2)."<sup>12</sup>  On average, banks that engaged in investment activities failed less frequently than those that did not.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The reason for the relative stability among integrated banks, as White notes, was their ability to diversify financial activities during a period of slow commercial banking. "This diversification allowed banks to gain new business as their more traditional activities stagnated and to take advantage of significant complementarities in the production of financial services."<sup>13</sup>  Also, integrated banks, primarily from necessity, tended to have larger asset bases which allowed them greater economies of scale during difficult economic times. Ironically, one of the regulators' greatest fears -- bigness -- was actually an asset to banks during the early years of the Depression.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Conflict of Interest.</b> Another important concern of bank regulators is that integrated banks would represent a clear conflict of interest that could lead bank owners and managers to put their own financial interest before that of depositors. For example, many fear that a bank underwriting equity in a company faces a perverse incentive to influence its depositors to invest in that company, even if such an investment is unsound. Banks would have an easy time persuading investors, often considered na<ve, to make risky investments. Senator Robert Bulkley summed up this belief in 1932: "The banker ought to be regarded as the financial confidant and mentor of his depositors. Obviously, the banker who has nothing to sell to his depositors is much better qualified to advise disinterestedly and to regard diligently the safety of depositors than the banker who uses the list of depositors in his savings department to distribute circulars concerning the advantages of this, that or the other investment."<sup>14</sup>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Securities issued by commercial banks or affiliates would have underperformed when compared to securities issued by investment banks if the fear expressed by Senator Bulkley and others were well-grounded. However, evidence from the period before passage of Glass-Steagall indicates otherwise. Randall Krozner and Raghurm Rajan, professors at the University of Chicago, have found that between 1924 and 1940, "investment bank underwritten issues experienced roughly 40 percent more defaults than [did] affiliate underwritten issues."<sup>15</sup>  Additionally, they found that commercial banks and their affiliates tended to underwrite "higher-quality issues" of larger companies that were inherently safer.<sup>16</sup>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Integrated banks tended to underwrite safer securities because the market corrected for the exact fear that legislators wished to regulate away: a risk of individual savings. Most depositors at integrated banks looked very closely at the investment portfolio of their bank to ensure a desirable level of security. Contrary to Senator Bulkley's fears, depositors made informed, sound investment decisions. Investors who were concerned not with safety, but with the potential for a greater return generally went to investment banks. Krozner and Rajan conclude:<blockquote>

Indeed, our results suggest that the public markets and rating agencies were aware of the potential for conflicts (or weak reputations) of the affiliates. The affiliates appear to have responded to the market's concerns by  underwriting primarily more senior securities and securities of older, larger, and better-known firms than did the investment banks.<sup>17</sup></blockquote>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Thus, the market during the 1920s -- before passage of the Glass-Steagall Act -- was acting efficiently, with integrated commercial banks serving small investors concerned with safety and investment banks serving larger investors seeking a substantial but openly risky return.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;All of this evidence leads to a conclusion far different from the one historically driving federal banking regulation: Integrated banks tend to be safer and less averse to conflicts of interest than a combined system of purely investment banks and purely commercial banks.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<b>Advancing Technology</b>. The historic evidence by itself is enough to warrant a change in federal financial regulations. However, there is an additional impetus to action. Modern technology has allowed expansion of the financial services sector to the point where banks as traditionally defined are rapidly becoming obsolete. Yet institutions unfortunate enough to be classified as banks are unable to capitalize on new financial opportunities because federal regulations are still guided by laws and principles derived in the 1930s. Not only are banks hurt, but consumers are unable to take advantage of more profitable opportunities made possible by technology.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Consider the following:<ul>
<p><li>An average money market mutual fund earns a 4.76 percent annual rate of return,<sup>18</sup> and many offer free checking services. The average commercial bank checking account earns less than 4.0 percent interest annually, and consumers often must pay a service charge for each check or transfer. Although mutual funds are growing in popularity, many consumers do not take advantage of these financial instruments because, with rare exceptions, commercial banks are prohibited from offering them. In many cases, these consumers simply are unaware of the mutual fund option.

<p><li>Many small businesses cannot expand (or even start) because equity capital is difficult and expensive to secure. Such companies are limited in their expansion potential because they cannot incur additional debt. Moreover, these difficulties place small businesses at a disadvantage in comparison to larger corporations that enjoy ready access to investment services and are more able to afford the overhead costs of obtaining equity. Integrated financial service provision would allow local banks and providers to underwrite small local businesses and finance entrepreneurs.

<p><li>Many commercial companies have created financial service departments or affiliates. Banks, on the other hand, are prohibited from entering other commercial sectors. Therefore, they cannot take full advantage of the technology that has made it possible for companies such as General Electric, Ford, and Sears to offer various financially related services such as commercial loans, credit cards, and personal insurance.

<p><li>Technology renders many of the services to which commercial banks are limited obsolete. Today, even small investors can take advantage of large potential earnings by pooling their funds. Additionally, computers and the Internet make financial services more accessible -- but not nearly as accessible as they might be in a world without federal regulations against integrated banking. Commercial banks have the infrastructure to provide an efficient retail market. There are banks in every town in America, often on every corner in larger cities. And while the percentage of the population owning a personal computer with access to the Internet is increasing, nearly 100 percent of the population currently has easy access to a bank. If these banks were allowed to offer a full range of financial services, millions of consumers could take advantage of increased earnings. The economy as a whole also would benefit from a more efficient allocation of financial resources.</ul>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The rate at which technology is capable of changing also makes deregulation necessary. As mentioned above, for each federal regulation that aims to prevent integrated banking, the private sector devises a legal bypass. This process is like a perpetual motion machine: As the pace of technological advance quickens, federal regulations become obsolete all the more rapidly.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Consider just two facts:
<ol><p><li>The pace of technological change over the past ten years has tended to follow Moore's Law. Named for Intel founder Gordon Moore, this law dictates that the power of advanced technology will double roughly every 18 months. In other words, the life cycle of most modern technology is less than two years.

<p><li>The average regulation takes more than two years to conceive, develop, and implement. And this does not include the time needed to legislate changes in major regulations and the time consumed by court proceedings to interpret those regulations.
</ol>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Taken together, these facts lead to one overriding question: How can government possibly keep pace with such rapidly changing technology?

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Perhaps the best example of the change technology will bring to the financial services sector is the creation of digital money, often referred to as "e-cash."  E-cash, in its purest form, represents an on-line account that can be used in a manner similar to a debit card. Often called stored-value cards, e-cash accounts are being developed by many non-bank entities. Should non-bank providers be subject to the same reserve requirements and regulations as banks, and will e-cash accounts be covered under federal deposit insurance?<sup>19</sup>  These questions will have to be answered as electronic commerce becomes increasingly popular. But the first question that needs to be addressed is: Will a government-run regulatory structure that takes years to promulgate even a simple rule be able to respond to a technology that has the potential to emerge and change within months?  The answer is that it will not.
<p>
<b>RECOMMENDATIONS</b>
 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The ultimate goal of financial modernization must be to eliminate all barriers that exist between commercial banking, investment banking, and all other commercial and financial activities. It is impossible to repair a system as broken as the current federal financial regulatory system. The only sensible course is to sweep away 60 years of government intervention in financial services and begin anew with a free and open financial market. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Specifically, Congress and the President should:<ol>

<p><li><b>Repeal the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, which prohibits umbrella holding companies from owning diverse financial businesses, and the 1970 amendments that expand these restrictions to commercial businesses.</b> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The first logical step in financial modernization is to allow diverse firms to affiliate under a single umbrella company. Currently, any company that owns a commercial bank is prohibited from owning any other financial service company such as an insurance firm or investment bank. The intent of this restriction is to prevent companies from using the commercial bank's deposits to subsidize risky investments. In reality, however, the Bank Holding Company Act has increased savings and investment costs by preventing an efficient delivery of financial services.

<p><li><b>Repeal the Banking Act of 1933 (the Glass-Steagall Act), which prohibits financial service companies from offering a full range of financial and commercial services.</b>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;True free-market reform would not stop at allowing only affiliations between diverse companies. Individual financial service firms should be permitted to provide a whole range of services, financial and otherwise. This can be accomplished only by repealing the Glass-Steagall Act.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It is unclear whether financial service companies, if given the opportunity would choose to structure themselves as individual firms or as financial service holding companies.<sup>20</sup>  However, a single corporate structure should not be imposed by federal fiat. Instead, companies should be free to chose the structure that best suits their customers and shareholders.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There are several reasons why financial modernization legislation should include repeal of both the Glass-Steagall Act of 1993 and the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956: <b>First</b>, smaller financial institutions would benefit. These small companies, many serving rural communities, would find it difficult to affiliate with other financial service companies. In order to take advantage of the opportunities flowing from deregulation, small companies might have to "go it alone" and provide insurance, underwriting, and other services within the structure of an individual company.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Second</b>, economic efficiency might require an individual firm to offer a full complement of financial services. A firm with an extensive retail network could find it more advantageous to offer expanded services within its existing structure. For example, a commercial bank with an extensive branch system in place might not want to purchase an insurance company with an entirely separate network of branches. Instead, the bank might find it more efficient to expand services available at existing branches. This would benefit customers by increasing convenience and decreasing transaction costs. The most important goal of modernization should be to ensure that choices about diversification are left to individual firms and not mandated by the federal government.

<p><li><b>Eliminate federal regulatory barriers to integrated financial service provision.</b> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
It is not enough simply to remove statutory restrictions against integrated banking. Sixty years of federal regulations, rules, and tedious oversight also must be rolled back. And while statutes such as the Banking Act of 1933 and Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 have set the general framework for federal involvement in financial services, it has been the daily actions of federal regulatory agencies that have tightened the grip on America's financial system.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
As with all government agencies, the federal financial regulatory agencies are slow to change. Beginning in the mid-1980s, federal regulators did begin to allow some "well-capitalized" banks to provide limited investment and commercial services. These are steps in the right direction, but because they are exceptions to the rules and are applied somewhat arbitrarily, they create distortions in the financial services market. These exclusions also complicate the regulatory structure so that similar banks with identical characteristics often are treated differently. Moreover, banks without political clout are denied the opportunity to diversify their operations and subsequently are placed at a competitive disadvantage. Finally, it is increasingly difficult for federal regulators to keep pace with changes in technology.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Rolling back the regulatory powers of the various federal financial agencies is every bit as essential as repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 and Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. Only when financial service companies are free from both statutory restraints and regulatory burdens will they be able to take full advantage of the free market.
<p>
<li><b>Allow commercial companies to offer a full range of financial services, including individual savings and checking accounts, small business loans, consumer lines of credit, and diversified investment services.</b> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Once existing regulations are eliminated, there will be no restrictions on the financial or investment opportunities available to commercial firms. Any future regulation or federal government action should be concerned only with securing a minimum safety net for individual depositors. Every other transaction and financial service company should be left to the free market.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There has been much talk recently of creating a two-way street between insurance companies and commercial banks. True free-market financial modernization would go well beyond this to create a virtual autobahn of activity. Financial service companies should be allowed to offer any service they wish and to choose for themselves the companies with which they want to be affiliated. Likewise, commercial firms should be allowed to enter the financial market at any point that seems most advantageous for them. This integration and free entry will breed entrepreneurship, which in turn will produce lower costs and make available more consumer services.</ol>

<p>
<b>Benefits of These Recommendations</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
 <b>Increase the safety and soundness of all banks.</b> First-year economics students learn that diversity helps increase stability. Likewise, any investor who desires a safe portfolio diversifies his investments. The past 60 years of financial regulation have ignored this basic economic understanding, and banks have continued to fail as a result. Integrated financial service provision will increase the safety and soundness of all financial companies by allowing them to diversify their operations just as individual investors and other commercial companies do.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;History proves that banks with diverse operations are less likely to fail than those restricted to specific activities. Research by Eugene White, for example, has demonstrated that in the 1920s, before passage of the Glass-Steagall Act, banks engaged in investment activities were less likely to fail than banks engaged solely in consumer activities (see Chart 2).<sup>21</sup>  In fact, the majority of banks that failed during the late 1920s were small banks with limited investments and activities. No witnesses testifying in 1931, including the Comptroller of the Currency, the chairman of the Board of Directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and numerous bank executives, mentioned securities-related activity as the cause of any bank failures.<sup>22</sup>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A second example is provided by the failure of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s. As early as 1982, analysts were predicting a bleak outlook for S&Ls. Brookings Institution economist Andrew Carron wrote that "As a result of this decline in net worth and asset values, between 15 and 27 percent of the federally insured firms in the [savings and loan] industry would find themselves in an untenable position: without drastic cost cutting, good fortune, or a cash infusion from the government, they would be unable to return to break-even operations. Ultimately, they would fail."<sup>23</sup>  Indeed, between August 1989 and the end of 1992, 642 savings and loans failed. The primary reason, again predicted by Carron, was that "[t]ax laws and regulatory practice have forced savings and loans and mutual savings banks to hold fixed-rate long-term residential mortgages as their principal assets and to accept the short-term deposits of households as their major source of funds."<sup>24</sup>  Looking back on the crisis, Alan Gart wrote that the number one reason so many S&Ls failed was "a combination of mismatched maturities of fixed-rate mortgages and variable-rate short term deposits during a period of rising interest rates."<sup>25</sup>  In other words, savings and loans were not allowed to diversify their services or their assets. As long as mortgage rates and consumer interest rates were compatible, this was not a problem. But as soon as the housing market turned sour, many S&Ls failed because they had no offsetting profitable activities.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Integrated financial service provision would allow financial service companies to diversify their investment portfolios so that downturns in one sector could be offset by upturns in others. In economics, this is known as vertical integration. Integrated financial service provision also would allow diversification of services, permitting financial service companies to move resources from inactive services to those that are active and profitable. For example, when the real estate market is in a downturn, companies could move resources from the mortgage industry to a more profitable sector, such as life insurance.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;  <b>Allow regional banks a more diverse operating arena to serve their clients better.</b> Many analysts believe that financial service deregulation would drive small local banks out of business and that would be the end of personal banking. On the contrary, integrated financial service provision would allow local financial companies to expand the arena in which they operate, thereby increasing the number of services they can offer their local community. Local financial companies are best able to understand the unique needs of the communities in which they operate, and expanding the opportunities of these companies will allow them to meet their community needs more effectively.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Also, integrated financial service provision would allow many small, regional financial service companies to diversify their activities, which is inherently more stable. The evidence cited above shows that banks with diverse portfolios are less likely to fail. The reason for increased stability with diversification is simple. Diversity allows a financial service provider to offset slow times in one market area with growth in another. Diversity is the key to any stable investment strategy and should be allowed in the banking industry.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This would be particularly important in rural areas for two reasons. First, it is accepted increasingly that the future success of the American agriculture industry will depend on exports. Farmers and the agriculture community will need to take advantage of efficient foreign exchange markets, financial futures trading, and other mechanisms to increase export opportunities for their commodities. This is possible only if regional financial service companies are allowed increased access to these financial activities through integrated financial service provision. Second, regional rural banks historically have been subject to economic swings in the agriculture industry. Because current law limits banks to narrow fields of operation, such natural events as a drought or freeze can cause the failure of a rural bank limited to agriculture lending, and this failure can exacerbate the problems faced by a rural community. The ability to provide integrated financial services would allow rural financial service companies to diversify their activities, thus decreasing their susceptibility to swings in the agricultural industry.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
  <b>Allow small businesses and entrepreneurs to secure capital more easily.</b> One of the primary benefits of integrated financial service provision would be the ability of commercial banks to underwrite equity for businesses. This would allow small businesses to go directly to local banks to secure equity rather than being forced to go to a separate investment bank, thus incurring higher transaction costs. Also, many investment banks today do not concentrate on reaching small businesses because of the high costs involved. Capital markets would become more accessible to all businesses, especially small or regional companies, once all financial service providers were given the option of underwriting securities.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
  <b>Allow greater access to capital markets for individual investors.</b> Eugene White has noted that many commercial banks entered investment banking in the 1920s because they "had established extensive retailing networks among their depositors during [World War I]. Unlike investment bankers who generally had a small clientele of the well-to-do, commercial banks had large numbers of potential customers, each of whom could invest a small amount in securities."<sup>26</sup>  These banks saw an underdeveloped market in small investors and reacted in a typical market-oriented manner until Congress prevented such a move by passing the Glass-Steagall Act.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The same opportunity exists for commercial banks today. Integrated banks would be able to take advantage of their extensive network of local branches and affiliates. Gerald O'Driscoll, Vice President and Director of Policy Analysis for Citicorp, recently wrote that "The homework banks do to process a loan application frequently duplicates that needed to write an insurance policy. Further, the distribution system is already present in every bank lobby."<sup>27</sup>  Likewise, insurance agents and other networked financial service providers would be able to offer their customers more services at lower cost. This all means that consumers who have access to a local bank or insurance agency, but not to the Internet or an investment bank, will be provided with more options when investing their savings.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
  <b>Require fewer transaction costs for customers.</b> Not only would integrated financial service provision provide greater access to financial markets for all investors and businesses, but it would do so more efficiently in many instances. As mentioned above, commercial banks have an extensive network of local offices, affiliates, automated teller machines (ATMs), and branches. Accompanying this structure is a communications and managerial infrastructure that must be duplicated by a separate investment bank and a separate insurance agency. By combining these services, consumers would be able to take advantage of economies of scale.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Many of the administrative duties required by banks also duplicate those required by insurance agents or investment companies. For example, a loan mortgage application contains much the same information as a homeowner's insurance contract. Likewise, a business loan application requires much the same financial information as a request for securities underwriting. If a single financial institution could offer all of these services, many of these duplicated efforts would be eliminated and costs reduced. Reduced costs allow individuals and businesses to make more valuable purchases and more investors and entrepreneurs to enter the financial markets.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Finally, integrated financial service provision would lead more financial service institutions to offer discount brokerage service, mutual funds, and other similar opportunities. Many individuals unable to reach these markets in the past because of high transaction costs were forced to settle for a single savings vehicle, even if that vehicle was not ideally suited to their needs. These investors, often of the lower working class, would be able to access a greater selection of investments and would soon realize a higher rate of return on their savings. Additionally, the market in general would perform more efficiently because a larger part of aggregate savings would be invested in more efficient and profitable avenues.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;  <b>Allow capital to flow through the American economy more efficiently.</b> Many economists believe that prohibiting integrated financial service provision is a drag on the American economy because savings are not allocated efficiently. As Michael Porter has written, "The United States possesses an enormous pool of investment capital. The problem lies in how this capital is allocated -- at what rates and into what kinds of investments."<sup>28</sup>  For example, restrictions on the activities of commercial banks prevent them from informing investors about the full range of opportunities available to them. Also, the transaction costs of dealing with two separate banks (one commercial and the other investment) prevent many investors from moving their capital from a less profitable investment to a more profitable one because it is simply too inconvenient. The result is that investment is not directed toward its most efficient end.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Demand and supply of capital investment would be met better if financial service companies were allowed to offer a full range of investment opportunities and commercial businesses were able to offer financial services. More investors would have access to a broader range of investment vehicles. Increased consumer selection would lead more individuals to make better choices in the investment methods they employ. And the increased competition would force financial service providers to improve the quality of their products and increase the efficiency with which they deliver those products to the market.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
  <b>Decrease the cost of capital faced by American companies.</b> A more efficient allocation of investment would lead to a lower cost of capital. First, transaction costs would decrease. Transaction costs constitute a significant component of the cost of capital faced by companies in the American financial market. An integrated financial services system would enable a company to complete more financial transactions through a single broker-dealer, eliminating the need for duplicate paperwork and other such administrative expenses.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Closely related to a decrease in transaction costs is a more efficient allocation of economic resources. Current financial regulations, by definition, obstruct the natural market flow of capital, thus creating an inefficient distribution system. Capital would be allocated more efficiently if unhindered by artificial government barriers. A more efficient delivery system would produce less expensive capital for American businesses.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Third, a closer relationship between banks and commercial interests would form because banks would be both lenders and owners of companies. A financial service provider that owns stock in a company through the underwriting process has a stake in the success of that company and is more likely to work closely with the other owners to avoid bankruptcy. Large companies also would be able to carry a greater amount of debt (in relation to equity), which would lower the cost of capital because debt is usually less expensive than equities. The lower cost of debt would lead to a lower cost of capital.<sup>29</sup>  This, and the decreased risk of bankruptcy, would produce more stable companies and lower prices.
<p>

<b>THE MYTHS AND REALITY OF REFORM</b>
<p>
<b>MYTH: Independent insurance agents will be driven out of business.</b>
<p>
<b>REALITY: The future is not bright for independent insurance agents, even without significant financial modernization.</b> Technology has made it possible for insurance companies to sell policies directly to consumers without relying on distribution by agents. For example, some insurance companies are offering their services on the Internet. This technological bridge between producer and consumer makes the independent agent an expensive -- if not unnecessary -- intermediate. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
True integrated financial service legislation would allow a single company to offer any financial or commercial service or, optionally, to affiliate with any financial or commercial entity. A "two-way street" would be created whereby commercial banks could begin to offer insurance products and insurance agents could provide banking services. Thus, insurance agents and bankers would be equally free to engage in a full range of financial services. Insurance agents, for this reason, and with the impetus of an otherwise bleak future, should support full deregulation so they can diversify their operations and increase their customer base.
<p>
<b>MYTH: Small local banks will be eliminated as large national financial service providers become more powerful.</b>
<p>
<b>REALITY: Local banks will always have a place in the financial services industry.</b> The personal service and unique products they can provide will allow small banks to fill a market niche. A recent <I>Wall Street Journal</I> article highlighted the story of Catawba Valley Bank, a new local bank opened on November 1, 1995, in Hickory, North Carolina.<sup>30</sup>  The bank, which prides itself on individual attention and local investments, was launched by Steve Aaron, who left his job as an executive officer of a large statewide bank. The story of Catawba Valley is not unique: New U.S. bank charters rose to nearly 150 in 1995, almost 300 percent more than during the previous year.<sup>31</sup>  Clearly, there is a demand for local banks that can deal with customers in a personal manner. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Moreover, integrated financial service provision would give local banks the ability to offer more services to their customers, thus increasing their ability to survive. Just as General Motors and Ford are able to offset slow sales of luxury sedans with increased sales of all-purpose trucks or gas-efficient compacts, so would financial service providers be able to offset slow mortgage loan sales with increased mutual fund investments. The increased stability of integrated financial service provision benefits not only the financial institution itself, but also the consumers. A stable financial institution precludes the cost and inconvenience of changing financial vendors and opening new accounts.
<p>
<b>MYTH: Integrated banks will make risky investments with deposited money.</b>
<p>
<b>REALITY: Economic theory and historic evidence both indicate that integrated financial service companies would make safe investments with deposited money or else pay a premium for risky activity.</b> Many investors are interested in earning a high rate of return on their deposits, and willing to accept the risk that accompanies the possibility of such a payoff. On the other hand, many investors seek a safe harbor for their funds (or at least a minimal portion of them) and prefer financial service providers that make only secure investments. And while safety-seeking investors cannot expect as high a rate of return on their deposits, they can be sure of the safety of their investments.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This system is essentially a pricing system for financial services. It would operate just as the pricing of automobiles does. Buyers who want a safe car that gets good gas mileage are willing to pay more than somebody looking for the economy of a used motorcycle. The important point is that the market will deliver the services (in this case, financial investment tools) that consumers demand. And because many investors seek a secure harbor for at least part of their savings, the market will deliver financial service providers that make such secure investments possible. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The work of Kroszner and Rajan indicates that before passage of the Glass-Steagall Act in 1933, commercial banks engaged in equity underwriting made more secure investments in larger businesses than did pure investment banks.<sup>32</sup>  Thus, banks free to invest in any manner they wished realized that their customers expected a degree of safety and therefore made relatively secure investments.<sup>33</sup>
<p>
<b>RECENT CONGRESSIONAL ACTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Two major reform proposals were advanced during the first session of the 104th Congress. These bills represent the third time in the past five Congresses that repeal of financial service separation laws has been attempted. Compromise legislation failed in 1988 and 1991. Both of last year's proposals would amend the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 by allowing bank holding companies to affiliate with other financial service providers, although neither bill would allow a single company to engage in a full range of financial services.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Representative Jim Leach (R-IA), Chairman of the House Banking Committee, introduced H.R. 1062, the Financial Services Competitiveness Act of 1995, on February 27. Chairman Leach's bill would allow a "financial services holding company" to own both banking and investment affiliates. This would lead to a greater integration of commercial banking and investment banking. Chairman Leach's original bill would not have allowed a financial services holding company to own an insurance affiliate, however. Also, any holding company that currently has an insurance affiliate would be required to disassociate from that firm if it wanted to acquire a commercial bank. There would be no "two-way street" and no full integration of financial services.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The second bill was introduced by Senator Alfonse D'Amato (R-NY), Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, and Representative Richard Baker (R-LA), Chairman of the House Subcommittee on Capital Markets, Securities, and Government-Sponsored Enterprises. The Depository Institution Affiliation Act (H.R. 814 as introduced by Representative Baker) would allow a commercial bank to affiliate with any other financial services company or commercial entity, including an insurance provider or an investment bank. The D'Amato-Baker proposal, because it would allow a greater range of affiliation, would lead to greater and more efficient integration of financial services than Representative Leach's bill.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The D'Amato-Baker bill presents a much purer approach to financial service integration by allowing affiliation among all financial and non-financial companies. It also would allow greater flexibility of affiliate interaction by creating fewer "firewalls" between a holding company's affiliates. For example, under Chairman Leach's bill, senior officers of one affiliate would be prohibited from simultaneously serving as senior officers of another. The D'Amato-Baker bill would extend no such restrictions. Also, and perhaps most important, the Leach bill would require holding companies themselves to be "adequately capitalized."  The D'Amato-Baker bill would place such capitalization restrictions only on insured depository affiliates.<sup>34</sup>  The overall greater freedoms allowed in the D'Amato-Baker proposal are vital first steps toward a free-market approach to integrated financial service provision. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
 Neither the Leach nor the Baker bill moved beyond the full Banking Committee in the House during 1995. The progress of both bills was stalled as representatives of the banking industry and the insurance industry failed to reach agreement on the integration of their services. This disagreement ultimately stalled all banking reform legislation. Senator D'Amato's bill was never marked up in committee as the Senate awaited action by the House.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The recent Supreme Court ruling in <I>Barnett Bank v. Nelson</I><sup>35</sup> clears the way for federal banks to sell insurance in small towns. The decision held that federal laws allowing such transactions pre-empt state laws preventing insurance sales by banks. The decision has given Chairman Leach the opportunity to push for significant reform again this year. Leach also has modified his bill to allow affiliation of banks and insurance companies, thus creating a more complete integration of financial services. However, the bill still has a number of weaknesses, including burdensome firewalls and the exclusion of non-financial commercial companies from the integration process.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Neither the new Leach bill (H.R. 2520) nor the D'Amato-Baker bill is perfect. Neither one would allow a single company to engage in a full range of financial service provisions. Affiliations would allow greater efficiency but not complete freedom for financial service companies. True reform would use the D'Amato-Baker proposal as a transition to elimination of all restrictions on financial integration. 
<p>
 <b>CONCLUSIONS</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The financial service sector is the most ubiquitous sector of the modern American economy. Commercial and investment banks, insurance companies, securities trading markets, credit card providers, and other financial services are both the backbone of the commercial market and the fuel in the American economic engine. Every day, every American depends on the financial services sector to pay bills, purchase goods, pay for education, prepare for retirement, or create a business. For this reason, it is imperative that America secure an efficient and modern financial service system.

It is impossible to create such a system within the confines of the current statutory and regulatory structure, the guiding principles of which have not changed since the early 1930s. The impetus for change is made even stronger by the rapid pace of technological change. The current regulatory structure depends on being able clearly to define a bank, an insurance agent, and a security issue. But should a shopping mall-based ATM that can process loan applications be considered a bank?<sup>36</sup>  If so, how can a machine be accused of racial bias in its decisions?  Should an Internet World Wide Web site, through which anybody can apply for an insurance policy, be considered an agent?  And if so, how can one state regulate that web page, which is globally accessible?  Even if these questions are answered within the context of the current regulatory regime, they will be replaced by others. 

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The only solution is to sweep away the past 60 years of financial regulation and begin the process of market-oriented modernization. Current financial service regulations and the thinking they embody were misguided at their creation and are certainly misguided and outdated today. A free-market approach to financial deregulation also would benefit American consumers and businesses. More profitable investments would be available; capital would be easier to obtain, and its cost would be reduced; and the financial services sector would enjoy more stability and security. These advantages would resound through the economy every day as individual investors and companies took advantage of this more efficient and secure financial sector.<p><b>ENDNOTES</b><p><ol><li>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The Stand for Children rally, held in Washington on June 1, called attention to the plight of the nation's children. However, the unstated, underlying goal was to defend the continuing growth of the welfare system and implicitly to criticize those in Congress who have sought to reform it. Thus, while the Stand for Children event properly called attention to the disastrous condition of America's children, it is important to recognize that children are suffering precisely because of the governmental policies supported over the last 25 years by the leading organizations promoting the rally.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The simple fact is that children are suffering because the U.S. welfare system has failed. Designed as a system to help children, it has ended up damaging and abusing the very children it was intended to save. The welfare system has failed because the ideas upon which it was founded are flawed. The current system is based on the assumption that higher welfare benefits and expanded welfare eligibility are good for children. According to this theory, welfare reduces poverty, and so will increase children's lifetime well-being and attainment. This is untrue. Higher welfare payments do not help children; they increase dependence and illegitimacy, which have a devastating effect on children's development.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;		Americans often are told that the current welfare system does not promote long-term dependence. This also is untrue.<ul>

<li>The 4.7 million families currently receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) already have spent, on average, six-and-a-half years on welfare.

<li>When past and estimated future receipts of AFDC are combined, the estimated average length of stay on AFDC, among those families currently receiving benefits, is 13 years.

<li>Among the 4.7 million families currently receiving AFDC, over 90 percent will spend over two years on the AFDC caseload. More than 75 percent will spend over five years on AFDC.</ul>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
It is welfare dependence, not poverty, that has the most negative effect on children.
Recent research by Congressional Budget Office Director June O'Neill shows that increasing the length of time a child spends on welfare may reduce the child's IQ by as much as 20 percent.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Welfare dependency as a child has a negative effect on the earnings and employment capacity of young men. The more welfare income received by a boy's family during his childhood, the lower the boy's earnings will be as an adult, even when compared to boys in families with identical non-welfare income.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Welfare also plays a powerful role in promoting illegitimacy. Research by CBO Director O'Neill also shows, for example, that a 50 percent increase in monthly AFDC and food stamp benefit levels will cause a 43 percent increase in the number of illegitimate births within a state. Illegitimacy, in turn, has an enormous negative effect on children's development and on their behavior as adults. Being born outside of marriage and raised in single parent homes:<ul>
<li>Triples the level of behavioral and emotional problems among children;

<li>Nearly triples the level of teen sexual activity;

<li>Doubles the probability a young woman will have children out of wedlock; and,

<li>Doubles the probability a boy will become a threat to society, engage in criminal activity, and wind up in jail.</ul>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Overall, welfare operates as a form of social toxin. The more of this toxin received by a child's family, the less successful the child will be as an adult. If America's children are to be saved, the current welfare system must be replaced. The automatic and rapid growth of welfare spending must be curtailed. Welfare should no longer be a one-way handout; recipients should be required to work for benefits received. Steps must be taken to reduce future illegitimacy, beginning with restricting cash welfare to unmarried teen mothers.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Finally, Americans must help children rise upward out of poverty and despair by enlisting the support of those institutions that have a record of real success. The evidence is clear that religious institutions have enjoyed dramatic success in reducing teen sexual activity, crime, drug use, and other problems among young people. In order to help poor children, America must rely on the healing and guiding force of the churches. This can be done by giving poor parents government-funded education vouchers which could be used to send their children to private schools, including religious schools.
<p>

<b>THE FAILED LIBERAL PARADIGM</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	The liberal welfare state is founded on faulty logic. This flawed logic, embedded in nearly all liberal thinking about welfare, runs something like this:<ul>
<li><b>PREMISE #1:</b> Children in families with higher income seem to do better in life.

<li><b>PREMISE #2:</b> Welfare can easily raise family income.

<li><b>CONCLUSION:</b> Welfare is good for kids.</ul>
<p>From this logic has sprung a relentless 30-year effort to raise welfare benefits, expand welfare eligibility, create new welfare programs, and increase welfare spending. The recent reform legislation passed by Congress sought to slow the automatic growth of welfare spending. Thus, it violated the cardinal tenets of the liberal welfare system, leading to cries of alarm from the welfare establishment and a prompt veto by President Bill Clinton.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In fact, each of the central tenets of modern welfare is misleading and deeply flawed. Together, they become a recipe for a disastrous system of aid which harms rather than helps, aggressively crushing the hopes and future of increasing numbers of young Americans. It is useful to examine each of these cardinal liberal tenets individually.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>CLAIM 1: Raising incomes is crucial to the well-being and success of children.</b> The common liberal corollary to this premise is that poverty causes such problems as crime, school failure, low cognitive ability, illegitimacy, low work ethic and skills, and drug use. Hence, reducing poverty through greater welfare spending will reduce most social problems. History refutes this belief. In 1950, nearly a third of the U.S. population was poor (twice the current rate). In the 1920s, roughly half of the population was poor by today's standard. If the theory that poverty causes social problems were true, we should have had far more social problems in those earlier periods then we do today. But crime and most other social problems have increased rather than fallen since these earlier periods.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
History and common sense both show that values and abilities within families, not family income, lead to children's success. Families with higher incomes tend to have sound values concerning self-control, deferred gratification, work, education, and marriage which they pass on to their children. It is those values, rather than the family income, that are key to the children's attainment. Attempting to raise the family income artificially through welfare is very unlikely to do much to benefit the child, but it is likely to destroy the very values that are key to the child's success.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>CLAIM 2: It is very easy to raise family income through welfare.</b> This also is untrue. Because welfare reduces work effort and promotes illegitimacy and poverty-prone single-parent families, it actually may cause an overall decrease in family incomes. Welfare is extremely efficient at replacing self-sufficiency with dependence but relatively ineffective in raising incomes and eliminating poverty.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>CLAIM 3: Higher welfare benefits and broadened eligibility will help children and improve their success in later life.</b> In certain limited cases, such as when it is needed to eliminate serious malnutrition, welfare can help. But there is no evidence that enlarging benefits and expanding enrollments in most U.S. welfare programs will improve children's lives.
<p>
<b>The Truth About Welfare.</b> In contrast to the failed premises of welfare liberalism are the following hard facts about welfare and children:<ul>

<li>Except in very limited cases, such as those involving serious malnutrition, welfare programs do not yield fewer problems and better life outcomes for children.

<li>Welfare programs intended to combat poverty do not help children but do increase welfare dependence, which in turn is very harmful to children's well-being.

<li>Welfare programs intended to raise family incomes do not benefit children but do significantly increase illegitimacy and single-parent families, which in turn have decisively negative effects on children's development.</ul>

<p>Overall, the wider and more generous the welfare "safety net," the greater the problems of dependence and illegitimacy will become, and the greater the harm to children.
<p>


<b>EXAMINING WELFARE'S IMPACT ON CHILDREN</b>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The available scientific evidence clearly refutes the liberal hypothesis that attempting to raise family income through more generous welfare payments will benefit children. For example, the average monthly value of welfare benefits (AFDC and food stamps combined) varies between states. The conventional liberal assumption is that children on welfare in states with lower benefit levels will be markedly worse off than children in states with higher benefits. Children on AFDC in high-benefit states, according to the theory, should have improved cognitive ability when compared to children without access to more generous welfare. However, research published in 1994 by now-Congressional Budget Office Director June O'Neill and Anne Hill of Queens College, City University of New York, demonstrates that this theory is incorrect. O'Neill and Hill examined the IQs of young children who were long-term welfare dependents, having spent at least half of their lives on AFDC. Contrary to the expected theory, they found that the higher welfare benefit did not improve children's cognitive performance. The IQs of long-term welfare-dependent children in low-benefit states were not appreciably different from those in high-benefit states.<sup>1</sup>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Moreover, this picture is overly optimistic. In restricting the sample to long-term dependent children, the analysis ignores the effects of higher welfare benefits in encouraging welfare enrollment and lengthening the time spent on welfare. O'Neill and Hill have shown that a 50 percent increase in monthly AFDC and food stamp benefit levels will lead to a 75 percent increase in the number of mothers with children enrolling in AFDC and a 75 percent increase in the number of years spent on welfare.<sup>2</sup> <sup>3</sup>  <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Once the effects of increased dependence are included, it becomes clear that higher welfare benefits have a decisively negative effect on children. Comparing children who were identical in social and economic factors such as race, family structure, mothers' IQ and education, family income, and neighborhood residence, Hill and O'Neill found that the more years a child spent on welfare, the lower the child's IQ. The authors make it clear that it is not poverty but welfare itself which has a damaging effect on the child. Examining the young children (with an average age of five-and-a-half), the authors found that those who had spent at least two months of each year since birth on AFDC had cognitive abilities 20 percent below those who had received no welfare, even after holding family income, race, parental IQ, and other variables constant. <sup>4</sup>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	O'Neill and Hill conclude:<p><blockquote>

	Our findings of a negative impact of a welfare environment are particularly troubling. After controlling for the effects of a rich array of characteristics, a mother's long-term welfare participation is associated with a significant reduction in her child's [IQ] score and this effect is reinforced by the mother's having grown up in an underclass neighborhood, defined as one with a high proportion of welfare recipients. Although long-term welfare recipients are generally poor, persistent poverty does not seem to be the main reason for the poor performance of these children. Moreover, our analysis suggests that policies that would raise the income of children on welfare simply by increasing AFDC benefits are not likely to improve cognitive development. Children on welfare in high benefit states do not perform measurably better than their counterparts in low benefit states. <sup>5</sup>
</blockquote><p>
	<b>More Evidence on Welfare's Negative Impact.</b> A similar study by Mary Corcoran and Roger Gordon of the University of Michigan shows that receipt of welfare income has negative effects on the long-term employment and earnings capacity of young boys. The study shows that, holding constant race, parental education, family structure, and a range of other social variables, higher non-welfare income obtained by the family during a boy's childhood was associated with higher earnings when the boy became an adult (over age 25). <sup>6</sup>    However, welfare income had the opposite effect: The more welfare income received by a family while a boy was growing up, the lower the boy's earnings as an adult.1<sup>7</sup>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
		Typically, liberals would dismiss this finding, arguing that families which receive a lot of welfare payments have lower total incomes than other families in society, and that it is the low overall family income, not welfare, which had a negative effect on the young boys. But the Corcoran and Gordon study compares families whose average non-welfare incomes were identical. In such cases, each extra dollar in welfare represents a net increase in overall financial resources available to the family. This extra income, according to conventional liberal welfare theory, should have positive effects on the well-being of the children. But the study shows that the extra welfare income, even though it produced a net increase in resources available to the family, had a negative impact on the development of young boys within the family. The higher the welfare income received by the family, the lower the earnings obtained by the boys upon reaching adulthood. The study suggests that an increase of $1,000 per year in welfare received by a family decreased a boy's future earnings by as much as 10 percent.<sup>8</sup>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
		Other studies have confirmed the negative effects of welfare on the development of children. For example, young women raised in families dependent on welfare are two to three times more likely to drop out and fail to graduate from high school than are young women of similar race and socioeconomic background not raised on welfare. <sup>9</sup> Similarly, single mothers raised as children in families receiving welfare remain on AFDC longer as adult parents than do single mothers not raised in welfare families, even when all other social and economic variables are held constant.<sup>10</sup>
<p>

<b>WELFARE PROMOTES ILLEGITIMACY<sup>11</sup></b>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The welfare system does added harm to children by promoting illegitimacy. The anti-marriage effects of welfare are simple and profound. The current welfare system may be conceptualized best as a system that offers each single mother with two children a "paycheck" of combined benefits worth an average of between $8,500 and $15,000, depending on the state. <sup>12</sup>  The mother has a contract with the government: She will continue to receive her "paycheck" as long as she does not marry an employed man.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;		As long as a father and mother remain unmarried, they may obtain income from two sources: the mother's welfare and the father's earnings. However, if the parents marry they must rely on the father's earnings alone. Welfare thus has made marriage economically irrational for most low-income parents. It has transformed marriage from a legal institution designed to protect and nurture children into an institution that financially penalizes nearly all low-income parents who enter into it.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
		Similarly, welfare has made it possible to raise a child without either the father or the mother having to hold a job. Welfare thus has made a father with low education and skills at best financially irrelevant -- and at worst a net financial handicap to the mother and the child. Welfare has worked like an acid, slowly corroding the social foundation of marriage in low-income communities. All parties -- the father, the mother, and especially the child -- are damaged by this.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
		Largely because of welfare, illegitimacy and single parenthood have become the conventional "lifestyle option" for raising children in many low-income communities. As Washington Post reporter Leon Dash has shown in his book When Children Want Children, most unwed teen mothers conceive and deliver their babies deliberately rather than accidentally. <sup>13</sup> While young women do not bear unwanted children in order to reap "windfall profits" from welfare, they are very much aware of the role welfare will play in supporting them once a child is born. Thus, the availability of welfare plays an important role in influencing a woman's decision to have a child out of wedlock.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
		In welfare, as in most things in life, you get what you pay for. The current welfare system pays for non-work and non-marriage and has achieved dramatic increases in both. Scientific research confirms that welfare benefits to single mothers contribute directly to the rise in illegitimate births. June O'Neill's research has found that, holding constant a wide range of other variables such as income, parental education, and urban and neighborhood setting, a 50 percent increase in the monthly value of AFDC and food stamp benefits led to a 43 percent increase in the number of out-of-wedlock births. <sup>14</sup> Other studies showing the effect of welfare in increasing illegitimacy are listed in the appendix to this paper.
<p><b>THE SOCIAL CONSEQUENCES OF RISING ILLEGITIMACY</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	From the very beginning, children born outside of marriage have life stacked against them. The impact on the child is significant and can be permanent. Out-of-wedlock birth and growing up in a single-parent family means the child is more likely to experience:<ul>

<li>Retarded cognitive (especially verbal) development;

<li>Lower educational achievement;

<li>Lower job attainment;

<li>Increased behavior and emotional problems;

<li>Lower impulse control; and

<li>Retarded social development.
<p>
Such children are far more likely to:
<li>Engage in early sexual activity;

<li>Have children out of wedlock;

<li>Be on welfare as adults; and

<li>Engage in criminal activity.</ul>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

<b>The absence of married parents is related to retarded development in early childhood.</b> Illegitimacy leads to delays in development. A study of black infants (aged 5 to 6 months) living in households of lower socioeconomic status in America's inner cities found that male infants who experienced "minimal interaction with their fathers" had significantly lower levels of overall mental development and lower social responsiveness for novel stimuli. <sup>15</sup>  Illegitimate children tend to have lessened cognitive development. <sup>16</sup>  <sup>17</sup> <sup>18</sup>   Many of these children have problems in controlling their activity (popularly called "hyperactivity"). This lack of control usually is an indication of problems in learning that will arise later in the child's development. <sup>19</sup> The effect on boys is greater, at least in the early years. <sup>20</sup> <sup>21</sup>  
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;		Similar findings were enumerated again in the recent 1992 National Institute of Child Health and Development summary, "Outcomes of Early Childbearing: An Appraisal of Recent Evidence." <sup>22</sup>  And such findings are in line with earlier studies. For instance, Project TALENT, a federal survey commissioned in 1960, which tracked the development of 375,000 high school students from 1960 through 1971, found that children born outside marriage were likely to have lower cognitive scores, lower educational aspirations, and a greater likelihood of becoming teenage parents themselves. Once again, all of these effects were greater for boys. <sup>23</sup>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>	The absence of married parents risks emotional and behavioral problems during childhood.</b> The effects of illegitimacy continue to compound through childhood. The National Health Interview Survey of Child Health (NHIS-CH) confirms that children born out of wedlock have far more behavioral and emotional problems than do children in intact married families. These problems include:<ul>

<li>Antisocial behavior --  disobedience in school, cheating and lying; bullying and cruelty to others; breaking things deliberately; failure to feel sorry after misbehaving;

<li>Hyperactive behavior -- difficulty concentrating or paying attention; becoming easily confused; acting without thinking; being restless or overactive;

<li>Headstrong behavior -- easily losing one's temper; being stubborn, irritable, disobedient at home; arguing excessively;

<li>Peer conflict -- having trouble getting along with others, being not liked, being withdrawn;

<li>Dependent behavior --  crying too much, being too dependent on others, demanding attention, clinging to adults.
</ul>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Children raised by never-married mothers have significantly higher levels of all of the above behavior problems when compared to children raised by both biological parents. When comparisons are made between families that are identical in race, income, number of children, and mother's education, the behavioral differences between illegitimate and legitimate children actually widen. Compared to children living with both biological parents in similar socioeconomic circumstances, children of never-married mothers exhibit 68 percent more antisocial behavior, 24 percent more headstrong behavior, 33 percent more hyperactive behavior, 78 percent more peer conflict, and 53 percent more dependency. Overall, children of never-married mothers have behavioral problems that score nearly three times higher than children raised in comparable intact families.44 <sup>24</sup>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
		Children born out of wedlock have less ability to delay gratification and poorer impulse control (control over anger and sexual gratification). They have a weaker sense of conscience or sense of right and wrong. <sup>25</sup>  Adding to all this is the sad fact that the incidence of child abuse and neglect is higher among single-parent families. <sup>26</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<b>	Being born out of wedlock increases the probability of teen sexual activity.</b> Boys and girls born out of wedlock and raised by never-married mothers are two-and-a-half times more likely to be sexually active as teenagers when compared to legitimate children raised in intact married-couple families. This finding applies to both blacks and whites. Children born out of wedlock whose mothers marry after the child's birth appear to be slightly less likely to be sexually active as teens but are still twice as active, on average, as legitimate teens of intact married couples. <sup>27</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	The absence of married parents is related to poor academic performance during school years. The risks and consequences of illegitimacy continue through the middle years of childhood and express themselves in poor academic performance. A 1988 study by Sheila F. Krein and Andrea H. Beller of the University of Illinois finds that the longer the time spent in a single-parent family, the lower the education attained by a child. In general, a boy's educational attainment was cut by one-tenth of a year for each year spent as a child in a single-parent home. Controlling for family income did not reduce the magnitude of the effect noticeably. <sup>28</sup>  These findings are confirmed again and again in studies, conducted in the United States and abroad, which which demonstrate that illegitimacy is also associated with lower job and salary attainment. <sup>29</sup> <sup>30</sup>  <sup>31</sup> <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	The absence of married parents leads to intergenerational illegitimacy. Being born outside of marriage significantly reduces the chances the child will grow up to have an intact marriage. <sup>32</sup>  Children born outside of marriage themselves are three times more likely to be on welfare when they grow up. <sup>33</sup>   Daughters of single mothers are twice as likely to be single mothers themselves if they are black, and only slightly less so if they are white. <sup>34</sup>  And boys living in a single-parent family are twice as likely to father a child out of wedlock as are boys from a two-parent home. <sup>35</sup>  The TALENT study, noted earlier, already had found that children born to teenage parents are more likely to become teen parents themselves. <sup>36</sup>  <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<b>	Illegitimacy is a major factor in America's crime wave.</b> Lack of married parents, rather than race or poverty, is the principal factor in the crime rate. It has been known for some time that high rates of welfare dependency correlate with high crime rates amo
ng young men in a neighborhood. <sup>37</sup>  But more important, a major 1988 study of 11,000 individuals found that "the percentage of single-parent households with children between the ages of 12 and 20 is significantly associated with rates of violent crime and burglary."  The same study makes clear that the widespread popular assumption that there is an association between race and crime is false. Illegitimacy is the key factor. The absence of marriage, and the failure to form and maintain intact families, explains the incidence of high crime in a neighborhood among whites as well as blacks. This study also concluded that poverty does not explain the incidence of crime. <sup>38</sup>  This is a dramatic reversal of conventional wisdom.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;		Research on underclass behavior by Dr. June O'Neill confirms the linkage between crime and single-parent families. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, O'Neill found that young black men raised in single-parent families were twice as likely to engage in criminal activities when compared to black men raised in two-parent families, even after holding constant a wide range of variables such as family income, urban residence, neighborhood environment, and parents' education. Growing up in a single-parent family in a neighborhood with many other single-parent families on welfare triples the probability that a young black man will engage in criminal activity. <sup>39</sup><p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	In vetoing the welfare reform legislation passed by the House and Senate, President Clinton has embraced the central erroneous tenets of liberal welfarism. The Clinton Administration's report on welfare, which formed the basis for the President's veto, makes clear a belief that rapid and automatic increases in welfare spending are essential to the well-being of children and that any attempts to slow the growth of future welfare spending will significantly harm children. <sup>40</sup>  The organizers of the recent Stand for Children rally share a similar view.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;		The President's veto and the Stand for Children rally are both founded on the failed hypothesis that combating poverty through more generous welfare spending is crucial to children's future. This thinking is simply wrong. An expanded and more expensive welfare system will not benefit children. Instead, expansion of welfare leads to greater dependence and illegitimacy, which in turn have devastatingly negative consequences on children. Those truly concerned with the welfare of children must seek a radical transformation of the welfare system aimed not at increasing welfare spending and enrollment, but at reducing dependence and illegitimacy. That is the core of Congress's reform.

<b>APPENDIX<br>
Research on Welfare and Illegitimacy</b>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Despite repeated claims to the contrary, the overwhelming majority of scientific studies conducted in the last decade and a half show that welfare promotes illegitimacy and discourages marriage. Many show that welfare has a dramatically positive effect in increasing the level of illegitimacy in U.S. society. The following is a list of 19 studies on welfare and illegitimacy; of these, 14 have found a relationship between higher welfare benefits and increased illegitimacy.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	1. Research by Mikhail Bernstam of the Hoover Institution at Stanford University shows that childbearing by young unmarried women may increase by 6 percent in response to a 10 percent increase in monthly welfare benefits; among blacks, the increase may be as high as 10 percent. Mikhail S. Bernstam, "Malthus and Evolution of the Welfare State: An Essay on the Second Invisible Hand, Parts I and II," working papers E-88-41,42, Hoover Institution, Palo Alto, Cal., 1988.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	2. Research by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office, Dr. June O'Neill, has found that, holding constant a wide range of other variables such as income, parental education, and urban and neighborhood setting, a 50 percent increase in the monthly value of AFDC and food stamp benefits led to a 43 percent increase in the number of out-of-wedlock births. M. Anne Hill and June O'Neill, "Underclass Behaviors in the United States: Measurement and Analysis of Determinants," Center for the Study of Business and Government, Baruch College, February 1992.

	<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 3. A recent study of black Americans finds that higher welfare benefits lead to lower rates of marriage and higher numbers of children living in single-parent homes. In general, an increase of roughly $100 in the average monthly AFDC benefit per recipient child was found to lead to a drop of over 15 percent in births within wedlock among black women aged 20 to 24. Mark A. Fossett and K. Jill Kiecolt, "Mate Availability and Family Structure Among African Americans in U.S. Metropolitan Areas," <i>Journal of Marriage and Family</i>, Vol. 55 (May 1993), pp. 288-302.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	4. Research by Dr. C. R. Winegarden of the University of Toledo found that half of the increases in black illegitimacy in recent decades could be attributed to the effects of welfare. C. R. Winegarden, "AFDC and Illegitimacy Ratios: A Vector-Autoregressive Model," <i>Applied Economics</i> 20 (1988), pp. 1589-1601.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	5. Research by Shelley Lundberg and Robert D. Plotnick of the University of Washington shows that an increase of roughly $200 per month in welfare benefits per family causes the teenage illegitimate birth rate in a state to increase by 150 percent. Shelley Lundberg and Robert D. Plotnick, "Adolescent Premarital Child Bearing: Do Opportunity Costs Matter?," discussion paper no. 90-23, University of Washington, Institute for Economic Research, Seattle, 1990.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	6. Research by Dr. Martha Ozawa of Washington University in St. Louis has found that an increase in AFDC benefit levels of $100 per child per month leads to roughly a 30 percent increase in out-of-wedlock births to women age 19 and under. Martha N. Ozawa, "Welfare Policies and Illegitimate Birth Rates Among Adolescents: Analysis of State-by-State Data," <i>Social Work Research and Abstracts</i> 14 (1989), pp. 5-11.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	7. Recent research presented at a meeting at the National Academy of Sciences by Mark Rosenzweig of the University of Pennsylvania showed a reduction in AFDC payments of $130 per month could lead to a 40 percent drop in out-of-wedlock births among low income women under age 22. Mark R. Rosenzweig, "Welfare, Marital Prospects and Nonmarital Childbearing," December 1995.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	8. Another recent study finds large effects of welfare on illegitimacy. A 20 percent increase in welfare benefit levels across all states would increase the probability of teen out-of-wedlock births by as much as 16 percent. (However, the authors state that these findings should be treated cautiously because they were not proven to be statistically significant.) Chong-Bum An, Robert Haveman, and Barbara Wolfe, "Teen Out-of-Wedlock Births and Welfare Receipt: the Role of Childhood Events and Economic Circumstance," <i>The Review of Economics and Statistics</i>, May 1993.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	9. A recent study by Charles Murray finds a positive effect of welfare on illegitimacy. Charles Murray, "Welfare and the Family: The U.S. Experience," <i>Journal of Labor Economics</i>, Vol. 11, Pt. 2 (1993), pp. 224-262.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	10. Another study by Robert Plotnick finds a positive effect of welfare on illegitimacy. Robert D. Plotnick, "Welfare and Out-of-Wedlock Childbearing: Evidence from the 1980's," <i>Journal of Marriage and the Family</i>, August 1990, pp. 735-46.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	11. A study by Paul T. Schultz finds higher welfare benefits significantly reduce marriage rates. Paul T. Schultz, "Marital Status and Fertility in the United States," <i>The Journal of Human Resources</i>, Spring 1994, pp. 637-659.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	12. A study by Scott South and Kim Lloyd finds a positive relationship between welfare and the percentage of births which are out-of-wedlock. Scott J. South and Kim M. Lloyd, "Marriage Markets and Non-Marital Fertility in the United States," <i>Demography</i>, May 1992, pp. 247-264.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	13. A recent study by Phillip Robins and Paul Fronton finds that higher welfare benefits lead to more births among never-married women. Phillip K Robins and Paul Fronton, "Welfare Benefits and Family Size Decisions of Never-Married Women," <i>Institute for Research on Poverty: Discussion Paper</i>, DP #1022-93, September 1993.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	14. A recent Rand Corporation study finds higher welfare benefits increase illegitimate births. Catherine A. Jackson and Jacob Alex Klerman, "Welfare, Abortion and Teenage Fertility," RAND research paper, August 1994.

	

	<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	The following five studies found no relationship between higher welfare benefits and illegitimacy. Significantly, no study has ever found that welfare has a positive effect in reducing illegitimacy and promoting marriage.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	1. Gregory Acs, "The Impact of AFDC on Young Women's Childbearing Decisions," Institute for Research on Poverty, Discussion Paper # 1011-93. This study finds a small relationship between higher welfare benefits and total births to white women, but no significant relationship between welfare and illegitimate births. The study does, however, show that being raised in a single-parent home doubles the probability that a young woman will have a child out of wedlock.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	2. Greg J. Duncan and Saul D. Hoffman, "Welfare Benefits Economic Opportunities and Out-of-Wedlock Births Among Black Teenage Girls," <i>Demography</i> 27 (1990), pp. 519-535. This study finds no effect of welfare on illegitimacy.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	3. David Ellwood and Mary Jo Bane, "The Impact of AFDC on Family Structure and Living Arrangements," Harvard University, March, 1984. This study finds no effect of welfare on illegitimacy.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	4. David E. Keefe, "Governor Reagan, Welfare Reform, and AFDC Fertility," <i>Social Service Review</i>, June 1983, pp. 235-253. This study found no link between welfare and illegitimacy.

<li>         The impact of increasing the lenience and generosity of welfare in undermining work and prolonging dependence has been confirmed by controlled scientific experiment. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, social scientists at the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO) conducted a series of controlled experiments to examine the effect of welfare benefits on work effort. The longest running and most comprehensive of these experiments was conducted between 1971 and 1978 in Seattle and Denver, and became known as the Seattle/Denver Income Maintenance Experiment, or "SIME/DIME."  Advocates of expanding welfare had hoped that SIME/DIME and similar experiments conducted in other cities would prove that generous welfare benefits did not affect "work effort" adversely. Instead, the SIME/DIME experiment found that each $1.00 of extra welfare given to low-income persons reduced labor and earnings by an average of $0.80. The significant anti-work effects of welfare benefits were shown in all social groups, including married women, single mothers, and husbands. The results of the SIME/DIME study are directly applicable to existing welfare programs: Nearly all have strong anti-work effects like those studied in the SIME/DIME experiment. See: Gregory B. Christiansen and Walter E. Williams, "Welfare Family Cohesiveness and Out of Wedlock Births," in Joseph Peden and Fred Glahe, <i>The American Family and the State</i> (San Francisco: Pacific Institute for Public Policy Research, 1986), p. 398.

<li>         A further refinement of the Corcoran and Gordon study adjusted for differences in years spent by a family in poverty. The study showed that, in general, if two families had the same level of non-welfare income and spent the same amount of time "in poverty," the more welfare income received by the family, the worse the consequences for a boy raised in the family. For example, if two boys were raised in families with identical non-welfare incomes and spent the same time "in poverty," the more welfare received by one of the families, the lower the earnings of the boy raised in that family when he becomes an adult.

<a href="bg1081b.html#ahs">What Shortage of Affordable Housing?</a>
<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Henry Cisneros's bold plan to introduce the benefits of market competition into the troubled public housing industry has been stymied in Congress by an alliance of moderate Republicans and liberal Democrats. Yet, despite the opposition, these ideas -- which first took hold during the Reagan and Bush Administrations (especially during Jack Kemp's tenure at HUD) -- have shown remarkable resiliency. With the support of House reformers and leaders, and with bold intervention from the federal courts, there is a good chance that these needed reforms in America's New Deal housing policies will survive lobbying efforts of a public housing industry determined to preserve its costly taxpayer-supported monopoly over housing for the poor. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Ensuring this will be no easy task, however, as both the House and Senate committees with jurisdiction over housing policy already have produced bills that would reverse 25 years of market-based reform and, in the process, serve fewer needy families for the taxpayer dollars spent. The Senate's version (S.1260) has passed the floor. The companion version in the House (H.R. 2406) is scheduled for a vote in early May, but confronts a competing reform bill (H.R. 2198) developed by freshman Representatives Sue Myrick (R-NC) and Sam Brownback (R-KS). Significantly, the freshman bill is co-sponsored by the House leadership. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This clash over housing reform is far more than a dispute over spending levels. It is a dispute over how government should help the poor and a chance for the new congressional leadership to end the public housing industry's stranglehold -- a stranglehold that has hurt tenants as well as taxpayers and turned many of America's public housing projects into costly disasters. The leadership's attention, support, and intervention will be essential, both in defending reform against the public housing industry's lobbying juggernaut and in focusing lawmakers on the issues at stake.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What is at stake today is what has been at stake in every year since the early 1970s, when HUD first attempted to extract itself from the costly housing policies of the New Deal: the choice between <I>tenant-based</I> assistance and <I>project-based</I> assistance. Rent vouchers and certificates, the primary means of tenant-based assistance, provide eligible families with the cash equivalent to rent the apartment of their choice, subject to a cap based on local "fair market rents."  They empower tenants and introduce market discipline into the assisted-rental market, forcing landlords and developers to seek to provide the best value for money.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In contrast, with project-based assistance (including public housing), the eligible family is offered an apartment in a building constructed and operated exclusively to house the poor. With its origins in the Depression, project-based public housing was developed as much for its direct job-creating potential as it was to meet the housing needs of the indigent; it is this dual purpose, among other factors, that explains why project-based assistance, on average, costs up to twice as much as vouchers for each family assisted. These units typically are owned and operated by government or nonprofit organizations, although some for-profit developers have been given significant tax and other financial incentives to provide such buildings. This approach empowers landlords and developers, whose incentive is to lobby Washington and produce housing as expensively as possible, not to provide value to tenants or the taxpayer.
<p>
<b>TIME TO GIVE THE POOR A CHOICE</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The significant cost difference is one of the key reasons for the shift, under both Democrat and Republican Administrations, toward vouchers and away from public housing. But the different approaches also have led to dramatic differences in the quality of life for assisted families, and this has been another compelling reason for HUD's repeated attempts to extract itself from this Depression-era program. 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Because public housing serves only the poor, typically in large complexes of a hundred or more units, families assisted by this program are rigidly segregated from the rest of society, always by income class and also by education and workforce participation. In the major urban areas, public housing residents are segregated almost exclusively by race. Indeed, one would be hard-pressed to find another American institution that induces measures of racial segregation as effectively as does public housing.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Apparently the courts agree. In April of this year, in settling a desegregation suit brought against HUD by the American Civil Liberties Union of Maryland on behalf of several Baltimore public housing tenants, HUD agreed to desegregate its Baltimore public housing projects, to tear down the decrepit buildings, and to provide the majority of the displaced tenants with vouchers that can be used to rent privately owned apartments within the greater Baltimore metropolitan area (see <a href="bg1081b.html">box</a>).
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In contrast with public housing, vouchers allow the assisted family to choose its place of residence from private landlords in the community, provided that the required rent stays within the established limits. This freedom allows assisted families to escape the worst urban communities. As a 1994 congressional report observed, "Studies have found that recipients of tenant-based rental assistance were less likely than public housing residents to live in concentrated poor urban communities.... "<sup>1</sup> With vouchers, a family with children can choose a safer neighborhood with good schools; an unemployed individual can relocate to a part of the community with better job prospects; and an elderly couple can choose a place close to family, friends, and convenient shopping. Whatever their specific needs, families can "self-tailor" the assistance in ways that provide the greatest benefits for a given cost. Moreover, because vouchers are a fixed amount of assistance, tenants have a strong incentive to "shop around" for the best value, and landlords and developers have the incentive to provide good value to the tenants (which does not happen when tenants must live in designated projects). 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Recognizing these advantages, President Clinton's FY 1996 budget wisely proposed to shift virtually all housing assistance from the project-based form to tenant-based vouchers. Under this plan, HUD would end the multibillion-dollar direct payments to public housing authorities (PHAs) and replace them with indirect support through vouchers that would be provided directly to the tenants now living in these projects. In turn, the tenants could use these vouchers to continue to pay rent to the PHA, rent better quarters elsewhere, or join with other tenants to hire better managers. In any case, PHAs would lose their government-sponsored monopoly status, and instead would have to compete for assisted tenants by offering better service at a competitive price. Confronted with the prospective loss of revenue, PHAs would have no choice but to improve their performance and lower their costs.
<p>
<b>HOW A MISUNDERSTOOD STUDY DROVE A POLICY FLIP-FLOP</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The FY 1996 HUD plan was the most innovative housing proposal in 25 years and relied heavily on both privatization and competitive market forces. But Congress rejected this proposal, and instead drafted new legislation that largely shifted the housing assistance emphasis back to public housing while merely paring back some of the programmatic <I>impedimenta</I> that had accumulated over the 30 years of HUD's existence. In making this decision, both committees said nice things about vouchers but then went on to cite the findings of a June 1995 GAO report<sup>2</sup> that questioned their cost, with the Senate committee stating:
<blockquote><P>
	The Committee believes that a total conversion to a voucher system is a "One-size-fits-all" approach that is not appropriate or will not work in all markets or in all circumstances. For example, a June 1995 study by the General Accounting Office determined that while nationwide the cost of vouchers versus the cost of operating public housing is similar, the averages conceal wide differences in these two options in different market areas.<sup>3</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The House came to a similar conclusion. It acknowledged that on average vouchers were 10 percent cheaper than public housing per household served, but added: "As GAO noted, these wide variations in cost raise a number of important issues.... "<sup>4 </sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The GAO's acknowledgement that sample observations are distributed around their mean (in other words, a bell curve) would hardly have surprised a high school math student, but this commonplace point was sufficiently alarming for both congressional housing committees to reject the HUD reform plan and continue the six-decade reliance on public housing as the primary vehicle for providing assistance to the poor. Yet the findings presented in the GAO report do nothing to support Congress's action; instead, they support the 1995 HUD proposal to "voucher out" the public housing projects.
<P>
<b>WHAT THE GAO REPORT REALLY FOUND</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

One of the reasons HUD recommended a wholesale shift from public housing to vouchers was the significant cost difference in favor of vouchers. As acknowledged in the GAO report, HUD determined "that it cost $440 per month on average to house a family with a housing certificate, compared to an average of $481 per month in public housing."<sup>5</sup>  If spread over the 1.3 million families now in public housing, this difference, described as "similar" by the Senate, would lead to an annual savings of $640 million per year. In turn, if the savings were applied to additional vouchers, Congress would be able to assist another 118,000 poor families now eligible for HUD assistance but unable to obtain it because of limits on HUD funding.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The prospect of a GAO-acknowledged savings of $640 million alone should have encouraged Congress to begin the prompt yet orderly shift recommended by HUD Secretary Cisneros. But the GAO report presents plenty of additional information to demonstrate that the potential long-term savings from shifting to vouchers are even greater than the acknowledged 10 percent. Indeed, the true cost difference may be as much as ten times the amount HUD and GAO presented when a full accounting of all public housing costs is compiled.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

For example, the same section of the GAO report that acknowledges the 10 percent difference also says, in a sentence apparently overlooked by both the House and Senate committees, that "because HUD's analysis considered the capital costs of public housing as sunk costs, it made no attempt to add an imputed debt service charge to the cost of public housing."<sup>6</sup>  <I>In other words, if we assume that public housing costs nothing to build, then public housing has only a 10 percent cost disadvantage when compared with vouchers</I>. The GAO comparison is a classic case of apples and oranges because the cost of the voucher, as related to the rent it pays, embodies all costs, including operating, capital, and debt, as well as other expenses from which public housing is exempt, such as federal, state, and local income taxes, local property taxes, and local licenses and fees. No such costs are included in GAO's representation of public housing's expenses.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Fortunately, the Senate Banking Committee and the GAO provide additional information in their respective reports that can be used to establish a fuller accounting of the costs associated with public housing and allow for a more accurate comparison of these costs with the cost of vouchers. When this is done, it is apparent that, on average, the true cost of public housing is as much as twice the cost of a voucher. 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The search for a more accurate assessment of public housing's costs begins with an estimate of the federal government's investment in public housing, an investment comprised largely of the cost to construct and the cost to renovate and modernize the units periodically as they deteriorate over time. An estimate of this total is included in the Senate report, which states that "the Committee is committed to safeguarding the federal taxpayers' $90 billion investment in the nation's public housing industry.... "<sup>7</sup> 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Combining this $90 billion estimate with the GAO's observation that there are approximately 1.4 million public housing units in existence<sup>8</sup> yields an average per unit historic investment/cost of $65,000. Of course, today's per unit costs are much higher than the average of costs cumulated over past years. HUD estimates current public housing development costs at an average of $88,073 per unit.<sup>9</sup>  For example, HUD has just announced the planned construction of a new project in Washington, D.C., that will have an eye-popping estimated expenditure per unit of $186,500, and a new project in Baltimore entailing expenditures of $340,000 per unit when the cost of other amenities at the project is included.<sup>10</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In order to pro rate this historic $65,000 cost over the useful life of the project, as well as establish an estimate for the costs associated with the debt service charges that would be incurred for this estimated average investment, a useful proxy is the monthly payment associated with a 30-year fixed rate, level payment, fully amortized mortgage. Using an interest rate of 7.5 percent as a conservative average for the government's long-term borrowing rate over the past several decades, this approach yields an additional monthly cost of $454.49.<sup>11</sup>  When added to the HUD/GAO monthly operating cost estimate of $481, this yields a more accurate total monthly public housing unit cost of $935.49, a figure that is more than twice the cost of vouchers. Using the current cost of building a new public housing unit -- $88,073 -- the monthly debt service charge would rise to $615.82 and the total monthly cost of that new unit would be $1,096.82.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

With a cost difference of this magnitude between the two programs, the rationales for the policies embodied in both the housing bills developed by both the Senate and House committees (S. 1260 and H.R. 2406) fall apart. Specifically:
<p><blockquote>
<b>1. Vouchers are by far the better form of assistance. </b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

With full program costs exposed as not "similar," public housing no longer merits the benefit of the doubt, and vouchers no longer deserve the skepticism that characterizes their treatment by Congress. As a result, the policy emphasis in both these bills must be reversed and the burden of proof placed on public housing, not on vouchers. Specifically, vouchers should be the chief vehicle for housing assistance, except when a particular public housing project is not used as a vehicle for racial segregation and can be demonstrated to be less expensive as a result of an independent audit covering <I>all</I> costs.
<p>
<b>2. There are no regional cost differences of consequence once total costs of public housing are included. </b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
If public housing overall is twice as expensive as vouchers, the assertion that there are widespread regional differences in costs is also invalid. When the excluded capital costs presented by the GAO are added, each of the examples which purport to demonstrate the lower cost of public housing actually demonstrates just the opposite; not one of these examples survives the re-estimation.<sup>12</sup>
<p>
<b>3. An independent study commission should be established to settle the cost issue once and for all. </b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

To date, all cost comparison studies have been conducted by institutions, or contractors to institutions, with a vested interest in the outcome of the debate. As a result, and regardless of the quality of the studies, the analysis is perceived to reflect inherent biases, or at least to be tainted with the view of its benefactor. As a congressional agency, for example, the GAO cannot be seen as wholly neutral. The reason: It carries out research according to specific requests from Members of Congress and sometimes is constrained by the requesting lawmaker in the approach it can use to explore issues and evaluate costs. Nor can studies conducted by HUD be seen as free of bias in regard to prevailing HUD policy preferences.
</blockquote><P>
<b>THROWING BAD MONEY AFTER GOOD</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While the cost differences cited above should leave no doubt that all future and incremental housing assistance should be delivered through vouchers for reasons of both cost and quality, there remains the question of how to make the best use of the existing public housing stock, estimated by GAO at 1.4 million units. Although the taxpayers have invested an estimated $90 billion, this sunk cost does not justify any further investment in the system, since spending any additional dollars on public housing reduces by more than half the number of families that can be assisted, when compared with those that could be assisted through vouchers
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Still, investing no more money in public housing does not mean that the existing stock of public housing units has no role to play in an orderly transition from New Deal paternalism to more cost-effective tenant empowerment. In its present state, but under proper management,<sup>13</sup> much of the inherited public housing stock can provide adequate and cost-effective shelter for those in need, and the assisted tenants should be allowed to live there if that is their choice. 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Providing tenants with the choice, and providing <I>them</I> with the funding rather than the landlord, puts tenants in a position to get the maximum benefit from government assistance. Providers of housing, including the public housing authorities, must compete with others in offering quality services to secure their operating revenue, which previously came directly from HUD with no effective requirement that minimal quality standards be met or cost efficiencies established.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

If all public housing operators were funded only by the revenues available from federally assisted rent-paying tenants, financial survival would compel these operators to provide better services. Just as important, tenant-based assistance would force public housing authorities to decide which units to continue in operation and which to close down. Units in extreme disrepair would be rejected by voucher-bearing tenants with the right to choose. Ultimately, they would be shut down, as the federal courts forced HUD to do in Baltimore, and the money that otherwise would be wasted on uneconomic modernization could be used to assist a larger number of beneficiaries directly.
<p>
<b>THE HUMAN COST OF WASTING MONEY </b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

It is important for Members of Congress to keep in mind that federal housing assistance is not an entitlement, and that the level of housing assistance serves only a fraction of the eligible population. As the Congressional Budget Office has pointed out:
<P><blockquote>
	In 1989, the most recent year for which the detailed data used in this study were available, about 4.1 million households received assistance from the federal government in meeting their housing needs. Under the program rules in effect in 1994, almost 14.5 million additional households would have been eligible for aid; that is, their incomes were sufficiently low to qualify them. Not all of the households that were eligible, however, applied for aid, whereas many of those that did apply were placed on waiting lists because sufficient aid was not available.<sup>14</sup> 
</blockquote>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In other words, for every one household served by HUD, more than three eligible ones were not. Thus, within the confines of current budget limits, the money saved through program efficiencies could be reallocated to assist the most needy of the 14.5 million poor yet unserved families now on waiting lists. The per-unit expenditures of $186,500 and $340,000 for new buildings in Washington and Baltimore, noted earlier, represent an egregious waste of money and perpetuate the long waiting lists which characterize HUD programs. 
<blockquote>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Example:</b> If the $115 million that HUD intends to spend to construct just 338 new units in Baltimore was applied to vouchers, HUD could have provided a year's worth of safe and decent privately owned apartments to 21,000 of the 25,000 poor Baltimore families on the housing assistance waiting list.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Given such trade-offs, Congress's continuation of new public housing funding defies reason -- and merely rewards the construction and public housing industry lobbies.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Example:</b> Consider the $2.5 billion that the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on VA, HUD, and Independent Agencies proposes to modernize portions of the existing public housing stock. Had this been allocated directly to certificates or vouchers, this $2.5 billion could have provided needed help to more than 475,000 poor households currently on waiting lists for government housing assistance. 
</blockquote>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While some in Congress may defend this multibillion-dollar modernization expenditure as necessary to provide additional housing units for the poor, the government's own statistics demonstrate that it is a waste of money. According to the government's American Housing Survey (see <a href="bg1081b.html#ahs">box</a>), there are approximately 2.6 million vacant rental units in the United States, and about 39 percent of them, or just over one million, rent for $400 or less per month -- well within the $440 range of the average HUD voucher. About 49 percent, or 1.3 million units, rent for $500 or less, also within HUD's range given that most assisted tenants are expected to supplement the voucher with their own financial resources.<sup>15</sup>  In central cities, the vacancy rate is much higher because of continuing depopulation. 
<P>
<b>MORE AUTONOMY AND LESS ACCOUNTABILITY FOR PHAS</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Although public housing authorities are financially dependent upon the federal government for virtually all aspects of their operations, Congress has not had much success in using the leverage this dependency should provide to induce improved performance. Despite numerous financial concessions, its not-for-profit status, exemptions from all taxes, and exhortations to better management, public housing still costs more than vouchers on a per unit basis.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The difficulties that both HUD and Congress have had with public housing are underscored by the 15 percent of the units under the control of authorities formally described year after year as "distressed."  Although the Cisneros voucher plan would have transferred the hapless tenants in these units to private sector housing and put the poorly managed PHAs out of business, Congress chose instead to rely on modified versions of Washington-managed solutions. Yet, what little management and oversight of public housing there is comes from HUD. And it was Secretary Cisneros's understanding that trying to manage from Washington is not the answer that contributed to his voucher plan to replace failed central planning and management with the discipline of the competitive marketplace. 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Aspects of both congressional committee bills could make this situation worse by diminishing executive branch oversight of the housing industry and key decisions in the choice of assistance. For example:
<ul><p>
<li>HUD's oversight of the PHAs would be diminished by the House committee bill's creation of an independent Housing Foundation and Accreditation Board, comprised largely of the recipients and beneficiaries of federal spending on housing. This board would establish benchmarks for local housing and management authorities, establish procedures for accrediting authorities, and classify authorities. It is through board accreditation that a PHA would become eligible to receive the proposed block grants under this bill. This proposal creates a legislative precedent by turning over executive branch spending authority to an independent board comprised of individuals whose chief qualification for eligibility is the possession of a conflict of interest.
<p>
<li>Both bills move the responsibility for determining the future course of federal housing policy from Congress and the executive branch to the PHAs by granting to PHAs the responsibility for conducting cost comparison studies on vouchers and project-based assistance. The bills then give PHAs the discretion to act on the outcome of their own studies. With so much turning on a single cost comparison, it is hard to understand how Congress can place responsibility for cost comparison studies on the bodies that stand to benefit or lose financially from the outcome of such studies. As recommended earlier, these comparisons should be conducted by a blue ribbon commission of independent experts. 
  </ul><p>
<b>DISTORTING THE PROGRAM TO MAKE IT WORK</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While the taxpayer bears an indirect burden for having his money wasted on poorly conceived programs, the brunt of the failure is born by society's most vulnerable households, including millions of children who are condemned to live in these public housing units or, worse, are denied any housing assistance at all because billions of dollars are wasted on costly and inefficient housing programs. As noted above, the Senate's proposed $2.5 billion modernization program will be at the expense of nearly 500,000 eligible households who will receive no assistance this year because of budget shortfalls in other program accounts.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Added to this is a Republican-endorsed change in public housing regulations that will shift the government's limited housing resources away from the poorest segments of the population by allowing local public housing authorities to "serve residents with a greater range of income."<sup>16</sup>  As the Senate Committee report puts it: "The Committee's bill promotes mixed-income conditions by repealing federal regulations that prescribe strict occupancy preferences and deregulating well-run public housing authorities."<sup>17</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

If these proposed changes are enacted into law, the government's long-standing commitment to use its limited housing assistance funds to help those in greatest need first will be rejected in favor of policies that enforce notions of economic diversity. With 14 million eligible but unserved households, of which about 8.4 million are categorized by the CBO as "very low income renter households,"<sup>18</sup> this policy change, at least on the surface, would appear to be ethically odd. But upon closer inspection, it can be justified by the sort of "burn the village to save it" logic often compelling in the narrow factual confines in which government discourse is engaged.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Although they have not yet been enacted into law, HUD has wasted no time in putting these ideas into practice. In announcing, in early April 1996, a grant of $25 million to build 134 new units (equaling $186,500 per unit) near the U.S. Capitol, HUD also noted that households with incomes as high as $78,430 would be eligible to move into this project.<sup>19</sup>  HUD made no mention of its plans for the 15,983 poor people in the District of Columbia who are on government waiting lists for housing assistance.<sup>20</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

As noted earlier, one of the more serious drawbacks of public housing, and indeed of any government bricks and mortar housing program, is that it serves to segregate households by race and income. By warehousing such large concentrations of the poor, often in deteriorated inner-city neighborhoods where much of the nation's urban public housing is located, Congress has created volatile social environments characterized by high crime, drug abuse, child neglect, and other social pathologies that tend not to occur as frequently with the less costly voucher program that allows assisted households to self-integrate into the community at large. But rather than blame a fundamentally flawed program, Congress blames the victims, and proposes to solve the problem by serving fewer of the poor.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The House committee bill would allow public housing authorities, once compelled to take the poorest and most vulnerable on a priority basis, to rent to higher income families, and would require that no more than 25 percent of a project's units be dedicated to the very poor, characterized as those with incomes below 30 percent of the area's median family income. Expressed another way that better quantifies the human cost of the proposed change, Congress will allow public housing authorities to set aside no more than 350,000 units to serve a population that the CBO estimates at 11.9 million eligible households, of which about 8.4 million receive no housing assistance at all, in part because of programmatic financial limits. With public housing authorities allowed to discriminate against the poor, the worsening situation will likely deteriorate even further.<sup>21</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

However bad some of the housing legislation before Congress may be, there remains the growing possibility that federal courts increasingly will render efforts now underway by Congress and HUD as irrelevant and in violation of the law. As court-directed settlements in Baltimore and several other communities demonstrate, tenants and their legal counsel are becoming increasingly less tolerant of the pervasive <I>de facto</I> segregation that characterizes most of HUD's urban public housing projects, and many of the suburban ones as well. Increased use of vouchers is the only acceptable alternative to the plaintiffs, and to the courts which render the final decision. 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

But as the Baltimore case also demonstrates, decisions by the courts also can be remarkably coercive, and could ultimately be as disruptive and as counterproductive as were the school busing decisions of a past generation. But this need not happen if Congress enacts a new initiative that breaks with past housing policy and the federally financed <I>de facto</I> racial segregation that is an integral part of it. Legislative proposals such as those of Representatives Myrick and Brownback, or HUD's plan of last year, each of which is founded on tenant choice, would be consistent with American principles of civil liberties. In contrast, the legislation produced by the housing committees of both the House and Senate simply entrenches today's disastrous programs and further frustrates reform.

Accordingly, there are no mortgages on public housing or associated debt payments."

<li>    Thirty years was chosen because it is both a conservative estimate and, at present, the government's official estimate of the useful life of structures, as defined by the Internal Revenue Service for purposes of determining allowable depreciation charges.  Given the exceptional wear and tear that the typical public housing unit is subject to, a shorter period of, say, 15 or 20 years would be more reasonable and also would lead to a higher monthly cost estimate.  As for the interest rate, this also allows the analysis to err on the conservative side inasmuch as the average 30-year government bond rate was 9.2 percent for as long as there has been a 30-year bond (since 1977).  Obviously, this too would yield a higher monthly cost.  Alternatively, using the 10-year government bond rate, whose series goes back to 1953, a time span that more closely parallels the construction of today's public housing stock, the average 10-year interest rate is 6.8 percent, and this would yield a monthly debt service cost of  $423.79, making public housing still the most expensive form of housing assistance.<p>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
When President Clinton vetoed welfare reform last year, he also vetoed significant adoption reforms included in the package. Congress will soon take up the adoption issue again in the Adoption and Stability Act of 1996 (<a href="http://rs9.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d104:h.r.03286:">H.R. 3286</a>), sponsored by Representative Susan Molinari (R-NY).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The key component of this bill is a $5,000 tax credit to encourage adoption. This tax relief is phased out gradually for families with annual incomes between $75,000 and $110,000. Beyond ending inequities in interracial and Indian adoptions, the bill also permits employees to deduct from their taxes up to $5,000 in employer assistance for additional adoption expenses. These reforms are financed by changes in foreign trust law and in energy subsidies, both mechanisms also approved by the House and Senate last year.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The $5,000 tax credit, which may be spread out over five years, defrays a significant portion of the costs of adopting a child and is a bargain to taxpayers who now pay an average of $13,000 per year to foster a child.<sup>2</sup>  But the bill still does not allow the credit to apply to payroll taxes, and thus prevents families who adopt but pay less than $1,000 in federal taxes each year<sup>3</sup> from benefiting from the adoption tax credit. These are precisely the families who need help the most.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Ending Discrimination.</b> H.R. 3286 removes obstacles to interracial adoption by penalizing, with a decrease in funding, any state that refuses to allow any person to adopt a child regardless of race or color. It also ends an unjust application of the Indian Child Welfare Act. Today, parents who are totally or partially Indian and have not maintained close contact with their tribe may have the adoption of their child by non-Indian parents blocked. This can be achieved by admitting the child or one of the parents to full membership in the tribe, even after the adoption has taken place. In the future, under H.R. 3286, unless one of the parents maintains a significant affiliation with the tribe, adoption by non-Indian parents may not be blocked.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Other reforms are needed in the adoption and foster care system if the rate of adoptions is to increase. Removing the barriers to adoption in the social service bureaucracy is the most significant of these remaining reforms.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Adoption rates have declined in recent decades as adoption has fallen out of favor with state governments and the social services establishment. In 1979, 598,000 babies were born out of wedlock; almost one in four was adopted. In 1991, of the 1,225,000 born out of wedlock, only one in 25 was adopted (see <a href="bg1080c1.gif">Chart 1</a>). Yet public interest has increased: close to two million couples would like to adopt these children. Clearly, the problem is far more basic than any financial burden that may be involved.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Because of the vast need for adoption and the large pool of parents willing to adopt, Congress not only should encourage adoptions through generous tax relief for adopting parents, but also must change the public social service ethos by eliminating all barriers to speedy and permanent adoption.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The simplest and fastest way to bring about these improvements is to privatize all adoption services. Government agencies have institutional strengths in applying and enforcing the law, but private institutions can better harness the human qualities needed to nurture and develop children. To encourage adoption through private organizations, and to reduce barriers to adoption through government agencies, Congress, the Administration, and the states need to take several important actions.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What the federal government should do:
<P><ul>
<li>Enact a means-tested, fully refundable, inflation-adjusted tax credit of up to $5,000 for non-recurring adoption expenses.
<p>
<li>Hold hearings on the Clinton Administration's blocking of a very effective drug testing and treatment program for cocaine-addicted pregnant mothers. If necessary, pass legislation to reverse the Administration's action.
<P>
<li>Issue annual report cards on the rate of adoption in each state.
<p>
<li>Require federally funded family planning services to provide clear and accurate information on the benefits of adoption to all out-of-wedlock teenage mothers.
<p>
<li>Make it easy for all churches, particularly black churches that serve the poor, to affiliate with adoption agencies and become involved in the adoption process as outreach to prospective adopting parents.
<p>
<li>Ensure the civil rights of all children in foster care and modify the Multi-Ethnic Placement Act to prohibit any use of race or ethnicity to deny or delay the placement of a child for foster care or adoption.
<p>
<li>Change the Indian Child Welfare Act to curtail the reach of Indian Nation law over those who have emigrated from those communities and societies.
<P>
<li>Reject the language in the U.N. Charter on the Rights of the Child.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What the states should do:
<ul><p>
<li>Privatize adoption services.
<p>
<li>Change the way public welfare agencies are financed so that they are obliged to contract for all public adoptions.
<p>
<li>Establish separate units at the county level to assist the courts in making speedy and appropriate judgments.
<p>
<li>Maintain special Medicaid coverage for all special-needs adopted children.
<p>
<li>Remove obstacles to transracial adoptions.
<p>
<li>Use leadership opportunities to encourage adoption.
<p>
<li>Establish separate units for termination of the parental rights of convicted abusing parents.
<p>
<li>Enact a strict 12-month timeline for adjudication of the long-term parental status of every child in foster care.
<p>
<li>Centralize the collection of state data on all formal adoptions and foster care actions.
<P>
<li>Enact legislation subjecting public social service agencies to the same licensing standards and requirements as those imposed on private adoption agencies.
<P>
<li>Mandate drug testing of pregnant mothers suspected of drug abuse, particularly cocaine abuse.
<p>
<li>Prohibit the removal of a child eligible for adoption from foster parents who are willing to adopt, except when the child is being returned to his legal parents. Enact legislation to permit foster parents to initiate adoption proceedings.
<p>
<li>Enact laws requiring child welfare agencies to initiate adoption proceedings for any child who has been abandoned by his parents for six months.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Adoption works. It increases the emotional, physical, and cognitive capacities of the children who are adopted. It improves the life chances of the biological mother. It saves vast amounts of money for the public. It brings much happiness, both to the adopting parents and to the adopted child. It is good for all involved.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The current welfare reform debate in Congress offers one of the best chances in decades to promote adoption. Sharply rising out-of-wedlock births add steadily to the long-range costs of welfare, because being born out of wedlock significantly increases the chances of ending up on welfare. At the same time, up to two million couples waiting to adopt frequently find themselves hamstrung by government agencies and government practices.
<p>
<b>THE NEED FOR ADOPTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Over the past 25 years there has been a dramatic increase in the numbers of children born out of wedlock, children being raised by single parents, families on welfare, and children entering the foster care system because of abuse and neglect. Family disintegration is widespread. There also has been a sharp decrease in the number of children being adopted, with formal adoptions dropping by almost 50 percent: from 89,000 in 1970 to a fairly constant 50,000 annually throughout the 1980s and into the 1990s.<sup>4</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
According to Christine Bachrach, now Director of the Demographic and Behavioral Sciences Branch of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), adoption has declined since the early 1970s primarily because of a drop in the proportion of white mothers who place their babies for adoption. Birth mothers who have continued to place their babies for adoption are more likely to have well educated mothers, are still at school,  have never worked, and are older. Also, they are more likely to place daughters for adoption than sons. Levels of adoption have remained low for blacks and are virtually non-existent for Hispanic women.<sup>5</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Women likely to adopt tend to be married, sterile,<sup>6</sup> and 30 years of age or older. Nearly half of all women with these characteristics have adopted.<sup>7</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The National Council for Adoption estimates that of the 50,000 children adopted annually, 25,000 are healthy children under age two, 10,000 are healthy children over age two, and 15,000 are children with "special needs" (the social work term of art for children considered difficult to place because of their age, physical or mental condition, race or ethnicity, or need to be placed with siblings).<sup>8</sup>  About one-third of these adoptions are arranged by government-funded and government-managed public agencies, some by contract with private agencies. Another one-third are arranged by private, mostly nonprofit agencies, and the rest are contracted outside of agency auspices, mostly through lawyers in private practice. International adoptions accounted for an additional 8,000 adoptions during 1994.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Adoption fell out of favor among social workers during the 1970s, even as single parenthood and abortion became more widespread. Advocates of government-sponsored social programs argued that increases in welfare would make it possible for unmarried mothers to rear children without the assistance of a father.<sup>9</sup>  Yet, as is evident from the skyrocketing foster care numbers<sup>10</sup> and from the chronic problems associated with the absence of fathers, such as crime, poor school performance, poor health status, and low income,<sup>11</sup> that view has turned out to be a tragic mistake. By contrast, children adopted by two parents are doing as well as their peers raised in their own intact families.<sup>12</sup>
<p>
<b>PATTERNS OF PARENTAL NEGLECT </b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The rapid increase of illegitimacy and the staggering problems of children born out of wedlock and raised without fathers are well documented.<sup>13</sup>
<p><ul>
<li>In 1991, 29.5 percent of all births and 68 percent of minority births were out of wedlock.<sup>14</sup>  In 1970, 10.7 percent of all children and 37.6 percent of minority children were born to unmarried mothers.<sup>15</sup>
<p>
<li>In 1986, 66 percent of unintended pregnancies ended in abortion and 33 percent ended with a woman choosing to be a single parent. Only 1 percent ended in adoption.<sup>16</sup>
<p>
<li>In 1992, 659,000 children were in state-sponsored foster care and institutional care for all or part of the year. On any given day, half a million American children live in government-sponsored substitute care.<sup>17</sup>
<p>
<li>In 1982, 7,100 infants were in substitute care outside their homes; in 1988, there were over 17,000.
<p>
<li>In 1991, 2,000 children died from abuse or neglect. Some were murdered. Between 30-50 percent of children killed by their parents or caretakers were known to child protective services before their murders took place.<sup>18</sup>
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There has been a sharp increase in the number of infants abandoned by their frequently drug-addicted mothers. According to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), 12,000 infants were abandoned in 1991.<sup>19</sup>  In response to this crisis, there has been a proliferation of "boarder baby"<sup>20</sup> homes to care for these children until their parents can be located and rehabilitated. A 1993 General Accounting Office report showed that 10,000 infants were being boarded in hospitals for no medical reason. Less than 40 percent of the boarder babies -- and none of the abandoned babies -- were expected to leave in the care of their parents.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The average total cost of caring for these babies in hospital after their medical treatment is almost $13,000.<sup>21</sup>  Nonetheless, only 2.5 percent of the boarder babies and 6 percent of the abandoned infants were expected to go into adoptive placements.<sup>22</sup>  The vast majority of these children will spend years in and out of the foster care system while the biological mother attempts to get her life together.<sup>23</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Federal efforts to deal with this have been small and swamped by the size of the problem.<sup>24</sup>  When Representative Harris Fawell (R-IL) introduced the At-Birth Abandoned Infants Act (H.R. 2936) in 1994 to help move abandoned babies out of the system and into permanent adoptive homes, the child welfare establishment lobbied against it, arguing that creating a two-tiered system -- a fast track for new-born abandoned babies and a slower, less responsive one for older children -- was unfair.<sup>25</sup>  The bill was not enacted.
<p>
<b>WHY ADOPTION SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED</b>
<p>
<b>Benefits for Children</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Adopted children do as well as or better than their non-adopted counterparts, according to a 1994 study by the Search Institute, a Minneapolis-based public policy research organization specializing in questions of concern to states and cities.<sup>26</sup>  This study, the largest examination of adopted adolescents yet undertaken, concludes that:
<p><ul>
<li>Teens who were adopted at birth are more likely than children born into intact families to live with two parents in a middle-class family.<sup>27</sup>
<p>
<li>Adopted children score higher than their middle-class counterparts on indicators of school performance, social competency, optimism, and volunteerism.<sup>28</sup>
<p>
<li>Adopted adolescents generally are less depressed than children of single parents and less involved in alcohol abuse, vandalism, group fighting, police trouble, weapon use, and theft.<sup>29</sup>
<p>
<li>Adopted adolescents score higher than children of single parents on self-esteem, confidence in their own judgment, self-directedness, positive view of others, and feelings of security within their families.<sup>30</sup>
<p>
<li>On health measures, adopted children and children of intact families share similarly high scores, and both those groups score significantly higher than children raised by single parents.<sup>31</sup>
<p>
<li>Adopted children do well at school. In 1981, only 7 percent of children adopted in infancy repeated a grade, while 12 percent of children living with both biological parents repeated a grade.<sup>32</sup>
<p>
<li>Compared with the general child population, children placed with adoptive couples are better off economically. Their parents are better educated and older than the parents of other children.<sup>33</sup>
<P>
<li>Adoptive parents are less likely to divorce.<sup>34</sup>
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Virtually all of these findings have been replicated by Nicholas Zill, Vice President and Director of Child and Family Studies at Westat Research Corporation of Maryland, in his analysis of data from the federal government's 1988 National Health Interview Survey on Child Health.<sup>35</sup>  Results from the survey were compared across four groups: adopted children, children of unmarried mothers being raised by the mother, children of intact families, and children being raised by their grandparents. The data indicated that adopted children:
<p><ul>
<li>Enjoy a quality of home environment superior to all the other groups;<sup>36</sup>
<p>
<li>Have superior access to health care compared to all the other groups;<sup>37</sup>
<p>
<li>Enjoy health similar to that of children of intact families and superior to that of the other two groups; and
<p>
<li>Do better in educational attainment than single-parent children and children raised by grandparents.<sup>38</sup>
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
When compared with those adopted later, born outside of marriage and raised by the single mother, or raised in an intact family, children who are adopted in infancy:
<ul><p>
<li>Repeat grades less often than any other group;
<p>
<li>See mental health professionals less than all other groups, except children of intact families;
<p>
<li>Have better health status than all other groups;
<p>
<li>Have a better standing in their school classes than all other groups, except children raised in intact families; and
<p>
<li>Have fewer behavior problems than all other groups, except children raised in intact families.
</ul><P>
<b>Benefits for Mothers Who Give Up Children for Adoption</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Significantly, teenage mothers who choose adoption also do better than mothers who choose to be single parents.
<ul><p>
<li>They have higher educational aspirations, are more likely to finish school, and less likely to live in poverty and receive public assistance than mothers who keep their children.<sup>39</sup>
<p>
<li>They delay marriage longer and are more likely to marry eventually.
<p>
<li>They are more likely to be employed 12 months after the birth and less likely to repeat out-of-wedlock pregnancy.
<p>
<li>They are no more likely to suffer negative psychological consequences, such as depression, than are mothers who rear children as single parents.<sup>40</sup>
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
All the goals of liberal government programs like job training, supplemental education, and family planning are attained with greater ease, and at lower cost, through adoption.<sup>41</sup>
<p>
<b>HOW MANY POTENTIAL PARENTS ARE THERE?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Although growing numbers of children need adoption, there are more than enough families to meet the demand. The National Council for Adoption estimates that at least one million infertile couples and an additional one million fertile couples would like to adopt.<sup>42</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Christine Bachrach of NICHD concluded from the National Survey of Family Growth that over 2,000,000 women have sought to adopt at one time or another, and about 200,000 were actively seeking to adopt in 1988.<sup>43</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Couples who want to adopt are not looking just for healthy, Caucasian infants, despite assumptions to the contrary. The National Down's Syndrome Adoption Exchange reports a waiting list of over 100 couples who would like to adopt a child with Down's syndrome -- more than enough to accomodate parents who want Down's children given up for adoption. Nor is it difficult to find families for children with spina bifida and children who are HIV positive. For example, the National Council for Adoption is identifying children who will be orphaned when their parents die of AIDS, so that appropriate plans can be made before the parents' death. The response by individuals and families willing to adopt such children has been overwhelming.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Americans are also willing to help with children from overseas, especially because of the anti-adoption bias in the United States. When the communist regime in Romania fell, ABC-TV's "20/20" reported that thousands of children were warehoused in government orphanages. Pictures showed many children with health and developmental problems. ABC received over 25,000 self-addressed, stamped envelopes from people who wanted more information, and within six months 2,000 Romanian children were adopted by Americans,<sup>44</sup> many of whom had not considered adoption until this need became known. This suggests that the pool of parents willing to adopt could be expanded signficantly.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In 1993, over 56 percent of the 7,348 children from other countries adopted by American parents were over the age of one. Of these, 9 percent were between the ages of five and nine, and 5 percent were over the age of ten.<sup>45</sup>  In addition, many of these foreign-born children have physical and emotional problems at the time of their adoption.<sup>46</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Despite the evident readiness and desire to adopt, many families report a lack of support or encouragement from the social services establishment. They report such things as unanswered phone calls, inadequate networking with other agencies which may have children ready for adoption, a disinclination to identify children with needs that correspond to the gifts of the family, and a general lack of support to bring couples successfully through the adoption process.<sup>47</sup>
<p>
<b>THE BARRIERS TO ADOPTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Although adoption meets the interests of the needy child better than any other option, Elizabeth Bartholet of Harvard Law School concludes that "our adoption system has failed to live up to even its own limited vision.... Laws and policies that are supposed to protect children have created barriers to adoption that function effectively to prevent these children from getting the kind of protection they most need 'a loving, nurturing and permanent home.'"<sup>48</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The legal system often resolves cases in ways that trouble many Americans. In two widely publicized recent cases, for example, children were wrested from their adoptive parents on the basis of biological ties. Baby Jessica was given to her biological father, who had failed to support two previous children, and Baby Richard was given to his biological father, with whom he had never lived, instead of being allowed to remain with the adoptive family which had nurtured him from birth for three years. In both cases, the overriding "biological ties" of the fathers prevailed over the needs of their children.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Several barriers make it very difficult for many families to adopt children.
<p>
<b>BARRIER #1: Anti-Adoption Bias in Pregnancy Counseling</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Only 1 percent of women who experience an "unwanted pregnancy" choose adoption for their children.<sup>49</sup>  A University of Illinois study explains some of the causes:
<ul><p>
<li>Some 40 percent of individuals in a variety of settings (health, family planning, social services, and adoption agencies) who identify themselves as "pregnancy counselors" do not even raise the issue of adoption with pregnant clients.
<p>
<li>An additional 40 percent provide inaccurate or incomplete information to clients.
<p>
<li>By contrast, 38 percent of the clients whose counselors offered adoption went on to choose adoption.<sup>50</sup>
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congress's efforts to require adoption information and counseling in one federally funded program providing services to pregnant women have met with resistance from family planning professionals. For instance, the Adolescent Family Life Act<sup>51</sup> was passed in the early 1980s to provide a modest ($7.8 million), more "pro-life," adoption-friendly alternative to the pregnancy counseling provided by established Title X and Title XIX family planning services (typically over $300 million per year). The bias among professionals against adoption can be seen in the evaluation of the program's effectiveness. Some 7 percent of the grantees violated the most basic terms of their grants by not providing any information on adoption to their clients. Most grantees failed to provide either adequate adoption information or counseling.<sup>52</sup>
<p>
<b>BARRIER #2: Misuse of the Foster Care System</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In 1980, Congress enacted P.L. 96-272, the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act. This legislation sought to provide permanent homes for children at risk of abuse and neglect by establishing a hierarchy of services for these children and for their families. In order of priority, these services were:
<p>
1. Family preservation;
<p>
2. Short-term foster care with a goal of family reunification; and
<p>
3. Long-term foster care or adoption.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This legislation requires that each child's situation be reviewed every six months. Within 18 months of opening every case, a permanent plan for the child's future must be in place. This placement plan embodies a decision by the child welfare agency as to whether the child will be returned to the family or placed for adoption. Such decisions and plans must be in place before the work of clearing the child for adoption can be undertaken. Only after both steps have been taken can the search for adoptive parents begin.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
During the 1980s, these permanency planning guidelines evolved into the operating principle of "family preservation" -- keeping families intact through early, intense, comprehensive social services. The goal was to keep families united and thus avoid the high costs of foster care.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Because of their own high costs, however, family preservation services cannot be sustained for long periods; and because of high demand, caseworkers move quickly to take care of the next family in crisis. This approach did succeed in stopping the removal of children from the home, but not necessarily in preserving them from further abuse.<sup>53</sup>  In fact, there is evidence that children fare worse under these new practices. In New York City alone, during the 12 months of 1992, 21 children were killed by a parent or mother's boyfriend after the Child Welfare Administration had intervened.<sup>54</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A study by John Schuerman and his colleagues at the University of Chicago found that the "Family First" program did not realize even its central goal: preventing the removal of children.<sup>55</sup>  Neither did it protect children from further abuse. There is evidence that some families continue to abuse their children even during the period of intensive state intervention.<sup>56</sup>  By contrast, there is strong evidence that children do better when left in foster care than when they are returned to abusive families.<sup>57</sup>  This evidence leads to a simple and commonsense conclusion: children need a permanent home to which they can belong. For children at serious risk, an adoptive home is their best chance for real permanence.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Some child advocates challenge the principle of applying the "family preservation" approach in all cases. At a 1994 conference sponsored by the National Council for Adoption at Boys Town, Nebraska, Dr. Richard Gelles of the University of Rhode Island, a pre-eminent child abuse researcher and an early and optimistic supporter of family preservation programs, presented the following paraphrased views on these practices in light of recent evaluation data:
<p><blockquote>

	There are a now a number of studies of children who were returned home only to be abused again or even killed. These studies show dramatically that some abusive parents cannot be rehabilitated.<sup>58</sup>  In these cases the appropriate care of such a child is to terminate the parents' rights as quickly as possible and place the child with a permanent caring adoptive family.
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Boys Town conference highlighted the central problem of family preservation services. The first logical step should be to assess whether the child should be removed immediately and whether the parents are likely to benefit from support services. Instead, family preservation services are assumed to be the best first treatment. Though these services are activated because of abuse to the child -- sometimes very severe abuse -- they must fail before the child can be protected from the abusing family.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The foster care system is the aggregate network of parents who work for state and local social service agencies by taking abandoned, abused, or neglected children into their homes. They receive a set amount each month with which to feed, clothe, and nurture these children. Foster parents try to function as substitute parents. Prudently, they are admonished not to expect that placement will be permanent. However, from among the couples who take on this work come many who would like to adopt, particularly as they get to know these children and their lack of prospects for a happy and safe life in their families of origin.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Government funding reinforces an anti-adoption bias by supporting "family preservation" programs with free technical assistance and generous grants while providing only restricted support for adoption. The National Council for Adoption and the Institute for Justice report that numerous families, including foster families, have had their attempts to adopt waiting children rebuffed by the social service agencies for whom they work.<sup>59</sup>  Conna Craig of the Institute for Children in Boston reports receiving hundreds of letters from foster parents who are willing and able to adopt their foster children, some of whom have been eligible for years.
<p>
<b>BARRIER #3: Overload and Confusion of Social Service Roles</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
According to Douglas J. Besharov of the American Enterprise Institute, the rising incidence of reported child abuse keeps local child welfare agencies extremely busy on policing activities, diverting time and resources from adoption.<sup>60</sup>  Often the same staff must investigate abuse reports, provide family preservation services, file for the termination of parental rights, and recruit and prepare adoptive families.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The child welfare system typically does not separate the responsibility for terminating parental rights of parents who continue to abuse and neglect their children from the responsibility to help those parents who can be helped. Deaths of children result, as in the cases of the 21 who died in New York in 1992. By contrast, in Arizona and Oregon, separate professional units are used to make initial determinations and to justify the necessary court proceedings. Professionals are not trapped in the role confusion caused by simultaneous demands to reunite every family while also protecting the child.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
If units like those in Arizona and Oregon were in general use, a number of benefits would result:
<P><ul>
<li>Courts could separate those children more decisively and quickly from parents unlikely to reform or benefit from family preservation services.
<p>
<li>Children in danger of severe abuse would be separated more quickly and expertly from their families and made available for adoption.
<p>
<li>Social workers involved in helping the more tractable parents would be free to pursue that work with much less likelihood of endangering the child.
<p>
<li>Local government agencies could turn to the adoption services of nonprofit agencies much more quickly and frequently. Private agencies do not have the immense burden of child protective services and related policing requirements that public agencies have. Their mission is to recruit and prepare adoptive families, and they tend to have great expertise in this work.
</ul><p>
<b>BARRIER #4: Unsatisfactory Protection of Confidentiality</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
State adoption laws generally guarantee the confidentiality of the identity of the mother, the inviolability of the internal intimacy and harmony of the adoptive family, and the peaceful development of the adopted child.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In adoption law and philosophy, there has arisen a view which parallels the modern revisionist view of marriage and parenthood embodied in "no-fault" divorce. New relationships between parent and child are imagined, and a new type of contract is forged between parents. Open adoption is akin to no-fault divorce, and the "birth parents" take on the role of the visiting parent who has not yielded up all his rights to the child, particularly rights of visitation and vacations together. The adoptive parents are bound not just to their adopted child, but also to the birth parents and must facilitate the continuing relationship between the child and his birth parents. This form of open adoption exists in Oregon from birth and in Indiana for children over two years of age.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Open adoption provides no seal of confidentiality regarding the identity of the birth parents, the adopting parents, and the child. It essentially blends birth families with adopting families, directly undermining the creation of a permanent new family for a child. The professional literature shows a frequent confusion of roles when the birth family continues a relationship with the child. This also interferes with parent and child bonding<sup>61</sup> in the adoptive family and inhibits the birth parents' grieving process.<sup>62</sup>  There are parallel experiences and research findings with respect to divorce and the increased risks of being raised in blended families.<sup>63</sup>
Confidentiality, especially in infant adoptions, helps minimize these risks.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Oregon is an example of a state in which open adoption allows birth parents to take adoptive parents to court to uphold visitation agreements. This policy undermines the rights of adoptive parents to make parenting decisions. It also changes the nature and dynamics of a close, intact, inviolably intimate adoptive family, exposing it to the disruptions, conflicts, and anxieties characteristic of divorced and blended families. The professional literature on childhood emotional and behavioral development shows that children of blended families do less well than children of single parents and intact families.<sup>64</sup>  If successful, the growing push for open adoption<sup>65</sup> could cause similar difficulties for adopted children, undermining the generally strong mental health reported by the Search Institute and Nicholas Zill.<sup>66</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Proponents of open adoption even recommend abolishing adoption in favor of "guardianship," which does not offer the same permanency of family for the child.<sup>67</sup>  Like any other government policy which treats the adoptive families differently from intact families, this undermines the very essence of adoption.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Understandably, many children become interested in knowing about their birth parents as they reach early adulthood. Their desire may be fulfilled if everyone involved is prepared to cooperate in lifting the veil of confidentiality. Most states try to maintain confidentiality if there is not full agreement among all concerned. Others do not. Two, Alaska and Kansas, will release the original birth certificate with the names of the biological parents to the adopted person after the age of eighteen, regardless of the birth mother's desires.<sup>68</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Proponents of opening adoption records seek legislation at the federal level. Senator Carl Levin (D-MI) has introduced various versions of a "national reunion registry" to help connect birth parents with persons who are adopted. The National Council for Adoption and many of its affiliated private adoption agencies have challenged the vagueness of the legislative proposals which do not assure confidentiality. They also have questioned the need to federalize a state issue.
<p>
<b>BARRIER #5: Unknown, Uninvolved, or Unmarried Fathers</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Another major barrier for unmarried women considering adoption for their children is the need to obtain the consent of uninvolved fathers. Fortunately the Supreme Court, in a series of opinions,<sup>69</sup> has clarified and restricted the rights of uninvolved, unmarried fathers. According to current federal law, these rights correspond to the effort the father has made to establish a relationship with his child. The unmarried father who is unknown, is uninvolved, or has otherwise demonstrated no responsibility or interest in the child may not be entitled to the same consideration as an involved and responsible unmarried father. Federal courts have ruled consistently<sup>70</sup> that ignorance of a pregnancy is no excuse for uninvolvement, because the father was present at conception and could have followed through to assure adequate care for the child. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A growing trend in state legislatures, upheld by the Supreme Court in <I>Lehr v. Robertson</I>,<sup>71</sup> is the establishment of father registries which make the father responsible for asserting his parental rights. The registry usually requires the father to file a paternity action within 30 days of the child's birth. This will result in his being notified of a pending adoption. He then will have an opportunity to demonstrate that he has tried to establish a relationship with the child and to take responsibility for the child's care. If he fails to meet any of these requirements, he forfeits his rights to contest the adoption of the child, and the adoption can proceed. While many conservatives think an absent unmarried father should never be an obstacle to adoption, this procedure at least frees the mothers to place children without registered fathers for adoption.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The House welfare bill requires paternity establishment at birth for all fathers. This is a major step in the right direction. Fears that efforts to locate unknown, unmarried fathers will slow down, and possibly stop, adoption are unfounded. If the mother is not seeking AFDC support (and she will not if she is placing her child for adoption), she will not need to identify the father. Simultaneously, the putative father registry protects the due process rights of all fathers. Those who do not register, however, cannot benefit from the protection it would have given them.
<p>
<b>BARRIER #6: Race of the Child and Adoptive Parents</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Two forms of racial discrimination take place within adoption: against adoptive parents and against children waiting to be adopted. Potential black parents lose the chance to give their love to needy children of their own race. Black children in foster care are deprived of new parents and a stronger foundation in life, in addition to being exposed to the risks of retarded social and intellectual development. Both forms of discrimination must be eliminated. Fortunately, the means to accomplish this already exist within the private sector. There is no need for coercive race-matching legislation.
<P>
<b>THE SPECIAL PLIGHT OF BLACK CHILDREN</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Interracial adoptions account for about 8 percent of adoptions and consist primarily of adoptions of black children by white parents.<sup>72</sup>  There are more black children waiting in foster care than there are prescreened black families ready to adopt them. With the need for permanent adoptive homes growing more acute and the exit rate from foster care slowing continually, the likelihood of multiple placements for black children increases.<sup>73</sup>  Indeed, some 24 percent of the children in foster care today have been in three or four different homes.<sup>74</sup>  According to Ira Schwartz of the University of Michigan, 53 percent of all children in Michigan who entered the foster care system as newborns are still in foster care at age four.<sup>75</sup>  A number of regional studies confirm this trend and demonstrate that black children typically wait two to three years longer than white children for adoptive homes.<sup>76</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The length of stay in foster care is very important. The longer the newborn stays in foster care, the more at risk he is of approaching the "difficult to adopt" age and the greater the problems associated with long-term foster care become. If half the children who arrive in foster care at birth are still in it at age four, the system is not serving their needs.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This statistic highlights the need for termination units -- specialized units of social workers who work with the courts to determine whether the parental rights of an abusing or neglectful parent should be withdrawn so that the child may be placed for adoption. If the "best interest of the child" principle is used, this decision will be made quickly. If the "family preservation" principle is used, the decision will be delayed again and again, often until repeated neglect convinces the authorities that parental rights must be removed. At this point, in addition to having suffered even more, the child is older and more difficult to place.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Given these figures, public welfare agencies are a major source of neglect of young black children. The bias against adopting early, when the child is most adoptable, feeds the foster care system and ensures a larger clientele for public agencies. The present system of financing foster care and not financing adoptions perversely rewards this form of government neglect.
<p>
<b>Black Families and Adoption</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There is some evidence that blacks adopt at a much higher rate than whites if one controls for family structure, income, and age of parents.<sup>77</sup>  A 1983 Department of Health and Human Services study78 put these comparable rates at:
<p><ul>
<li>7 adoptions per 10,000 black families for all black families;
<p>
<li>2 adoptions per 10,000 white families for all white families; and
<p>
<li>2 adoptions per 10,000 Hispanic families for all Hispanic families.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Controlling for age of parents (below 55), family income (above poverty level), and family structure (intact families), the rates change to:
<p><ul>
<li>18 adoptions per 10,000 black families within the range;
<p>
<li>4 adoptions per 10,000 white families within the range; and
<p>
<li>3 adoptions per 10,000 Hispanic families within the range.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

These figures convey the reality of much higher adoption rates among blacks than among whites or Hispanics for children in public welfare agencies who are available for adoption.<sup>79</sup>  There is, however, conflicting evidence that white women were more likely to make adoption plans than black women.<sup>80</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

To meet the needs of all children within their own racial communities by placing them in couple-headed families above poverty, the same study suggests that the response rate among black families would have to be far higher than it is. It would need to approach 44 per 10,000 families for blacks, compared with 6 per 10,000 families for whites and 6 per 10,000 families for Hispanics. This would require an enormous increase in the rates of adoption by blacks and Hispanics. Richard Barth of the School of Social Welfare at the University of California at Berkeley sums up the conclusions to which these data lead:
<blockquote><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	The growth of African-American adoptions have increased by 92% in the last 5 years and Hispanic adoptions by 80%. The growth of African American adoptions would have to grow four times faster than that during the next five years in order to give African American children parity of access to adoption. For Hispanic children, the growth rate would have to double for their opportunity to be adopted to reach parity with Caucasian children.<sup>81</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

To achieve these levels of adoption will require a great community effort by black and Hispanic people.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

As well-run private agencies demonstrate, large pools of adoptive parents can be developed over time. Even pools of parents for "harder to place children" can be developed when the effort is made by a committed organization. For instance, Down's syndrome children are adopted quite quickly because there is a network of screened parents in place and ready to adopt. Similarly, a pool of parents ready to adopt HIV-positive babies has been developed by the National Council for Adoption.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In a 1980 study of black parents, sociology professor Robert Hill of the Institute for Urban Research at Morgan State University estimated that three million black households are interested in adopting children. This translates into one hundred black families for every black child in foster care waiting for adoption.<sup>82</sup>  Given this potential, a pool of prescreened adoptive parents big enough to take care of the needs of black children represents an achievable goal.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The private sector can best develop this pool because private organizations are motivated to do so. Building pools of parents is not the strong suit of public agencies.<sup>83</sup>  Some private organizations in the black community have achieved remarkable results. Recently, for instance, in just one year, Detroit's Homes for Black Children placed 132 children in black homes -- more than all the other 13 child welfare agencies in the city.<sup>84</sup>  To increase the rate of adoption within black families, the leadership of the black community should commit itself strongly to using private organizations.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Although the emphasis should be on making it easier for black families to adopt, blocking transracial adoptions just because the children are black and the parents are white discriminates against many needy black children because of race. Moreover, it does not increase the rate of in-race adoption. California, despite a law requiring a 90-day search for a same-race family before a child can be adopted across racial lines, still has twice as many black children as white children waiting for adoption, often for long periods.<sup>85</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Institute for Justice last year filed suit on behalf of a white foster couple who had cared for a black child since birth. When the child became eligible, they sought to adopt him but were blocked by the public welfare agency because they were not black. Even when black parents were not found, the agency persisted in blocking this adoption. No one can argue that this was in the best interest of the child.<sup>86</sup>  Similar racial discrimination prevented the adoption of a white child by a black couple who had fostered the child since birth. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In 1984, liberal black columnist Carl T. Rowan argued against the "abominable notion that race must be the dominant factor in deciding who can deliver loving care and protection to a child."  Rowan equated the position of black social workers who support only in-race adoption with a 1954 statement by a segregationist Mississippi editor that "every child has the right to be educated among children and by teachers of the same racial background."<sup>87</sup>  Furthermore, according to professor Rita Simon, sociologist at the American University and expert in transracial adoption, "The data in our studies and indeed in all the studies that have been done show that transracial adoptions serve the children's best interests."<sup>88</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Still, opposition to transracial adoption is strong. When former Senator Howard Metzenbaum (D-OH) steered S. 1224 through Congress in 1993, he did so to outlaw obstacles similar to the above restrictions that exist in most states. But the Clinton Administration, which supports race matching, succeeded in changing the legislation so that lack of race matching could be used to deny or delay a placement.<sup>89</sup>  Instead of encouraging solutions, such as private adoption agencies that specialize in placing black children, the Administration's policy aggravates the problem.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Bunning Amendment, incorporated into the House-passed welfare bill, repeals the Clinton policy. Senator John McCain (R-AZ) had a similar amendment (S. 637) to the Senate version of the welfare reform bill. The Children's Defense Fund supported the Clinton Administration's approach,<sup>90</sup> despite the evidence of researchers such as Rita Simon, who shows that transracial adoption does not damage the child emotionally or developmentally and that transracially adopted children do just as well as those adopted by parents of their own race.<sup>91</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Race matching can be achieved easily if there are enough prescreened adoptive parents. The difficulty lies not in the lack of parents but in the poor track record of public agencies in building a pool of black adoptive parents.
<p>
<b>THE NEED FOR FEDERAL LEADERSHIP</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

A child's needs are best served, and his potential fostered most effectively, by the love and sense of belonging provided by a stable family environment. As in other areas of social concern, however, the government's ability to increase love and dedication is limited. This competence resides primarily with the family, the church, and the school. However, through their power to enact wiser laws and provide leadership, lawmakers at the federal level can affect the rate of adoption. They can expound upon its benefits for the child, for the mother who gave birth, and for the parents who adopt.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Adoption is one of those rare good solutions to many thorny problems. Political leaders should help the country realize that it is one of the most effective ways to alleviate the problems arising from illegitimacy, child abuse, and neglect.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Lawmakers also must challenge the leaders of other major institutions, especially church leaders, to talk about the goodness of adoption. Educational leaders, particularly in social studies areas, ought to be challenged to develop good materials on adoption. Health insurance leaders ought to be challenged as well, for adoption is a less costly solution to infertility than is fertility treatment, which averages about $35,000 per course of treatment. Media leaders ought to harness their expertise in communications to promote adoption to the nation at large, instead of attacking it.<sup>92</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The more this is done, the more attractive adoption will be to growing numbers of families. America also needs to celebrate parents who adopt and parents who care for foster children -- especially those who both foster <I>and</I> adopt. They show a double generosity.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Adoption is a national resource that should be encouraged and expanded by government where possible. The federal government should undertake a public relations campaign, targeted to girls under the age of 18 who have conceived out of wedlock, on the benefits of adoption. In addition, Congress should:
<P>
<b>1)  Enact a means-tested, fully refundable, inflation-adjusted tax credit of up to $5,000 for non-recurring adoption expenses.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress permits a tax deduction for the medical costs of fertility treatment (typically between $35,000 and $50,000 for testing, test tube conception, and deep freeze, development, and discard). The average revenue loss for such treatment is about $8,000. Some corporate health plans, the costs of which are fully excludable from employees' taxable income, also cover fertility treatment. By contrast, the Treasury would gain financially from a one-time $5,000 tax credit that encouraged parents to assume the total cost of caring for foster children -- each of whom now costs taxpayers over $13,000 each year.<sup>93</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This tax credit should be fully refundable (including against Social Security taxes) so that poorer parents who adopt a child receive the same level of support as those who earn more and have larger tax liabilities. The object is to encourage and support those who want to adopt. Being less generous with poorer parents (and more black parents are poor compared to white parents) is unwise because it reduces the incentive to adopt.
<p>
<b>2)  Hold hearings on the Clinton Administration's blocking of an effective drug testing and treatment program for cocaine-addicted pregnant mothers. If necessary, pass legislation to reverse the Administration's action.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The high incidence of serious child abuse among drug-addicted mothers inflicts pain and damage on cocaine-addicted babies. With some 350,000 children affected each year, there is an obvious need for a change in federal law to permit the testing of mothers suspected of cocaine addiction. These babies are at high risk for foster care and for severe damage to their health and development.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

South Carolina Attorney General Charles Molony Condon ran a successful program of testing, mandated treatment, or a jail sentence if the mother refused treatment. The result was dramatic: the incidence of cocaine-addicted mothers fell from 24 per month in Charleston to five or six per month.<sup>94</sup>  The Clinton Administration, however, called the program punitive and racially discriminatory and threatened to cut off all federal reimbursements to the hospital involved, effectively threatening to shut down the program and discouraging other states interested in replicating the Charleston model.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress should take steps to reverse this Administration policy. The use of cocaine by pregnant women is a major factor in the death or severe damaging of many thousands of cocaine-affected newborns.
<p>
<b>3) Issue annual report cards on the rate of adoption in each state.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To redress the poor quality of national data on adoption and foster care, Congress should instruct the Department of Health and Human Services to issue comparative report cards on the performance of each state in a number of areas concerning the family condition of children, including:
<p><ul>
<li>The number and rate of out-of-wedlock births,
<P>
<li>The rate of adoption,
<p>
<li>The length of stay in foster care, including information on the longest stays,
<p>
<li>The typical period between the availability of a child for adoption and the child's adoption, and
<p>
<li>The typical period between the beginning of foster care and the agency's finalization of a placement plan (decision regarding the future of the child).
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Dissemination of such information will keep state residents better informed and help encourage agencies to find children good, permanent homes.
<p>
<b>4)  Require hospitals and clinics receiving federal funds for family planning services to provide clear and accurate information on the benefits of adoption to all out-of-wedlock teenage mothers.
</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress should require HHS to contract with pro-adoption experts for the writing and distribution of an appropriate brochure on the benefits of adoption for both mother and child. Congress then should require that this brochure be distributed in all hospitals which receive federal funding, either directly or indirectly, and in all federally funded family planning clinics, and that the staff of such hospitals and clinics draw attention to this material.
<p>
<b>5)  Make it easy for all churches, particularly black churches that serve the poor, to affiliate with adoption agencies and become involved in the adoption process as outreach to prospective adopting parents.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

One of the best ways the federal government can help these churches is by providing an incentive for members to adopt more children waiting in foster care. The full refundability of the $5,000 tax credit will do much to effect this. Unless their members are able to pay most of the normal costs of adoption, there is little likelihood that black churches in poor neighborhoods will be involved. With the tax credit and with church involvement, however, the probability of an increase in adoption is significantly greater.
<P>
<b>6)  Ensure the civil rights of all children in foster care and modify the Multi-Ethnic Placement Act to prohibit clearly the use or consideration of race or ethnicity in denying or delaying the placement of a child for foster care or adoption.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The fundamental principle behind all civil rights is equality of rights and equal treatment under law. A young child without a family cries out for as quick a placing as possible within a caring family, so that his long-term human potential may not be thwarted at critical early stages of development. The "personness" of that child is infinitely more important than his or her "blackness," "Indianness," "Hispanicness," or "Asianness."  In cases where parents of similar ethnic background are unavailable within, say, a 90-day period, then those who are available and willing to adopt should be united with the child, both for the child's benefit and for the good of society.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Those who are anxious to have the children of a community adopted within that community must ensure a sufficient supply of parents wanting to adopt. The onus is on the community and ought not to be placed on the waiting child. To help assure a pool of parents, Congress should work with states to streamline and simplify adoption procedures in minority communities.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Many opportunities for developing a pool of waiting parents are available. The network of minority churches is extensive. By linking with private adoption agencies, these churches can help respond to the needs of minority children awaiting adoption. Many other ethnic organizations can be harnessed to bring the pool of minority adopting parents up to the level needed. The press could carry public service announce-ments in minority communities. Minority fraternities and sororities also could play an important role. These and similar community efforts would raise public consciousness about adoption.
<p>
<b>7)  Change the Indian Child Welfare Act to curtail the reach of Indian Nation law over those who have emigrated from those communities and societies.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While fully respecting the right of Indian nations to regulate adoptions within their territories, and while fully respecting the rights of all Indian parents giving up their children for adoption to request that the Indian nations take these children for adoption, Congress ought to change civil rights law so that the rights of Indian or part-Indian parents living outside the nations' territories are upheld.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Under current law, a child with as little as one sixty-fourth Indian ancestry may be under the control of that Indian tribe for adoption, no matter where the child lives. While the number may be modest, the principle of "personness" again is paramount. Just as a foreign-born American citizen is not subject to the adoption laws of his country of origin, an Indian who has chosen freely to leave the Indian nation and to marry someone outside it should no longer be subject to its laws. H.R. 3286 addresses this issue well.
<p>
<b>8)  Reject the language in the U.N. Charter on the Rights of the Child. </b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This charter could preclude adoptions for millions of children over time and deny U.S. couples the option of adopting foreign children. The unsigned U.N. Charter on the Rights of the Child may come before Congress in the near future for ratification. In the current draft, international adoption is declared to be a last option, after the home country has exhausted its search.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As in cases of transracial and race-matching adoption, each nation has a responsibility to assemble a pool of prescreened adoptive parents if it has children waiting to be adopted. If a nation does not have such a pool, and yet blocks couples from abroad from adopting, that nation is neglecting its children. The United States should be on the side of the child rather than on the side of governments that seek international acceptance of some specious "right" to neglect their nation's children.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

If the language of the U.N. Charter on the Rights of the Child is accepted by Congress, it could mean an end to most international adoptions. The Hague Convention, to which the United States is a signatory, and which guides present policies, is superior though far from sufficient. Its guiding principle is that care in a family is better for a child than care in an institution.
<p>
<b>WHAT THE STATES SHOULD DO</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Because regulating adoption is a state function, most of the practical reforms must be enacted by state legislatures. And because of the particular need to address the transracial adoption issue in a just and caring fashion, the states must take special care to eliminate discrimination against black adoptive parents and black children.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

To increase the pool of available parents to fill the needs of all children, states should encourage the privatization of adoption. Specialized agencies can work constructively with those sections of the community that are willing to serve the many different needs of children: black children, older children, children with special medical problems, and children with other emotional or developmental difficulties. As different groups already have demonstrated, it is possible to line up a pool of screened and qualified parents more than willing to adopt children with even the most difficult needs.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

One effort, started by Fr. George Clements in Chicago in the mid-1980s, had each church set about achieving the adoption of one child within the congregation.95  Though initially the program received wide publicity and had some impact, it has not become a sustained and organized national effort. However, in Florida, One Church, One Child of Florida has developed a successful partnership between church and state. Between March 1988 and September 1990, this organization placed 805 black children in adoption.<sup>96</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Phoebe Dawson, a social worker who heads New Beginnings, a licensed nonprofit adoption agency in Columbus, Georgia, has been very successful in this work. For instance, an agency in Cleveland, Ohio, was not able to find minority parents for a young minority child, leaving the child at serious risk of a protracted wait for adoption. One worker at the agency contacted New Beginnings, which was able to resolve the problem quickly because of its close ties to black Baptist churches across the country.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To encourage adoption, states should:
<p>
<b>1)   Privatize adoption services.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Private adoption services are more efficient and more effective than state agencies where adoption is concerned, as illustrated by the track record of Detroit's Homes for Black Children. They are accountable to a board of directors, while state agencies are not. Private organizations may be sued, which increases their accountability to the children and parents they serve. By contrast, state agencies often cannot be sued. Furthermore, people are more inclined to donate money, time, services, and goods to a private adoption agency than to pay taxes for government agencies.
<p>
<b>2)  Change the way public welfare agencies are financed. </b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Public welfare agencies dealing with children receive more money to keep children in foster care than they do to clear them for adoption. States should make the allocation of Title IVE monies to these agencies contingent on their record in making final determinations on the future status of children within 12 months of entering foster care. Those not returning to their families must be adopted within three months or handed over to a private agency for adoption.
<p>
<b>3)  Establish separate units at the county level to assist the courts in making speedy and appropriate judgments. </b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

These units should make the initial decision whether to terminate the rights of the parent and bring the process to court or return the child to his family. All babies under 12 months of age coming into the protective custody of a public welfare agency should be processed through the termination unit as a matter of course. A great many such children should be placed for adoption quickly. This in turn would prevent the buildup of a large number of children in foster care -- children who grow more and more difficult to place with each passing year, as the significant drop in the percentage of older children who get adopted clearly indicates.
<p>
<b>4)  Maintain special Medicaid coverage for all special-needs adopted children. </b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This makes it possible for many middle and low-income families to adopt a sick child they would not be able to care for without Medicaid support. It makes sense for government to provide this support, for the special-needs child in foster care will cost the government even more.
<p>
<b>5)  Remove obstacles to transracial adoptions. </b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While working to increase the pool of minority parents and to enhance the flow of prequalified and ready-to-adopt minority parents, states should continue the practice of transracial adoption when no same-race parents are available. When the child becomes ready for adoption, his need is immediate and acute. Minority community groups can monitor the pool of prescreened, qualified minority parents for all the relevant categories of children: older children, older male children, sibling groups of children, medically needy children.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In addition to the issues involved in ending discrimination against black children waiting to be adopted and against black couples waiting to adopt, there is much else to be done by the states.
<p>
<b>6)  Use leadership opportunities to encourage adoption.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Governors and state legislatures should consider mounting campaigns to increase interest in adoption. With the prompting and advocacy of the Institute for Children in Cambridge Massachusetts, the State of Massachusetts, under Governor William Weld's direction, embarked upon Assignment Adoption, a series of government reforms to reduce the number of children in foster care and to increase the practice of adoption.
<p>
<b>7)  Establish separate units for termination of the parental rights of convicted abusing parents.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

When the difficult duty of assessing the appropriateness of terminating parental rights is commingled with the mandate to preserve the family at all costs, the good of the abused child suffers. The long-term good of the child is helped by establishing separate units of social workers who help the court reach clear and speedy decisions regarding the parents' right to continue as parents. These workers can help the courts without the conflict of interest that is present when they also try therapeutically to help the family come together or stay together. It is best that such work be carried on by a different set of professionals. The best interests of the child remain paramount while the effort to help the parent is vigorously pursued.
<p>
<b>8)  Enact a strict 12-month timeline for adjudication of the long-term parental status of every child in foster care.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

A University of Chicago study finds that children who enter foster care as infants remain in the system 22 percent longer than other young children.<sup>97</sup>  Within a 12-month period, the court and the termination unit should decide whether a child should be returned to his parents or placed for adoption. Continuance in foster care beyond that time must be regarded by all as a failure to provide properly for the needs of the child. To be lax or negligent in this matter is to be guilty of serious child neglect.
<p>
<b>9)  Centralize the collection of state data on all formal adoptions and foster care actions.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In order to facilitate the practice of adoption and the reduction of foster care lengths of stay to the minimum time needed, the collection of accurate data is critical. At present it is poor and varies greatly in quality between states. National leaders, national and state campaigns to encourage adoptions, and the stimulation of executive action to initiate and maintain reforms all require an accurate picture of what is happening to children in adoption and foster care. The state Office of Vital Statistics or its equivalent ought to be the repository of all adoption information, and the state Office of Human Services or its equivalent ought to be the repository of all foster care data.
<p>
<b>10) Enact legislation requiring of public social service agencies the same licensing standards and requirements as those now imposed on private adoption agencies.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Just as Congress has passed a law (H.R. 1 and S. 2) to subject itself to the same regulations it imposes on the rest of the country, all state agencies involved in adoptions ought to be subject to the same reporting and regulatory oversight as adoption agencies are. This reform will likely have the speedy effect of reducing these regulations to the bare minimum needed for the good of the child.
<P>
<b>11) Mandate drug testing of pregnant mothers suspected of drug abuse, particularly cocaine abuse.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Because of the high incidence of serious child abuse among drug-addicted mothers, because of the pain and damage done to cocaine-addicted babies, and because this condition now affects 350,000 children a year, states should push for a federal law permitting the drug testing of mothers suspected of cocaine addiction so that hospitals may participate in such programs without being threatened with a cutoff of federal funds as happened in the South Carolina case discussed above.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Children born to drug-addicted mothers are at risk for a host of difficulties and abuses: lower birth weight, physical abuse, and not getting the affectionate nurturing critical for early attachment formation and its concomitant long-range benefits, among them the formation of a solid conscience and the ability to relate well with others. Given these risks to the child, the requirement of drug testing when cocaine or crack cocaine ingestion is suspected is an appropriate protection.
<p>
<b>12) Prohibit the removal of a child who is eligible for adoption from foster parents who are willing to adopt the child, except when the child is being returned to the legal parents. Enact legislation to permit foster parents to initiate adoption proceedings.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

If the parents are deemed by the agency as suitable for fostering the child, they should qualify automatically as suitable for adopting the child. Today, many foster parents are willing to adopt the children they have fostered once they become available for adoption. However, mainly because of the effective prohibition of transracial adoptions, these parents frequently are denied the chance to adopt the children who have become attached to them. These couples should have the right to adopt the child once the courts have decided he may be adopted. If child welfare agencies have not made this possible within six months of the court decision, foster parents ought to be granted the standing in law to sue the adoption agency and initiate adoption proceedings.
<P>
<b>13) Enact laws requiring child welfare agencies to initiate adoption proceedings for any child who has been abandoned by his parents for six months.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This rule should apply for any child in out-of-home care for six months whose parent has not engaged in meaningful interaction with the child during that period. Due process in the courts will protect the rights of parents barred from contact with their children due to very unusual circumstances. However, a child left alone for six months is a child without a dedicated parent.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

More and more of the nation's children are at risk of child abuse and neglect as rates of illegitimacy rise. Their plight merits the generous response of dedicated people. Few responses can match the depth and devotion entailed in adopting a child. This dedication reduces a host of problems for the nation: the costs of extended foster care, the poorer health and slower development of children in foster care or in the home of neglectful and abusing parents, and the higher incidence of addiction, crime, and dependency.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Adoption increases the emotional, physical, and cognitive capacities of the children who are adopted. It improves the life chances of the biological mother. It saves vast amounts of money for the taxpayer. It brings much happiness to the adopting parents. It is good for all involved.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Adoption works.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

By vetoing the adoption legislation passed last year, President Clinton defeated the most significant reform in the practice of adoption to be seen in decades. Sharply rising out-of-wedlock births add to the long-range costs of welfare, because being born out of wedlock significantly increases the chances of ending up on welfare. As this pool of needy children grows, all too often, up to two million couples waiting to adopt are frustrated in their efforts.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The need is great and the solution is obvious: adoption. Yet government agencies and practices actively discourage this solution which, unlike present policies, could help solve a major national problem while also reducing both welfare dependency and long-range costs. The situation cries out for reform. The suffering of the children cries out for reform.

An Attributional Analysis," <I>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</I>, Vol.  48, No.  4 (1985), pp.  1054-1066.  An interesting anomaly has emerged from an analysis of adoption studies.  Clinical studies traditionally have shown adopted adolescents to be overrepresented in psychiatric settings.  The same occurred here, but these adolescents were found not to have emotional or psychological problems at these rates.  Adopted adults are less likely to receive treatment than the general population.  This seeming contradiction occurs because adoptive parents are more likely to refer their adopted children for possible treatment.  Of all adopted children referred by parents for clinical treatment, only 27 percent had a clinical diagnosis.  The remainder -- almost 75 percent -- received counseling for normal adolescent issues.<p>

The fact that the exit numbers of minority children are smaller than those of white children will result in additional increases in the proportion of minority children in care.  If current trends continue, minority children will become the clear majority in the nation's substitute care population in the next few years.
