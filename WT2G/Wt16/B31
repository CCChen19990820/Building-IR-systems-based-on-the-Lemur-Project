<TITLE>Top 10 Best and Worst Primetime TV Shows</TITLE>

<center><h2>Top 10 Best and Worst Primetime TV Shows</h2></center>
<P>
 MRC research has shown that while the number of prime time series
containing gratuitous sex and obscene language has increased,
wholesome shows are also gaining strength. The MRC's Entertainment
Division recently released its &quot;Top Ten&quot; list of the
least family-friendly prime time shows, but also named several
programs which respect family values and are appropriate for audiences
of all ages. 
<P>

<P>
 This report, which has been distributed to thousands of journalists
-- including television critics from print publications and television,
and radio talk show hosts, is the culmination of thousands of
hours of television analysis. As of press time, this annual season-end
tally has received widespread coverage in several major media
outlets, including <I>USA Today</I>,<I> The Washington Post</I>,
<I>Los Angeles Times</I>, and was even included in Jay Leno's<I>
Tonight Show</I> monologue. 
<P>

<P>
<CENTER><h3>The Top Ten Least Family Friendly shows, in ranking
order:
</h3></CENTER>
<P>
1.<I><B>Married...With Children</B></I> (Fox) Sunday 9:00 p.m.
EST
<P>
 The crudest comedy on prime time television, <I>Married</I> routinely
ridicules the family. Every week members of the &quot;Bundys&quot;
trade insults, celebrate promiscuity, and revel in bathroom humor;
this raunchfest's dialogue is peppered with lewd punch lines about
sex, masturbation, the gay lifestyle, and the lead character's
fondness for pornographic magazines and strip clubs.
<P>
2. <I><B>Friends </B></I>(NBC) Thursday 8:00 p.m. EST
<P>
<I> Friends</I> has not toned down its adult content despite the
show's shift to the earlier 8 o'clock hour. Virtually every episode
revolves around sexual themes and contains inappropriate language,
and each of the six central characters, all single twentysomethings,
is sexually active. Additionally, the sitcom promotes gay parenting
and same-sex marriages as viable options.
<P>
3. <I><B>Roseanne</B></I> (ABC) Tuesday 8:00 p.m. EST
<P>
 Like<I> Friends, Roseanne</I>'s move to the 8:00 pm time slot
has done little to mitigate the show's content. The series' central
characters are openly derisive of their parents; religion and
the religious are mocked; foul language is frequent; premarital
sex is condoned; and  gay marriage is championed.
<P>
4. <I><B>Melrose Place</B></I> (Fox) Monday 8:00 p.m. EST
<P>
<I> Melrose</I>'s randy regulars are constantly in and out of
one another's beds, engaging in premarital and extramarital sex.
Prime time's sexiest soap also showcases the gay lifestyle, with
one gay character gaining a live-in lover this season.
<P>
5. <I><B>A Season in Purgatory</B></I> (CBS) Miniseries
<P>
 Based on a Dominick Dunne novel, <I>Season</I> showcased members
of a supposedly devout Catholic family promoting their faith in
public while privately engaging in a vast array of premarital
andextramarital affairs, rape, murder, and scandalous cover-up
schemes. 
<P>
6. <I><B>Central Park West</B></I> (CBS) Wednesday 9:00 p.m. EST
(Canceled)
<P>
 One of the most hyped entries on last fall's schedule, <I>CPW</I>
condoned premarital sex and adultery, and aired scenes containing
foul language and explicitly sexual content. Fortunately, the
acting and writing were so poor that very few viewers tuned in
to its sordidness, and it was canceled.
<P>
7. <I><B>The Dana Carvey Show</B></I> (ABC) Thursday 9:30 EST
(Canceled)
<P>
 The popular comedian shocked viewers and sponsors with obscenity-laden
skits and extremely crude content. After many advertisers withdrew
their support and ratings began to wane, ABC pulled the show off
the air.
<P>
8. <I><B>Cybill</B></I> (CBS) Sunday 8:00 p.m. EST
<P>
<I> Cybill</I>'s storylines frequently test the limits. Dialogue
is littered with foul language, sexual innuendo, and suggestive
scenarios. The sitcom's regulars frequently belittle the institution
of marriage. Casual sex -- even among teenagers -- is condoned.
<P>
9. <I><B>Beverly Hills, 90210 </B></I>(Fox) Wednesday 8:00 p.m.
EST
<P>
 While one character has steadfastly refused to lose her virginity,
other members of <I>90210</I>'s tanned and trendy cast have been
more than happy to promote premarital sex as a natural -- and
completely inconsequential --  fact of college life. The teen-targeted
soap sends mixed messages on drugs: positive characters deride
substance abuse, but rarely address the illegality of drug use.
<P>
10.<I><B> Martin</B></I> (Fox) Thursday 8:00 p.m. EST
<P>
 The sex lives of the two newlywed protagonists and their single
friends serve as fodder for the raunchy humor pervading this sitcom.
Most of <I>Martin</I>'s episodes contain dialogue fraught with
sexual references and obscene language.
<P>
<BR>

<center><h3>The Most Family Friendly Shows</h3></center>
<P>
 The Most Family-friendly shows on prime time contain wholesome
subject matter for viewing by all ages. These prime time offerings
include:<BR>

<P>
<I><B>Touched By an Angel</B></I> (CBS) Saturday 9:00 p.m. EST
<P>
 One of CBS' few success stories of the season, <I>Touched By
An Angel</I> is the most outspoken proponent of traditional values
on the prime time schedule. The inspiring drama showcases God's
message of unconditional love, illuminates the power of prayer,
and promotes compassion and strengthening family ties.
<P>
<I><B>Second Noah</B></I> (ABC) Saturday 8:00 p.m. EST
<P>
 This mid-season replacement about a novelist, his veterinarian
wife, and their eight adopted children is one of prime time's
most pro-family offerings. Storylines depict respect for parental
authority as the key to a strong family unit, and advocate premarital
chastity, individual responsibility, and faith.
<P>
<I><B>Kirk</B></I> (WB) Sunday 8:30 p.m. EST
<P>
 The cornerstone of WB's family-friendly line-up, every episode
of <I>Kirk</I> reiterates the importance of family. The title
character, a young man suddenly charged with the upbringing of
his three younger siblings, willingly makes many personal sacrifices
to ensure that the children are receiving a sound moral upbringing.
The show imparts the merits of hard work, faith, patience, and
taking responsibility for one's actions.
<P>
<I><B>Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman</B></I> (CBS) Saturday 8:00 p.m.
EST
<P>
<I> Dr. Quinn's</I> promotion of traditional values has endeared
it to audiences of all ages. Marriage and family are staunchly
promoted, as are honesty, compassion, and respect for parental
authority. The drama boasts one of prime time's most positive
clerics -- &quot;the Reverend,&quot; a series regular, is depicted
as an intelligent, caring, and very dedicated member of the community.
<P>
<I><B>Home Improvement</B></I> (ABC) Tuesday  9:00 p.m. EST
<P>
 This popular sitcom remains a reliable family staple. Focusing
primarily on the relationships between a cable TV host, his wife,
and their children, <I>Home Improvement</I> has taught valuable
lessons about teenage drinking, honesty, respect and the importance
of education. One of prime time's foremost advocates of the institution
of marriage, the show frequently addresses the challenges faced
by the husband and wife and the steps they take toward strengthening
their relationship. 
<P>
<I><B>Lois &amp; Clark: the New Adventures of Superman</B></I>
(ABC) Sunday 8:00 p.m. EST
<P>
<I> Lois &amp; Clark</I> abandoned the suggestive dialogue and
sexual references of its 1993-94 inaugural season, and, in the
words of series star Teri Hatcher, is now &quot;the family show
to watch.&quot; The show's cleverly scripted storylines prove
that television needn't appeal to the lowest common denominator
to provide quality entertainment: dialogue and fast-paced action
sequences are free of offensive language and sexual innuendo,
and the newly-engaged protagonists promote premarital chastity.
<P>
<I><B>The Parent 'Hood</B></I> (WB) Sunday 7:30 p.m. EST
<P>
 Another winning offering from WB, <I>The Parent 'Hood'</I>s central
characters provide positive role models for viewers of all ages.
The happily-married African-American couple, both successful professionals,
teach their children that education, self-discipline and integrity
are keys to success. The positive impact of a father in the household,
family loyalty, and postponing sex until marriage is also underscored.

ABOUT THE PARENTS TELEVISION COUNCIL
</center></h2><br><p><b>
"Bringing responsibility to television programming"</b>
<P>
The Parents Television Council (PTC) was established in 1995 as a special project of the 
Media Research Center to bring America's demand for values-driven television programming to 
the entertainment industry.
<P>
The PTC offers private sector solutions to restore television to its roots as an independent 
and socially responsible entertainment medium. Much of the PTC's success stems from urging 
the public to voice its support of family-friendly programming to network executives, 
advertisers, and public policy leaders. The PTC has employed these efforts to help save values- 
driven shows such as ABC's <i>Second Noah</i> and CBS's <i>Touched By An Angel</i>.
<P>
Along with empowering the public to voice their concerns, the PTC organized a star-
studded group of industry leaders to become members of  the Parents Televisions Council's  
Advisory Board. These spokespersons address issues relating to television entertainment and its 
impact on families across America.
<P>
More information on the PTC can be found in its flagship publication, the <a href="/mrc/entertainment/95famgui.html">1995-`96 
Family Guide to Prime Time Programming</a>, the only comprehensive study of prime time's 
content available in America. Profiling every sitcom and drama on ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC, UPN 
and WB, the <i>Family Guide</i> provides viewers with information on subject matter that is 
inappropriate for children while also identifying shows which promote family-friendly themes.
<P>
For more information on the Parents Television Council, or to simply give us your 
feedback on today's prime time programming, please <a href="mailto:mrc@mediaresearch.org">e-mail</a> us.

<p>
Dear Mr. Harbert, Mr. Moonves, Mr. Matoian, Mr. Littlefield, Ms. Salhany, and Mr. Kellner:
<p>
     Until recently, the major networks set aside the first hour 
of prime time for family programming. This timeslot featured such 
wholesome series as <i>Happy Days</i>, <i>Little House on 
the Prairie</i>, and <i>The Cosby Show</i>; adult-oriented fare was relegated to the late evening hours.
<p>     
This voluntary covenant with the viewing public has disintegrated to the point where the former Family Hour now features sitcoms and dramas promoting promiscuity and obscene language.
<p>     
We, the Members of the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives, urge you, the leaders of the 
major commercial broadcast networks, to recognize the pernicious effects of this programming on our children and voluntarily 
return to the spirit of the Family Hour. By creating a safe haven for the family viewing audience, and resolving to dedicate one 
hour of prime time programming to the promotion of positive values, the entertainment industry would not only endear itself to 
parents, but also immeasurably benefit American society.

<TITLE> Restoring Family Hour </TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY bgcolor="#ffffff">
<blockquote>
<h2><center>Restoring the Spirit of The Family Hour</h2></center>
<P>
The Media Research Center's campaign to restore the spirit of the "Family Hour" has had impressive results. 
<P>
In April, the MRC organized a bi-partisan coalition of United States Senators and Representatives who challenged the television networks to voluntarily bring back the spirit of the Family Hour. Over 70 members of Congress signed a letter urging network entertainment executives to voluntarily broadcast only shows advocating positive family values during the first hour of prime time. The letter appeared as a full-page ad in the show-business newspaper <i>Daily Variety</i>.
<p> 
MRC Chairman L. Brent Bozell followed up with a May 7 letter to ABC entertainment president Ted Harbert asking him to renew the highly acclaimed family drama <i>Second Noah</i>, which debuted this past February and whose future was undecided.
<P>
The advertisement and the letter had demonstrable results: On May 20, ABC announced that <i>Second Noah</i> was on its fall schedule and would air Saturdays at 8 p.m. EST. Subsequently, the show's creator and executive producer, Pamela Long, enthusiastically thanked Bozell and the MRC, writing that the <i>Daily Variety</i> ad "struck just the right chord. And Ted Harbert...heard you loud and clear."  	
<P>
Brandon Tartikoff, then the chairman of New World Television, <i>Second Noah</i>'s production company, has also recognized the MRC's work on the program's behalf. Tartikoff told Flash, the MRC's monthly membership newsletter, that "support by Brent Bozell and his joint efforts with members of Congress...not only influenced ABC's decision to pick up the show, but also influenced the placement of <i>Second Noah</i> on Saturday nights, among the best times for family viewing."

<P>
<I>Dear Friend,<BR>
<P>							

After spending weeks predicting the Republicans' chances of holding on to their majorities in Congress were shaky at best, the media completely ignored their stunning comeback on Election Day. <BR>
<P>

Think about it. Big Labor, according to <b>The Wall Street Journal</b>, spent nearly $500 million in a savage, year-long campaign of distortions and outright lies, to defeat the Republicans. Their primary targets were the conservative freshmen in the House; the unions were out to destroy them. <BR>
<P>

Other left-wing special interests, from Hollywood to wacky environmentalists, spent millions more. Topping it off Bill Clinton and Al Gore lied in the national debates, in nationwide advertisements, and in hundreds of speeches, constantly endorsing conservative issues they'd actually vetoed! <BR>
<P>

It was, to my thinking, the most dishonest campaign I've ever seen. <BR>
<P>

So, where was the national press holding the Clinton campaign accountable for all the distortions and lies? Why didn't the national media expose the fact that 35% of union members voted Republican - yet union bosses forced them to pay for the anti-GOP ads? Where were the investigative reports on Clinton scandals by the television networks? Nowhere. The left wing so-called "objective" media did nothing to expose this fraud. <BR>
<P>

Why? Maybe because the media themselves have been promoting the very same anti-GOP distortions while actively pushing for Clinton's re-election. <BR>
<P>

This election not only proved to be an egg-on-your-face embarrassment for the unions and bureaucrat-hugging environmentalists, it was an embarrassment for the media.  Conservatives survived in the House, even increased their numbers in the Senate. <BR>
<P>

This past year we've updated you on our <a href="/mrc/reality/"> Media Reality Check '96 </a> campaign to hold the media accountable for their lies and distortions. Thanks to all your support, our campaign reached millions of Americans daily through newspapers, magazines, and talk radio. Because of our campaign, some reporters are now -- finally! --  admitting there is a liberal bias in the media. Even Walter Cronkite is admitting what he denied for 30 years. "Everyone knows that there is a heavy liberal persuasion among correspondents." <BR>
<P>

It took Walter Cronkite 30 years to figure out what we've known for 30 years. <BR>
<P>

Over the next few months, you can bet the networks will continue to ignore the many Clinton scandals that are currently under investigation. And the MRC will continue to expose the media's lies and distortions, throughout Clinton's second term. <BR>
<P>

For the past several weeks our <a href="/mrc/news/"> News Division </a> has been aggressively reviewing four years' worth of media reports on Clinton scandals, and the stories the networks have never bothered to air. There have been countless investigative stories in <b>The Wall Street Journal</b>, <b>The Washington Times</b>, even the liberal <b>Washington Post</b> and <b>Los Angeles Times</b>. And still there's been silence from the networks. When the study is done, and I give you the results, you are going to be amazed by the media cover-up, I promise. <BR>
<P>

A study like this is a huge undertaking - nothing like this has ever been done. We are going to prove once and for all the media helped deliver Clinton to the White House - not once, but twice - by refusing to report the truth. <BR>
<P>

I invite you join us by becoming an <a href="/mrc/membership/membership.html.cgi">MRC Member </a>.  Help stop the media's lies and distortions. <BR>
<P>

By becoming a <a href="/mrc/membership/membership.html.cgi">Member</a>  you'll receive MRC's monthly membership newsletter <a href="/mrc/membership/flash.html">Flash</a> , which details our studies, research, and projects. Other  <a href="/mrc/membership/benefits.html">Membership Benefits </a> include updates from me, discounts on all our books and publications - up to 50% off, and much more. <BR>
<P>

Through our web site we are offering <a href="/mrc/membership/membership.html.cgi">Free Membership</a> for six-months! <BR>
<P> 

The work of the Media Research Center is more important than ever. Become a member today, and join us in our efforts to neutralize and expose the media's leftist attacks on conservatives. <BR>

<img src="/mrc/images/pattern.gif" align="right">The explosive new book <i><b>Pattern of Deception</b></i> assembles a mountain of evidence proving how the liberal media, especially the television networks, have promoted the Clinton agenda, both during his campaign and his presidency.<p>

You'll learn:

<ul>
<li> Which TV producer bragged about setting up Clinton's campaign public relations while working for ABC.

<li> How the media campaigned to discredit Gennifer Flowers, Paula Jones, and Troopergate.

<li> How Clinton lied about being drafted -- and how the networks virtually spiked it.

<li> Which <i>Time</i> editor misled readers about Clinton being drafted -- and eventually landed the # 2 job in the State Department.

<li> Which <i>Washington Post</i> reporter compared Clinton to Jesus Christ.
</ul>

"In <i><b>Pattern of Deception</b></i>, you'll read how the press have given the Clinton administration a free ride on policy issues which are far more important to the future of liberalism than personal peccadilloes."<br>
-- Cal Thomas<p>

"The liberal media have the power to set the national agenda, and <i><b>Pattern of Deception</b></i> proves that this is just what they're doing."<br>
-- L. Brent Bozell III<p>

"Must reading for the GOP."<br>
-- Arianna Huffington<p>

<html><head><title>Revolving Door for January 1995 Media Watch</title></head><body bgcolor="#ffffff"><blockquote><center><h2>Revolving Door for January 1995 Media Watch</h2><p><h3>Revolving Door Spins More for Clinton Administration than Bush's</h3></center>A Very Comfortable Relationship<p><dd>As Bill Clinton's nomination became secure in 1992, former Newsweek reporter Mickey Kaus predicted reporters would be rewarded. In the May 11 New Republic he wrote: "Many pro-Clinton journalists can reasonably hope for something more than glamorous candlelight dinners in the Clinton White House. They can hope for jobs in the Clinton White House."<p><dd>A MediaWatch study of this "revolving door" has proven Kaus prophetic. In just two years, more than twice as many members of the media have joined the Clinton administration (33) as jumped to the Bush team in four years (15). The study counted those with influence over news coverage at a national media outlet who left to take a politically appointed slot with the administrations.  Those who decided to join Clinton's team held higher profile or more influential media slots than did those whom Bush attracted: <p><dd>While no on-air network TV reporter joined the Bush team, so far six have taken Clinton jobs. <p><dd>Ten network producers, executives, and researchers have made the jump to Clinton's staff, compared to just three during the Bush years.<p><dd>Another 13 major newspaper and magazine reporters hopped aboard the Clinton team while just eight put in a stint for Bush.    In alphabetical order, here are the revolvers listed with their administration title and dates of service, followed by their media position. <p>Clinton Administration:<p><ol><li>Kevin Anderson: Health care spokes-man, White House public affairs office, 1993USA Today Money section reporter<li>Kenneth Bacon: Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs, 1994-Wall Street Journal Washington bureau reporter, 1969-1994<li>Donald Baer: Director of White House speechwriting and research, 1994- U.S. News & World Report Asst.

<CENTER><H2>The Free Market Project</H2></CENTER>
<P>
The Free Market Project is the business and economics arm of the Media Research Center. The Project 
analyzes both the entertainment and news media to determine how they portray the free enterprise system. 
The Project engages in three main activities: 
<p> 
<ol> 
<li> <a href="/mrc/medianomics/"> MediaNomics </a>, a monthly four-page supplement to<a href="/mrc/mediawatch/"> MediaWatch </a>. MediaNomics reports on how the 
national media cover business and economics. Each issue includes an in-depth study of media coverage of 
a particular economic issue, such as the flat tax, minimum wage proposals, or Medicare reform. Every 
month MediaNomics commissions a prominent free-market economist to write an essay about how the 
media could improve their coverage of a particular economic issue. 
<p> 
<li> Quarterly Breakfast Forums. Every few months, the MRC's Free Market Project hosts a breakfast 
forum at the National Press Club for reporters. Each forum features a prominent conservative economist 
and policymaker, who give the media their side of the story on an issue in the news. In March, for instance, 
presidential candidate Steve Forbes talked about the flat tax and how reporters ought to cover it. 
<p>
<li> Joint Projects. The MRC's Free Market Project is also a vehicle for other conservative organizations or 
industry groups to analyze and criticize the press. Currently, the MRC is involved in a joint project with 
Consumer Alert, which will determine whether there is an anti-free market bias in large-circulation 
consumer publications. 
</ol> 
<p> 
The work of the MRC's Free Market Project has had a wide influence, being quoted in the Harvard 
Business Review, Inc., Investor's Business Daily, The Wall Street Journal, and USA Today's "Money" 
section, among many, many other publications. It is the only organization devoted solely to analyzing 
media coverage of business and the economy. 
<p> 
<p>

Each month MediaNomics points out such glaring omissions in the news. To subscribe to MediaNomics 
and MediaWatch, visit the <a href="/mrc/bookstore/bookstore.html">MRC Bookstore </a>.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br>
November 21, 1996<br>
<P>
<center><h1> Women's Magazines: A Liberal Pipeline to Soccer Moms </h1></center><br>
<P>
<P>
<P>
	High-circulation women's and family magazines use most of their ink to focus on lifestyle issues -- relationships between dating and married couples, parenting, home decorating, fashions and personal care, and dieting.  Surprisingly, many also deal with public policy issues relating to government activism and women's and families' health and safety.<BR>
<P>
	A joint <a href=" http://www.his.com/~calert"> Consumer Alert </a> / <a href="/mrc/about/ "> Media Research Center </a> study of 13 women's and family magazines analyzed the October 1995 through September 1996 issues for their policy-oriented coverage.  Part I of the study reviewed whether expansion of government programs was depicted positively or negatively.  Part II looked at the magazines' depiction of risk in discussing public policy issues relating to health and safety.  The study found: <BR>
<P>

<LI>In the 13 magazines studied, there were 115 positive portrayals of government activism and/or calls for more.  There were only 18 negative portrayals and/or calls for less. <BR>


<LI>Twenty-three stories went beyond promoting bigger government -- they also asked readers to lobby government officials on behalf of expanded government programs. <BR>


<LI>In 56 articles or mentions of science and risk issues, 35 were one-sided and did not acknowledge a skeptical view that the risks depicted were minor and the alarmist views presented go against mainstream science. <BR>

<LI>According to women's magazines, recycling is always good.  Out of 15 stories that mentioned recycling, there was not one skeptical argument presented that sometimes recycling is impractical and wastes resources. <BR>

<LI>Women's magazines featured numerous warnings about unsafe drinking water, yet routinely bashed chlorine as unsafe, even though chlorine provides the most effective protection against waterborne diseases. <BR>
<P>

	Recommendations:  Look for balance in coverage of public policy issues.  Note who the spokespersons are for a particular point of view.  Is there a pattern in who is depicted as the good guys (or gals) and bad guys?  Be skeptical of articles that provide only anecdotal information instead of scientific evidence. <BR>
<P>
<P>
<b><h2>Part I: Calling for a Village</h2></b><br>
<P>
 "Soccer Moms." This term struck as much fear into the hearts of conservatives during the 1996 election campaign as "Angry White Men" did in liberals in 1994. Conventional wisdom has it that the limited-government policies of the GOP just did not resonate with these suburban housewives, creating a gender gap that cost Bob Dole dearly at the polls.<BR>
<P>
Why the apparent skepticism among women towards smaller government, especially since in some polls they strongly favor reducing taxes and cutting wasteful spending? Perhaps at least part of the reason can be found in a joint Consumer Alert/Media Research Center study of the publications that Soccer Moms read. Each month, as they perused the pages of their favorite magazines, women were not merely learning new recipes, the latest diet ideas, and how to have better relationships with their husbands or boyfriends; they were also often being told that government was the solution to most of society's problems, and they were being urged to lobby for its expansion. <BR>
<p>
For the study, Consumer Alert and the Media Research Center analyzed the October 1995 through September 1996 issues of thirteen family and women's publications -- <i>Better Homes & Gardens, Family Circle, Glamour, Good Housekeeping, Ladies' Home Journal, Mademoiselle, McCall's, Parents, Prevention, Redbook, Weight Watchers, Woman's Day, and Working Woman</i>.<BR>
<p>
Overall, there were 115 positive portrayals of government intervention in the market and/or calls for such intervention during the study period. There were only 18 negative portrayals of government intervention and/or calls for cutbacks in government spending or regulation. There were five balanced portrayals of policy issues. <BR>
<p>
Working Woman</i> and <i>Glamour</i> were the most biased in favor of expanding government. Each had 24 positive portrayals of government activism compared to four negative portrayals. <i>Good Housekeeping</i> was next with 15 stories promoting bigger government and only three stories promoting smaller government.<p>
Ladies' Home Journal</i> was the most politically balanced magazine in the study. Although the monthly ran ten stories promoting bigger government, it also ran six promoting limited government and ran four balanced stories. Two of the magazines, <i>Better Homes & Gardens</i> and <i>Prevention</i>, almost completely avoided public policy issues during the study period. <BR>
<p>
<b>Health Care.</B> Health-related issues brought forth the most calls for government intervention. There were 28 such stories. Seven focused on "drive-through deliveries," in which insurance companies didn't pay for women to stay in the hospital for longer than one day after giving birth. <i>Good Housekeeping </i>warned that "tiny lives are at risk" and advised readers on "how you can help stop this shocking practice." The magazine provided a form readers could send to Congress to demand regulations extending hospital stays. <BR>
<p>
Seventeen stories demanded increased federal funding for medical research into everything from AIDS to obesity to breast cancer, with no mention of how this new spending would be paid for. It didn't seem to matter because, according to <i>Woman's Day</i>, women had a "right" to quality health care. Liberal journalist Margaret Carlson, writing for <i>Glamour</i>, argued that families did too. Republican Medicare reform efforts, she wrote, would hurt the party with women: "If Granny gets booted out of the nursing home for lack of Medicare funds, it will be the woman of the house who picks her up." <BR>
<p>
Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs), and managed care in general, took a beating in family publications. There were nine stories about the horrors people had faced at the hands of heartless health care bureaucracies. None of these stories discussed the health care reform option many market-oriented reformers promote -- Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs). MSA advocates argue that such accounts would put health care dollars in the hands of consumers, giving them an incentive to find bargains and employ preventive medicine. A search of the EBSCO Publishing database found that there were no mentions of MSAs in these magazines during the study period; other magazines mentioned MSAs in 121 articles. <BR>
<p> 
Instead of discussing the problems of systems relying on third-party payers, women's and family magazines often proposed expanding such systems. In the September <i>Glamour</i> freelance writer Tessa DeCarlo urged readers not to "give up on universal coverage...No reform of managed care can be completely successful as long as more than 40 million Americans don't have any health coverage at all." She also wrote that laws should be changed to encourage more medical lawsuits. <BR>
<p>
<B>Urging Readers to Lobby.</b> Twenty- three stories went beyond merely promoting bigger government as the solution to problems; they also asked readers to contact Congressmen or other government officials to lobby on behalf of bigger government. <i>Good Housekeeping</i> provided form letters ("Join the <i>Good Housekeeping</i> Lobby") that merely needed a signature. After a June, 1996 story about Christopher Reeve and his life since his equestrian accident, for instance, <i>Good Housekeeping</i> provided a letter to Senator Arlen Specter, chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations. The letter told Sen. Specter: "Please add my name to the list of supporters of increased funding for spinal cord injury (SCI) research during fiscal year 1997." <BR>
<p>
Other publications, while not going to such elaborate lengths, nonetheless prodded readers into lobbying for bigger government. Three stories highlighted the "These Children Have Faces" campaign. Under the headline "Has Congress Put Children in Danger?" the May <i>Glamour</i> told readers that the group's founders "devised a plan to let politicians know that children's allies are watching: They're collecting photos of young people, with notes about their parents' fears and hopes, and will deliver the pictures to Congress next month." <i>Glamour</i> advised its readers on how to participate. <BR>
<p>
In a November 1, 1995 <i>Woman's Day </i>story about osteoporosis, <i>Woman's Day </i>told readers to "urge your members of Congress to work for more women's health research funding."<i> Woman's Day's </i>Dr. Loraine Stern, who writes the "Your Child's Health" column, wrote: "If you agree that immunizations should be fully covered for all children in need, tell your insurance company and<F255D> your representatives in Washington." In March, Weight Watchers alerted readers to a new advocacy group, the American Obesity Association, whose "first priority is to lobby the federal government to spend more money on obesity research." The magazine then told readers how to get in touch with the group to help. <BR>
<p>
The September <i>Mademoiselle</i> explained the nuts and bolts of writing a letter to Congress, using the example of a group called 20/20 Vision, which claims to have halted an "environmentally disastrous" plutonium-processing plant through a letter-writing campaign. The October, 1995 <i>Mademoiselle</i> urged 20-somethings to vote, strongly implying that they should support a liberal agenda. "The Contract with America, tax breaks for the rich, the end of public TV -- was this what my fellow Gen-Xers wanted? It's impossible to know, because most of us didn't vote," wrote freelance writer Esther Gabara. <BR>
<p>
<B>Promoting Liberal Activists.</b> Well-known liberal activists and political figures were profiled or prominently mentioned 18 times by these magazines. Marian Wright Edelman was the clear favorite, being promoted in<i> Family Circle, Good Housekeeping, Mademoiselle Parents</i>, and <i>Working Woman</i>.<i> Family Circle</i> seemed particularly enamored with the Children's Defense Fund (CDF) founder, mentioning her on four different occasions. The November 1, 1995 "From the Editor" section featured a prayer drawn from Edelman's latest book; the May 14 issue gave Edelman the magazine's "Lifetime Achievement Award" for such accomplishments as increasing Head Start funding; the June 4 issue promoted Edelman's "Stand for Children" march in Washington. And when the editors of <i>Family Circle</i> picked the 25 best-selling books "that can change your life," a recent Edelman book made the list. <BR>
<p>
<i>Good Housekeeping</i> also promoted Edelman's "Stand for Children" march on Washington; <i>Parents</i> editor Ann Pleshette Murphy pointed out with pride that Edelman won that magazine's first "As They Grow Award," and <i>Mademoiselle</i>, in a sidebar to a September article about poverty, urged readers to send a check to the CDF and provided the group's address. At no point did any of these publications question Edelman's policy prescriptions. They could have pointed out, for example, that Census Bureau statistics show that child poverty went down every year between 1983 and 1989, when Ronald Reagan's policies, which Edelman opposed, were in effect. But no critic or criticism of Edelman was mentioned. <BR>
<p>
Some magazines had regular features to highlight liberals. <i>Glamour</i>'s "Women in Washington" column, for instance, reported on the work of female representatives and senators -- but usually only the ones who were working to expand the role of government. One month, the column praised a host of female legislators for increasing funding for child care "during last year's bitter welfare debate." Another column expressed relief that "while members of Congress were slashing funding for almost all federally funded programs last fall and winter, Congresswomen from both parties managed to engineer a triumph for breast-cancer programs." In July, 1996, the column praised Sen. Nancy Kassebaum and Rep. Louise Slaughter for expanding regulation in health care. <BR>

The magazines also promoted the liberal agenda by quoting "authorities" from liberal activist groups. <i>Weight Watchers</I> for instance, promoted the views of the Ralph Nader-founded Public Citizen Health Research Group in a May story warning about databases of medical records maintained by insurance companies to evaluate risk. No other counter-source was quoted. <i>Woman's Day</i> gave kudos to the World Wildlife Fund for protecting rhinos from poachers in Nepal, yet didn't mention private property approaches to wildlife preservation that, for instance, have increased elephant herds dramatically in Zimbabwe, where hunting is permitted as a property right and villagers have incentives to protect their property. <BR>
<p>
Liberal activists themselves often wrote stories for these magazines. Edelman wrote an essay for <i>Parents</i> to promote her Stand for Children march. Representative Pat Schroeder explained to <i>Glamour</i> readers why she was leaving Congress, even though she was "proud to be the sponsor of many bills that helped women and children, including the Family and Medical Leave Act, the Women's Health Equity Act, the Violence Against Women Act, and the Women's Economic Equity Act." <BR>
<p>
<I>Prevention</i>, which usually shied away from outright political stances, nonetheless allowed space in its October, 1995 issue for Hillary Clinton to tout government-run health care. "Taking steps to protect our children's health is one of the soundest investments our nation can make," the first lady opined. "President Clinton has initiated a campaign to improve immunization services, lower costs, reach out to families and ensure that all young children receive the vaccinations they need. In addition, Medicaid has provided millions of young children with important preventive health services." <BR>
<p>
Two staffers at the magazines even became liberal activists for a time, attending the United Nations' World Conference on Women in Beijing. "What hit me...was the passionate belief shared by women everywhere that we have a <i>right</i> to good health care," wrote Dr. Marie Savard, who penned the "Your Health" section of <i>Woman's Day, Ladies' Home Journal</i> editor-in-chief Myrna Blyth also attended, writing that the evening after Hillary Rodham Clinton's speech, the American delegation "got into a large circle, held hands and sang some sixties-style folk songs." <BR>
<p>
There were some conservative and/or Republican women profiled by these magazines, but their political views were often challenged instead of celebrated. Liberal journalist Eleanor Clift, for instance, profiled New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman for the November, 1995 <i>Working Woman</i>. While the story was generally upbeat, Clift took a shot at Whitman's tax-cutting policies: "In order to cut income taxes by 30 percent, she has increased long-term borrowing, reduced payments to public pension funds and cut state aid to local governments. The ripple effect of those steps is yet to be fully realized." <BR>
<p>
Republican women would often be praised...when they worked to expand the role of government. Senator Nancy Kassebaum, for example, was chosen as one of <i>Glamour</i>'s "Women of the Year" for working to ban assault weapons, for expanding regulation of health care, and for, in general, not being "extreme." <BR>
<p>
On a more balanced note, <i>Good Housekeeping</i> devoted the back page of each issue to an essay by former Reagan speechwriter Peggy Noonan. But Noonan rarely mentioned public policy issues in her essays. <BR>
<p>
<B>Lost Opportunities.</b> There were numerous stories in which the case that big-government policies hurt consumers, families, and women could have been made, but wasn't. Many articles eagerly announced that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had just approved a new drug or medical device. The November 1, 1995 <i>Family Circle </i>reported that "the FDA has approved the drug Caverject, which treats impotence, a condition affecting as many as 20 million men." This, the headline declared, was "good news for couples." While it may indeed have been good news for couples at the time, <i>Family Circle</i> didn't mention those who had been suffering before the FDA had gotten around to approving the treatment. <BR>
<p>
Only <i>Good Housekeeping </I> condemned FDA policy. The magazine's February, 1996 issue took the agency to task for not allowing the breast cancer Sensor Pad onto the market. "Women are not stupid," writer Laura Muha declared. "They ought to be able to decide whether this is something they want." But <i>Good Housekeeping</i> didn't ask if other life-saving products were being held up by the FDA. <BR>
<p>
Another lost opportunity: taxes. There were nine major stories about financially strapped families and the stress this caused family members. <i>Parents</i>, for instance, labeled the dilemma: "Mommy guilt vs. economic reality." Only one of these stories mentioned the rising tax burden on families. Even that one didn't point out what the Tax Foundation found: that taxes take more from a family than food, clothing, and housing costs combined. No story urged readers to lobby Congress for tax cuts, as these magazines had done for more liberal policies which allegedly would help families. <BR>
<p>
These magazines also ignored the regulatory burden on women. Only one article, in <i>Ladies' Home Journal</i>, pointed out that regulations hurt small business owners, many of whom are women. The September issue of that magazine profiled a woman who had owned a garbage-hauling and recycling business, but was forced out of business because of the high costs of government regulation. No story all year pointed out that, according to the Small Business Administration, government regulations cost almost $7,000 per American household, or how such regulations raise the prices of the products women and families buy. <BR>
<p>
And stories about safety didn't point out that often government policies undermine the safety of consumers. The April, 1996 <i>Better Homes & Gardens</i>, for instance, reported that "the larger your car, the less likely you are to be hurt if involved in an accident. That's the not-so-shocking conclusion of an insurance claim analysis for 1992-1994 models." But the magazine didn't then point out that federal fuel economy regulations encourage smaller, and therefore more dangerous, cars. <BR>
<p>
<B>"<i>Redbook</i> Strategy."</b> The Clinton campaign understood what an asset it had in family and women's magazines. It pursued, according to <i>U.S News & World Report</i>, a "<i>Redbook</i> strategy" aimed at courting the demographic group to which most of the readers of women's and family magazines belong. <i>Redbook</i> editor Kate White, in an article about "Why you're the White House's secret weapon," wrote that she was "flattered." But the magazines themselves, by promoting big government, had laid the groundwork for such a strategy to be successful. In doing so, they often misled their readers -- or didn't give them the whole story -- about the downside of government activism for women and families.<BR>
<p>
<P>
<b><h2>Part II: Scaring Women to Death</b></h2>
"Gender plays ... a powerful role in perception of hazards." That was the conclusion of Professor John Graham of the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis after the center polled more than 1,000 Americans to find out whether they believe in widely reported, but unproven, "hazards." Graham found that women were more likely to believe such scares were true by margins of 10 points or more, but he couldn't figure out why. "Some suggest that because women give birth, protect, and care for their children, they may naturally tend to be more nurturing than men, therefore they may be more concerned about hazards that may harm their families," Graham speculated. "Another possible explanation is that women are less familiar with science and technology than men, and are generally more fearful of it, especially in relation to nuclear power and chemicals." But Graham ended up concluding that "the role of gender in risk is more profound than can be explained by either the 'nurturing' or 'worldview' hypothesis" and that "more research is needed to understand why gender plays such a powerful role in perception of hazards." <BR>
<p>

One explanation Graham did not explore is that the reporting about risks in women's magazines may play a role in how women perceive those risks. After all, many women read these magazines not just for recipes and marriage advice but to receive important information about their own and their families' health. In a 1995 survey conducted by the American Dietetic Association, 80 percent of the female respondents said that women's magazines were a valuable source of information for them about nutrition. Overall, women's magazines ranked above TV news, newspaper articles, and even nurses as valuable sources of nutrition information. <BR>
<p>
 
Some advocacy groups already recognize that women's magazines can be a valuable ally in promoting their ideological agenda. In <I>Science Under Siege</i>, Michael Fumento reported that public relations agent David Fenton arranged interviews months in advance with magazines such as <I>Woman's Day</i> and <I>Redbook</i> to hype the scare he was orchestrating about the pesticide Alar that has now been widely discredited by respected scientists. The magazines readily complied with Fenton in 1989 with headlines such as "The Foods that Are Poisoning Your Child" (<I>Redbook</i>) and "Are Pesticides Poisoning  Our Children?" (<I>Woman's Day</i>)<BR>
<p>

Mainstream media outlets are not above running alarming stories about unproven risks either, but they usually give at least some space or air time to the other side. Articles in women's magazines, by contrast, frequently don't even acknowledge that there is another side. Many of the stories appear to be spoon-fed to the magazines by activists and go against mainstream science. Yet as the ADA survey suggests, women tend to trust these magazines more than any other type of media. The following examination of how these magazines -- <I>Better Homes & Gardens</I>, <I>Faily Circle</I>, <I>Glamour</I>, <I>Good Housekeeping, Ladies' Home Journal, Mademoiselle, McCall's, Parents, Redbook, Weight Watchers and Woman's Day</I>  --  treat certain risk issues indicates that much of this trust is misplaced. (Two of the magazines surveyed, <I>Prevention</I> and <I>Working Woman</I>, did not report on the risk issues studied here.) <BR>
<p>

<B>Chemicals and Health Effects.</b> "One of the most overblown risks is that minute quantities of pesticide residues on food are related to human cancer," Harvard's Graham told <I>Weight Watchers</I> </I>(December 1995)  in one of the only articles to put this risk in perspective. Other articles, including one in <I>Weight Watchers</I> itself, indicate that these magazines seem to have learned very little in the seven years since the Alar scare. The National Academy of Sciences, the most prestigious scientific body in the U.S., recently concluded that most "synthetic chemicals appear to be present at levels below which any significant biologic effect is likely, and so low that they are unlikely  to pose an appreciable cancer risk." The NAS also pointed out that man-made pesticides are greatly outnumbered by natural pesticides plants make themselves, and that many of these natural chemicals have been found to be just as potent as the synthetic ones. <BR>
<p>

Nevertheless, according to Graham's poll, around 70 percent of women believe pesticides pose a hazard (compared with less than 60 percent of men), and an examination of this issue's coverage in women's magazines helps explain why. Of the 15 stories on claims of serious health effects from chemicals, eight of the stories were completely one-sided and mentioned no skeptical arguments against the claims. Three of the stories mentioned opposing arguments, but did so in a superficial manner. Only 4 out of the 15 articles were balanced in that they explored skeptical arguments in detail and tried to get to the scientific truth. <BR>
<p>

In an August 6 <I>Faily Circle</I> article entitled "Danger in the House," the author warns of a "chemical invasion" from cleaning solutions and garden pesticides that "pose potential health risks ranging from allergic reactions to cancer." The article mentions no scientists who question these risks nor does it mention what level of exposure is needed before these ill health effects occur (just about all substances, natural and artificial, are harmful at some level). And the author uses the flimsy anecdotal case of a mother who blamed garden pesticides sprayed in her neighborhood for her daughters' stomach aches and vomiting (which could have had any number of causes), even though she didn't know what pesticides were being sprayed. The April <I>McCall's</I> ran a slightly less hysterical article on garden pesticides, but urged readers to contact the National Coalition Against the Issue of Pesticides, a radical environmental group that wants to ban pesticides even if they pose a very small risk. <BR>
<p>

<I>McCall's</I> (February 1996) and <I>Better Homes & Gardens</I> (March 1996) warned of pesticide residues in baby food, and these articles also contained no arguments casting doubt on pesticides dangers, although <I>McCall's</I> did quote a doctor saying that "the health benefits of eating fruits and vegetables are far, far greater than the risks." The article pointed out that babies and children are more sensitive to pesticides than adults, but never let readers know that government sets pesticide standards to account for individuals who are 1,000 times more sensitive than average. The articles also recommend that parents buy more expensive organic baby food, without mentioning the natural pesticide residues that may be contained in these foods and pose the same (small) risk. <BR>
<p>

Three stories in <I>Mademoiselle</I> (June 1996), <I>Glamour</I> (April 1996), and <I>Weight Watchers</II> </I>(June 1996) that reported on the alleged link between chemicals and breast cancer never mentioned that the largest study ever conducted found no correlation between that disease and synthetic chemicals such as DDT and PCBs. <I>Weight Watchers</I>  even condemned scientific studies that pointed to other possible causes such as genetics and diet as sexist because they "suggested it was a woman's fault if she developed breast cancer." <BR>
 <p>

The magazines that covered the newer chemical scare about "environmental estrogens" that allegedly affect reproductive health didn't fare much better. The two  stories in <I>Mademoiselle</I> (June 1996) and <I>Glamour </I>(April 1996) at least aired skeptical viewpoints but gave those opinions only a fraction of the space devoted to arguments for the scare. And both stories ignored important counter-arguments to some of the "facts" asserted by environmentalists. <I>Glamour</I>, for instance, did not report that the study that found declining sperm counts, a supposed effect of synthetic chemicals, had been severely criticized by many respected scientists and in an editorial in the very scientific journal that originally published it. <I>Mademoiselle</I> did mention in parentheses a new conflicting study that found that sperm counts have actually increased in the U.S. But the article did not mention how the new study casts doubts on the old study's finding of declining sperm counts by highlighting the geographic variation in sperm counts that the old study did not account for. Neither article mentioned that humans are exposed to far more natural estrogens from plants than to synthetic estrogen-licking chemicals. <BR>
<p>

The only story to mention pesticides' benefits in producing an affordable, abundant supply of fruits and vegetables was a July <I>Better Homes & Gardens</I> article that quoted an industry spokesman saying that he'd "rather take a chance on one ppb [parts per billion] in the food than on having no food at all." Unfortunately, the article then undercuts balance and accuracy by stating, without any evidence, that "concern about pesticide residue ... will become a moot point as the quality of organic produce continues to improve." This is wishful thinking. Agricultural experts such as the Hudson Institute's Dennis Avery, the former senior agricultural analyst for the U.S. Department of State, point out that crop yields from organic farms are typically less than half of those from conventional, high-yield farms, and that organic farms show no signs of catching up anytime soon. <BR>
<p>

The only two articles that critically examined chemical scares were stories in <I>Good Housekeeping</I> (September) and <I>Ladies' Home Journal</I> (March) that pointed out the lack of scientific evidence behind claims that artificial sweeteners were harmful. An article in the January</II> <I>Glamour </I>that has dentists rate natural toothpastes also deserves kudos because it points out that natural isn't always good and artificial isn't always bad. The dentists note that many of the natural toothpastes lack fluoride, which provides the most vital protection against decay, and that  many of the toothpastes' natural ingredients such as baking soda and sea salt may wear down tooth enamel. <BR>
 <p>

On the bright side, the magazines proved very capable of putting minor health effects from food ingredients in perspective. Most of the nine articles on the fat substitute olestra were just as good, if not better, than those published in the mainstream media. Six stories were careful to mention that only some people get side effects such as diarrhea, and that olestra snacks are fortified with vitamins to make up for the nutrients that olestra inhibits the body from receiving from other foods. Two articles in <I>Weight Watchers </I>(March and June) went over the arguments of olestra's defenders superficially, and only one article was completely one-sided against olestra and this was clearly marked in <I>Woman's Day</I> (July 16) as an opinion piece. <I>McCall's</I> gave the most balanced coverage of all by noting  that the percentage of olestra snackers suffering side effects in studies was virtually the same as that of the non-olestra snackers suffering side effects. All three stories on the flavor enhancer monosodium glutamate reported that most people don't suffer allergic reactions to it. <BR>
<p>

<B>Drinking Water/ Chlorine.</b> Women's magazines also featured many warnings about unsafe drinking water. Unless she were to read one balanced article about risks in the April 23 <I>Woman's Day</I>, a subscriber to these magazines would likely never know that "the American water supply is one of the safest in the world, and outbreaks of contamination ... are very rare." This was the only balanced article of the six articles that dealt with water. The other five were scare-mongering stories that did not even present another side to their points of view. <BR>
 <p>

With titles like "What's in your water?" and "Troubled waters," these articles usually couldn't see the algae for the lake. They vastly overstated drinking water's risks and failed to distinguish the real risks in water systems. For instance, articles in <I>Good Housekeeping </I>(November 1995), <I>Parents</I> (March), and <I>Mademoiselle</I> (September) uncritically reported an alarmist study by the Environmental Working Group about agricultural pesticide runoff in water and treated pesticides as if they were as serious a problem as cryptosporidium and other waterborne bacteria. But as agricultural expert Avery has written, "The fact is that field application of pesticides is not contaminating drinking water. The only pesticide residues exceeding good health standards in recent EPA and state surveys have been from known pollution sites." <BR>
<p>

One of the most ironic aspects of the water stories is that they routinely bash chlorine as unsafe, even though chlorine is the chemical that provides the most effective protection against waterborne diseases. Bizarre as it may seem, while the World Health Organization pursues chlorination of the world's drinking water systems as one of its top priorities, the July <I>Better Homes & Gardens</I> suggests that Americans stop putting chlorine in their pools! A subheading in <I>Good Housekeeping</I> asked, "Is chlorine bad for you?" <I>Mademoiselle</I> charged that "chlorine, normally a water safety hero because it kills most bacteria, produces cancer-causing by-products." <I>Good Housekeeping </I>did at least quote a scientist who says, "The risk of microbial contamination far outweighs the smaller increased risk of cancer." Yet none of the stories illustrated the risk of not using chlorine by informing readers what happened after Peru stopped chlorinating its water in the early '80s: a cholera epidemic that so far has killed 10,000 people. <BR>
<p>

As for the possible cancer risks of chlorine by-products, the award-winning cancer researcher Bruce Ames of the University of California-Berkeley (who, incidentally, was not quoted in any of the articles) points out that at the levels humans are exposed to, chlorine by-products in tap and swimming pool water are less carcinogenic than peanut butter, which contains the mold aflatoxin. <BR>
<p>

The story that the magazines all issued is that because the federal government issues top-down regulations that cost municipalities up to $37 billion a year (according to the Competitive Enterprise Institute) in chasing small risks such as pesticides and chlorine by-products, the municipalities often don't have the resources or the flexibility to fully pursue larger local risks like cryptosporidium. <BR>
<p>

<B>Passive Smoke.</b> In Graham's survey, almost 80 percent of women believed that environmental tobacco smoke or passive smoke was a serious health hazard, compared with slightly over 60 percent of men who believed this was so. Judging from the coverage of this issue in women's magazines, this may be another case where women's perceptions may be shaped or reinforced by the periodicals they read. Of five articles that covered the alleged health risk of passive smoke, only one featured any skeptical arguments. A December, 1995 <I>Weight Watchers</I> article proclaimed, "Mindful of secondhand-smoke risks, many cities are banning smoking in public places," without ever questioning if the risks were real. An April 23 <I>Woman's Day </I>article entitled "Health Scares: Real or Not" that did a good job of deflating other scares such as dirty water, uncritically accepts the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) estimate that passive smoke causes 3,000 lung cancer deaths a year. It is only in a four-page <I>Better Homes & Gardens</I> article that a skeptical view is even presented, and this article spends just two paragraphs quoting a Tobacco Institute spokesman who criticized the EPA and said passive smoke risks are "not even slight." <BR>
<p>

However, none of these articles gave readers a clue that it is not just tobacco industry spokesmen who question the EPA's findings on passive smoke. The non-partisan Congressional Research Service, for one, has concluded that "the statistical record does not appear to support a conclusion that there are substantial health effects of passive smoking." The CRS noted that under circumstances of conventional studies, the EPA's finding "is not statistically significant."  Steve Milloy, president of the Environmental Policy Analysis Network, have noted that even the risk the EPA did find (1.19) is so tiny that some experts don't even consider it a real risk. He notes that there are higher correlations between yogurt and ovarian cancer (2), whole ilk and lung cancer (2.14), and abortion and breast cancer (1.5), than there is between passive smoke and lung cancer. <BR>
<p>

The September <I>Parents</I> ran a one-sided article entitled "Smoking is Child Abuse" that blames passive smoke for a number of childhood illnesses. It quotes Dr. Joseph DiFranza as saying, "A judge should know whether an adult seeking custody of a youngster smokes, so the child isn't placed in an unhealthy environment." However, the article does not note that even DiFranza has acknowledged in a medical journal article that not all studies show these effects. Some researchers also question the notion that passive smoke could cause an illness such as middle ear disease when smoking itself has never been found to cause this illness. An article presenting both sides suggesting caution when smoking around children would have been appropriate, but this article is too one-sided and alarmist in the face of uncertain scientific research. <BR>
<p>

<b>Recycling.</b> According to women's magazines, recycling is always good. Out of 15 articles that mentioned recycling, there was not one skeptical argument presented that sometimes recycling is impractical and wastes resources. A statement typical of the philosophy of these articles came from an article in the June <I>Better Homes & Gardens</II> </I>that showcased products such as a yardbird made from old garden tools. The article said, "For recycling to be successful, consumers must make the process profitable for manufacturers by purchasing products made from recycled materials." But should manufacturers make recycled products if they're not profitable? Some reporters in the mainstream media are now breaking a taboo and asking this question. An article in the <I>New York Times Magazine</I> said that recycling not only is more costly than landfilling, it also is sometimes "a messy way to try to help the environment" and has environmental costs associated with it, citing examples of energy wasted by additional garbage trucks that have to pick up recycled materials. <BR>
<p>

<b>Alcohol.</b> One area where women's magazines have a better record at reporting on  comparative risks is in articles weighing the health benefits of moderate drinking against the hazards of excess drinking. An article in <I>McCall's </I>(May) and two in <I>Good Housekeeping </I>(May and September) reported on the announcement in Department of Agriculture's Dietary Guidelines that moderate consumption of alcohol can lower the risk of heart disease. The articles note, however, that drinking can be hazardous with medications, during pregnancy, or in excess. Unfortunately, another article in <I>Good Housekeeping</I> (August 1996) focuses on the "overlooked dangers" alcohol poses to women without mentioning its health benefits. And a "To Do" article in the January <I>Weight Watchers</I> on hangovers ended by saying, "And remember: Alcohol is a drug, so it's best not to drink in the first place." <BR>
  <p>

<b>Nannyism.</b> The biggest risk issues women's magazine take on have to do with household products. Frequently, there are articles that give good advice about how to select the safest products for children and how to monitor children using these products. However, there is a disturbing tendency in seven articles for the authors to act as a national nanny and preach to readers what they should and shouldn't buy. Articles in <I>Woman's Day</I> (June 4 and Aug. 6) tell mothers not to allow guns to be kept in the house. <I>Woman's Day</I> (Feb. 1) and <I>Parents</I> (March) tell moms not to let kids play with BB guns. In these cases, the authors are not serving their readers by informing of risks, they are crossing the line into substituting their value judgments for those of their readers. Many of these articles also fail to point out that the product isn't as much of a danger as is the lack of parental supervision. For instance, a June 4 <I>Woman's Day</I> article recommended that parents not buy baby walkers because they injured 25,000 children each year. But the article failed to note that according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, over 20,000 children who are not in baby walkers also are injured falling down the stairs each year. A much better article on how to manage risks comes from August <I>Parents</I>. The article describes a possible hazard that may occur when lead in imported miniblinds  breaks down into dust particles and children lick the blinds. But it quotes someone who points out that this can be taken care of by washing the blinds yearly. <BR>
<P> 
<B><I>Ladies' Home Journal</I>'s Valuable Advice.</B> This study reviewed 56 mentions of science and risk issues. Of those, 35 -- more than half -- were completely one-sided and did not even acknowledge a skeptical view. Six include an opposing view but gave it much less ink and discussed it superficially. Only 15 were balanced articles that put risks in perspective by reference to scientific findings.  Clearly, women and families have enough to worry about and don't need new, baseless fears added to their burden. Indeed, many women would be interested in articles that report how much government regulations for tiny risks cost them and their families. The Small Business Administration places the costs of regulation at almost $7000 per household. This cost is passed on to women and families in terms of higher prices and less competition and product innovation. <BR>
<P>
The article that, by far, provided the best overall coverage of health and science issues appeared in the March issue of <I>Ladies' Home Journal</I>. In that article, Alfred Sommer, dean of the School of Hygiene and Public Health at  Johns Hopkins University, gave some guidelines to help readers evaluate health claims. Judging from the quality of their articles on risk issues, women's magazine writers should learn some of Sommer's tips as well: <BR>
<P>
"Keep in mind that each study is a piece of a bigger puzzle. View each new finding as an update rather than the final word." <BR>
<P>
"Remember that most studies highlight an association between a behavior characteristic and a health outcome, not necessarily a cause-and-effect relationship." <BR>
<P>
"Even when an association between a particular behavior and a health risk is found it doesn't mean one leads to the other." <BR>
<P>
"Finally, consider the size and duration of the study (the larger it is and the longer it ran, the more dependable its findings) and the source of the report." <BR>

<BR>
Reporters consider most risky products newsworthy, but tobacco gets far more coverage than any other risky 
product, including such illegal drugs as cocaine and marijuana. This is one conclusion of a special year-long, 
two-part study of news coverage of risky products. The study, conducted by the Media Research Center's Free
Market Project, analyzes network morning and evening news shows between August 1, 1995 and July 31, 1996. 
The study found:
<UL>
<LI> <B>Tobacco as a risk problem is overemphasized.</B></a><BR> Tobacco and smoking were the subject of 413 news stories, compared to 136 stories for obesity/fatty foods, 94 for auto safety, and 58 for alcohol. Tobacco even drew more coverage than cocaine, heroin, LSD, and marijuana combined, which were the subjects of 340 stories.
<P>
<LI><B> The media have allowed the Clinton Administration to use tobacco as a political weapon.</B> </a><BR>President Clinton was the driving force behind a good deal of the tobacco news. Eighty-five stories focused on his efforts to regulate tobacco. Only 45 of the stories about illegal drugs mentioned Clinton, and almost all of these references were positive.

<H3><CENTER>Part I: Tobacco Versus Other Risky Products</CENTER></H3>
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
Consumers face risks when they choose to buy and consume certain products. But the news media do not treat all of those risks the same. Tobacco, especially, receives far more total coverage with a far more negative tone than does every other risky product.
This is the finding of a special year-long Media Research Center study of news coverage of risky products and the industries which make and sell them. For the study, Media Research Center analysts reviewed all of the stories about several risky products on the morning and evening news shows on ABC, CBS, and NBC, as well as CNN's World News and World Today shows between August 1, 1995 and July 31, 1996. Tobacco and the tobacco industry received more negative coverage by far than any other risky legal product or its maker, such as dietary fat and the food industry, automobiles and the auto industry, alcohol and the alcohol industry, and pesticides and the chemical industry. Tobacco even received more coverage than illegal drugs. This media obsession with tobacco affected coverage of other issues as well, even coverage of the 1996 presidential campaign.

<H4> Tobacco and Illegal Drugs</H4>
<P>
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
Which is worse, a legal product that if used over many decades can be life-threatening, or an illegal product that can be of more immediate danger?
<P>
For America's news media, the answer is overwhelmingly the former. Over the twelve-month study period television news has devoted significantly more air time to reporting on tobacco than to reporting on cocaine, heroin, LSD, and marijuana combined.
<P>
There were 413 stories during the twelve-month study period about tobacco; there were 340 stories about illegal drugs. This disparity was present despite well-documented rapid increases in the use of illegal drugs over the past few years, notably among teenagers. It should be noted, too, that many of the stories about illegal drugs were brief anchor-reads about, for instance, the status of football star Michael Irvin's drug trial, not rising drug use.
<P>
Among the print media, the disparity has been even greater. A Nexis search of headlines in American newspapers found that the terms "tobacco or smoking or cigarette" were employed 9,067 times between during the study period. Over the same time period, however, the terms "cocaine or heroin or LSD or marijuana or illegal drugs" were used only 3,875 times. In other words, there were more than twice as many stories focusing on tobacco than there were stories focusing on illegal drugs.

President Clinton has helped put the tobacco story on the map. Eighty-five of the television news tobacco stories were about the Clinton Administration's attacks on the tobacco industry. Almost all of these stories were upbeat about Clinton's attempts to regulate the industry, portraying him as courageously taking on a powerful industry. NBC's Bryant Gumbel, for instance, announced on the August 11, 1995 Today that "in a historic move the Clinton Administration has declared nicotine to be a drug and has proposed regulations aimed at curbing smoking by teenagers." According to CBS' John Roberts, on the August 10, 1995 This Morning, "President Clinton is stepping up federal efforts to harness smoking among teenagers. He'll detail some tough new measures today that are sure to put him at odds with the powerful tobacco lobby."
<P>
But when the issue was the increased use of illegal drugs, Clinton Administration officials were only mentioned in 45 stories, and most of these references were positive. Again, the disparity is revealing. The same reporters who are willing to accept Clinton's premise that government policies can discourage smoking behavior among the young demand little accountability from him for increased illegal drug use. And there was rarely even the suggestion in the media that the president was playing up the tobacco issue to hide how much illegal drug use had increased during his watch.
<P>
Among the print media, the same disparity was present. A Nexis search reveals that there were 1,819 stories between August 1, 1995 and July 31, 1996 that had "tobacco or smoking or cigarette" in the headline and a reference to Bill Clinton in the body of the story. Stories with the terms "cocaine or heroin or LSD or marijuana or illegal drugs" in the headline and a reference to Clinton in the body of the story numbered only 204.
<P>
This media's obvious distaste for tobacco continued after the study period and affected campaign coverage as the 1996 presidential contest heated up. Normally, when a politician radically changes positions on an issue, it's big news. For instance, there were five network evening news stories during the 1996 Republican National Convention about Jack Kemp altering his positions on illegal immigration and affirmative action once he became the Republican vice-presidential candidate. 
<P>
"The quarterback became the acrobat today," reported ABC's Jackie Judd on the August 14, 1996 World News Tonight. "Kemp was flip-flopping on long held positions." She noted that these changes "left at least one delegate here feeling abandoned" and that "Kemp's change in position on these core issues fights the very image that he's built for himself as an independent thinker." According to Dan Rather, on that same night's CBS Evening News, "Bob Dole has reversed himself on deficit reduction versus tax cuts. Jack Kemp has reversed himself on how he feels about immigration." Rather wondered: "Isn't that, or is it, going to make it more difficult to attack Bill Clinton on the character issue?"
<P>
But these bloodhounds sniffing out hypocrisy turned quiet when Vice President Al Gore radically changed his position on tobacco. In his speech to the Democratic National Convention, Gore said that his sister's death from lung cancer in 1984 prompted his anti-tobacco crusade. None of the networks pointed out that in 1988, he boasted to tobacco growers that "throughout most of my life, I raised tobacco. I want you to know that with my own hands, all of my life, I put it in the plant beds and transferred it. I've hoed it. I've dug it in. I've sprayed it, I've chopped it, I've shredded it, spiked it, put it in the barn and stripped it and sold it." There were no stories on the evening news shows during the convention about Gore's change of heart. The same reporters who derided Kemp for changing positions on immigration and affirmative action didn't find Gore's flip-flop on tobacco at all newsworthy.
<P>
<a name="fat">

<BR>
 <H4> Tobacco and Fat</H4>
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
There was an even greater disparity between the number of stories on tobacco and the number on other legal products. On television -- during the same time period in which there were 413 stories about tobacco -- there were 136 stories about dietary fat and obesity; 94 stories focused on auto safety; only 58 stories were related to alcohol and health.
<P>
The disparity between reporting on tobacco and reporting on dietary fat and obesity is especially curious. The same health advocates who tell us that tobacco contributes to 400,000 deaths in the U.S. each year also report that obesity contributes to 300,000 deaths in the U.S. per year. It would stand to reason, then, that there would be about three-fourths the number of stories on fat and obesity as there were about tobacco. There weren't.
<P>
Reporters acknowledged the riskiness of obesity and dietary fat. "Obesity, of course, is a major health problem in this country," NBC's Tom Brokaw reported on the April 29, 1996 Nightly News. "It is estimated that it's responsible for 300,000 deaths a year from heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes and the like." CBS' Jacqueline Adams reported that "for years doctors have known that during pregnancy, obesity can cause serious problems like diabetes and bleeding for the mother. But according to two new studies in tomorrow's Journal of the American Medical Association, obesity in the mother can also cause serious problems for the fetus," including birth defects.
<P>
One reporter, ABC's John McKenzie, insisted that even one high-fat meal, if eaten at an inopportune moment, can be dangerous. McKenzie told viewers about a University of Marylyand study  in which researchers "found that after a high-fat meal, arteries, when required to handle an increased flow of blood, could expand on average only 50 percent of normal. It means that under conditions of stress and exertion, people who already have constricted arteries may not get enough blood to the heart."
<P>
While reporters acknowledged this riskiness, they didn't give the risk of obesity and dietary fat nearly the same amount of coverage they gave to tobacco. There were only about one-fourth the number of stories about obesity and fat as there were stories about tobacco, even though obesity contributes to three-fourths as many deaths each year as tobacco.
<P>
<a name="complain">

<BR>
<H4>Complaints Against Tobacco</H4>
<P>
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
There was also a different standard of judgment for the industries that make and sell other risky products. They were never subjected to nearly the same hostility that the tobacco industry endured. There were no stories, for example, about fast-food advertising enticing kids and others to consume products that may one day kill them. Nor were there any stories pointing out the medical costs of obesity. And no network reporter sought to outline the campaign contributions of companies which produce and sell alcohol. But the networks were all critical of tobacco advertising and campaign contributions, as well as the medical costs to society of smoking-related illnesses.
<P>
In stories about advertising, the assumption was clear: Cunning tobacco advertising entices unwitting youngsters into lifelong addiction to tobacco. ABC's Nancy Snyderman, for instance, reported "that 12-18 year-olds are in fact most influenced by [tobacco] advertising...and obviously we know that the earlier you smoke, the more addicted you are, the harder it is to break. So I think it's one more indication that advertising works."
<P>
But there are those both inside and outside the tobacco and advertising industries who question how effective -- and how constitutional -- proposed regulations on tobacco advertising could be. "How will banning tobacco ads possibly discourage smoking?" asked columnist James K. Glassman in the August 27, 1996 Washington Post. "LSD use rose 183 percent between 1992 and 1995, and I haven't seen any LSD ads recently." Such arguments were rarely heard on television news.
<P>
Another big tobacco story: The political donations of the industry and how those donations allegedly affected politicians' attitudes and actions toward tobacco. Reason magazine senior editor Jacob Sullum, writing in the July 29 National Review, asserted that in such reports, the assumption usually is "that tobacco companies had given Dole and the Republican Party a lot of money, so he was clearly in league with the devil." According to Sullum, such reports assume the industry buys votes and never consider "the possibility that politicians...might get tobacco money because they support certain policies, rather than the other way around."
<P>
Sullum is right. Linda Douglass, for example, on the June 27, 1996 CBS Evening News, told viewers that "Dole now is in the uncomfortable position of often siding with the tobacco industry just as cigarette makers are pumping unprecedented sums of money into the Republican Party." On the same night, NBC's Bob Kur, after quoting the Clinton campaign's charge that Dole was toeing the tobacco industry line, pointed out, with a large on-screen graphic, that the industry "gave nearly $3 million in political contributions last year, 85 percent of the money to Republicans." Industry -- especially tobacco industry -- contributions were all reporters cared about. The political contributions of trial lawyers or unions sparked little media interest.
<P>
Second-hand smoke was the focus of twelve stories. Reporters were much more likely to cover studies showing that second-hand smoke leads to health problems in non-smokers than they were to cover studies which questioned such data. Example: A November 14, 1995 Congressional Research Service study, while not declaring passive smoke to be safe, questioned some of the numbers put forward by second-hand smoke critics. The number of stories on the CRS study -- zero.
<P>
Reporters often mistook experts on health and medicine for experts on public policy. Bob Kur, on the April 9, 1996 Today, introduced viewers to a doctor who studied the effects of second-hand smoke on children. Kur didn't show any skepticism toward the doctor when he recommended that "smoking be banned wherever children are present and even suggests smoking be considered in child custody cases and foster home placements. With tobacco under increasing assault, [Dr.] DiFranza also believes a study like his could prompt a class-action lawsuit on behalf of children." Kur didn't allow other views into his story, such as the view that separating children from their smoking parents is a bit extreme or the view that much tobacco litigation is frivolous.
<P>
Journalists seem to have lost some perspective when reporting on tobacco. They not only air far more stories on tobacco than on other legal risky products, but they have allowed the Clinton administration to use smoking to deflect public attention from rising illegal drug use. Responsible reporters should not ignore tobacco, but they should not apply to it a standard which is harsher even than the standard they apply to illegal drugs.

<H3><CENTER>Part II: Sources</CENTER></H3>
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
One subtle, but powerful, form of bias in the media has to do with selection and placement of soundbites from sources. The most obvious display of source bias is when reporters interview or use sources only from one side of an issue. Sometimes, however, a story is biased even when reporters have conscientiously produced soundbites from both sides. One side may consistently get the last word in a story, thereby giving it an edge. Or reporters may interview sources from one side that will be credible in the eyes of viewers and less credible sources from the other. In the case of tobacco reporting during the year-long study period, every one of these biases was present.
<P>

<P>
<a name="number">
<P>
<BR>
<H4>Number of Soundbites</H4>
<P>
<p>[ <a href="#content">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
 In stories about tobacco regulation, tobacco advertising, tobacco lawsuits, campaign contributions from tobacco companies, and second-hand smoke, there were more than twice as many soundbites from those opposed to the tobacco industry than from those either supporting tobacco or opposing government regulation. In such stories, there were 270 soundbites from anti-tobacco/pro-regulation sources. There were only 116 soundbites from pro-tobacco/anti-regulation sources. In many stories, only anti-tobacco/pro-regulation sources were presented.
<P>
Example: The introductory story for the May 23, 1996 CBS Evening News. The story was about a class-action lawsuit against the tobacco industry that had just been thrown out of court and a new study which indicated that smoking had increased among young blacks. Correspondent Jim Stewart's story included a soundbite about the lawsuit from John Banzhaf, an anti-smoking activist, who said: "I think this is a significant setback for the victims, but it is not a reprieve for the tobacco industry. We'll simply bring the cases in state court rather than federal court." He also interviewed Rep. John Lewis about tobacco sales to black teens. "I think there has been a deliberate, systematic effort on the part of the tobacco industry to target black teenagers." Stewart noted that many blamed advertising for the increase in smoking. He didn't make room in his story for comments from those who think tobacco lawsuits are frivolous, or from those who think advertising doesn't explain teen smoking behavior.
<a name="word">
<P>
<BR>
<H4> Getting the Last Word</H4>
<P>
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
The last soundbite in a story is often the most important. The exeprt who is quoted last often gets the chance to refute the best argument presented from the other side. In the stories about tobacco, anti-tobacco/pro-regulation sources were given the opportunity to speak last more than three times as often pro-tobacco or anti-regulation sources. In 132 stories, most of which were about either lawsuits or proposed regulations, anti-tobacco/pro-regulation sources were given the last word. In 40 stories, pro-tobacco/anti-regulation sources were given the last word.
<P>
In one typical story, CBS's Bill Plante first ran a soundbite from Bill Clinton arguing that further regulation of tobacco is necessary because "cigarettes and smokeless tobacco are harmful, highly addictive, and aggressively marketed to our young people." He then ran a soundbite from "tobacco-state lawmaker" Wendell Ford, who said: "The administration has chosen litigation over compromise." Plante's next soundbite was from Clinton arguing that voluntary measures won't work: "First of all, there'd be no way to enforce it. Secondly, the history of voluntary agreements with the tobacco industry is not good, to put it mildly." Steve Parrish of Philip Morris, then told viewers: "Make no mistake, the real issue and the real agenda here is prohibition." Plante's final soundbite was from FDA Commissioner David Kessler, who said the issue was solely about children: "If you don't start smoking by 18 or 19, you don't start smoking."
<P>
In each case, Plante let soundbites from Clinton Administration sources counter whatever arguments anti-regulation spokesmen brought up, without giving the anti-regulation side the same courtesy.
<a name="credible">
<P>
<BR>
<H4> Credibility of Sources</H4>
<P>
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
In the stories about tobacco, television news reporters almost always went to anti-smoking sources that would likely be more credible in the eyes of viewers than the sources interviewed on the pro-tobacco/anti-regulation side. An August 3, 1995 CNN World News story about President Clinton's attempts to regulate the industry is an example. Correspondent Wolf Blitzer first ran a soundbite from President Clinton, who asserted that the best way to improve the health and health care of Americans is to stop teen smoking.
<P>
Then Blitzer ran a soundbite from George Dessart of the American Cancer Society. "Trusting the tobacco industry to set and enforce the same limits voluntarily," argued Dessart, "flies in the face of the industry's record, of its best interests, and of its motives." Blitzer then allowed the Tobacco Institute's Walker Merryman a chance to respond: "If the Food & Drug Administration gets involved in tobacco regulation there can be only one result, and that's a ban on the product." Finally, Blitzer ran a soundbite from North Carolina Representative Charlie Rose, who asked, "Why not take the word of the cigarette companies that they will join in a government partnership to keep tobacco products away from kids?"
<P>
Is this balance? Blitzer interviewed two sources from each side of the regulatory debate, and he even gave an anti-regulation congressman the last word. But both of those featured on the anti-regulation side of the debate had a personal interest in opposing regulations. This, of course, didn't make what they had to say wrong, but it certainly would taint their opinions in the eyes of viewers, unlike the source affiliated with the American Cancer Society. Blitzer should have also interviewed an expert, perhaps from a university psychology or marketing department, who would have questioned the efficacy of regulations on advertising.
<P>
In some cases reporters cannot be expected to find credible sources on both sides. For example, balance does not require reporters to find and interview scientists who claim that smoking is not risky behavior. But on such issues as tobacco regulation, tobacco advertising, tobacco lawsuits, campaign contributions by the tobacco industry, and second-hand smoke, there is a real debate with independent experts arguing, for instance, against the regulation of tobacco and against lawsuits aimed at the tobacco industry.
<P>
Usually the only people opposing tobacco regulations who were interviewed were those with a vested interest in stopping regulations, such as tobacco-industry spokesmen or tobacco-state politicians. Such sources should be interviewed. But they are not the only ones who oppose increased regulation. Other disinterested experts should be interviewed as well. Reporters who don't interview credible experts on both sides of such issues are not giving their viewers the entire story.

<p></center>
In every recent presidential election the media have tilted their coverage toward the liberal nominee. One poll by the  <!--a href="/may96pg1.html"-->Freedom Forum found 89 percent of Washington reporters voted for Bill Clinton in '92. 
<p>
We fully expect the media to again portray Congressional Republicans as out-of-touch extremists and the Democratic incumbents as mainstream moderates. 
<p>
The Democrats will portray themselves as the last defense against a takeover of the presidency and Congress by far-right extremists out to destroy 
the environment, starve the poor, and throw the elderly on the
 streets.
  The media will let them get away with this by failing to highlight Clinton's liberal policies. 
<p>
To neutralize this bias, the MRC launched a $2.8 million effort to expose liberal media bias during the 1996 election campaign. Read <a href="/mrc/reality/pcspeech.html">Chairman L. Brent Bozell's</a> speech.
<p>
<a href="/mrc/reality/realchek.html">Media Reality Check '96</a> will counter the media's liberal spin through our comprehensive media database of network news stories, our newsletters 
<a href="/mrc/mediawatch/welcome.html"><b>MediaWatch</b></a>, 
<a href="/mrc/nq/welcome.html"><b>Notable Quotables</b></a>, and 
<a href="/mrc/medianomics/welcome.html"><b>MediaNomics</b></a>, and our new book 
<a href="/mrc/bookstore/welcome.html"><b>Pattern of Deception</b></a>
, proving the media's pro-Clinton bias. 
<p>
In addition, several new projects are now or will soon be available on-line:
<p><ul>
<li>Two-page Media Reality Check '96 updates will be periodically 
sent via <a href="/mrc/reality/pressrel.html"><b>Fax Reports</b></a>
 to a list of over 1,500 media, political, public policy and grassroots contacts around the country, documenting examples of biased coverage and detailing study results proving bias.
<p>
<li>A daily <a href="/mrc/cyberalert/conv96.html"><b> Media Reality Check</b></a> newsletter to be distributed to delegates, talk show hosts, and reporters at the Republican Convention in San Diego and the Democratic Convention in Chicago. Through e-mail, faxes and on-site delivery in San Diego, we'll get our evidence distributed to talk show hosts, columnists, editorial writers, and reporters across the country.
 <p>
<li><a href="/mrc/cyberalert/welcome.html"><b>CyberAlerts</b></a> on campaign bias: Several times a week we'll deliver e-mail alerts on the latest biased quotes and trends to reporters, talk show hosts, columnists, and conservative activists. To sign up for CyberAlerts, send your e-mail address to <a href="mailto:mrc@mediaresearch.org">mrc@mediaresearch.org</a>.
<p>
<li><b>Press releases</b> will announce study findings, provide our reaction to bias as it occurs, and give warning shots to reporters before major events, telling them how to avoid biased coverage. 
<p>
<li><b>Convention Guide to the Media</b> will be distributed at the conventions to show through past quotes which reporters have been naughty or nice. 
<p>
<li><b>MRC Merchandise</b>: Bumper stickers, pens and magnets boldly displaying our message "I Don't Believe the Liberal News Media!" will be distributed to delegates at the national conventions and to the public.

<center><h1>The Media's Coverage of Election Night '96</h1></center>
<P>
<P>
<I><B>November 6, 1996:  MRC analysts are working furiously to get you the latest liberal bias spouted by the media on election night and during the post-election coverage.  MRC <a href="/mrc/cyberalert/">CyberAlerts</a>, studies, and reports will soon be released. Until then, here's the tip of the iceberg of the Election Night '96 coverage:</I></B><P>
<P>
<P>

NBC <I>Today</I>'s Matt Lauer to RNC Chairman Haley Barbour, 11/6/96:<BR>  
"Mr. Barbour, exit polls show us that the economy was still the number one issue on people's mind last night.  And although character and trust play a role, people choose candidates based on their handling of the issues.  With that in mind, what do you say to people now who look to Republicans in Congress and say, hey, move forward on key legislation. Don't get bogged down on investigations into the Clinton White House?"<BR>
<P>

CBS<I> This Morning</I>'s Troy Roberts, 11/6/96: <BR> 
"The pundits had written his political obituary, but last night Newt Gingrich oversaw a victory, just barely, as voters ratified the two-year-old revolution that changed the face of Congress.  The party retains control of the House, despite discouraging poll figures about its leader..."<BR>
<P>

ABC's David Brinkley talking to Sam Donaldson, Cokie Roberts, Jeff Greenfield, Lynn Sherr, Hal Bruno and Peter Jennings during the final minutes of <I>The '96 Vote</I>, 11/6/96: <BR>
"OK, fine, I'm not going to say much.  Among things I admire, almost near the top is creativeness, and everyone in this group has it.  It shows in your work, it shows in your thinking, and it shows in your speech, what you do, what you write, what you say, and it's one reason this group is so terrific.  Bill Clinton has none of it, he has not a creative bone in his body.  Therefore, he's a bore and will always be a bore."<BR>

More coverage coming soon!  <BR>

<center><h1> Statement of L. Brent Bozell III <BR>
Chairman, Media Research Center </h1></center>
<center><h3> <a href="http://www.conservative.org">ACU Press Conference</a><BR>
November 6, 1996</h3></center>
<P>
<P>
	In 1990 a group of conservative leaders - some present today - publicly predicted George Bush would lose his campaign for re-election because his administration had abandoned the mission of the Reagan revolution.  As the '92 campaign unfolded , and the lackluster, issue-less Bush campaign limped through the summer and fall, it became evident our prediction would be correct.<BR>
<P>

	Bob Dole had two diametrically opposite strategies to choose from this year.  Follow in the footsteps of Ronald Reagan with a conservative agenda outlining not just a vision of, but a specific agenda for, a limited government, a strong national defense and a commitment to family values - a strategy that led to two landslide elections; or follow in the footsteps of Bush, with  no vision,  and virtually no message.  It was stunning to see Dole for months reject the Reagan message, and adopt the Bush non-agenda.  And when, in the final days, he decided to move to the right, Dole, like Bush in '92, closed the gap.  But like Bush in '92, it was too little too late. <BR>
<P>

	Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.  Santayana would have made for a good political pundit this year. <BR>
<P>

	But there was another similarity.  In both campaigns, the GOP nominee made the same terrible miscalculation, assuming the national media, particularly the networks, would report on the elections in a fair and balanced manner. <BR>
<P>

	In 1992, Bill Clinton presented himself to America as a "New Democrat" and embraced a strongly conservative agenda in his campaign.  It was a farce, and those who knew this man's record said so.  The media, however, were silently, refusing to expose the charade - and no one was surprised when Clinton immediately launched a left-wing agenda in 1993, abandoning promise after campaign promise.  Also in 1992, reporters, contrary to the conventional mythology perpetrated by so many in the press, barely touched numerous Clinton scandals; some, like Whitewater, were ignored completely by the networks throughout the entirety of the campaign. <BR>
<P>

	Remarkably, Clinton pulled it off again this year.  After his Big Government agenda was so decisively rejected after two years, Clinton announced the era of Big Government was dead - and then took responsibility for it.  What followed in this campaign was dishonesty after dishonestly, twisting the facts, distorting the truth, even claiming on national television to stand in favor of issue after issue that he had, in fact, actively opposed!  But what made this situation even worse, the so-called Truth Squads in the media, again particularly on the networks, simply took a pass, and refused to expose the dishonesty. <BR>
<P>
 

	But where the coverage of ethical scandals was concerned, the record this year from the networks was simply abominable.  At this moment the Media Research Center is analyzing every single network news story in the past four years to determine how many Clinton scandals, or major developments within them, were completely ignored by the networks, either on their evening news or their morning news programs.  Having seen the initial data, I can tell you that when this report is released in a couple of weeks, the American public will be absolutely shocked at the sheer number of scandals covered up by the networks. <BR>
<P>

	The next few months will tell the story.  If in that period Clinton delivers on his campaign promises - tax cuts, a balanced budget, reduced federal government, a strong national defense, a ban on partial birth abortions,  support for the institution of marriage, school choice; and if the literally dozens of scandals swirling around this administration in general, and the Clintons in particular, all prove to be groundless as this administration contends, then there really is a Tooth Fairy.  But if Clinton returns to his left-wing agenda while the indictments begin to fly, no one standing here will be shocked; and the American public is going to demand to know why the networks did not report what they knew was going to happen.  I will be one of those demanding an answer. <BR>

<h2>MEDIA REALITY CHECK BLAST</h2>


Whitewater: The Story Reporters Loved to Hate
<p>

ALEXANDRIA, VA. &#173;&#173; In a study of nearly three months of network and news magazine coverage, the Media Research Center found that despite the suggestion that
the national media's only bias is in favor of &quot;a good story,&quot; the Whitewater story &#173;&#173; indictments, convictions, Senate hearings, and all &#173;&#173; is still the story reporters love to hate. The lack of coverage is matched by the disparaging tone members of the media have displayed toward Whitewater over the past few months. A representative sampling of these follows on page two.
<p>

First, among the study findings:<p>

From February 29 to May 20, the four TV evening news shows aired only 23 reporter&#173;based stories on Whitewater in more than 11 weeks. Only 13 reports came from the Big Three, compared to ten stories on CNN's The World Today.
Eleven of the 23 stories focused on the President's testimony.
<p>
The most stunning lack of coverage came from NBC Nightly News, which aired only one reporter&#173;based story in the entire 11 weeks &#173;&#173; on May 9.
<p>
The three network morning shows aired only 14 reporter&#173;based stories and five interviews in 11 weeks. Again, much of the coverage (nine of the 14 stories and
two of the five interviews) concerned Clinton's testimony.
<p>
None of the magazine shows covered the trial &#173;&#173; but then, from 1992 forward, all of the magazine shows combined have aired only two reporter&#173;based stories
on Whitewater. 
<p>
Although Time carried a long cover story excerpting James Stewart's Whitewater book Blood Sport, the news magazines devoted fewer pages to the Whitewater trial than they
did to the Jackie Onassis auction. In their May 6 editions, Time made the auction their cover story and gave it eight pages, Newsweek devoted six pages, U.S. News, two.

<p>
Some significant stories the networks barely or never covered: 

<p>
On February 29 and again on March 7, Senate Democrats blocked votes extending the tenure of the Senate Whitewater Committee. The Democrats held up further hearings until agreeing to a deal on April 18. One reporter&#173;based story on ABC's World News Tonight (and anchor briefs on ABC's Good Morning America and CNN) were the only coverage of the Democratic filibuster until the hearings resumed April 24.
<p>
On March 15, a federal appeals court removed Judge Henry Woods from a related case against Gov. Jim Guy Tucker and reinstated four fraud counts struck down by Woods,
finding the judge was too close to the Clintons. Despite several network stories and an entire Nightline on the credibility of independent counsel Kenneth Starr, the networks never covered the Woods story.                        
<p>
On March 24, an ABC News/Washington Post poll announced 52 percent of respondents believed the First Lady was not telling the truth about Whitewater and 49 percent said
they believe she acted illegally. While the Post published the poll, buried on page A16, ABC never reported it. 

<p>
When word leaked on April 29 that the FBI found Hillary Clinton's fingerprints on the long&#173;missing Rose Law Firm documents discovered in the White House, it drew
only four anchor&#173;read briefs.Second, there's a good reason why Whitewater has received so little coverage: Many reporters don't think it's worth covering or that it's been over covered.
<p>
Check out these recent quotes:
<p>
On Friday's Washington Week in Review (May 24) on PBS they discussed the RNC ad attacking Clinton for invoking the Soldier and Sailors' Act, prompting New York Times
columnist Tom Friedman to note the ad was created &quot;Right when Whitewater seems to be grinding to a halt as a legal issue.&quot; A few minutes later, moderator Ken Bode (also a CNN analyst), offered his view of why Republicans decided to run the ad: &quot;Whitewater is sort of diminishing, sort of fading away, it's kind of a shadowy
thing now, it's going away.&quot; 
<p>
Steve Roberts of U.S. News &amp; World Report, on C&#173;SPAN's Washington Journal, May 16: &quot;This kind of call which says, 'You're all liberals,' haven't been listening, they haven't been reading. Anybody, anybody, it seems to me, who
gives a fair reading, Brian [Lamb], of the press coverage of Bill Clinton's first three years, cannot say that the press has been easy on Bill Clinton. The press has beaten the hell out of Bill Clinton over and over again, and Whitewater, which that caller mentions, is just one example and day after day coverage of that issue, which is legitimate and should be there.&quot;

<p>
Time columnist Margaret Carlson and U.S. News &amp; World Report Editor&#173;in&#173;Chief Mort Zuckerman on CNBC's Cal Thomas show, March 24, 1996: 
<p>
Carlson: &quot;It's [Whitewater] out there, it's been out there, it's not going to have any more impact than it's already having.&quot; 
<p>
Zuckerman: &quot;I don't think there's anything there unless Kenneth Starr does come up with anything, and the fact that there is a trial going on I think is not going to be relevant to what the elections going to be all about, you can't run an election based on attacking the President's wife.&quot;

<p>
Eleanor Clift of Newsweek on The McLaughlin Group, February 10, 1996: &quot;If Ken Starr is a credible prosecutor he will bring this to a conclusion and the Clintons will be exonerated.&quot;

<p>
Margaret Carlson, Time magazine columnist and former White House reporter, on CNN's Capital Gang, December 23, 1995: &quot;As the curtains keep getting lifted there's nothing there! There's no big, you know, there's no big smoking gun. There's no magilla! And they keep going and not finding anything.&quot;

Bryant Gumbel:
<blockquote>
<P>
 "You write that you prayed more during your four
years in office than basically at any time in your life and yet I
think it's fair to say, and I hope this doesn't sound harsh, I
think it's fair to say, you are consistently viewed as one of the
more ineffective Presidents of modern times."

 "Well, I think that's harsh and unfair, but you have
a right to your opinion."

"In the realm of honest graft, Clinton didn't do anything Bob Dole
didn't do; he and his party just did it with the seal of the White
House behind them." <DD>-- Time's Michael Duffy and Nancy Gibbs,
November 11.
<P>
"The intricate squalor of Democratic fundraising is the news of
the moment. But here's the big surprise: funny money is a
bipartisan indulgence. Here's another: Bob Dole -- gasp! -- is in
on the game. For most of his Senate career, Dole was the pro of
the quid pro quo. No one else has been more effective at working
the filigree of legislation, digging out just the groove to let
the American government's generosity flow unimpeded to his most
loyal supporters. And the GOP generally has engaged for years in
imaginative fundraising, and favors trading that would make
anybody blush." <DD>-- Time's Richard Lacayo, next page.
<P>
"Fortunately for Clinton, Dole had already blocked
campaign-finance reform and stuffed his pockets. (Ever hear of the
sugar-growing Cuban immigrant contributor or the $6 million fine
for a Republican with a money-laundering operation in Hong Kong?"
<DD>-- Time columnist Margaret Carlson, same issue.

"Let's define what we mean by attacks on Kenneth Starr. It's fair
game to point out that he is a partisan Republican, that he
defends the tobacco interests...Yes! He got his job under very
seamy circumstances. That's fair game." <DD>-- Newsweek's Eleanor
Clift on the November 16 McLaughlin Group.
<P>
<br>
<b>vs.</b>
<P>
<br>
"Watergate was a criminal conspiracy conducted out of the Oval
Office. There is nothing even remotely like that alleged against
this President. We ought to wait and see what Ken Starr says. He's
the only one who has credibility, in my mind, in bringing forth
this investigation." <DD>-- Clift, later in the same show.

<br>
"It mystifies Westerners that Mikhail Gorbachev is loathed and
ridiculed in his own country. This is the man who pulled the world
several steps back from the nuclear brink and lifted a crushing
fear from his countrymen, who ended bloody foreign adventures,
liberated Eastern Europe and won for the Soviet Union at least
provisional membership in the club of civilized nations. By the
standards of the West (and by comparison with the incumbent, Boris
Yeltsin), Mr. Gorbachev is a man of impeccable character." <DD>-- New

<P>
 "But even abroad, Mrs. Clinton still
stirs up controversy at home. In a Time magazine interview she
talked about her plans to travel the U.S., monitoring the
administration's new welfare reform policies. Perhaps Mrs. Clinton
best expressed her own awkward situation when she told an
Australian audience that the only way for a First Lady to escape
criticism is to never express opinions or ideas."

<P>
Hillary Clinton:
<P>
<blockquote>
"So it's a kind of difficult position and I think
the only answer is to just be who you are and do what you do and
get through it and wait for the first man to hold the position and
see how it turns out."

<CENTER><H3>Alger Hiss: Just Caught Up in Cold War Hysteria
</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<br>
"One of the most controversial men of the post-war years has died.
Alger Hiss, at the age of 92. He was a public servant of rising
prominence in the 1930s and 1940s when suddenly he was caught up
in a spy scandal and he was accused of being a member of the
Communist Party. In 1948 he was charged with helping pass State
Department secrets to the Soviets....Despite the support of many
prominent Americans, Hiss was sent to prison for almost four
years. It's a case that still divides many people in this country,
but at the end of his life Hiss considered vindication a
declaration by a Russian General, who controlled the KGB archives,
saying that Hiss had never been a spy." <DD>-- Tom Brokaw, November 15
NBC Nightly News. On November 18 Brokaw noted that "the Russian
General admitted he didn't have access to all records."
<P>
"Alger Hiss was an accomplished lawyer and a diplomat until a man
named Whittaker Chambers accused him of being a communist who
passed state secrets to the Soviets. At congressional hearings
Hiss defended himself against a young Richard Nixon. Hiss was
ultimately convicted of perjury. He lost his livelihood and his
marriage. He protested his innocence until the very end and last
year we reported that the Russian President Boris Yeltsin said
that KGB files had supported Mr. Hiss's claim." <DD>-- Peter Jennings,
November 15 World News Tonight. On November 19 Jennings issued a
"clarification," noting that "It was actually a member of Mr.
Yeltsin's staff, General Dmitri Volkogonov, who made the
statement. He later said that the evidence wasn't conclusive."
<P>
"Hiss was a Harvard-educated lawyer with a distinguished career in
government when he was accused in 1948 of helping pass secret
documents to the Soviets. The case attracted national attention
and helped spur a period of blacklisting and hysteria over the
communist threat." <DD>-- CNN Prime News anchor Linden Soles, November 15.
<p>
<BR>
<B>Reality Check: </B>
<br>
"For the last forty years...Hiss proclaimed his innocence. But
this year, the CIA declassified and released the so-called Venona
files, translations of actual intercepts of messages sent from the
Soviet Embassy in Washington back to Moscow. One, dated 30 March
1945, talks about the activities of a high level State Department
official turned Soviet agent code named A-L-E-S, Ales. His travel
schedule matched that of Alger Hiss. At the bottom of the cable,
there's a notation by an officer at the National Security Agency
saying Ales was probably, quote, Alger Hiss."<DD> -- Meet the Press
host Tim Russert, November 24.
<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER><H3>Very Questionable Sources of Information</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<br>
"This is the problem with the Internet: wonderful in some ways,
but more crazy conspiracy theories float around. If you get your
information from talk radio and the Internet, you believe a lot of
this nutty stuff." <DD>-- Newsweek's Evan Thomas on Pierre Salinger's
TWA 800 missile claim, November 10 Inside Washington.
<P>
"But in the end, one is left with a nagging sense that the
Dole-Kemp plan doesn't add up...and with a troubling question.
Having already tried supply-side tax cuts as the route to renewed
economic glory only to discover the nation strapped with
historically large deficits, why would we do it again?" <DD>-- Peter
G. Gosselin on the Dole-Kemp campaign manifesto Trust the People,
November 3 New York Times Book Review.

CNN's Brooks Jackson is usually one of the most balanced
and least gullible reporters on TV, taking on the campaign
rhetoric of both sides. But on Friday's (December 6) Inside
Politics he seemed to have let down his guard.
<P>
    Sitting beside substitute anchor Charles Bierbauer, he told
viewers: "Well, Charles, one of the more bizarre episodes may have
gotten a little less bizarre today. Back in October, attention
focused on the Buddhist temple in California where Democrats
raised $140,000 in an event attended by Vice President Al Gore.
The Wall Street Journal, back then, quoted a Buddhist nun who had
given $5,000 as saying the money was not hers, that it had been
given to her by the real donor who did not want to be identified.
But that would be illegal, so that was news, embarrassing to the
Vice President and to the Democratic Party. Now, that Buddhist nun
has changed her story and is saying the money was hers all along.
We are told she has filed a statement with the Federal Election
Commission, which is investigating, saying the money came not from
some secret donor but from her own savings and from offerings of
persons who supported her work at the temple, Charles."
<P>
<blockquote>
    Charles Bierbauer: "And, why do we suppose Brooks that she
might have once told the Wall Street Journal the money was not
hers?"
<P>
    Jackson: "We are told in this statement that she didn't know
quite how to handle a call from this national news reporter and
told what she hoped, or thought, was a harmless lie just to get
him off the phone. Turns out it was not so harmless."
<P>
</blockquote>
    How about a more logical scenario: When called by the reporter
she innocently told the truth. After DNC lawyers panicked they
came up with a legal explanation. Indeed, the December 2 Wall
Street Journal reported that "Democratic lawyer Peter Kelly"
became "closely involved with" allegations "that fraudulent
contributions may have been made to the Democratic Party during a
fundraising event at a Buddhist temple in California. 
<blockquote>    
<P>
"Mr. Kelly is a prominent Democratic fundraiser himself and
attended the temple event. After the controversy broke, he emerged
as the temple's lawyer...On the day that this newspaper published
a front page article quoting a Buddhist monk, Man Yah Shih, saying
she gave $5,000 at the fundraiser with money that wasn't hers, Mr.
Kelly called the woman and questioned her and was told
subsequently the same thing. Ms. Shih then left her temple for a
'retreat' overseas, from which she didn't return until after the
election. She now won't talk to reporters, referring all calls to
Mr. Kelly."

Here's a sentence apparently thought "outlandish" by New
York Times Supreme Court reporter Linda Greenhouse: "The powers
not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor
prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States
respectively, or to the people."
<P>
    That's the 10th Amendment. Here's her take on the Supreme
Court's review of the Brady gun control law. From the December 6
Washington Week in Review on PBS:
<blockquote>
<P>  
  "The Brady gun control law has been challenged, on of all
things, not on gun control grounds, but on federalism grounds, on
states rights grounds, because the bill has a provision that
requires local Sheriffs, the local law enforcement officials, to
do the background checks during the five day waiting period to
make sure a prospective gun purchaser is not a convicted felon.
And the local Sheriffs, backed by the National Rifle Association,
are arguing that this violates states rights because it in effect
is a commandeering by the federal government of the processes of
local government to make the locals officials do the Fed's work. 
And on the face of it, it sounds like a sort of outlandish
argument, you know, what local law enforcement officials do is
background checks, it's a very common kind of procedure. But this
argument has a lot of force these days because this case is part
on an ongoing review at the court and in the federal courts
generally about the whole relationship between the state and
federal government. So it's quite a potent argument, actually."

Sunday's Reliable Sources showed how the CNN program,
which is supposed to critique the news media, does anything but as
panelists pounce on anyone who dares draw attention to bias. 
<P>
    The December 8 guest panelist: former Washington Post reporter
William Powers, fresh from his inaugural New Republic piece on the
media. He's now a Senior Editor of the magazine. Regulars Marty
Schram of Scripps Howard, Bernard (I only own rust colored ties)
Kalb, Howard Kurtz of The Washington Post as well as Jane Shaw of
the Los Angles Times spent an entire segment attacking Powers. One
by one they argued how preposterous they found his thesis.
<P>
    And what did Powers assert? In his December 16 New Republic
piece he showed how the networks underplayed the Clinton character
issue during the campaign. After explaining how Clinton staffers 
convinced network producers to not air some stories, Powers 
explained:
<blockquote>
<P>
    "Why, besides the skill of its practitioners, has the White
House 'outreach' worked so well? Simply put, because Clinton and
his people are, to most journalists, culturally sympathetic. What
every conservative press critic preaches, and almost every
reporter denies, is largely true: the mainstream press is liberal.
Most Washington reporters share with the Clinton aides a language,
a value system, a set of buttons. Outrage at, say, 'partial birth
infanticide' is not one of the buttons of this class. Outrage at
'right-wing abortion activists' is.
<P>
    "When conservatives huff about the cabal of liberal
journalists that is constantly plotting to slant coverage, they
are right about the effects but wrong about the cause. There is no
plotting at all: liberal bias flows from principles so deeply held
they're mostly unconscious. All of which means that, had a
Republican President been up for re-election this year, facing the
same array of ethical problems Clinton faced, the scandals would
have gotten more ink. Recall the alacrity with which the
journalism establishment seized on the sexual allegations against
Clarence Thomas, John Tower and Bob Packwood."
<P>
</blockquote>
    Of course the MRC has never seen a plot, but it would be nice
if some media people of influence would realize this "unconscious"
bias before we put "former" before their name.

Thought you could escape from Bryant Gumbel after January
3, his last Today day? Friday's New York Post brought bad news.
The Post's Josef Adalian reported: 
<blockquote>
<P>
"There's an increasingly hard-to- ignore buzz among ABC News staffer that a deal between soon-to-depart 
Today show anchor Bryant Gumbel and ABC could be a match made in 
Nielsen heaven....Over the last few days speculation among ABC News 
insiders has become commonplace that...network execs are more than 
willing to guarantee Gumbel a 10pm Thursday newsmagazine showcase 
on ABC."

<a name="COLA">
1) A congressionally appointed panel reported Wednesday that
the Consumer Price Index (CPI) has overstated inflation, thus
leading to higher than necessary entitlement program payments. For
1996 they estimated the CPI was 1.1 percent too high. ABC and CBS
approached the issue not from the view of saving taxpayer money
but from the perspective of what recipients will lose and how such
an adjustment will mean more money for the government -- as if
it's the government's money that's being improperly spent. 
<P>
<DD>
    Here's how Peter Jennings led the December 4 World News
Tonight: "We begin tonight with money. Maybe a little less for
you, depending on who you are, and certainly a little more for
Uncle Sam."
<BR>
<DD>
    Reporter Lisa Stark then explained how "One third of the
federal budget is tied to the CPI, so cutting the official
inflation measurement 1.1 percent would lower all government
payments based on the cost of living, saving the government a
trillion dollars over the next twelve years. But cutting those
payments would affect 60 million Americans, including seniors who
stand to lose an average of $100 dollars a year in Social
Security."
<BR>
<DD>
    Patrick Burns of the National Council of Senior Citizens then
asserted: "It's a very simple, stealth, back door way of balancing
the budget. And it's really not based on science, it's based o
political opportunism."
<P>
<DD>
    Of course seniors wouldn't "lose" $100. They'll still get a
hike from the current payment.
<P>
<DD>
    On Wednesday's CBS Evening News Dan Rather, as usual,
forwarded the victim angle: "A plan officially proposed in
Washington today could effect the incomes of millions of
Americans, especially those older or at the lower end of the
economic scale." 
<BR>
<DD>
    Ray Brady elaborated: "From seniors to taxpayers, a special
congressional commission fired a shot today that could be felt by
anyone getting a government check."
<p>
<dd>
    Brady aired a soundbite from commission head Michael Boskin:
"The Consumer Price Index is substantially, substantially
overstating the true change in the cost of living by about 1.1
percentage points per year."
<br>
<dd>
    Brady continued: "Sound like economic gobbledygook? The
Consumer Price Index is the nation's main measure of inflation.
Government statisticians use it to figure out how much to pay in
food stamps, school lunches and Social Security, all of which go
up or down with inflation. Take the average Social Security check:
It will rise from $724 to $745 dollars a month in January, but it
would rise to just $737 dollars, a difference of eight dollars if
the congressional commission has its way."
<br>
<dd>
    Margrit Pittman, a Social Security recipient at a senior's
center illustrated the point: "For many people who come here,
eight dollars a month is a big loss. That may be the only eight
dollars they have to ever go to the movies."
<P>
<DD>
    There you have it. Transfer $13 per month more to Social
Security recipients, instead of $21 more, and they'll no longer be
able to see a movie. 
<P>
<a name="Dornan">
2) In his Monday (December 2) USA Today "Politics" column
reporter Richard Benedetto favorably examined the Carl Rowan and
Georgie Ann Geyer books which contend racial/ethnic tensions are
rising. Near the end Benedetto asserted: "Despite the authors'
bleak outlook, however, there were signs of hope in the last
elections." Benedetto cited three examples: First, five black
Congressmen won majority white districts; second, an Asian won the
race for Governor of Washington; and third:
<BR>
<DD>
    "Newly registered Hispanic-American voters provided critical
votes in many elections, most notably in the defeat of the
bombastic Rep. Robert Dornan, R-Calif."
<P>
<a name="foodstamps">
3) An editorial in the December 4 Washington Times noted
that Congressional Budget Office figures show "that the net effect
of welfare reform will be to increase annual federal poverty
spending by 7 percent per year through 2002." AFDC, food stamps,
Medicaid, SSI, child nutrition, etc. "will increase by 50 percent
from $198 billion in 1996 to $297 billion in 2002. With inflation
projected to average 2.8 percent a year, the 7 percent nominal
increase in federal poverty spending translates into an inflation-
adjusted increase of more than 4 percent a year."
<P>
<DD>
    That isn't the picture portrayed on network news. On the
Thanksgiving Day CBS Evening News substitute anchor Harry Smith
announced: "For the first time in decades the federal government
will no longer guarantee open-ended help to the poor. Case in 
point, food stamps. As Diana Olick reports, this could mean hunger
in America will grow, even in places famous for food and plenty of it."
<BR>
<DD>
    MRC intern Joe Alfonsi transcribed Olick's report from New
Orleans. She began: "In a city that celebrates every street
corner, where Cajun spice walks out of every doorway and century
old eateries lure patrons from all walks of life a drafty downtown
soup kitchen is preparing for an onslaught."
<br>
<dd>
   Olick went on to explain that "On March 1st, a provision in the
new welfare reform law will cut off food stamps to all able bodied 
adults ages 18 to 50 with no dependents, who don't have a job."
She found one not-so-hard working victim: "37 year old Denise Lee
has been on food stamps most of her life. She doesn't want to
work, but she's now planning to get a job. She fears though that
others will turn to crime instead to pay for food."
<br>
<dd>
    Denise Lee: "They say times is hard and crime is up and this
and that but they ain't seen nothing yet. They ain't seen
nothing."
<br>
<dd>
   Olick: "In the 35 year history of the food stamp program there
has never been a cut this drastic. More than one million people
nationwide will be affected. That's nearly 2,000 people in New
Orleans alone. But lawmakers say this cut is critical and the 
success of the welfare overhaul is riding on it."
<br>
<dd>
    Olick then allowed Ohio Congressman Robert Ney to argue: "This
is going to force the federal government, and the state
government, and the local government right down to the most local
levels to talk about how to help people, how to have opportunity."
<br>
<dd>
    Olick concluded "The cut in food stamps will force many people
to go to work. But in New Orleans, where there are more people
than jobs, some, like Denise Lee are worrying how they will carry
this new financial burden once the government stops carrying 
them. Diana Olick, CBS News, New Orleans."
<p>
<dd>
    Only at CBS is a 4 percent increase considered a "drastic
cut."

4) Continuing CBS's victimization theme, MRC analyst Steve
Kaminski caught this story on homeless which aired on the December
1 CBS Evening News. Anchor John Roberts began: "All big cities
have homeless people, it's a growing problem marked by
controversy. What to do about it? Well, the city of Atlanta has an
answer: outlaw homelessness. But that approach, says Jim Axelrod,
is causing even more controversy."
<P>
<DD>
   Reporter Axelrod started by showing viewers a mother with kids
who must ride a bus each night to find shelter: "Like most
families, Xena Hampton and her kids have a bedtime ritual. Unlike
most families, their ritual is boarding a bus to find a bed.
Which, this night, takes them twenty miles away. They are
homeless, and now a new law could make them criminals."
<br>
<dd>
    Anita Beatty, homeless taskforce: "It's immoral, it's
unethical, it's, most probably, unconstitutional."
<br>
<dd>
    After another soundbite from a homeless advocate, Axelrod
continued: "The biggest problem Atlanta's homeless advocates have
with the new law is that most people targeted have nowhere else to
go. The shelters here, they say, have enough beds for one out of
seven people who need them."
<br>
<dd>
    Axelrod allowed Atlanta Council President Marvin Arrington
explain: "You've got to get up and go to work every day and that's
not being inhumane, that's caring about yourself and caring 
about the environment that you live in."
<br>
<dd>
    Axelrod also aired a clip of a Wendy's manager complaining
about a homeless man urinating in front of his restaurant, but
proceeded to end with a hit on the law: "Opponents of the law will
now head to the courts worried that Atlanta's solution to this
problem will soon spread across the country. Jim Axelrod CBS 
News, Atlanta."

humorous, quotes in the liberal media.

December 2, 1996 (Vol. Nine; No. 25)
<P>
Gumbel's Morning Devotions
<BR>
<DD>
<i>Bryant Gumbel:</i> "You write that you prayed more during your four
years in office than basically at any time in your life and yet I
think it's fair to say, and I hope this doesn't sound harsh, I
think it's fair to say, you are consistently viewed as one of the
more ineffective Presidents of modern times."
<br>
<dd>
<i>Jimmy Carter:</i> "Well, I think that's harsh and unfair, but you have
a right to your opinion."
<br>
<dd>
<i>Gumbel:</i> "It's not mine. It's what I perceive as a general view.
What do you think, if anything, that says about the power of
prayer?" -- Exchange on Today about Carter's new book, Living
Faith, November 18.
<p>
<dd>
Time Does DNC Damage Control
<br>
<dd>
"In the realm of honest graft, Clinton didn't do anything Bob Dole
didn't do; he and his party just did it with the seal of the White
House behind them." <i>-- Time's Michael Duffy and Nancy Gibbs,
November 11.</i>
<br>
<dd>
"The intricate squalor of Democratic fundraising is the news of
the moment. But here's the big surprise: funny money is a
bipartisan indulgence. Here's another: Bob Dole -- gasp! -- is in
on the game. For most of his Senate career, Dole was the pro of
the quid pro quo. No one else has been more effective at working
the filigree of legislation, digging out just the groove to let
the American government's generosity flow unimpeded to his most
loyal supporters. And the GOP generally has engaged for years in
imaginative fundraising, and favors trading that would make
anybody blush." <i>-- Time's Richard Lacayo, next page.</i>
<br>
<dd>
"Fortunately for Clinton, Dole had already blocked
campaign-finance reform and stuffed his pockets. (Ever hear of the
sugar-growing Cuban immigrant contributor or the $6 million fine
for a Republican with a money-laundering operation in Hong Kong?)"
<i>-- Time columnist Margaret Carlson, same issue.</i>
<p>
<dd>
Eleanor "Sybil" Clift
<br>
<dd>
"Let's define what we mean by attacks on Kenneth Starr. It's fair
game to point out that he is a partisan Republican, that he
defends the tobacco interests...Yes! He got his job under very
seamy circumstances. That's fair game." <i>-- Newsweek's Eleanor
Clift on the November 16 McLaughlin Group.</i>
<br>
<dd>
<b>vs.</b>
<br>
<dd>
"Watergate was a criminal conspiracy conducted out of the Oval
Office. There is nothing even remotely like that alleged against
this President. We ought to wait and see what Ken Starr says. He's
the only one who has credibility, in my mind, in bringing forth
this investigation." <i>-- Clift, later in the same show.</i>
<p>
<dd>
Fabulous Clinton Cabinet
<br>
<dd>
"Brian Williams, I have a question. You've been covering the
Clinton White House for some time. Do you think that there is any
more heroic figure, however not very visible, than Bob Rubin, who
is the Treasury Secretary?" <i>-- Tom Brokaw during NBC News election
night coverage.</i>
<p>
<dd>
Gorbachev, Impeccable Overachiever
<br>
<dd>
"It mystifies Westerners that Mikhail Gorbachev is loathed and
ridiculed in his own country. This is the man who pulled the world
several steps back from the nuclear brink and lifted a crushing
fear from his countrymen, who ended bloody foreign adventures,
liberated Eastern Europe and won for the Soviet Union at least
provisional membership in the club of civilized nations. By the
standards of the West (and by comparison with the incumbent, Boris
Yeltsin), Mr. Gorbachev is a man of impeccable character." <i>-- New
York Times foreign editor Bill Keller reviewing Gorbachev's
memoirs, October 20.</i>
<p>
<dd>
It's Her Ideas, Stupid
<br>
<dd>
<i>CBS reporter Rita Braver:</i> "But even abroad, Mrs. Clinton still
stirs up controversy at home. In a Time magazine interview she
talked about her plans to travel the U.S., monitoring the
administration's new welfare reform policies. Perhaps Mrs. Clinton
best expressed her own awkward situation when she told an
Australian audience that the only way for a First Lady to escape
criticism is to never express opinions or ideas."
<i>Hillary Clinton:</i> "So it's a kind of difficult position and I think
the only answer is to just be who you are and do what you do and
get through it and wait for the first man to hold the position and
see how it turns out." <i>-- CBS Evening News story, November 25.</i>
<p>
<dd>
Alger Hiss: Just Caught Up in Cold War Hysteria
<br>
<dd>
"One of the most controversial men of the post-war years has died.
Alger Hiss, at the age of 92. He was a public servant of rising
prominence in the 1930s and 1940s when suddenly he was caught up
in a spy scandal and he was accused of being a member of the
Communist Party. In 1948 he was charged with helping pass State
Department secrets to the Soviets....Despite the support of many
prominent Americans, Hiss was sent to prison for almost four
years. It's a case that still divides many people in this country,
but at the end of his life Hiss considered vindication a
declaration by a Russian General, who controlled the KGB archives,
saying that Hiss had never been a spy." <i>-- Tom Brokaw, November 15
NBC Nightly News. On November 18 Brokaw noted that "the Russian
General admitted he didn't have access to all records."</i>
<br>
<dd>
"Alger Hiss was an accomplished lawyer and a diplomat until a man
named Whittaker Chambers accused him of being a communist who
passed state secrets to the Soviets. At congressional hearings
Hiss defended himself against a young Richard Nixon. Hiss was
ultimately convicted of perjury. He lost his livelihood and his
marriage. He protested his innocence until the very end and last
year we reported that the Russian President Boris Yeltsin said
that KGB files had supported Mr. Hiss's claim." <i>-- Peter Jennings,
November 15 World News Tonight. On November 19 Jennings issued a
"clarification," noting that "It was actually a member of Mr.
Yeltsin's staff, General Dmitri Volkogonov, who made the
statement. He later said that the evidence wasn't conclusive."</i>
<br>
<dd>
"Hiss was a Harvard-educated lawyer with a distinguished career in
government when he was accused in 1948 of helping pass secret
documents to the Soviets. The case attracted national attention
and helped spur a period of blacklisting and hysteria over the
communist threat." <i>-- CNN Prime News anchor Linden Soles, November 15.</i>
<p>
<dd>
Reality Check:
<br>
<dd>
"For the last forty years...Hiss proclaimed his innocence. But
this year, the CIA declassified and released the so-called Venona
files, translations of actual intercepts of messages sent from the
Soviet Embassy in Washington back to Moscow. One, dated 30 March
1945, talks about the activities of a high level State Department
official turned Soviet agent code named A-L-E-S, Ales. His travel
schedule matched that of Alger Hiss. At the bottom of the cable,
there's a notation by an officer at the National Security Agency
saying Ales was probably, quote, Alger Hiss." <i>-- Meet the Press
host Tim Russert, November 24.</i>
<p>
<dd>
Very Questionable Sources of Information
<br>
<dd>
"This is the problem with the Internet: wonderful in some ways,
but more crazy conspiracy theories float around. If you get your
information from talk radio and the Internet, you believe a lot of
this nutty stuff." <i>-- Newsweek's Evan Thomas on Pierre Salinger's
TWA 800 missile claim, November 10 Inside Washington.</i>
<br>
<dd>
"But in the end, one is left with a nagging sense that the
Dole-Kemp plan doesn't add up...and with a troubling question.
Having already tried supply-side tax cuts as the route to renewed
economic glory only to discover the nation strapped with
historically large deficits, why would we do it again?" <i>-- Peter
G. Gosselin on the Dole-Kemp campaign manifesto Trust the People,
November 3 New York Times Book Review.</i>
<p>
<dd>
Fashionably Feminist Fertility
<br>
<dd>
"Julie, how did you conceive?....Was it artificial insemination?"

<FONT SIZE=+2>1)  </FONT>On Monday's CBS Evening News (November 25), 
Rita Braver reviewed First Lady Hillary Clinton's activities while
accompanying the President in Asia. Braver relayed that 
<P>
<blockquote>
"Her theme has been equality and opportunity for women, whether
speaking to thousands or to just a few. In Bangkok, she
comforted a former prostitute now dying of AIDS. And 
later made the point that if women are educated they are not
forced to turn to prostitution."  
 </blockquote>
<P>    
Following a clip of Mrs. Clinton, Braver continued:
 <P>
<blockquote>    
"But even abroad, Mrs. Clinton still stirs up controversy at
home. In a Time magazine interview, she talked about her plans
to travel the U.S., monitoring the administration's new welfare
reform policies. The White House immediately denied that 
the First Lady will have any formal role. Perhaps Mrs. Clinton
best expressed her own awkward situation when she told an
Australian audience that the only way for a First Lady to escape
criticism is never to express opinions or ideas."
<P>

    Hillary Clinton:
<P>
<blockquote>
 "So it's a kind of difficult position and I
think the only answer is to just be who you are and do what you
do and get through it and wait for the first man to hold the
position and see how that turns out."
<P> 
</blockquote>   
Braver: 
<P>
<blockquote>
"And sources close to the First Lady say she is
still struggling to define exactly what her role will be in her
husbands next term. How to do work that is important 
but not controversial. Rita Braver CBS News, Bangkok, Thailand."
</blockquote>
<P>
    Hmmm. Maybe it's not that she expresses ideas, maybe it's
the socialist ideas that she expresses that people don't like.

A CyberAlert recipient alerted me to a November 25
Reuters story on the same topic that he saw in Yahoo, from where
I downloaded the story headlined "Hillary's Role on Welfare
Played Down."
<P>
    The piece, datelined Manila, began: "Hillary Rodham Clinton
was at the center of a new controversy on Monday after she
suggested she wanted a 'formal role' in shaping policy on U.S.
welfare reform."
<P>
    Several paragraphs later the Reuters dispatch asserted:
<P>
<blockquote>
    "A draconian welfare reform measure passed by the Republican
Congress and signed into law by Clinton at the height of the
U.S. presidential campaign in October ends a 60-year guarantee
of federal aid to the poor. It is expected to deprive at least a
million people of public assistance over the next few years."

 Monday's resignation by FDA Commissioner David Kessler
received full stories on all the evening newscasts November 25.
But NBC's Robert Hager provided the most glowing assessment of
the man who fought to expand the agency's regulatory power.
<P>
    As transcribed by MRC intern Joe Alfonsi, here's Hager's NBC
Nightly News story:
<P>
<blockquote>
    "Kessler was controversial from the start, loved going after
the big guys, set the tone immediately six years ago by telling
Proctor & Gamble to get the word 'fresh' off its frozen orange
juice. When the company ignored him, Kessler began seizing the
product. P&G backed down. Later Kessler reformed the way we
label all foods, developed a whole new system for listing fat,
cholesterol, and nutrients. Kessler had a law degree from the
University of Chicago and an MD from Harvard Medical. And he was
bipartisan too, appointed by the Republican Bush, kept on by the
Democrat Clinton."
</blockquote>
<P>    
Hager continued:
<P>
<blockquote>
 "But all this was prelude to his landmark
decision to go after big tobacco, some of the nation's
wealthiest corporations. Call cigarettes a drug, he said, and
regulate them. It had been assumed that Kessler would stay in
office to defend the new regulations from tobacco companies and
see the regulations implemented, perhaps some, by next spring.
But he's reportedly being pursued by several universities and
his wife, once a Manhattan lawyer, is known to have tired of
Washington politics. Also there was recent flap over some of his
expense accounts uncovering dozens of errors and forcing Kessler
to write an $850 reimbursement check to the government. And all
along Kessler had no shortage of detractors."
</blockquote>
<P>
    Following a soundbite from Newt Gingrich on how Kessler was
too cautious in approving drugs and praise from Congressman
Henry Waxman, Hager concluded: "So Kessler will move on, leaving
history to judge the difference he may have made in American
health."
<P>
    Hager spent so much time hyping Kessler's activities as
accomplishments that NBC viewers never learned the other side
from those who thought Kessler symbolized the worst of the
nanny-state. As a November 27 Boston Herald editorial argued:
<P>
<blockquote>
"He thought -- he said -- the brand name 'Fresh Choice' was
misleading. Never mind that right under the name it said 'made
from concentrate.' With no evidence of harm but anecdotes spread
by plaintiffs lawyers so cherished by the Clinton
administration, Kessler ordered silicone breast implants off the
market. After the publication of two impeccable studies that
demolished the case against implants, Kessler has declined to
end the ban, condemning thousands of women to inferior
substitutes."

 Discussing politics with husband and wife team James
Carville and Mary Matalin on the November 24 Meet the Press,
host Tim Russert asked Matalin: 
<P>
<blockquote>
    "A week before the inauguration in January, the Supreme
Court's going to hear arguments about sexual harassment charges
filed by Paula Jones. Stuart Taylor in the American Lawyer, a
long piece where he lays out the charges by Paula Jones against
Bill Clinton, Anita Hill against Clarence Thomas and says the
evidence involving Jones is overwhelming compared to that of
Anita Hill. Mary Matalin, how big of a political story 
and a media story is this going to be?"
</blockquote>
<P>   
 Well, so far it hasn't been much of one. As far as I've seen
it still hasn't been mentioned on Nightly News or Today. In
fact, the only broadcast network coverage it's gotten was in a
late October World News Tonight story in which ABC's Jeff
Greenfield used the lack of coverage given the blockbuster
article as an example of why conservatives see liberal bias.
<P>
<BR>
<a name="5">
<hr width=33% align=left>
<P>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>5)  </FONT>Later in the same Meet the Press (November 24) Russert
played a tape of Whittaker Chambers on the old Meet the Press
radio show during which he accused Alger Hiss of being a spy.
<P>
    Two points here. First, reporters were as skeptical about
the guilt of Hiss in 1948 as they were this year when he died.
Second, after the clip, Russert actually laid out the evidence,
something Nightly News never did.
<P>
    From the Friday, August 27, 1948 at 10pm Meet the Press
radio show, here are some of the questions posed to Chambers:   
<P>
Nat Finney, Cowles Publications:
<blockquote>
<P> "I thought you left it a
little unclear as to whether you are certain in your mind, now,
whether Alger Hiss is now a member of the Communist Party or
not."
<P>
</blockquote>
    Chambers: 
<P>
<blockquote>
"I would not presume to say whether Mr. Hiss is or
is not a member of the Communist Party."
</blockquote>
<P>    
Finney:
<P>
<blockquote> "You mean to say that you have not made a check to
find out whether he, as you, has recanted."
</blockquote>
<P>    
Chambers:
<P>
<blockquote> "I have no possibility of making such a charge.
The House Committee on Un-American Activities subpoenaed me to
tell what I knew about the Communist Party at the time that Mr.
Hiss was a member. I have testified on that, I have not 
presumed to testify what he is now."
</blockquote>
<P>    
Tom Reynolds, Chicago Sun-Times:
<P>
<blockquote> "Are you prepared at this
time, to say that Alger Hiss was anything more than, in your
opinion, a Communist? Did he do anything wrong? Did he commit
any overt act? Has he been disloyal to his country?"
</blockquote>
<P>    
Chambers:
<P>
<blockquote> "I am only prepared, at this time, to say that he
was a Communist."
</blockquote>
<P>    
Reynolds:
<P>
<blockquote> "It seems to me then sir, if I may say so, that in
some respects this may be a tempest in a teapot. You say that
you think he was a Communist, you say he was a Communist but you
will not accuse him of any act that is disloyal to the United
States."
</blockquote>
<P>
    Chambers: 
<P>
<blockquote>"I am not prepared, legally, to make that charge.
My whole interest in this business has been to show that Mr.
Hiss was a Communist."
   </blockquote>
<P>
    Back to 1996, Russert explained that "Hiss sued Whittaker
Chambers for slander, for what he said on Meet the Press"
and Hiss was later convicted of perjury for his congressional
testimony "because the statute of limitations on espionage had
expired."
 <P>
    Russert then explained: "For the last 40 years until he died
last week at age 92, Alger Hiss proclaimed his innocence. But
this year, the CIA declassified and released the so called 
Venona files, translations of actual intercepts of messages sent
from the Soviet Embassy in Washington back to Moscow. One, dated
30 March, 1945, talks about the activities of a high level State 
Department official, turned Soviet agent, code named A-L-E-S,
ALES. His travel schedule matched that of Alger Hiss. At the
bottom of the cable, there's a notation by an officer at 
the National Security Agency saying ALES, A-L-E-S was probably,
quote Alger Hiss." 
<P>
    As you saw in past CyberAlerts, when Hiss died Tom Brokaw
said he was "caught up" in a spy scandal. NBC Nightly News made
no mention of the Venona files. In fact, when they were released
this past Spring, of the broadcast networks, only the CBS
Evening News did a story (by David Martin).

The last CyberAlert reported how Peter Jennings and Tom
Brokaw last Friday (November 15) suggested Alger Hiss was
vindicated before his death. Tom Brokaw said Hiss was innocently
"caught up in a spy scandal" and "considered vindication a
declaration by a Russian General...saying that Hiss had never
been a spy." Jennings claimed that "Boris Yeltsin said that KGB
files had supported Mr. Hiss's claim" of innocence.
<P>
    Since then I've come across another instance of a network
assuming he was victimized by anti-communism. On Friday's The
News with Brian Williams last week on MSNBC substitute anchor
Brigitte Quinn told viewers, as transcribed by MRC intern Joe
Alfonsi:
<P>
<blockquote> 
    "Alger Hiss was a symbol of the cold war and the McCarthy
witch hunts that haunted that era. And his public disgrace
propelled Richard Nixon to the White House. Hiss died today at 
a New York City hospital. He was four days shy of his 93rd
birthday. Hiss was a brilliant lawyer and teacher until 1948 when
a man named Whittaker Chambers accused Hiss of giving him State
Department secrets to pass to the Soviets. An ambitious
Congressman named Richard Nixon lead the prosecution against
Hiss, who was convicted and sent to prison. The publicity helped
win Nixon the vice presidential nomination in 1952. As for Hiss,
he fought for vindication for the rest of his life. In 1987 a
Russian General declared that Hiss was never a spy but a victim
of cold war hysteria."
<P>
</blockquote>
    Did she say 1987? Yes, she did.   
<P>
    On Monday's NBC Nightly News (November 18), Tom Brokaw issued
a correction:
<P>
<blockquote>
    "Last week on this program we reported on the death of Alger
Hiss, the establishment intellectual who was the center of a long
bitter debate about his Communist Party credentials and suspected
Soviet spy activity. Late in his life, we reported, he felt
vindicated by a Russian General's claim that there were no
records to support the claims that Hiss was a spy. However, the 
Russian General admitted he didn't have access to all records."
<P>
</blockquote>
    The next night, Tuesday, November 19, Peter Jennings got
around to noting his error. On World News Tonight he stated:
<P>
<blockquote>    
"We have a clarification tonight of something we reported on 
Friday. In the obituary of Alger Hiss, we reported that Russian
President Boris Yeltsin had said that KGB files supported Hiss'
contention that he had never spied for the Soviets as he insisted
all his life. It was actually a member of Mr. Yeltsin's staff,
General Dmitri Volkogonov who made the statement. He later said
that the evidence wasn't conclusive because there were other
Soviet intelligence agencies whose files were not available."
</blockquote>
<P>    
The networks have now conceded the evidence of his innocence
is not solid, but viewers never a got a full understanding of the
depth of proof of his guilt.

 Revelations about John Huang continue to make the front
pages of newspapers, but the television networks have nearly
blacked out the entire scandal. Last week we reported that of the
broadcast network evening shows only ABC's World News Tonight, on
November 12, reported that the Commerce Dept. had launched an
investigation of John Huang to see if he really cut off ties to
the Lippo Group. The last CyberAlert detailed how a series of
revelations in the Washington Post, Wall Street Journal and New
York Times never made it onto the ABC, CBS and NBC evening shows. 
<P>
    Picking up where that list left off, here's a run down on
coverage this week that I compiled with the assistance of MRC
analysts Steve Kaminski and Gene Eliasen. This review includes the
three evening shows, plus CNN's The World Today (10pm ET) as well
as GMA, This Morning and Today from Sunday through Thursday.
<P>
<blockquote>  
<UL>
<LI>  In five mornings, GMA mentioned Huang in one newscast one
morning. Today and CBS This Morning devoted half of one story.
<LI> In five evenings, ABC raised Huang in two anchor-read
items. CBS devoted one full story. In four nights (no Nightly
News on Sunday) NBC aired one anchor-read brief. 
</UL>
</blockquote>
<P>
<CENTER><H4>Sunday, November 17.</H4></CENTER>
<P>
The day after the front page of the New York Times reported that President Clinton 
had met with and discussed Indonesian policy with James Riady, the former employer
of John Huang. Also, the DNC announced that Huang was let go as
part of post-election reductions.
<P> 
       CNN's The World Today and ABC's World News Tonight: Brief
anchor-read mentions of Huang leaving the DNC. Nothing on Riady
on any show.
<P>
<CENTER><H4>Monday, November 18.</H4></CENTER>
<P>
 Los Angeles Times reported that Huang, who claimed he severed contact with Lippo 
when he joined Commerce, made 70 phone calls at Commerce to the Lippo Bank in
Los Angeles. The Washington Times reported that Huang lobbied to
open trade with Vietnam, a position advocated by his former
employer.
<P>
         In the morning, nothing on Today or This Morning. One
mention on GMA of Huang's firing. In the evening, nothing on CBS
Evening News and NBC Nightly News. On ABC Jennings did brief item
on the 70 calls. CNN's World Today aired full story by Bob
Franken on Huang-Lippo connections. Franken even noted the money
returned from an April fundraiser at a Buddhist Temple attended
by Al Gore.
<P>

     	<H4>Tuesday, November 19.</H4>

<P>
 "Close Aide to Clinton Urged Less Candor Over Indonesian" declared 
the front page New York Times headline. The Times reported that aide 
Bruce Lindsey advised describing Clinton's meetings with Indonesian billionaire 
James Riady as "social calls" though after the campaign the White House
admitted policy was discussed.
<P>
         In the morning, nothing on GMA, Today or This Morning. In
the evening, nothing on ABC, CBS or NBC. The specifics weren't
spelled out on CNN's The World Today, but Wolf Blitzer did report
on a Clinton press conference in Australia that took place at
about 9pm ET:
<P>
<blockquote> 
"Sensitive questions involving a former Democratic Party
fundraiser's activities continue to chase President Clinton here
to Australia, his first overseas trip since his re-election. At a
joint news conference with Prime Minister John Howard, President
Clinton warned reporters not to rush to judgment about all of
this, including his friend and former Democratic Party fundraiser
John Huang. He compared all of this to the highly publicized case
of Richard Jewell who was wrongly accused of planting a bomb at
the Olympic games in Atlanta."
<P>         
 Clinton: "...One of the things I would urge you to do,
remembering what happened to Mr. Jewell in Atlanta, remembering
what has happened to so many of the accusations over the last
four years that have bee made against me that turned out to be
totally baseless, I just think that we ought to make sure, we
ought to just get the facts out. And they should be reported
That's what I've encouraged everybody to do."
<P>          
Blitzer: "Mr. Clinton says he's encouraging all of his a
ides to fully cooperate and he denies that there's any official
stonewalling."
</blockquote>
<P>   
 <CENTER><H4>Wednesday, November 20</H4></CENTER>
<P>
 The above press conference is still fresh news and the DNC announces that it has 
returned $253,000 to a Thai businesswoman who had donated funds that were
really from a citizen of Thailand.
<P>          
In the morning, nothing on GMA. Both Today and This
Morning devote half of one story to Clinton's Jewell analogy.
On CBS This Morning Bill Plante reported:
<blockquote>
<P>
          "....Mr. Clinton could not avoid the controversy over
		contributions to the Democrats by wealthy Asians. Asked if his
		staff had stonewalled the issue before the election, he replied
		that he had answered all the questions asked of him and then
		compared himself with Olympic security guard Richard Jewell."
<P>
          Clinton: "One of the things I would urge you to do,
		remembering what happened to Mr. Jewell in Atlanta, remembering
		what has happened to so many of the accusations over the last
		four years that have bee made against me that turned out to be
		totally baseless."
<P>          
		Plante: "In fact, the question of whether those
		accusations are baseless or not is likely to shadow Mr. Clinton's
		next couple of years, but he's not likely to have to deal with
		them again on this trip because the next three days in Australia
		are mostly R&R. And tomorrow he gets the chance to do what he
		really wanted to do and that's 18 holes of golf with champion
		Greg Norman."
</blockquote>
<P>
  Of course, a CBS viewer would have no idea what he
stonewalled.
<P>
          In the evening, ABC aired nothing, NBC's Tom Brokaw
mentioned the Thai money return and CBS Evening News actually
aired a full story. Rita Braver highlighted the Jewell analogy:   
<blockquote>
<P>          
"Questions keep swirling around former Lippo Group Vice
President, John Huang. Appointed by the White House to a high
Commerce Department post then transferred to a job as a top
Democratic National Committee fund-raiser. And at a news
conference, the President was asked about new allegations that
his staff deliberately delayed releasing information about
Huang's activities until after the election. A major issue, newly
disclosed White House meetings where Huang and his former Lippo
boss, James Riady discussed policy matters with Mr. Clinton. But
though some contributions Huang raised may have been illegal, Mr.
Clinton compared both Huang and himself to Richard Jewell, a man
the FBI incorrectly identified as a suspect in the Atlanta
Olympics bombing."
</blockquote>
<P>
          After a clip of Clinton claiming "I just think that we
ought to make sure we've got, you know, we ought to just get the
facts out," Braver offered a tough conclusion: "But many of those
involved in the controversy have refused to discuss their roles.
And privately, some White House aides are appalled because of the
appearance created by the unusual access of the Lippo Group." 
<P>
<CENTER><H4>Thursday, November 21.</H4></CENTER>
 Nothing on any broadcast network
show. I did not get a chance to check CNN.
<P>
    Concluding his November 18 story CNN's Bob Franklin
suggested: "John Huang may have lost his job, but neither he nor
the controversy he's the center of is about the fade away.
Congressional Republicans will see to that." 
<P>
    They will have to since the networks won't.

Jimmy Carter appeared on Today Monday (November 18) to
plug his new book, "Living Faith." Here's an exchange with Bryant
Gumbel in which Gumbel implicates prayer with Carter's poor
presidential performance:
<P> 
<blockquote> 
  Gumbel: "You write that you prayed more during your four
years in office than basically at any time in your life and yet I
think it's fair to say, and I hope this doesn't sound harsh, I
think it's fair to say, you are consistently viewed as one of the
more ineffective Presidents of modern times."
<P>    
Carter: "Well, I think that's harsh and unfair, but you have
a right to your opinion."
<P>    
Gumbel: "It's not mine. It's what I perceive as a general
view. What do you think, if anything, that says about the power
of prayer?"

Thursday night NBC Nightly News aired another segment of
its Who Cares series on charitable giving. Over video of the
Statue of Liberty, Tom Brokaw began:
<blockquote>
<P>
    "She's a symbol of hope for those seeking a better life, the
words given to us by poet Emma Lazarus. So, when the welfare
reform bill was passed by Congress this year, a bill that slashed
aid to legal immigrants, deep cuts, some $22 billion dollars
philanthropist George Soros reacted immediately, creating a $50
fund and he named it after Emma Lazarus."
<P>
</blockquote>
    Brokaw asked Soros:
<blockquote> 
<P>
"You just gave a lot of money for
immigrants because you worry immigrants, in the eyes of some
people in this country, pariahs."
<P>
</blockquote>
    Brokaw continued:
<P>
<blockquote>
 "His swift and deeply personal response to
the welfare reform bill comes at a time when many are asking
whether private giving can compensate for government cuts in
social services."
<P>
</blockquote>
    Brokaw did give Arianna Huffington a chance to explain the
benefits of personal charity, but it's amazing how year after
year there are "cuts in social services" yet the budget keeps
soaring.

Boston held its Achievement in Radio Awards luncheon
Wednesday. The master of ceremonies: Charles Osgood of CBS. The
Boston Globe's Susan Bickelhaupt reported Thursday: 
<P>
<blockquote>
"As he introduced Gina (he didn't share her last name) as the one who
would hand out the awards, he took note of the catcalls and
whistles that greeted her as she took the stage in a floor-length, 
backless green gown. He then asked her to turn around, telling 
the audience, 'There are two sides to people, a front and
a back.'"
</blockquote>
<P>
    As the Boston Herald's Inside Track column observed about
Osgood making "the shapely award presenter...model her
attributes" for the crowd, "If the PC Police were there, he would
have been 'cuffed and hauled away!"

the Third International Mathematics and Science Study.

    Boston Herald: "Study Puts U.S. Math Failure Squarely on

 Thursday the MRC's Free Market Project released a joint
study conducted with a group called Consumer Alert. The study
examined 13 magazines: Better Homes & Gardens, Family Circle,
Glamour, Good Housekeeping, Ladies' Home Journal, Mademoiselle,
McCall's, Parents, Prevention, Redbook, Weight Watchers, Women's
Day, and Working Woman.
<P>
    Following is the front page summary of the 12 page study. The
entire report will soon be on our <A HREF="http://www.mediaresearch.org/">web site</A>
, but for more information, to arrange an interview or to get a copy, e-mail

<P>
High-circulation women's and family magazines use most of their
ink to focus on lifestyle issues -- relationships between dating
and married couples, parenting, home decorating, fashions and
personal care, and dieting. Surprisingly, many also deal with
public policy issues relating to government activism and women's
and families' health and safety.
<P>
A joint Consumer Alert/Media Research Center study of 13 women's
and family magazines analyzed the October 1995 through September
1996 issues for their policy-oriented coverage. Part I of the
study reviewed whether expansion of government programs was
depicted positively or negatively. Part II looked at the
magazines' depiction of risk in discussing public policy issues
relating to health and safety. The study found:
<P>
<blockquote>
<UL>
<LI> In the 13 magazines studied, there were 115 positive
portrayals of government activism and/or calls for more. There
were only 18 negative portrayals and/or calls for less.
<LI> Twenty-three stories went beyond promoting bigger government
they also asked readers to lobby government officials on behalf
of expanded government programs.
<LI> In 56 articles or mentions of science and risk issues, 35 were
one-sided and did not acknowledge a skeptical view that the risks
depicted were minor and the alarmist views presented go against
mainstream science.
<LI> According to women's magazines, recycling is always good. Out
of 15 stories that mentioned recycling, there was not one
skeptical argument presented that sometimes recycling is
impractical and wastes resources.
<LI> Women's magazines featured numerous warnings about unsafe
drinking water, yet routinely bashed chlorine as unsafe, even
though chlorine provides the most effective protection against
waterborne diseases.
</UL>
</blockquote>
<P>
<B>Recommendations:</B>
<P>
<BR> 
Look for balance in coverage of public policy
issues. Note who the spokespersons are for a particular point of
view. Is there a pattern in who is depicted as the good guys (or
gals) and bad guys? Be skeptical of articles that provide only
anecdotal information instead of scientific evidence. 
<P>

<hr width=33% align=left>
<P>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>1)  </FONT> Reporting the death of Alger Hiss, in the November 16
Washington Times, reporter Carelton Bryant noted that "Hiss's
supporters and detractors often have camped on opposite sides of
the political spectrum. Liberals, such as Adlai Stevenson and
John Foster Dulles, defended Hiss, saying charges against him
were the product of a communist witch hunt. Conservatives, such
as William F. Buckley and J. Edgar Hoover, castigated Hiss,
saying he was one of many left-leaning intellectuals swayed by
the communists' economic rhetoric during the Great Depression."
<P>
    Guess which point of view the networks took Friday night?
<P>
    On the November 15 <I>World News Tonight</I> Peter Jennings
announced:
<P>
<blockquote> 
    "We learned late today that a very controversial American had
died. Alger Hiss was an accomplished lawyer and a diplomat until
a man named Whittaker Chambers accused him a being a communist
who passed state secrets to the Soviets. At congressional
hearings Hiss defended himself against a young Richard Nixon.
Hiss was ultimately convicted of perjury. He lost his livelihood
and his marriage. He protested his innocence until the very end
and last year we reported that the Russian President Boris
Yeltsin said that KGB files had supported Mr. Hiss's claim. He
was 92 when he died today."
<P>
</blockquote>
    On CNN's <I>Prime News</I> anchor Linden Soles told viewers: 
<P>   
<blockquote>
 "Alger Hiss, the man at the center of a Cold War spy scandal,
has died at age 92. Hiss was a Harvard educated lawyer with a
distinguished career in government when he was accused in 1948 of
helping pass secret documents to the Soviets. The case attracted
national attention and helped spurn a period of blacklisting and
hysteria over the communist threat. Richard Nixon's political
career got a major boost after his aggressive efforts in Congress
against Hiss. Hiss was later convicted of perjury and spent the
rest of his life trying to clear his name."
<P>
</blockquote>
    Tom Brokaw, on NBC <I>Nightly News</I>, declared: 
<P>
<blockquote>   
 "One of the most controversial men of the post-war years has
died. Alger Hiss, at the age of 92. He was a public servant of
rising prominence in the 1930s and 1940s when suddenly he was
caught up in a spy scandal and he was accused of being a member
of the Communist Party. In 1948 he was charged with helping pass
State Department secrets to the Soviets. His case drew
unprecedented attention and he was pursued tenaciously by a
freshman Congressman -- Richard Nixon. Despite the support of
many prominent Americans, Hiss was sent to prison for almost four
years. It's a case that still divides many people in this
country, but at the end of his life Hiss considered vindication a
declaration by a Russian General, who controlled the KGB
archives, saying that Hiss had never been a spy. Alger Hiss, dead
tonight at the age of 92."
</blockquote>
<P>    
As for the vindication suggested by Jennings and Brokaw, both
were apparently referring to a 1992 statement from Soviet General
Volkogonov that the KGB archives contained no evidence that Hiss
had spied for the Soviet Union. But as even The New York Times
obituary on Saturday noted, "he conceded that he could not rule
out the possibility that some records have been overlooked or
destroyed."
<P>
    The New York Times story continued: "In 1993, Maria Schmidt,
a Hungarian historian doing research on the Hungarian secret
police, said she had discovered a stack of documents among the
files of the Interior Ministry in Budapest that implicated Mr.
Hiss as a communist spy."
<P>
    Finally, earlier this year the National Security Agency
released a 1945 message to Moscow from a Soviet spy in Washington
that identified a State Department official as an agent code-named 
"Ales." As the Times reported, "There was a notation by
someone at the National Security Agency suggesting Ales was
'probably Alger Hiss.'"

<FONT SIZE=+2>2)  </FONT> The November 13 CyberAlert reported that ABC's <I>World
News Tonight</I> on Tuesday, November 12 aired a story on the
Commerce Department launching an investigation of whether John
Huang raised money for the DNC while he was at Commerce and
whether he really cut off all contact with the Lippo Indonesian
conglomerate where he formerly worked.
<P>
    NBC <I>Nightly News</I> and CBS <I>Evening News</I> that night: No story. 
And the blackout has continued, a review of broadcast network
evening shows through November 16 found:
<P>
<ul>
 <LI>    The November 13 Washington Post reported the Commerce
Department investigation and that DNC Chairman Don Fowler
conceded the party failed the check the legitimacy of donors. The
Washington Times reported on page one that Huang met with Webster
Hubbell after Hubbell resigned but before he plead guilty: "At
the time of the meeting, Mr. Huang had been at the Commerce
Department for 15 days after his resignation as vice chairman of
the Indonesian-based Lippo Group. Hubbell was on the Lippo
payroll after his 1994 resignation and was negotiating with
independent counsel Kenneth Starr for testimony in the Whitewater
probe."

 On Friday The Washington Post's John Carmody reported:
"Senior presidential adviser George Stephanopoulos lunched in
Manhattan yesterday with ABC News President Roone Arledge and his
top aide, Joanna Bistany. Network sources say Stephanopoulos, who
has said he plans to leave the White House soon, is being
considered as a contributor to Sunday morning's This Week as the
program undergoes changes following David Brinkley's retirement
as moderator, and on other news programs, including Good Morning
America."

television ABC wants to hire another.

<FONT SIZE=+2>1)  </FONT>On ABC's World News Tonight Tuesday night November 12
reporter Jackie Judd did a piece on a new investigation of John
Huang. Neither the CBS Evening News or NBC Nightly News mentioned
a word about the subject. Judd began: "ABC News has learned it
was a review of John Huang's outgoing phone records that
triggered the investigation by the Commerce Department's
Inspector General...."
<P>
   What the records show is not known, Judd relayed, "but
congressional investigators looking into Huang's tenure at the
department want to know if he raised money for the Democratic
Party during that time and whether he violated an agreement to
cut off all business dealings with his former employer, the
Indonesian conglomerate, the Lippo Group."

    <FONT SIZE=+2>2) </FONT> On Good Morning America on Tuesday reporter Bob Zelnick
examined prospects for Republican cooperation with the White
House. About mid-way through his story Zelnick noted that "having
sustained attacks over Medicare throughout the campaign, the GOP
is in no hurry to share with Mr. Clinton the burden of reform."
<P>
    Zelnick should know. As noticed by MRC analyst Gene Eliasen,
Zelnick had begun his story by himself falsely characterizing the
Republican Medicare proposal: "Bob Dole's disappointing campaign
and Newt Gingrich's unpopularity make the Republicans a party
without a head. The GOP House freshmen of two years ago
underestimated public resistance to cuts in programs like
Medicare...."

<FONT SIZE=+2> 3) </FONT>The night after the election last week, on MSNBC's The
News with Brian Williams, the anchor conducted a live interview
with Clinton aide George Stephanopoulos. Instead of challenging
the Clinton operative, Williams set him up with some nice
softballs. Here are three of the November 6 questions:
<P>
<blockquote>
    -- "George, did the media last night and today make too much
of this magic 50 percent margin for the President, or was it
internally a big deal?"
<P>
    -- "George, recently in a New Yorker profile that I think
most would argue was very favorable about you, not only did you
mention potential plans to leave, you said, I'm paraphrasing, 'it
was time to grow up,' leading some of your detractors to say 
'what in goodness name was the senior counselor to the President
doing having not grown up, but being senior counselor to the
President.' If you can dispassionately critique your own
performance over the past four years, I'd like you to do so."
<P>
    -- "It was said of the welfare bill when it came up from the
Hill at the time that the choice for the White House was, and
this was a cynical view, either veto it as extreme or sign it and
fix it. Can you fix it?"
</blockquote>
<P>
<BR>
<a name="4">
<hr width=33% align=left>
<P>
<BR>
  <FONT SIZE=+2> 4)</FONT> Yesterday's CyberAlert reported that a November 10
Washington Post editorial incorrectly argued that many NRA-backed 
candidates, such as Colorado's Wayne Allard, lost. Tuesday's Post 
ran this correction: "In the Colorado election to replace retiring Sen.
Hank Brown, Rep. Wayne Allard was the winner last Tuesday. In an
editorial Sunday we listed him incorrectly as having lost."
<P>
    A nice start, but as MediaWatch Associate Editor Tim Graham
pointed out to me the Post had also listed "Vince Snowbarger,
Kansas," as "among the other NRA favorites who lost." In fact,
Snowbarger won his House seat race 50 percent to 45 percent for
his Democratic opponent.
<P>
    Maybe next time the Post should fact-check the Handgun 
Control Inc. press release before running it as an editorial.

<hr width=33% align=left>
<P>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>5)</FONT> Appearing on the Late Show with David Letterman Monday
night ABC Prime Time Live co-host Diane Sawyer recounted an
experience on a recent plane flight:
<P>
<blockquote>
    Diane Sawyer: "The other day, this is your worst nightmare.
It happened to me on the plane. I am sitting there, and I'd been
traveling and traveling and I'm in who knows what time zone,
there is no time zone for which I am in. And sitting next to me
is this woman who has this sumptuous bosom, there's just no other
way to put it. And something must have sublimely set in,
grandmother reveries, or something like that, and the next thing
you know thirty minutes later I wake up and my nose is right in
the cleavage. We are not talking just leaning against, I'm just
buried in there, my little nose. It's true, it's a true story.
And one eye opened and you think 'where am I?' And then the other
eye opens and you look up and there she is, and she's absolutely
benign, like God sent me a pillow. It was beautiful, it was
beautiful."
<P>
    David Letterman: "Had there been complimentary wine on the
flight? Was there a delay and everybody got an extra cocktail, is
that what happened?"
<P>
    Sawyer: "It was just temptation, like you and Morley Safer,
you know how it is."
<P>
</blockquote>

    It would be impossible to make this stuff up.

<h3>Six short odds and ends items today as we wrap-up the

charged that<a href="#1"> "the harshness of their rhetoric...frightened

<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>1)  </FONT> Past CyberAlerts have quoted examples of reporters
tagging Dole, Gingrich and conservatives as "harsh" and examples
of reporters stating as fact that it was the Republicans who
shut down the government, as if President Clinton had nothing to
do with it. Well, MRC analyst Steve Kaminski alerted me to a
media bias combo quote in which CBS reporter Bob Schieffer did
both. On the November 3 Sunday Morning Schieffer asserted: 
 <P>
<blockquote>   "Newt Gingrich has become sort of a logo for harsh
Republican rhetoric. I don't think there's anybody who would
tell you today that the Republicans maybe did not go a little
too far in the harshness of their rhetoric. They really
irritated a lot of people, poll after poll shows it, local
officials will tell you that, when they shut down the
government. They got the blame for that and I think in some 
ways it really kind of frightened people."

<hr width=33% align=left>
<P>
<BR>
  <FONT SIZE=+2>2) </FONT> UPN's "Star Trek: Voyager" episode last Wednesday,
November 6, revolved around the crew of the Voyager, which is
from the 24th Century, traveling back in time to 1996 Los
Angeles in order to avert the destruction of the Earth in the
29th Century. The cause of the future disaster: a Mr. Henry
Starling, played by Ed Begley Jr., who heads a computer company
ominously named ChronowerX.
<P>
    Because of a time-travel mess up Starling has obtained
technological know-how from a 29th Century spaceship. The
Voyager crew learns he's an evil businessman who became rich and
powerful by using this knowledge to create a new computer chip
in 1969 and dominate the new industry. They conclude the
"computer age of late 20th century shouldn't have happened." 
In order to keep the Voyager crew's arrival secret, businessman
Starling dispatches one of his goons to murder the astronomer
who alerted him to their arrival. 
   <P>
 Anyway, at one point the camera pans his office and full
screen for a couple of seconds is a picture on a table: a framed
photo of "Starling" shaking hands with President Richard Nixon.

<hr width=33% align=left>
<P>
<BR>
 <FONT SIZE=+2>3) </FONT> The November 10 Washington Post ran an editorial titled
"Slim Sales at the Polls for the NRA." A reliable source, a
CyberAlert recipient, urged me to check the editorial's content.
It reads in part: "Though the big campaign contributions from
the NRA flowed as usual this year, they didn't pay off the way
they once did. Some of the strongest opponents of responsible
handgun and assault weapon controls were among the losers."
Conveniently, the Post supplied a list of these losers: "Among
the NRA favorites who lost....In Senate races, Wayne Allard in
Colorado..."
<P>
    Wayne Allard, known to those outside the Post as Senator-elect 
Allard, captured 51 percent of the vote versus 46 percent for his 
Democratic opponent.            
<P>
<BR>
<a name="4">
<hr width=33% align=left>
<P>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>4) </FONT> While we're on the Post, the November 11 Weekly
Standard observed: "The Washington Post has editorialized
against color-blind public policies, but it has embraced
colorblindness in an area where color presumably does matter --
in describing the appearance of individuals....we read in
October 26's Post of an abduction from a garage at Tysons II
Galleria mall near Washington: 'Police describe the suspect as
muscular, about 6 feet 1 inch tall and about 190 pounds, with
short dark hair and dark eyes.'...
<P>
    "In fact, the police described the suspect as muscular and
dark-skinned...so at least the warning posters at the mall said
the next day. But the police description was too politically
incorrect to be reproduced by the Post, which is evidently more
afraid of getting angry calls from black 'community leaders'
than it is interested in helping apprehend a rapist.'"
<P>    
Indeed, that's not an isolated example. The November 9 Post
carried an account of a street robbery in D.C. suffered by
Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Here's the complete
description of the purse-snatcher as provided by the Post: "The
thief was a man of undetermined age who wore a white satin
jacket, police said."

<BR>
  <FONT SIZE=+2> 5)</FONT> Here are some poll numbers I never found the space to
run before the election. So, before they become antique:
<blockquote>
<P>
    -- A September poll of 1,000 registered voters for the
Freedom Forum (conducted by the Roper Center), found that most
who believe the media are biased think the media are biased to
the left: "Nearly one-third (31%) say coverage favors the
Democratic party, while 9% say coverage favors the GOP. More
than half (53%) regard coverage as balanced."
<P>
    -- Recall how the networks ignored many Clinton scandal
stories that newspapers covered? The same Freedom Forum/Roper
poll showed why that's relevant: "More than half of all voters
(56 percent) said they get most of their information about the
presidential campaign from television. An additional 30 percent
get most of their information from newspapers (17 percent),
radio (11 percent), or magazines (2 percent)." 
<P>
   -- A Pew Research Center for the People and the Press poll
released October 25 found: "A huge majority of voters (67%)
believe that among four leadership groups in the country, the
news media exerts too much influence on which candidate becomes
President, followed by business corporations (59%), labor unions
(45%) and the churches (15%)."

congressional leaders and Clinton will do next year:

any real way other than to brand the other guy someone who's

<FONT SIZE=+2> 2)</FONT> MRC analyst Steve Kaminski caught the loaded spin from
Time magazine on how Republican House members fared in Tuesday's
election. Writing the cover story for the November 18 issue that
was released last week, Michael Duffy and Nancy Gibbs asserted:
<P>
<blockquote>
    "Nearly half the casualties came from Gingrich's militant
class of 1994, who had pushed the Speaker hardest to the right
and demanded the deepest cuts in popular domestic programs in
their zeal for a balanced budget. Gone are at least six of 71
GOP freshmen, including Dan Frisa of New York, who was defeated
by Carolyn McCarthy, the widow of a victim of the Long Island
Rail Road shooting, who ran on a single-issue platform: gun
control."
</blockquote>
<P>
    I think 17 House Republicans lost by the latest count, so
really only about a third were freshmen. But let's do a little
math based upon Time's numbers. Six of 71 lost. That's 8.5
percent, meaning 91.5 percent of the House freshmen won. Quite a
repudiation of those "extremists." 
<P>
    Also among the Republicans who lost on Tuesday: Peter Blute
and Peter Torkildsen, two moderates who abandoned Gingrich on
some key votes and were gun control advocates.

<FONT SIZE=+2>3) </FONT> As mentioned in the last CyberAlert, on Thursday's
Larry King Live King said David Brinkley's election night
remarks reminded him of "wacko talk radio." Here's the complete
transcript of that November 7 exchange with guest Ted Koppel.
(Diane Rehmm is host of a 10am to noon talk show on a Washington
public radio station and her show is heard on NPR stations
around the country.)
<P>
<blockquote>
    Larry King: "How about the part where he said 'he's a bore,
always will be a bore.'? That sounds, someone called Diane
Rehm's radio show the other day, and this was the first I'd
heard of it, and I was driving along."
<P>  
 Ted Koppel: "I was listening to the same show, heard the same
call."
<P>
    King: "And it was a lady."
<P>
    Koppel: "Very nice lady."
<P>
    King: "And she was disappointed, very nice lady, a fan of
David Brinkley. She was very disappointed. And when I heard the
quote it sounded to me like it was Limbaugh or Liddy or Ollie
North. It was like wacko talk radio. It didn't sound like
Brinkley. In other words, Brinkley's always been irreverent, but
always kind of classy."
<P>
    Interesting to learn that while both King and Koppel listen
to a talk show, it's a public radio talk show.
<P>
    On Friday David Brinkley taped an interview with Bill
Clinton for airing on Sunday's This Week, his last show as host.
Brinkley, who had called Clinton "a bore" and said his election
night speech was full of "goddamn nonsense," began the
interview: "Before we begin I am reminded of something I wrote
years ago. 'It may be impossible to be objective,' I said. 'But
we must always be fair.' Well after a long day election day, and
seven hours on the set, what I said at the end of our election
night coverage was both impolite and unfair. And I'm sorry. I
regret it."
<P>
</blockquote>
    Brinkley had the class to apologize for interjecting his
opinion into a newscast. I await Bryant Gumbels's apology for 
insults against Republicans over the years.

<BR>

<hr width=33% align=left>
<P>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>4) </FONT> Reminding one of Nixonian thinking, last week Bill
Clinton promised to "cut out of American politics" his enemies. The
comment has hardly generated any media outrage. I've only seen
it on one TV show: CNN's Late Edition, and then only thanks to Bill
Bennett. On Sunday, November 10 host Frank Sesno raised it
during an interview with Bennett and Mario Cuomo:
   <blockquote>
<P>
 Frank Sesno to Mario Cuomo: "Mario Cuomo I need to ask you
about this, because amid all this hugging and this 'vital
center' and this other nonsense that we hear about that will
soon fade away as we actually get down to the reality, there is
this item that Bill Bennett actually caught in USA Today a
couple of days back that's a pick up from the Associated
Press quoting Bill Clinton as telling political supporters in
Arkansas that he 'will devote a lot of time,' I am quoting from
the paper here, 'going after detractors who pursued him on
Whitewater and other ethical questions.' He called political
attackers, quote, 'a cancer,' and vowed, quote 'to cut them out
of American politics.'"
<P>
    Cuomo: "Excuse me, that was President Clinton?"
<P>    
Sesno: "Yes. That is remarkable stuff. What do you make of
that?"
<P>
</blockquote>
    As Bennett observed, if the President were Republican such a
remark would cause "a firestorm" in the media.

Imus radio show on Thursday, November 7, NBC anchor Tom Brokaw
urged the Congress to forget doing anything conservative and
avoid investigations. Here are some of Brokaw's comments, as
transcribed by MRC intern Joe Alfonsi: 
<blockquote>
    Though voters kept the Congress in Republican hands Brokaw
saw no endorsement of the 1994 switch: 
    "I don't think it is a status quo election. I think there is
a kind of command, if you will, from the public to move to the
sensible center and let's get some things done....I don't think
that you can say that there's any ideological revolution as the
Republicans claimed two years ago nor do I think this President
can now say that he has this overwhelming mandate. I think what
people have cried out for is some return to common sense in
American politics. And I think that you see that reflected
already in Alfonse D'Amato, his evil twin, Skippy, apparently
has vacated his body and now he says we no longer need these
investigations of Bill and Hillary. I mean it's really one of
the remarkable turnarounds in contemporary politics."
   <P>
 Imus: "Isn't that really from Senator D'Amato covering his
own situation because he's got to run for reelection here in '98
and a lot of these exit polls here in New York suggest that
people well, hate him.
<P>
    Brokaw: "....I think that's what people want. I think that
they want politicians in Washington to solve the real problems
that are going on and when they make an assignment to a special
prosecutor or to the Justice Department, let them do that kind
of investigation....
   <P>
 "And you must remember, a lot of these new Republican
leaders, Trent Lott and others, have their own presidential
aspirations four years from now. They'll want to get things done
because I think that's the underlying message from the country
here - solve the problems. And yes there are some real problems
within the administration that need to be investigated, but
there are agencies and ways of doing that without tying up
Congress in these expensive hearings."

 <FONT SIZE=+2>6) </FONT> Finally, on the humorous front, here's a bit of what
Senator John Kerry told Katie Couric on Today Wednesday morning
after his re-election over Bill Weld: 
<blockquote>
   "The fact is that out of the last five Governors of
Massachusetts, four of them have been Republicans. People forget
that about Massachusetts. We are a reflection of the rest of the
country. We're fairly conservative, people want the same things
people want in the rest of the country."
<P>
</blockquote>
    Massachusetts conservative? Reflection of the country? This
the morning after Bob Dole got just 28 percent in the state. He
did worse only in Rhode Island. And, the day after the state's
two GOP House members were turned out. 
<P>
    As for Republican Governors, current Governor Weld is a 
Republican. Before him Democrat Michael Dukakis held the office 
for eight years and he succeeded Ed King, another Democrat who 
beat Dukakis in the 1978 primary. That means two of the last three 
have been Democrats.

<hr width=33% align=left>
1) A front page story in the November 7 Los Angeles Times
reported: "The Democratic National Committee said Wednesday that
it is returning one of its largest 1996 campaign contributions,
$325,000, to Yogesh K. Gandhi because it could not verify that he
was the source of the funds." On Thursday the DNC returned a
$50,000 donation to a Greek businessman. 
<BR><DD>
So how did the networks play this confirmation of the pre-election 
GOP charge that the DNC took money from foreign nationals, which 
is illegal? Not a word on the November 7 CBS Evening News or NBC 
Nightly News. Only ABC's World News Tonight covered it. Reporter 
Jackie Judd put the news at the top of her piece on Republican 
plans to investigate Clinton.
<P>
But Thursday's NBC Nightly News found time to report
D'Amato's announcement and to disparage the quest for information.
Jim Miklaszewski's story started with the news of cabinet
resignations, then moved to D'Amato. Here's the end of his
report: 
<BR><DD>
    Jim Miklaszewski: "One of the Clinton's chief antagonists in
Congress, Senator Alfonse D'Amato, announced his Whitewater probe
is over"
<br><dd>
    D'Amato: "I think if we get into this business of looking
like we're out to fish, to bring up something to embarrass the
President. I don't think that's good for the country."
<br><dd>
    Miklaszewski: "White House officials are under no illusions
and still expect Republicans to vigorously pursue investigations
on other fronts. But they're also encouraged that D'Amato's
announcement may signal an end to any high profile political
witch hunts. Jim Miklaszewski, NBC News, the White House."
<p>
When the Senate held four weeks of hearings chaired by
D'Amato in July and August 1995 NBC Nightly News ran a grand
total three stories. 
<P>

<hr width=33% align=left>
2) Newsweek Washington bureau chief Evan Thomas has
discovered that Paula Jones may have some credibility. On the
November 3 Inside Washington the panel discussed the new American
Lawyer article in which reporter Stuart Taylor learned that "a
comparison of the Paula Jones and Anita Hill episodes suggests
that the evidence against the President is far stronger than the
media has let on -- and far stronger than the evidence against
[Clarence] Thomas."
<BR><DD>
On the show Evan Thomas explained: "There are two witnesses
here that matter, there are two friends of Paula Jones that she
spoke to right after the alleged incident. And they do not
generally make their story available to the press, generally.
They talked to one reporter from the [Washington] Post, Mike
Isikoff, and the Post worried about whether to do this story for
a long time, finally ran a kind of somewhat diluted version of
it, and nobody talked to these women. Now, Stuart has gone back
and talked to them and they paint a pretty bad tale."
<BR><DD>
Nina Totenberg, who first publicized Hill's unsubstantiated
an uncorroborated charges, then asserted: "There are two things
in this article: one is the examination of the evidence which is
fair game and not dramatically new but very interesting and
somewhat compelling. The other is the Anita Hill argument and I
would say that's apples and oranges. This woman is going to get
her day in court or she's going to settle, one or the other."
<P>
When the Jones story first came to light Evan took a bit
different approach. On the May 7, 1994 Inside Washington he
declared:
<br><dd>
"Yes, the case is being fomented by right-wing nuts, and yes,
she is not a very credible witness, and it's really not a law
case at all...some sleazy woman with big hair coming out of the
trailer parks...I think she's a dubious witness, I really do."
<P>
The American Lawyer article has been out for two weeks. So
what has Evan Thomas put in Newsweek. MRC analyst Steve Kaminski
reports nothing appeared in this week's or last week's issue.
<P>

<a name="rage">
<hr width=33% align=left>
3) Yesterday's CyberAlert reported how at the end of ABC's
election night broadcast David Brinkley noted the creativity of
his ABC colleagues, and then charged that "Bill Clinton has none
of it. He has not a creative bone in his body. Therefore he is a
bore and will always be a bore." I also predicted that his
remarks would become big news as the journalistic community
cringed at the anti-Clinton remarks. 
<P>
Well, Thursday's newspapers brought plenty of stories and a
remark earlier election night that didn't air on ABC's Washington
affiliate. Just after Clinton finished his speech, at about
12:30am ET, this exchange occurred, as printed in the November 7
Dallas Morning News. (Rush Limbaugh on Thursday also played a tape
of Brinkley's comments.)
<br><dd>
Brinkley: "I wish to say that we all look forward with great
pleasure to four years of wonderful, inspiring speeches full of
wit, poetry, music, love and affection. More goddamn nonsense."
<br><dd>
Peter Jennings: "You can't say that on the air, Mr. Brinkley."
<br><dd>
Brinkley: "Well, I'm not on the air."
<br><dd>
Jennings: "David, we are on the air."
<br><dd>
Brinkley: "Too bad. I told you I was leaving."
<P>
<DD>Thursday night the controversy led Larry King's CNN interview
with Ted Koppel. King called the remarks "mean-spirited," and
something he'd expect from "wacko talk radio" hosts like
Limbaugh, Oliver North or G. Gordon Liddy. [There will be more of
King's comments in the next CyberAlert.]
<br><dd>
All fall reporters regularly referred to Bob Dole as "harsh,"
but no controversy erupted. Back on the February 20 Today show
Bryant Gumbel derided Pat Buchanan as "Mr. Puke-anan." 
<br><dd>
I'm still waiting for the media consternation.
<P>

<hr width=33% align=left>
4) Here are some more quotes from election night coverage on
NBC and CBS, as collated by Steve Kaminski, Geoffrey Dickens and
Joe Alfonsi.
<ul>
<li><i>Dan Rather:</i> "How concerned is the President about the potential of his being, sort of, tied down as Gulliver was by the Lilliputians, by all this scandal investigation, ethics investigations that are bound to be unleashed?"
<li><i>Dan Rather to Senator Trent Lott:</i> "True or false, that part of the Republican agenda is now to try to paralyze the White House with so-called ethics inquiries?"
<li><i>Tom Brokaw:</i> "At one point Trent Lott was talking about unleashing some investigations of fundraising and other matters at the White House. Do you think he will pull back from that once reality sets in come January?"
<li><i>Dan Rather:</i> "The Colorado Senate race has been decided. Our CBS News estimate is the seat will remain Republican with Wayne Allard finishing with roughly 51 percent and Tom Strickland somewhat below that. The Democrats thought that Wayne Allard perhaps was, 'too far right' to succeed the retiring Republican, Senator Hank Brown. Turned out to be not the case, Allard wins it for the Republicans in Colorado."
<li><i>Up next, Rather labeled a Democrat, but not as "too far left." He used a milder tag for a Minnesota Senator:</i> "No surprises here, although Paul Wellstone, the Republicans had targeted him. They thought they had him. Frequently called the most liberal member of the United States Senate, but Wellstone has returned for a second term in Minnesota."
</ul>
<P>
Brinkley may have dumped on Clinton, but here's what NBC
viewers got after Clinton's speech:
<ul>
<li><dd><i>Maria Shriver:</i> "Tom, very emotional ending to his speech. Expressed a lot of gratitude. He said he was humbled by this victory. And I don't know if you could tell, Mrs. Clinton seemed to be brushing away some tears. A lot of hugging up on that stage. A lot of tears in this audience. A tremendous amount of emotion here this evening. A lot of young people with smiles on their face but holding each other. Certainly a night that I don't think anybody here will ever forget." <br><dd>    <i>Tom Brokaw:</i> "We're watching the two couples on stage now.  They are the icons of the baby boomer generation!" <br><dd>    <i>Maria Shriver:</i> "That's true!"  <br><dd>    <i>Tom Brokaw:</i> "Bill Clinton and Al Gore and Tipper Gore and Hillary Clinton. They're handsome families." <br><dd>    <i>Maria Shriver:</i> "They're picture perfect!" <br><dd>    <i>Tom Brokaw:</i> "Right!" 
<li><i>Brokaw after 1am ET:</i> "That's 30 Rockefeller Plaza overlooking the ice-skating rink and if Bill Clinton were here tonight he'd be down there skating to his heart's delight obviously because he's been re-elected President of the United States." 
<li><i>Brokaw:</i> "We're back. Thirty Rockefeller Plaza there. I half expect to see Jimmy Cagney singing 'Yankee Doodle Dandy,' and dancing between those flags."
<li><i>Brokaw:</i> "Brian Williams, I have a question. You've been covering the Clinton White House for some time. Do you think that there is any more heroic figure, however not very visible, than Bob Rubin, who is the Treasury Secretary?"
</ul>

<hr width=33% align=left>
5) On Wednesday night's Late Show with David Letterman
actress Marisa Tomei appeared. Here's part of the interview:
<br><dd>
Letterman: "Did you vote yesterday?"
<br><dd>
Tomei: "Yes."
<br><dd>
Letterman: "Are you happy with the outcome?"
<br><dd>
Tomei: "Yeah. I'm very happy."
<br><dd>
Letterman: "Have you ever met President Clinton?"
<br><dd>
Tomei: "Yes I have."
<br><dd>
Letterman: "Where'd you meet him? At the White House?"
<br><dd>
Tomei: "Yeah. I met him at the White House."
<br><dd>
Letterman: "What was that like?"
<br><dd>
Tomei: "It was very sexy, actually. It is that whole feeling."
<br><dd>
Letterman: "Sexy in what sense? You're not talking about the President?"
<br><dd>
Tomei: "Well, it's a round room, first of all, the Oval Office."
<br><dd>
Letterman: "He's an enormous guy, isn't he?"
<br><dd>
Tomei: [taken aback, assuming a reference to Clinton's penis size]
"I don't know. [pause] I'm sure. It's why I voted for him."
<br><dd>
Letterman: "I mean he's fat, is what I was driving at."
<br><dd>
Tomei: "Oooh."
<br><dd>
Letterman: "He is fat."
<br><dd>
Tomei: "I don't think so."
<br><dd>
Letterman: "He is fat and I'm going to continue to say so."
<br><dd>
Tomei: "No, he's healthy. He's healthy."
<br><dd>
Letterman: "No, they say, you know they released his medical
records like about a month ago to show that he was okay, he can 
run for another four years. And I'm telling you they fudged,
because they said he's 215 [Letterman laughs]. Two-fifteen is
when lunch ends for this guy."
<p>
The gender gap solved. All Bob Dole had to do was meet women in a "round room."

"The government reports today that the economy slowed down over the 
summer. The Gross Domestic Product, which measures all economic 
activity, was up 2.2 percent, but that is less than half the 4.7 
percent growth in the second quarter. President Clinton who was 
campaigning in Michigan noted that many economists say a cooling 
off is necessary to keep inflation down and therefore, he thinks, 
the numbers were good news. Senator Dole on the other hand was in 
Tennessee earlier today, along with Mrs. Dole. He says the numbers 
are cause for concern. He went on to say if Mr. Clinton is re-elected 
there could be a recession." -- ABC anchor Peter Jennings, October 30

Peter Jennings: "The [2.7 percent GDP] rate is more than economists 
had projected, but in many cases, less than meets the eye." 
Bob Jamieson: "The increase in economic growth was driven by a surge 
in consumer spending. The best news came from spending for big 
appliances and furniture, which rose by nearly nine percent. But 
many economists say the report is not proof the economy is taking 
a sharp turn for the better." -- <i>World News Tonight</i>, October 27, 1992.

"The government is out with its final official report on economic 
growth before the election. And it indicates a dramatic slowdown. 
In the third quarter of the year the U.S. economy grew at an annual 
rate of just 2.2 percent, that is less than half the growth rate of 
the second quarter. It didn't take long for the presidential candidates 
to put their own spins on today's economic numbers." -- Dan Rather,

"Just one week before the election and the Bush administration says
the U.S. economy has turned the corner and started expanding again,
but there is some doubt about the accuracy of the figures, and even 
if they are accurate, they may be too little too late to help 
President Bush because it was also announced today that consumer 
confidence in the economy continues to fall." -- Rather on the 
October 27, 1992 CBS <i>Evening News</i>. The GDP figure was later 
revised upward to 3.9 percent for the 3rd quarter.

"The economy was slow, but steady going in the last quarter. Many

Dole plan to have radical tax-cutting decisively repudiated at the polls. 
That way, the death of his political career can give life to the principle 
of fiscal responsibility that he devoted so many years of that career to 
advancing. If only." -- Newsweek's Jonathan Alter, Oct. 21.

"One of the roles of a journalist is to afflict the comfortable and 
comfort the afflicted. But after the debate ended, not one network news 
anchor or commentator noted the oddness of two presidential candidates 
hankering for tax handouts. Like Clinton and Dole, the anchors and 
television pundits earn more than 99 percent of all Americans. If 
those same TV commentators made say, $35,000 a year, they might 
have been more struck by Dole and Clinton's bantering." -- U.S.

"By 1985, Reagan's economics had plunged the country into debt. 
Dole's all-out fight to lower the deficit became the defining battle 
of his career." -- Actress Blair Brown narrating <i>Frontline</i> on PBS,

"Just a year later, when he saw that supply-side economics had

"Bob Dole is running around the country saying, `Where is the 
utrage?' Where is it? We now have the Democratic Party hiding 
this guy John Huang until after the election, who was out raising 
money. You've got rafts of big contributors all listing the same 
address, which is the Democratic national headquarters. Newsweek 
says you have the ambassador to Taiwan out there soliciting huge 
gifts from people, businessmen in Taiwan and you have Buddhist 
monks and nuns who have taken vows of poverty giving big amounts

Somebody said the other day if the Republicans had done this the

<FONT SIZE=+2> 1)</FONT> If you say something less than glowing about President
Clinton, then you are "harsh." On Monday (November 4) night's
World News Tonight, ABC anchor Peter Jennings told viewers:
<blockquote>    "Some of the harshest language about the President, again
today coming from Ross Perot. Mr. Perot made only one public
appearance today, in his home state of Texas."
</blockquote>
<P>
    And here's Perot's harsh comment: "Would you allow a man with
pending criminal charges to babysit your children? It's a joke.
You wouldn't think about it."

<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>2) </FONT> In a short World News Tonight segment Monday night Sam Donaldson explained some of the changes in committee
chairmanships that would happen if Democrats take control of the
upper chamber. But only one Senator got an extremist tag:
<blockquote>    "At the Armed Services Committee, you'll find Carl Levin, far
less user friendly to the armed services, would be the chairman.
In Foreign Relations, Jesse Helms, the arch-conservative would no
longer be there. And in Labor and Foreign Relations, Ted Kennedy
would chair once again. If the President wants to try for health
care reform once more, he'd have a friendly committee there."

<P>
    Yes, he said "Labor and Foreign Relations" when he meant
Labor and Human Resources.

<BR>
     <FONT SIZE=+2>3)</FONT> MRC analyst Steve Kaminski caught CBS reporter Bill
Plante adopting liberal spin as fact on Monday's This Morning.
Looking back at the 1996 campaign, Plante asserted at one point: 
   <blockquote> "You think the campaign began here, at the Democrats' made
for TV convention? No way. It really began with this year's State
of the Union address. The President already knew he'd have no
opponent in New Hampshire and the Republicans had just stumbled
badly by shutting down the government."

<BR>
    <FONT SIZE=+2>4) </FONT> On Saturday's Capital Gang on CNN both Margaret Carlson of Time and Al Hunt of the Wall Street Journal put their liberal
hearts ahead of their political brains. 
<P>
   Margaret Carlson offered this prediction on the House races,
as transcribed by MRC intern Joe Alfonsi: "Some of the Democrats
are going to suffer from the down draft from Clinton and the
money. Some of these freshman are going to go and that's great
relief. Helen Chenoweth, her evil twin, Andrea Seastrand in
California, J.D. Hayworth, Steve Stockman, the painter from
Texas." 
<P>
   National Review's Kate O'Beirne jumped in: "More women in
Congress Margaret, what's wrong with you?" Carlson countered:
"You have to reach a certain level of competence."
<P>
    O'Beirne then predicted the GOP would hold the House. Al Hunt
agreed, but: "All the reporting that I've done, suggests that
Kate is absolutely right and I think over 90 percent of the
incumbents are going to be re-elected because it's a good year
for incumbents. But my gut tells me that two dozen of those
Gingrich robots, the freshmen, are going to bite the dust and the
Democrats are going to pick up 25 seats. Mark I'm not sure I
believe it, but it's my prediction and I'm sticking with it."
<P>
    We'll soon know if Hunt's dream of a Democratic House will
come true.

<BR>
   <FONT SIZE=+2>  5) </FONT>Why are Generation Xers (those in their 20s) turned off
by Campaign '96? Here's the explanation of Tabitha Soren from MTV
as espoused on Monday's This Morning: 
   <blockquote> "This year you have two known quantities so young people feel
like they are dealing with people who are political insiders and
that generally turns younger people off. They really feel, our
polls show, that they are disinterested and even the people who
are voting are not really happy with their choices. They feel
like they're sort of choosing between which Menendez brother do
they like better. So, a lot of them also say they'd love to turn
to a third party if they thought they could win. But I think
that's keeping a lot of people away from the process."
</blockquote>
<P>
<BR>
    Between watching all the election night coverage and going to
an election night party, I probably won't have time to do a
CyberAlert for Wednesday morning, so expect the next CyberAlert
Wednesday night/Thursday morning.

<h3>Four items today:</h3>
<p>
<ol>
<li>NPR's Mara Liasson predicts that <a href="#second">in a second term Bill Clinton will propose many new government programs,</a> but that doesn't make him a liberal.
<li><a href="#donaldson">Sam Donaldson</a> says Republicans shut the government down and asserts: "I don't think this was a Republican conservative tide in 1994."
<li>Among the DNC donors listed in the report the Democrats initially refused to release: <a href="#celebs">Hollywood celebrities from Robert Zemeckis to Danny DeVito.</a>
<li>A TV <a href="#host">network host admits supporting George McGovern</a> -- when she was seven years old.
</ol>
<a name="second">
1) A lot of little government programs add up to big government
and putting mandates on business is the latest way liberals have found
to impose their views, but that's escaped NPR's Mara Liasson. On
Washington Week in Review Friday night on PBS (November 1) Liasson
assured viewers that Republican are wrong to tag Clinton a liberal:
<br><dd>
"There's this myth that if Clinton does get the Democrats back in
control [of Congress], he'll revert to the quote 'old Bill Clinton.' The 
Republicans would like you to believe he'll become a liberal again. 
I don't think that's going to happen. I think the White House has 
prepared a second term agenda that is geared with either a razor-thin 
Democratic majority in mind, or Republicans still in control. They are 
going to be able to get the same program through no matter what. And 
it's going to be these small, incremental things, teeny tiny proposals 
that he's made this year, nothing big, no big government programs."
<P>
<a name="donaldson">
2) Republicans and conservatives may gain House and Senate seats 
on Tuesday and Bill Clinton is winning by stealing conservative issues
and claiming credit for the accomplishments of Congress, but Sam Donaldson
doesn't think the country has moved right.
<P>
In the roundtable portion of Sunday's This Week with David Brinkley
Sam Donaldson went so far from reality that even Cokie Roberts felt 
compelled to correct him:
<br><dd>
    Sam Donaldson: "George is always seeing a conservative tide. If 
three county commissioners are elected in an off season and they 
happen to be Republican conservative, you say there's a Republican 
conservative tide. I don't think this was a Republican conservative tide 
in 1994."
<br><dd>
Cokie Roberts: "How come only Democratic incumbents lost and no 
Republican incumbents lost?"
<br><dd>
Donaldson: "Because I think it was the voters saying throw the 
bums out."
<br><dd>
Roberts: "But no Republican incumbents lost."
<br><dd>
Donaldson: "But I'm taking about conservative tide. There was an 
anti-Democratic tide, absolutely, Cokie. They said throw these Democrtaic 
bums out they've had all these years in Congress and we don't like it 
and we don't like our lives and they're in."
<br><dd>George Will: "Speaking for conservatives, let's just say 1994 is 
alright with us no matter what you call it."
<br><dd>Donaldson: "Are you going to shut down the government again, did 
that strategy work?"
<P>
<a name="celebs">
3) At a campaign rally in New Jersey on Sunday, actress
Whoopi Goldberg introduced the President. While she's on the
road for the campaign, her friends in Hollywood have been writing
some large checks. When the Democratic National Committee last 
week released a donor list they initially withheld, the Washington
Times checked to see who was among those making the $10.1 million
in donations that arrived in early October. Among the names:
<ul>
<li>TV producer Norman Lear: $80,000
<li>Movie director Robert Zemeckis: $50,000
<li>Actor Robin Williams and wife Marsha: $30,000
<li>Eagles singer Don Henley: $30,000
<li>Actor Danny DeVito: $5,000
<li>Movie Director Rob Reiner: $5,000
<li>Former 20th Century Fox owner Marvin Davis: $5,000
</ul>
Meanwhile, the October 31 Washington Post had this item
in a "day in the life" story on the campaigns:
<br><dd>
"3pm, Washington. Kevin Spacey, the movie actor is touring the
Clinton-Gore headquarters....The entire Clinton-Gore Washington
operation screeches to a halt. Eventually they get Spacey to
participate in a daily campaign ritual. The staffers have taped
a sheet a butcher paper to a door. On the paper, in crayon, somebody
has drawn the White House and the number seven -- as in seven
more days and it's over. As the Olympic fanfare blares from a
boombox, and the staffers cheer him on, Spacey jumps through the
paper like Superman."
<P>
<a name="host">
4) Opening the Saturday Today show on November 2, co-host
Jodi Applegate promoted an upcoming segment. In so doing she
showed that members of the media don't grow liberal with age, 
they start out that way.
<BR><DD>
Jodi Applegate: "Did you hear about the Weekly Reader poll 
that was out this week?"
<BR><DD>
Jack Ford: "Did you used to get them in school? I loved them."
<BR><DD>
Applegate: "Oh yeah. In 1972 I voted for McGovern, because  
'govern' was in his name. This was my thinking when I was seven 
years old. Anyway, they're uncannily accurate at predicting the 
outcome of the presidential campaign so we'll take a look at why 
that might be."
<P>
How much do you want to bet that she's voting for Clinton this 
year because she thinks the C in Clinton stands for "compassion"?

<h3>Five items today:</h3>
<p>
<ol>
<li>The <a href="#huang">revelation of John Huang's frequent white house visits</a> led Thursday's Good Morning America, but were not mentioned at all on Today or This Morning.
<li>Wednesday's <a href="#nbc">NBC Nightly News</a> did not include a word about Huang, but ABC and CBS did air stories on him.
<li>ABC's Jeff Greenfield explores <a href="#bias">whether liberal bias may explain</a> why scandals don't hurt Clinton. 
<li>Five days before the election <a href="#cnn">CNN bumped Inside Politics back a half hour</a> in order to show....
<li>The November 4 edition of the MRC's <a href="#nq">Notable Quotables.</a> 
</ol>
<a name="huang">
1) <b>"DNC Fundraiser Huang Visited White House Often: Log Shows 
Him There 78 Times Since July '95"</b> declared the front page story 
in the Thursday, October 31 <i>Washington Post</i>. The <i>Washington Times</i> 
headline read: <b>"Huang Frequent White House Visitor: Also Got Unusual 
Security Clearance Waiver."</b>
<BR><DD>
So, did these headlines prompt stories on the network morning 
shows? MRC analysts Steve Kaminski and Jim Forbes told me not on CBS 
This Morning or NBC's Today. Only GMA, MRC analyst Gene Eliasen observed, 
didn't ignore the news. GMA co-host Charlie Gibson opened the show:
<BR><DD>
"The lead story involves campaign fundraising. More fuel on the 
fire of that story that has been catching heat in the latter days of 
the campaign. John Huang, the fellow who was at the center of that 
Indonesian fundraising connection for the Democrats. The people in 
the administration have been downplaying his importance, but now 
there is word he made more than sixty visits to the White House in 
the first part of this year, those visits ending right away when 
those stories about Indonesian fundraising broke, and we'll have 
that in our newscasts throughout the morning."
<P>
Tuesday morning on Good Morning America Gibson had wondered 
why there wasn't more coverage of questions about Democratic 
fundraising, suggesting that "if Republicans had done this the 
press would be killing them." (See last quote in Notable Quotables 
below.) The question remains for the other networks, but Thursday 
morning Gibson's reporting addressed his concerns.
<P>
<a name="nbc">
2) Thursday night NBC Nightly News failed to mention John 
Huang's name. Introducing a story on the Clinton campaign, Tom 
Brokaw announced: "For his part, President Clinton is attempting 
to cool off the controversies over his campaign contributions. 
NBC's Brian Williams is in California tonight ahead of the 
President's trip there."
<P>
But that was it. Williams said nothing about fundraising, 
instead reporting that "in Las Vegas he [Clinton] hit Dole on the 
tax cut plan. He reminded the audience about Dole's role, along 
with Gingrich, in shutting the government down during the winter."
<P>
Next, NBC aired a story from Lisa Myers on what will happen if 
Democrats win Congress. She began by noting that Dick Gephardt says 
"Democrats are more moderate than two years ago." She reported that 
"long time liberals who claim to have signed on to the new centrist 
agenda" would get the committee chairmanships. But she compared that 
to reality, asking Congressman Charles Rangel: "Are you committed 
to balancing the budget in six years?" Rangel shot back: "No."
<P>
On World News Tonight, Jackie Judd explored the latest on the 
John Huang front, noting the Republicans have asked if donors 
"were front men to donate money that came from illegal sources, 
and did large contributions influence foreign policy."
<P>
On the CBS Evening News Thursday, Dan Rather stated: "President 
Clinton's strategy to deal with the pre-election attacks is keep 
moving, change the subject and have aides handle damage control.
Case in point: Questions about John Huang, the Democratic fundraiser 
with easy access to heavy money interests in Asia. It now turns out 
Huang also had much easier access to the White House itself than was
previously disclosed."
<P>
Later in the show in a "Follow the Dollar" segment, a week after 
ABC did it, Linda Douglass examined John Huang's trail.
<P>
<a name="bias">
3) World News Tonight looked at why scandals don't damage 
Clinton and gave airtime to the liberal bias explanation. Peter 
Jennings introduced the October 31 story: "We have one additional 
report tonight on these many questions about the behavior, and in 
some cases the alleged behavior, of Mr. and Mrs. Clinton during 
these last few years. ABC's Jeff Greenfield tonight on what sticks 
and what doesn't and what may stick around."
<P>
<DD>Here's the end of Greenfield's piece:
<BR>
<DD>"Among Republicans, one of the most popular explanations for 
Clinton's invulnerability is a liberal media bias. And at least one 
journalist thinks the critics may have a point. A forthcoming article
in The American Lawyer magazine argues that Paula Jones' charges of 
sexual harassment against then-Governor Clinton are far more credible 
than those of Anita Hill against Judge Clarence Thomas. But the 
article's author says the Paula Jones case has been covered very 
differently."
<BR>
<DD>Stuart Taylor, The American Lawyer magazine: "Imagine if Paula Jones 
or someone just like her made allegations, just like this, with evidence
just like this, against Jesse Helms or Newt Gingrich."
Greenfield: "If the polls are right all these charges will have very
little impact on the election. But once the political season ends, they 
could cast giant cloud over a second Clinton term."
<P>
Indeed, though the American Lawyer piece has been out for a week,
as far as I know this is the first network mention.
<P>
<a name="cnn">
4) Five days before Americans vote CNN carried live coverage of 
TV talk show host Jenny Jones testifying in a Michigan murder trial 
instead of their daily politics show. CNN stayed with her past 4pm ET, 
the time for Inside Politics. She stepped down at about 4:20 and CNN 
carried Inside Politics a half hour late at 4:30pm.

<b>Gun to Our Heads</b>
<BR>
<DD>"Going into the homestretch, the campaign is taking on faint overtones 
of the old protection racket with Republicans increasingly sounding like 
the Capone gang, offering protection against Bugsy Clinton and his mob." 
<i>-- ABC's John Cochran on House GOP strategy, October 27 This Week 
introductory story.</i>
<P>
<b>The Bad News is Really Good, Good News Really Not</b>
<BR>
<DD>"The government reports today that the economy slowed down over the 
summer. The Gross Domestic Product, which measures all economic 
activity, was up 2.2 percent, but that is less than half the 4.7 
percent growth in the second quarter. President Clinton who was 
campaigning in Michigan noted that many economists say a cooling 
off is necessary to keep inflation down and therefore, he thinks, 
the numbers were good news. Senator Dole on the other hand was in 
Tennessee earlier today, along with Mrs. Dole. He says the numbers 
are cause for concern. He went on to say if Mr. Clinton is re-elected 
there could be a recession."<i> -- ABC anchor Peter Jennings, October 30 
World News Tonight.</i>
<center><b>vs.</b></center>
<DD><i>Peter Jennings:</i> "The [2.7 percent GDP] rate is more than economists 
had projected, but in many cases, less than meets the eye." 
<i>Bob Jamieson: </i>"The increase in economic growth was driven by a surge 
in consumer spending. The best news came from spending for big 
appliances and furniture, which rose by nearly nine percent. But 
many economists say the report is not proof the economy is taking 
a sharp turn for the better." <i>-- World News Tonight, October 27, 1992.</i>
<P>
<DD>"The government is out with its final official report on economic 
growth before the election. And it indicates a dramatic slowdown. 
In the third quarter of the year the U.S. economy grew at an annual 
rate of just 2.2 percent, that is less than half the growth rate of 
the second quarter. It didn't take long for the presidential candidates 
to put their own spins on today's economic numbers." <i>-- Dan Rather, 
Oct. 30 CBS Evening News.</i>
<center><b>vs.</b></center>
<DD>"Just one week before the election and the Bush administration says
the U.S. economy has turned the corner and started expanding again,
but there is some doubt about the accuracy of the figures, and even 
if they are accurate, they may be too little too late to help 
President Bush because it was also announced today that consumer 
confidence in the economy continues to fall." <i>-- Rather on the 
October 27, 1992 CBS Evening News.</i> The GDP figure was later 
revised upward to 3.9 percent for the 3rd quarter.
<P>
<DD>"The economy was slow, but steady going in the last quarter. Many 
economists were encouraged by that because it means inflation is 
under control and interest rates will stay low. But, Bob Dole has 
another vision." <i>-- Tom Brokaw, October 30 NBC Nightly News.</i>
<b>vs.</b>
<DD>"The President [Bush] tonight finally has an economic number that he 
can brag about, but at the same time consumers were checking in today 
and they're yet to be persuaded that this economy is turning around." 
<i>-- Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News, October 27, 1992.</i>
<P>
<b>Relaying Democratic Spin as Fact</b>
<BR>
<DD>"To take back the House of Representatives the Democrats need 19 seats.
And as of today it looks like they could win them. Democrats are taking 
special aim at the Republicans elected in 1994. They're endangered in 
part because their leader is so unpopular. With the help of millions
of dollars from organized labor, Democratic challengers constantly remind
voters that these freshmen supported Newt Gingrich and that together they 
shut down the government." <i>-- ABC's Cokie Roberts, October 18 World 
News Tonight.</i>
<P>
<b>Cheap Shot</b>
<BR>
<DD>"Which word are we talking about? The word to his first wife when he said, 
`Until death do us part?'" <i>-- CNN Talk Back Live host Susan Rook after the 
RNC's Ed Gillespie said Dole's "word is his bond." Quoted by Washington 
Post media reporter Howard Kurtz, October 21.</i>
<P>
<b>NBC: No Big Deal, Republicans Just as Bad</b>
<BR>
<DD>"Perot barely mentioned Republican Bob Dole, even though he also accepts 
contributions from overseas." <i>-- Gwen Ifill on Perot's speech criticizing 
Clinton's illegal foreign donations, Oct. 24 NBC Nightly News.</i>
<P>
<DD>"In a year when you talk about, corporations who give $25,000 chunks of 
money, why are people particularly outraged when people with last names 
like Cabrera and people from India and Korea and Indonesia and China 
all of a sudden get, there just seems to be a lot of foreigner bashing 
as a subtext in some of the criticism." <i>-- NBC News reporter Gwen Ifill 
on PBS's Washington Week in Review, October 25. Cabrera is now serving
 a 19-year sentence for smuggling 6,000 pounds of cocaine into the U.S.</i>
<P>
<DD>"Beyond the tedium of the day to day campaigning, there's another much 
more alarming development this year -- money. Huge amounts of money 
pouring into both parties, raising very serious questions about 
influence and conflict of interest." <i>-- Tom Brokaw opening the 
October 29 NBC Nightly News.</i>
<P>
"Of course Republicans, including Bob Dole and Jesse Helms, have also 
tapped into foreign fundraising. And none of these investigations will 
produce answers until months, or years, after election day." <i>-- Andrea 
Mitchell concluding her October 29 NBC Nightly News story.</i>
<P>
<DD>"On campaign finance, White House officials admit that both sides are 
dirty. The best defense: Republicans do it too." <i>-- Jim Miklaszewski, 
October 29 The News with Brian Williams on MSNBC.</i>
<P>
<b>Dole Was Okay When He Raised Taxes</b>
<DD>"Dole knows better. Columnist Matthew Miller has even fancifully suggested 
that the Senator's 15 percent tax cut proposal is really part of a secret 
Dole plan to have radical tax-cutting decisively repudiated at the polls. 
That way, the death of his political career can give life to the principle 
of fiscal responsibility that he devoted so many years of that career to 
advancing. If only." <i>-- Newsweek's Jonathan Alter, Oct. 21.</i>
<P>
<DD>"One of the roles of a journalist is to afflict the comfortable and 
comfort the afflicted. But after the debate ended, not one network news 
anchor or commentator noted the oddness of two presidential candidates 
hankering for tax handouts. Like Clinton and Dole, the anchors and 
television pundits earn more than 99 percent of all Americans. If 
those same TV commentators made say, $35,000 a year, they might 
have been more struck by Dole and Clinton's bantering." <i>-- U.S. 
News Senior Writer David Whitman, October 21</i>.
<P>
<DD>"By 1985, Reagan's economics had plunged the country into debt. 
Dole's all-out fight to lower the deficit became the defining battle 
of his career." <i>-- Actress Blair Brown narrating Frontline on PBS, 
October 8.</i>
<P>
"Just a year later, when he saw that supply-side economics had 
ballooned the deficit, Dole worked hard to raise government revenues 
by closing tax loopholes, and pushing through what was then the 
argest tax increase in history." <i>-- Ken Bode narrating "Bob 
Dole's Odyssey" in CNN's Democracy in America, Oct 20.</i>
<P>
<b>Charles Should Be In Charge</b>
<BR>
<DD>"Bob Dole is running around the country saying, `Where is the 
outrage?' Where is it? We now have the Democratic Party hiding 
this guy John Huang until after the election, who was out raising 
money. You've got rafts of big contributors all listing the same 
address, which is the Democratic national headquarters. Newsweek 
says you have the ambassador to Taiwan out there soliciting huge 
gifts from people, businessmen in Taiwan and you have Buddhist 
monks and nuns who have taken vows of poverty giving big amounts 
of money to the Democratic Party, and nobody seems to notice this. 
Somebody said the other day if the Republicans had done this the 
press would be killing them. Why are they getting away with this?"

<h3>Four items today:</h3>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Here today, gone tomorrow. Tuesday night the three networks led with <a href="#stories">stories of Democratic fundraising.</a> Wednesday night neither ABC's World News Tonight or the CBS Evening News mentioned anything about Democratic fundraising. Only NBC Nightly News ran a piece.
<li>A tale of two campaigns. Third quarter GDP this year was below the rate in the same quarter in 1992. This year the networks gave a straight forward account, or offered a spin that favored Clinton. Announced one anchor: <a href="#slow">"The economy was slow,</a> but steady going in the last quarter. Many economists were encouraged by that because it means inflation is under control." That's not the treatment George Bush got four years ago.
<li>ABC's Charlie Gibson cited several Clinton scandals Tuesday morning and <a href="#pressing">asked why the media aren't pressing Democrats:</a> "If the Republicans had done this the press would be killing them. Why are they getting away with this?"
<li>A talk <a href="#host">show host and a former network news anchor</a> in bed together, add a little nudity on ABC, and you get... 
</ol>
<a name="stories">
1) The current issue of Newsweek includes a story about John 
Huang and a Clinton ally in Taiwan involved in questionable fundraising 
in that island nation. Wednesday's Los Angeles Times moved the story 
further. It began:
<br><dd>
"Mark Middleton, a little-known, 34-year-old ex-White House aide 
from Arkansas, was responsible for arranging a controversial encounter 
between President Clinton and Liu Tai-ying, the chief financial manager 
of Taiwan's ruling Kuomintang Party, in September 1995, officials said 
Tuesday." The LA Times went on to report that Liu offered to donate 
$15 million to the Clinton campaign, which would be illegal.
<P>
NBC Nightly News began Wednesday night (October 30) with three 
stories in a row on the campaign. In the third, Andrea Mitchell examined 
the Taiwan angle to the DNC/John Huang fundraising activities. She 
relayed allegations that a Clinton ally was "shaking down" Taiwan 
businessmen.
<P>
ABC or CBS coverage Wednesdsay night of this or any part of the 
DNC fundraising/Huang saga: Zilch. ABC didn't even air a full campaign 
story. CBS did relay Dole's newest target, as Phil Jones reported:
<BR><DD>
"Clinton White House ethical controversies also remained high on 
Dole's agenda. He took a swipe at Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary's 
government travel, while reminding supporters what they could do with 
the money from his 15 percent tax cut."
<BR><DD>
Dole: "You ought to take a vacation instead of Hazel O'Leary flying 
around the world at your expense."
<P>
<a name="slow">
2) In late October 1992 a 3rd quarter GDP of 2.7 percent was 
announced. October 30 of this year the 3rd quarter number was released: 
Just 2.2 percent. 
<P>
Wednesday night CBS Evening News anchor Dan Rather announced the 
bad news: "The government is out with its final official report on 
economic growth before the election. And it indicates a dramatic 
slowdown. In the third quarter of the year the U.S. economy grew at 
an annual rate of just 2.2 percent, that is less than half the growth 
rate of the second quarter. It didn't take long for the presidential 
candidates to put their own spins on today's economic numbers."
<P>
Phil Jones did a story with Dole's reaction, followed by Rita Braver, 
who began: "Mr. Clinton did not mention the sharp economic slowdown in 
the last quarter. Instead, he looked at the overall numbers for the year 
and claimed things are just getting better..."
<P>
Up next, Ray Brady identified the culprit: falling consumer spending. 
Brady noted: "There's one irony here. On election day 1992 the economy 
was starting to pick up, but voters hadn't felt it yet. Remember that 
expression, 'It's the economy stupid'? And George Bush went down to 
defeat. On election day 1996 the economy seems to be slowing, but not 
enough so that most voters will be feeling it."
<P>
Why hadn't voters in 1992 "felt it"? Could it be because the media
kept putting the worst possible spin on 1992 economic news? Well, to
find out I sojourned into the MRC tape library. Let's start with CBS. 
On October 27, 1992, the day of the GDP announcement, Dan Rather 
asserted: 
<BR><DD>
"Just one week before the election and the Bush administration says
the U.S. economy has turned the corner and started expanding again, but 
there is some doubt about the accuracy of the figures, and even if they 
are accurate, they may be too little too late to help President Bush 
because it was also announced today that consumer confidence in the
economy continues to fall."
<P>
Reporter Susan Spencer reported in from the Bush campaign: "He crowed 
today at upbeat news of a third quarter growth rate of 2.7 percent, though 
some economists warned that may not hold."
<P>
Rather was right about the number being inaccurate, but not in the
direction he thought. It was later revised upward to 3.9 percent for
the 3rd quarter.
<P>
On September 4, 1992 anchor Connie Chung led the show: "Today's 
unemployment report from the government appears hopeful on the surface.
It says the nation's unemployment rate is down slightly for the second 
month in a row. But the latest decline is a result of a summer jobs 
program for teenagers. That program is about to end, and as Ray Brady 
reports, the picture ahead is bleak."
<P>
Brady: "...Bare minutes after the announcement, the Federal Reserve 
moved to cut interest rates to speed the economy. But those strikes and
layoffs at General Motors, and thousands of inner city kids soon to come
off those summer job payrolls. Those could mean bad news for next month's 
figures. After hitting a high of 7.8 percent for June, then dipping a 
tenth of a point again last month, most economists now predict next
month's jobless rate could hit 7.8 percent."
<P>
One month later, the rate fell from 7.6 to 7.5 percent. Let's go to
the October 2, 1992 CBS Evening News. Ray Brady skipped over his mistake
and offered a new reason to dismiss the good news: "Those unemployment 
lines did become a bit shorter last month, but economists say that's 
largely because many Americans simply stopped looking for work, so 
they're no longer counted as unemployed....The fact is, 17 months 
after the recovery started, the economy is stuck in neutral, partly 
because business is running scared. It's not expanding like in a 
recovery, but it is cutting back like in a recession."
<P>
In between the two unemployment reports, on the September 15, 1992 
CBS Evening News, Dan Rather began the broadcast: "Seven weeks now until 
election day and new figures out today indicate the economy is flat. 
The government officially reported today that retail sales plunged 
half a percent last month, biggest drop in five months, hardest hit 
appliances and automobiles. Another sign of a sluggish economy: 
consumer prices rose just three-tenths of a percent."
<P>
CBS was not the only culprit. Look at ABC and NBC.
<P>
<b>ABC's World News Tonight</b>
<P>
<DD>October 30, 1996:
<BR><DD>
Peter Jennings: "In politics today, the economy as viewed from 
two sides. The government reports today that the economy slowed down 
over the summer. The Gross Domestic Product, which measures all economic 
activity, was up 2.2 percent, but that is less than half the 4.7 percent 
growth in the second quarter. President Clinton who was campaigning in 
Michigan noted that many economists say a cooling off is necessary to 
keep inflation down and therefore, he thinks, the numbers were good news. 
Senator Dole on the other hand was in Tennessee earlier today, along with 
Mrs. Dole. He says the numbers are cause for concern. He went on to say 
if Mr. Clinton is re-elected there could be a recession."
<P>
<DD>October 27, 1992
<BR><DD>
Peter Jennings: "The [2.7 percent GDP] is more than economists had 
projected, but in many cases, less than meets the eye." 
<BR><DD>
Bob Jamieson: "The increase in economic growth was driven by a surge 
in consumer spending. The best news came from spending for big appliances 
and furniture, which rose by nearly nine percent. But many economists say 
the report is not proof the economy is taking a sharp turn for the better."
<BR><DD>
The next day, October 28, 1992, Jennings warned: "The President may 
complain about the news media, but the economic growth figures which he 
is so pleased about are not that definitive, according to a great many 
independent economic analysts."
<P>
<b>NBC Nightly News:</b>
<P>
<DD>October 30, 1996:
<BR><DD>
Tom Brokaw: "We're now down to five full days before the election 
and the President is mostly protecting his lead while Bob Dole is 
looking for any last minute opening. And today again he tried the 
national economy. The economy was slow, but steady going in the last 
quarter. Many economists were encouraged by that because it means 
inflation is under control and interest rates will stay low. But, 
Bob Dole has another vision. So, we begin tonight with NBC's David Bloom."
<BR><DD>
Bloom told how "Bob Dole predicted today that Bill Clinton's 
re-election would plunge the nation into another recession." Jim 
Miklaszewski then gave Clinton's more upbeat spin.
<BR>
<DD>October 27, 1992 Nightly News:
<BR><DD>
Tom Brokaw: "The President tonight finally has an economic number 
that he can brag about, but at the same time consumers were checking 
in today and they're yet to be persuaded that this economy is turning 
around. The good number is the Gross Domestic Product, that's the rate 
of economic growth July through September. It hit 2.7 percent, that's 
well above what most economists predicted. But in this unusual economy, 
that's not enough, not with another report out today showing a sharp 
drop in consumer confidence."
<P>
All this matches the Center for Media and Public Affairs finding
that "in September 1992, 98 percent of all sources on the evening news
criticized the state of the economy."
<P>
<a name="pressing">
3) Discussing the campaign with Cokie Roberts and Bill Kristol on 
Tuesday's Good Morning America, Charlie Gibson acknowledged media bias:
<BR><DD>
"Let me get to a second thing. Bob Dole is running around the country 
saying, 'Where is the outrage?' Where is it? We now have the Democratic 
Party hiding this guy John Huang until after the election, who was out 
raising money. You've got rafts of big contributors all listing the same 
address, which is the Democratic National headquarters. Newsweek says you 
have the ambassador to Taiwan out there soliciting huge gifts from people, 
businessmen in Taiwan and you have Buddhist monks and nuns who have taken 
vows of poverty giving big amounts of money to the Democratic Party, and 
nobody seems to notice this. Somebody said the other day if the Republicans 
had done this the press would be killing them. Why are they getting away 
with this?"
<P>
As noted above, Wednesday's World News Tonight didn't mention any of 
the topics raised by Gibson.
<P>
<a name="host">
4) So what are former CBS News anchor Connie Chung and husband Maury 
Povich up to? See for yourself, as USA Today's October 30 "People" section 
reported Povich's tale of the bedroom:
<BR><DD>
"Sharon Lawrence 'did me one of the great favors of all time,' the talk 
show host said on Tuesday's Fox After Breakfast. 'I've never met the woman, 
but the other night on the episode of NYPD Blue...her semi-nude shot. Connie 
and I were in bed and the shot comes on. I got very lucky. I really did. 
Thank you, Sharon Lawrence, until my dying day. One of the great nights 
of all time."
<P>
Wonder what happens when Maury orders up one of those pay-per-view 
cable movies?

<h3>Four items today:</h3>
<ol>
<li>The <a href="#dnc">Washington Post's front page story on the DNC's decision to not file a FEC report on early October activities, followed later Tuesday by a reversal of that decision, and all on a day when John Huang gave a videotaped deposition, prompted the three broadcast networks to lead with DNC finances</a> Tuesday night.  But the networks also relayed the Democratic spin: Republicans do it too. NBC reported that "White House officials admit that both sides are dirty."
<li><a href="#attack">CBS Tuesday night labeled a Clinton attack "one the harshest,"</a> but it was more than harsh, it was downright preposterous.
<li>The <a href="#nyt">New York Times charged Tuesday that Bob Dole wants to destroy 32 years of civil rights work,</a> but the newspaper counts employer paid continuing education as a "civil right."  
<li><a href="#gorby">Tom Brokaw, hosting Tuesday's MSNBC InterNight, called Mikhail Gorbachev "a courageous, far-seeing prophet"</a> and said he hopes Gorbachev returns to office. 
</ol>

<a name="dnc">
1) Viewers of Tuesday morning's Today learned that
Republicans are "doing the same thing." As transcribed by MRC
analyst Geoffrey Dickens, 
<P>
<DD><i>Katie Couric asked Tim Russert</i>: "Tim, let's talk about the big news this morning. It's that the
Democratic National Committee will not file its required final
statement of campaign finances by November 5th. Which is really
unheard of. Why are they doing this?"<BR>
<DD><i>Russert responded</i>: "Because they are afraid of what's in
there Katie, obviously. This has become an obscene process! It is
outrageous the amount of money that is pouring into both these
political parties! I do think the Democrats have probably taken
it to a new level, a lower level...."<br>
<DD><i>Couric then asked</i>: "Well Tim if Republicans are doing the
same thing what are people supposed to think?"<BR>
<DD><i>Russert</i>: "Well I think If anything comes of this is that the
American people and the media and other people of good intentions
in the political process will say,  Hey we embarrassed ourselves!
We elevated or lowered, excuse me, this political process to
levels of cynicism where the American people said,  Oh you all
take foreign money.' And they finally, finally do something to
clean up this mess. Because it has become a sewer Katie."
<P>
<i>On the CBS Evening News Tuesday night, Rita Braver concluded
her story from the trail with Clinton</i>: "Aides say he will
probably deliver a speech on campaign finance reform later in the
week, trying to paint Bob Dole and Newt Gingrich as the people
who stopped tougher laws."
<P>
<i>Tom Brokaw opened the October 29 NBC Nightly News</i>: 
    "If this campaign has an unofficial motto, it is this:  Wake
me when it's over.' But, beyond the tedium of the day to day
campaigning, there's another much more alarming development this
year -- money. Huge amounts of money pouring into both parties,
raising very serious questions about influence and conflict of
interest."
<P>
    <i>That led into story from Andrea Mitchell in which she
asserted</i>: "Of course Republicans, including Bob Dole and Jesse
Helms, have also tapped into foreign fundraising. And none of
these investigations will produce answers until months, or years,
after election day."
<P>
    Brokaw and Mitchell failed to distinguish between accepting
money from foreign nationals for campaign spending, which is
illegal, and getting money from Taiwan businessmen for a
foundation-run museum, as Helms did, which is legal.
<P>
    <i>Later, on MSNBC's The News with Brian Williams, NBC reporter
Jim Miklaszewski offered a nice spin that had the Clinton
campaign "admitting" the Republican are just a bad</i>: "On campaign
finance, White House officials admit that both sides are dirty.
The best defense: Republicans do it too."
<P>
<a name="attack">
2) Earlier in Rita Braver's piece cited above, she noted
that heckling from Ohio college students "provoked one of the
President's harshest attacks of the whole campaign on Bob Dole."
<P>
<DD><i>Clinton</i>: "I would be screaming too if I wanted a country that
took Head Start and Big Bird away from five year olds, school
lunches away from ten year years, summer jobs away from 15 year
olds and college loans away from 20 year olds."
<P>
    Harsh yes, but Braver could have noted the charge has no
basis in reality.
<P>
<a name="nyt">
3) <b>"Dole Attacks 32 Years of Civil Rights Laws"</b> declared a
October 29 <i>New York Times</i> headline. In an October 20 New York
review of Bill Clinton's civil rights record, reporter Steven
Holmes began: "In his nearly four years in office, President
Clinton has amassed a civil rights record rivaling that of any
President in the last 30 years." Holmes insisted that George Bush
and Ronald Reagan "often seemed hostile or indifferent to civil
rights issues."
<P>
As pointed out to me by MRC analyst Clay Waters, The New York
Times has a pretty broad definition of civil rights. In a box
beside the Holmes story, the paper listed "promises in the civil
rights area that President Clinton made as a candidate in 1992."
Here are some:
<ul>
<li>"Lift caps on damage awards in sex discrimination cases."
<li>"Work to pass Motor Voter bill."
<li>"Support statehood for the District of Columbia."
<li>"Require every employer to spend 1.5 percent of payroll for continuing education and training."
<li>"Expand Earned-Income Tax Credit."
</ul>
<a name="gorby">
4) Mikhail's Gorbachev's book tour brought him to MSNBC's
InterNight on Tuesday night, October 29. Tom Brokaw opened the
show:<br>
<dd>"It's likely that your view of Mikhail Gorbachev depends on
your point of view. From the perspective of the West, the former
President of the Soviet Union of course was a courageous, far-seeing 
prophet whose reforms set in motion the collapse of the Soviet 
dictatorship and the end of the Cold War."
<P>
    Thirty minutes later Brokaw concluded the interview with
another salute to the communist:<br>
<dd>"We always welcome you in this country, Mikhail Gorbachev.
We're especially pleased to have you tonight on InterNight. And
we offer our very best, of course, to Raisa Gorbachev and we hope
that you'll have a long and happy life. Perhaps one day again
we'll see you in political office in Russia. We know that you've
devoted your life to peace and to changing your country and those
of us who have gotten to know you count ourselves among the
privileged."
<P>
    From the perspective of a Western journalist, maybe, ignoring
both the internal collapse of communism despite Gorbachev's
efforts to save it and the role of Ronald Reagan.

<P>
<br>

<P>
<font size=+2>1)</font> On Friday's Washington Week in Review on PBS (October 25),
NBC's Gwen Ifill opined: "In a year when you talk about, corporations 
who give $25,00 chunks of money, why are people particularly outraged
when people with last names like Cabrera and people from India
and Korea and Indonesia and China all of a sudden get, there just
seems to be a lot of foreigner bashing as a subtext in some of
the criticism."
<P>
    It took Wall Street Journal Washington Bureau Chief Alan Murray
to tell her the obvious: "It is against the law for non-residents,
foreign companies, foreign governments to give money to political
campaigns. Now what's happening here is the money seems to be
legal residents, but some of them have admitted, I mean there was
this one woman who we talked to who admitted it wasn't her money.
Someone came and handed her $5,000, it was a money laundering
system."
<P>
    As for Cabrera, could it be that, well, he's now serving a 19-year
sentence for smuggling 6,000 pounds of cocaine into the U.S?
<p>
<br>
<a name="federal">
<p><br>
<font size=+2>2) </font> On Friday a panel of judges authorized independent counsel
Kenneth Starr to investigate whether former White House counsel
Bernard Nussbaum lied about his knowledge of Hillary Clinton's
involvement in the FBI files matter.
<P>
     On the October 28 Today Sunday morning, NBC's Tim Russert
insisted: "This is dead serious. I mean the ethical problems
of the Clinton Administration are now troubling even to the most
partisan Democrats. The incident you're talking about is that
the Attorney General of the United States, Janet Reno, requested
that the special prosecutor look into whether or not Bernard
Nussbaum, counsel to the President of the United States, lied
about Hillary Clinton's role in Travelgate. This is dead serious
stuff and I don't know how we can dismiss it nine days before an
election."
<P>
    So how much emphasis did the networks give this "dead serious"
development? In Sunday's Washington Post Howard Kurtz reported that 
"it was not reported by the three network evening newscasts" Friday 
night. 
<P>
    That's not quite true, but it was hardly a major story. The CBS 
Evening News didn't mention the news. On ABC's World News Tonight
anchor Forrest Sawyer read a brief item. And how did Russert's NBC,
where he is Washington Bureau Chief, treat a story that he insists 
can't be dismissed nine days before election day? NBC Nightly News 
offered viewers only a brief item read by anchor Brian Williams. 
<P>
    In his Post piece, Kurtz quoted Russert's reaction to Dole's
liberal bias charge: "I find it ironic that Dole is criticizing the
media for not covering all the stories we broke. Whether it's the 
Indonesian gardener or the Buddhist monks, he should be crediting
the LA Times, Washington Post, New York Times and Wall Street Journal.
I think his anger is misplaced."
<P>
    Hmmm. Which media outlets didn't Russert credit? Any of the 
networks, not even his own.
<p>
<br>
<a name="dole">
<p><br>
<br>
 <font size=+2>3) </font> Affirmative action and immigration have been winning issues 
for Republicans in California and by coincidence they are just the 
subjects that NBC's David Bloom has tagged "divisive." 
<P>
    After showing a clip of a Dole immigration ad, on the Saturday, 
October 26 NBC Nightly News, Bloom concluded: "But even many Republicans 
who believe Dole could have won here on a divisive issue like 
immigration, now say it's too late." The next night, Sunday, Bloom 
concluded his story from California: "Until now, Dole on the campaign 
stump, had largely shied away from divisive social issues like 
affirmative action for fear of alienating swing voters. Not anymore."
<p>
<br>
<a name="al">
<p><br>
<br>
<font size=+2>4)</font> In the beginning of the show story Sunday for This Week
with David Brinkley, ABC's John Cochran looked at how Republicans
are now separating themselves from Dole, suggesting to voters that
they need a check on a re-elected Clinton. He concluded with this 
bizarre analogy: "Going into the the homestretch, the campaign
is taking on feint overtones of the old protection racket with
Republicans increasingly sounding like the Capone gang, offering
protection against Bugsy Clinton and his mob."
<p>
<br>
<a name="cbs">
<p><br>
<br>
<font size=+2>5) </font> Finally, a little reality check for Clinton. Here's an excerpt 
from Friday's CBS Evening News story by Bill Plante:
<P><blockquote>
    Plante: "But while Mr. Clinton walks the high road on the stump. 
His advertising, all of which he personally approves, has been 
overwhelmingly negative. He courted young voters today with a message 
of hope. A new ad courts senior voters with a message of fear."
<P> Clinton ad: "You've worked you whole life and hoped for a secure
retirememt. That's why it's so wrong that Dole and Gingrich tried
to slash Medicare $270 billion."
<P> 
   Plante: "Never mind that the President's own budget would have
cut future Medicare spending almost as much."
</blockquote>
<P>
    Now that the election is in the bag for Clinton it's safe for the
networks to scrutinize his claims.

<li>In an address at the National Press Club on Thursday, <a href="#Perot">Ross Perot rejected the Dole campaign's overture to endorse Dole</a> and he criticized Bill Clinton's character. The three evening shows highlighted the first, but ABC's World News Tonight failed to report Perot's anti-Clinton comments. Both ABC and NBC charged that Bob Dole "lashed out" at Clinton." NBC's Gwen Ifill complained that "Perot barely mentioned Republican Bob Dole, even though he also accepts contributions from overseas." On CBS, Phil Jones said the Perot gambit demonstrates that Dole is "determined to try anything."
<li>After Wednesday's order proved fruitless, on Thursday a federal judge issued another order <a href="#huang">demanding the DNC to produce John Huang.</a> Of the broadcast network evening shows, only ABC's World News Tonight reported the effort to locate him.
<li>On CBS, Dan Rather offered an uncritical look at video of <a href="#devout">Bill Clinton hugging a "devout Catholic"</a> after convincing her that it was okay for him to veto the partial birth abortion bill.
<li>NBC's Lisa Myers contended on MSNBC that <a href="#tax">tax cuts are incompatible with balancing the budget.</a> By promising a tax cut, she charged, Bob Dole "seems to have cast aside the most enduring commitment of his 35 year career -- balancing the budget."
<li>Republican House <a href="#chenoweth">freshman Helen Chenoweth</a> told Tom Brokaw that she's "just a plain spoken Western woman." Brokaw countered on Thursday's Nightly News: "Not exactly. In her first term Chenoweth was a cheerleader for the New Right." 
</ol>
<a name="Perot">    
1) Thursday night (October 24) ABC's World News Tonight made
no mention of Perot's comments about Clinton's character. Instead,
ABC emphasized Dole's attack, saying he was "livid" when he 
criticized the media. Anchor Diane Sawyer announced: "In a speech 
in Florida Mr. Dole lashed out at the President and a lot of other 
people too."
<P>
<DD>Reporter Jim Wooten began: "Clearly frustrated by his stalled 
campaign, Senator Dole was fiercely critical today not only of the 
American media, but of the American public as well for not recognizing 
his virtues and the President's vices....As for the press, he was 
practically livid, telling an audience of the faithful in Pensacola
that the sins of the Clinton administration are being concealed by 
partisan newspapers and networks."
<BR><DD>
Dole: "Now we know the liberal media's not going to report on all 
these things because they want him re-elected. They like it the way 
it is. We need the media to tell the American people the truth and the 
truth is Bill Clinton ought to be voted out of office in a landslide."
<P>
    NBC Nightly News did run clips of Perot's attacks on Clinton, 
but in trying to lessen the damage to Clinton Gwen Ifill failed 
to distinguish between accepting money from foreign nationals, which is 
illegal, with getting money from U.S. subsidiaries of foreign companies 
or from naturalized citizens, which is legal:
<BR><DD>
    Gwen Ifill: "Ross Perot attempted to blast his way back into 
contention today with a scathing indictment of President Clinton and 
the Democratic party's fundraising tactics, which includes accepting 
money from abroad."
<BR><DD>
    Perot: "If you love this country and your children, how could you 
even consider voting for a candidate that has huge moral, ethical and 
criminal problems facing him as our country has problems to solve."
<BR><DD>
    Ifill: "Perot barely mentioned Republican Bob Dole, even though 
he also accepts contributions from overseas."
<P>
    Next, David Bloom reported in from the Dole campaign. His piece
began:
<BR><DD>
    "Spurned by Ross Perot, an admittedly frustrated Bob Dole lashed 
out today at voters"
<BR><DD>
    Dole: "Wake up America."
<BR><DD>
    Bloom: "At President Clinton's ethics."
<BR><DD>
    Dole: "This is a disgrace."
<BR><DD>
    Bloom: "And especially at the liberal media, who Dole blamed for 
trying to engineer his defeat."
<BR><DD>
    Dole: "We need the media to tell the American people the truth, 
and the truth is Bill Clinton ought to be voted out of office in a 
landslide."
<BR><DD>
    On the CBS Evening News this is how Phil Jones concluded his story
on Perot and Dole: "Perot says he finds the whole Dole request to be 
weird. Was it an act of desperation? No says one top Dole aide. He 
calls it determined, determined to try anything."
<P>
<a name="huang">
2) Last Sunday, DNC General Chairman Chris Dodd promised that 
John Huang would be made available to the media. So far, no one's been
able to find the DNC fundraiser (and former Commerce Department 
official) responsible for bringing in the illegal $250,000 from 
South Korea and hundreds of thousands of dollars in other questionable
donations from overseas. On Thursday, a federal judge took action. As
reported by Brian Ross on Thursday's World News Tonight (October 24):
<P>
    Brian Ross on John Huang: "In Washington today, a federal judge 
ordered Democratic Party lawyers into court and told them to produce 
John Huang to testify in a civil lawsuit alleging favoritism at the 
Commerce Department for big Democratic contributors. The judge's unusual 
action came after Huang could not be found at his home in Glendale 
California or when U.S. Marshall's went to an address yesterday in 
Washington that the judge had ordered the Commerce Department to 
provide..."
<P>
    Reporter Mark Litke followed with a dispatch from Jakarta on 
the Lippo conglomerate's Asian empire and ties to Clinton.
<P>
    While ABC thus updated viewers on the Indonesian scandal, neither
CBS Evening News or NBC Nightly News mentioned the scandal or Huang's
name. (CNN's Inside Politics did offer an anchor-read brief.)
<P>
<a name="devout">
3) Over video of Bill Clinton along a rope line talking with a 
teenage girl who at first is crying, then is smiling and, finally, is 
hugging Clinton, Dan Rather announced on the October 24 CBS Evening 
News: 
<BR><DD>
    "In Louisiana President Clinton had this tearful encounter today 
with a teenager. She said she was a devout Catholic and was upset with 
the President's veto of a bill banning late-term abortions. The 
President spoke with her awhile, saying he had vetoed that bill after
talking with women who might have died without the procedure. As you 
see, this seemed to satisfy the teenager who said she felt better and 
would tell her mother 'it's okay to vote for President Clinton,' 
unquote."
<P>
   Of course, Rather didn't bother telling viewers that the bill 
Clinton vetoed had a life or health of the mother exception.
<P>
<a name="tax">
4) MSNBC's News with Brian Williams on Tuesday night (October
22) ran a profile of Dole by Lisa Myers. It began:
<P>
    Lisa Myers: "The heart and soul of Dole's agenda is his economic 
program, built around the bold, some say extravagant, promise."
<BR><DD>
    Bob Dole: "We'll have a President who will cut taxes 15 percent 
across the board for every taxpayer in America."
<BR><DD>
    Myers: "With that promise, that half a trillion dollar tax cut, 
Dole seems to have cast aside the most enduring commitment of his 
35 year career -- balancing the budget."
<P>
<a name="chenoweth">
5) Thursday night Tom Brokaw narrated an "In-Depth" segment
exploring big money from special interests pouring into congressional
races. His case study: The Idaho race of GOP freshmen Helen
Chenoweth (targetted by labor unions) vs. Democrat Dan Williams.
<P>
    Brokaw asserted: "Helen Chenoweth, a controversial first term 
Republican Congresswoman."
<BR><DD>
    Chenoweth: "I don't have a clue why they would target me. I 
come from an innocuous state. I'm just a plain-spoken Western woman."
<BR><DD>
    Brokaw: "Not exactly. In her first term Chenoweth was a cheerleader 
for the New Right. Voting against an increase in the minimum wage, 
trashing traditional environmental organizations. She was a hardliner 
on gun laws. So, she is a target of big labor and conservationists."
<P>
    Brokaw didn't make any negative comments about the views espoused
by the Democratic candidate. He concluded by noting that the two
candidates have debated, "But their campaigns are trapped in a cloud 
of money, saturating the air, polluting the political process, and 
that's a loss for everyone."
<P>
    So is a campaign trapped in a cloud of media distortion, polluting
the fair and balanced dissemination of political views.

<ol>
<li>Developments on the <a href="#foreign">foreign citizen fundraising</a> front continue, but TV network viewers don't hear anything about them. On Wednesday, the Los Angeles Times reported a major DNC donor had no money of his own to donate and a federal judge issued a subpoena for John Huang, now in hiding. None of the broadcast networks reported the first item; only one reported the second, but two found time to mention the sentencing of a Dole fundraiser. 
<li>NBC's Today on Wednesday reported nothing about the campaign during its two hour broadcast, but devoted a top of the show segment to a major crisis: Denial of <a href="#toilet">toliet paper to Detroit public school students</a>. 
<li>One Wednesday newspaper headline declared that Clinton is maintaining lead in California. Another the same day relayed that Dole and <a href="#catching">Republicans are catching up</a>.
test
<li>Dole's not gaining in the polls, so what's to blame. A CBS reporter Wednesday morning suggested "that his harsh <a href="#backfired">tactics may have backfired."</a> 
<li>A wealthy <a href="#actor">Hollywood actor and producer</a> identified, on Wednesday's NBC Nightly News, what ails America: Too much concern about making money. 
</ol>
<p>
<a name="foreign">
1) <b>"$325,000 Gift to Democrats Raises New Set of Questions:
Relative of Mahatma Gandhi Who Made Donation Say's he's Now in
Debt. DNC Calls Money Legal."</b> -- October 23 <i>Los Angeles Times</I>
front page.  
<P>
    It's illegal for foreign citizens to contribute to U.S.
campaigns, so the question in the case of Gandhi is whether
his donation really came from foreign nations.
<P>
    Keeping that in mind, here's the lead of the LA Times
story:<b> "The state of California says Yogesh K. Gandhi owes
$10,000 in back taxes. His California driver's license has
been revoked because he has failed to pay his traffic fines.
Claiming pauper status, he did not pay the $20 filing fee for
his divorce.
<BR><DD>"Yet Gandhi...gave a hefty a hefty $325,000 to the Democratic
National Committee....Gandhi emerged Tuesday as the latest in
a series of campaign donors whose contributions are raising
questions about the influence of foreign money in American politics.
Like the others, Gandhi's contribution was handled by John Huang,
the DNC fundraiser who brought in a series of six-figure donations,
some of which have proven illegal or suspect."</b>
<BR><DD>Speaking of Huang, he went into hiding last week to avoid the
media. On Wednesday, a federal judge issued a subpoena for him
to appear.
<P>
    How were these two developments reported Wednesday night? The 
LA Times story was not reported by any of the three evening shows
-- not ABC's World Nes Tonight, CBS Evening News or NBC Nightly News.
<P>
    Only NBC Nightly News reported the subpoena for Huang. On
the CBS Evening News Dan Rather noted, without offering any 
specifics, how the Clinton team were trying to ignore the foreign
money angle and had asked the FEC to investigate. Eric Engberg then
did a Reality Check on how it takes years for the FEC to complete
an investigation. 
<P>
    But immediately after Engberg's piece, Dan Rather announced that
Simon Fireman, a former Dole fundraiser, had been ordered to pay $6
million in fines for laundering money to avoid contribution limits.
NBC's Tom Brokaw also mentioned Simon as he introduced a piece by
Lisa Myers on soft money fundraising by both parties. 
<P>
<a name="toilet">
2) Thirteen days until the election, but on Wednesday
Today couldn't find time for any mention of the campaign, MRC
analyst Geoffrey Dickens observed. But Today devoted the second
segment of the 7am half hour to a major crisis in Detroit:
access to toilet paper in the schools. 
<P>
    Interviewing David Snead, superintendent of the Detroit 
schools, Bryant Gumbel became enraged at the new rules which
restrict how much toilet paper students can use. He demanded:
"Hang on one second! One second! I saw a quote, one second!
David Snead I saw a quote from Charlie Fobbs. He is your Director 
of Housekeeping and Grounds for your school district. He said,
his words, 'They need to teach them, the students, to use only
the amount they need.' Isn't the matter of how much toilet paper
one needs rather personal?" 
<P>
    Gumbel's latest definition of civil rights: Unlimited access
to toilet paper. How long until Clinton proposes a federal
"Equal Access to Toilet Paper Act"?
<P>
<a name="catching">
3) Two contrasting headlines from Wednesday October 23:
<BR><DD>
    On the front page of the Los Angeles Times: <b>"Clinton Keeping 
Solid Lead Over Dole in State"</b>
<BR><DD>
    On the front page of Investor's Business Daily: <b>"California 
Vote Is Back in Play: Shrinking Gap in Polls Spurs a Heavy GOP Push"</b>
<P>
<a name="backfired">
4) On Wednesday's This Morning on CBS reporter Sandra 
Hughes offered her opinion of why Dole isn't catching up.
As caught and transcribed by MRC analyst Steve Kaminski, this is 
how she concluded her October 23 story: <b>"Dole criticized Clinton 
for raising taxes and breaking campaign promises. But over the 
past few days, his tough talking rhetoric has been noticeably 
toned down even though Dole won't admit that his harsh
tactics may have backfired."</b>
<P>
    Maybe if the media didn't condemn as "harsh" every anti-Clinton 
comment made by Dole, his pointing out some of Clinton's character
problems wouldn't have "backfired."
<p>
<a name="actor">
5) Starting this week and through election day, NBC Nightly
News is running a series called <i>"Fixing America"</i> in which various
leaders in different fields tell what they think should be done.
Wednesday night's offerings included this from actor/producer
Henry Winkler, aka "The Fonz" in Happy Days back in the 1970s:
<br><DD>
    "I think that we have to humanize America. I think that the 
worst thing that ever happened to this country was the quarterly 
report. The pride of process. The pride of what we do and the 
people who do it, the population, are being moved aside just so 
that we can show a profit three or four times a year. I think 
we're going to bottom line ouservelves into oblivion."
<P>
    Remember that before you put any money down to buy a ticket
to one of his future movies.

<h2>***Media Research Center CyberAlert***</h2>
<i>10/21/96</i><p>
<p>
</center>
<p>
<h3>Three items today:</h3>
<ol>
<li>ABC's Cokie Roberts reported that <a href="#freshmen">Newt Gingrich and the House freshmen</a> "shut down the government."
<li>The <a href="#sandinistas">Sandinistas were just "socialists"</a> according to Peter Jennings. And ABC's Beth Nissen relayed that Daniel Ortega's theme song is Beethoven's Ode to Joy and his TV ads portray him as a "Latino Gandhi."
<li>The networks ignored the pardon issue for weeks and have yet to report anything about <a href="#livingstone">Craig Livingstone's assistant Mari Anderson</a> contradicting his story on the FBI files, but Washington Post reporter Howard Kurtz thinks a panel of reporters would have raised the topics in last week's debate. 
</ol>
<a name="freshmen">
<hr>
1) On Friday's World News Tonight (October 18), ABC's Cokie
Roberts explored whether Democrats might take back control of the
House. When conservatives complain that the media are
misinforming the public about Medicare cuts and how the
Republicans closed down the government, reporters counter that
they are only reporting what "Democrats say." Well, Roberts said
they "remind voters" of how Republicans caused the shutdown, as
if no responsibility for the shutdown can be placed on Bill
Clinton. Here's the beginning of her piece:
<P>
"To take back the House of Representatives the Democrats need
19 seats. And as of today it looks like they could win them.
Democrats are taking special aim at the Republicans elected in
1994. They're endangered in part because their leader is so
unpopular. With the help of millions of dollars from organized
labor, Democratic challengers constantly remind voters that these
freshmen supported Newt Gingrich and that together they shut down
the government...."
<P>
<a name="sandinistas">
<hr>
2) Later on Friday's World News Tonight, ABC previewed
Sunday's election in Nicaragua. Peter Jennings announced:    
"Under the heading of 'Whatever Happened To' we go to visit a man
who a decade ago was a very big thorn in the American side. The
United States sent hundreds of millions of dollars to Nicaragua
to defeat the Sandinistas and Daniel Ortega was their commander.
Ultimately the socialist programs of the Sandinistas and Mr.
Ortega fell out of favor. But there is a presidential election in
Nicaragua this Sunday and Daniel Ortega is back."
<p>
Reporter Beth Nissen found that "Daniel Ortega has changed
his tune. Literally, from militaristic Sandinista songs, to
Beethoven's Ode to Joy." And, she told viewers how "The new
Daniel is portrayed in his campaign ads as contemplative,
reverent, a man who cares deeply about the poor, a kind of Latino
Gandhi."
<p>
<a name="livingstone">
<hr>
3) In a Friday piece reviewing Wednesday night's
presidential debate, Washington Post media reporter Howard Kurtz
noted how the "average citizen" questioners didn't help Dole by
asking about Clinton's ethics. Kurtz then wrote: "If reporters had
been asking the questions, you can bet there would have been
aggressive demands to know whether Clinton planned to issue any
Whitewater pardons and who had hired Craig Livingstone and why
Dole was raising the 'character' issue and so on."
<p>
Hello. Has Kurtz been on Mars the past few weeks? Print
reporters, maybe. But which of the broadcast TV network reporters
who have yet to report the six month gap in the log book of who
accessed the FBI files, the fact that Livingstone's assistant
said he knew he was improperly obtaining Bush administration
files, and who never mentioned the pardon issue for more than a
week after Clinton raised the subject on the NewsHour, did Kurtz
expect to suddenly be interested in Clinton scandals? -- Brent
Baker

<H3>Three items today:</H3>
<p>
<li><FONT  SIZE=-1>But first, a quick correction: The quote from the CBS
Evening News cited in yesterday's CyberAlert was incorrectly
attributed to Bill Plante. In fact, the quote came from Phil
Jones.</FONT>
<ol>
<li><a href="#worried">Before Wednesday night's debate reporters worried</a> about
Dole's more aggressive plan. NBC's Matt Lauer said it meant the
campaign "is now getting meaner." On CBS, Phil Jones worried
that in a "town meeting" format, Dole may be seen as "being too
mean." Dan Rather warned that Dole planned to unload a "carpet
bombing on character."
<li><a href="#face">On Face the Nation, Bob Schieffer asked</a> if Dole's tax cut
proposal is responsible for "the economic mess that the country
is in."
<li><a href="#quiz">A quiz question</a>: A man identified as a "Democratic
strategist" has been making the rounds of TV shows to provide
the pro-Clinton spin. He is married to which network
correspondent who is covering the Clinton campaign?
</ol><br>
<a name="worried">
<FONT  SIZE=+1>1)</FONT> Today show news anchor Matt Lauer opened the 7am
newscast on Wednesday (October 16) by blaming Dole for causing a
mean campaign. As transcribed by MRC analyst Geoffrey Dickens:
"Good morning everyone. The last debate of the national
political campaign is on tap for tonight in San Diego. Bob Dole
is not waiting for that debate to attack Bill Clinton's ethics.
With more on a campaign that is now getting meaner, NBC's Kelly
O'Donnell is standing by live in San Diego."
<p>
On Wednesday's CBS Evening News, reporter Phil Jones showed
a clip of him shouting questions about debate strategy at Bob
Dole as Dole got into his car:
<blockquote>
   Phil Jones: "Ethics?"<BR>
   Dole: "Maybe."<BR>
   Jones: "Do you worry about it backfiring if you get into that?"<BR>
   Dole shook his head, and Jones then explained:<p>
   "Well, attacking the President could be risky for Mr. Dole
because of the debate format. The candidates will be facing
voters who are asking the questions, not a reporter. Mr. Dole
has never been able to shed that image of a hatchet man that he
got back in his 1976 vice presidential debate and the last thing
he needs tonight is a boo, a hiss, or a gasp from one of the
questioners who thinks he's being too mean."
</blockquote>
Introducing the next story from Rita Braver on the Clinton
beat, Rather asked: "Rita, true or untrue that they're preparing
for a kind of carpet bombing on character?"
<p>
<a name="face">
<FONT  SIZE=+1>2)</FONT> Most analysts suggest that Dole's 15 percent tax cut
plan has not been a more effective campaign issue because people
don't believe he'll follow through. Not Bob Schieffer. He thinks
Dole's problem is that people believe he's committed to the
supply-side theory behind the plan. 
<p>
    On the October 6 Face the Nation, Schieffer asked Ross
Perot: "You mentioned the economic mess that the country is in.
The keystone of the Dole campaign at this point seems to be a 15
percent across the board tax cut. That seems to go against a lot
of the things that Senator Dole has said in the past. I know
that you personally would not have gone in that direction. But
do you think that is one of the reasons that the Dole campaign
is running behind as it is now? What do you think of the 15
percent tax cut? Is it at all realistic? Could that be done?"
<p>
<a name="quiz">
<FONT  SIZE=+1>3)</FONT> Quiz answer: Rita Braver, the White House correspondent for
CBS News. Her husband: Bob Barnett, a Washington lawyer who
played George Bush in mock debates with Bill Clinton in 1992. In
addition to Clinton, he served as a debate coach for Michael
Dukakis and Walter Mondale. Wednesday night he appeared on CNN
both before and after the debate, identified on screen as a
"Democratic strategist."
<p>
How convenient. Rita Braver gets the Clinton spin at work
and at home.

sent a letter to the drug czar demanding release of a Defense

Mica's letter and GOP demands to see the study were not reported

desperate and mean-spirited."

   <FONT SIZE=+2> 2)</FONT> For the Monday, October 14 World News Tonight, Peter
Jennings and crew traveled to Detroit. They found a booming city
and reported that under Clinton America's cities are on the
rebound. Here's the introduction and beginning of their story of
the state of cities this election year:
<blockquote>
Peter Jennings: "Here in Detroit itself we've noticed a
difference. It was impossible to come here in years past without
the state of the city itself being an issue. Not this year, not
here. And as ABC's Dean Reynolds reports tonight, not in many
other places as well."</blockquote>
<P>
Dean Reynolds, over video of a building being torn down: 
<blockquote>
"In Detroit this morning it was down with the old. Down with the
high-rise symbols of urban rot to be replaced by new
neighborhoods. Twenty five housing developments have started
here since the Clinton Administration took office."
Mayor Dennis Archer: "There is a sense that there is a
relationship between the city of Detroit and Washington and that
it is positive."
<P>
Reynolds: "A decade ago during the Reagan era, according to the
Mayor, only one new house was built in the entire city."
</blockquote>
<P>
<BR>
<a name="house">
<P>
<BR>
    <FONT SIZE=+2> 3)</FONT> For the October 6 Sunday Morning, CBS reporter Jerry
Bowen examined some hot House contests. As transcribed by MRC
analyst Steve Kaminski, here's how Bowen described the choice
voters face in a California district:
<blockquote>
    Jerry Bowen: "In the 22nd District along California's
central coast, freshman incumbent Andrea Seastrand is in the
fight of her political life. Challenged again by Democrat Walter
Capps, the college professor she defeated by less than 1 percent
of the vote last time. It is a contest of stark contrasts. The
55 year-old Seastrand: ultra-conservative, pro-life, pro-assault
weapons, anti-gay, anti-illegal immigrant."
<P>
</blockquote>
    After a soundbite from Republican Seastrand, Bowen continued: 
<P>
<blockquote>
"The soft spoken 62 year-old Capps, liberal down the line: abortion
rights, gay rights, gun control, opposed to the death penalty."
</blockquote>
<P>
    Has CBS ever come across an "ultra-liberal"?

<p>
<H3>Four items today:</H3>
<P>
<OL>
<LI><a href="#correction">A correction</a> and a clarification of previous MRC CyberAlerts. Plus, a fact checking error from ABC on Jack Kemp. 
<LI><a href="#flawed">A study shows a link between abortion and breast cancer,</a> but instead of giving equal time to study proponents and opponents, ABC declares it "flawed."
<LI><a href="#clinton">Thanks to Bill Clinton,</a> the President of CBS Entertainment relays, a father will be able to say good-bye to his dying daughter -- and you'll be able to see it in a prime time movie.
<LI><a href="#dole">NBC's David Bloom says Bob Dole issued his "harshest, most personal attack yet on the President."</a> ABC's John Donvan asked and answers: "Did Bob Dole attack Bill Clinton in harsh terms today? Yes he did. Plenty." Donvan concludes that by not getting too personal Dole may lose, but that's okay since "it lets the candidate play out this possibly climatic moment in his career more like a statesman, less like a nasty politician."  
</OL>
<a name="correction">
<H3>1) A clarification and a correction of two topics from MRC CyberAlerts from last week.</H3>
<P>
First, the October 8 CyberAlert reported that on Monday night
(October 7) ABC's World News Tonight and the CBS Evening News ran
fact check stories on the Dole-Clinton debate. In fact, CBS
Evening News did, but ABC's piece aired on Good Morning America,
not World News Tonight. In addition, CNN's Brooks Jackson did a
fact check piece for Inside Politics.
<P>
Second, the October 11 CyberAlert noted that unlike in 1992,
this year neither ABC's World News Tonight or CNN's Inside
Politics ran fact checking stories on the VP debate. That's
correct, but MRC analyst Gene Eliasen pointed out to me that
ABC's Good Morning America did run one Thursday morning.
<P>
<DD>ABC reporter Jack Smith asserted: "Both men indicated that
taxes are too high, right? But federal taxes as a portion of
household income are actually lower now than they were 15 years
ago. Kemp made this assertion."
<BR>
<DD>Jack Kemp: "Every time in this century we've lowered the tax
rates across the board revenues went up, not down."
<BR>
<DD>Smith: "Wrong again. The last time this was tried, in 1981,
real income tax revenues fell three years in a row and drove up
the deficit."
<P>
Reality Check: Following the 1982 recession, income tax
revenue grew consistently. As Norman Ture pointed out in Ed
Rubenstein's book The Right Data, "With the recovery beginning in
late 1982, budget receipts expanded rapidly, on the average by
slightly over 8 percent a year, through fiscal 1990."
<P>
<a name="flawed">
<H3>2) On Friday, a study appearing in the Journal of
Epidemiology and Community Health, was released.</H3> It showed that
abortion is responsible for 5,000 cases of breast cancer each
year. ABC's Peter Jennings Friday night (October 11) delivered
not a news report but a warning:
<P>
<DD>Peter Jennings: "There was a study released at Penn State
University today that you may hear a lot about this weekend. It
purports to show a connection between women who have had
abortions and the risk of developing breast cancer. And if you
see it around, remember this. It is not original research, but an
analysis of 23 earlier studies. And the National Cancer Institute
says those individual studies were actually inconclusive, and
because of that, various other scientists say today the Penn
State report is flawed."
<P>
Jennings did not have to worry: While on CNN's The World
Today Jeff Levine provided a full report about the study and its
critics, neither CBS Evening News or NBC Nightly News even
mentioned the study.
<P>
<a name="clinton">
<H3>3) CBS has turned a self-serving Clinton anecdote into a 
prime time movie.</H3> Here's an exchange from Friday's Late, Late
Show with Tom Snyder:
<P>
<DD>Les Moonves, CBS entertainment division President: "The President
did actually pitch me a movie of the week idea which we ended up
shooting....It's unusual when the President of the United States
pitches you, actually a wonderful movie of the week."
<BR>
<DD>Tom Snyder: "What was it, a young guy from Arkansas becomes
President?"
<BR>
<DD>Moonves: "No, it was about the Family and Medical Leave Act, a
true story that he was involved in where a young girl had visited
the White House. He'd come back from his morning jog, and this 13
year old girl was there in a wheelchair. The President went over
to her and she evidently was dying of leukemia and the father
went over to him and thanked the President for having passed the
Family and Medical Leave Act so he could be with his daughter.
She was going to die, but at least he could say good-bye. As the
President pitched it, I mean, he had tears in his eyes,
legitimately. It was very moving. We ended up shooting the movie
starring John Ritter as the father and the President appears in
it as himself."
<BR>
<DD>Snyder: "You will stop at nothing."
<BR>
<DD>Moonves: "I will. I'm shameless for ratings, what can I tell you.
But we're not allowed to show it until after the elections."
<P>
To get to the truth of the anecdote, do we divide by six or by two?
<P>
<a name="dole">
<H3>4) In the media lexicon, anything about character or illegality is harsh and/or nasty.<BR></H3>
 Two examples:
<BR>
<DD>Monday night (October 14) this is how David Bloom began his
NBC Nightly News story: "In his harshest, most personal attack
yet on the President, Bob Dole today charged that the Clinton
Administration is unethical, that Bill Clinton himself is
slipping and sliding away from questions about possible illegal
campaign contributions."
<BR>
<DD>The night before, on ABC's World News Sunday, anchor Carole
Simpson asked: "The candidates are back on the road, but will
they take the high road or the low road?"
<BR>
<DD>Reporter John Donvan observed: "Did Bob Dole attack Bill
Clinton in harsh terms today? Yes he did. Plenty."
<BR>
<DD>Dole: "Drug use has doubled because nothing has been done in
this administration. He's been AWOL. He's been AWOL before, but
now he's really been AWOL now."
<BR>
<DD>Donvan: "But did Dole get personal, dig into the President's
past, stir up the mud of Whitewater and other issues of
character? No, he isn't. And despite being urged to do so by some
members of his own party. Dole in person is still taking the high
road, hitting the President hard on his record but not going
after Clinton on his personal life and moral character. Some in
Dole's camp wish that he'd get nastier at this point with polls
delivering constant bad news to the campaign."
<P>
Following a clip of Dole saying he's "thinking about" being
tougher and a soundbite from Jack Kemp, Donvan concluded his
story: "Dole himself continues to be the gentleman on the stump.
That may make for a duller campaign than some would like, and
perhaps a losing one. But it lets the candidate play out this
possibly climatic moment in his career more like a statesman,
less like a nasty politician. John Donvan, ABC News, Hamilton New
Jersey."
<P>
Just what reporters want. Dole to lose while not damaging Clinton.

<p>
<br>
<a name="conservative">
<br>
<br>
<br>
<font size=+2>1)</font>On Thursday's CBS Evening News, reporter Phil Jones
concluded his piece on the Dole campaign with a conservative spin
on Kemp's debate performance: 
    "In private, off the record discussions, with both Dole and
Kemp aides there's a strong sense of disappointment in Kemp's
debate performance. They talk about missed opportunities, the
feeling that Kemp let the Vice President take credit for issues
like welfare reform. As one Dole aide asked cynically, 'Did he
study much?'"
<P>
<br>
<a name="extreme">
<P>
<br>
<br>
<font size=+2>2)</font>)Later in the October 10 CBS broadcast, Bob Schieffer
traveled to Ohio's 6th CD which encompasses the southern part of
the Buckeye state. For the House seat, Republican freshman Frank
Cremeans faces his 1994 opponent, Democrat Ted Strickland.
Schieffer stated as fact that the Republican House shut the
government down, ignoring the at least equal role of the
President in refusing to sign continuing resolutions or
appropriation bills. 
<P>
    Here's the second half of the story:
<P>
Schieffer: "Now the two are back for a re-match that typifies the
predicament many Republican freshmen are finding. The revolution
and its talk of changing things like Medicare backfired with some
voters. Just ask the Republican county chairman here."<br>
Roger Bennett, Clinton County Republican Chairman: "I think
they've lost confidence in Newt Gingrich."<br>
Schieffer: "Remember, he's the Republican, not the Democratic
chairman. Why is that? Did you just go too far?"<br>
Bennett: "I think he went too far and I think if you make a
mistake you back up and say, 'darn it I made a mistake,' and you
go back and do it over again the right way."<br>
Schieffer: "Where did he make the mistake? In shutting down the
government."<br>
Bennett: "I think that is the big thing because it involved all
the older people They were really concerned. It scared the
Dickens out of them."<br>
<P>
<br>
   Having established the GOP as the culprits for the shutdown,
Schieffer concluded by endorsing the Democratic candidate's view
that House Republicans are extremists:
<br>
Schieffer: "One reason Republican Cremeans, a Gingrich stalwart
in Washington, stresses the local angle here. Is your opponent
running against Newt Gingrich or is he running against you.
Cremeans: "Well, you'd have to ask him that. What I've tried to
do is represent the district."<br>
Schieffer: "For sure, his opponent promises the same. He's
learned a lesson too."<br>
Strickland: "And that lesson is that people want moderation and
when extremes are presented, whether they be from the left or
from the right, I think people have a tendency to turn away from
that."<br>
Schieffer: "Obvious perhaps, but as Fall comes to the heartland
and the election draws near, dozens of Republican freshmen are
running scared, wondering if it's a lesson they learned in time.
Bob Schieffer, CBS News, Chillicothe Ohio."<br>
<P>
<br>
<a name="fact">
<P>
<br>
<br>
 <font size=+2> 3)</font> After the 1992 VP debate, both ABC's World News Tonight
and CNN's Inside Politics ran fact checking stories which were
dominating by corrections of Dan Quayle. This year, The
Washington Post ran a piece October 10 citing errors made by Kemp
and Gore. The Post identified five errors made by Gore. But, this
year neither ABC or CNN ran a reality check piece.
<P>
    Of course, you can't always trust the fact checkers. Post
reporter Michael Weisskopf offered this "correction" on Kemp:
"Kemp...defended the tax proposal by arguing that every tax cut
in the 20th century has produced higher government revenue. But
many economists disagree. The huge Reagan tax cut in 1981
resulted in a tripling of the budget deficit over a dozen years."
<P>
   Talk about apples and oranges. Taxes were cut, but as the
numbers show, tax revenue grew faster than inflation in the
1980s. Spending soared even faster, leading to higher deficits.
<P>
<br>
<a name="pbs">
<P>
<br>
<font size=+2>4) </font> Speaking of Reagan bashing, MRC associate editor Tim
Graham caught some in Tuesday night's PBS Frontline special, The
'96 Choice. Actress Blair Brown, who narrated the show, stated:
"By 1985, Reagan's economics had plunged the country into debt.
Dole's all-out fight to lower the deficit became the defining
battle of his career."
<P>
<br>
<a name="night">
<P>
<br>
<br>
   <font size=+2>5) </font> With several presidential biographers as guests, on
Thursday's (October 10) MSNBC InterNight Bryant Gumbel explored
presidential character. Much of the show was devoted to defending 
Bill Clinton's character. Here are a few of Gumbel's questions:
<blockquote>
    -- Talking about Clinton, Gumbel asked The Washington Post's
David Maraniss: "In the first two years this is a man who tried
his best to balance the budget, to reform health care, to fight
for gay rights, to support personal freedoms. Couldn't those be
considered doing the right things, evidence of true character?"
</blockquote>
<P>
    He tried to balanced the budget?
<P>
  <blockquote>  -- "Do any of those things of which Bill Clinton is charged,
when it comes to character, have much to do with governing
effectively, or with leading?"
</blockquote>
<P>
    Having failed to mention anything about lying and Clinton,
Gumbel moved on to Reagan.
<P>
<blockquote>    -- To Reagan biographer Lou Cannon: "Lou, I know you feel as
if Reagan had few, if any, character flaws. But let me ask you
this. When one sidesteps, or refuses to acknowledge the
consequences of their policies or actions, why shouldn't that be
viewed as a character flaw? Or when one lies. For example, let me
roll a clip and then we'll come back. This one deals with Iran-Contra."
</blockquote>
<P>
<blockquote>
    -- A segment later, he returned to Reagan, asking Cannon if
it was true "that while he appeared to be empathetic, his
policies caused enormous suffering for those who were least able
to afford it?"
</blockquote>
<P>
<br>
<a name="bob">
<P>
<br>
<br>
 <font size=+2>6)</font> Appearing on NBC's Tonight Show Thursday night (October
10), NBC and MSNBC reporter/anchor Brian Williams told Jay Leno
the following anecdote (ALL CAPS = Williams impersonating Bob
Dole yelling):
<blockquote>
   Brian Williams: "I was watching his acceptance speech in San
Diego, which was really the speech of his life, it was a very
dramatic event. And I'm standing there with one of our younger
producers at MSNBC. She's 24 or something and I said 'What do you
think?' She said, 'You know, he scares me.' And I said, 'What do
you mean he scares you?' She said 'It doesn't matter what he's
trying to say, it doesn't matter what the speech says or how well
he's doing it, all I hear him say is GET OFF MY LAWN! I have this
mental image. I'm playing with my friends on the rich guy's lawn
and the guy comes to the door, with his little pen, you know, and
says GET OFF MY LAWN!'" 
</blockquote>
<P>
<br>
<br>
<br>
    Talk about image over substance. And not much sensitivity toward
the disabled. 
<P>

<LI><a href="#bozo">Dole's reaction to a man in a crowd calling Bill Clinton "Bozo"</a> generated media condemnation on Wednesday.

</OL>
<P>
<a name="bozo">
<B>1)</B> On Tuesday a man in a crowd yelled at Dole "Please
get Bozo out of the White House." Dole shot back: "Bozo's on
his way out." But to believe some media reports you'd think
Dole set out Tuesday to launch a new campaign strategy based
upon insulting Clinton. 
<P>
Here's the headline in the Wednesday, October 9 Boston
Globe: <I>"Dole Goes On Attack, Calls Clinton 'Bozo.'"</i> The
subhead: <I>"Comment Draws White House Retort."</I> 
<P>
USA Today's headline declared: <I>"Dole Quips That He'll
Beat 'Bozo.'"</I> The lead of Judy Keen's story: <I>"Bob Dole
politely called his rival 'Mr. President' during Sunday's
presidential debate. But on Tuesday, he referred to him as
'Bozo.'"</I>
<P>
On Wednesday morning's Today Katie Couric talked with
Tim Russert. Here's part of their discussion, as transcribed
by MRC analyst Geoffrey Dickens: 
<BR>
<DD>Couric: "Let me just turn to the presidential campaign
very quickly. As you've heard Tim it turned decidedly
nastier in the Dole camp yesterday. He was talking about a
moral crisis. He refused to answer a question if President
Clinton was morally and ethically capable of being
President. You heard that bozo exchange. Effective strategy
or is this going to come back to haunt him?"
<BR>
<DD>Tim Russert: "I don't think it's an effective strategy.
I was rather surprised. I think Senator Dole was very
effective Sunday night in raising his favorable rating with
the American people. He didn't move many votes but at least
he was looked at in a much more favorable light with his
sense of humor and quickness."
<BR>
<DD>Katie Couric: "But the right wing thought he wasn't
aggressive enough?"
<BR>
<DD>Tim Russert: "Well obviously he's responding to that
criticism and what he's saying is, 'My God, I haven't
reached 40 percent in the polls yet! I have 20 percent of
the Republican party still not voting for me. The only way
to get to them is by being more aggressive and negative on
Clinton.' The problem is Katie when you do that, what you do
is say to a large amount of women, the so-called gender gap,
they don't like that. And they have said repeatedly they
want a more positive campaign. It's a very risky, very risky
venture by Senator Dole."
<P>
<a name="soft">
<B>2)</B> Meanwhile, Al Gore gets a little nicer treatment.
Later on Wednesday, Today aired an interview with the Vice
President caught by MRC analyst Geoffrey Dickens. Here are
all the "questions" posed by Ed Gordon (a frequent host of
MSNBC's InterNight).
<P>
<DD>-- "Many can see that you have indeed been the most
powerful Vice President in our history. You satisfied with
the role that you played for four years?"
<BR>
<DD>-- "The debate is coming up. What do you want people to
come away with, after they watch you and Jack Kemp? What
should they know about Al Gore?"
<BR>
<DD>-- "Biggest difference between you and Jack Kemp?"
<BR>
<DD>-- "You want to be the best second guy you can. You're
there to help the President. Now having said that, do you
want the job in 2000?"
<BR>
<DD>-- "Any concerns that you all are overconfident with the
lead that the polls show and is there any concern that
because the lead is so large you might not be able to use
your coattails to usher in people into the House and the
Senate?"
<P>
Five questions, but Gordon couldn't squeeze in an
inquiry about Al Gore's hypocritical tobacco speech at the
Democratic convention.
<P>
<a name="race">
<B>3)</B> Speaking of sucking up to the VP, ever since a pro-Bush
independent expenditure campaign in 1988 highlighted
the Dukakis furlough of Willie Horton, for the media
Horton symbolized how the GOP "plays the race card."
Conservatives regularly pointed out, to no avail, how Gore
first raised the issue in a 1988 primary debate.
<P>
But in a story for CNN's AllPolitics.com Web site two
CNN reporters on Tuesday cited Gore's question not as an
example of racial politics but as a sign of Gore's
toughness. MRC analyst Steve Kaminski noticed the following
sentence in a VP debate preview story by CNN reporters Marc
Watts and Bob Franken:
<P>
<DD>"Gore can also fire off the tough question. In 1988, as
a Senator, he first raised what became known as the 'Willie
Horton issue' with Michael Dukakis during a primary debate."
<P>
In a February 13, 1992 CNN special on race and the
campaign, MRC associate editor Tim Graham reminded me, Ken
Bode placed all the onus on the GOP: "David Duke's
exploitation of white working class fears about blacks
echoes a theme from the 1988 election. This is the Maryland
State Penitentiary. Inside resides the most politically
notorious convict in America. William Horton, Jr., the focal
point of a major national campaign designed to exploit white
fear of black crime....The Horton case illustrates the
readiness of political leaders to exploit the racial
divide."
<P>
<a name="engberg">
<B>4)</B> Monday's CBS Evening News (October 7) included a
"Reality Check" segment by Eric Engberg on facts asserted
during Sunday's debate. Here's a piece of the story:
<P>
<DD>Eric Engberg: "Some facts got mangled."<BR>
<DD>Dole: "For the first time in history, you pay about 40
percent of what you earn, more than you spend for food,
clothing and shelter combined, for taxes under this
administration."<BR>
<DD>Engberg: "Exaggeration. The most recent government study
says the average household spends $16,000 on the basics, and
only $6,000 on all taxes, including state and local taxes
outside the President's control."<BR>
<P>
As Engberg would say, TIME OUT! On Tuesday the Tax
Foundation released a report showing Dole was correct and
Engberg was wrong. The Tax Foundation discovered that the
government report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics
"greatly understates taxes paid....Among the omissions, the
survey does not list the employee's share of Social Security
tax payments among taxes paid....Similarly, the BLS survey
does not report sales and excise taxes paid....Just as
important, the BLS survey results altogether ignore the
effect of indirect levies, such as business taxes, on
American households."
<P>
Factoring in all these taxes, the Tax Foundation
calculated that for households from $22,500 to $750,000
plus, taxes took a larger bite than the total for food,
clothing, and housing. The Tax Foundation found that
households in the $45,000 to $60,0000 category spent $16,000
as Engberg said on "the basics," but had a $25,000 tax burden.

We need a Reality Check for the CBS Reality Check.

<LI>On Tuesday<a href="#Dole"> Bob Dole</a> responded positively to a supporter in a crowd who yelled "Get the bozo out of the White House." The ABC and NBC evening shows focused on the remark as CNN's Bernard Shaw  wondered "Did Bob Dole lower the level of civility a notch?" 
<LI>Instead of exploring<a href="#FBI"> FBI file revelations and Whitewater,</a> the host of This Morning on CBS complained about how "Whitewater did rear its ugly head" during the debate. 
<LI><a href="#scandal">Clinton scandals</a> may not interest reporters, but Newt Gingrich had to answer six questions in a row about his ethics situation. On NBC's Today Matt Lauer asked whether he's "been completely forthright and truthful in providing information" to the House ethics committee and if he'll be forced to resign. 
<LI>Katie Couric asked<a href="#liddy"> Elizabeth Dole</a> whether Bob Dole is paying the price for a Republican Congress which was "simply too harsh or too draconian."

<a name="Dole">
<FONT SIZE=+2>1</FONT>) On Tuesday night (October 8) ABC's World News Tonight
and NBC Nightly News aired stories on the big spending by labor
unions to defeat freshmen Republicans. The CBS Evening News and
ABC's World News Tonight featured pieces with clips of their
correspondent interviewing Bob Dole on his bus.
<BR>
<DD>
The big news of the day: Bozo. A man in a crowd yelled at
Dole that he should get bozo out of the White House. Dole shot
back: "Bozo's on his way out."
<P>
CNN's Bernard Shaw opened Inside Politics: "Was he borrowing
the words of an over-enthusiastic supporter, or did Bob Dole
lower the level of civility a notch in his contest with Bill
Clinton?"
<P>
On World News Tonight, ABC's John Cochran began his piece:
"Under pressure from critics in his own party to get personal
with the President, today Dole said he's ready to do just that.
In a series of interviews Dole admitted he was too soft on the
President in their first debate, especially on White House access
to FBI files on well-known Republicans...."
<P>
Noting that Dole failed to demand that Clinton promise not
the pardon those involved in Whitewater, Cochran ran a clip of
Dole explaining: "It would seem to me, particularly in the first
debate, when there's this myth out there about the mean Bob Dole,
if I'd done anything that even appeared to be stepping over the
line, that would have been the story."
<P>
Cochran continued: "That was exactly what happened today when
a supporter asked Dole to please get the bozo out of the White
House. Dole said bozo's on his way out."
<P>
Of course, Cochran made it the story. He didn't have to. The
CBS Evening News didn't mention the exchange.
<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<a name="FBI">
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>2</FONT>) Cochran didn't use Dole's admission that he went too
easy on Clinton on the FBI files as an opportunity to report how
an aide to Craig Livingstone had contradicted his story. But he's
not the only reporter with an aversion to Clinton scandals. On
Monday's This Morning (October 7) Mark McEwen discussed the
debate with Bob Beckel and Fred Barnes. McEwen told Barnes:
"Senator Dole said he wasn't going to mention Whitewater, then
Whitewater did rear its ugly head last night."
<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<a name="scandal">
<P>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>3</FONT>) NBC's Today has also failed to report anything on the
deposition from Craig Livingstone's aide (see October 6
CyberAlert for details). But, on Tuesday morning Today's Matt
Lauer repeatedly pressed Newt Gingrich about his ethics case. 
<BR>
<DD>
Lauer asked Gingrich seven questions about the debate and why
he's so unpopular, then fired six questions about Gingrich and
the ethics committee. Here are the last six question posed by
Lauer in his October 8 interview with Gingrich:

<blockquote> "Are you completely sure, Mr. Speaker, that you have been
completely forthright and truthful in providing information to
this committee?"<BR>
<DD>"But wouldn't it seem somewhat obvious that there must be
something that's disturbing or distressing them completely. Why
would Republicans, on the subcommittee, vote to expand the
investigation if they haven't found something that disturbs even
them?"<BR>
<DD>"But can you think of a logical reason why they would do
that?"<BR>
<DD>"Do you envision any circumstances, Mr. Speaker, under
which you might be forced to resign based on this investigation?"<BR>
<DD>"So if the ethics committee comes back and says Newt
Gingrich was not truthful with us in supplying information?"<BR>
<DD>Gingrich: "I don't think they can say that."<BR>
<DD> "If they did, would you consider resigning?"<BR>
<P>
<BR>
</blockquote>
<a name="liddy">
<P>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>4)</FONT> In the next hour on Tuesday's Today, Katie Couric talked
with Elizabeth Dole. One of Couric's questions:
<blockquote>
"I know that was a major goal of the Dole campaign [in
debate], to make sure people saw this compassionate side of Bob
Dole. Do you think that he is in some ways paying the price for a
Republican Congress that enacted, or tried to enact measures, in
the views of many were simply too harsh or too draconian?" 

</blockquote>
<P>
<BR>
Maybe he's just paying the price for a biased media.

<Li> On Thursday the <a href="#nasty">Dole and Clinton</a> campaigns released new TV
ads. Guess which one NBC's Brian Williams labeled "nasty." 
<LI>In front of cameras in the Senate press conference facility on
Friday, Senator <a href="#orrin">Orrin Hatch </a> released the deposition of a former
aide to Craig Livingstone. She said the FBI files were not
obtained by mistake and that there are pages missing from the log
tracking who looked at the files. Network coverage: Zilch.
<LI> The Wall Street Journal's <a href="#al">Al Hunt</a> spews some mean-spirited
venom, tagging a former Republican presidential candidate a
"hatemonger" (and it's not Pat Buchanan), calls one current U.S. 
Senate candidate an "extremist" while saying another symbolizes 
"hate." Special bonus: he trashes Kenneth Starr.

On Friday night's (October 4) CBS Evening News, reporter
Phil Jones explained what Dole has to do in the debate: "He's got
to explain how his campaign centerpiece, the 15 percent tax cut,
can be paid for without draconian cuts in social programs. He
wants to talk about the character issue, but he can't get
personal or look mean-spirited doing it."
<P>
    Avoiding a media tag of being mean-spirited will be pretty
tough. Just look at Thursday night's (October 3) The News with
Brian Williams on MSNBC.
 <P>   Williams announced: "We're going to take a look at the new
political ads that are out tonight. There are two of them. We're
going to begin with the latest ad from the Dole campaign which
takes the campaign into a bit of nasty territory. Here it is now
in its entirety."
<P>
<DD>    And here's the "nasty" ad:
<P>
<blockquote>Dole ad narrator: "How to speak liberal."<BR>
Clinton video: "I can tell you this. I will not raise taxes on
the middle class to pay for these programs."<BR>
Narrator: "That's liberal for I raised taxes right on the middle
class. How to speak more liberal."<BR>
Clinton: "People in this room still mad at me for that budget<BR>
because you think I raised your taxes too much."<BR>
Narrator: "That's liberal for I raised taxes even on Social
Security."<BR>
Clinton: "It might surprise you to know that I think I raised
them too much too."<BR>
Narrator: "That's liberal for I raised your taxes and got
caught."<BR>
</blockquote>
<P>
    Disjointed maybe, but nasty? Williams continued: "President 
Clinton is firing back with a new ad touting his achievements in 
office and once again tying Bob Dole to House Speaker Newt Gingrich."
<P>
    MSNBC showed the non-nasty ad which is all in color, except
for the video of Dole and Gingrich which is in black and white:
<P>
<blockquote>
Clinton ad narrator over video of scenes matching the text:
"Imagine. It's 11pm and you know where your kids are. At home.
President Clinton supports curfews so children are home and safe.
School uniforms to instill discipline. Ban cigarette ads aimed at
our children. Require teenage mothers to stay in school or lose
welfare.
<P> 
[black and white video of Dole next to Gingrich]: Dole and
Gingrich tried to slash school anti-drug programs. They'd take us
back.
<P>
[video in color of Clinton strolling under trees]: President
Clinton is looking forward. Helping parents to teach children
responsibility, protecting our values."

The front page headline in the Saturday, October 5
Washington Times declared: "Livingstone Lied on 'Filegate,' Ex-Aide 
Implies." The Washington Post also made the news its lead
story: "White House Contradicted on FBI Files: Ex-Aide Tells
Panel Staff Knew of Checks on GOP Officials." The Los Angeles
Times ran a story inside, but Saturday's New York Times had not a
word.
<P>
    Having watched all three broadcast network evening shows
Friday night, this was news to me. ABC's World News Tonight, CBS
Evening News and the NBC Nightly News did not mention the
development.(CNN's The World Today co-anchor Linden Soles did do a
brief item on it with a soundbite from Hatch.) What did TV
viewers miss?
<P>    
Here's the opening of Post reporter George Lardner's story:
<blockquote>"A former executive assistant in the White House security office,
contradicting accounts by her old boss and co-workers, told
Senate investigators this week that 'everybody in the office
knew' in the fall of 1993 that they were obtaining FBI files on
'people who were no longer working there.'
"The aide, Mari Anderson, an ex-Clinton-Gore campaign worker,
said they even joked about some prominent Republicans still listed
as current White House pass holders."</blockquote>
 <P>
   Later in the story:
<P>
<blockquote>"Asked about a six-month gap in the security office log
maintained to show who checked out files, Anderson said she was
confident some pages were missing from the copy the White House
provided the committee. She said she distinctly remembered making
checkout notations in the loose-leaf log during that six month
period, from March 29, 1994, to September 21, 1994."
</blockquote>
<P>
    Nixon only "accidently erased" 18 minutes. 
<P>
   So, did the front page treatment in both of Washington's
newspapers prompt network interest? No. NBC's Today on Saturday
didn't mention the news, but did find time to report that the
maker of M&Ms is test marketing 18 new colors. Saturday night,
ABC and CBS evening shows were bumped by college football in DC,
but NBC Nightly News aired nothing.  
<P>
    Minutes later on CNN's Capital Gang National Review's Kate
O'Beirne made the revelations her Outrage of the Week, observing:
"It remains to be seen if this prompts the outrage from the
people in the press is so richly deserves."
<P>
    Not so far. Sunday morning Sam Donaldson at least did ask
This Week with David Brinkley guest Leon Panetta a question about
it.
<P>
<BR>
    UPDATE 1: Last week I reported that none of the broadcast
networks reported the September 25 revelation of the six month
gap in the log. MRC analyst Geoffrey Dickens has let me know that
CNN's The World Today (10pm ET) did air a whole piece that night
by Bob Franken.
<P>
    UPDATE 2: Last week I also reported that the networks failed
to note the FDIC report on how Hillary Clinton had deceived them.
Well, Friday night, a week and a half after the report made The
Washington Post's front page, it made NBC Nightly News, but only
through the hook of a chance to disparage Kenneth Starr for
speaking Friday at Regent University. 
 <P>
   NBC's Jim Miklaszewski reported: "Whitewater prosecutor
Kenneth Starr was invited to appear by outspoken Clinton critic
Pat Robertson and the audience was very conservative. The White
House claims that's proof Starr is out to get Clinton for
political reasons, but Starr says he'll stay the course."
<P>
    Miklaszewski went on to summarize the status of Starr's
inquiry into the First Lady. Miklaszewski described the
FDIC report and aired the White House rebuttal.
<P>
<BR>

<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>3)</FONT>
 On Saturday's Capital Gang (October 5) on CNN, Al Hunt,
Wall Street Journal Executive Washington Editor, was full of
hate. 
<P>
<blockquote>    -- "I think North Carolina is a test in the great divide in
the Republican conservative movement. There's the politics of
hope personified by Jack Kemp and there's the politics of hate
personified by Jesse Helms."<P>
    -- On Louisiana where Democrat Landrieu faces Republican
Jenkins: "In Louisiana, I think, Mary Landrieu is a bad
candidate, but she's going to win for three reasons. Woody
Jenkins is an extremist, Bill Clinton's going to carry Louisiana
and Newt Gingrich has scared those African-Americans. There'll be
a big black turnout."<P>
    -- His Outrage of the Week: "Kenneth Starr, the supposedly
non-partisan independent counsel investigating the Clintons, was
the featured speaker yesterday at a luncheon sponsored by right
wing hatemonger Pat Robertson, *whose Christian Broadcasting
Network and Regent Law School*. By pandering to Clinton-haters,
Mr. Starr appears to be abandoning all pretenses of impartiality.
He went into this job with a reputation as a fair-minded
conservative. He now looks more like a political hit man
desperately eager for a future Supreme Court appointment." 
    [* There is a word missing, but that's what he said.]

ABC <I>World News Tonight</I> anchor Forest Sawyer announced<BR>
Thursday night (October 3): 
<P>    "For days President Clinton has been dominating the news with
his efforts to ease the crisis between Israel and the
Palestinians. Today, Bob Dole decided to step onto center stage
with a harshly worded attack not only on the administration's
work in the Middle East, but its entire foreign policy. Senator
Dole called the past three years rudderless and illusionary. He
claimed the President has squandered American power. The
administration has so far answered softly, but says there is more
to come."
<P>
    Reporter John Cochran went on the tag the speech as
"scathing." He reported: "In a scathing critique of Clinton
foreign policy, Dole rolled off a long list of what he called
failures, going back to the 1993 effort to restore order in
Somalia."
<P>
    What was the administration's response that earned Sawyer's
"soft" description? CBS and NBC viewers heard Press Secretary
Mike McCurry's retort. He played off Spiro Agnew's "nattering
nabobs of negativism" line (not generally considered "soft") and
asserted that Dole foreign policy advisers are "nattering
naysayers of gloom." ABC didn't show viewers McCurry's soundbite.
<P>
    On NBC Nightly News, David Bloom also used the term "harsh"
to describe Dole's speech: "It was Dole's harshest critique yet
of what he called Clinton's failed foreign policy." But a bit
later in his story Bloom put the tone in a better light, noting
that "After reviewing his speech over breakfast with retired
General Colin Powell, Dole chose his words carefully. His tone
was measured. He was playing politics, but he wanted to appear
presidential."
<P>
<BR>
<a name="gore">
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>2)</FONT>
CBS reporter Rita Braver profiled Al Gore Thursday
night. Her October 3 Evening News piece included this rather
bizarre sequence: 
<blockquote>Braver: "He's in on every key White House meeting and
decision. Just last month in his role as environmental guru, Gore
convinced the President to create a controversial national
monument in Utah. Of late, Republican have attacked him for making
a convention speech about his sister's death from lung cancer
caused by smoking."<BR>
Gore at Democratic convention: "It hurt very badly to watch her
savaged by that terrible disease."<BR>
Braver: "While for several years after her death he let tobacco
be grown on land he owned. Gore dismisses that attack as
politics, an attempt to sully a man so close to the President he
feels free to interrupt him."<BR>
Gore, going to microphone in front of Clinton: "Could I add a
word since..."<BR>
Braver: "But above all Gore sees his job as making the President
look good. And he's been amply rewarded. It's no secret that if
Bill Clinton is re-elected he wants Al Gore to succeed him."
</blockquote>
<P>
    So, CBS acknowledges the whole premise of Gore's emotional
convention speech was a fraud, but it's wrong to even raise the
subject because he's so powerful he can cut in front of the
President at a podium.

"Pollsters, pundits, look at these numbers and they'll say this

doesn't he just accept it and be himself? Try to hold the
Republican Congress and get rid of this book, and get rid of
these crazy 15 percent tax cuts and speak from the heart?" <DD> -- NBC
Washington Bureau Chief Tim Russert to Dole campaign manager
Scott Reed on CNBC's <I>Tim Russert</I>, September 22.
<P>
"Americans are forever grumbling about high taxes and big
government. You'd think promising a tax cut would be like giving
away free candy. What's not to like? Everybody knows what happens
when you eat too much candy. You get cavities. You get sick. You
get fat. A big tax cut may feel good but it can cause
problems...`Candy?' Dole says. `No thank you,' the voters reply.
`We're feeling much better now and we don't want to get sick
again.' Dr. Dole and Dr. Kemp are supply-side specialists. They
have a revolutionary theory that says `Candy is good for you!
More tax cuts, more growth. More growth, more income.' Now what a
terrific theory! And so what if Democratic doctors say they are a
couple of quacks. Gene [Randall], have some candy!"

Elizabeth Dole? It hasn't happened, and yet you see the
Republicans attacking Hillary Rodham Clinton, who I agree has
made mistakes, but they [Republicans] have no boundaries, and I
think that yes, both parties are guilty of using smear tactics --
it goes back to as I said the origin of American politics -- but
I think the Republicans are quite frankly, better at it than the
Democrats, and I think most people see that and believe
that....Why don't you recognize some of the hypocrisy on the part
of the Republicans?....Well, for starters, a rape victim up on

<LI><a href="#gumbel">Bryant Gumbel</a> wonders if OJ Simpson "will ever get a fair shake in this country?" It's one of several liberal questions on race he poses to Johnnie Cochran.
<LI><a href="#moderate">The newly moderate</a> President Clinton attends a fundraiser packed with aging 1960s lefties and Hollywood celebrities with animus toward Republicans. 
<LI><a href="#faithful">Incredibly, a major newspaper</a> says it was an error to report that Bill Clinton and Dick Morris have been unfaithful to their wives.
</OL>
<P>
<a name="gumbel">
<B>1) Wednesday's Today (October 2)</B> carried the third part of
Bryant Gumbel's interview with Johnnie Cochran. And as he did on
Monday, Gumbel again used the segment as an opportunity to
promote his liberal views on race.
<P>
<DD>Discussing how much media attention the first OJ trial
attracted, Bryant Gumbel asked: "Do you think if those two
victims had been, say, Marguerite, his first wife, and Al
Cowlings, his best friend, that there would have been the same
amount?"
<P>
<DD>Johnnie Cochran responded: "Absolutely not. And I think any
person who wants to be honest about it would say the same thing."<BR>
<DD>To which Gumbel shot back: "Why? Because America doesn't care
about black victims?"
<P>
<DD>After Cochran's reply, Gumbel inquired: "Most white Americans
still charge that OJ's jurors didn't do their job. You talk about
a rush to judgment. They would claim the same. They would claim
the verdict was race based. Do you think their judgment of those
jurors is race based?"
<P>
<DD>Then, after asking if the complicated case merited more
consideration that jury gave it in a few hour of deliberation, 
Gumbel wondered: "Do you think OJ will ever get a fair shake in
this country. Will people ever let him live out his life and
accept the fact that he was acquitted?"
<P>
<DD>Fair shake? He's a millionaire football player who
successfully led a second career as a sports commentator, actor
and commercial spokesman. He then murders two people but is found
not guilty. How unfair.
<P>
<a name="moderate">
<B>2) At Boston's Fleet Center Saturday night</B> the Democrats
and Senator John Kerry held a $2 million fundraiser starring
several celebrities.  
<P>
<DD>During the Democratic convention, NBC's Tom Brokaw insisted
that since 1992 Clinton and Gore "have slid across the political
spectrum to really right of center." Keeping that assurance in
mind, here's a bit of Boston Globe reporter Michael Grunwald's
September 29 story on the event: "Peter, Paul and Mary played
'Blowin in the Wind,' even though President Clinton has been
accused of doing just that. In fact, the legendary folk trio even
played 'Puff the Magic Dragon' -- and the President clapped along,
war on drugs notwithstanding....It was a long, strange trip at
the Fleet Center last night, as a parade of lefty rockers and
folkies brought back a slice of 1960s culture for a 1990s audience." 
<P>
<DD>These 1960s activists were in attendance to praise the
President. The Washington Post reported on September 30: "Mary
Travers said peace, justice and equality are still what the fight
is all about, while [Don] Henley praised the President for
protecting the environment and exhorted the audience to elect a
Democratic Congress 'so that there will be trees to hug,'"
<P>
<DD>Current stars also attended as the Boston Herald's Ed Hayward
reported that comedienne/actress Whoopi Goldberg announced: "I'm
glad to see some good-looking people in office. The other party
seems to have taken some ugly pills."
<P>
<DD>Isn't that the kind of language the media deem "nasty" when
uttered by a conservative?
<P>
<a name="faithful">
<B>3) The Internet Guild's Steve Allen caught this gem</B> while
doing a Nexis search. Under the "corrections and clarifications"
heading the September 5 Chicago Tribune corrected syndicated
columnist Linda Bowles: 
<P>
<DD>"In her Wednesday Commentary page column, Linda Bowles stated
that President Clinton and his former campaign adviser Dick
Morris both were 'guilty of callous unfaithfulness to their wives
and children.' Neither man has admitted to being or been proven to
have been unfaithful. The Tribune regrets the error." 
<P>
<DD>So, this is an "error" but reporting "slashes" in Medicare or
school lunches is just solid reporting.

<LI><a href="#20/20"> To Hugh Downs on 20/20</a> Friday night, it's Hillary the world's most persecuted First Lady. And Barbara Walters comes at Bill Clinton from the left, charging the welfare bill was "too extreme."
<LI><a href="#headlines">You can't always trust what you read.</a> A local example of conflicting headlines based on the same facts. 
<LI><a href="#text">The text of the September 23</a> edition of Notable Quotables. Most of the quotes have not been in any CyberAlert messages. Among the quotes, the New York Times says the Republican Party has been "a vehicle of white supremacy in the South, beginning with the Goldwater campaign..." Plus, Time and Newsweek slobber over Al Gore.
</OL>
<a name="20/20">
<B>1) On Friday night (September 20) ABC's 20/20</B><BR> ran Barbara
Walters' interview with the Clintons. Introducing the second segment,
co-host Hugh Downs announced: 
<P>
<DD>    "She is, perhaps, the most criticized, the most scrutinized,
First Lady in history. Everyone has an opinion about Hillary Clinton,
and Mrs. Clinton has heard them all. How has her marriage changed in
these four years? What are her concerns now, both personal and political?
Barbara continues now with the President and the First Lady, the world's
most powerful couple."
<P>
<DD>    During that segment, Bill Clinton said he might have Hillary
work on welfare reform during his second term, a suggestion that he
may scale back welfare reform to please liberals. But instead of pursuing 
the possibility that his signature was nothing more than election-year
positioning, in the next segment Walters asked him:
<P>
<DD>"Even your own aides, many of them, and advisers feel that the bill 
is too extreme. Two of your advisers recently quit. Under the new bill a
60 year old federal guarantee of aid to needy families will end. It's
been estimated as many as a million children will go hungry. What are
you going to do about that?"
<P>
<a name="headlines">
<B>2) In the Virginia Senate race,</B><BR> incumbent Republican John
 Warner faces Democratic challenger Mark Warner. Having both
candidates share a last name isn't the only confusing part about
following the race. Just look at these two headlines from
September 19 on a Mason-Dixon poll showing the Republican Warner
leading 54 to 34 percent.

<B>Mistake to Talk to Conservatives; Mistake Not to Talk to Liberals</B><BR>
"Dole decided only this morning to speak to the Christian
Coalition despite worries inside his campaign that a bow to the
religious right might send the wrong message to moderate, swing
voters....Clinton's campaign spokesman said in a statement:
`Watching Bob Dole arm in arm with Pat Robertson speaks volumes
to the extreme agenda being pursued by the Dole-Kemp-Gingrich
team.' Bob Dole tried, perhaps even succeeded today, in
reinvigorating his Republican base. But a top Clinton campaign
official was all smiles, saying, `if you see Dole, tell him
thanks for me.'"<BR>
<DD><I>-- NBC's David Bloom, September 14 Nightly News.</I>
<P>
<CENTER><I>vs.</I></CENTER>
<P>
"No doubt this was a Clinton crowd [at the NAACP convention].
That comes as no surprise to Bob Dole. Dole had been invited to
speak at the convention yesterday, but declined. He claimed he
was already committed to campaigning and the All-Star baseball
game. To those at this convention that was quite a stretch and
an insult to African-American voters....By not showing up here,
Bob Dole may reinforce those racial divides along party lines
and fuel the anxiety among some Republicans that in this
presidential campaign, Bob Dole may not be up to the challenge."<BR>
<DD><I>-- NBC's Jim Miklaszewski, July 10 Nightly News. </I>
<P>
<B>Fallows' Hillary Fan Club Application</B><BR>
"Is Hillary Clinton's predicament worse because she is a woman?
Probably so. From Primary Colors to Rush Limbaugh to Saturday
Night Live, the hostile stereotype of Hillary is the domineering
ice-woman, the one person who scares the Most Powerful Man in
the World. Bill Clinton has suffered when judged on the age-old
standard of masculinity: military service. But female observers,
from Camille Paglia to Maureen Dowd, have judged Hillary with a
catty ferocity they would not apply to men. A man with a prim
exterior can get into trouble, too, as Jimmy Carter could
testify, but he mainly risks being seen as a weakling. Such a
woman is an emasculating schemer." <BR>
<DD><I>-- New U.S. News & World
Report Editor James Fallows in an essay titled "She's Lois Lane"
in the September/October Mirabella magazine.</I>
<P>
<B>Ad Says Dole Opposes Time Off While Your Kid Dies: I Loved It!</B><BR>
"That family leave ad was right on the mark. You know, it
absolutely escapes me how somebody can be for family values and
yet be willing to deny a father the opportunity to spend time
with a critically ill child or a mother time with a newborn
without fear of losing their job." <BR><DD><I>-- Wall Street Journal Executive Washington Editor Al Hunt on the Clinton campaign's negative ads, CNN's Capital Gang, September 14.</I>
<P>
<B>Intensely Competitive Puff Pieces About Gore</B><BR>
"George Bush fumed about jokes that he had put his manhood in a
blind trust to serve as Ronald Reagan's Vice President. The
young Dan Quayle never convinced the country he had the gravitas
to be Veep, let alone top man. But the cerebral, private,
intensely competitive Al Gore has managed the contortionist's
feat of projecting an almost perfect loyalty to his boss's
re-election without diminishing himself...Gore and Clinton, both
brainy, moderate Southerners with an abiding interest in the
plumbing of government, speak an easy shorthand and razz each
other like competitive brothers." <BR>
<DD><I>-- Time Washington reporter J.F.O. McAllister, September 2.</I>
<P>
"Though Al Gore relishes politics almost as much as his boss
does, tonight he is next door in the Old Executive Office
Building, doing what he really loves: thinking about complexity
theory, open systems, Goethe and the absence of scientific
metaphors in modern society. He's writing a speech, and the
elegant Ceremonial Office is strewn with pizza cartons and Diet
Coke cans...Clinton may lead the country into the millennium,
but it is Gore who truly embodies the new century's
possibilities and anxieties."<BR>
<DD><I> -- Newsweek reporter Bill Turque, September 2.</I>
<P>
<B>As Opposed to Those Pro-Civil Rights Southern Democrats</B><BR>
"But most important is the Republican Party's recent record as
the vehicle of white supremacy in the South, beginning with the
Goldwater campaign and reaching its apex in Richard M. Nixon's
`Southern Strategy' in 1968 and 1972. Republicans appealed to
Nixon Democrats (later Reagan Democrats) in the northern
suburbs, many of them ethnic voters who had left the cities to
escape from blacks, with promises to crack down on welfare
cheats and to impose law and order, and they fought against
affirmative action." <BR>
<DD><I>-- New York Times Washington Bureau Chief
R.W. Apple on why the Dole-Kemp ticket isn't attracting black
support, September 19.</I>
<P>
<B>Clinton Makes Life Great, Dole Makes It Worse</B><BR>
"For most people in this country, life is awfully good. So
Clinton doesn't need to raise any issues. He just needs to point
to his record and promise more of the same. The people who don't
have a great life right now -- the 39 million people below the
poverty level, the 40 million people with no health insurance,
the 6.2 million people earning at or below the minimum wage --
are the people who really do have the issues. But Dole isn't
about to reach out to them, and they aren't about to vote for
Dole or the Republicans. That would make their plight worse, if
that's possible."<BR><DD><I> -- Former NBC News President Michael Gartner
in his USA Today column, September 17.</I>
<P>
<B>So What If the Tax Burden's At A Historic High?</B><BR>
"But if the economy's booming, as you say it is, why do we need
tax cuts at all?"<BR>
<DD><I>-- Time Washington reporter Michael Duffy to
Alan Murray on PBS's Washington Week in Review, September 6.</I>
<P>
<B>The Media Encouraged Newt's Extremism</B><BR>
"The media's preoccupation with conflict in general deeply
affects the behavior of politicians, especially in Congress. An
ambitious politician knows that the sure way to command press
attention is with sensationalism and extremist polemics. Newt
Gingrich built his power with media fireworks." <BR>
<DD><I>-- Former New York Times reporter Hedrick Smith narrating his PBS special
People and the Power Game, September 3.</I>
<P>
<B>Bigoted Bonnie</B><BR>
"TV viewers saw a well-orchestrated image of a moderated
Republican Party, portraying itself as pro-woman,
pro-minorities, and pro-tolerance. This is in sharp contrast to
the delegates on the floor, sixty percent of whom
self-identified as conservative Christians." <BR>

<a name="networks">
<FONT  SIZE=+2>1) Last week</FONT> I reported that the network evening shows had
failed to mention a FDIC report which concluded that Hillary
Clinton had drafted a real estate document meant to "deceive"
federal regulators. The FDIC report was released last Monday,
September 23. Through Monday night September 30 it had yet to
generate a mention on any of the broadcast networks.
<P>
<I>What else went unreported on network evening shows last week:</I>
-- On Tuesday, September 24 a House committee held hearing on
how the Clinton Administration let criminals become citizens. The
Washington Times story the next day began: "Immigration workers
yesterday told a House Government Reform and Oversight
subcommittee of  rampant' abuses in the Citizenship USA program
that apparently let thousands of immigrants with criminal records
become citizens."
<I>Network evening show coverage: Still waiting.</I>
<P>
-- On Wednesday, September 25. Senator Orrin Hatch revealed a
six month gap in the log listing who at the White House accessed
the FBI background files. The Washington Times bannered the news
across page one the next day.
<I>Network evening show coverage: Still waiting.</I>
<P>
-- also on Wednesday, The Washington Times reported that U.S.
Rep. John Mica had sent a letter to Clinton's drug czar demanding
release of a four month old Institute for Defense Analysis report
that concluded Bush's interdiction policy was far more effective
than Clinton's drug treatment emphasis. Just 9 percent of
Clinton's drug budget goes to interdiction.
<I>Network evening show coverage: Still waiting, but drug czar Barry McCaffrey is scheduled to respond at an October 1 House hearing.</I>
<P>
-- On Thursday, September 26, 170 members of Congress send a
letter to Clinton asking that he promise not to pardon any
Whitewater figures. In an interview last Monday on the PBS
NewsHour Clinton had said he thought Kenneth Starr was out to get
him and the President defended Susan McDougal's decision to
refuse to testify. The Sunday Washington Times had a story which
began: "House Democrats were prepared to shut down the government
if Republican demanded a vote on a resolution calling for
President Clinton not to pardon key Whitewater figures, Rep.
Spencer Bachus said yesterday."
<I>Network evening show coverage: One question from anchor John Roberts to analyst Laura Ingraham on the Sept. 29 CBS Evening News.</I>
<P>
What did they cover? Between last Thursday and Sunday each of
the network evening shows aired two stories on Newt Gingrich's
dealings with the House ethics committee. And on Sunday's Today,
co-host Jodie Applegate couldn't quite get her history correct,
asking Gingrich Press Secretary Tony Blankley:

<FONT  SIZE=+2>5) On Monday's (Sept. 30) Today,</FONT> Bryant Gumbel began day
one of a three day series with Johnnie Cochran. While Gumbel did
ask about OJ's alibi and how even if the Los Angeles police
botched the investigation and employ racist, that it's hard to
believe a conspiracy, he also posed these two questions:
    "Comments that he has made to others would seem to indicate a
certain degree of, and not unjustifiably, a certain degree of
anger, bitterness. Has he expressed that to you?"
    "Why do you suppose it is that one year after his acquittal,

<P> 
<OL>
<LI><a href="#abc">ABC's World News Tonight</a>, which didn't report poverty and
income statistics when they were bad, highlighted them Thursday
night when they helped Clinton. And their one expert credited
the President.
<LI><a href="#what">What's wrong with liberalism,</a> CNN's Bernard Shaw asks plaintively.   
</OL>
<a name="abc">
<FONT  SIZE=+2>1) Bad news is news, not good news. Right?</FONT> Not at ABC when
the good news benefits Clinton.
<P>
    On October 6, 1994 the Census Bureau reported poverty had
risen to a three-decade high. ABC's World News Tonight: No story.
On October 5, 1995 the bureau reported a slight drop in poverty,
but the gap between richest and poorest grew. ABC's World News
Tonight: No story.
<P>
    On September 26, 1996 the Census bureau reports median income
up and poverty down. ABC's World News Tonight: Big story
crediting Bill Clinton.
<P>
    Peter Jennings opened the show Thursday night: "On World News
Tonight this Thursday, a bloody day between Israelis and
Palestinians. The Census Bureau says that Americans are earning
more for the first time in six years. Family income is up."
<P>
    Barry Serafin reported in his story that median household
income was up 2.7 percent, but still lower than 1989. Serafin's
story continued:
<BR><DD>"The number of Americans living in poverty fell. There were 36.4
million people below the poverty level, 1.6 million fewer than
the year before. The poverty rate for African-Americans dropped
to its lowest level since 1959, 29.3 percent. What does it add up
to?"
<BR><DD>Professor Frank Levy, MIT: "Things are slowly getting better and
the people feel OK about it. It's not nirvana, but it's certainly
not doom and gloom either."
<BR><DD>Serafin: "And there was certainly no gloom and doom at the White
House where the President pounced on the new figures."
Clinton: "The news is remarkably good, and I'd like to share it
with you."
<BR><DD>Serafin: "Citing the income gains the President declared that the
country is on the right track. He heralded progress on narrowing
the gap between the richest and poorest Americans"
<BR><DD>Clinton: "We have had the largest decline in the inequality of
incomes in America in 27 years."
<BR><DD>Serafin: "Census Bureau officials, however, said that decline was
so small it was statistically insignificant. Still, there was
praise for today's generally upbeat report."
<BR><DD>Levy: "Well I think the credit is shared between the President
and Alan Greenspan at the Federal Reserve."
<BR><DD>Serafin: "All in all the new numbers added to a very good day for
Bill Clinton."
<P>
<DD>The New York Times reported June 30 that "the share of
national income earned by the top 5 percent of households grew at
a faster rate than during the eight years of the Reagan
administration, which was often characterized as favoring the
rich." ABC's World News Tonight that night: No story.
<P>
<DD>Immediately following Serafain, Jim Wooten reported on Bob
Dole in Florida. Wooten noted that Dole correctly pointed out
that poverty rose in Florida, then reported: "Still, the Senator
had much less to say about the numbers than about a President he
says is lying to older Americans, telling them Republicans will
cut Medicare, trying to frighten them into voting Democratic."
<BR><DD>Following a Dole soundbite, Wooten continued: "Then Senator
Dole tried to raise a bit of fear himself about Mr. Clinton's
plans for a second term."
<BR><DD>Dole: "He'll raise taxes again on the America people if he's re-elected."
Wooten: "The Senator insists that his principle campaign themes -- his 
bad news message about a limping economy, stagnate wages, high taxes 
and heavy deficits -- will eventually change the shape of this election. 
So far they haven't, but he keeps trying."
<P>
<DD>They might have a better chance if ABC weren't endorsing Clinton's 
claims while countering Dole's by saying he's also employing fear. 
<P>
<a name="what">
<FONT  SIZE=+2>2) On the September 25 Inside Politics</FONT> CNN's Bernie Shaw
took up the Dole charge that Clinton is really a liberal. To put
Shaw's question in context, here's how the exchange went with
Republican strategist Charlie Black and Democratic strategist
Frank Greer:
<BR><DD>Charlie Black: "People don't mind name calling if you call them
conservatives, which is what Bob Dole is. Teenage drug use has
doubled because Bill Clinton reduced the size of the White House
drug office 83 percent. How can you say he's had a good record on
drugs? Bernie, here's the problem. Bill Clinton wants the federal
government to run your life. He wants to take more and more of
your hard-earned money and then he wants to reward you a tax
credit if you behave the way he wants you to behave."
<BR><DD>Frank Greer: "It's the same worn-out rhetoric that they tried to
use in Congress and it didn't work."
<BR><DD>Bernard Shaw: "I understand the desire to talk about issues. I
understand that. A very innocent question. What's wrong with
being a liberal?"

<LI> ABC's Jim Wooten uses some <a href="#extremist">extremist</a> labeling to describe the
Arizona electorate.
<LI>The Weekly Standard discovers that President Clinton hired his
<a href="#speech">speechwriter </a> from U.S. News & World Report because Clinton liked
how the journalist covered his 1992 campaign. That reporter now 
calls Clinton "the moral leader of the Universe."
<LI> A <a href="#study">study</a> determines that during the conventions network reporters

<H3> 1)</H3> On Tuesday night's (September 17) World News Tonight, ABC's
Jim Wooten reported from Arizona on Bob Dole's campaign. Wooten 
asserted:<P>

<DD>"It's one measure of Senator Dole's problems that he even feels it 
<DD>necessary to campaign here in Arizona, Barry Goldwater's ultra-
<DD>conservative backyard. But the race is close here, quite close."
<P>
    Not "usually safe for Republicans," but "ultra-conservative." How
"ultra-conservative" exactly is Senator McCain? And if the state is so
"ultra-conservative" how could it possibly go for Clinton?

<H3>2)</H3> The September 23 Weekly Standard includes a profile of chief
White House speechwriter Donald Baer who had been Assistant Managing
Editor of U.S. News & World Report when he jumped to the Clinton team
in 1994. Writer Christopher Caldwell explained how Baer got his job:
<DD>    "Clinton liked the articles Baer contributed to U.S. News during
the 1992 campaign. While other journalists -- David Shribman of The
Wall Street Journal, Joe Klein of New York, Ron Brownstein of the Los
Angeles Times -- ignored the more sensational aspects of the campaign
for enthusiastic grapplings with 'Clintonism,' Baer wrote with extreme
empathy about Clinton's background.
 <DD>   "'I think it's a southern thing' says one of Baer's journalistic
colleagues, who also knows Clinton. 'Being of the South and still being
rooted there, yet being driven and ambitious enough to prove oneself
in the larger world -- the two of them have a lot in common.' While
Baer has always been a loyal Democrat, he's not necessarily a liberal.
Like Clinton, he has an idiosyncratic, instinctive, generally 
progressive politics that winds up at beyond-left-and-rightism. This 
enthusiasm can appear like ideological non-commitment or caginess. 
One New Democrat who met Baer at a dinner last year described him as 
'bland beyond description, a fount of cliches. 'Clinton was the moral 
leader of the Universe,' and all that.'"
<P>

<BR><a name="study"> </a>
<H3>    3) </H3>Last week the MRC released its study of prime time network
coverage of the party conventions. We found four times more extremist
labels were applied to Republicans as Democrats, but Democrats were
tagged liberal twice as often as Republicans were called conservative.
In addition, virtually all of the questions to both parties came from 
the left as the networks portrayed both the Republicans and Democrats
as too conservative. 

<DD>    Last week the Center for Media and Public Affairs also released
its study. CMPA examined not prime time but the ABC, CBS and NBC
evening newscasts during the two convention weeks. Some of their
findings:
<UL>
<LI> "Journalists continued to crowd out the politicians, taking
up 12 times as much airtime as the newsmakers. Reporters' comments
took up 75% of the speaking time in convention stories, compared
to only 6% for the four nominees. Other party officials and delegates
accounted for 10% of the airtime."
<LI>  Both parties' policies got even worse press than their 
candidates -- three to 1 negative overall. Five out of six sources 
(83%) criticized GOP policies, and two out of three (67%) rejected 
the Democrats' stands."
</UL>
<P>
    The Washington Post's John Carmody summarized the finding: 
"Comments on the two issues most talked about -- abortion during
the GOP meeting, welfare during the Democrats' -- suggested a 
left-liberal bent."

<LI>On Tuesday's Today show <a href="#gumbel"> Bryant Gumbel </a> interviewed Susan McDougal
from  jail in Arkansas. But instead of pressing her on why she
won't tell what she knows (for which she's been granted
immunity), Gumbel sympathized with her plight and portrayed her
as a victim of Republican politics. He asked: "Have you any doubt
that Kenneth Starr and his deputies are pursuing an agenda that
is purely political?"
<P>
<LI> CNBC cancels the <a href="#cal"> Cal Thomas </a> show, a decision Thomas says will
only fuel conservative feelings that the media are liberal.

1. Susan McDougal has already been found guilty of fraud
and been jailed for contempt of court for over a week for
refusing to answer questions about Bill Clinton's knowledge of
the fraudulent SBA loan deal. From the September 17 Today show,
here are some of Gumbel's questions to her, transcribed by MRC
intern Matt Turosz:
<P>
    Gumbel: Mrs. McDougal, let me start with you if I might. How
bad has confinement been there in Conway?"
<P>
    Gumbel: "How are you being treated by the authorities and the
other inmates?"
<P>
    Gumbel: "There are those who are obviously hoping that in
prison will prompt a change of heart on you part. Are you having
any second thoughts about refusing to answer questions?"
<P>
    Gumbel then posed his one and only tough question: "According
to reports, you were charged with contempt after being asked to
testify, about whether Bill Clinton knew about an illegal loan or
the purchase of a piece of property with some loan proceeds. Why
have you refused to answer that question?"
<P>
    McDougal responded by claiming Ken Starr had lied to her
before and failed to come through on a deal: "He used witnesses
against me with perjured testimony. Would you buy a used car from
this man. I certainly wouldn't go into a hearing without my
lawyer, into a grand jury room, and answer questions he asked me.
He has lied repeatedly. I won't deal with him."
<P>
    Instead of challenging her, Gumbel summarized her view: "So
basically you don't trust his promises of immunity from
prosecution in exchange for answers to his questions?"
<P>
    McDougal responded: "...He has lied about me. He has lied
during the trial. He has lied after the trial. And he has said
many times give us a proffer, something against the Clintons,
something that we can use, and we'll make all your problems go
away. Well, I'm sorry, that's just not how America works, and
that not how I want to deal with him."
<P>    
Gumbel next queried "Is there any amount of time in jail that
might make your either (A) change your mind or (B) have second
thoughts about trusting Mr. Starr and his deputies?"
<P>
    McDougal answered: "I told you earlier, I become stronger
everyday in my conviction everyday that I sit here."
<P>
    Gumbel then asserted: "Have you any doubt that Kenneth Starr
and his deputies are pursuing an agenda that is purely
political?"
<P>
    McDougal: "I don't believe anyone in America doubts it....I
want to know were I can go to complain about these people's evil
agenda to overrun me to get to the President."
<P>
    Gumbel took the same approach in talking to her lawyer:
"Bobby McDaniel, you said that your client is being used as
political pawn. Have you any legal recourse but to sit there and
watch this unfold?"
<P>
    A couple of questions later Gumbel returned to McDougal and
again bought her premise: "Given that you think this is all just
a Republican witch hunt, do you expect the pressure to ease
somewhat after the election?"
<P>

2. On Monday CNBC announced the cancellation of the weekend
interview shows hosted by Cal Thomas, Al Roker and Gerry Spence.
Thomas's last show (6:30pm and 1am ET Sat. and Sun.) will air in
early October. The Washington Post's John Carmody on Tuesday
quoted Thomas suggesting that the decision will "further the
already deep suspicion among conservatives that the news media is
overwhelmingly liberal."
<P>
    I'll let you know when Thomas finds another outlet and,
hopefully, a more prominent time slot.

<br>
<B>Dear MRC Member</B>,
<BR>
<P>
What happened to the conservative revolution we were all so excited about a year and a half ago? On Election Day 1994 the GOP captured both the House and the Senate, Clinton's socialized health care plan had been demolished, his agenda was in ruins. Most conservatives were celebrating the death of liberalism. 
<P><blockquote><I>I wasn't. I publicly warned that the conservative movement had no idea what was about to hit it.</I></blockquote>
<P>And did it ever. The left-wing press launched the most vicious, dishonest character 
assassination campaign I've ever seen. Newt Gingrich, Dick Armey, and others were vilified daily. The media flat out lied, thousands of times in 
fact, about the Contract with America, saying the "cuts" were going to put women and children, the poor and the elderly, on the streets -- hungry and naked. Clean air, clean water, our national parks -- everything was endangered. 
All because of those "tax cuts for the rich."
<P>You know I'm not exaggerating any of this.The left-wing press stopped at nothing in its attacks. Just look at how they accused the conservative talk radio community of responsibility for the greatest act of terrorism in U.S. history -- the Oklahoma City bombing. It defies belief.
<P>And look at the damage the liberal media caused. Today the Contract with America is 
in shambles. Newt Gingrich has the worst approval rating of any politician in America. And 
Bill Clinton -- considered politically dead one year ago -- is enjoying his highest ratings ever, and leading Bob Dole by 20 points according to some surveys.
<P><I><blockquote>The national press has turned much of America against our ideas by distorting 
everything we stand for. Theirs is an awesome power -- and they are using it.</blockquote></I>
<P>At a national press conference, which took place on June 5, I announced that the 
Media Research Center at <a href="http://www.mediaresearch.org">http://www.mediaresearch.org</a> 
has launched the biggest political counterattack in history to stop these `60s-era elitists once and for all. 
<P>The MRC has been quietly working on our<B> "Tell the Truth!" </B>campaign for months, 
test-marketing it to conservative activists and voters each week. In the past few weeks my staff and I have been interviewed for ABC's <I>Nightline</I>, CNN's <I>Crossfire</I>, CBN's<I> 700 Club</I>, C-SPAN, CNBC, and many other national media outlets. 
<P>A powerful forum for the MRC is talk radio. In the past month, we've conducted over 50 radio interviews which have aired on hundreds of stations, and reached millions of voters. MRC spokesmen have appeared on nationally syndicated shows like the 
<I>G. Gordon Liddy Show</I>, the  <I>Ollie North Show</I>, and the <I>Michael Reagan Show.</I> And, when Rush Limbaugh invited me to host his radio show recently, I used it to show millions of Americans just how distorted the left-wing press has become.
<P>And this is just the tip of the iceberg. We are combining our sophisticated media 
research operation with advanced technology to produce the most comprehensive and 
creative national campaign ever waged to confront, expose, and neutralize the liberal media.
<blockquote><I><P>The MRC <B>"Tell the Truth!"</B> campaign is hitting the liberal press in a way it's never been hit before. We have one message for the left-wing "news" media: Your days of 
unchecked bias are over. </I></blockquote>
<P>I am confident that this critically important campaign will end the media's non-stop 
attacks on conservatives, and put an end to their incessant support for Clinton and his ilk. Because of the urgency and importance of this campaign, your generous gift to the MRC is more vital than ever.<U> Thank you for helping us.</U>
<BR>

<P>       
<BR>
    Bill Clinton snubbed the Christian Coaltion conference over the weekend, 
but the media reacted a bit differently than when Bob Dole decided to not 
address the NAACP. 
<P> 
    Friday night none of the network evening news shows mentioned Clinton's
decision not to appear, though all did pieces on the conference. The issue
came up only on CNN's Inside Politics. In July, all the networks aired stories
about Dole not going to the NAACP convention. (Dole made a surprise appearance 
at the Christian Coalition meeting on Saturday and offered an introduction to
Jack Kemp who had been scheduled.) 
<P>
    Neither ABC or CBS had an evening newscast Saturday night on 
Washington stations because of college football, but NBC did not
get bumped for sports, so let's compare NBC's coverage.
<P>
On the July 10 NBC Nightly News, Jim Miklaszewski reported from the
NAACP gathering:
<P>    
<DD>"No doubt this was a Clinton crowd. That comes as no surprise to Bob 
Dole. Dole had been invited to speak at the convention yesterday, but declined.
He claimed he was already committed to campaigning and the All-Star baseball 
game. To those at this convention that was quite a stretch and an insult to
African-American voters."
<P>    
After explaining how the crowd was very anti-Republican, Miklaszewski
concluded his story: "By not showing up here, Bob Dole may reinforce those
racial divides along party lines and fuel the anxiety among some Republicans 
that in this presidential campaign, Bob Dole may not be up to the challenge."
<P>
On Saturday night's (September 14) NBC Nightly News, David Bloom 
reported:
<P>
<DD>    "Dole decided only this morning to speak to the Christian Coalition 
despite worries inside his campaign that a bow to the religious right might
send the wrong message to moderate, swing voters."
<P>
    Bloom concluded his story:
<P>
<DD>    "Clinton's campaign spokeman said in a statement 'watching Bob Dole arm 
in arm with Pat Robertson speaks volumes to the extreme agenda being pursued 
by the Dole-Kemp-Gingrich team.' Bob Dole tried, perhaps even succeeded today, 
in re-invigorating his Republican base. But a top Clinton campaign official 
was all smiles, saying, 'if you see Dole, tell him thanks for me.'"
<P>
    Anchor Brian Williams then announced: "The Christian Coaltion claims 
almost two million active members and is a potent political force in 31 states, 
but its voice is no longer the lone voice for conservative Christians. NBC's 
Bob Abernethy has our report."
<P>    Abernethy then began his bizarre story on "conservative" Christians:
<P>
<DD>"The Christian Coalition's organization, money and grassroots activism have 
made it one of the most important voices in the country for conservative values, 
especially opposition to abortion. The coalition's success has troubled other
Christians who agree with many of its objectives, but are uncomfortable with
its partisianship, and with what seems to many critics its divisiveness and its
neglect of the poor. One group of coalition critics is the Call to Renewal. 
It heard today from children's advocate Marian Wright Edelman."
<P>
    Abernethy went on to look at Jim Wallis of Sojourners, a left-wing 
crusade. He never got to any "conservative Christians."
<P>
 Let me summarize the differences in approach to one major candidate 
failing to appear at one of the conventions:
<P>
<OL>
    <LI> Dole's snub is big news. Clinton's is not.
    <LI> Dole's decision was "an insult to all African American voters." 
Clinton's was not an insult to all Christian-American voters.
    <LI> Dole's address to the Christian Coalition "might send the wrong message 
to moderate, swing voters." Clinton's appearance before the left-wing NAACP did 
not.
    <LI> Dole's speech prompted NBC to air a bizarre story citing only liberals 
about how the Christian Coalition does not represent all conservative Christians, 
many of whom are "troubled" by its policy views. Clinton's NAACP address did 
not prompt NBC to do a story on how the NAACP does not represent all liberal 
African-Americans or even all African-Americans, nor any consideration of how 
the NAACP's policies "trouble" anyone.
</OL>
<P>
    Tom Brokaw insisted at a June National Press Club appearnace: "We've 
worked very hard to drain the bias out of what we do." Hard to tell.

	Bob Dole demanded that Bill Clinton release his medical records and complained that Clinton's
ads were little more than character assassination. Instead of examining the tone of Clinton ads, 
ABC and CBS portrayed Dole as the villain who has dirtied the until now clean campaign. Only
NBC looked at Clinton's role. On ABC's World News Tonight, Peter Jennings announced: "The campaign for President took a 
nasty turn today. First, Bob Dole departed from his standard stump speech in Kentucky, lashing out
at the Democrats for what he says they are saying about him, and negative advertising was the kindest 
thing Mr. Dole had to say." Reporter Jim Wooten showed clips of Dole complaining about Clinton and of Dole raising the medical records issue. Then he explained:
<P>
<DD>		"Press Secretary McCurry was asked by reporters today if the
		records would show indication of a number of diseases, including
		a sexually transmitted one. He said, no."
<P>
McCurry: "This has been put into play no doubt by those who seek to destroy the President. The President's physician reported on May 24th of this year he was in excellent overall health. Shecould not have done that if any of the allegations about diseases were true."
<P>
Wooten, concluding his piece: "It was bound to come to this no doubt as Senator Dole has been under considerable pressure from his campaign tacticians to begin attacking the President on
issues of personal character. So far he's resisted. Today may have been a signal that he's changing his mind."
<P>
  <DD><I>  So Dole's to blame for a reporter asking about a "sexually
transmitted" disease.</I>
<P>
    Then, Peter Jennings got to the second part of the how the campaign "took a nasty turn today" premise. Immediately after Wooten
finished he introduced the next story: "The President is going to
come under further Republican attack with the release next week
of the House Committee on Government Operations and Oversight's
report on the firings at the White House travel office."
  <P>  On the CBS Evening News Dan Rather followed the same Clinton
as victim theme: "Now for his part, Bob Dole re-opened one of his
favorite lines of attack today about President Clinton's health
records. Phil Jones is our man with the Dole campaign, Phil."
Jones provided a very short piece which dealt only with the
medical records issue, and concluded: "Dan, this campaign is
headed exactly where everybody expected it to go: personal..."
  Only NBC Nightly News bothered to show viewers what so upset
Dole. Tom Brokaw declared: "Bob Dole on the ropes and looking for
a way to boost his sagging campaign made it clear today he is
taking off the gloves in the war of the political airwaves."
    Reporter David Bloom began: "Stung by a barrage of negative
television advertising, Bob Dole today accused Bill Clinton of
running a campaign of fear, of engaging in character
assassination."
    After a clip of Dole, Bloom continued: "At the Democratic
National Convention two weeks ago the President made this
pledge:"<P>
<BR>
<DD>Clinton: "This must be a campaign of ideas, not a campaign of
insults. The American people deserve it."
<DD>Bloom: "But since then, the Dole camp claims the Democrats have
run only 42 positive ads with
<DD> 4,200 negative ads running across
the country."<BR>
<P>
Clips of Clinton ads, including: "If Dole sits here [Oval Office]
and Gingrich runs Congress what could happen. Medicare slashed. A
woman's right to choose gone."
  <P>
  Following another Dole soundbite of Dole and reaction from
the Clinton campaign, Bloom concluded: 
"Dole aides say the campaign will double its ad budget next
week, unveiling new attack ads blaming Clinton for rising teen
drug use, ads even tougher than this one."
Ad: "Bill Clinton said he'd lead the war on drugs and change
America. All he did was change his mind."
Bloom then ended his story by forwarding the "nasty" theme: "At a
Dole rally today the music blared 'get ready.' Get ready, that
is, for a very nasty campaign."

The Pew Research Center for the People and the
Press will be releasing the results of their survey of 1,508
people. Here are some of the more interesting findings:
<P>
<BR>
-- All in all, how would you rate the job the press has done
in covering the presidential campaign so far?
<P>
<DD>          44% Good
<DD>          29% Only fair
<DD>          13% Excellent
 <DD>         11% Poor
<P>
-- How much influence do you think news organizations have on
which candidate becomes President? (Posed only to the 1,141
registered voters in the sample)
<P>
<DD>          64% Too much
<DD>          30% About the right amount
<DD>           4% Too little
<P>
-- Would you say the press has been fair or unfair in the way
it has covered Bill Clinton's election campaign? (Again,
registered voters only, but this time sample of 565)
<P> 
 <DD>        67% Fair
     <DD>     24% Unfair
<P>
    -- Would you say the press has been fair or unfair in the way
it has covered Bob Dole's election campaign? (565 registered
voters)
<P>
       <DD>    65% Fair
<DD>           25% Unfair
<P>
    -- Who do you think most newspaper reporters and TV
journalists want to see win the presidential election -- Bill
Clinton, Bob Dole or Ross Perot? (Posed to sample size of 576)
<P>
         <DD>  59% Clinton
           <DD>17% Dole
<DD>            1% Perot
<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
    So, the media are fair in coverage of both candidates, but the
public thinks that the media have too much influence on who wins and
perceives that reporters hope Clinton will win. Very confusing. --

<h3><a name="cover">Front</a> cover of the September 11, 1996 report:</h3>


<h4>Final Report on 1996 Television Network Convention Coverage:<br>

TV Analysts Label Democrats Twice as Often, But Fire Liberal
Questions<br>
Both Parties Too Conservative for the Networks</h4>
</center>

    Alexandria, VA -- The television networks substantially
increased the number of labels they applied to Democrats during
their 1996 convention over 1992, but at both the Republican and
Democratic conventions this year the networks demanded answers
to a barrage of questions from the left. For Republicans
gathered in San Diego, GOP intolerance on abortion was the
issue. For Democrats convened in Chicago, going too far to the
right on welfare reform became the media focus. Adding up both
questions and statements made by reporters to one another,
abortion or exclusion of pro-choice voices were raised as an
issue 55 times in San Diego, while viewers heard about welfare
reform 43 times in Chicago.<p>

    After producing a daily Media Reality Check '96 newsletter
during the August political conventions, the Media Research
Center's (MRC) news division staff organized its analysis of
prime time coverage into this special 15-page report. This
analysis covers ABC, CBS, CNN (starting at 8pm ET), NBC and the
joint NBC/PBS broadcast.<p> 

    <b>Key findings:</b><br>
<ul>
 <li>Democrats labeled liberal more often than Republicans tagged
conservative. Studies of the 1984, 1988 and 1992 conventions
found Republicans labeled much more frequently than Democrats.
In 1992, the MRC determined the networks applied 118
conservative labels during the GOP conclave, but just 38 liberal
labels during the Democratic gathering. This year, Republicans
were tagged 59 times (13 moderate, 30 conservative, and 16 more
extremist terms), but Democrats were labeled 119 times (44
moderate, 71 liberal and four more extremist terms).<p>

    In Chicago, Bill Clinton got 28 moderate labels and captured
about half as many liberal tags with 16. In San Diego, the
networks focused most of their labeling on conservative
delegates and speakers as Bob Dole went largely untagged --
three moderate and two conservative labels. The Republican
platform was never called moderate and the Democratic platform
was never described as liberal. See page 3 for a summary table
and graph, pages 6-14 for examples.<p>

<li>Convention attendees pummeled with questions from the left
side of the political spectrum. On 51 occasions in San Diego
Republicans were hit with questions from the left, especially
about intolerance and abortion, but they heard just six
inquiries from the right. Two weeks later instead of questioning
Democrats from the right, the networks posed 47 from the left,
the vast majority on how many Democrats opposed President
Clinton's decision to sign the welfare reform bill, but just 11
questions from the right. In this area the networks have grown
more biased. Four years ago, while the GOP got the same
treatment, hearing 131 questions from the left compared to 17
from the right, Democrats got a more even going over with 46
questions from the left and 38 from the right. See page 4 for a
table and graph, pages 7-15 for examples.<p>

<li>Republicans blamed repeatedly for displaying a negative
tone, but Democrats go unscathed despite some pretty vitriolic
speeches. In San Diego the networks characterized Republicans
with terms like "negative," "harsh," "strident" or "mean" or
described GOP speeches as an "attack," 34 times. Democrats were
hit with the negative descriptions just six times during their
convention, but even in Chicago Republicans got hammered more
with 23 references to GOP negativity. In 1992, the networks
questioned the Republican tone as too negative 70 times, but
never once raised the subject against Democrats at their
convention. See page 5 for a summary table and examples of the
contrast.<p>

<li>Controversies such as Whitewater and Travelgate barely
acknowledged. The Clintons are under active investigation by an
independent counsel, but the networks made only seven references
to Democratic scandals. NBC and the joint NBC-PBS broadcast
aired two mentions; ABC, CBS, and CNN, only one. Topics never
mentioned: the FBI files scandal, the Iran-Bosnia scandal, and
the special counsel investigations of Cabinet members such as
Henry Cisneros and Mike Espy. Controversies about Republicans,
such as questions about Elizabeth Dole's blind trust, were also
ignored.
</ul>

<center>
<h3><a name="best">Best</a> and Worst, from page 2 of the 15 page report:</h3>
</center>

<b>Best Network: ABC News </b><br>
    Posed the fewest ideological questions at both conventions,
had the least disparity in blaming the parties for being too
negative and, given the amount of airtime, were the most willing
to identify Democrats as liberal.<p>

<B>Worst Network: CNN</B><br>
    Failed to take advantage of their added airtime to offer
viewers something beyond just more of what the other networks
showed. CNN had the greatest disparity in the agenda of
questions posed, with 23 from the left to just three from the
right.<p>

<B>Best reporters</B><br>
<ul>
<li><B>Sam Donaldson, ABC News:</B> In San Diego he refrained from
gratuitous attacks on the Republicans for being too intolerant.
In Chicago, on the first day of the convention, Donaldson
offered a balanced appraisal of the party delegates, noting that
the Democratic delegates "are far to the left of the mainstream
just as the Republicans were to the right of the mainstream." In
the midst of hoopla over Bill Clinton's speech, only Donaldson
realized that while he gave a "great speech," the "record shows
that the next day he may give a different speech, change his
mind, trim it a little bit, do something else."<p>

 <li><B>Lisa Myers, NBC News: </B>One of the few reporters to pose
questions from both the left and right. In San Diego, she asked
Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison from the right about how she "has
generally opposed efforts to cut off benefits to illegal
immigrants, particularly education and health benefits. Why
would hardworking American taxpayers pay for people who are here
illegally?" Then she asked her about how people who saw her
speech "found it too negative. They didn't particularly like the
degree to which you attacked the President. In retrospect, do
you think you went too far?" On the first night in Chicago,
Myers quizzed a delegate about whether liberals or New Democrats
control the party.<p> 

 <li><B>Brian Ross, ABC News:</B> Although CNN's Brooks Jackson appeared
early in prime time with stories on corporate contributions and
union influence, ABC's Ross deserves recognition despite the
fact his pieces did not air in prime time. In a series of World
News Tonight stories, Ross went after the big money contributors
to both parties. Ross raised unique issues, such as "the giant
media corporations...very much in the middle of the mix." In San
Diego he noted that "the ABC hospitality suite was a lobbyist's
dream." In Chicago he looked at one big donor: "His name is
Arthur Coia, who despite being president of a labor union the
FBI says has long been controlled by the Mafia...has become one
of the Democrats' top money people."<p>
</ul>

<B>Worst reporters:</B><br>
<ul>
 <li><B>Maria Shriver, NBC News:</B>  Seemed baffled why a rape victim
would have anything to do with the GOP and her interview with
Hillary Clinton following the First Lady's address was more like
two old friends sharing tales of their suffering than a
dispassionate interview. Just after Jan Licence addressed
Republicans about victim's rights, Shriver asked her: "But why
[speak] at a Republican convention? So many people have said
that they don't think this ticket, or perhaps this party, is
supportive of women's issues. Why make this stand here?"
Shriver's interview with the First Lady assumed Mrs. Clinton had
been unfairly attacked by Republicans. Shriver posed questions
like, "This has been a difficult couple of years for you. Did
that applause, the way you've been treated here, the way people
have been reacting to you, kind of make it all go away?" And,
noting GOP criticism of her book, Shriver wondered, "How did
that affect you when you heard about that?"<p>

<li><B>Judy Woodruff, CNN:</B> In San Diego she demanded that
Republicans explain why there weren't more female delegates, but
in Chicago instead of challenging Democrats on the appeal of
their pro-partial birth abortion stand, she worried about
welfare reform going too far. Woodruff peppered Mrs. Clinton
with six welfare questions, all from the left. She pleaded with
her to stop it: "Eleanor Roosevelt, whom you admire, mentioned
her again just now, said that much of the time she kept her
disagreements with the President to herself in private, but
there were times that she felt it was important to disagree
publicly. Does there ever come a time with you, and if not
welfare reform, then what?"<p>

<li><B>Tom Brokaw, NBC News:</B> Found Republican speakers threatened
to be perceived as too mean, took a pot shot at Ronald Reagan,
and portrayed Republicans as insensitive to rape, but praised
the speaking power of Democrats. In San Diego he warned that the
GOP knows "it has to lower the threshold of perceived meanness
on the part of the country." In Chicago, after Jesse Jackson's
speech which attacked conservatives, he admired how his words
grew "out of a very deep passion." Brokaw did at least mention
Whitewater in Chicago, but after the moving tribute to Ronald
Reagan in San Diego he took this swipe: "Ronald Reagan will have
to learn how history will judge his time in office -- the
deficits, the Iran-Contra affair." At the GOP conclave he told
rape victim Jan Licence: "This is a party that is dominated by
men," so, he wondered, "do you think before tonight they ever
thought about what happens in America with rape?"

The chopper developed a mechanical problem, landed hard, flipped, and burst into flames. Santa's fake whiskers caught fire and his pillow-belly got snagged on the seatbelt. These unsuspected hazards urgently call for a new federal bureau and <I>scads</I> of regulations to keep Mr. Claus safe! Fortunately, the pilot wriggled free and pulled Santa out, and both sprinted to safety just before the helicopter blew up.

<LI>How much money would John Sweeney have had to spend on the 1996 election if union members had had a say in spending it? Four years ago, the state of Washington conducted an experiment. Voters passed a ballot initiative making it illegal to dock an employee's wages (e.g., through union dues) for political purposes ``except upon written request of the employee.'' The Washington Education Association found that contributions to its PAC fell by five-sixths. (The WEA tried to funnel dues through a ``Community Outreach Program,'' a PAC by another name, but the state took a dim view of this.) Divide Sweeney money by six, and the Democrats would have picked up only one House seat. And they might have lost another ten seats in the Senate.

<LI>Try to follow this plot line: Because the investigation of President Clinton has become too politicized James Carville says he will form an organization devoted to partisan attacks on the man conducting it, without the consent of the White House, which is such an irresponsible scheme with such an unlikely cover story that it lands Carville on every public-affairs TV show in the land over a two-week period; at which point the President privately says he doesn't approve of Carville's effort, which was never contingent on his approval, but Carville nonetheless decides to shut it down without ever starting it because all the negative publicity has been so helpful, including the attacks on him as a ``frothing, rabid dog'' made by Mary Matalin, his wife. Just the latest from the <I>Carville & Matalin Show</I>, airing wherever in America there's a camera or the chance of a good lecture fee.

<LI>Defense ministers of seven nations (Austria, Canada, Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, and Sweden) have agreed to establish a standby peacekeeping brigade to be at the disposal of the UN Security Council. The force is to be formed by 1999. Americans should welcome this: it means that U.S. forces, already stretched too thin, will not need to be drawn into every humanitarian emergency. The U.S. has its veto in the Security Council (and should be willing to pay a fair share of the cost of missions it does not veto).

<LI>On the matter of Iraq and oil, it is a very tough call. The objections are not easily coped with. (If Saddam Hussein really cares about helping the drastically sick, why doesn't he build one castle fewer for himself? If Saddam Hussein cares for the strategic prospects of his people, why does he channel the country toward war and devastation?) But after we do the analytical arpeggios we aren't left with anything more obvious than the terrible hunger and illness of the Iraqis. So we are permitting $2 billion in oil sales, and the proceeds will be distributed under UN supervision (61 per cent food, 16 per cent medicine, 5 per cent soap . . .). Will Saddam manage to cheat in the course of things? Yes. Will the world attempt to transform our approval into a reason for granting Iraq greater oil sales in the future? Yes. Is there anything we can do about it, at this point? No. But we do need to remind Saddam that we are looking at him. Maybe send him an exploding cigar every now and then.

<LI>Williams College has become a nest of progressive activity. From forcing women to use unisex toilets and showers (to make them ``less self-conscious about their bodies''), to compelling heterosexual students to declare themselves homosexuals in public (to appreciate how it feels), Williams has embraced Political Correctness like a desperate lover. Williams's admissions policy is ultra-affirmative-action, of course. But perhaps the most comic aspect of Williams's new identity is the discovery that it was offering course credit to students who joined in activities organized by Western Massachusetts Labor Action, which has been linked to the recently raided and heavily armed Provisional Communist Party in Brooklyn. Conceivably, the professors and administrators at Williams were unaware of the connection.

<LI>The Heritage Foundation has produced an impressive new volume, <I>Restoring American Leadership: A U.S. Foreign and Defense Policy Blueprint</I>. The Heritage team of experts, directed by Kim R. Holmes and Thomas G. Moore, surveys the fundamental problems of U.S. national strategy, in areas such as regional challenges (especially in Europe, the Far East, and the Middle East), defense policy, economic policy, and the tools of policymaking (the UN, intelligence, foreign aid, public diplomacy). It is a well-done critique, with wise prescriptions -- a needed antidote to isolationist undercurrents that would leave the world a more dangerous place.

<LI>For 12 days in November, French truck drivers went on strike demanding early retirement, shorter working hours, and more pay. They did not merely refuse to work, which is their right, but also set up blockades -- at ports, on freeways, and around oil refineries. Road transport was massively disrupted, stocks of food and gasoline ran low, and foreign truck drivers, held hostage in the blockades, were compelled to live in their cabins. One British driver who protested was admitted to intensive care after being severely beaten by French truckers. Throughout the entire crisis, the government insisted that it would not ``use force'' to break the blockades. It thereby admitted that it was not prepared to fulfill its duty to uphold the rule of law. The settlement with the truckers will cost $700 million, and the country now faces hundreds of millions of dollars in claims from companies abroad that were hard hit. The French economy also suffered severely. But this is merely the tribute which a decadent political system must pay to any interest group willing to trample the common good.

<LI>A study published recently in the <I>American Journal of Public Health</I> suggests that racial discrimination by whites causes high blood pressure in blacks. Curiously, it was among blacks who were unaware that they had suffered discrimination that the effect was most pronounced. Dr. Nancy Krieger explained that this was a consequence of ``suppressed or internalized response.'' The study did not address the effect that black-on-white crime -- which, according to Irving Louis Horowitz in the January 1995 <I>Society</I>, is sixty times as common as white-on-black crime  -- has on the health of whites.

<FONT SIZE=+3>M</FONT><font size=+1>Y</font> mother reports that as a toddler I touched a hot stove only once, displaying an early ability to learn from experience. (Of course, I wasn't a blonde back then.) This ability is in surprisingly short supply among congressional Republicans. Still worshipping at the shrine of deficit reduction, some GOP congressmen are itching to make a technical adjustment in the government's inflation index. The idea is that this would dramatically reduce the deficit over the next few years. But it would do so by raising taxes and reducing Social Security benefits. The Republicans' only concession to their own political health is to insist that Bill Clinton lead the way over this particular cliff.
<P>
Economists agree that the Consumer Price Index, which measures consumer prices for a fixed market basket of goods and services, exaggerates the cost of living. As Ed Rubenstein explains in greater detail, because the CPI doesn't allow for consumers' tendency to substitute cheaper goods for higher-priced ones, the growing popularity of discount shopping, or the higher quality of new products, it overstates increases in the cost of living. It thus inflates the cost-of-living adjustments used to index Social Security and military retirees' benefits, and income-tax brackets, personal exemptions, and the standard deduction. 
<P>
A commission of economists headed by Michael Boskin, Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors under George Bush, recently concluded that the CPI probably overstates inflation by (a misleadingly precise) 1.1 percentage points a year. The percentage looks small, but the consequences of adjusting the CPI would be enormous.
<P>
First, the good news. Economic performance over the past two decades has been much better than indicated by the faulty CPI. Properly measured, real median family income has risen by 36 per cent since 1972, not by 4 per cent as current government statistics indicate. So we have been better off than we thought -- but many of us are not going to be as well off in the future if the CPI is adjusted downward. That's the red-hot stove that some politicians are sorely tempted to touch.
<P>
They are tempted because a 1-point downward adjustment in the CPI would reduce deficits by $600 billion over the next ten years, thereby making their pledge to balance the budget far easier to live up to. Most of the saving would come from lower benefit payments, but the Joint Economic Committee points out that roughly 40 per cent of it will come in the form of higher taxes on ``primarily middle-class taxpayers.'' Uh-oh. Benefit cuts and tax increases? Whose responsibility will this combustible combination be?
<P>
The clearly erroneous index is calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which can be expected to make some needed adjustments over time. But the Boskin Commission recommended that the President and Congress make a larger adjustment and make it now. Senate Finance Committee Chairman William Roth stresses that any change must be ``broadly and deeply bi-partisan.'' Like the congressional pay raise of seven years ago?
<P>
Some conservatives are warning Republican legislators of the dangers they face. Steve Forbes predicts that if Republicans are seen as advocating tax increases and benefit cuts they will squander the political capital needed to make the reforms that are really needed in the whole structure of Social Security. ``If Republicans get caught up in looking as if we're trying to do something to current recipients, we'll be hammered the way we were on Medicare,'' says Forbes, who urges members of Congress to ``look at the big picture -- a major reform of Social Security for young people.'' 
<P>
Forbes is not alone. Dave Mastio, writing in <I>Slate</I>, points out that adopting Boskin's recommendation for reducing Social Security COLAs would abort the growing interest in Social Security reform by providing a short-term fix to the trust fund's financial problems. 
<P>
Leila Bates, director of tax and budget policy at Citizens for a Sound Economy, believes it is up to Bill Clinton to prod the BLS to reform the index. ``Republicans shouldn't want to be accused of raising taxes and cutting benefits,'' she states.
<P>
Senator Pat Moynihan, Capitol Hill's biggest enthusiast for a downward adjustment to the CPI precisely <I>because</I> it would stall major Social Security reforms, declares ``We're not trying to cut, we're not trying to raise. We're proposing an accurate count.'' But Republicans who spent the past year making unlistened-to arguments about reductions in the rate of growth of Medicare shouldn't relish spending the next two years playing defense on Social Security reductions.
<P>
<font size=+3>A</font><font size=+1>ND</font> they would be facing the same tormentors. The American Association of Retired Persons and the AFL - CIO oppose a major CPI adjustment. Bill Clinton might embrace it now, and later get away with distancing himself from this ``Republican reduction in benefits.'' Which is how House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt could be counted on to describe it even if the Administration was supporting it.
<P>
Congressman Chris Cox (R., Calif.) believes that it is up to the Bureau of Labor Statistics to see that the CPI is as accurate as possible and rejects the Boskin plan as a way to cut spending. Unlike too many members who are yearning to reduce the deficit ``painlessly,'' Cox scorns the ``Darmanesque gimmick'' of using COLA cuts to achieve ``so-called savings,'' and he doesn't want government revenues to increase as much as they would under the Boskin plan.
<P>
Congressman David McIntosh (R., Ind.) agrees that it would be a ``terrible idea'' for Congress to adjust the CPI in a way that would impose ``a hidden tax increase on the middle class.'' 
<P>
Republicans in Congress should let the Bureau of Labor Statistics make appropriate adjustments in the market basket used to calculate the CPI. The only downward adjustments they should be contemplating are in our record tax and spending levels.

<H2>Carl Rowan's Lurch</H2></CENTER>
<HR>
<P>
NEW YORK, DECEMBER 12<br>









Mr. Al Neuharth, the publisher emeritus of <I>USA Today</I>, advised his readers, ``This is a book that will scare the bejesus out of most of us.'' He is talking about Carl Rowan's <I>The Coming Race War in America</I>. ``[Rowan] makes a scary case that hatemongers are hurling us toward an inevitable racial Armageddon.''
<P>
In the event you haven't time to read this column to the end, let me reassure you right away that there is every reason for all of us to be scared by Jesus, Who ordained that we should lead better lives than most of us do, but there is no reason for the bejesus to be scared out of us by the book in question, which is alarmist, silly, and quite stupid. 
<P>
Mr. Neuharth, in his review, repeats the names of the ten principal ``hatemongers'' in America. It is at times like these that one sighs for the better days when the libel laws could be invoked. Among the top ten hatemongers in America, if you will believe Carl Rowan -- which you will do if you take leave of your senses -- are Newt Gingrich and Richard Cohen (of the <I>Washington Post</I>). Why is Newt Gingrich a hatemonger? ``For a generation we have seen a law-enforcement version of genocide: our failed drug war has incarcerated, or destroyed the reputations of, a fourth of the young black men in this country. And now we hear a Democratic President, Bill Clinton, endorse 'boot camps' for first-time violators of the law. And Newt Gingrich urging a 'wartime' stance in which the Federal Government builds detention camps. Welcome to the old South Africa and Nazi Germany!'' 
<P>
The opening line in Mr. Rowan's book is, ``Sensational, inflammatory journalism has never been my style. I have never written dire prophecies of human disasters except when there was compelling evidence that calamity was at hand.'' 
<P>
Well, is such evidence at hand? Yes, it is all over the place, says Mr. Rowan. There is ``the cruelly bigoted rhetoric that often befouls the well of the House of Representatives.'' The ``swastikas and Ku Klux Klan symbols that festoon our military barracks.'' That <I>what</I> our barracks? <I>Decorate</I> our barracks? 
<P>
But that is the way Mr. Rowan writes. Here he is on Ronald Reagan. ``No President in my lifetime ever played the race card to such political benefit as Reagan did. His fulminations about welfare, his loud support of states' rights, his publicity stunts -- including opening a re-election campaign in Philadelphia, Mississippi, where three civil-rights workers (two Jewish, one black) had been murdered -- helped to rip most of the South away from Democratic control.''
<P>
If you can be brought to believe that President Reagan opened his re-election campaign in a town in Mississippi because three civil-rights workers had been murdered there, intending to identify himself with the cause of the murderers, then you are ready to believe that Carl Rowan has his wits about him. 
<P>
``What I will never forget or forgive is that Reagan had no minorities of consequence inside his campaign team. His Cabinet had only one black man in it, and he was embarrassing. And worst of all, Reagan went eight years refusing to talk to any civil-rights leaders.'' 
<P>
Now get this, the very next sentence. After Reagan's ``refusal to talk to any civil-rights leaders.'' Ready? ``When I asked him why, in 1988, he invited me to lunch.'' That is how difficult it was for a prominent black to get a look at President Reagan. You call him up, he asks you to lunch. 
<P>
What did he say at lunch? 
<P>
``They criticized me upon my election, so I just said, 'To hell with 'em.''' There are several possible reactions on the part of the reader. 1) Rowan misquoted Reagan. (People who know Reagan well know the intensity of his commitment to racial equality.) 2) Reagan said it, in the sense of: ``What can I do with civil-rights leaders who insist on being hostile to me?'' And 3) Reagan said it and went on to guard against the kind of interpretation Rowan has of course put on it. 
<P>
It goes on. Irving Kristol ``dispenses quota crap.'' ``In September, the newspaper of the Invisible Empire, Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, declared Reagan its favorite candidate, asserting that 'the Republican platform reads as if it were written by a Klansman.''' Well, Mr. Rowan's book reads as if it were written by a besotted simpleton, which it was.

NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY -- DOCUMENT EXTRACT Telephone Transcript 12/16/96<br>

VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Rusty? Rusty? I'm not sure if the satellite link is working. I can't hear you. Static.<br> 
VPOTUS: So let me just say, Merry Christmas. And did you get the fruitcake? Static.<br>

PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Hey, Al, Got a sec? <br> 
VPOTUS: Sure, Bill. What's up?<br> 
POTUS: Well, this is a delicate matter. You see, Jim Carville is hitting Ken Starr pretty hard, and --<br>  
VPOTUS: Bill, I understand completely.<br> 
POTUS: You do?<br>  
VPOTUS: Sure. You want to come out publicly and say, ``Hey! Jim's right! Ken Starr is a partisan attack dog!'' And may I say, Bill, right on!<br>  
POTUS: Actually, Al, I want to do the opposite.<br>  
VPOTUS: You want to come out publicly and say, ``Hey! Jim's wrong! Ken Starr is a fair-minded investigator who's about to indict my wife?''<br> 
POTUS: Something between the two.<br>  
VPOTUS: Okay.<br>  
POTUS: See, if we keep -- I mean, if Jim keeps -- hitting Ken Starr like we are -- I mean, like he is -- well, it's starting to backfire. The press is against us -- I mean, against him -- and it just looks like Hillary and I are scared.<br>  
VPOTUS: And you're not, right?<br>  
POTUS: No, we are. Very. So why keep picking on this guy and making him mad? Let him take the McDougals and Hale and Kendall and Hillary's secretary and Marceca and Livingstone and whoever else. Let him take 'em all. That's business. There's no need to make it personal, you know?<br>  
VPOTUS: I guess I see your point. But, darn it, I think Ken Starr is on a partisan witch hunt.<br>  
POTUS: Well, Al, I agree with you. But it's not your witch he's after. Click. Line dead. 11:23 <br> 
VPOTUS: Hi, Jim.<br> 
UNIDENTIFIED SOUTHERN MALE: Yeah, hey, Mr. Vice President. How'ya doin' up there?<br>  
VPOTUS: I'm okay, Jim. How are you? <br> 
UNSOMA: Okay, I guess.<br>

VPOTUS: As I know you know, the President can't publicly support what you've been saying, but between you and me, you're doing a terrific job.<br> 
UNSOMA: Yeah okay, but I'm knockin' my head against the wall here like a rat in a coffee can, you know? I'm marching up and down the street all alone out here like it was Gay Pride Day in Salt Lake City, you know?<br>  
VPOTUS: I'm not following you, Jim.<br>  
UNSOMA: Thas jes' what I mean, sir. Not a one is followin' me. I'm out here by lonesome Jim's self.<br> 
VPOTUS: Well, to be honest, Jim, the crusade -- while well meant and absolutely one hundred per cent justified -- well, it's backfiring a little.<br> 
UNSOMA: Backfiring?<br>  
VPOTUS: Yeah. So we thought, Hey, maybe old Jim has done his bit, let's just all back off some so that the thing doesn't blow up in our faces. You know, if we keep hitting Starr and keep hitting Starr and then he indicts, oh, just for the sake of argument, you-know-who --<br>  
UNSOMA: Who?<br>  
VPOTUS: Think, Jim.<br>  
UNSOMA: I am thinking.<br>  
VPOTUS: Think harder. Think perjury. Think obstruction of justice.<br>  
UNSOMA: The President?<br>  
VPOTUS: Well, I meant Hillary, but I see your point. Look, we all appreciate your efforts, but to continue would only hurt the President. And as much as I'd like to be President myself, I'd rather win it fair and square, not by waving goodbye on the White House lawn while Marine One choppers out. That would just get really weird. I mean, Chelsea would probably have to stay with us while she finished school, and Tipper just hates what they've done to the Blue Room, and --<br>  
UNSOMA: So you want me to quit?<br>  
VPOTUS: Yeah, Jim.<br>  
UNSOMA: Jes' pack it in?<br>  
VPOTUS: Please. For Bill.<br>  
UNSOMA: Well, okay. But I'm not giving the money back.<br>  
VPOTUS: What money?<br>  
UNSOMA: Last week we got a check for $25,000 to keep up the heat on Ken Starr.<br>

<FONT SIZE=+3>H</FONT><font size=+1>aving</font> written off Bill Clinton for most of 1995, Republicans are now tempted to ascribe supernatural powers of persuasion to him. Neither attitude encourages constructive thought on how to counter his strategy. But despite the image of an Administration adrift, President Clinton has arrived, through a mixture of accident and design, at a strategy for Democrats to survive and perhaps even prosper in ideologically uncongenial times. While there may not be a Clintonian ideology, it is possible to speak of a Clintonian style of politics.
<P>
Its most important feature has been the attempted retooling of the Democratic Party as the servant of middle-class interests through the mechanism of government. Clinton pollster Stan Greenberg explained the reasoning in a much-noted essay in the Fall 1991 <I>American Prospect</I>: ``Democrats need to rediscover broad-based social policy that sends a larger message: Democrats are for 'everybody,' not just the 'have-nots.' That means defending and enlarging social insurance initiatives that reach the lower and middle classes rather than constructing safety nets that protect only the poor.'' Means-tested programs stigmatize recipients and are, Greenberg thinks, easy to cut; middle-class entitlements are forever.
<P>
National health insurance, a longstanding goal of the Left, was thus also a means of expanding the Democratic voter base and creating a permanent Democratic majority. It would do to the middle class what Social Security had done to the elderly: make a majority of them beholden to the Federal Government and its political champions, in this case for their very lives. As Grace-Marie Arnett points out, the Clintons have pursued this objective with essentially Fabian tactics. They have tried to establish beachheads within the health-care market from which to launch new government interventions. The Clintons' 1993 - 94 health-care ``reform'' effort would have been a large, and probably irreversible, step toward socialized medicine. Time is already beginning to obscure just how close they came.
<P>
Clinton's repeated proposals to expand subsidies for higher education are a smaller-scale version of the same entitlement strategy. The government will now step forward to finance increased access to the very sectors of the economy the government has most inflated. It's a proposal well crafted to help Clinton make inroads among traditional GOP strongholds in the middle class and even upper middle class. The Republican Congress has forced Clinton to spend more time playing defense: instead of increasing public dependence on government, he has been vigilantly blocking cuts in government programs that benefit people who work. Clinton's massive expansion of the earned income tax credit, and subsequent determination to protect that expansion from Republican budget-cutters, is a case in point.
<P>
Even on welfare, where President Clinton has felt it necessary to appear responsive to middle-class demands for reform and retrenchment, he has assiduously avoided policies that would reduce the scope and power of government or its allied institutions in liberaldom. Indeed, as Robert Rector observes, Clinton originally sought window-dressing reforms that would actually increase the power of the welfare establishment.
<P>
After the Republicans took Congress, he moved toward a liberal version of welfare reform, which, geared as it is toward processing people through welfare rather than keeping them off it, creates opportunities for expanding state services: child-care subsidies, job training, transportation assistance, child-support enforcement. Clinton has followed a similar pattern on education: he has a long history of supporting the least reform the public demands and the most the education establishment will tolerate. So, for instance, he's all in favor of charter schools, as long as they don't escape the burden of federal regulations or threaten the power of teachers' unions.
<P>
To woo the middle class, Clinton has also had to tack center-right on ``values.'' Greenberg readily acknowledged the point in his 1991 essay: ``Democrats cannot win over the average family,'' he wrote, ``unless there are some limits on the party's moral agnosticism.'' Clinton's cultural rhetoric is now to the right of George Bush's. We know that President Clinton read Ben Wattenberg's <I>Values Matter Most</I>, and he has talked incessantly about ``values'' ever since. (The popularity of that word ought, incidentally, to depress conservatives. ``'Values' beat 'virtues' eleven to nothing in a focus group we did,'' says pollster Kellyanne Fitzpatrick. ``It's amazing Bill Bennett sold any books.'')
<P>
On social and cultural issues, Clinton has used the bully pulpit quite effectively to signal that he shares the public's values. And if, when Clinton says that he supports introducing school uniforms or firing incompetent teachers, some people are misled to believe that he has some policy initiative to translate the rhetoric into reality, well, that's no skin off his back. He has struck a particularly tough pose on crime, though, as David Kopel observes, there is much less to his record than meets the eye. Clinton's gauzy communitarian rhetoric is also deployed on fiscal issues. During last fall's budget showdown, he was constantly claiming to be defending ``our values'' from Republicans intent on taking medicine away from the elderly and protection from the environment. This kind of values-laden talk is probably necessary for parties of the Center - Left for the foreseeable future. (Tony Blair, leader of Britain's Labour Party, does it too.)
<P>
In addition to pulling more middle-class voters into the Democratic coalition, President Clinton also wanted to co-opt parts of American business. In some respects, ClintonCare was a failed attempt to do so: it offered major financial benefits to large manufacturers and insurers. The Administration's support for high-tech subsidies was a play for Silicon Valley. The re-orientation of American trade policy toward bilateral deals, sometimes company-specific, enabled the Administration to dispense favors to exporters at its discretion. And the ultimate logic of the ``corporate responsibility'' themes many Democrats are pushing is to transform American businesses into docile servants of the welfare state.
<P>
<font size=+3>I</font><font size=+1>N HIS</font> zeal to expand his base, Clinton has not forgotten more reliable Democratic constituencies. So federal funding of labor unions has increased (and it has been made easier for them to use compulsory dues on political activity). The Violence Against Women Act has funneled money to feminist organizations, and ``AIDS education'' programs to the gay Left. The 1993 ``stimulus'' bill was a payback to big-city mayors; when it failed, much of its substance was included in the next year's crime bill. Restrictions on the politicization of the federal work force have been loosened considerably.
<P>
Clinton's sheer political talent should not be underestimated as a factor in the success of this strategy. Nor, for that matter, should the frequency and facility of his lies. He is able to call high-mindedly for bipartisan statesmanship and then, in the next breath, launch a furious attack on the motives of his opponents -- who, we are to believe, <I>want</I> children to drink dirty water, eat diseased meat, and smoke. Yet Clinton is simultaneously a soothing figure. He is able to appeal to that strain of public sentiment that wants the noise and bickering from Washington to stop. His rhetoric is also appealing because it tells the voters they can have it all: a balanced budget without cutting entitlements; environmental regulation without economic costs; welfare reform without anyone suffering. He's the perfect practitioner of the politics of painlessness: for everything that's good, against everything bad. (In fairness, some Republicans, particularly of the Gingrich - Kemp brand, are prone to this as well.)
<P>
Another reason for Clintonism's success is that, as many commentators have noted, this White House focuses on its political health to an unprecedented degree. American foreign policy toward Ireland and Haiti has been driven largely by domestic political considerations. The church-burning issue was basically a whipped-up hysteria designed to persuade black voters that white racism is still the chief threat to their well-being. And the Administration skillfully orchestrates the appearance of a constant flurry of activity -- no matter how microscopic the initiative or gesture, how inadequate the rapid response. The Administration provides motion without progress, a perpetual campaign. President Clinton hasn't declared for re-election; would anyone notice if he did?
<P>
The chief vulnerability of Clintonism is that even the boldest New Democrat cannot afford to cross some constituencies that are out of sync with the public. Clinton can't sign legal reform because of the trial lawyers. He was willing to anger organized labor over NAFTA, but he has done its bidding on striker replacement and other workplace issues; if the Democrats do well this November, they will be greatly indebted to the AFL-CIO's vigorous campaign on their behalf. And Clinton would not have dared to sign the bill banning partial-birth abortions for fear of incurring the wrath of feminists, a calculation that highlights the vacuum where Clintonism's moral core should be. But the issue that most devastatingly gives the lie to Clinton's pretensions of conservatism -- his support of race and gender preferences -- appears to have been dropped by his opposition.
<P>
The consolation for conservatives is that Clinton doesn't move the debate; he merely positions himself within it. In the first year of the Administration, William Kristol compared the condition of American liberalism to that of Soviet Communism in the late 1970s: both were seemingly dominant, both utterly hollow. For a time it was fashionable in conservative circles to describe health-care reform as liberalism's Afghanistan, the fatal overreach that would precipitate the empire's collapse. Yet in neither case has the old order been unequivocally defeated.
<P>
Now, writes Johnathan Sunley in the summer <I>National Interest</I>, ``Communism as a dogma is dead. . . . The problem facing supposedly 'post-Communist' societies is not a revival of that ideology, but the survival of power structures that escaped the 'revolutions' of 1989 more or less unscathed.'' Just so with contemporary liberalism and the ``revolution'' of 1994. If Bill Clinton wins re-election, his legacy could be that America enters the twenty-first century shackled by the institutional residua of an ideology almost nobody any longer believes.

<FONT SIZE=+3>T</FONT><font size=+1>HE</font> pledge to ``end welfare as we know it'' was the centerpiece of Bill Clinton's 1992 campaign. Voters were blitzed with TV ads promising to put welfare recipients to work and proposing an apparent two-year time limit on receipt of benefits. But on no topic has the Clintonian chasm between word and deed been broader than on welfare.
<P>
Americans have lived through many an ``end to welfare.'' In 1988, Congress passed the ``Family Support Act,'' a mammoth bipartisan reform that was promised ``to replace welfare with work.'' In reality, the bill required almost no one to work; AFDC caseloads ballooned by 30 per cent.
<P>
Nearly 90 per cent of voters still want welfare recipients to work for benefits. Their antipathy to the existing welfare system creates a real hurdle for liberal legislators seeking to preserve and expand it. Hence, even the most left-wing proposals now come well armored in conservative slogans. By the mid Eighties periodic sham reform had become welfare's life blood, assuaging public discontent while masking the growth of the system.
<P>
Initially, it seemed Clinton might break this pattern. In his first month in office, he repeated his promise to end welfare and to make recipients work. In addition, in a speech before the National Governors' Association, he promised to encourage state welfare experimentation through waivers. Critically, he proposed to ``approve waivers that I did not necessarily agree with . . . the nature of the experiment is that one person has an idea different from another person.''
<P>
Reality quickly began to jostle the political rhetoric. President Clinton appointed, as head of HHS, Donna Shalala, who had served with Mrs. Clinton on the board of the Children's Defense Fund, an organization that had opposed even the token reforms of 1988. Charged with implementing Mr. Clinton's key campaign pledge to end welfare, Miss Shalala gave only a single grudging sentence to the topic in her confirmation testimony. Senator Moynihan felt compelled to upbraid her for her indifference.
<P>
Conservatives willing to give Clinton the benefit of the doubt on welfare, including this author, had their illusions dispelled abruptly when the President unveiled his first budget. Work had disappeared from the agenda. Clinton had stated that the ``reform'' of 1988 had been well designed but had been crippled by a lack of funds for JOBS, the program that nominally enforced work requirements.
<P>
By Washington standards, JOBS was a dwarf program costing about $1 billion out of an annual welfare spending pot of $234 billion. Thus, if lack of money were really holding up reform, it would be easy to jump-start ``work, not welfare,'' by giving it more.
<P>
But Clinton's budget didn't add one thin dime to the work program. He did propose large increases in almost every other type of welfare spending. Proposed new spending initiatives in conventional welfare programs (food stamps, housing, Head Start, etc.) amounted, over five years, to $100 billion above the already explosive growth in baseline spending. Having, on the campaign trail, trumpeted ``ending welfare'' and making recipients work, Clinton in office did exactly the opposite: ignoring workfare while seeking to expand traditional welfare spending.
<P>
Bolder reversals followed. The 1988 reform, pathetic though it was, included some minute work requirements squeezed in, with great effort, by conservative legislators. Avoiding undue haste, the liberal Congress decreed that these work requirements were not to take effect until 1994 (six years after passage) and would affect only some two-parent families comprising 6 per cent of the AFDC rolls. These provisions were the first and only work requirements passed into law. The Clinton Administration quietly sought to abolish them, through a change hidden deep within the vast Omnibus Budget Act. This maneuver outraged even the <I>New York Times</I>, and the attempted repeal failed.
<P>
While retreating at full speed on the work issue, President Clinton did break decisive new ground on another, unexpected front. Although he had predictably attacked Dan Quayle's Murphy Brown speech on illegitimacy, Clinton reversed course once in office. He began to speak out against rising illegitimacy, warning that the collapse of marriage was a root cause of crime and other social problems. On television, he acknowledged that Charles Murray was right: welfare promoted out-of-wedlock births. In his first State of the Union address, Clinton warned that society was threatened by an illegitimate birth rate that would soon hit 50 per cent.
<P>
Of course, Clinton never intended actually to do anything about illegitimacy. But, often, a President's words do count. And no President, including Ronald Reagan, had ever spoken this way against illegitimacy. Like Nixon's trip to China, Clinton's speeches about marriage and illegitimacy permanently altered the national debate. An issue which many politicians had been afraid even to mention was now raised to prominence, even urgency. For this, the country owes Bill Clinton a profound debt of thanks.
<P>
In the realm of deed rather than word, however, the Clinton Administration continued to drift left. While still arguing that more funding was the key to reform, Clinton again failed in his second budget to provide more money for workfare thus ensuring that his campaign pledge to make welfare recipients work would not even begin to take effect until 1996, if at all. Finally, in the summer of 1994, Clinton unveiled his grand welfare-reform plan. Not surprisingly, it was a parody of liberal anti-reforms parading in conservative prose. It didn't require work, and effectively prohibited states from doing so. There was no ``two years and off'' rule. In its place was the following provision: no one would be required to work for the first two years on welfare; among those exceeding the two-year limit, some tiny portion would be required to do community-service work but only under restrictions that would make dependency reduction impossible.
<P>
Although 70 per cent of the AFDC caseload at any given time have been on welfare for over two years, the bill required only 7 per cent of the caseload to work by 1999. These welfare recipients would work only 15 hours per week and would receive an effective wage of $15 per hour (counting all benefits). The bill allocated $4,000 in administrative overhead for each workfare participant. At many job sites, recipients doing community-service work would become members of public-sector unions. The Clinton Administration had been truthful on one point: ``ending welfare as we know it'' in this manner would cost a lot more than the status quo. The real costs of the proposal were discreetly hidden, off budget, in future years.
<p>
On illegitimacy, the bill proposed the status quo and triumphantly called it reform. To obtain welfare, unwed mothers under age 18 would have to live with their parents. But 90 per cent of out-of-wedlock births occur to women over 18, and most young teen mothers already live with their parents. Moreover, it is quite likely that the teen's mother had once been an unmarried welfare mother herself, and was thus more a cause of the problem than its solution.
<p>
In attempting to conceal the policy vacuum on illegitimacy the Administration's press releases made bold proclamations about abstinence and teaching young people to delay sexual activity. But the bill itself mentioned neither marriage nor abstinence; instead it offered tired liberal nostrums: condom distribution, self-esteem building, values clarification, ``life skills training,'' etc. This was no surprise, since Donna Shalala abhorred abstinence education and had spent the prior year trying to abolish the government's single tiny abstinence program.
<p>
<FONT SIZE=+3>I</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>N</FONT> short, the 622-page ``end of welfare'' bill was nearly a carbon copy of the bogus reforms of 1988. It would have ``ended welfare'' by enlarging it.
<p>
For decades, the welfare state had rested uneasily on this sort of deception: the ability of liberal politicians to say one thing while doing another. As long as Democrats controlled Congress, Clinton could talk tough and still satisfy left-wing interest groups. Then came the 1994 election. After years of rhetorical philandering, Clinton suddenly faced a shotgun wedding with a Republican Congress eager to do the things Clinton only gabbed about. The House advanced legislation to establish work requirements and time limits, slow the automatic growth of welfare spending, reward states for cutting dependence, combat illegitimacy, and end the entitlement status of welfare. In the new political context, Clinton's bill was so liberal that Democrats never bothered to bring it to the floor of the House or Senate. Finally, the President himself disparaged his own legislation in an interview with Ben Wattenberg, a fitting end to a farce.
<p>
Clinton was now stretched in a three-way tug of war between his own rhetoric, the liberals who controlled most of his party and Administration, and the Republican Congress. The result was incoherence and a series of policy reversals, culminating, last winter, when Clinton supported the welfare-reform bill passed in the Senate and then vetoed virtually identical legislation a few weeks later, during the night of the record blizzard. After the veto, White House operatives sought to burnish the President's image as a reformer. Clinton, they claimed, had already fulfilled his pledge to end welfare by granting waivers to reform-minded governors (mostly Republican). Again the facts were otherwise: while Clinton had specifically promised to grant waivers for ideas he did not agree with, Secretary Shalala garrisoned HHS like Stalingrad; many conservative proposals were simply rejected, others greatly curtailed. Each conservative waiver had to be fought out clause by clause. California and Massachusetts simply rejected the modified waivers offered them.
<p>
The flip-flops continued. In May, in an effort to upstage Bob Dole, Clinton praised Governor Tommy Thompson's new reform plans, even though Wisconsin's initiative was several light years to the right of the legislation the President had vetoed four months earlier. Within 24 hours, White House spokesman Harold Ickes had indicated that the Administration had serious reservations about the Wisconsin waiver. Then came a reversal of the reversal, and another reversal, and so forth. But the substance of the debate continued to shift rightward. In July the White House backed the Castle - Tanner bill which ended the entitlement status of AFDC and copied many features of the legislation Clinton had vetoed in January. A lid was also put on the more extreme members of the Administration eager to prove ``scientifically'' that ending the entitlement status of welfare would yield millions of starving kids. Press spokesman Mike McCurry admitted that such studies (which had provided justification for the earlier veto) were sometimes ``a worthless exercise.''
<p>
At the end of July Congress passed a softened version of last year's legislation. Critically, Congress omitted Medicaid reforms to avoid a threatened veto. The President had apparently promised liberal groups he would ``save'' Medicaid; having kept his promise, he may have felt more free to reform AFDC, the least popular welfare program. After a debate within the White House, the President declared he would sign the bill. Although vacillating wildly on policy, Bill Clinton the politician has always grasped one simple idea: standing, sword in hand, as the final defender of the fortress of welfare is not a route to long-term popularity. And Bill Clinton does like to be liked.

 health-care plan proposed by the President and Mrs. Clinton demonstrated the scope of their project for socializing a major segment of the U.S. economy. In fact, Hillary Clinton revealed her statist philosophy during a speech in Washington in 1993 when she said, ``It's time to put the common good, the national interest, ahead of individuals.''
<P>
The liberal agenda wasn't just to make health care more affordable and accessible, but also to seduce the middle class into allegiance to the welfare state with a sweeping new entitlement. Fortunately, as Americans learned the details of the plan -- thanks to a network of fax machines, radio talk shows, the internet -- the majority of them saw through it.
<P>
The Clinton plan would have created at least 200 regional alliances, staffed by more than 50,000 bureaucrats, and added more than $70 billion to the federal budget deficit (according to the Congressional Budget Office's February 1994 estimate). The whole scheme would have been enforced with a plethora of fines, penalties, and jail terms for physicians and their patients. Voters registered their displeasure at the polls in November 1994.
<P>
The defeat of ClintonCare was a famous victory -- but an incomplete one. While Clinton-style health reform has receded into the shadows, no stake has been driven through its heart. During her visit to Estonia this July, the First Lady told reporters that government regulation of health care was needed and would happen eventually. Referring to the plan she had spearheaded two years earlier, she said, ``I think that basic model is still the right model.''
<P>
Ira Magaziner, the plan's principal architect, also yearns for vindication. This spring he told a meeting of the Hospital Association of Rhode Island that the American public still cries out for comprehensive reform, and added that President Clinton remains committed to the idea and will try again if a more receptive Congress is elected.
<P>
Having learned their lessons from the delays of the last round, liberal advocates expect to have a bill ready for speedy passage if Clinton is re-elected; their strategy is to strike before opponents have time to mount a campaign. Models currently being developed would begin with universal health coverage for all children, delivered through the structure of health-insurance purchasing cooperatives, government-defined benefits packages, and premium subsidies that characterized the original Clinton plan. The cynical calculation is that legislators would not dare vote against ``KidCare,'' and, once the foundation was in place, liberals could construct, brick by brick, the statist structure they originally envisioned.
<P>
This scenario could be dismissed as a paranoid nightmare -- except that Sen. Ted Kennedy (D., Mass.) has forthrightly claimed it as his strategy. He openly acknowledges that he views the insurance-regulation bill he is co-sponsoring with Sen. Nancy Kassebaum (R., Kan.) as a down-payment on a federally controlled health-care system. Experience in several states indicates that this attempt to expand access to health insurance would drive up costs, destabilize the market for private health insurance, and leave even more Americans without health insurance, leading to more and more legislation. Which Sen. Kennedy is more than happy to provide. He says, ``We're going to get this done, and we're going to keep coming back at it. . . . If we have a big sweep for Democrats in the House and Senate, we'll get single-payer.''
<P>
The current liberal strategy, in short, which Clinton would continue in a second term, is to offer ``security'' in exchange for incremental losses of freedom, seducing the middle class step by step into dependence.
<P>
Conservatives, meanwhile, have their own incremental strategy. By offering individuals more control over their health-care costs through devices such as medical savings accounts (MSAs), they expect that market incentives will restructure the medical industry from top to bottom, and prove so popular that more and more Americans will demand the savings, efficiency, and security of owning their own health-insurance policies.
<P>
Not surprisingly, the White House and Sen. Kennedy have led the charge against MSAs. Conservatives have fought for months to include MSAs in the Kassebaum - Kennedy bill, but Democratic intransigence and Republican pusillanimity have left MSAs so bound and gagged with restrictions that many conservatives think passage of the bill would do more harm than good.
<P>
Both sides understand that, as with a great battleship, a small shift in the heading can over time lead to a vastly different destination. The competing visions of where Americans should be headed could not be more starkly opposed: in one, health care becomes a state-provided entitlement; in the other, individual freedom and responsibility allow a properly functioning health-care marketplace to evolve. The combatants can be expected to fight to the last breath -- in the 1996 elections and beyond.

<FONT SIZE=+3>T</FONT><font size=+1>HE</font>  Clinton crime record is a centerpiece of the President's re-election campaign. And not surprisingly. After all, the Administration has had major legislative successes and has effectively controlled the policy debate.
<P>
Not that the victories have been cost-free. It was against the strong advice of then - Speaker Tom Foley and then - Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell that Clinton insisted on keeping the ``assault-weapon'' ban in the crime package. The decision may have had profound political effects. Several weeks after the 1994 elections, Clinton told the <I>Cleveland Plain-Dealer</I> that ``the fight for the assault-weapons ban cost 20 members their seats in Congress. . . . The NRA is the reason the Republicans control the House.''
<P>
In exchange, the President won a very small policy victory indeed. The banned guns look ugly, but they fire no faster than other guns, and generally use ammunition less powerful than do ordinary hunting rifles. According to gun-seizure statistics, they are almost never used in crime. Because the ban defines ``assault weapons'' in terms of cosmetic factors such as whether the barrel has a bayonet lug, gun manufacturers are currently selling nearly identical firearms, minus the offending bayonet lugs.
<P>
In placing form over substance, the gun ban perfectly illustrates the whole thrust of the Administration's crime policy. The much-vaunted funding for ``100,000 new cops on the street,'' for instance, actually provides funding for about 20,000 police and leaves localities stuck with the tab for the others. In a jurisdiction like Denver, the bill may add a half-dozen officers to a given shift -- hardly enough to make a real impact on crime control.
<P>
Similarly, the Administration's recently announced plan to trace guns illegally sold to juveniles was actually a long-standing program, trotted out as ``new'' for election purposes. And Clinton's current pet gun-control proposal, a ban on armor-piercing ammunition, was enacted by Congress in 1986. The proposal simply plays off media attention to an inventor's pipe dream about a new type of ammunition he said he was going to create.
<P>
Which isn't to say Clinton has had no impact. No President in American history has done more to promote electronic surveillance of the American people. The Federal Government is conducting wiretaps at record levels. The overwhelming majority of conversations tapped are innocent; of the guilty ones, most involve matters such as drugs and gambling; they are almost never used for bombing cases, the ostensible justification for the new grant of authority.
<P>
<font size=+3>N</font><font size=+1>O</font> President has been so consistently hostile to the separation between the Federal Government and the states. The Brady Act is an unfunded mandate on overburdened sheriffs and police chiefs to perform background checks on handgun buyers. Curfews, school uniforms, midnight basketball, automatically expelling students who bring guns or knives to school -- whether these policies are wise or unwise is debatable, but they have no business coming from Washington, D.C.
<P>
Centralization of law enforcement undermines accountability. As former Attorney General Edwin Meese put it, ``If voters are dissatisfied with their sheriff, district attorney, or local police force, they can vote the appropriate officials out of office.'' Federal agencies, in contrast, are several steps removed from democratic control. Local control also means fiscal responsibility: federal anti-crime spending tends to tilt heavily toward programs -- such as DARE and the McGruff crime dog -- that sound good on the Senate floor but are proven failures. And federal law enforcement's priorities are not on the crimes against persons and property that most concern Americans, but instead on statutory offenses: controlled substances, firearms, and the like.
<P>
To make matters of centralization worse, Louis Freeh is working to make the FBI a national police force (sending G-men to enforce child-support orders!) and indeed an international one, as it sets up overseas offices and develops close working relationships with the KGB's successor.
<P>
In terms of demagogy, Clinton's performance on crime issues is exceptional. After the Oklahoma City bombing, the Administration began pushing a list of greatly expanded powers for federal law-enforcement agencies -- despite the fact that not one provision in the bill could even arguably have prevented the bombing. Thanks to the Administration's ``anti-terrorism'' initiative, the Federal Government can now, without any need to show probable cause, order credit bureaus to disclose parts of consumer credit records, wiretap radio modem communications, and deport or imprison aliens on the basis of secret evidence. Clinton's original proposal was even worse: it would have greatly expanded the definition of ``terrorism,'' eviscerated restraints on use of the military in domestic law enforcement, and abolished requirements that federal law-enforcement agencies act only within their jurisdiction.
<P>
There is no reason to doubt that a second Clinton Administration would follow a crime policy much like the first: to go as far as politically possible in using crime control as a pretext for constricting privacy and increasing the power of the Federal Government. These policies will not reduce street crime, and they will leave Americans much more vulnerable to the types of crime our Founders most feared: the depredations of a lawless Federal Government.

<FONT SIZE=+3>A</FONT><font size=+1>S</font> a youth Bill Clinton rejected the segregation of his native South and embraced the series of federal laws that outlawed racial discrimination in public accommodations, education, employment, and voting. Clinton believed that racial discrimination was morally wrong, but his view was not simply a product of reason. To put the President's own hackneyed phrase to perhaps its best use, he ``felt the pain'' of segregation. Thus, while not a civil-rights activist, organizing and demonstrating, Clinton became a race healer. He made a point of associating with blacks, and continued to do so even when black separatism started gaining strength.
<P>
At the Yale Law School, according to David Maraniss's biography, <I>First in His Class</I>, a table in the cafeteria that black law students (including Lani Guinier) claimed as their own sometimes had a white visitor -- Bill Clinton. One reason so few whites sat at this ``black table of solidarity'' is that they didn't know how to ``enter that world.'' Maraniss reports that while at first some blacks stared at Clinton ``as though he was an unwanted interloper,'' he soon won them over through his willingness to ``talk about whatever the black students were talking about, or tell his own tales about life in Arkansas, or joke about how he had not gone to class or read any of his law books.''
<P>
Clinton continued this winning way. As a young law professor at the University of Arkansas, Clinton, writes Maraniss, ``quickly became the friend and champion'' of black students. His ``relaxed style'' was a comfort to blacks in the classroom, and outside it Clinton went the extra mile by tutoring them. The black students nicknamed Clinton ``Wonder Boy.'' Said one, ``It was a miracle the way he was.''
<P>
It has proved a miracle relevant to Clinton's political career. He has always been more than the ordinary Democrat who by virtue of being a Democrat gets most of the ``black vote.'' He has indeed been the Wonder Boy, a white figure who enjoys exceptional black trust. As a result, Clinton has been positioned to do extraordinary things. And since 1992, when he burst onto the national stage, he sometimes has done them.
<P>
In June of that year, Clinton repudiated rap singer Sister Souljah for her comment, in the wake of the Los Angeles riots, that ``if black people kill black people every day, why not have a week and kill white people? . . . why not kill a white person?'' Clinton said these remarks were ``filled with hatred'' and that ``if you took the words 'white' and 'black' and reversed them, you might think David Duke was giving that speech.'' Sister Souljah's remarks, Clinton added, contributed to a noxious political environment ``of pointing the finger at one another across racial lines.'' There was a strategic calculation in what Clinton did: seeking to demonstrate his willingness to challenge core Democratic constituency groups, the candidate made his comments about Sister Souljah in a speech to Jesse Jackson's Rainbow Coalition. But his criticism of her also served to define his ``new covenant'' message in a way consistent with the best principles in American life. Thus, the new covenant was not merely a statement that ``we (whatever color we are) are all in this together,'' as Clinton said elsewhere in 1992, but also a recognition that, all of us being together, there's no place among us for racism of any variety, white or black. Though Jackson defended Sister Souljah against Clinton, many black leaders, including some who had backed presidential runs by Jackson, said Clinton was right to say what he did.
<P>
In late 1993, Clinton gave a speech in Memphis to black pastors. The speech was remarkable for its focus on the cultural problems afflicting black communities -- a taboo subject for white politicians. Clinton was so confident that he could handle this subject and still retain the approval of blacks that he even dared to imagine what Martin Luther King might be saying today -- namely, that ``I did not live and die to see the American family destroyed. I did not live and die to see 13-year-old boys get automatic weapons and gun down 9-year-olds just for the kick of it. I did not live and die to see young people destroy their own lives with drugs and then build fortunes destroying the lives of others . . . I fought for freedom but not for the freedom of people to kill each other with reckless abandonment, not for the freedom of children to have children and the fathers of the children to walk away from them and abandon them, as if they don't amount to anything. . . . I fought to stop white people from being so filled with hate that they would wreak violence on black people. I did not fight for the right of black people to murder other black people with reckless abandonment.'' Clinton preached to the preachers that ``It is our moral duty to turn [this state of affairs] around,'' adding, ``We have to make our people whole again.''
<P>
<font size=+3>T</font><font size=+1>HE</font> use of the first-person plurals, ``our'' and ``we,'' made Clinton at one with his audience and the families they minister to. It was a dramatic demonstration of his solidarity with blacks. And it is this solidarity that has freed Clinton to endorse welfare reform, a project that could hit poor blacks harder than any other group. With the legislation of welfare reform, Clinton has now performed the Democratic equivalent of Richard Nixon's going to China.
<P>
There is not a chance, however, that Clinton will do the same with affirmative action. This, of course, was the great hope of New (and some old) Democrats. Early in 1993, the distinguished historian C. Vann Woodward wrote that Clinton ``rejects . . . racial preference'' and ``makes no separate case for the rights of racial minorities.'' Those have proved words to be eaten. Through 1994, the Clinton Administration was unable to find a racial preference it could not support, whether as a matter of policy or law, and in litigation (notably in the <I>Adarand</I> case and in voting-rights cases) it supported doctrine in effect making a separate case for the rights of minorities. But for the 1994 election results, which put affirmative action in the political dock, Clinton would not have felt compelled to review a single federal program containing preferences. Not that the Administration has greatly diverged from the left-lying affirmative action path it was on, although the press continues to report that Clinton has steered ``a middle course'' on affirmative action.
<P>
In his July 19, 1995, speech announcing the results of the Administration's review of affirmative action -- a speech given at the National Archives to an audience made up largely of civil-rights activists -- Clinton, wishing to ensure Jesse Jackson would not burden him with a primary challenge, announced his intention to ``mend, not end'' affirmative action. While the statement could be construed as a sign of progress -- to say that affirmative action needs ``mending'' is a concession that at least something about it is wrong -- there has over the past year been very little mending of affirmative action, and the only ending of an actual preferential device (two, by my count, have bit the dust) has occurred as a result of litigation. (See ``Don't Mend It, Defend It,'' by <a href="/nationalreview/clinton/therns.html">Abigail Thernstrom</a> .)
In practice, ``mending'' affirmative action has entailed the nurturing of a politics that, as the Democratic Leadership Council recognized in a statement critical of Clinton's policy conclusions, ``divides Americans most dramatically along racial lines,'' making it ``more rather than less difficult to transcend racial difference.'' According to Administration policy, found in policy papers, legal memos, and court filings, minorities need affirmative action, on the one hand, because non-minorities discriminate against them on account of race and, on the other, because their race and ethnicity are in themselves valuable commodities, providing ``diversity.'' Clinton's affirmative-action Presidency has left him unable to say with moral clarity why Louis Farrakhan, who has ascended into a position of black national leadership during the past four years, is wrong on matters of race.
<P>
Notwithstanding his 1992 admonition against pointing fingers across racial lines, Clinton has not been above doing that himself. In late 1993, campaigning in New York City for incumbent Mayor David Dinkins, he accused whites of being unwilling to vote for someone different from them, even though many whites had voted for Dinkins in 1989; in effect, he accused whites of racism. Two months ago, in a speech suggesting (against known evidence) that the black-church burnings were ``fires of [racial] hatred,'' Clinton warned against the raising of ``divisive'' issues during this election year. ``Every time you hear somebody use race or religion as an instrument of division and hatred, speak up against it.'' Subtly but unmistakably, Clinton suggested that anyone who questions affirmative action is using ``race as an instrument of division'' -- is a racist, in sum, no different from those who burn black churches. Republican timidity on the matter suggests that this effort to intimidate is succeeding.
<P>
On welfare Clinton may now be able to call himself a New Democrat. But on race he cannot say that. Instead, he has been aiding and abetting a politics of victimization and racial identity that threatens individual rights, denies the equal protection of the law, and divides the races. Wonder Boy, indeed.

<FONT SIZE=+3>O</FONT><font size=+1>N</font> July 19, 1995, Bill Clinton gave one of the most-watched speeches of his Presidency. With a live television audience tuned in from around the country, he pledged to maintain affirmative-action programs. But he also promised to reform those programs that did not meet the constitutional test laid out by the Supreme Court just a month earlier, in <I>Adarand Constructors</I> v. <I>Pena</I>. ``Mend it, don't end it,'' the President said of affirmative action.

``Defend it'' would have been a more forthright description of the Administration's response. As Deval Patrick, the assistant attorney general for civil rights, put it: ``It is important for us all not to be intimidated by <I>Adarand</I>. We have to take <I>Adarand</I> on.''
<P>
What the Supreme Court did in <I>Adarand</I> was to extend to federal programs its demand that race-based action meet the demanding test of narrow tailoring to serve a compelling state interest. Such programs would henceforth be subject to ``strict scrutiny,'' the highest level of judicial review.
<P>
Within three weeks of this decision the Administration had launched an all-out offensive to limit the Court-inflicted damage on its program of racial preferences. The first step was a June 28 Justice Department memo, written by Assistant Attorney General Walter Dellinger and intended to provide ``preliminary legal guidance'' to the general counsels of the executive agencies. The Dellinger memo was followed by a long-delayed White House review of federal affirmative-action programs that the President had ordered in February; written by Christopher Edley Jr. (special counsel to the President) and George Stephanopoulos, it promised ``a candid and balanced description'' of these programs, as well as a set of policy recommendations.
<P>
The Edley report was released the same day the President gave his ``Mend it, don't end it'' speech. Two months later, Deval Patrick testified before a House subcommittee on the proposed Equal Opportunity Act (the Dole - Canady bill), which had been introduced on the heels of the Edley review. And then on February 19, 1996, Associate Attorney General John R. Schmidt issued a directive spelling out the implications of <I>Adarand</I> for federal employment. That memo was supplemented by still another on May 22 entitled ``Proposed Reforms to Affirmative Action in Federal Procurement.''
<P>
The Administration had been hard at work. This was a fight from which the President could not run, he had said in a closed-door get-together with House Democrats on February 22, 1995. ``We have to outsmart the Republicans,'' he had declared -- and once five Supreme Court Justices had at least partially tied his hands with the <I>Adarand</I> ruling, his task included outsmarting the Court.
<P>
Only in retrospect was the Dellinger memo a hint of things to come; at the time, it read like a legitimate attempt to put the best face possible on <I>Adarand</I>, emphasizing the limits of the ruling and urging no precipitous action. But Dellinger's quick read of the decision was the Administration's last careful and lawyerly analysis. The Edley report, less than a month later, basically ignored the Supreme Court's holding. A brief on behalf of every federal affirmative-action program (the authors did not recommend eliminating a single one), it put the Administration on record as intending to carry bravely on.
<P>
As Edley and Stephanopoulos described them, these programs were above legal, political, or ethical reproach; the Court's concerns in <I>Adarand</I> and related decisions were thus woefully off base. The plurality in the Supreme Court's 1989 <I>Richmond</I> v. <I>Croson</I> decision had warned of the danger of ``stigmatic harm'' and ``racial hostility.'' Edley and Stephanopoulos spoke of policies that simply offered ``every American a fair chance to achieve success.'' They were a needed tool ``to move us away from a world of lingering biases . . . toward one in which opportunity is equal.'' The voice of these White House aides was, of course, precisely that of the President's. ``Affirmative action has been good for America,'' he said in his July 19 speech. ``When . . . done right, it is flexible, it is fair, and it works.''
<P>
The Clinton Administration clearly has had a mission: saving the whole panoply of racial preferences that pervades government employment and contracting. That was fully apparent in the Schmidt memos.
<P>
In the first of these memos, <I>Adarand</I> and related decisions are treated as minor annoyances -- roadblocks that require a bit of ingenuity to get around. Schmidt concludes: ``nothing in <I>Adarand</I> requires a retreat.'' What the decision demanded was ``a demonstrable factual predicate'' for an agency's race-conscious actions. Those actions could be justified by statistical evidence indicating minority underrepresentation (a ``lingering effect'' of historic discrimination) or perhaps by ``an agency's operational need for a diverse workforce.'' It encouraged agencies to increase minority participation through race-neutral means, but said that if these failed, then race-conscious means were acceptable.
<P>
<font size=+3>S</font><font size=+1>OME</font> background is needed to understand Schmidt's second memo, which is actually the more interesting of the two. In 1994, Congress had enacted the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act (FASA), which constituted a bipartisan effort to streamline federal purchases of goods and services, ranging from construction to paper clips. Included was a government-wide extension of two tools that had previously been available only to the Defense Department -- namely, the so-called ``rule of two'' and a bidding preference. The ``rule of two'' allowed the Pentagon to remove a contract from competitive bidding any time there were at least two minority businesses eager to do the work. The bidding preference allowed the Pentagon to award a contract to a minority-owned company as long as the cost was no more than 10 per cent above that of the lowest bidder.
<P>
FASA could not take effect until final implementing regulations were issued -- a process complicated by <I>Adarand</I>. Schmidt's second memo offered a ``model'' for these regulations.
<P>
Once again, the Clinton Administration made clear its commitment to the entire edifice of federal race-conscious programs. The title promised ``Proposed Reforms.'' And yet Schmidt himself said his starting ``premise'' was ``a need for affirmative action in procurement,'' and George Stephanopoulos agreed that ``we want to do everything we can to promote minority contracting.'' Moreover, the memo's stated aim was to create ``a structure for race-conscious procurement . . . in a manner that will survive constitutional scrutiny.''
<P>
The entire report, in fact, can be read as an exercise in deception. The government had an indisputably compelling interest (a Fourteenth Amendment demand) in ``affirmative remedial efforts,'' the memo stated at the outset. Discrimination is a given, remedies thus a necessity -- remedies that are ``affirmative.'' The only issue was whether they were sufficiently ``narrowly tailored'' to meet the second half of the constitutional standard.
<P>
The question of narrow tailoring was thus the memo's focus. And to that end, Schmidt proposed several alleged ``reforms.'' For instance, white firms should be able, with slightly more ease, to prove their eligibility for participation in programs that give small, disadvantaged businesses a break. On its face, a limited but good suggestion; a month earlier, however, the assistant attorney general for civil rights had (with refreshing candor) admitted he was ``not convinced that means anything in practical terms.''
<P>
Likewise, the memo suggested that the usual goals and timetables should be replaced by ``benchmarks'' that would establish the appropriate level of minority contracting in each industry. There would be no fixed, permanent 10 per cent goal for highway construction, in other words. But the benchmarks would be set by determining ``the level of minority contracting that one would reasonably expect to find in a market absent discrimination or its effects.'' In other words, by figuring out how many minority businesses would get what sort of contracts had history been different -- had discrimination never occurred.
<P>
There were two problems with this proposal. The first was the fact that such allegedly exact calculations were the stuff of pseudo-scientific dreams.  The second problem was Schmidt's assumption that a paucity of minority firms in a particular sector of the economy always indicated discrimination or its ``lingering effects.'' Together they meant that procurement officers would continue to set goals (in effect quotas) that seemed ``fair.'' And to meet those goals, as the memo acknowledged, the government could continue to use such race-conscious mechanisms as bidding credits and bonus points for prime contractors who used minority subcontractors for part of the work. There was more, none of which changed the bottom line: <I>Adarand</I>, as the Justice Department had interpreted it, had been a waste of the Supreme Court's breath.
<P>
Times have changed. Preferences cannot survive the court of public opinion. Raw racial exclusion has almost disappeared, and the majority of Americans have never, in any case, viewed discrimination as the remedy for discrimination.
<P>
Federal set-aside programs and federal coercion to ensure the use of minority-owned firms have never been more vulnerable. And yet the Clinton Justice Department is still intent on keeping them safe and sound. Unless the public wakes up to the Administration's unabashed defense of racial preferences, four more years of President Clinton are likely to mean four more years in which such preferences remain alive and very well.

<FONT SIZE=+3>A</FONT><font size=+1>T THE</font> beginning of the twentieth century, large numbers of immigrants from ethnic groups relatively new to the American melting pot entered the United States. American Presidents, Republicans and Democrats alike, agreed on two basic goals: teach the newcomers English and make them Americans. The clear aim was to strengthen our national identity -- to reinforce the <I>unum</I> in <I>E pluribus unum</I> -- by assimilating the new arrivals into American civilization.
<P>
As the twentieth century nears its end, large numbers of immigrants from ethnic groups relatively new to the American melting pot are, once again, entering the United States. Today, however, the American President, William Jefferson Clinton, promotes policies that are directly opposed to the strategies advocated by Theodore Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, and Woodrow Wilson. Instead of promoting Americanization and emphasizing the learning of English, the current occupant of the White House favors policies to weaken our national identity -- de facto anti-assimilation measures, anti-English-language initiatives, and an indifference to substantive citizenship training.
<P>
President Clinton and Education Secretary Riley tell us that their goal in supporting bi-lingual education is ``transitional.'' Schools should teach basic subjects in the children's ``primary language,'' so that they do not fall behind in math, science, history, and the like while they are learning English. Education professionals, however -- the people who actually run the schools -- strongly emphasize ``cultural preservation.'' Thus the Los Angeles Unified School District advises teachers ``not to encourage language-minority'' parents to speak English at home, but instead ``to encourage them to strongly promote development of the primary (non-English) language'' in their children. Current law buttresses the bi-lingual establishment by requiring that 75 per cent of all programs for newcomers be taught in the student's native language. This is at odds with proven principles of learning a second language, which is best done by writing and speaking it as much as possible, not simply by attending a one-hour class five days a week.
<P>
Even measured by its own criteria, bi-lingual education is a failure. It neither teaches English well, nor keeps students from falling behind in other subjects. A recent and comprehensive evaluation reported in the major research journal sponsored by the National Council of Teachers of English found that ``there is no body of research evidence to support the notion that non-English-speaking children will read, write, and do academic work in English better if they learn to read, write, and do academic work in their home language first.''
<P>
The dismal failure of bi-lingual education to teach children English has led to open revolts by Hispanic parents in New York, California, New Jersey, and Nebraska. In the Bushwick section of Brooklyn, 150 Latino parents organized to fight for English instruction for their children. Sister Kathy Maire, a Roman Catholic nun working with the parents, stated: ``The bottom line is these kids are being robbed of their futures.'' In Los Angeles some 100 Hispanic parents pulled their children out of a local school to protest bi-lingual education. Indeed, a U.S. Department of Education survey of Mexican- and Cuban-American parents revealed that four-fifths opposed teaching their children in Spanish, if this meant that less time would be devoted to English. Unfortunately, the education bureaucracy has a vested interest in keeping children in bi-lingual programs, because as the students ``transition out'' of native-language instruction, the schools lose government funds.
<P>
In this fight the Clinton Administration has from the beginning stood on the side of the bi-lingual establishment. Even before he was elected President, Bill Clinton, in an article in <I>Phi Delta Kappan</I> (October 1992), blasted the Bush Administration for not spending enough money on bi-lingual education. Once in power the Clintonites have not simply advocated more money for existing bi-lingual programs; they have expanded multi-lingual education. For example, the Administration's major education bill, the Improving America's Schools Act of 1994, authorized federal funds to develop written grammars for previously oral American Indian and Native Alaskan languages. Thus instead of merely ``preserving'' primary languages, bi-lingual education under Clinton may include inventing what are essentially new written languages.
<P>
For the first time, the congressionally mandated National Assessment for Educational Progress (NAEP), the ``Nation's Report Card,'' will be given in Spanish as well as in English. Deputy Education Secretary Madelein Kunin sent a memorandum to the civil servant in charge of the tests stating that ``excluding'' children whose English is limited violated the Civil Rights Act and ordering that these students be accommodated by providing them with Spanish versions of the math and science tests. The irony in giving the tests for the ``Nation's Report Card'' to American students in a language other than English appears to have gone unnoticed by either the Clinton Administration or the Republican Congress, which has remained mute on this issue. As Jorge Amselle of the Center for Equal Opportunity put it, ``If [the students] ace a history test in Spanish and flunk it in English, it's not going to do them any good when they go to get a job.''
<P>
Although Bill Clinton signed an official-English bill when he was governor of Arkansas, the Clinton Administration has opposed efforts by Republicans and by moderate and conservative Democrats in the 104th Congress to declare English the official language of the United States. The Administration also opposes congressional efforts to stop requiring states to provide ballots in other languages as discrimination against Americans who don't speak English.
<P>
Syndicated columnist Georgie Anne Geyer, in a brilliant new book, <I>Americans No More: The Death of Citizenship</I> (to be published by Atlantic Monthly Press next month), chronicles in painful detail the steady diminution of naturalization -- the once meaningful process of immigrants' becoming American citizens. While the ``dumbing down'' of citizenship did not begin on January 20, 1993, it has clearly accelerated under the Clinton Administration. In December 1995 the Administration expanded the use of foreign languages on citizenship tests; four hundred new centers give the test in Spanish. Plans are under way to offer tests in Korean, Vietnamese, and Tagalog.
<P>
<font size=+3>T</font><font size=+1>HE</font> attitude toward the importance of English for American citizenship is reflected in the comments of Jess Nieto, a director of one of the ``community organizations'' authorized by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to give citizenship tests. Nieto declared, ``Many of these people [resident aliens applying for citizenship] have been here a million years. Why should they have to take the test in English?''
<P>
The citizenship tests themselves have been stripped of much of the rich historical, civic, and patriotic content that once made studying for and passing the test a truly gratifying experience in the life of a new American citizen. Even the dignified and moving court ceremony for swearing in new immigrants is no longer mandatory. Besides the INS, over eight hundred organizations are now eligible to give citizenship tests. Leftist advocacy groups such as the Asylum and Refugee Rights Project, Washington Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights under the Law, and the Mexican - American Legal Defense and Educational Fund are working closely with the INS. Ironically, activist lawyers who spend their working hours litigating against any legal distinctions between citizens and non-citizens are often running the official process that makes resident aliens American citizens. Even the Heritage of Aztlan Educational and Cultural Foundation -- a group which romanticizes irredentist Mexican claims to the ``lost territories'' of the Southwestern United States -- is busy giving tests in American history and civics to candidates for American citizenship.
<P>
<font size=+3>M</font><font size=+1>EANWHILE</font>, the Clinton Administration has begun a project of instant mass naturalization, Citizenship USA. Hundreds of federal workers from other agencies have been detailed to the INS to process citizenship applications. In one case in California, special personnel worked from dawn to dusk for two months and naturalized sixty thousand resident aliens. According to an article by Ruth Larson in the <I>Washington Times</I>, a career INS official stated that a White House staffer admitted to him, ``Quite frankly, it's 250,000 registered voters who are likely to vote Democratic.''
<P>
Attitudes about citizenship and American identity are revealed in the words and actions of Clinton appointees. For example, Eugene Garcia, Clinton's bi-lingual-education chief from 1993 to 1995, told a conference of bi-lingual educators, ``The border for many is nonexistent. For me, for intellectual reasons, that border shall be nonexistent.'' INS Commissioner Doris Meissner has suggested that the inspiring Oath of Allegiance, in which new citizens promise to ``absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or sovereignty, . . . support and defend the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic; . . . bear arms on behalf of the United States; . . . take this obligation freely without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion: so help me God,'' is ``anachronistic'' and should be changed.
<P>
One of Mrs. Meissner's top political appointees, Executive Associate Commissioner Robert Bach, was the principal author of a Ford Foundation report on immigrant communities in 1993. Bach recommended that non-citizens be permitted, indeed ``encouraged,'' to vote in city and school-board elections. In fact, the terms ``citizen'' and ``citizenship'' are rarely mentioned in the report; instead Bach uses the term ``established resident.'' He is critical of assimilation, suggests that too much ``homogeneity'' may be ``the problem in America,'' and emphasizes that long-established residents should ``accommodate'' the newcomers with multi-lingualism instead of assimilating them into mainstream society. Another of Mrs. Meissner's chief lieutenants, Alexander Alienikoff, has, according to Georgie Anne Geyer, ``argued constantly that it was time no longer to distinguish or differentiate between citizens and legal aliens.''
<P>
The Clinton Administration has unleashed the coercive power of federal agencies  against opponents of its anti-assimilation and multi-lingual policies. Thus on February 24, 1995, after the city council of Allentown, Pennsylvania, voted 6 to 1 to declare English the official language of their city, the city clerk received a call from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) warning him that Allentown could lose federal funds if the city council did not repeal the ordinance. A Clinton appointee, Assistant Secretary Roberta Achtenberg, launched an investigation and suggested that the city's ordinance might violate Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. Twenty-three Congressmen sent a letter to HUD Secretary Henry Cisneros demanding an explanation. Finally, after the city government promised not to implement the ordinance, the inquiry was canceled.
<P>
<font size=+3>I</font><font size=+1>N</font> August 1995, the chairman of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission, Clinton appointee Mary Frances Berry, subpoenaed members of the Florida-187 Committee to appear before a Commission hearing on ``racism.'' Mrs. Berry demanded that the group -- which supports a Florida initiative patterned after California's attempt to deny most public benefits to illegal aliens -- turn over all its computer printouts, reports, policy studies, memoranda, and internal documents. JoAnn Peart, a housewife from Delray Beach, one of the individuals subpoenaed, contacted Republican Congressman Mark Foley, who asked the Subcommittee on the Constitution to hold oversight hearings on the Civil Rights Commission's action. A group of Republican congressmen sent a letter to President Clinton stating that the Commission's action was a ``clear violation'' of citizens' ``right to engage in political activities without being intimidated or harassed by a government entity.'' Shortly after this uproar Mary Frances Berry withdrew the subpoenas.
<P>
For the past several decades Americans have had a continuing argument over two visions of the future, an argument that will determine the fate of our national identity. Do we promote English or multi-lingualism? Do we strengthen American citizenship or do we diminish it? Should we be a multi-ethnic nation or a multi-cultural one? A multi-ethnic nation means an America composed of individual citizens belonging to racial and ethnic groups from all over the world. On the other hand, a multi-cultural nation emphasizes group identity, not individual citizenship. It establishes different legal and language ``rights'' for different racial and ethnic groups, rejects assimilation, and erases distinctions between citizens and non-citizens.
<P>
There is no doubt that the Clinton Administration has joined the battle on the side of multi-lingualism and multiculturalism. The words and deeds of Clintonites Achtenberg, Aleinikoff, Bach, Berry, Cisneros, Garcia, Kunin, and Meissner are clear and consistent: expand official multi-lingualism wherever possible; water down the substantive meaning of citizenship; blur distinctions between citizens and non-citizens; advocate voting by non-citizens; and use Federal Government power to harass opponents of these policies.
<P>
Recently, Congress has started to challenge the Administration. House Appropriations Committee Chairman Bob Livingston (R., La.) succeeded in cutting bi-lingual education. Congressmen Toby Roth (R., Wisc.), Randy Cunningham (R., Calif.), and John Porter (R., Ill.) and Senator Richard Shelby (R., Ala.) have introduced legislation strengthening the use of English. On August 1, a bill making English the official language of the U.S. and allowing states to eliminate multilingual ballots passed the House. Despite these efforts, the multi-lingual/multi-cultural infrastructure will remain intact. For example, Congressman Roth's initiative to eliminate bi-lingual education is stalled in the House, and the Senate will almost certainly restore multi-lingual ballots when it votes on ``official English'' in September. If the bill passes, a veto is expected. Most importantly, a serious and sustained intellectual and moral argument against the continuing assault on American national identity has not yet been heard. In the final analysis, the struggle between multi-ethnic America and multi-cultural America will be won by the side that is able to articulate an intellectual and moral argument that resonates with the American people.
<P>
The Clinton Administration and their multi-lingualist allies have not made a compelling case for their radical new vision of America, but they have largely succeeded in scaring off and intimidating potential opposition. Their strategy is name calling -- denounce opponents of official multi-lingualism as ``mean-spirited,'' ``racists,'' and ``bigots.'' Thus the American Civil Liberties Union characterizes opposition to official multi-lingualism in terms of ``hate mongering'' and ``fostering bigotry and intolerance.''
<P>
No wonder opponents of official multi-lingualism have been hesitant to make this a major issue, knowing they will be vilified as ``racists'' and ``bigots.'' My guess, however, is that the great silent majority of Americans from all ethnic and racial backgrounds is waiting -- indeed hungering -- to hear the voice of multi-ethnic America challenge the multi-lingual/multi-cultural forces and dislodge them from the moral high ground.
<P>
This voice of multi-ethnic America would tell us: We the People of the United States, a self-governing and free people, have a moral right to transmit our way of life and our national heritage to future generations of Americans. Fluency in English is essential for full participation in our society. To tell newcomers to America otherwise is to lie to them. To be an American citizen is a privilege, not a right. To cheapen citizenship and blur the boundaries between citizens and non-citizens is to mock the sacrifices that have sustained our nation for more than two hundred years. If we don't take citizenship seriously we don't take our constitutional democracy seriously.
<P>
Therefore, we should establish English as our official language, eliminate bi-lingual education and multi-lingual ballots, and end the corruption of our naturalization process. Moreover, as people on both sides of the immigration debate -- including Linda Chavez, John Miller, Dan Stein, and the late Barbara Jordan -- have suggested, it is time to launch a new civic integration effort, similar to the Americanization initiatives earlier this century. Nothing could be more welcoming and inclusive than fostering English and teaching the responsibilities of citizenship to newcomers. Those of us whose parents or grandparents came through Ellis Island at the turn of the century are particularly grateful that Presidents Roosevelt, Taft, and Wilson advocated Americanization, instead of multi-lingualism and multi-culturalism.
<P>
Opposition to official multi-lingualism does not mean that Americans should not learn foreign languages, or that we are not free to speak whatever language we want, or that languages other than English cannot be used in places such as courts and hospitals. It does not mean ``English only.'' It means that English should be the <I>official</I> language of <I>public</I> business in our liberal democracy.
<P>
Yes, as with people everywhere, there is bigotry among us. However, the genius of America is that we have worked to overcome unfair discrimination and irrational prejudice. To make the learning of English a priority and to strengthen the substance of citizenship does not mean we are ``racists'' and ``bigots'' -- it means that we take our national heritage and our democracy seriously.
<P>
It is the advocates of bi-lingual education who have prevented Latino kids from advancing. It is a patronizing establishment that is stealing their keys to the American dream.
<P>
The position advanced by the multicultural establishment amounts to a bluff. It is at odds with the feelings and instincts both of the American majority and of the minorities that these policies are allegedly designed to help. What is needed is an open discussion of the facts and values in question. Once that happens, the bluff will be called and the great American public will demand that we end official multi-lingualism, eliminate bi-lingual education and foreign language ballots, take naturalization seriously, and, in the spirit of Teddy Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, and Woodrow Wilson, launch a new campaign for Americanization and civic integration.

<FONT SIZE=+3>I</FONT><font size=+1>S THIS</font> country to remain the United States of America, pursuing the course of success as charted by the Founders, or are we resigned to watch a different type of country emerge in its place? That is the question Bob Dole should be asking his fellow citizens.
<P>
The spectacle of someone like me, an immigrant, who is also a recent arrival on the political scene, offering advice to America's senior professional politician is one of concern to me. No doubt, after nearly fifty years as a professional pianist, I would be startled if someone who apparently began lessons just a few years ago proposed a different way of playing. But then, my ``lessons'' in politics began at the age of eight, when German troops occupied Budapest.
<P>
It is, thus, of even greater concern to me that the Dole campaign -- the means by which to forestall the alteration-beyond-recognition of this miracle called America -- appears glued to the bottom of a hole in the ground. The other side continues to set the agenda; we remain on the defensive.
<p>
It is in this moment of despair that I request your attention, Senator Dole. One might think: A look at you, a look at the alternative would be sufficient to get you about 85 per cent of the popular vote. Alas, it is not sufficient. What the campaign needs is a different perspective. The time for traditional strategies which secure the Irish vote, the Jewish vote, the union vote, the senior-citizen vote, the black vote, the Southern vote, the women's vote, has passed. The time has come to seek the <I>American</I> vote.
<P>
Notwithstanding thirty years of concerted effort by the other side to subdivide us into irreconcilable groups, most of us still believe that we are, first and last, Americans.
<P>
It is easy to overlook the simple and obvious, precisely because you, Senator Dole, ``hold these truths to be self-evident.'' But people in Seattle and San Francisco, in San Antonio and Fort Myers, in Topeka, New London, St. Joseph -- even in Washington, D.C. -- would love to be reminded by you that this nation was founded on a set of principles which reflect the most thoughtful deliberation on the human condition ever undertaken. Talk to them about the thousands of years it had taken to establish equality before the law for every individual, now threatened by the ever-increasing demand for group rights; they need to realize that <I>group rights signal the end of individual rights</I>. Explain that one cannot ``almost'' guarantee private property, that its sanctity is the cornerstone of all civilization. They know the strength of your sentiments about judges who legislate from the bench; add to this the reminder that separation of powers -- not permitting the same people to make, interpret, and enforce the law -- is the fragile membrane protecting us from dictatorship. You might add, too, that you agree with the Founders, who envisioned no role in education for the Federal Government but who most certainly charged it with responsibility for the common defense.
<P>
Americans would love to hear you say that you will move to dismantle those regulatory and judicial straitjackets which are choking tolerance and voluntarism. Above all, reassure them that people who say ``In God we trust'' are echoing, not violating, the Founders' intent.
<P>
The language the Founders spoke was English; their deeply held beliefs came from the Old and New Testaments. Yet they benefited not only those whom the Founders represented but, in uncommon measure, those who arrived later, speaking different languages and desiring the freedom to live by their different beliefs. Above all, they bestowed upon their posterity the incomparable blessings of a polity in which the peaceful transition of power is the norm.
<P>
The other side will point to its standardized list of grievances aimed at the Founders. You might remind them that the founding principles were but a road map to guide us toward an ever-improving future. The map was based largely on the English legacy, which -- like all others -- was stained with blood. But unlike all others, it was from the start striving for a justice which cannot be bought or sold; for freedom on the high seas and in people's minds; for decency in human conduct and for honorable compromise in place of strife. We ought to continue speaking the language of this legacy. English has given us the word <I>fairness</I>. No other language has yet come up with even a translation of this word.
<P>
Americans may know, but will be glad to hear you say, where your ideas have originated. This would also create an opportunity to discuss where the other side obtained its. By ``other side'' I do not mean true Democrats: indeed, many of <I>them</I> might seize the moment to reaffirm their American foundations. No: I refer to those whose ideas clearly derive from the opposing doctrine.
<P>
This doctrine has worn many labels -- Fascism, Bolshevism, National Socialism, Communism, Trotskyism, Social Democracy, Maoism, and present-day so-called Liberalism -- but all stand for some variation of socialist philosophy. The practices were developed in the Vladimir Ilyich Lenin School for Behavior Control, priding itself in such stellar graduates as Hitler and Stalin.
<P>
Nothing even remotely comparable in violence is contemplated by latter-day disciples: the current approach is low-key, sophisticated. Your recent encounter with tobacco, Senator, was a measure of its success. Tobacco, of course, has long been selected for an experiment in incremental behavior control. The process begins with an eminently reasonable suggestion, such as setting aside a few tables in restaurants, a few rows in airplanes. No one could possibly object. Semi-scientific ``evidence'' follows and selective name-calling commences. A <I>crescendo</I> is generated in the public discourse, leading to public hysteria, as the selected target is declared the dragon to be slain at all cost. As with every other item on the agenda, we are never told where the campaign intends to end. We sit in Edgar Allan Poe's cell, helplessly watching as the four walls and the ceiling close in on us.
<P>
By now, the targets, methods, and slogans of the other side have achieved such perfection (they <I>appear</I> so reasonable, compassionate, equitable) that exposing their true origins, along with the destruction that invariably follows in their wake, is the only way for our side to win. Lead us on to a winning course, Senator Dole. If they say, ``Character does not matter -- issues matter,'' tell them that <I>principles</I> matter even more. Serve notice that henceforth issues will be discussed first as they relate to our founding principles. Thus, the issue is not affirmative action, but equality before the law; not cutting off immigration, but inviting only those whose desire to become American; not the level of funding for Goals 2000, but restating where government has, and where it has not, a role to perform. Take the lead, and watch candidates -- and voters -- line up behind you.

<FONT SIZE=+3>I</FONT><font size=+1>MMIGRATION</font>  experts generally agree that the Clinton Administration has devoted  more attention to immigration than either of its two Republican predecessors. Mr. Clinton's policies, however, tend to be reactive, and he always has at least two reactions: his initial public statement (determined largely by public-opinion polls, which show support for restrictions), and then the actual policy (as determined by his advisors and the various special interests they represent).
<P>
Let's begin with a look at Clinton's record on illegal immigration, since that is a major focus of his re-election campaign, particularly in California, a must-win state. Less than three months after taking office Clinton sent to Congress his Fiscal Year 1994 budget proposal for the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which included cutting 93 Border Patrol positions. Four months later, Clinton responded to pressure from California Democrats Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein (who was gearing up for re-election) by giving a speech in which he proclaimed that ``our borders leak like a sieve'' and urged that $45.1 million be spent to beef up the Border Patrol, including six hundred new agents. He failed to mention that the House had already approved an additional $60 million for the Border Patrol, or that the Senate Appropriations Committee had approved an additional $45 million.
<P>
In September 1993, the Border Patrol chief in El Paso, Silvestre Reyes, proved, on his own initiative, that illegal immigration could be reduced by up to 75 per cent, without a massive increase in money or personnel, by focusing on deterrence instead of apprehension. The Administration, apparently incensed that an employee would dare to be innovative without prior approval, ostracized Reyes and dismissed his hugely successful strategy as unworkable in other border areas. During the next few months, because of California's Proposition 187, Sen. Feinstein's neck-and-neck race with Republican challenger Michael Huffington, and Democrat Kathleen Brown's floundering bid to unseat Gov. Pete Wilson, the Administration was motivated to come up with its own plan to curb illegal immigration in San Diego. Thus, on October 1, 1994, Attorney General Janet Reno unveiled the multi-million-dollar Operation Gatekeeper, heralded as an El Paso-type deterrence strategy, but actually more like the old (and unsuccessful) cat-and-mouse apprehension strategy.
<P>
Clinton repeatedly holds up Operation Gatekeeper as proof that he is more serious than Republicans about controlling illegal immigration. Border Patrol statistics, however, show that the number of illegal aliens apprehended in San Diego actually <I>increased</I> in all but three months of the first year and a half of Gatekeeper, rather than declining by the 70 per cent or so that Administration officials had promised.
<P>
These statistics presented something of a problem for the Administration until April 1996, when apprehensions in San Diego suddenly began to plummet. Two months later, the Administration was facing allegations that Border Patrol officials were falsifying arrest records to get the numbers down.
<P>
The Clinton Administration's record on political asylum is similar. During his first presidential campaign, Clinton berated George Bush for the latter's policy of returning Haitian boat people to Haiti for asylum interviews. Clinton pledged to provide a safe haven for the fleeing Haitians. Soon after the election, however, media reports that Haitians were building large numbers of boats to take advantage of his generosity spurred an angry public reaction. He immediately announced that he would maintain the Bush policy. This was only the first of many Clinton flip-flops on Haiti.
<P>
And then came the Cuban rafters. First, Clinton directed that their asylum claims be screened on board the Coast Guard ships that picked them up. When the ships filled up, Clinton directed that the Cubans be diverted to Guantanamo for asylum interviews. When Guantanamo began to fill up, with no end in sight, Clinton made a deal with Fidel Castro: the United States would admit a <I>minimum</I> of twenty thousand Cuban immigrants each year if Castro would agree to halt the outflow of rafters. Attorney General Reno announced that no Cubans would be admitted to the United States directly from Guantanamo (this was supposed to entice them to leave Guantanamo and return home voluntarily). The vast majority of Guantanamo Cubans are now settled in Miami -- after being transported directly from Guantanamo.
<P>
Seven months into his term, Clinton proposed legislation that included expedited exclusion for frivolous asylum claimants, an increase in INS asylum personnel, and various anti-smuggling provisions. But it didn't take long for the President to succumb to pressure from immigrant-advocacy, refugee-rights, and lawyers' groups and abandon the legislative package in favor of a watered-down package of administrative reforms that would have had little impact except for a provision that decouples the work permit from the asylum-application process.
<P>
For most of the past four years, the Administration has spoken about the need to reform the asylum system and reduce fraudulent applications. In most cases these statements have come in reaction to the latest crisis: Haiti, Cuba, the World Trade Center bombing, the <I>Golden Venture</I> incident (Clinton promised that the Chinese arriving on that ship would be swiftly deported, but many still are languishing in U.S. jails). But all the while, it has been broadening the asylum system to advance its social agenda. Under U.S. law, asylum is for people facing <I>state-sponsored political persecution</I>, but we now grant asylum, for example, to women facing genital mutilation. The latest Administration proposal reportedly is to grant asylum to aliens who are HIV positive (even though such aliens are not legally permitted to immigrate to this country).
<P>
Finally, there is President Clinton's record on legal immigration. In June 1995, the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform, chaired by the late Barbara Jordan, recommended a modest cut in legal immigration and the elimination of some extended-family immigration categories. President Clinton immediately endorsed the recommendations as ``consistent with my own views'' and added that they ``are pro-family, pro-work, pro-naturalization.'' Both Rep. Lamar Smith (R., Tex.) and Sen. Alan Simpson (R., Wyo.) modeled their immigration bills on the Commission's recommendations, believing logically enough that they would encounter little resistance after Clinton's enthusiastic endorsement.
<P>
Unfortunately, Barbara Jordan died before the Smith and Simpson bills reached the floor, allowing Clinton to renege on his endorsement without risking a Jordan tongue-lashing (one Commission staffer told me he's glad he's not the one who will have to explain Clinton's reversal to Miss Jordan on the other side of the Pearly Gates). So, during the Senate Judiciary Committee markup of the Simpson bill, Attorney General Reno and INS Commissioner Meissner personally lobbied senators to support an amendment by Sen. Spencer Abraham (R., Mich.) to split the legislation into one bill on illegal immigration and one on legal, thus effectively killing any chance for legal-immigration reform in the Senate. Two days before the final House vote on the Smith bill, President Clinton sealed the fate of legal-immigration reform by announcing his support for an amendment by Reps. Dick Chrysler (R., Mich.), Howard Berman (D., Calif.), and Sam Brownback (R., Kan.) to eliminate from the bill the reductions in legal immigration.
<P>
In sum, the Clinton Administration has rejected the one proven strategy for controlling illegal immigration, broadened the grounds for asylum, and killed legal-immigration reform.
<P>
(One final note: If you did not find your favorite Clinton immigration flip-flop here, I apologize -- the list was so long I had to pick and choose.)

<FONT SIZE=+3>M</FONT><font size=+1>ORE</font> than a thousand people have died and millions have had to flee their homes, the wires have reported, during recent flooding of the Yangtze River. By historic standards this is a modest flood. Tens of thousands drown every few years in Yangtze floods, and there have been cases when millions died from the uncontrolled waters of China's largest river spilling its banks.
<P>
Lord knows the Communist dynasty ruling in Peking has many crimes to account for, but attempting to tame the waters of the Yangtze to save its citizens from those deadly floods surely does not rank among them. Yet the Clinton Administration has given extraordinarily high priority to sabotaging the financing of the Three Gorges Dam, China's $12-billion effort to control the floods. To save fresh-water dolphins, Siberian cranes, and picturesque rugged scenery, the Administration has worked assiduously to stop the project. Samuel Berger, deputy National Security Advisor, intervened with the supposedly independent Ex-Im Bank to stop commercial credits for it. As a result, Caterpillar and other U.S. companies seeking to sell equipment in competition with Japanese and European manufacturers have been handicapped, and the cost of building the dam increased. Behind the scenes the Administration also threatened to use its veto power at the World Bank and other international agencies to prevent them from lending money for the Three Gorges project.
<P>
Now, there may be legitimate criticisms of the design of the Three Gorges dam. It may be Stalinist gargantuism. Maybe a design with several smaller dams would have been better? Maybe the scenery and endangered species could have been accommodated to a  greater degree, while still providing flood control and electricity? Such questioning of detail would be one thing. But the U.S. position under the Clinton Administration has been one of outright hostility to the aims of the Yangtze project, reflecting a humanity-hating environmentalism that dwells on possible dangers to birds and fish while cavalierly disregarding the needs of tens of millions of people. This extreme brand of environmentalism pervades the Clinton Administration.
<P>
Indeed, its ``integrating'' this environmentalism into all aspects of government has been a major internal goal of the Clinton Administration. In foreign policy, for example, this has meant creating a new under-secretary position for environmental affairs at the Department of State, a position given to Green ex-Senator Timothy Wirth; designating a senior officer at each embassy as ``environmental point person''; and identifying environmentalist doctrine as part of the United States vital interests. A memorandum from Secretary of State Warren Christopher dated February 14 to all embassies and bureaus of the State Department said that ``environmental concerns'' will henceforth be a key component of U.S. foreign policy. Environmental issues are to be ``integrated'' into ``bureau and mission program plans,'' into ``trip plans,'' and into ``talking points for bilateral meetings involving the President and other senior officials.'' In short, every U.S. official is under orders to become an environmentalist scold.
<P>
One hopes that the vast majority of U.S. officials will just go through the motions, generating the usual statements about recycling, energy conservation, ozone-layer protection, dolphin protection, and suchlike, and inserting them into their memoranda. But there has been a steady entrenchment of this stuff even as the bits and pieces of science underpinning it are demonstrated to be junk.
<P>
<font size=+3>T</font><font size=+1>AKE</font> that mother of all scares, global warming. Simply put, there isn't any global warming. It isn't happening, according to the most sophisticated temperature measurement by balloon and satellite. There's a lot of theory and many fancy computer modelings about why it should be happening. But it just isn't there on the thermometers.
<P>
So now we have parts of the Clinton Administration engaging in Statistical Fraud 101. Any time series of a phenomenon like average temperature by year will bump up and down, and elementary junk science yields a handy means of ``proving'' an upward trend. Search a series for a couple of low years and start off with those; then cut off your trend line when you've got a couple of high years. The global-warming junkmeisters at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory just last month did that in an article in Nature magazine using temperature data from 1963 to 1987. Given that 1964 was extraordinarily cold and 1987 very hot, these cheerleaders for Al Gore produced a good-looking uptrend.
<P>
Of course when you include the data from a few years before 1963 and the years since 1987 -- as Patrick Michaels, a University of Virginia climatologist, quickly did -- you get what every reputable calculation of the thermometer data shows, which is that there is no up-trend.
<P>
More recently, the Administration made a major shift leftward to embrace a canon of environmentalist fundamentalism that it had previously found too hot politically -- mandatory limits on emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Green Czar Timothy Wirth announced a new U.S. policy of mandatory limits on carbon-dioxide emissions at a press conference in Geneva July 16 saying the United States was proposing a ``radical'' international accord: ``What we want is a binding target for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions that is agreed on internationally.'' This radical approach has never been the subject of any reasoned Administration statement or testimony, let alone the subject of major study by a serious scientific panel. Indeed, a National Academy of Sciences (NAS) study a couple of years ago said that if global warming does occur humanity can adapt, since the computer-forecast changes in climate are similar in magnitude to natural changes. But the Administration is going by green-faith, and science is useful to it only insofar as it supports that faith.
<P>
By pushing an international accord on suppressing greenhouse gases, evangelists of environmentalism such as Mr. Wirth are able to take the huge issues of constraining our power stations and industries out of domestic policy forums. If the accord is agreed to in Geneva, then it gains international legitimacy and opponents at home are disparaged as ``flying in the face of world opinion and advocating that we flout international law.''
<P>
At the same time that users of the carbon fuels of coal, oil, and gas are under pressure from the threatened mandatory international controls driven by the warming scare, the nuclear-power industry is not being allowed to dispose of its wastes. The Clinton Department of Energy, under environmentalist influence, is stalling on the opening of the Yucca Mountain high-level nuclear-waste repository in Nevada with years' more studies of possible seismic and other dangers. What was supposed to open in 1998 now cannot open before 2010, the Administration says.
<P>
Nuclear power plants have such a good safety record in operation that their opponents rely on hypothetical problems of waste disposal to stop new plants and to get existing ones closed. And so high-level wastes are accumulating onsite year by year at a hundred nuclear plants around the country because the Administration won't open the long-term repository that has been built in Nevada.
<P>
Meanwhile the green assault on synthetic chemicals is being pushed within the Environmental Protection Agency in a bold move to dispense with a hitherto unchallenged part of science -- the EPA proposes to simply omit from it as cancer-test guidelines the test of statistical significance -- the classic scientific tool for measuring the possibility that study results reflect chance rather than a regular association. As the newsletter <I>EPA WATCH</I> reported: ``Reducing the role of statistical significance or eliminating it altogether, could open the door for EPA to drastically expand the number of substances subject to environmental regulation.'' The newsletter might have added: and allow the EPA to regulate in an even more arbitrary fashion than now -- at home and abroad.

<FONT SIZE=+3>I</FONT><font size=+1>N 1992</font>, the economy grew by 2.7 per cent. Candidate Bill Clinton described that as ``the worst economic performance in fifty years.'' In 1995 the economy grew by around 2 per cent. Yet in this January's State of the Union message, the President said the economy is ``the healthiest in thirty years.'' So on which, if either, occasion was Bill Clinton telling the truth?
<P>
By every conceivable measure of income, output, or productivity, the economy has performed poorly on Clinton's watch, particularly in comparison with what Bob Bartley dubbed ``the seven fat years'' of 1983 to 1989.
<P>
<b>Gross domestic product:</b> Real GDP, the most comprehensive measure of the economy's output, grew by only 2.3 per cent a year in 1993 - 95, down from 3.9 per cent in 1983 - 89.
<P>
<b>Productivity:</b> Growth of output per hour in the non-farm business sector averaged only 0.5 per cent a year in 1993 - 95, down from 1.6 per cent in 1983 - 89. Labor Department figures on ``multifactor productivity'' show the ratio of capital to labor falling in 1993 - 94, which inevitably slows the growth of productivity, real wages, and family incomes.
<P>
<b>Real disposable income:</b> After-tax personal income rose by only 2.3 per cent a year in 1993 - 95, down from 3.5 per cent in 1983 - 89.
Real labor compensation: Real hourly wages and benefits rose by 7 per cent in 1981 - 88, but were virtually flat from 1988 to 1995.
<P>
<b>Employment:</b> As measured by the household survey, employment grew by only 1.9 per cent a year in 1993 - 95, down from 2.4 per cent in 1983 - 89. Measured by an alternative survey of business (which may count the same workers twice), payroll employment grew by 2.6 per cent a year in 1993 - 95, but that too was down from 3 per cent in 1983 - 89.
<P>
<b>Labor force:</b> The supply of new workers slowed to 0.8 per cent a year in 1993 - 95, down from 1.8 per cent in 1983 - 89. Demographics can't begin to explain this huge and sudden drop in the willingness to look for work, but disincentives in our tax and transfer payments can.
<P>
<b>Savings:</b> Gross private savings amounted to only 14.6 per cent of GDP in 1993 - 95, down from 17.2 per cent in 1983 - 89.
<P>
Was this trip really necessary?
<P>
Even in the very few areas where the economy appears to have fared relatively well, it still fails to measure up to the lofty standards set by the Reagan years. The Clinton Administration points with pride to growth of real exports, which did indeed rise at an 8.3 per cent rate over the past three years. But imports grew faster -- at a 10 per cent rate. In 1983 - 89, by contrast, real exports grew by 9.4 per cent a year, and imports by 8.6 per cent.
<P>
One statistic almost summarizes all the rest: Median family income fell by more than 5 per cent from 1989 through 1994 (the latest available figure). By contrast, median family income rose by 12.6 per cent from 1982 to 1989. These figures are before taxes, so they understate the actual drop in living standards following the 1993 increase in taxes on incomes, Social Security benefits and gasoline.
<P>
Income statistics for 1995 and 1996 are unlikely to look much better. Real wages were flat in 1995, and employment nearly so (by January 1996, employment was only 0.4 per cent higher than a year earlier). Wages picked up a bit in early 1996, but so did inflation. The increase in consumer prices averaged 3.6 per cent in the first half of this year, wiping out nominal wage increases in the process. Recent employment gains have slowed to 1.5 per cent or less, compared with the same month a year ago.
<P>
Because employment grew at about the same slow 2 per cent pace as the economy in the past three years, it follows that output per worker (productivity) must have grown very slowly. Indeed, productivity growth averaged only 0.6 per cent in 1993 - 95, down from 1.6 in 1983 - 89. There is no mystery at all about why real wages have stagnated in the past three years, despite a flood of misinformed news reports on that topic. Real output per worker and real income per worker are just two different ways of looking at the same thing. If we don't produce more, there won't be more to go around.
<P>
The Clinton Administration would much prefer to reduce all these uncomfortable economic comparisons to a single statement -- namely, the claim that the President himself has personally ``created'' nearly ten million jobs. The reason for that single-minded focus is obvious: ten million new jobs sounds like an impressive number. In fact, it isn't. If employment had grown as rapidly in 1993 - 95 as it did in 1983 - 89, the economy would have generated two million <I>more</I> jobs than it did between the end of 1992 and 1995.
<P>
There are two ways the unemployment rate can go down. One is for employers to offer more jobs. The other is for fewer people to go looking for jobs (to be listed as unemployed you must be looking for a job and not finding one). As it happens, surprisingly few people have been looking for work. Growth in the labor force has slowed to a crawl. This puts severe limits on future employment growth, and therefore on economic growth as well. And it is one link, but only one, between the decidedly mediocre growth of output and income and the 1993 increase in marginal tax rates.
<P>
The 1996 Economic Report of the President complains, ``some claimed these tax rate increases [e.g., in 1993] would do severe harm to the economy by creating disincentives for individuals to work and save. Again, these forecasts turned out to be false, just as did the earlier supply-side forecasts of rapid growth from tax reductions.'' It is difficult to imagine what numbers the President's economists have been looking at. If 3.9 per cent economic growth from 1983 to 1989 did not constitute ``rapid growth from tax reductions,'' then what are we to make of 2.3 per cent growth from Mr. Clinton's higher tax rates?
<P>
When it comes to ``disincentives for individuals to work,'' look at what the Economic Report itself says: ``The increase in the overall labor-force-participation rate has slowed since the late 1980s. . . . The stagnant participation rate has been one of the more enduring aspects of this expansion.'' Many secondary earners, mostly women, dropped out of the job market after the counterproductive, revenue-losing tax-rate increases of 1990 and 1993. The percentage of families with two or more earners, for example, dropped to 56.4 per cent in 1993 from 58.2 per cent in 1989, while the percentage with zero workers rose. This should come as no surprise. Assuming the first earner makes more than $140,000, the very first dollar of a second earner's income is now taxed at the same demoralizing 36 - 40 per cent rate as the first earner's last dollar.
<P>
More and more people are also retiring earlier. This too was quite predictable. The extra 1993 tax on Social Security benefits severely punishes older people who keep working, or who made the mistake of having saved enough to afford a modest retirement. The increase in the already punitive estate tax also undermines a major incentive for working and saving in later years.
<P>
In 1993, the earned-income tax credit increased the share of the loot given to those with incomes well above the poverty level. That too discouraged additional work and additional workers. Marginal tax rates on any extra income are now 50 - 75 per cent for two-thirds of EITC recipients.
<P>
The reduction in the supply of willing workers is what kept the measured unemployment rate low, despite the fact that employment has grown by only 1.3 per cent a year since 1991, down from 2.4 per cent in 1983 - 89. Labor Department demographers had forecast that the labor force would grow by 1.3 per cent a year in the 1990s, but it has not even grown by 1 per cent. If the number of job seekers had grown as rapidly as the demographic experts suggested, there would be a lot more people looking for work, and the unemployment rate would now be well above 8 per cent. If the labor force had grown as rapidly as in the Eighties, the unemployment rate would exceed 11 per cent.
<P>
What about ``disincentives . . . to save''? Since tax rates went up in 1993, personal saving has dropped to 4.2 per cent of after-tax income, down from 5.9 per cent in 1992. Measured in constant 1992 dollars, real personal saving was only $223.8 billion in 1995, compared with $310.5 billion ten years earlier. Increased tax rates on high-income individuals and on corporations directly reduced the amount of disposable income left to save, as well as reducing incentives to save.
<P>
Apologists for Clinton's economic policies often blame Alan Greenspan for the sluggish growth of output and income. Has the Fed been discouraging growth through excessively tight monetary policy? Hardly. Short-term interest rates have been much lower in the past three years than they ever were in 1983 - 89, in both nominal and real terms. In other words, the Fed was less accommodating in the 1980s than today, but we had higher growth then.
<P>
By the time of the November election, living standards will have gone nowhere but down for seven years. This is unprecedented. In the 49 years that figures on median family income have been collected, they never before declined for seven years. The worst economic performance in fifty years, as Mr. Clinton used to say, is arguably right now.

<FONT SIZE=+3>T</FONT><font size=+1>HE</font> conventional wisdom is that the Republican Party is the party of the rich, while the Democrats represent the working class. But under Ronald Reagan's policies working-class Americans prospered, and under Clintonomics, the working class has lost ground. Only the rich have prospered on Clinton's watch.
<P>
During the 1980s, each uptick in the share of total income going to the wealthy was trumpeted on the front page of every major newspaper as evidence that the Reaganomics had created an era of greed and income disparity. And indeed, the wealthy were better off. The share of total income going to the top 20 per cent of households rose by 2.4 per cent, and the share going to the top 5 per cent rose by 1.9 per cent during the Reagan Administration. Yet during just the first two years of the Clinton Administration (the latest data go only through 1994), the top 20 per cent increased their share of the income pie as much as they did during the entire eight years of the Reagan Administration. And the top 5 per cent have done even better, increasing their share of total income by 2.5 per cent.
<P>
In fact, the share of total income gained by the top 20 per cent of households hit an all-time high in 1994 (49.1 per cent), as did the share going to the top 5 per cent (21.2 per cent). The top quintile's share of total income was significantly lower in every year of the Reagan Administration than in either of Clinton's first two. In 1988, the year under Reagan when the rich did the best, the top quintile received 46.3 per cent of total income and the top 5 per cent received 18.3 per cent. In other words, income gains in the 1980s were more evenly divided among the income classes than has been the case in the 1990s.
<P>
How can this be? Clinton's first priority after taking office was to raise taxes on the rich precisely in order to reduce income inequality. This is why the very centerpiece of his economic program was an increase in the top tax rate from 31 per cent to 39.6 per cent -- to force the rich to pay more. Yet all the evidence thus far shows that income inequality became worse following the tax increase. Nevertheless after release of the latest income data, the <I>Washington Post</I> and other media outlets editorialized against the Republican Congress's proposed tax cut because it ``would add to what is already so disturbing a trend'' of greater income inequality.
<P>
At least Reagan could argue that although the rich got richer, so did everyone else. Real median family income (in 1994 dollars) rose from $36,825 when he took office to $40,890 by the time he left. Furthermore, the average real income of those in the bottom quintile of households rose from $7,954 to $8,391, and the income of those in the second lowest quintile rose from $18,856 to $20,797. The third and fourth quintiles also saw significant increases.
<P>
By contrast, median family income has been flat during the Clinton Administration. During its first two years, real median family income averaged $38,343, down from $38,632 in 1992 and well below the level when Reagan left office. The income of the bottom quintile has averaged $7,681 and that of the second quintile has averaged $19,176. In 1992 these groups averaged $7,698 and $19,205, respectively. However, the average income of the top quintile rose from $96,240 in 1992 to $105,945 in 1994, and that of the top 5 per cent went from $152,751 to $183,044.
<P>
Other measures of income also show that the non-rich have not benefited at all from Clinton's policies. Workers, for example, are no better off today than they were when Clinton took office. In January 1993 real average weekly earnings for private-sector workers were $253.76 (in 1982 dollars). In May 1996, the most recent month for which there are data, real earnings were $253.80. That works out to a real pay increase of just one cent per week for every year Clinton has been in office.
<P>
History teaches us that it is virtually impossible to reduce the share of income going to the wealthy by raising their taxes. The reason is that the negative economic effects of raising marginal tax rates reduce everyone's incomes. The only way to raise the share of income going to the non-wealthy is by increasing the rate of economic growth. The source of the wealthy's gains during the Clinton years has been lower interest rates and a strong stock market.
<P>
Workers, meanwhile, have seen their incomes squeezed by Clinton's policies -- the prosperity has not trickled down. Only an aggressive pro-growth policy of supply-side tax cuts and less regulation will improve their living standards. Contrary to conventional wisdom, throughout American history a rising tide really has lifted all boats. Clinton's austerity has succeeded in lifting only the yachts of the Kennedys and the Rockefellers.

<FONT SIZE=+3>P</FONT><font size=+1>RODUCTIVITY</font> growth has been only 0.5 per cent a year on Bill Clinton's watch, the lowest rate through an Administration since Herbert Hoover. Worker productivity since 1993 has been only about one-third the rate under Ronald Reagan (1.3 per cent) and has even been well below the rate under George Bush (0.9 per cent).
<P>
We care about productivity rates because this is what drives the real wages of workers. Given the anemic productivity rates since 1993, it should hardly be surprising that the growth of average real (inflation-adjusted) labor compensation under Clinton has also been very low. This is the primary reason, even with low unemployment and inflation, why many Americans are concerned about their economic future. This is the primary pocketbook issue on which Clinton's record is vulnerable.
<P>
The average rate of worker-productivity growth has declined somewhat unevenly for thirty years, interrupted only by a temporary upswing during the Reagan years. The reasons for this long-term decline are not fully understood by economists, let alone policymakers, but the following conditions are at least partly responsible:
<P>
<blockquote>
1. Too many young workers have low job skills, despite a long-term increase of real spending per student by over 30 per cent a decade. The average composite SAT score peaked in 1963, declined almost continuously through 1980, and has since been roughly stable.<br>
2. Taxes as a percentage of GDP have increased by about 5 points beginning with the Vietnam War and the expansion of the welfare state in the mid 1960s.<br>
3. The costs of health, safety, and environmental regulation and of civil litigation increased sharply beginning in the early 1970s.<br>
4. The net national saving rate has declined sharply over the past 15 years, reflecting the combination of a decline in the private saving rate and an increase in the federal deficit. The private sector has been able to maintain a somewhat higher investment rate only by a substantial increase in borrowing from foreigners.</blockquote>
<P>
President Clinton did not create these conditions, but he should be judged by what, if anything, he has done to alleviate them.
<P>
As it has turned out, the Clinton Administration and, more generally, the national Democratic Party, has been an enemy of the very types of policies that are necessary to increase productivity growth. Let me count the ways:
<P>
<blockquote>
 -- In response to the teachers' unions, Clinton has opposed school vouchers, even in the District of Columbia (where his daughter attends a private school). In response to the industrial unions, Clinton proposed a substantial increase in the minimum wage (which reduces the opportunity for on-the-job training) and opposed a bill that would have relaxed the restriction on ``quality circles'' in non-union firms.<br>
 -- At almost every decision point, Clinton has sided with the current beneficiaries of federal spending rather than with present and future taxpayers. Both Bush and Clinton addressed the deficit more by increasing taxes than by reducing domestic spending. As a consequence, the top marginal rate on earnings was increased from 28 per cent to 42 per cent. For any given reduction in the deficit, however, the economic benefits of reduced spending have proved to be much higher than the benefits of higher tax revenues. In other words, it matters a lot <I>how</I> we balance the budget.<br>
 -- Fortunately, there has been relatively little new regulatory legislation on Clinton's watch; indeed a substantial deregulation of agriculture and telecommunications was approved (though without much of an Administration role). But Clinton and congressional Democrats blocked other regulatory-reform measures. Of greater concern, Clinton seems to have given the Environmental Protection Agency and the Food and Drug Administration almost free rein. For example, the FDA has proposed major restrictions on tobacco marketing with no clear statutory authority.
 -- In response to the trial lawyers, Clinton vetoed bills to restrict shareholder suits and to reform product-liability law. The costly litigation explosion is another factor in the deterioration in productivity.<br>
 -- Senior members of the Administration have demonized corporate CEOs, the banking industry, drug firms, the insurance industry, oil companies, the medical profession, and tobacco firms. Clinton has jeopardized foreign investment by threatening to extend U.S. law to the operations of parent companies abroad. Which firm, industry, or profession is next?<br>
 -- Clinton opposes proposals to reduce the tax bias against saving and investment while refusing to even acknowledge the multi-trillion dollar implicit debt of the Social Security system.</blockquote>
<p>

In sum, the damage done by President Clinton is not primarily that productivity growth has declined on his brief watch. It is that with few exceptions, he has actively opposed the measures that the United States must take to reverse this disturbing trend. Ironically, Bill Clinton ran for President in 1992 issuing a challenge to the American people to have ``the courage to change.'' Now he is the adversary of the very changes in policies that are imperative to build a prosperous future for our children. On this record, Clinton has no claim to the mantle of compassion.

<FONT SIZE=+3>I</FONT><font size=+1>F</font> Woody Allen was right that 90 per cent of life is just showing up, then Bill Clinton has a stellar fiscal record. The federal budget deficit has tumbled from $255 billion in 1993 to a projected $117 billion this year. And Clinton was there when it happened. But that just about covers the extent of his involvement. For evidence of this, let's review the Clinton record over the past three and a half years:
<P>
<blockquote>
 -- In February 1993 President Clinton announces his new Administration's first economic program: a $16-billion ``fiscal stimulus.'' The spending package is later abandoned by the Democratic Congress as too fiscally irresponsible.
<P>
 -- In February 1993 President Clinton wins passage of his $250-billion tax hike -- which New York Sen. Pat Moynihan accurately describes as ``the largest tax increase in world history.'' It passes both houses of Congress without a single Republican vote. The package contains approximately $2 of new spending for every $1 of new taxes.
<P>
 -- In September 1993 the Clinton White House lobbies to defeat the bi-partisan Penny - Kasich deficit-reduction bill, which would have cut federal spending and the deficit by $90 billion over five years.
<P>
 -- In January 1994 Bill and Hillary Clinton unveil ``ClintonCare.'' The proposed hostile federal takeover of one-seventh of the U.S. economy would add at least $75 billion to the deficit over the next six years, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). 
<P>
 -- In September 1994 the President furiously lobbies liberal Democrats in Congress to oppose a Balanced Budget Amendment -- a measure supported by 75 per cent of the American public. Labor Secretary Robert Reich is a little too honest when he confirms most Americans' suspicions about this Administration: ``The President is against simply balancing the budget.''
<P>
 -- In October 1994 the President signs into law his $30-billion ``crime bill.'' The <I>Los Angeles Times</I> describes the legislation as a ``once-in-a-lifetime  federal spending bonanza'' containing ``a vast array of new social programs'' including federally funded exotic-dance classes, sensitivity-training courses, and midnight-basketball leagues. The cost of the Clinton bill has to be shaved after the Democratic House of Representatives rejects the original version as too expensive.
<P>
 -- In January 1995 Bill Clinton submits a 1996 budget plan that calls for $12 trillion of spending over the next seven years and $200-billion deficits for as far as the eye can see. Even <I>Washington Post</I> reporter David Broder blasts the document as a ``symbol of Clinton's failed leadership.'' Because of the debt Clinton is adding, writes Broder, ``the annual net interest is projected to climb from $198 billion in 1993 to $270 billion in 1997 -- when it will, for the first time, be larger than the projected defense budget.''
<P>
 -- In March 1995 Clinton again helps torpedo the Balanced Budget Amendment -- this time by strong-arming five Democratic senators, who had campaigned as champions of the amendment -- to flip-flop and vote no.
<P>
 -- In June 1995, under pressure from the GOP Congress, Bill Clinton submits a new, revised budget proposal. It still doesn't balance the budget by 2002.
<P>
 -- In July 1995 the Clinton White House begins its successful ``Medi-scare'' strategy to undermine public support for a GOP plan to rein in stampeding Medicare costs. Even the <I>Washington Post</I> editorializes that the Clinton Administration has become a gang of ``medagogues.'' On Medicare and Medicaid, the White House is ``engaged in an irresponsible campaign based on distortion and fear.''
<P>
 -- In October 1995 Bill Clinton confirms what most of the public is already painfully aware of: ``I raised your taxes too much.''
<P>
 -- In December 1995 Bill Clinton vetoes the historic balanced-budget legislation enacted by the Republican Congress -- listing 82 reasons why it cuts too much spending. He complains of cuts in everything from foreign aid to corporate welfare.
<P>
 -- Later that month Bill Clinton releases his unprecedented third and then fourth budget proposals of the year. But they <I>still</I> don't balance the budget.
<P>
 -- In February 1996 Bill Clinton releases a $1.65-trillion 1997 budget that calls for $360 billion in added spending, or $3,100 per American household, over the next seven years. Then with a straight face he tells the nation that ``the era of big government is over.'' Oh, and the proposal <I>still</I> doesn't balance the budget by 2002.
<P>
 -- In April 1996 Clinton signs the GOP budget after the Republicans capitulate to his demands and add back some $10 billion of deficit spending.
</blockquote>
<P>
<font size=+3>W</font><font size=+1>HEW!</font> This really is a pillar of fiscal integrity we have in the White House. The point of this demoralizing three-and-a-half-year budget odyssey is this: The Clinton Administration cannot credibly claim credit for the reduction in the deficit unless the nation is suffering from a severe case of fiscal amnesia.
<P>
On at least three separate occasions in 1993 and 1994 -- the fiscal-stimulus package, ClintonCare, and the crime bill -- the Administration attempted to make the deficit situation worse, but amazingly was constrained by a Democratic Congress. On four other instances, bipartisan deficit-reduction initiatives were rebuked by Clinton. 
<P>
Since the Republicans took control of Congress in November of 1994, Clinton's fiscal obstructionism and demagoguery has been elevated to Olympic levels. The Republicans' budget-balancing plan was thrashed almost daily by the White House as ``mean-spirited,'' ``radical,'' ``harmful to children, the poor, and the environment,'' and ``just plain wrong for America.'' Yet in typical Clinton fashion, one day the budget is denounced as ``wrong for America,'' the next day the White House is staging a Rose Garden press conference claiming credit for the impressive first-year deficit reduction that the ``mean-spirited'' Republican budget produced.
<P>
So how much of the credit for the impressive drop in the deficit this year does the Administration deserve? The standard spin from the White House these days is that the ``enormous progress'' on the deficit vindicates the Clinton ``$500-billion deficit-reduction'' package of 1993. It turns out we can roughly calculate how much of the deficit decline is attributable to Clinton, and how much to Newt Gingrich and the Republican Congress. Back in April 1995, just before the Republicans released their seven-year balanced-budget plan, the CBO announced that Clinton's deficit-reduction plan would produce $211 billion of red ink in 1996.
<P>
Instead, the deficit will fall to $117 billion. That's a $94-billion improvement -- almost entirely attributable to the GOP budget. Over the entire seven-year budget window, the Gingrich plan chops a shade over $1 trillion ($1,000,000,000,000) of deficit spending from the Clintonomics baseline.
<P>
The budget deficit would be lower still had it not been for Bill Clinton's vetoes of Republican Medicare, Medicaid, welfare, and appropriations bills. Those vetoes canceled an estimated $10 to $15 billion in budget cuts for 1996 -- savings that would have been magnified in future years.
<P>
GOP partisans can hardly exult in the deficit story of the past five years, however. Despite this Administration's sorry record of fiscal obstructionism, there is still the unarguable underlying fact that Bill Clinton's overall fiscal performance has been far superior to that of his predecessor, George Bush.
<P>
All the deficit reduction of the last three years is simply recovering the lost ground of the early 1990s -- Richard Darman's reign of fiscal terror. It is a popular myth that George Bush inherited a budget crisis ``baked in the cake'' from Ronald Reagan. When Reagan left the White House in January 1989, the deficit was $150 billion and forecast to decline gradually till it reached $110 billion in 1995. The CBO concluded that continued deficit reduction would occur if Bush (and Darman) simply left fiscal policy on automatic pilot.
<P>
Instead, we got Bush's infamous reversal on ``no new taxes'' and a 1990 budget package that dealt a body blow to an already ailing economy and sent the deficit into the stratosphere. From 1990 to 1995 the national debt soared $622 billion above the levels anticipated in 1989. Richard Darman's enduring legacy to the nation is this: 1990 - 94 was the worst five-year deficit performance since World War II. Now really, how hard has it been for Clinton to improve on that rotten fiscal record?
<P>
The Left is now again busy trying to rewrite history to suggest that the Bush 1990 and the Clinton 1993 tax hikes contributed mightily to the decline in the deficit. The top marginal income-tax rate has risen by 50 per cent -- from 28 per cent in 1989 to 42 per cent this year. Yet federal revenues grew faster in the 1980s with Reagan's substantial across-the-board tax cut than during the 1990s with these two giant tax hikes.
<P>
Overall real federal revenues (1982 to 1989) grew by 24 per cent during the seven-year period after the Reagan tax cuts took full effect. But (as currently forecast by the Congressional Budget Office) overall federal revenue growth from 1990 through 1997 will be only 18.5 per cent. If federal revenues had grown in the 1990s at only the pace they did after the Reagan tax cuts, federal receipts in 1996 would be almost $50 billion greater and the deficit would be one-third smaller.
<P>
Income-tax receipts after adjusting for inflation rose by 16.3 per cent in the seven years after the full Reagan tax cut. Income-tax receipts will have climbed by 16.1 per cent in real terms in the seven years since 1990.
<P>
So where is the evidence that these tax increases actually raised revenues?
<P>
If tax hikes don't account for the lowering of the deficit, what does? America's victory in the Cold War. (The extent of Bill Clinton's contribution to that effort was in obtaining draft deferments.) In the 1980s the nation invested $2 trillion on the Reagan military build-up to vanquish the Evil Empire -- perhaps the only truly successful government program of the last half-century. Now we are rapidly demilitarizing, creating a vast budget windfall. Over the past eight years the Pentagon's budget has fallen by almost $110 billion in real terms. How's this for a coincidence: that's almost precisely how much the real budget deficit has fallen over that period.
<P>
Normally in post-war years the United States Government not only moves immediately back to a balanced-budget regime, but cuts taxes and then runs budget <I>surpluses</I> to begin paying off the wartime debt. In the post - Cold War 1990s none of those things have happened. No tax cut. No balanced budget. No liquidation of the debt. Instead defense cutbacks have helped camouflage a sustained non-defense spending build-up. Between 1989 and 1995, real defense outlays have fallen by one-third, while everything else we spend money on -- from peanut subsidies to the Mark Hatfield Memorial Courthouse in Portland -- has climbed by $300 billion, or 30 per cent. Last year federal spending on non-defense programs consumed 18 per cent of national output, a larger share than at any previous time in American history. The nanny state is alive and well in America.
<P>
So much so that we can now add the most recent and depressing entry to the Clinton fiscal chronology:
<P>
<blockquote>
 -- In July 1996 the CBO announces that the Clinton deficit-reduction honeymoon is over. After 1997, the Clinton baseline outlook steadily deteriorates in every year for the next decade. Then the government's finances implode. Runaway entitlement expenditures -- particularly for Medicare and Medicaid -- ravage the budget. The CBO predicts that unless transfer payments are curtailed the nation faces a future of ``unsustainably high levels of federal borrowing,'' with the national debt ascending relentlessly from 60 per cent of national output today, to 150 per cent by 2025.</blockquote>
<P>
Thank you, Bill Clinton.

<FONT SIZE=+3>B</FONT><font size=+1>ILL</font> Clinton's 1993 tax package included the biggest hike in income-tax rates since Herbert Hoover's misguided tax increase in 1930. Supporters of the tax hike argued that the higher taxes on the rich would bring in much-needed revenues to reduce the budget deficit, and would also help close the gap between the incomes of the rich and poor.
<P>
Yet the most remarkable feature of the Clinton tax hike has been its failure to generate additional revenues. Even liberals, after all, presumably do not favor higher tax rates just for the sake of punishing success. Do they? Yet consider the following: Taxes consumed 19.2 per cent of economic output (GDP) the year Reagan left office. Since that time, there have been two major tax increases, the Bush tax hike of 1990 and Clinton's record increase of 1993. The impact on tax collections? The Congressional Budget Office estimates revenues this year will total 19.1 per cent of GDP, down by one-tenth of a point.
<P>
The futility of higher tax rates can be seen by examining income-tax revenues as a percent of GDP. Higher income-tax rates were to be the major revenue raisers in both the Bush and the Clinton tax hikes, yet income-tax revenues have fallen from 8.6 per cent of GDP when Reagan left office to 8.5 per cent this year, according to the CBO. These numbers are particularly compelling since income-tax revenues typically rise over time as a percentage of GDP in countries with ``progressive'' tax systems, as even modest increases in income gradually push people into higher tax brackets. The Clinton Administration no doubt would point out that revenues fell under Bush and have risen in the last four years, but this pick-up in revenues is mainly a function of the business cycle and does not change the underlying fact that government is collecting less as a percentage of output even though (or rather, because) the top income-tax rate is 50 per cent higher today than it was at the end of the Reagan era.
<P>
The failure of income-tax-rate increases can also be confirmed by examining the growth of income-tax revenue in constant dollars. During the Reagan years, when tax rates were reduced twice, inflation-adjusted income-tax revenues rose an average of 2.2 per cent each year. In the post -  Reagan era, which has seen two massive tax-rate increases, revenue growth has slowed to 1.3 per cent annually. Once again, the White House would argue that this comparison does not distinguish between Bush and Clinton, but, since the two Presidents had virtually identical policies of raising tax rates on the rich, such a distinction would be meaningless.
<P>
Income-tax revenues also grew substantially faster in the 1960s after President Kennedy's 30 per cent across-the-board tax cuts than in the 1950s with tax rates as high as 90 per cent. In the 1950s real income-tax receipts were flat. Following the Kennedy tax cuts, the revenues increased at a 4.8 per cent clip. After LBJ's surtax, revenue growth again fell by more than half. There seems to be a pattern emerging here.
<P>
So if the Bush and Clinton tax increases failed to raise revenues, why has government borrowing declined by more than $100 billion since Clinton took office? Two reasons. First, large real cutbacks in the defense budget of nearly 6 per cent annually; and second, a slow down in the growth of inflation-adjusted domestic spending from the enormous 6.3 per cent annual average under George Bush to 2.5 per cent under Clinton. Yes, it's a sad but true fiscal fact that federal spending has been far more restrained during the Clinton Administration than it was during the Bush Administration. But both Presidents' attempts to gain revenues by raising tax rates have been utterly futile.

<FONT SIZE=+3>W</FONT><font size=+1>HERE</font>  was the nation's First Stepmother when, according to the best liberal opinion, the future of America's children was being destroyed by the passage of welfare reform? The welfare-rights coalition and Children's Defense Fund President Marian Wright Edelman were frantically lobbying the White House for a presidential veto. In their effort to influence the President, NOW members even launched a hunger strike (and they might just have caught his eye if they had slimmed down). But while this pitched battle was going on, Hillary Clinton -- missing in action. 
<P>
Yet the First Lady, whose public life has been ostentatiously dedicated to the well-being of children, has curiously escaped being held to account by her liberal allies. She may have persuaded them that she was pleading their case behind closed doors, but it's more likely that Edelman and Co. recognize what one liberal advocate in Arkansas reluctantly concluded long ago: ``We learned not to expect anything of Hillary. What was the one thing she would go to the wall for? Bill's Presidency.'' 
<P>
Yet with the Administration deeply divided over whether or not to sign the welfare bill, there's little doubt that Hillary's influence would have been decisive. Richard Reeves enjoyed lunch at the White House with the Clintons recently and reported that the President glanced guiltily at Hillary to seek permission before ordering a piece of blueberry pie. If Hillary controls Bill's pastry consumption, she certainly could have prevented him from swallowing the distasteful gruel of welfare reform. But although Hillary has been committed to spending other people's money on behalf of liberal causes, she has been unwilling to spend Bill's political capital to advance the agenda. In the Clinton household, politics counts for more than principles and even friendship (just ask Lani Guinier).
<P>
Confronted with the First Lady's unprecedented unpopularity -- the latest polls show her favorability rating below sea level (30 per cent) -- one defender argues that Hillary makes us uncomfortable because she is so good. Ruth Rosen, professor of history at the University of California at Davis, explains that Hillary is ``the perfect scapegoat because she has a moral compass and is not afraid to follow it.''
<P>
In fact, Hillary's compass always pointed straight to the White House. Betsy Wright, Clinton's chief of staff when he was governor, speculates that the Clintons thought that Bill could win the Presidency from the time they married. Bill had the vision, Hillary provided the focus and discipline. When his mother had trouble accepting a daughter-in-law whom she regarded as a prickly, unattractive feminist, he reportedly explained: ``Look, Ma, I have work to do. I don't need to be married to a sex goddess.'' 
<P>
A politically successful partnership with a division of responsibility was formed from Clinton's early days as governor. Bill bobbed about in the centrist waters of Arkansas and joined the moderate Democratic Leadership Council in the mid Eighties. It fell to Hillary, with her collegiate history of liberal activism, to nail down the Democratic base. Hillary accordingly served on the national boards of the Legal Services Corporation, the Children's Defense Fund, and the leftist New World Foundation.
<P>
But her espousal of liberal causes was strictly for export. Back home she had shed her maiden name, thick glasses, 15 pounds, and opposition to capital punishment. In particular, her advocacy on behalf of neglected children was a wholesale, out-of-state operation. While she toiled on the national scene urging Congress to live up to its moral responsibilities, the child-welfare system in Arkansas became a national disgrace. Its comparative infant mortality rate increased during her husband's 12-year tenure. But national reputations are not made by small local improvements.
<P>
Following Bill Clinton's jarring defeat for re-election in 1980, Hillary was better able to protect her investment in him than in Whitewater. Having already reformed her feminist appearance, she went to work on her irritating tendency to aloofness and superiority. An aide to Governor Clinton explained, ``This is a very personal state. Now, for Clinton that empathy is natural. But Hillary learned how to project it.''
<P>
<font size=+3>B</font><font size==1>UT</font> not convincingly. Her sense of superiority is still apparent. People aren't having trouble -- as Ann Lewis endlessly insists they are -- reconciling themselves to a new kind of First Lady who is independent, accomplished, and outspoken. The dislike of the First Lady has nothing to do with people's inability to adjust to ``the changing nature of women's roles'' or with any discomfort we mortals might feel when confronted by the noble and virtuous. People dislike the First Lady because they reasonably resent someone who believes herself to be morally superior to them even as she pursues power and status like the most cynical of politicians.
<P>
In short, Hillary Clinton wants to be influential and prominent without the scrutiny and accountability that politicians must endure. She wants to be viewed as having a successful, independent career while having traded on her influence and access as the governor's wife. Her formidable skills of advocacy are used to attack Bill's opponents, who can't fight back against his wife as they would against the President himself. Above all, she wants the rewards associated with success in the private sector while pursuing political advancement in the foundation world and public sector.
<P>
Hillary insists that pro-bono legal work is ``the heart and soul of the law,'' but her own work in the cause of legal aid or children's rights was either compensated or politically useful. The righteous Wellesley graduate who told her fellow students that the ``acquisitive, and competitive corporate life . . . is not the way of life for us'' earned $129,000 in directors' fees from Arkansas corporations. 
<P>
She notes in addition the burden she has carried to support the family. When questioned about apparent influence peddling, conflicts of interest, or cattle futures, she impatiently cites the enormous financial sacrifices the Clintons have made to permit Bill's public service. But while the Clintons were making these sacrifices for the common good in Arkansas, the state's taxpayers footed the bill for food, shelter, servants, and entertainment; the Arkansas state auditor estimated their upkeep cost at $750,000 annually.
<P>
Hillary bitterly resents being questioned about such matters. She has always hated the media and now believes the press is becoming ``the handmaiden of the Right,'' no less. But the press rises above it, and women journalists in particular would rather burnish the feminist icon than examine its calves of clay. We're told about the unswerving ``sense of mission'' that has kept Hillary too busy to respond cogently to accusations of improprieties. It's Hillary's ``do-good energy'' that makes her ``fierce and protective.'' 
<P>
These warm maternal qualities are not always evident to those who know her well. An admiring friend whose divorce Hillary handled confessed that she was fearful of her own attorney. ``I would never cross her,'' she declares. Hillary encouraged the media to investigate some alleged infidelities of George Bush during the 1992 campaign -- that ``sense of mission,'' no doubt. And her temper in general has been well documented. When she advised in her recent book that, in order to stay married, sometimes ``you have to bite your tongue,'' one can't help wondering if that's in order to improve her aim.
<P>
Fortunately, Hillary's brusque self-confidence trumped her pragmatism when it came to reforming the health-care system. This was one reform that wasn't about Bill; it was her baby, to be loved, cherished, and delivered on time. She was fighting not for ClintonCare but for Rodham Rx. Convinced that her efforts had produced a near-perfect product, she would brook no criticism and make no compromise. If Hillary Clinton had a dash of modesty, our health care would probably have been socialized. But she allowed the worst to be the enemy of the bad.
<P>
Despite her withdrawal into purdah, Hillary remains the motive force behind ideological liberalism in the White House and the Administration generally. She had a hand in the major liberal appointments, like that of Donna Shalala as Secretary of Health and Human Services. She has salted the agencies with her followers. And she is a presence who inspires awe and even fear in senior aides.
<P>
Her legal writings, her Arkansas practice, and her record in the world of legal activism all show her to be a devout believer in the power of government to transform human lives for the better. Her sense of mission, which this belief inspires, allows her to bend the rules -- whether in Whitewater or in organizing the White House Health Care Task Force -- with a clear conscience. She is one of nature's Commissars. Among New Democrats, that makes her a Lenin in a den of Daniels. But it is her ill fortune to come within a heartbeat of power in a conservative age of diminished expectations for centralized power and what government can achieve.
<P>
At first she resisted this truth and tried to push through a total restructuring of health care by the sheer power of presidential authority and her own self-confidence. But she was defeated. And just as after the 1980 Arkansas gubernatorial election, she learned from her defeat. Her prudent silence in the face of welfare reform is one evidence of a lesson learned. Another, as Ramesh Ponnuru  points out, is her return to reforming health care by a Fabian policy of gradualism. If Hillary has her way, health care will be socialized little by little, and we won't notice until the trap is sprung.

<FONT SIZE=+3>O</FONT><font size=+1>N</font> June 22, 1994, Secretary of Labor Robert Reich, to no fanfare whatsoever, issued Interpretative Bulletin 94-1 (IB 94-1). The bulletin applied to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), a 1974 law designed to protect pension funds from reckless managers. Section 404 of the law makes creating benefits for pension beneficiaries the ``exclusive purpose'' of pension investing. This is the part of ERISA that Reich's bulletin re-interpreted, saying pension-fund managers could consider both the interests of beneficiaries and secondary benefits to other parties when investing pension funds. A hard-to-follow exercise in bureaucratic minutiae? Well, yes. Insignificant? No. Interpretative Bulletin 94-1 was an opening shot in a Clinton Administration policy offensive potentially as radical in scope as its health-care plan, an attempt to tap into a portion of the nation's $3.5 trillion in private pension-money funds to advance its social agenda.
<P>
The re-interpretation of ERISA, and the supporting efforts surrounding it, exemplify the way the Clinton Administration has tweaked regulations and interpretations of law to make policy advances; the way its mid-level personnel has agitated for an agenda at odds with the Administration's public, centrist pose; and the cozy relationship between the Clinton Executive Branch and the activist Left. The Executive Branch and the larger federal bureaucracy by themselves -- without grandiose legislative proposals or high-profile public advocacy -- provide endless opportunities for prosecuting an ideological agenda and protecting the cold political interests of a President. This most political Administration has taken every opportunity afforded it, prospering in Washington's legal and bureaucratic thickets.
<P>
The Clinton Administration re-interpreted ERISA so as to clear the way for so-called Economically Targeted Investments (ETIs). A long-time favorite of the Left, the thrust of ETIs is to steer private pension funds to public purposes (investments in public housing, infrastructure projects, jobs programs, etc.). For the Left, ETIs are a handy way to control middle-class dollars -- diverting retirement funds from more profitable uses -- without an actual tax increase. Clinton, who promoted ETIs in Arkansas, included in his 1992 policy manifesto ``Putting People First'' a proposal for $80 billion of federal investment in social projects to be leveraged with public and private pensions. Once he took office, his Administration began to push the ETI agenda, beneath headlines and the notice of much of the public.
<P>
Assistant Labor Secretary Olena Berg banged the drums across the country for ETIs. A former board member of the California Public Employees Retirement System, which had already gone in big for social investments, she boasted that ``This is the beginning of a turning point.'' In February of 1994 she urged big investors, according to <I>Business Week</I>, ``to invest the dollars now held by pension funds in ways that create more jobs.'' HUD Secretary Henry Cisneros, meanwhile, was setting up what he called a ``precedent-setting initiative to attract pension-fund investments to housing for low-income people''; six pension funds agreed to invest in affordable housing projects with $100 million in federal backing. After the Administration issued IB94-1 in June of 1994, it also set up a federal ``clearinghouse'' to showcase successful social investments. 
<P>
The pedigree of ETIs -- Miss Berg herself calls them ``a radical notion'' -- has been documented by the Joint Economic Committee (JEC), which has worked aggressively to expose the Clinton offensive on pensions. A moving force behind the idea is the Center for Policy Alternatives (CPA), a socialistic spin-off of the radical Institute for Policy Studies. CPA has flacked tirelessly for ETIs at least since 1990. In the Clinton Administration, it finally had a sympathetic ear. A CPA conference on the idea in 1995 drew some half-dozen Administration participants. CPA's ``public capital program'' manager tells of working closely with Administration officials on ETIs. Indeed, the idea of a clearinghouse had been proposed by CPA, and the Administration initially even selected the organization as the contractor for the project.
<P>
All this has effectively been shut down by Rep. Jim Saxton (R., N.J.), vice chairman of the JEC, who sponsored a bill that passed by a wide margin, repealing Reich's IB 94-1 and abolishing the clearinghouse. The pension issue is a natural for the GOP, and Democrats sense it. But the feckless Sen. Nancy Kassebaum has sat on a companion bill in the Senate. Which is par for the course: the Administration pushing to the limits on behalf of its agenda, while Republicans pull up short on the counterattack. ``They're chillingly pragmatic about all this, realizing that they can't advance the liberal parts of their agenda publicly so they find imaginative ways to try to do it anyway,'' says one House aide. There have been a number of underground ways the Administration has continued a liberal march without much attention, manipulating the bureaucracy and advancing its agenda by stealth. If declaring the end of ``the era of big government'' is the Clinton Administration by day, this is it by night.
<P>
Take RU-486. Abortion is one of the issues on which Clinton can't leave the Left -- despite the ``rare'' rhetoric -- so he was eager to deliver on the ``abortion pill.'' In January of 1993 Clinton wrote HHS Secretary Donna Shalala -- FDA Commissioner David Kessler's boss -- a memo asking HHS to promote the ``testing, licensing, and manufacturing'' of the drug. Kessler had pre-emptively reacted to the pressure five weeks after the 1992 elections, unilaterally reversing Bush Administration policy. He wrote to RU-486's manufacturer, Roussel Uclaf, prodding it to apply for approval in the U.S. (``further clinical trials may not be required,'' he added helpfully). Everybody all around got the hints -- Kessler doing Clinton's bidding to save his job, Roussel Uclaf doing Kessler's bidding to avoid future run-ins. RU-486 is slated for FDA approval as early as September, and the Clinton Administration will have provided America with the drug as surely as if it had sponsored legislation to do so. 
<P>
<font size=+3>F</font><font size=+1>EDERAL</font> departments, meanwhile, have become touchstones for the organized Left and agents for advancing a PC agenda otherwise seen only on college campuses. The EPA, for instance, is a breeding ground for self-perpetuating activism. Since 1993, according to a GAO report, grants awarded for workshops, conferences, and non-scientific studies -- mostly the province of environmental advocacy groups -- have nearly doubled, from roughly $130 million to about $250 million. The American Association of Retired Persons has received some $40 million in 23 different grants since 1993; the Environmental Defense Fund has grabbed $1.8 million. Meanwhile, despite an amendment to the Family and Medical Leave Act introduced by Sen. Don Nickles (R., Okla.) stipulating that it wouldn't apply to domestic partners, the EPA includes domestic partners in its own leave plan. EPA chief Carol Browner proudly cited the policy in an e-mail celebrating June as Gay and Lesbian Pride Month -- ``In Headquarters, and in some Regional Offices, activities are being organized by the Chapters of the Gay, Lesbian, or Bisexual Employees (GLOBE) of EPA. Please join them . . .''
<P>
More broadly, the Administration has made full use of the propaganda power of the executive branch (see Christina Hoff Sommers, next page). The Civil Service subcommittee of the House Reform and Oversight Committee under Rep. John Mica (R., Fla.) has documented an Administration effort to ``roll out'' a weekly message through the public-affairs offices of federal departments, including those in field offices nationwide. (Veterans Affairs, Labor, and the EPA seem to be heavily involved.) ``It's putting hundreds of government employees at work flacking for you all over the country,'' says a House aide. House Reform and Oversight Committee Chairman Bill Clinger (R., Penn.) conducted a May hearing on the Administration's wide-ranging politicization of the federal bureaucracy: 
<P>
<blockquote>
 -- VA Secretary Jesse Brown included a long ``message'' on employees' check stubs. ``As I have been telling the nation's veterans organizations this summer,'' Brown wrote, ``the Administration's [budget] plan is much better for veterans and their families.''
<P>
 -- In February 1995 an internal EPA e-mail discussed how ``Enviros are looking for some help in the conference committee on unfunded mandates,'' and suggested what the agency could do to support their lobbying. 
<P>
 -- A state director of the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Land Management wrote a letter last year advising public-land constituents of the department's opposition to a GOP grazing bill and inviting them ``to come together to work for the health of the public lands and the long-term economic stability of the West.'' Cabinet Secretaries can certainly take positions on public issues, but their departments aren't supposed to be arms of a permanent political campaign.</blockquote> 
<P>
Unions have been an integral part of this campaign too. Federal public-employee unions were kept apprised of crucial early strategy meetings organized by the Treasury Department to prepare for the looming budget crisis in 1995 (the meetings, again, were uncovered by Saxton's Joint Economic Committee). Ordinarily, public-employee unions would be concerned about a government shutdown and Treasury's planned raid on their pension trust funds during it. Instead, the unions eagerly participated in the Administration's shut-down strategy. ``We will be '<B>ON THEIR CASE AND IN THEIR FACE</B>,''' the American Federation of Government Employees president wrote of GOP freshmen in an August 1995 letter to members, well in advance of any shutdown. ``The question is not whether we work, but in what kind of America we will work.'' The Administration has paid back the unions for their loyalty. The Office of Personnel Management provided names and home addresses of its employees -- a clear breach of their privacy -- to the unions representing them. Mica's subcommittee discovered an OMB letter confirming that other federal agencies would be doing the same. 
<P>
There is a certain virtuosity to all this. The Democrats simply are more comfortable with power than the Republicans. That's why the Clinton Administration can -- after some initial stumbles -- push and pull all the political levers like an expert lathe operator. Two other factors are at work as well. One is necessity. The political imperative in the current environment is to move, as Ralph Reed once famously said of the Christian Coalition, ``quietly, with stealth, under cover of night.'' The other is lack of scruple. The Administration reflects the Clintons' ruthlessness in pursuit of power. The theme of former Republican officials brought to Capitol Hill to testify on Clinton Administration practices is always: We never would have done that, we couldn't have gotten away with it. Well, for whatever reason, the Clinton Administration can. For Republicans, the reward for their virtue is in heaven. The reward for the Clintonites' shamelessness may well be in a second term.

<FONT SIZE=+3>F</FONT><font size=+1>OUNDED</font> in 1989, Ervin and Associates, a contracting firm based in Bethesda, Md., and specializing in affordable housing, more than tripled in size in its first five years. In July, 1994 its work was commended by Assistant Secretary for Housing Nicholas Retsinas in testimony before the House Subcommittee on Employment, Housing, and Aviation. Following the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, the company raised over $165,000 to help the families of HUD employees who lost their lives. On John Ervin's office wall hangs a framed picture of his staff with HUD Secretary Henry Cisneros to mark the occasion, and a letter from the Secretary notes, ``The HUD family will always be grateful for your kindness.''
<P>
Well, maybe not ``always.'' Ervin has filed a suit against the department claiming its rampant politicization is running him out of business. Specifically, Ervin charges that the head of HUD's housing division, Helen Dunlap, has steered lucrative federal contract awards -- known by industry types as ``honey pots'' -- to her ``contractors of choice,'' in keeping with her animus against white males. Since Miss Dunlap's political appointment in 1994, Mr. Ervin's federal contacts have been cut almost in half, and the firm has had to downsize its full-time staff from 47 to 23. Moreover, Ervin claims, HUD's employment practice reflects an institutional bias. HUD counters that Ervin is a ``disgruntled contractor'' and that safeguards prevent contract patronage. His suit is pending in D.C.'s district court, but briefs filed by Ervin and documents he has obtained from HUD highlight disturbing practices -- blatant hiring quotas, outright hostility to white males, and possibly favoritism in contracts -- that go unnoticed in the thicket of the federal bureaucracy. 
<P>
Mr. Ervin asserts he has been recommended for many contracts by so-called source evaluation boards -- panels of career civil servants that are meant to combat patronage -- only to see Helen Dunlap ``orchestrate'' efforts to ``bypass the normal procurement processes which are intended to prevent the very abuses'' Ervin is being subjected to. In one case, Ervin alleges Miss Dunlap awarded a $30-million asset-management contract to the purportedly ``disadvantaged'' firm Williams and Adley, breaching a prior contract which Ervin says HUD previously informed him was legally his. Following objections raised by Ervin and career housing-division employees, according to <I>Housing Affairs Letter</I>, the HUD inspector general launched an investigation into contract malfeasance by the housing division. Miss Dunlap was demoted from her political appointment as Deputy Assistant Secretary for Multifamily Housing to Deputy Assistant Secretary for Housing Operations.
<P>
Despite this, Helen Dunlap reportedly waged a power struggle with her replacement (a white male), holding duplicate staff meetings immediately after his and asserting that she was still in charge and didn't intend to surrender. And she apparently won; she inexplicably regained her jurisdiction over contract awards and, Mr. Ervin claims, vindictively blackballs his firm from obtaining such awards. ``They throw the fox out of the hen house and then let it back in,'' says Ervin.
<P>
This attitude carries over into the way Miss Dunlap manages her division. <I>Housing Affairs Letter</I> quotes one high-level HUD source who says Dunlap ``made many enemies after joining the department.'' According to anonymous moles in HUD, she refers to the men in her front office as ``TOMs,'' or ``Tired Old Males,'' and has said that ``the only fitting position for a male is a secretary.'' It is not without reason that some of these career employees have been known to call their office a ``white boys' hell.''
<P>
But discrimination is not confined to Helen Dunlap and HUD contracts. Department managers are ranked on how well they achieve cultural diversity within their divisions. They are given evaluations with ratings of Outstanding, Fully Successful, and Unacceptable; an ``outstanding'' manager ``takes actions and makes decisions regarding hiring, promotions, training, upward mobility, recommendations for selection, and other personnel or administrative matters that further the Department's . . . Affirmative Employment Program policies and foster diversity within the HUD workplace.'' In short, color over merit.
<P>
Internal hiring data obtained by John Ervin under the Freedom of Information Act indicate what close attention is paid to ``diversity.'' A chart produced by HUD breaks down each department division by race and gender, noting changes over a six-month cycle. From September 1995 to March 1996, for example, Miss Dunlap's Office of Housing severely cut white men from the better professional and administrative positions (professionals down 10 per cent compared to 1 per cent department-wide).
<P>
In a previous analysis by HUD for 1996, the department reported a ``manifest imbalance'' (representation ``substantially below'' the civilian labor force) within its housing division in professional Hispanic females, and administrative and technical white females. An accompanying chart entitled ``Internal Movement Numerical Objectives'' called for 90 ``planned'' division hirings -- 20 white females, 20 black females, 20 black males, 10 Hispanic males, 10 Hispanic females, 5 Asian males, and 5 Asian females. Figures for white males were nil.
<P>
What is most striking, however, is not that HUD uses quotas in its hiring and promotions, but that the basis for these quotas in divisions across the country appears to be the Civilian Labor Force statistics for Washington, D.C. That is, a district field office in, say, Kansas City must strive to reflect the demographic composition of D.C. workers (the city's population is over 70 per cent minority). Kansas City's HUD field office has a total of five employees at the professional level: three white males, two black males. In a HUD document titled ``Assessment of Underrepresentation,'' the department categorizes all employees by race and gender and suggests in a ``number needed'' column that Kansas City should hire two white women, two black women, and a male and female each of Hispanic, Asian, and American Indian derivation.
<P>
Interestingly, in every assessment of white-male underrepresentation spanning HUD's 10 regions and 79 field offices, there is no ``number needed'' advisement for more white males.
<P>
While Nelson Diaz, head of HUD's office of General Counsel, mandates an obligatory three-and-a-half hour ``sensitivity training'' seminar for his employees, he apparently could use a little of this himself. According to attendees at a September 22, 1993, meeting of field counsel, Mr. Diaz declared that there are ``too many white faces at HUD.'' Subsequently, attempts were made to remove John Dellera (who is white) as Assistant General Counsel for New York/New Jersey. ``I doubted that the reassignment was bona fide and suspected it was an unlawful attempt to coerce my resignation so that Nelson could appoint some political friend to the job,'' Dellera wrote friends. Diaz replaced Dellera with a female Hispanic -- the office was deficient in the Hispanic female professional category, according to HUD reports. 
<P>
If the department isn't violating the letter of the law after the Supreme Court's <I>Adarand</I> decision -- which held that race preferences will receive ``the strictest judicial scrutiny'' and will ``seldom provide a relevant basis for disparate treatment'' -- it certainly violates the spirit. Not that it seems to matter. A May 16, 1996 HUD report dismisses the decision: ``<I>Adarand</I> did not provide clear judicial precedent on the constitutionality of specific affirmative action/ set-aside programs.'' Until the Supreme Court more clearly defines its guidelines, John Ervin just hopes to stay in the black -- despite being a white male trying to do business with Helen Dunlap's HUD.

<FONT SIZE=+3>I</FONT><font size=+1>N THE</font> novel <I>Primary Colors</I>, a senior Democratic senator is having an interview with the Bill Clinton figure, called Jack Stanton. It is well along in 1992, after the revelations about Gennifer Flowers and the record of evading the draft. The senior statesman does not know quite what to make of this precocious candidate, who carries about him the pronounced scent of things disreputable. Stanton is good with ``the folks'' -- he thrives on the engagement with ordinary people in a campaign. And he makes a ``nice speech.'' But then the senator turns and says, ``I have never seen a politician carry so much trouble around with him. You're like that cartoon character . . . Pigpen. A permanent cloud of dirt follows him around.''
<P>
Or as the Greeks would have it, character is destiny. Bill Clinton's permanent cloud was no accident; it sprang from something in his character. And when that something was conveyed into the work of a new Administration, it produced the surprises that should have been, by then, no surprise: an Administration that took, as the defining measures of its first moments, positions its leaders had never acknowledged in public or sought to justify in the course of the campaign. A candidate who had offered himself as a New Democrat, more sensitive on social issues, took as his first dramatic initiative an advanced position on gay rights, including gays in the military. A candidate who had lamented abortions, with a vow to make them ``rare'' as well as legal, moved on his first day in office -- in fact, moved even before he was sworn in -- to sign executive orders that would sweep away every inhibition on abortion in the federal service. The subsequent stories of Whitewater and Travelgate, of billing records curiously lost and rediscovered, of thuggish aides commandeering files from the FBI -- all of it plays out the script of characters straining their meager wit at the project of concealment rather than the task of governing. Indeed, it might be said that the project of concealment was what knitted this team together as its binding purpose. The first thing that must be understood then about Bill Clinton and the bully pulpit is that his Administration was constituted on premises that could not be expressed in public; and the principal genius of his staff was expended in covering up the incidents in his past that would imperil his moral claim to govern.
<P>
In June of 1993, I was at dinner with a seasoned Republican congressman, a man much liked on both sides of the aisle, and he remarked that, after the first, rocky months of Clinton's Presidency, his constituents had seen through him. Or they saw him clearly as he was. And what, I asked, did they see? ``That he is a man who will lie to them,'' he said, ``as readily as he will look at them.'' Three years later, when a jury in Little Rock handed down the first convictions of people close to the Clintons, a young reporter could remark on television that this event, though jolting, would have no measurable effect on the public standing of the President. For the public, he said, had long ago ``discounted'' Mr. Clinton's veracity. That is to say, a large portion of the public has absorbed now, with a serene acceptance, that Bill Clinton is an affable, incorrigible liar, but they have concluded that nothing in his vices threatens any public harm. In one recent survey, about 54 per cent of the public did not think that Bill Clinton could be considered ``honest and trustworthy.'' But the same surveys also reported that about 62 per cent think he has honesty and integrity enough to serve as President. There has evidently been a scaling down. The public has apparently absorbed those premises that were the hallmarks of ``modernity'': that there may be a separation between politics and morality, between private character and public office, and that a man overflowing with vices may nevertheless have considerable virtues as a public man.
<P>
<font size=+3>I</font><font size=+1>T</font> became the standard refrain for a while among the Democrats that Clinton's personal life had nothing to do with his competence to deal with his public functions. But that argument quietly evaporated when Paula Jones filed her suit over sexual harassment. For since the outcry over Anita Hill in 1991, it had become a staple of the Left that sexual harassment deserved to be treated seriously, as a wrong claiming a high place in the public concern. With that sentiment kindling, there was a willingness to call forth the indignation of the public when the accusations broke over Sen. Bob Packwood. But when Paula Jones filed her own complaint, the Democrats were compelled to fall mute. They could no longer rail against Packwood and insist on the high significance of his offenses without sharpening the accusation against their own sitting President. It remained for Packwood to be removed from office by an Ethics Committee dominated by his own party. But the experience was quite enough to establish that Clinton's ``private'' conduct had a deeper public resonance after all. The need to defend Clinton induced his party to recede from an issue that it regarded as central, not peripheral, to the public business. His private troubles did indeed disarm or impair his party in addressing what it thought to be public matters of moral consequence.
<P>
Yet, as Madison said, if men were angels there would be no need for government. And a public steeped in Christianity has made its allowances for the sinful. (An echo sounds from a lyric of Stephen Sondheim: ``And as for being saintly, even faintly . . . no. But who needs Albert Schweitzer when the lights are low?/And oh, oh, oh, can that boy f -- oxtrot.'') At times it may indeed be true that the people needed urgently in a public mission are not virtuous in all things. That Churchill and Grant were heavy drinkers did not diminish the public need for them when their personal gifts marked them out for a mission that they, distinctly, could perform. If an inspired political man was able to summon the support of the public for a policy of putting abortion ``in the course of extinction,'' the pro-lifers would not be likely to desert him, if it turned out that his private life showed embarrassing lapses. And on the other side, we should not be shocked that the people who are determined to preserve unconstrained rights of abortion in America are quite as determined to cling to Bill Clinton even though his personal life could sustain, by itself, the tabloids at the supermarket.
<P>
<font size=+3>A</font><font size=+1>LL</font> of that we understand. And all of that we could readily grant: If we could accept Clinton's public purposes, we too might be able to share an urbane laugh over his character. But in his case there is a precise connection between his character and the political culture he represents: his personal libertinism reflects the core of what can be taken these days as liberal jurisprudence -- the notion of the ``autonomous self,'' unencumbered by moral restraints, which seeks, as its first freedom, sexual freedom, and as its primary legal support, the right to an abortion. In the ``culture war,'' the moral tradition is set against the ethic of that class that now controls the media, the universities, and the courts; and for all his faults, Bill Clinton is the exquisite reflection of that ethic and that class. In what other Administration could we find a highly placed officer, the deputy general counsel at the Department of Health and Human Services, advancing the proposal for gay marriage, because it would ``expose and denaturalize the historical construction of gender at the heart of marriage''? A biped who makes these sounds can find its habitat only in a Democratic Administration. The Left on the campuses may wince when Clinton glides with the public wind and rejects gay marriage. But they are tolerant of his political weaving because they understand that he could never have been elected as a man of the modern American Left.
<P>
That difference, between the character of Clinton's policies and the character of his public rhetoric, is the measure of his considerable skill as a political man. He presides over an Administration of the post-McGovern Democrats, yet all that is happily overlooked by Middle America as he plays, with a flourish, on the chords of conventional morality. But how does he do it? How is he believable even for a moment when he strikes moral poses and presumes to engage in moral teaching?
<P>
``It should not fly, but behold! It does fly.'' He should have not the slightest standing to teach anything of moral consequence in public; and yet: he stands and he teaches. Indeed, the logic of his situation is that he cannot do otherwise without appearing defensive and giving the game away. One observer pointed out that Clinton was raised in a gambling town, where he learned early on the art of bluffing, or presenting the ``poker face.'' With his record, he is the last person to be preaching to young people about the virtues of chastity, and yet he preaches. As a man who evaded his obligations to serve in the military, it is clear that he cannot summon the least moral authority to send anyone else into combat. But of course, as Commander-in-Chief, he must be able to do just that. And his strength as a public man seems to reside precisely in his cheekiness, his unflagging willingness to brazen it out.
<P>
It is remarked, of course, that Franklin Roosevelt presided over a global war even though he himself had never served in the military. And among present-day Republicans, Dick Cheney and Phil Gramm did not serve, though they were of age during the war in Vietnam. Still, there is something different about a man who used every stratagem to avoid his obligation. There is a moral point here that deserves to be respected even by people who feel an affinity with Clinton over Vietnam: There is a kind of covenant society must have with the men who honored the claims of their own government, and accepted their obligation to serve in the military. They accepted those duties at a certain hazard to themselves, and many of them died. In the aftermath, we may have good reason to wish we had sent none of them into a war that did not command the conviction of the leaders who were directing it. But part of the covenant with the men who served -- to use language closer to the ground -- is that we don't make jerks of them. And that we emphatically do when we show a willingness to honor a man who prospered because he was not foolish enough to risk himself as they did. A public that elects Clinton is engaging in a gesture of contempt for the men who served, and veterans who voted for him are engaging in a gesture of self-contempt.
<P>
<font size=+3>B</font><font size=+1>UT</font> gamely putting all of that aside, what was Clinton to teach as he took hold of the bully pulpit? What was left? Could we imagine the scene as it must have been at Yale, over twenty years ago, as Bill Clinton, Robert Reich, and their friends would stay up in bull sessions, flexing their powers of conjecture, pondering the ways in which they might lead the country into bold paths of reform once the levers of power were put in their hands, as surely they would be? Could we imagine the moment of insight? ``We are going to come out against children smoking!'' Or: ``We are going to come out against dead-beat dads!'' Or: ``We are going to come out, forthrightly, unequivocally, against violence, and especially against the freedom to shoot people with assault weapons!''
<P>
That could hardly have been the vision that marked their dreams. But it may be the only recipe that is available to the generation that resolved long ago that there were no transcendent moral truths, particularly any truths grounded in ``nature.'' This group can rise to moral teaching mainly by sounding the themes of public pieties, with proposals so wanting in controversy that they would mesh even with the social policies of Joseph Goebbels and his party. They too had an ambitious scheme of allowances for children, and they were headed by a man who was an exemplary figure to the young in his shunning of tobacco. Still, even in this domain, the authority of Mr. Clinton must be equivocal. When he enjoins upon teenagers a life of chastity and abstinence, it clearly cannot be because he would respect that life in principle. In fact, it is hard to see why Mr. Clinton would not approach the problem of teenage smoking in the way that his Administration approaches teenage sexuality: After all, some youngsters will be determined to smoke anyway, as some youngsters will be determined to have sexual relations, and so we might as well provide them with cigarettes containing filter tips.
<P>
But of course even the health of children reaches its limit as a moral concern when it runs up against the interests of Mr. Clinton's core constituency. The President's solicitousness for children may be nearly maternal, but it evaporates dramatically when it comes to those children, with legs dangling out of the birth canal, who are the targets of ``partial-birth'' abortions. That children may become hooked on nicotine has become, for Mr. Clinton, a high public concern. That they may have their skulls crushed and their brains suctioned out, if it suits the interests or ``mental health'' of the women bearing them, is an injury that does not register. For in the presence of a trumping political interest, that infant simply does not register as a real being, capable of sustaining pain.
<P>
In the meantime, the editors of the <I>Wall Street Journal</I> carefully unfold, over several years, the record of Whitewater, the Rose Law Firm, Webster Hubbell, Filegate. What is revealed is the pattern the editors characterize as ``Arkansas mores.'' The academic degrees may be from Yale, but the style of politics and moral fastidiousness is really Dogpatch U.S.A. But even the editors, worldly as they are, begin to show their puzzlement: The record unfolds and deepens, and yet it triggers no moral outrage in the public. That absence of reaction may itself be the news: namely, that we are dealing with a public shaped now by the changes of the Sixties and the public teaching of <I>Roe</I> v. <I>Wade</I>. This may be a public coarsened now in its moral sensibility; and there may be nothing any longer in Clinton's repertoire that could stir this public to outrage.
<P>
We may well recall that old joke about the lawyer who is promised unbounded success in business and love, to be paid for in the end by the delivery of his soul. And he asks, guardedly, ``What's the catch?'' The accomplishment of Bill Clinton is that he has made the country into one large lawyer-joke. Clinton has marked off the record of an incorrigible liar, faithless to his wife, who cannot be trusted to honor any law beyond his own interest -- and the public says, ``Yes -- but what is the problem?''
<P>
And yet, it may be said on behalf of Mr. Clinton that he is one of the few men on the scene who is suited to the political pulpit, because he is possessed of the most genuine interest in engaging people, wherever he finds them, and joining the argument. On the Republican side he is matched by the likes of Phil Gramm, Bill Bennett, and Pat Buchanan. And when Mr. Clinton goes to church, one has the hunch that he goes because he knows he needs it. But his comings and goings in church also seem to offer another measure of the religious sensibility of our time. Apparently, the religious sense abroad in the land is of a God whose capacity for forgiveness is boundless, and whose demand for contrition is optional. What seems to be left out, conspicuously, is a God who would invite some serious testimony about the plan to amend one's life and confirm it in a new cast. If that understanding of God were dominant in the public mind, people might be moved to ask of Bill Clinton some rather searching questions. But it may be as some of us have begun to suspect, that Mr. Clinton is indeed a representative man of his age. He is, as he is, scaled to the current moral sensibility of the public, and to the notion of God that most people in the country think they can afford.

<FONT SIZE=+3>I</FONT><font size=+1>N</font> his acceptance speech at the 1992 Democratic National Convention, Bill Clinton promised zero tolerance for those in government who ``cut corners and cut deals.'' But less than three years later the Justice Department cut a highly questionable deal with Arthur Coia, president of the mob-ridden Laborers International Union of North America, whose 700,000 members for the most part fill low-skilled construction jobs.
<P>
Corruption in the Laborers Union is an old and open book. As far back as 1978 a Justice Department report to the White House contended that the Chicago mob dominated Angelo Posco, then president of LIUNA, and in 1986 the President's Commission on Organized Crime, pointing to the looting of union benefit funds by the mob, death threats, and murders of opposing candidates, urged the Justice Department to file civil-racketeering charges. In 1988, the FBI announced a RICO investigation of LIUNA.
<P>
On November 4, 1994, the Justice Department delivered a draft of its 212-page RICO complaint to the Laborers: the key demand, Coia must go. The complaint chronicled a massive web of corruption that had continued for decades, with capos from an assortment of crime families either running locals directly or installing their appointees. LIUNA, it said, has been ``continuously and systematically controlled, exploited, and dominated in the conduct of its affairs by the Cosa Nostra.''
<P>
The complaint was unsparing concerning Coia personally. Four consecutive presidents of the union, including Coia, were ``controlled and influenced by organized-crime figures.'' Indeed, according to the complaint, Coia had tried (unsuccessfully) to replace the previous president in 1986 because he believed ``that [Angelo] Fosco's conduct harmed LIUNA and <I>the Cosa Nostra's control of LIUNA</I>'' (italics added). From 1986 to July 1994, the complaint charged, Coia had conspired with the Todaro crime family of Buffalo to transfer training funds of upstate New York locals to Buffalo, where the money would be used for the benefit of Cosa Nostra families and associates. (They were foiled when the victim-locals protested and a court upheld them against Coia.) Some of the material was old but nonetheless telling, like the 1981 indictment of Coia's father (who, as secretary-treasurer of the union, was second in command), New England mob boss Raymond Patriarca, and Coia himself for racketeering and taking bribes from an insurance swindler: it fizzled when the judge ruled the statute of limitations had expired.
<P>
Despite the damning indictment, within three months Justice had cut a deal: Coia could stay. In fact, Coia would be Justice's subcontractor to clean up the  union -- giving the ``appearance,'' in the delicate phrasing of Bill McCollum, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Crime, of putting the fox in charge of guarding the chicken coop. Why did Justice make such an unprecedented arrangement? The official explanation is that the government saved money that would otherwise have been wasted in lengthy litigation, and that Coia himself -- who was more knowledgeable? -- could root out the mob more efficiently. Indeed, Justice professed great pride in this pioneering method of dealing with union corruption, and Attorney General Janet Reno cited it as a model for future racket busting.
<P>
There is no doubt that Coia had wielded a canny combination of carrot and stick. He threatened an all-out fight in the courts if he personally were pushed out. Showing he meant business, he hired the firm of Williams & Connolly, which also represents President Clinton on Whitewater, to represent him in his negotiations with Justice. To represent LIUNA he hired Robert Luskin, himself a former Justice Department official. Luskin made an unusual offer on Coia's behalf: the union would hire him and a contingent of former FBI investigators to root out corruption. Moreover, Coia agreed to a consent decree acknowledging significant corruption in the union (which he had previously denied) that gave the Justice Department the option, until 1998, of putting LIUNA under trusteeship if it was not satisfied with Coia's progress.
<P>
Did Justice have other inducements to keep Coia in place? What has raised eyebrows is Coia's role as one of Clinton's most important political and financial allies. Coia has co-chaired a series of fund-raising dinners for the Democrats, each of which has raised millions of dollars. In 1994 alone, LIUNA contributed over a million dollars to Democratic candidates. It has become one of the largest donors of ``soft money'' to the Democratic Party. It even loaned $100,000 to Clinton's inaugural committee. Coia personally contributed $1,000 (the maximum permitted) to Clinton's Legal Defense Fund. He joined the board of the Back to Business Committee, where, humorously, he lent his moral authority to the committee's vigorous denials of merit in any of the ``character'' charges against the Clintons.
<P>
Money translated into social access. Soon the President and Coia were Bill and Arthur, eating breakfast together, exchanging gifts of specially made golf clubs. (The President's thank-you note for his arrived on Coia's desk the same day as the Justice Department's complaint.) Coia was invited to a small White House dinner where the President played the saxophone; a Judiciary subcommittee documented over 120 such contacts.
<P>
<font size=+3>D</font><font size=+1>ID</font> all this have any influence on the decision-making process at Justice? At hearings by Rep. McCollum's subcommittee at the end of July, Justice Department officials vigorously denied it and Democratic members of the committee indignantly insisted that there was absolutely no evidence of any White House interference.
<P>
Was there then only the <I>appearance</I> of a quid pro quo? Coia knew the Justice Department complaint was coming. There were obvious channels for a discreet phone call. The President and Coia were represented by the same law firm, and attorney - client privilege would forever protect such a channel of communications. Or Coia might have approached White House Deputy Chief of Staff Harold Ickes. According to Coia himself, the President had designated Ickes as his White House contact. Before taking his White House post, Ickes had represented a number of unions on mob-related charges, including the Laborers. Indeed the court-appointed trustee for a Teamsters local demanded that Ickes's firm withdraw as the local's counsel because of what it complained was its ``lack of independence'' from mob influence.
<P>
But even if there were no contacts between the White House and Justice, there did not have to be interference for there to be influence. Janet Reno's Justice Department has bent itself out of shape to be helpful to the President on Whitewater, Filegate, Travelgate, Paulagate. The political appointees at Justice could not but be sensitive to the President's friendship with Coia. Last week, Ronald Fino, for 16 years an FBI informant within the Laborers on the Cosa Nostra, speaking behind a protective screen, warned McCollum's subcommittee that you can no longer tell a mobster by his fedora hat. ``Projecting an image of goodness, popping up and chairing charitable fund-raising functions combined with a voice for social justice, the racketeer builds a formidable defense against the Justice Department and prosecution.''
<P>
However the decision was made, and whatever the merits of the agreement between Justice and LIUNA -- and it is too soon to tell whether Coia will truly clean up the union or merely get rid of mob rivals -- several things are clear, all of them disquieting.
<P>
<blockquote>
1. Coia had a tremendous victory as he was transformed overnight from accused racketeer to racket-busting pioneer. In effect now endorsed by the Justice Department, he is a sure winner in the union elections in September and is thus guaranteed control of LIUNA until well after 1998, when Justice loses its power to intervene if dissatisfied with Coia's ``progress.'' Significantly, under terms of the agreement, LIUNA's $1-billion pension fund, the pot of gold which had been the mob's chief target, is off limits to the team of investigators Coia agreed to hire. Reform in this area, U.S. Attorney James Burns acknowledges, is ``up to the union.''
<P>
2. The President continued to lend Coia the prestige of his public friendship (including 24 White House visits) <I>after</I> he had been warned about the forthcoming Justice Department complaint. At the McCollum hearings, documents were produced showing that the FBI wrote the White House counsel's office in 1994 that Coia ``is a criminal associate of the New England Patriarca organized crime family'' and the subject of an FBI criminal probe. Another Justice Department memo that same year referred to Mrs. Clinton's staff having been warned, on the occasion of her planning to speak at a LIUNA conference, that ``we plan to portray him as a mob puppet.'' (Undeterred, in early 1995, while Coia was still fighting off the complaint, Mrs. Clinton went to Florida to address LIUNA's conference, Coia proudly accompanying her.)
<br>
Kenneth Boehm of the National Legal and Policy Center, which focuses on ethical issues in government, says: ``The appearance problem is enormous here. In the case of a federal judge, a conflict of interest includes the appearance of a conflict of interest. The rationale is that the public should have confidence in its public institutions. If the President allows himself to be seen with a figure like this, it is a betrayal of public trust.''
<P>
3. Even as the Justice Department was chronicling the mob's wholesale pillaging of LIUNA's pension and training funds, departments of the Federal Government were providing the union with millions of dollars for ``training and education.'' A current study by the Heritage Foundation finds that in fiscal 1994 the EPA, HUD, Education, Labor, and Health and Human Services between them gave over $11 million to LIUNA, most of it as ``training funds.'' Bizarrely, the Department of Labor, in its annual Inspector General report, cites the prosecution of Michael LaBarbara for stealing training funds from a LIUNA local, while at the same time LIUNA received $475,000 more in, yes, training grants. The taxpayer hardly anticipates that government agencies will be showering discretionary funds on people with colorful nicknames.
<P>
One of the documents released by the McCollum committee shows just how far Coia thought he could go. At Coia's behest Democratic National Committee Chairman Don Fowler sent a memo to both Harold Ickes, who oversees the Clinton campaign from the White House, and Debra DeLee, chief executive of the 1996 Democratic convention, urging them to consider giving Coia a speaking role at that convention.</blockquote>
<P>
Sorry, folks. With all the publicity, he won't be at the podium.

<FONT SIZE=+3>A</FONT> <font size=+1>FIRST</font> defense of Clinton partisans against new revelations of corruption, illegality, and general wrongdoing in the Whitewater scandal is to point out that it all occurred a long time ago, before Mr. Clinton was elected President. By implication if not overtly, Mr. Clinton's behavior as President is held to be above suspicion.
<P>
Unfortunately for the tactic, the Clintons seem to attract scandal the way Newt Gingrich attracts controversy. And this tendency didn't stop with Whitewater. Here is a brief list of Clinton scandal since Inaugural Day 1993:
<P>
<B>Filegate:</B> The President's director of personnel security, Craig Livingstone, was caught collecting <I>hundreds</I> of secret FBI files on Reagan and Bush Administration officials. President Clinton, who disclaims familiarity with the facts, nonetheless asserts that this was merely ``a bureaucratic snafu.'' FBI director Louis Freeh -- whose agency complied with the White House's extraordinary requests for these files -- calls it a ``massive'' and ``egregious'' violation of privacy rights. Prosecutors and Congress want to know, among other things, who hired Livingstone and whether he acted on his own, as White House spokesmen claim. Two FBI special agents assigned to the White House insist they were told that Hillary Clinton was Livingstone's patron. While the First Lady has a finger in most White House appointments, including the chef, chief usher, head of the correspondence unit, and Secret Service detail, she denies any association with Livingstone. Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr will have to sort this out. He will probably invite Mrs. Clinton to testify a second time, under oath, before the grand jury.
<P>
<B>State Department files:</B> The first time Clinton officials were found rifling through files was at the State Department; 160 personnel files of former Bush officials were collected, and disparaging information from two of the files was leaked to the <I>Washington Post</I>. The State Department's inspector general found that this conduct probably violated the Privacy Act. He referred the case to Attorney General Janet Reno for possible criminal prosecution. Miss Reno chose not to pursue the matter.
<P>
<B>Travelgate:</B> The first time Clinton officials misused the FBI was when they concocted criminal charges against the director of the White House Travel Office, Billy Dale. This was done to throw lucrative government travel business to two of the Clintons' Hollywood friends and campaign supporters. Dale, who had worked for Republican and Democratic Presidents, was forced to spend $500,000 on his defense. He was eventually prosecuted on charges of embezzlement by the Clinton Justice Department, but found not guilty after less than two hours of jury deliberation. Independent Counsel Starr is looking into whether former presidential aide David Watkins lied to government investigators to cover up Mrs. Clinton's role in the Travel Office firings. Watkins's own notes show that the First Lady ordered the firings, but Mrs. Clinton has told investigators she had no role in them. Again, she can be expected to give sworn testimony about this to the grand jury.
<P>
<b>The Clinton Cabinet:</B> The Clintons are not the only Administration officials being investigated by an independent counsel. Former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy, who was forced to resign, is under investigation for allegedly taking bribes from Tyson Foods, Inc., the giant Arkansas poultry company. Of course, the Tysons have been prominent supporters of Mr. Clinton's political career. Moreover, Tyson Foods' top lawyer, James Blair, helped Mrs. Clinton turn a $1,000 cattle-futures investment into $100,000 in less than a year. (Mrs. Clinton originally claimed that her superior financial skills were learned from the pages of the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>; in truth, this remarkable investment has never been fully explained.)
<P>
An independent counsel is investigating whether HUD Secretary Henry Cisneros lied to the FBI during his background investigation about the size and number of payments he made to his former mistress. And before his tragic death, Commerce Secretary Ron Brown was being investigated for, among other things, possible financial irregularities.
<P>
<B>The Clinton Sub-Cabinet:</B> Former Associate Attorney General Webster Hubbell -- Mrs. Clinton's former partner in the Rose Law Firm -- is now imprisoned at Cumberland Federal Penitentiary. He was convicted of defrauding some of his clients. Former White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum resigned after he interfered with Justice Department lawyers' efforts to search the late Vince Foster's office. Former Associate White House Counsel William Kennedy resigned over tax problems and his role in the Travel Office firings. Former Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger Altman and former Treasury General Counsel Jean Hanson resigned after it was learned that they had tipped off the President's staff that the Resolution Trust Corporation was sending criminal referrals involving the Clintons to the Justice Department.
<P>
<B>Health Care Task Force:</B> As head of the task force, Mrs. Clinton insisted that the group's meetings be closed to all but six hundred carefully selected government and industry officials who shared her goal of nationalizing America's health-care system. Mrs. Clinton and the task force were sued by three organizations claiming that the secret meetings violated the Federal Advisory Committee Act. A federal court agreed. Moreover, during the litigation, the presiding judge, Royce Lamberth, became concerned that certain Administration officials may have provided false and misleading information to the court. Judge Lamberth is currently considering whether to bring sanctions against any of these officials.
<P>
<B>Paula Jones:</B> Paula Jones's allegations of sexual harassment by Bill Clinton go back before his Presidency. But his legalistic contortions to evade a trial are a minor scandal in themselves. Incidentally, the Clinton lawyer who alleged that Billy Dale's willingness to have his lawyers plea-bargain was a sign of guilt might want to ponder the fact that the President's lawyers held negotiations with Paula Jones's team on the terms under which she would withdraw her suit. Mr. Clinton maintains that the Constitution immunizes him from civil suits involving allegations of personal misconduct that occurred before he became President. Of course, no such immunity exists. At one time Mr. Clinton claimed immunity as a member of the armed forces. Public outcry caused him to beat a quick retreat from that argument. Recently the Supreme Court agreed to consider the President's immunity claim, thereby delaying the case until after the election.
<P>
<B>Whitewater:</B> While Whitewater per se occurred before the Clintons came to Washington, actions that look like cover-up attempts have taken place in the White House. Last summer, for example, critical Rose Law Firm billing records, containing information about Mrs. Clinton's apparent legal work on the Castle Grande real-estate scam, were discovered outside the First Lady's personal office in the White House residence. The records, sought by lawmen since 1994, were not turned over until this January. Mrs. Clinton has steadfastly denied providing legal advice on Castle Grande. Furthermore, she denies knowing the whereabouts of the long-sought billing records prior to their discovery. Mrs. Clinton was required to give her testimony to the grand jury this January. Since then, the FBI found her fingerprints on the records.

For Immediate Release:
<p>
October 23, 
1996<p>
<B><center> Small Business Group Asks Who Actually 
Possesses the Home Field Advantage in Health
Insurance?
</B></center>
<hr>
<P>
<P>
Washington, D.C. &#173;&#173; The Small Business Survival Committee
(SBSC), a small business advocacy group with more than 40,000
members across the nation, questioned the validity of Blue Cross
and Blue Shield's assertions in Michigan and across the country
that they operate under a clear disadvantage compared with other
insurance firms.<BR>

<P>
SBSC President Karen Kerrigan declared: &quot;Blue Cross and Blue
Shield is excluded from the one of the biggest hurdles to success
that any for&#173;profit enterprise faces: taxes.&quot;  <BR>

<P>
SBSC noted that according to reports from the Michigan State Treasurer's
Office, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Michigan (BCBSM) possessed
an $83 million tax advantage in 1995 by not having to pay state
property and single business taxes.<BR>

<P>
BCBSM has turned up the volume on its &quot;level playing field&quot;
offensive as groups opposed to the extreme pre&#173;existing condition
language in H.B. 5572, the Patient Bill of Rights, have cried
foul.  Specifically, the provision would require that no group
health insurance plan can ever exclude for a pre&#173;existing
condition, not even if no prior coverage existed.  According to
SBSC, this will drive up costs, push insurers out of the state,
and government would step in further.<BR>

<P>
SBSC Chief Economist Raymond J. Keating added: &quot;As baseball's
New York Yankees have shown thus far by losing two home games
and winning one on its opponents turf in the World Series, it's
often quite difficult to detect who, if anyone, clearly benefits
from the home field advantage.  The same can be said of the health
insurance field.  Clearly, Blue Cross and Blue Shield gains from
its tax status."

<CENTER><B>Big Labor: Biggest Losers of '96
Elections<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
The Small Business Survival (SBS) Foundation released
a report Oct. 31 asking the question, "Will
Sweeney Sink or Save Labor?"
 The new report concludes: "Under
AFL-CIO President John Sweeney, big labor will be a big loser."
<P>
The report lays out the long decline of labor union
membership and the increasing share of government employees in
labor union ranks.  SBS Foundation forecasts, based on recent
trends, that public-sector employees account for 42% of union
membership, up from a mere 6% in 1960.  As a percent of private
and public workforces, private-sector union membership is in free
fall, while public-sector unionism has stagnated for several years.
<P>
"This trend is not lost on union leaders like Sweeney,"
says SBS Foundation president Karen Kerrigan.  "Big
labor's
massive campaign against Republican members of Congress who favored
spending restraint and market-based policies are antithetical
to the labor movement's
need for coercive government to assist in their organizing efforts,
while propping up their relevancy.  With Republicans keeping control
of Congress, big labor's
failed efforts to reelect a Democrat majority will go down in
history as one of the most wasteful and unsuccessful political
campaigns of the twentieth century.  Labor leaders should have
focused on the task at hand:
building membership and representing the authentic concerns of
its members.  Sweeney is doing neither."
<P>
The report's
author, Raymond J. Keating, SBS Foundation Chief Economist, notes:
"In
an economy where entrepreneurship is on the rise, competition
is intensifying, and technological advancements are bringing about
further decentralization, big labor's
preferences for high taxes, excessive regulation, protectionism,
larger government, and class warfare make no sense.  In addition,
Sweeney's
strategic alignment with other groups in demise, like social activists
of the 1960s variety 
(socialists, left-wing academics, and various big-government groups)
 will only speed, rather than slow, the decline of labor unions.
 I guess misery does love company."

<CENTER><B>Calling a "Salt" a "Salt"
<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
The pernicious union corporate campaign tactic known
as salting was wounded recently by an administrative law judge
(ALJ) in San Francisco.  In a decision involving Irwin Industries,
the ALJ held that filing "frivolous,
knowingly false"
charges was "an
integral part of the . . . 'fight
back'
strategy that was contrived to force the company to spend substantial
amounts of money defending itself before the"
National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). 
<P>
The company had hired known Boilermakers Union organizers
in the past, but they had never been a target of "salting"
activity.  However, after an organizer was hired as a supervisor
on a new job, and asked to sign a statement that  asserted "I
am here for the best interest of IRWIN INDUSTRIES, INC. AND NOT
for the benefit of the [boilermakers] . . .," 
he initiated the campaign.
<P>
The organizer and his supporters engaged in a work
slowdown and were subsequently fired for that activity.  Afterwords
a busload of applicants appeared at the company office where they
filled out job applications and wrote the words "voluntary
organizers"
at the top.  The NLRB issued a complaint alleging unlawful discharges
against the organizer and his cohorts, and unlawful refusal to
hire the "volunteer
organizers."
<P>
The judge dismissed the complaint.  He went on to
recommend that the NLRB impose a remedy on the union which blocks
the future filing of bogus charges against the employer.<BR>
<P>

<CENTER><B>Sweeney's
Hangover<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
In a <I>Washington Times</I> piece today (November
6 1996) called "Wednesday
hangover,"
AFL-CIO Chief John Sweeney may have taken too much liberty with
rank-and-file dues.
<P>
According to the report:
<P>
<I>
". .class-action lawyers are looking into suing the AFL-CIO on
behalf of its members to return to them the $35 million in dues
that union President John Sweeney spent trying to elect a Democratic
House of Representatives.
<P>
Any such suit could cripple the AFL-CIO for years,
one legal expert suggests.
<P>
Ironically, class-action suits are lucrative for
lawyers and are protected by the liberal Democrats Mr. Sweeney
supports."</I>
<P>
It looks as though shrewd lawyers have figured out
that fewer lawsuit opportunities will be available as the GOP
will likely make another attempt at legal reform.  And with fewer
new regulations and rules being signed into law- 
as is expected to be the case with the new Congress-
why not go after labor unions?
<P>
<I>The massive partisan political campaign waged
against the GOP in the '96
elections, only resulted in 14 GOP freshmen scalps for John Sweeney.</I>

CALL TO ACTION: California's Proposition 65<p>
</b>
November 18, 1996<p>
Issue No. 23<BR>
<hr>
<P>
California's Proposition 65- State Initiatives with National Implications
<br>
</center>
<P>
An unresolved matter between federal OSHA and the
state of California is causing compliance uncertainity for a number
of chemical, paint and coating industries and is <U>certain to
impact any and all businesses that manufacture or distribute products
in California</U>. 
<P>
In 1986, California passed the Safe Drinking Water
and Toxic Enforcement Act (Proposition 65).  Prop 65  prohibits
businesses from knowingly and intentionally exposing individuals
to chemicals that cause cancer or reproductive toxicity without
posting clear and reasonable warnings.  Enforceable  by the California
Attorney General and private citizens groups, Prop 65 subjects
violators to a civil penalty of up to $2,500 a day.  
<P>
Under OSH Act, state specific standards must be federally
approved if they are to be applied to products used or distributed
in interstate commerce. OSH Act also requires that the state standards
not unduly burden interstate commerce.
<P>
The amendment- 
filed in January 1992-
to the California State OSH Plan to implement Prop 65 is pending
at the federal OSH Administration.  Yet, in spite of the fact
that OSHA has not acted on the California amendment, California
has allowed private citizen groups to file Prop 65 enforcement
actions.
<P>
Prop 65 places the burden of proving compliance on
the business. And now businesses that believed they were in compliance
with the federal and state requirements have become the victims
of citizen groups
lawsuits.  Suits have been filed against manufacturers of nail
polish, lead crystal, batteries, faucets, and spray paint.  
<P>
It's important to note that none of these lawsuits have been brought
by, or on the behalf of, industry employees. Because of litigation
costs, several of these suits were settled when companies either
agreed to abstain from selling their products in California, or
reformulate their product, or eliminate the Prop 65 listed substance
from the manufacturing process.
<P>
The large number of products and substances which
might require a Prop 65 warning substantially impacts manufacturers
and distributors of any products containing listed substances
sold in California.
<P>
In April 1995, a group of chemical manufacturers
filed a complaint with OSHA about California state administration
of the amendment.  Just recently (September 1996), the Department
of Labor just recently issued a request for comment on the California
State Standard on Hazard Communication incorporating Prop. 65.

<P>
Many issues including labeling requirements of products,
updating material safety data sheets, violiating the OSH Act and
fighting off "bounty
hunters"
need to be resolved.   <BR>
<P>
<CENTER><B>Standard 62R<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
Standard 62, adopted in 38 states and many local
building codes, sets ventilation requirements for office buildings,
commerical and institutional facilities, and residences.  
<P>
The revised version - Standard 62R - released by
the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning
Engineers (ASHRAE) is likely to impair the market for many products
manufactured by small companies and  increase operation and maintenance
costs.  
<P>
Standard 62R is likely to:
<P><ul>
<li>force products to be redesigned to satisfy new requirements
of indoor air quality.
<P>
<li>impose substantial paperwork burdens related to maintenance
of warehouses and offices.
<P>
<li>require small businesses to install  automatic heating,
ventilating and air conditioning controls.
<P>
<li>impair the market for manufactured products (carpet,
paint, upholstery.
<P>
<li>require emissions from manufactured products to satisfy
health-based standards.
<P>
<li>require small businesses to install and maintain
5 separate building ventiliation systems.
<P></ul>
<B>ASHRAE released the revised standard for public
comment; comments are due December 12, 1996.</b>

<h3>Karen Kerrigan</h3>
<hr width="35%" size="3">
</center>
<blockquote>Karen Kerrigan is president of the <a href="/sbsc/">Small Business Survival Committee</a> (SBSC), a nationwide nonprofit, nonpartisan small business advocacy organization fighting against unchecked government regulation and taxation on America's small business and entrepreneurial sector.  SBSC also works on efforts to reduce the size and scope of government, while promoting policies and reforms which foster economic growth and opportunity.
<P>
Ms. Kerrigan also serves as president of the Small Business Survival Foundation, a research and education organization that studies the impact of government policy on entrepreneurship and economic growth.
<P>
Ms. Kerrigan is a nationally recognized spokesperson on tax and budget issues, government waste, regulation, grassroots organizing, political activism, coalition building and other political and policy issues relating to reforming government at the local, state and federal levels.  She is an experienced and sought after speaker for business, political and community functions, and has led scores of seminars and programs on effective grassroots organizing.
<P>
Under Ms. Kerrigan's leadership, SBSC is looked to by the media for unique and bottom-line commentary and analysis on a wide range of political and economic issues.  SBSC's work and commentary has been cited by <i>Investor's Business Daily, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Times, The Washington Post, The New York Times, National Journal, Business Week, Entrepreneur, Fortune Magazine, Bloomberg Business New, The Boston Herald, The Philadelphia Inquirer, The Rush Limbaugh Show, The Michael Reagan Show</i> and hundreds of local newspapers and television news and radio programs nationwide.
<P>
Ms. Kerrigan has gained increased prominence in the 104th Congress through her stewardship of SBSC.  She has taken the organization from a small regional organization to a dynamic national group impacting the policy debates inside the nation's capitol.  The organization's unwavering principled stand on tax, budget and other issues has set it above the traditional business lobby in Washington.  
<P>
Ms. Kerrigan was formerly national field director of the Council for Citizens Against Government Waste (CCAGW) and <a href="/govt-waste/">Citizens Against Government Waste</a> (CAGW).  She directed the Taxpayer's Action Network (TAN) -- one of the most powerful and effective grassroots projects in America dedicated to making elected officials and government more accountable to taxpayers.  Ms. Kerrigan has provided consultation to hundreds of national, state and local organization on effective organizing, including United We Stand America during their formation.
<P>
Prior to joining CCAGW, Ms. Kerrigan was director of state projects and director of development for Citizens for a Sound Economy and Citizens for a Sound Economy Foundation.  As national director of development for consultation and training for the National Easter Seal Society, she directed the national fundraising programs and affiliate training.  Prior to joining the national headquarters, she served in key development positions within the states of New York and Georgia. 
<P>
Ms. Kerrigan is a native of New York.  She holds a B.A. degree in Politcal Science from the State University of New York College at Cortland.

<p>
Overhauling our nation's tax system ... pessimists say it will never happen -- optimists
simply claim they are in economic nirvana as the debate continues
to swirl around them. Not only has the national debate commenced,
but real pro- posals have been advanced and committee hearings
are already taking place in the United States Congress.
<p>
Every American taxpayer is impacted by the broken tax code. Small businesses
and entrepreneurs are particularly hard hit by our punishing,
complex system. The horde of taxes required of them from all levels
of government, com- pounded by the cost and burden of tax compliance,
and the fact that our perplex- ing system changes with the wind,
make the issue of taxation invariably the num- ber one concern
of small enterprises nationwide. 
<p>
Which of the leading tax overhaul proposals is the best system for America and small businesses
and entrepreneurs? The Small Business Survival Foundation (SBS
Foundation) is attempting to answer this question, as we study,
examine, analyze and criticize the various proposals as they become
more spe- cific, then overlay those proposals on the small business,
entrepreneurial sector for closer scrutiny. 
<p>
Over the next couple of years, the U.S. Congress will continue to debate which tax
system is best for America. As the "race to the White House" heats up, tax overhaul will become a central issue. 
<p>
One principle has become more solidified as the debate continues -- the entrepreneur
must remain at the core of our economic model. How to stoke the
entrepreneurial spirit must remain at the forefront of developing
a new tax sys- tem. The current U.S. tax code is a catastrophic
failure in this regard -- it punishes risk taking and entrepreneurship,
thus damaging economic growth and opportunity for all Americans.
<p>
The great tax debate has indeed just begun. It is exciting to
watch long-time allies of tax overhaul debating the merits of
each of the proposed systems. I am thrilled that this debate is
taking place. And, I remain optimistic that small businesses
and entrepreneurs -- the backbone of the American economy -- will,
in the end, be the winners of this long overdue revolution in our tax system.

<p>
 We are about to begin one of the most exciting, important debates in our his- tory -- what
kind of tax system we will have as we enter the 21st Century
and the Third Millennium. 
<p>
Public disgust with the current code grows and grows. Americans deeply resent a system which defies understanding, smothers growth, and invites corruption and manipulation.
<p>
Raymond Keating's short, lucid booklet couldn't be better timed.
It will enable concerned citizens to understand the essentials
of this upcoming debate. Keating quickly captures the flaws of
our tax system and then simply and fairly summarizes the alternatives
-- the flat tax, the national sales tax, the value-added tax
and the so-called consumed-income tax. 
<p>
The author's easy-to-understand checklist of criteria enables readers to see why the VAT and the consumed-income tax should be quickly discarded. The flat tax
and a national retail sales tax would both benefit the economy
and be a vast improvement over what we have now. At the end of
this booklet, Keating provides the two utopian versions of these
alternatives. Even if you think them unrealistic, they will make
you realize how truly "low-rated" a tax system can be!
<p>
This booklet will be an essential tool in stoking the debate.
The'96 election is absolutely critical. Unless voters have an
opportunity to give an unmistakable mandate for a fundamental
overhaul, an overhaul will not happen. Too many forces will oppose
it and gut it. Be wary of candidates who refuse to firmly advocate a specific alternative. Timidity, generalities, good intentions will be insufficient to bring about a true tax revolution. <p>
Personally, I am an unabashed advocate of the Dick Armey flat tax. There may
be better alternatives, but I believe it has the best chance to
win political approval next year. But this gets to the virtue
of this booklet -- it succinctly gives you the information you
need to make up your own mind and, just as importantly, to get
involved!

<p>
Entrepreneurs drive the economy. By creating and investing in new businesses, ideas, and innovations,
the entrepreneur ensures economic renewal and growth. While government
can assist this process by protecting life and limb and guaranteeing
property rights, government unfortunately more often than not
cre- ates obstacles to entrepreneurship and economic growth. Perhaps
the most for- midable of the many governmental obstacles thrown
in the path of entrepreneurs during this century has been the
U.S. federal income tax code. 
<p>
As constituted today, the federal income tax system amounts to a convoluted mess. It is complicated,
inefficient, intrusive, and serves as an impediment to entrepreneurship,
investment, economic growth, and job creation. 
<p>
In fact, only narrow
special interests, lobbyists, lawyers, and tax accountants can
derive any benefit from the current, complex income tax system.
Of course, the system can be largely attributed to their influence
peddling in our nation's organized interests, a complete overhaul
of our tax system has verged on fantasy for the past six to
seven decades - <i>until now</i>. 
<p>
"The Great Tax Debate" has arrived in Washington, D.C. A variety of tax overhaul proposals
are being given serious consideration not only in the many think
tanks that sprinkle Washington, D.C.'s urban landscape but in
the Halls of Congress. 
<p>
In the following pages, we shall examine
criteria for a sound tax system, review the main problems of our
current tax system, analyze alternative proposals, and outline
an ideal tax plan that promotes entrepreneurship and economic
growth. Leading ideas for replacing the current income tax system
include a flat income tax, a national retail sales tax, a "consumed-income"
tax, or a value- added tax (VAT). 

Naturally, every form of taxation has a downside - our goal should be to minimize such distortions our current income tax system fails this test miserably, and the search is on for an imporved tax system.

<center><h3>Testimony of Taalib-Din Abdul Uqdah<br>
Co-Owner<br>
Cornrows & Co.<p></h3>
<h4>An Opposition To An Increase In<br>
The Minimum Wage</h4> 
<hr>
<p>
</center>
<blockquote>
Madam Chairperson, members of the committee, my name
is Taalib-Din Abdul Uqdah.  I am the co-owner of Cornrows &amp;
Co., a hair-braiding salon located in Washington, D.C..  I thank
the Small Business Committee for the opportunity to appear before
you today.  Given the direct impact of the proposed unfunded mandate
on small business operations, I think it is vitally important
that the United States Congress hear from small business owners.
 I appreciate the Committee giving small businesses, like mine,
a voice in this process.  <BR>
<P>
I started my business, Cornrows &amp; Co., in June
1980 with $500, a 4-year lease on a building owned by someone
else, and three employees.  Today, I employ 12 full-time people,
including my wife and myself, two part-time people and I have
consistently grossed approximately $500,000 annually.  My most
crowning achievement is that I now own a 4,000 square foot building,-
and it is valued at over $400,000.<BR>
<P>
I have been self-employed for 22 years.  Over the
last 16 years, I have discovered that one of the biggest obstacles
to small business growth is government interference and micro-management.
 I have spent nearly 12 years fighting state government's for
the right to operate my business in the United States, free of
nonsensical bureaucratic regulations.  And now this: an unfunded
mandate.<BR>
<P>
For this and a host of other reasons to follow, I
oppose an increase in the starting wage.  The proposals by President
Clinton and members of Congress to increase the starting wage
creates another hurdle for small business growth.  It  represents
another death nail in the coffin of the United States' free enterprise
system and makes a mockery of the notion that we can produce,
manufacture, and exchange goods and services free of government
regulation and interference.  Because of federal legislation,
the free market system no longer exists.  As a champion of that
system, I oppose a <U>mandated</U> starting wage.  And I most
definitely oppose an <U>increase</U> in the starting wage.<BR>
<P>
The government should protect free enterprise, not
hinder it.  Has this Congress or the Clinton Administration given
any thought to the consequences of their &quot;feel good&quot;
legislation on the small businesses that create America's job
opportunities?  <BR>
<P>
By forcing me to pay a mandated minimum wage, <U>with
no consideration given to my business operations, market conditions
or feasibility studies</U>, not only does the federal government
imply its distrust of me as a businessperson, but also, the government
risk the employment of low-skilled people - the purported beneficiaries
of the proposed wage hike.<BR>
<P>
For the people of the District of Columbia, the impact
of a mandated wage hike will have implications well beyond the
political grandstanding of those interested in creating &quot;feel-good,
election year&quot; legislation.<BR>
<P>
  First, minimum-wage workers know that the more
they earn, the more federal, state, county and/or local government's
will claim for taxes.  The impact of the wage hike on the take-home
pay of minimum wage earners will be negligible.  <BR>
<P>
Second, while the impact of the wage hike on the
take-home pay would be negligible for minimum wage earners, the
impact of the mandate on employers would be substantial.  As payroll
dollars increase, so does employers' cost for worker's compensation,
Social Security, Medicare, and both federal and local unemployment
compensation. <BR>
<P>
Third, under existing law, businesses operating in
the District of Columbia must pay minimum wage employees $1 above
the federal rate.  Currently in D.C., unskilled employees' wages
start at $5.25 an hour.  If Congress mandates President Clinton's
proposal to raise the starting wage by $0.90, I would be forced
to pay an untrained, unskilled worker $6.15 per hour.  <BR>
<P>
How can I afford to bring in an unskilled worker,
when for the duration of the training period, he or she generates
no revenue?  What if this employee leaves during the training
period?  What about my losses?  Where is my incentive to hire
an unskilled employee who requires extensive and intensive training,
generates no revenue, and costs me a minimum of $50 per day? 
<BR>
<P>
The District of Columbia's current starting wage
-- at a rate higher than the federal mandate -- already forces
me and other employers to close the door on applicants unqualified
to do the job at $5.25 an hour.  Are these applicants more qualified
at $6.15 an hour?<BR>
<P>
An increase in the starting wage will not benefit
low-skilled workers. To counter the starting wage increase, small
businesses, like mine, will not hire low-skilled workers.  Some
employers may even reduce current employee hours or raise prices.
 All of these effects risk the livelihood of the low-skilled worker,
again, the &quot;ghostly&quot; beneficiary of a wage increase.
<BR>
<P>
I cannot afford to hire unskilled applicants at the
minimum wage.  The cost of their employment would be too great
a burden for my business.  It is more cost effective for me to
hire a skilled worker.   Pay the skilled worker one and one-half
times more than the unskilled worker, and watch as the skilled
employee generates at least three times the revenue that an unskilled
employee could.  <BR>
<P>
A federally mandated starting wage does not work.
 Bureaucrats should stop imposing artificial wage rates on businesses.
 The unemployment effect that results from an increase will be
concentrated on the most disadvantaged of the work force -- unskilled,
at-risk youths.  <BR>
<P>
Further, the mandated starting wage implies that
the marketplace does not work.  This simply is not true.<BR>
<P>
In every industry, there is a need to keep quality
employees. And quality employees are paid based on their productivity
and worth, not on an arbitrary number selected by politicians.
 <BR>
<P>
<U>I started all of my employees at the minimum wage.</U>
 After a training period in which they increased their skills,
I increased their salary.  Now all of my employees <U>earn</U>
well above the minimum wage.<BR>
<P>
Know this: <U>I</U> increase my employees' salary,
not because the government commands me to, but because my employees
<U>earn</U> their salary increases.  I and other employers do
not need the government to micro-manage our businesses.<BR>

<P>
Small businesses, like mine, generate jobs.  Yet,
ever-increasing tax rates and regulatory burdens already destroys
incentives for small business creation in  cities.  Increasing
the minimum wage undoubtedly increases the tax and regulatory
costs of business operations.  As any economist knows, increasing
the regulatory and tax burden of small businesses will make economic
growth for the District or any municipality nonexistent. <BR>
<P>
Where is the &quot;feel good&quot; measure for business?
Where are the incentives and initiatives that induce me to hire
more workers, open more establishments, invest in the District's
economy?  What is being done to make the wage hike more palatable
for the small business owner already besieged by taxes and regulations?
<BR>
<P>
The wage hike proposal did not start the United States
down the road to economic ruin; no, that started when Congress
decided it had to regulate businesses in this country. <BR>
<P>
I was led to believe by the Clinton Administration
and members of Congress that the era of big government was over.
 I do not see an end to big government. </FONT>
<P>
We need a system that supports a free market economy
and increases business growth, opportunity and employment for
all Americans.  I urge the U.S. Congress to oppose an increase
in the minimum wage.  <BR>
<P>
Again, I thank the Committee and I look forward to
answering any questions you may have.</FONT>

<h3>"Superfund and Small Business"</h3> 
<b>Testimony by<br>
 Raymond J. Keating<br> 
Chief Economist<br>
Small Business Survival Committee<P>

before the <br>
Committee on Small Business
<P>U.S. House of 
Representatives</b></center>	
<hr>
<P>


Mrs. Chairwoman and Members of the Committee, I thank you for inviting me here today to discuss Superfund's impact on small businesses and ideas for reform.  My name is Ray Keating, and I am chief economist for the Small Business Survival Committee, a small business advocacy organization with over 40,000 members across the nation.<P>	Since its creation in 1980, Superfund has unleashed the bloated bureaucracy and gross inefficiencies of the federal government on unsuspecting businesses across the nation; turned essentially local or, at most, state problems into national woes;  set arbitrary and unattainable criteria for compliance; sent legal costs skyrocketing; forced many businesses to close their doors; reduced capital available for investment in certain industries; restrained job growth; and damaged U.S. international competitiveness.  Quite a record for one piece of legislation, but there is still more.<P>	

Small businesses -- whether seeking out additional capital for growth or just fighting to stay alive -- are particularly vulnerable to the woes of Superfund.  Legal costs, expenditures for cleaning up sites to which they contributed little, groping through the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) bureaucracy, and a thick governmental fog obscuring future costs and risks, can stop a small business in its tracks and even kill it.<P>	

At the core of Superfund's problems is its mechanism for assigning liability to perfectly innocent parties.  If a business disposed of waste -- toxic or non-toxic, large or insignificant amounts -- in good conscience and in complete accordance with the law, it can still be held liable for the costs of cleaning up the disposal site if it later became a Superfund site.  Notions of responsibility and fairness mean absolutely nothing under Superfund.<P>	

Indeed, in assigning liability under Superfund, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) utilizes highly questionable criteria:<P>
<ul>
<LI> Superfund allows for strict liability, i.e., regardless of intent or negligence.<P>

<LI> Superfund liability is retroactive, meaning that actions taken before the law was enacted still apply.  So even if firms were in full compliance of the law, Superfund still exposes them to liability.<P>

<LI> Joint and several liability also applies under Superfund.  Therefore, the EPA can require that one business pay for the entire clean up irrespective of the degree of its own contribution to the waste site and without consideration to the total number of contributors.  No concept of "fair share" exists under Superfund.  Seeking relief, this unfortunate EPA selectee files contribution suits against other businesses connected to the waste site.  All parties tend to turn to their insurance companies for reimbursement.  Legal costs balloon.<P>

<LI> Current or past owners of a Superfund site who contributed absolutely nothing to the waste problem can be held liable.<P>

<LI> The burden of proof lies with the accused to prove their innocence rather than the EPA proving guilt under Superfund.<P>	

The EPA's main criteria for assigning liability for a Superfund site often seems to merely be "deep pockets" -- whoever is able to pay will pay for a site clean up.  Of course, this is not an ironclad rule.  After all, sometimes deep pockets cannot be found, in which case anyone will do -- including small businesses with but the most distant relationship to the site.  And even if the EPA finds "deep pockets," these same "deep pockets" seek to recover their own costs by bringing contribution suits against these same small enterprises. </ul>
<P>As one might expect, this system has developed into a costly, legal quagmire.  Individual Superfund horror stories abound -- seemingly too numerous to count.  These are well documented, and I certainly can supply the Committee with many, but for now I would like to touch upon some of the overall, weighty costs of Superfund.  For example:<P>
<ul>
<LI> Of the 1,292 "worst" waste sites on the Superfund National Priority List (NPL), only 237 have been cleaned up -- about 18 percent -- according to Heritage Foundation analyst John Shanahan.  One should note that this is a more optimistic accounting of cleaned up sites.  On February 14, 1994, for example, Business Week reported that out of 1,270 sites on the Superfund list just 49 "have been completely cleaned up."<P>

<LI> Yet, the federal government has spent almost $10 billion on Superfund and forced private parties to kick in another $80 billion.  The average NPL site takes 10 years to clean up at an average cost of $30 million.  <P>

<LI> On average, transaction costs account for 32 
percent of total private-sector Superfund costs, with litigation making up 65 percent of this amount or 21 percent of total costs.<P>

<LI> Once caught in the Superfund liability morass, it becomes much more difficult for a firm to attract capital, make investments, and therefore, grow and create jobs.  Superfund's strict, retroactive, and joint and several liabilities create considerable uncertainties for firms.  Such unknown costs chase away investors and make expansion plans quite dubious.<P>

Small businesses suffer most under these added costs and 
risks.  Without the Superfund cloud hanging over it, investing in, starting up, and expanding a small venture is already a risky undertaking.  Superfund liabilities only raise the hurdles faced by small business even further.<P>

<LI> Superfund also creates disincentives for investment in long industrialized urban areas.  The threat of enormous liability discourages firms from buying land in and renewing formerly industrialized areas.  Instead, it's safer to build new facilities elsewhere.  So many U.S. cities already impose large burdens on the private sector -- including high taxes, heavy regulations, bloated government budgets, and more -- and Superfund adds to these costs.  Under such circumstances, it is no wonder that the entrepreneur is becoming an endangered species in many U.S. cities.<P>

<LI> Finally, according to a Center for the Study of American Business  Superfund study, "Superfund imposes much more stringent regulations on manufacturing and other firms doing business in the United States than these companies would be required to meet in other countries."  Interestingly, in nations like Canada, Mexico, Germany, Japan, Great Britain, and others, liability rarely reaches entities that legally disposed of their waste; instead, liability is linked to fault.<P>
</ul>
What should be done?  Understanding the 
constraints of the political process, the Small Business Survival Committee supports a three-step reform plan.<P>

As a first step, we support many measures currently under consideration in Congress, including repealing retroactive liability for all actions taken before 1987, as suggested by U.S. Representative Bill Zeliff (R-NH) in his proposed Superfund reform bill -- thereby eliminating costly litigation at about 80 percent of Superfund sites; from 1987 forward, basing liability on the proportion of waste a party contributed to the site; using science-based risk assessment to determine clean up remedies; capping the Superfund NPL of sites so that the Superfund program can be phased out; and no imposition of any new taxes.<P>	

As a second step, the Small Business Survival Committee supports the complete repeal of the strict, retroactive, and joint and several liability schemes.  To achieve real fairness, even proportional liability must give way.   Superfund should only assign liability to individuals and businesses who broke the law, who were negligent, fraudulent, deceptive , etc.  This is the only true "polluter pays" scenario.  Small businesses, or any sized business, that simply sent waste to a site in an honest manner, in full compliance with the law, should have absolutely no liability whatsoever.  In essence, they are not polluters.  <P>	Step three, or the final goal of Superfund reform, should be to terminate Superfund.  In fact, a waste site clean up is not a federal issue, unless, of course,  operated by the federal government or undertaken due to a new federal law or mandate.  In these two instances, federal responsibility is clear.  Otherwise, waste site clean ups should be left as local, or at most,  state issues.  Localities are in a better position to judge the costs and benefits of clean ups.  If completely unable to carry the costs of a necessary clean up, then state government should be turned to for assistance.    <P>	

State and local clean-up efforts have proved to be far more efficient, timely, and less costly.  Local individuals possess a far better understanding of their community's circumstances and needs than do EPA bureaucrats.<P>	

Once again, I thank you for inviting me here today to address the Superfund issue, and I would be glad to answer any questions you may have.

<title>   Testimony of Karen Kerrigan on Spectrum Allocation

<center><h3>Testimony of Karen Kerrigan<BR>
President<BR>
Small Business Survival Committee</h3>

<h4>Before
Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation<BR>
United States Senate<BR>
September 12, 1995
<P>
On Spectrum Allocation</h4></center>
<hr>



Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee,
<P>
I am here today representing the Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC) -- a 40,000 
member nonpartisan, nonprofit advocacy organization which fights against the growing burden 
of taxes and regulations on America's small businesses and entrepreneurs -- SBSC supports free 
markets over government industrial policy.  SBSC also spearheads the Campaign for Broadcast 
Competition, a coalition of advocacy organizations opposing the proposed giveaway of the 
spectrum to the nation's broadcasters.   
<P>
I am especially pleased to be here today.  It is not often that one has the opportunity to 
publicly oppose what many have said will be the most expensive case of corporate welfare in the 
history of our Nation.
<P>
I am speaking, of course, about the proposed giveaway of the nation's airwaves to the 
broadcasting industry.  This is the expensive residue of a failed industrial policy, and it can, and 
should be reversed.
<P>
The story starts innocently enough with an "America first" technology program.  It turned 
into an unprecedented government giveaway of taxpayer-owned airwaves.  And, absent 
Congressional action, it will conclude by rewarding an industry which has time and again turned 
its back on its public service obligations.
<P>
As you know, Mr. Chairman, the Federal Communications Commission seven years ago 
pursued a plan to make High Definition Television (HDTV) the broadcasting standard for the 
United States.  As part of that plan, the FCC proposed giving the broadcasters new spectrum to 
allow them to move from analog television to HDTV.  Once HDTV was in place, the theory was, 
the analog spectrum would be returned to the government.<P>
<P>
As is often the case with bureaucrats playing venture capitalists, the market outsmarted 
and surpassed the government's chosen industrial "winner."  In this case, digital technology far 
outstripped the ability of bureaucrats to see into the future, rendering all of this planning for 
HDTV, for all intensive purposes, obsolete.
<P>
With the new digital technology each new digital TV channel can be used for one HDTV 
signal.  Or, it can be split into 6 very high quality digital TV signals.  (In other words  the 
spectrum gift combined with new digital technology now transforms CBS into 6 CBS's; ABC 
into 6 ABC's and so on).
<P>
This free new spectrum need not be used just for television; it will unlock an unlimited 
number of new lucrative businesses for the broadcasters.  The spectrum could be used to provide 
72 digital radio channels, computer data delivery, wireless telephone service, pay TV -- or any 
combination of each of them -- as well as other profitable uses.
<P>
In the face of the new technology, the broadcasters profess a continued commitment to
HDTV and the use of the new Advanced Television (ATV) channels for HDTV. 
<P>                                                                                                    
...Or maybe not.  This year the broadcasters have insisted on receiving the "flexibility" to 
use the spectrum as they see fit.   Broadcasters are actively exploring the opportunities for 
potential new services -- as they should be.  The questions today are:  why are the broadcasters 
the chosen few for the privilege of "spectrum flexibility," and why should they get it for free!
<P>
Now, as the broadcasters freely admit, HDTV is a technological and economic dinosaur.  
They don't want to be shackled to it, nor should they.  There is no market for it, and other digital 
technologies would use the airwaves far more efficiently.
<P>
The broadcasters correctly realize that new digital technology will transform communications as we know it.  And what they want is the valuable distribution pipeline -- the 
spectrum -- with no strings attached.  They clearly do not want it for the purpose for which it was 
intended -- providing HDTV.  They may want it to provide digital television.  But, no one really 
knows, since the technology is changing almost daily.
<P>
But while the broadcasters don't want to be held to the HDTV implementation, they still 
want the additional spectrum -- free of charge.  Why?  Because it is valuable.  If this spectrum 
were auctioned as the PCS spectrum was last year, it could raise between $10 billion and $100 
billion.
<P>
Even in Washington, that's a lot of money.  These market value estimates are not just 
random numbers picked out of  a hat.  Even the FCC conservatively estimates that the spectrum 
is worth between $11 billion and $70 billion.1  <P>In response to questions from the Senate, the FCC has attempted to calculate the potential value of the spectrum.  Within the past few weeks, ITT and Dow Jones paid a whopping $207 million to buy WNYC, New York City's local public UHF station.  The station has few hard assets, no programming appeal -- its new owners are going to switch to commercial programming, with a limited viewership . . . In short, the 26 companies who bid for WNYC wanted to pay big bucks for one thing, its spectrum.
<P>
Based solely on the $207 million paid for WNYC, the FCC valued the spectrum 
potentially at $37 billion.
<P>
"Even" at $37 billion, the figure is more than double the amount this committee needs to 
raise to reach its target in the massive effort to balance the federal budget.  And, the FCC says 
this a conservative estimate.  Some experts estimate that the market value of the digitized spectrum in the not too distant future will reach nearly a half-trillion dollars.
<P>
And the FCC doesn't disagree.2   In a May 5th letter, the FCC said that private market valuation of the spectrum in the future might approach $500 billion.<P>Why this special gift of largesse to the broadcasters?  The proposed giveaway not only flys in the face of efforts to balance the budget but also bucks a profound message that voters sent to Washington last November -- no more coddling of special interests at the expense of other Americans.<P>The giveaway to the broadcasters can't be a reward for the great job they've done serving 
the public good --  as they claim, and as required by their current licenses.  As everyone who has 
a TV knows, and as numerous Congressional hearings this year have shown, the broadcasters 
have done a good job at packing the airwaves with programming that the majority of American 
households find troubling and offensive.
<P>
One media reviewer said that the broadcasters' motto for the upcoming fall lineup must 
be:  "To hell with kids.  Many of the wholesome sitcoms that once ruled the 8:00-9:00 pm hour 
have gone to the graveyard, replaced by racier fair. . ."3<P>The news coverage is no better.  The president of NBC's News Division, Andrew Lack, admitted that "too often we now choose, without a moment's hesitation, to report the story that makes you fell repulsion over the story that makes you think -- which in television means usually boring."  Mr. Lack went on to ask his peers:  "And why do we keep pushing it?  Are we all just whores in search of another share point or a better November book?"4 <P>While the broadcasters hide behind their "unique public service" responsibilities as an argument to shield them from a prospective auction of the valuable spectrum; the public, media critiques and now industry insiders question their competency in this regard.<P>Of course, competition in the form of cable, direct broadcast satellite, on-line computer services and more has given consumers added viewing choices.  Broadcasters have not gone the wayside because of this competition.  Their bottom-lines and profits continue to increase.
<P>
The broadcasters plead that to pay for spectrum will kill "free" TV.  But the recent 
purchase prices and bids for the networks prove that investment money is available for those who 
want to have the privilege of providing "free" TV.  Walt Disney, which paid $19.3 billion for 
ABC/Cap Cities obviously sees investment pay-offs.  Westinghouse which offered $5.4 billion 
for CBS appears to view the business as profitable as well.
<P>
In the past year alone, the networks combined revenues were $21.42 billion.  Their 
combined profits were $2.82 billion.   Clearly, broadcasting is more profitable than ever.
<P>
Robert Wright, [president] of NBC, recently told the National Press Club that "right now 
broadcast television -- and NBC -- are both having banner years.  And even more important, the 
fundamentals of the industry are looking strong as well."  Congratulations Mr. Wright.  Keep up 
the good work.  Apparently advertising-supported TV is doing fine, and will continue to profit 
handsomely -- without a big government handout.
<P>
The FCC agrees with Mr. Wright:  over-the-air broadcasting is and will continue to 
thrive.5     In a September letter, the FCC pointed to the ABC, CBS and WNYC deals, and concluded that:  "free over-the-air television is such a lucrative business, there is no reason to believe that either analog or digital broadcasters will cease providing this service."<P>Finally, advertising-supported broadcasting will only go away if its viewership goes 
away.  If the audience is there, advertisers will continue to subsidize what the broadcasters 
modestly call "free" TV by paying for the right to reach viewers.
<P>
The broadcasters also claim that "they" shouldn't be singled our for auctions, and that the 
Commerce Committee should auction the government spectrum first.
<P>
However, as Faye Anderson one of my close colleagues has recently stated, comparing 
the broadcast spectrum to government spectrum is like comparing "pork loin to pig's feet."
<P>
According to Dale Hatfield, a noted spectrum expert and Reagan Administration 
technology official, this is the cleanest spectrum available.  It is beachfront property.  Mr. 
Chairman, to paraphrase Willie Sutton, if you are going to raise money through auctions, you 
must go where the value is.
<P>
More importantly, the broadcasters are not the only users who have been asked to pay for 
the public airwaves.  As the Committee well knows, Congress in 1993 mandated that the FCC  
auction all licenses for new spectrum.  For example, the FCC already has sold only a part of the 
PCS spectrum for $8 billion.  That's $8 billion that went to the US Treasury.
<P>
If they want to play, let's have them pay.  If it is good enough for PCS, it is good enough 
for all the new businesses the broadcasters hope to pursue.
<P>
Now, the broadcasters have two other arguments.  First, they argue that such a large 
auction of spectrum will depress values and thus won't raise much money.  Then, they argue that 
broadcasters couldn't possibly afford the spectrum, and thus couldn't provide digital television.  
Our question is, which one is it?
<P>
Either way, the public wins.  We tend to believe that there will be buyers for this 
spectrum.  The FCC agrees.  With all the possible benefits of digital broadcasting, the FCC 
expects that numerous companies, <u>including the broadcasters</U>, will compete for and likely win many digital licenses.6   In other words, somewhere between here and the auction block, the broadcasters will figure out ways to participate in the bidding process.
<P>
This, of course, begs the question:  is the government and the U.S. taxpayer responsible 
for guaranteeing NBC's long-term success, or any other broadcaster's?  I don't think so.
<P>
One last question:  under the current broadcaster proposal, the broadcasters will retain 
their analog signal for anywhere between 10 and 15 years, when digital TV becomes the 
standard.  What happens after 15 years and digital TV has only penetrated 80 percent of the 
market or 90 percent or even 95 percent?  Is Congress going to turn off the analog signal just like 
that?  Even if millions upon millions of their constituents are still watching analog televisions?  
In short, the broadcasters will continue to own their analog licenses for the foreseeable future and 
beyond, even while they get to exploit the myriad new digital technologies.  This is unfair no 
matter how you slice it.
<P>
Mr. Chairman and members of the Commerce Committee, I realize that the broadcasters 
have been an extremely powerful lobby in Washington.  Given the upsurge in interest we have 
seen on this issue, I think that their political dominance, as with this deal, is largely a thing of the 
past.
<P>
What you have today is an opportunity  -- perhaps the last opportunity in the foreseeable 
future -- to encourage the development of an innovative, competitive, profitable broadcasting 
future, instead of tying the future to the history of the past fifty years.
<P>
You have the opportunity to raise tens of billions of dollars and in so doing demonstrate a 
careful stewardship of one of our nation's most valuable assets.
<P>
And you have the chance to encourage competition while destroying the most egregious 
of set-asides.
<P>
In his June speech, Mr. Wright spoke of the need to encourage change and competition in the communications marketplace.
<P>
Technological change is already upon us:  new digital technologies will soon allow the 
new spectrum to be used to transmit multiple digital TV signals; additional subscription services 
-- like HBO; newspapers; local news and data; computer/video games. . .the options are nearly 
endless.
<P>
The problem is that the broadcasters now ask that Congress give them a free ride in this 
technological carnival.  Mr. Wright recently estimated that this market generates $100 billion in 
annual revenues.7  And NBC and CBS and ABC and FOX and all the other broadcasters want in. . . the easy, cheap way.<P>Of course, they're already all already part way there.  NBC alone: owns two 24-hour cable 
networks, has interests in 19 other cable networks, has multiple international broadcasting 
properties; and has entered the new computer-media market with NBC Desktop Video, NBC 
Digital Publishing and NBC Data Network.

<P>
Clearly, the broadcasters are financially capable and market savvy enough to identify and exploit new markets.  They don't need the government's help.  They already control a majority of 
the TV market.  We don't need to give them a head start in the race to win the digital 
marketplace.
<P>
I look forward to discussing this issue with you and answering any questions you have.
<P>
Thank you.           <P>

<h3>Dismantling the U.S. Department of Commerce</h3> 
<b>Testimony by<br>
 Raymond J. Keating<br> 
Chief Economist<br>
Small Business Survival Committee<P>

before the <br>
Subcommittee on Government Management, Information and Technology
<br>Government Reform and Oversight Committee
<P>U.S. House of 
Representatives</b></center>	
<hr>
<P>Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee, I thank you for inviting me here today to discuss the "Department of Commerce Dismantling Act."  My name is Ray Keating, and I am chief economist for the Small Business Survival Committee, a small business advocacy organization with over 40,000 members across the nation.

<P>	Let me start off by putting your minds at ease.  In no way does the survival of America's small businesses depend upon the continuing existence of the U.S. Department of Commerce, despite what some Commerce Department supporters may tell you.  For example, in a Small Business Survival Committee survey earlier this year, we found that 65 percent of small business owners saw the government as an opponent, while only 34 percent perceived government as a partner.  While the Commerce Department may help a few, select businesses, the other businesses and taxpayers who foot the bill see it as just another federal government department costing them money.  In contrast, the dismantling of the Commerce Department could have a very significant, positive impact on the entrepreneurial sector of our economy.	<P>
Rather than perpetuating failed industrial policy in the form of the Commerce Department, the most productive steps Congress can take to help the entrepreneur would be to downsize government, cut taxes, deregulate industry, and lower trade barriers -- essentially, get government out of the way.  The Small Business Survival Committee believes that the seemingly relentless trek toward a $2-trillion federal government must be stopped and reversed.  Eliminating the Commerce Department is an important early step in this process for three main reasons:
<ul>
<li> First, as described in the attached Small Business Survival Committee report, which I ask be placed into the record, the Commerce Department is a $3.6 billion department filled with programs and endeavors that either would be better left to the private sector (such as economic development and technology investment), or should be moved to other federal departments (like the Patent and Trademark Office to the Justice Department).
<P>
<li> Second, the Commerce Department stands as an example of the grand delusion of government's powers and abilities.  Supporters of the Commerce Department, most prominently Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, claim that the department serves taxpayers and the economy well by increasing U.S. exports, seeding new technologies, and boosting economic growth.  Secretary Brown even asserted at the White House Conference on Small Business on June 13, 1995 that the Commerce Department leveraged a "$250 million export promotion budget into $25 billion in overseas sales."  He also stated that an end to the Department's Manufacturing Extension Program would leave "America's 380,000 small manufacturers, with nearly twelve million employees, without accessible and supportive local extension programs providing up-to-date strategies and technologies."  
<P>
Such declarations are, to say the least, most difficult to believe.  Indeed, if America's small manufacturers relied on a government program for "up-to-date strategies and technologies" and exporters depended on Commerce bureaucrats to sell their wares, our economy today would be a third-world basketcase.  Again, Secretary Brown and other Commerce Department proponents fall prey to the grand delusion of industrial policy.  
<P>
In reality, government does not possess the proper knowledge and incentives to be picking industry winners and losers; nor should taxpayer dollars be placed at risk in such futile endeavors.  As for expanding U.S. exports, the federal government's role should be limited to lowering trade barriers.  And in terms of boosting economic growth, the economy would be far better served, as I've already said,  if taxes were cut -- boosting incentives to work, invest, and take risks -- and the Commerce Department terminated.  In the end, individuals buying, selling, creating, and investing in the marketplace always work better than government bureaucrats pushing paper and spending taxpayer dollars.
<P>
<li> Third, if you are going to cut spending across the federal budget, as the Small Business Survival Committee urges Congress to do, then it makes sense to start with the easy cuts.  
<P>The Commerce Department is an easy cut.  If you can't make the easy cuts, then what happens when you get to the more politically difficult, though still very much economically sound, spending reductions?  
</ul><P>
The Commerce Department does not serve the taxpayers well and should be eliminated.  It is the Small Business Survival Committee's position that this be done in a timely fashion.  We support the idea of the Commerce Programs Resolution Agency (CPRA) being given a set time period in which to dismantle the department and then terminate its own operations.  

<P>
While not offering specifics in terms of budgets and resources for CPRA, we assume it will be a lean entity operating on a portion of the savings from the immediate cuts in Commerce Department programs.  The Small Business Survival Committee does offer a few principles that should govern the Commerce Department termination process:
<ul>
<li> The goals and mission of the CPRA should be clear cut from the beginning.  The final resting place for each program and agency within the Commerce Department should be already determined (i.e., either termination, privatization, or transfer to another agency) prior to the CPRA team being established.
<P>
<li> Congress should be strict with its time limitation on the CPRA, and leave no door ajar for extensions.  Indeed, we urge you to more closely examine whether three years are actually necessary to carry out this process.  It seems rather lengthy.   After all it does not take a business that was sunk by high taxes and onerous regulations that long to close its doors.
<P>
<li> To ensure that the CPRA remains a temporary entity that does not turn into a permanent bureaucracy, the Small Business Survival Committee suggests that its duties be contracted out to a private firm specializing in organizational overhauls and business downsizings.  The firm's performance would be reviewed regularly while under contract.  Indeed, Congress should offer incentives to speed up the process of closing the doors of the Commerce Department in order to save taxpayer dollars.
<P>
<li> The CPRA should be viewed neither as an extension of the Commerce Department or as a new agency.  Instead, it should be viewed as a temporary transition team to shut down the Commerce Department.  In fact, Congress probably should not call it an "agency" at all -- avoiding any sense of permanency.
</ul>
<P>
In closing, I would just urge you to be bold.  The vast majority of America's entrepreneurs and taxpayers see a clear need for reducing government's role in the economy.  Eliminating the Commerce Department should be the beginning of downsizing the federal government.	Thank you again for inviting me here today, and I would be glad to answer any of your questions.

<h3>Reforming OSHA</h3> 
<b>Testimony by<br>
 Raymond J. Keating<br> 
Chief Economist<br>
Small Business Survival Committee<P>

before the <br>
Subcommittee on Workforce Protections<br>Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities<P>U.S. House of 
Representatives</b></center>
<hr>
<P>	


Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee, I thank you for inviting me here today to discuss the Safety and Health Improvement and Regulatory Reform Act of 1995, and OSHA  reform in general.  My name is Ray Keating, and I am chief economist for the Small Business Survival Committee, a small business advocacy organization with over 40,000 members across the nation.<P>	

How could anyone find fault with a government agency named the "Occupational Safety and Health Administration"?  However, in fact, there is much to find fault with at OSHA.  OSHA has become a burdensome regulatory body which seems to be more concerned with paper pushing and imposing fines rather than with assisting businesses in establishing safer working environments. This is the view justifiably held by many business owners and operators, including most of the Small Business Survival Committee's 40,000 members.  Indeed, a recent nationwide survey of 500 small businesses sponsored by SBSC revealed that OSHA ranked with the IRS and the EPA as the most burdensome federal agencies.<P>	

Contrary to the view of OSHA's most enthusiastic proponents, the private sector possesses every incentive to maintain a safe and healthy working environment for employees.  Indeed, beyond a commonly held concern for one's employees, the financial incentives for safety are substantial.  I.e., safety pays.  "Safety" costs for U.S. business in 1992 were estimated in excess of $200 billion, far outweighing the $72 million in OSHA citations.<P>	

Workplaces that are not safe have always been and remain the exception rather than the rule.  OSHA acts under the opposite assumption, thereby imposing significant and unnecessary costs on business and the economy.  Such costs translate into less entrepreneurship, slower economic growth, and fewer jobs.  It is time that OSHA's regulations and activities reflect the fact that most businesses do indeed maintain "safe and healthful working conditions."<P>	The evidence that OSHA has gone far astray from an educational, advisory and cooperative relationship with business is substantial.  Indeed, OSHA's concern for real safety seems lost in a bureaucratic and regulatory haze of paperwork, citation quotas, and remarkably inane regulations.  I have outlined some of these developments, along with other related facts about OSHA regulations and expenditures, in the accompanying paper entitled "Warning: OSHA Can Be Hazardous to the Nation's Economic Health."  I ask that this short analysis be submitted into the record.<P>	

There are three points from this analysis I would like to mention here.  First, OSHA manages to combine two of the worst aspects of government regulatory bodies.  It creates an incredible paperwork burden on U.S. business.  In 1994, seven of the top ten most frequent OSHA citations were related to paperwork.  OSHA has perfected the government "make work" scheme -- generate a blizzard of paperwork regulations and then fine businesses for not complying.<P>	

Second, a prevailing problem with government regulation and inspections of any industry or workplace is that most, if not all, regulators are not experts in particular industries.  If they were experts, one would expect that they would hold productive, private sector jobs.  They are government bureaucrats.  Bureaucrats know paperwork.  Hence, the most cited violations by OSHA are paperwork related.  <P>	

Third, the gross budget authority for OSHA was over $298 million in 1994.  Tax dollars spent on federal enforcement and state programs (administering and enforcing state standards) account for 70 percent of OSHA's budget.  As with many of OSHA's other activities, I think this reflects an attitude of confrontation towards rather than cooperation with business.<P>	Even after one notes the many OSHA horror stories, regulations, paperwork burdens, and costs, some still claim that OSHA's benefits outweigh its many costs.  For example, in a May 16, 1995 speech, President Clinton linked OSHA with reduced workplace deaths.  He stated: "The Occupational Safety and Health Administration has been at work in this cause since it was created with bipartisan support in 1970.  Since that time, workplace deaths have been cut in half."<P>

Of course, workplace deaths were on the decline long before OSHA was created.  Fewer workplace deaths reflect many changes in our economy -- greater automation, shift in employment from manufacturing to services, leaps in technology, enhanced knowledge, et al.  There exists no clear and substantial evidence that OSHA has played any significant role in preventing workplace injuries or death.<P>	

In light of these facts, SBSC supports Representative Cass Ballenger's "Safety and Health Improvement and Regulatory Reform Act of 1995."  It offers many real, positive OSHA reforms.  In particular, I'd like to note the following:<P>
<ul>
<LI> A Voluntary Compliance Program (VCP) allowing any employer to utilize an approved private-sector safety and health consultant for safety and health reviews.  Participants in the VCP would be exempt from random OSHA inspections for up to one year.  	Such a reform will help to alleviate the problem of lack of expertise among OSHA inspectors.  By essentially contracting out these inspections to the private sector, private firms, including perhaps insurance companies, will have clear incentives to become industry experts, more so than government bureaucrats today.<P>

<LI> An opportunity for an employer to correct alleged safety and health violations before a citation is issued, unless a fatality or serious injury occurred.  With so many OSHA rules and regulations, allowing employers to correct alleged violations before being fined is a fair, much-needed reform.  This reform also should reduce OSHA's own paperwork burden.<P>

<LI> Eliminates penalties for posting and paperwork violations, except where a direct threat of injury or an intent to deceive OSHA exist.  This will considerably rollback OSHA's ability to impose frivolous penalties on employers, saving millions of dollars annually.<P>

<LI> Formally codifies the small business OSHA exemption 
from routine safety inspections, and expands it to firms with  50 or fewer employees that have below average injury rates.<P><LI> Requires the application of cost benefit, risk assessment, and regulatory impact analyses to OSHA regulations.  <P>

<LI> Reserves at least 50 percent of the OSHA budget for consultation, training, education, and compliance assistance programs.  This would be a good first step toward making OSHA a more cooperative federal agency.<P>

<LI> Seeks to apply stricter, non-arbitrary criteria in 
order for OSHA to levy fines in excess of $7,000.<P>

<LI> Requires that employees first go to employers to 
redress workplace problems before approaching OSHA.  Such a measure should greatly reduce frivolous and harassing complaints by employees who are disgruntled or in the midst of a labor dispute.<P>

<LI> Consolidates the Mine Safety and Health Administration with OSHA, and eliminates the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.  SBSC is a strong supporter of all efforts to eliminate waste and duplication in government, and to reduce government expenditures.<P>	These OSHA reforms and others included in Representative Ballenger's bill amount to much more than rhetoric about "reinventing" government.  They are real reforms that make for a somewhat saner regulatory regime, and will positively impact U.S. businesses and the economy.
<P>	</ul>
A new regulatory framework is needed in the United States.  One that no longer incorrectly assumes that business owners are merely callous exploiters of labor, but recognizes them as the risk takers, job creators, innovators, and producers they actually are.  If the U.S. economy is to compete and succeed in the twenty-first century, government's heavy hand of over-regulation must be lifted.  Reforming OSHA is a good start which has SBSC's full support.<P>

I thank the Committee, once again, for inviting me here today.  I will be glad to answer any questions you might have, and I offer SBSC's assistance in your efforts to provide for a saner regulatory environment in the United States.<P>

Owner<br>
Tyler Business Service<p>
                                
Before the <br>
Committee on Ways and Means<br>
United States House of Representatives<br>
June 6, 1995<p>
</center>                                
<hr>
<p>

     Good morning Chairman Archer and members of the committee.  My name is Ray Tyler, 
owner of Tyler Business Services located in Washington, D.C.  I am also a member of the Small 
Business Survival Committee, a nationwide, nonprofit, nonpartisan small business advocacy 
organization that fights against the growing burden of taxes and regulations on our nation's
small businesses and entrepreneurs.  Tyler Business Services is a full-service printing shop which
has been operating in the nation's capital for 35 years.<p>

     First, let me thank you Chairman Archer for inviting me to speak before the Ways and 
Means Committee today.  Secondly, I congratulate you for holding these hearings to address
the important issue of overhauling our nation's tax system.  Your leadership in this area is critical to 
not only today's small businesses and entrepreneurs, but also to the well-being of future small 
business owners  who indeed will need this committee's help to increase their chance of
success and survival.<p>

     I say this Chairman Archer, because I have been a small business owner for over 35 years 
and have seen the increased tax and regulatory burden placed on my own business.  The only 
way that I have been able to keep the doors of my business open has been through the paid 
assistance of professionals who specialize in the tax compliance area -- namely a 
Certified Public Accountant (CPA), a full-time bookkeeper, an attorney and bankers.<p>

     Last year my CPA cost the business over $9,000.  At least 10 percent of my 
staff bookkeeper's salary  -- about $4,500 -- is dedicated to dealing with lawyers, bankers and 
IRS issues.  The company pension fund, which I used to manage myself as well as pay 
someone $1,000 to do actuarial work ten years ago, cost me $26,000 last year because of
changes in the way the IRS administers the tax fund.  My billing department also incurs hefty tax code 
compliance costs.  And, of course, my time must be factored into these overall costs as well 
which take away from my productive time actually running the business.    Let me again add that 
these are just compliance costs -- not the actual taxes! <p>

     Today's small businessperson almost always has to pay professionals to navigate 
them through the complicated tax compliance maze.  And, this is a never-ending changing 
maze I might add.  According to the Tax Foundation, over the past forty years (since the
passage of the Internal Revenue Act of 1954 which put the income tax at the center of the federal tax 
system) thirty-one notable tax changes have taken place -- on average, a major change to the 
federal tax code every 1.3 years.  Not surprisingly, the increase of  the size and complexity of
the tax code has caused an increase in my tax compliance costs. <p>
  
     The uncertainty and instability of the tax system, the number of taxes that I must pay, 
combined with my total tax bill, and compliance costs is enough to drive anyone out of business. <p>

I'm not quite sure how a person starting his or her own business can quite make it these days.  
Fortunately my business has grown, and with it have been able to factor in the cost of taxes and 
tax compliance into my overall business costs.  I am almost sure that many business failures
are the direct result of our nation's excessive and burdensome tax system.  The current system
creates disincentives to save, invest and pursue risk-taking, entrepreneurial activity. <p>

     Many, many times in my business I try to do the right thing for my employees by creating 
incentives for them to stay with the business, and while they are with us be more productive 
employees.  When I first created a pension plan for the business (as mentioned above) I used
to manage it, but because of the complexity of the tax laws I had to turn it over to the bankers and 
the lawyers.  Now I just sign the reams of paperwork from the bank, and pay a lot to do simply 
that. <p>
                                
     At the end of each month if the business turns a profit, I also give bonuses to my 
employees.  The government even makes this difficult because I have to "renegotiate" salaries
to comply with misguided regulations.<p>

     The bottom-line to the costly and burdensome tax system is that my employees are hurt 
through lower wages, and my customers are hurt through higher prices.  And my business is
only one example of how the government is depressing our nation's standard of living and hurting 
economic growth and job creation.  <p>

     I, like many other small business owners, agree that something must be done to make our 
tax system less-costly, less-burdensome and more efficient.  That is why Chairman Archer you, 
and other leaders in the Congress who are advocating far-reaching proposals to overhaul the
tax system have certainly won the hearts of many small business owners.  And, although you may 
have won our hearts, lawmakers have not yet won our minds.  Because many small business 
owners believe that the federal government is incapable of making a tax system fair and less-
burdensome.  This is only an honest assessment of how many small business owners feel.  <p>

     However, I remain confident that perhaps this will occur in my lifetime.  By the way, I 
am 75 years-old and would appreciate it if you put these tax overhaul efforts on the
fast-track.<p>

     While at this point in time I do not advocate one tax system over another, I agree with 
some basic principles which have been well presented by the Small Business Survival 
Foundation.  Two leading proposals which "score" high against these principles are a flat tax
and a consumption tax -- or the national sales tax.  The basics of a sound tax system developed by
the Small Business Survival Foundation, and based on Adam Smith's maxims of a taxation in 1776, 
include:<p>
<ul>

<li>          Low Flat Tax Rate to Promote Economic Growth
<li>          No Taxation of Capital
<li>          Inflation Factor
<li>          Clarity
<li>          Simplicity
<li>          Limited Bureaucracy and Intrusiveness
<li>          Minimum Incentives for Tax Avoidance
<li>          No Additional Boost to Government Spending

</ul>
     I'd like to leave with you Chairman Archer, and I am sure that the Small Business 
Survival Foundation would make this available to all members of the committee, a copy of a 
Preliminary Report prepared by  the organization's chief economist called "The Great Tax 
Debate:  Making Sense of Competing Tax Plans."  This report details each of the above 
principles in greater detail, and how leading proposals score against the basics of a sound tax 
system. <p>

     Once again Chairman Archer I thank you for inviting me to be a part of these important 
hearings today.  While typical Washington observers will say that overhauling the nation's tax 
system is an impossible task that will never happen, I am just thrilled that we have entered a 
political environment where this debate is actually occurring.<p>

     Most hard-working taxpayers agree that something must be done to make the U.S. tax 
code more fair, less-costly and less-burdensome.  For our nation's small business owners, the 
current tax code is a mess and totally out-of-control.  I am so pleased that you are taking a lead
to help reward our nation's risk-takers and job creators which will lead to greater economic 
opportunity and security for all Americans.  I would be more than happy to answer any
questions you or committee members may have.   <p>

<title>"The Flat Tax and Small Business"</title>

<h3>The Flat Tax and Small Business</h3>
Testimony by Raymond J. Keating<br>
Chief Economist<br>
The Small Business Survival Committee<p>
Subcommittee on Taxation and Finance <br>
Committee on Small Business<br>
U.S. House of Representatives<br>
May 18, 1995<p>
</center>
<hr>
<p>

Madam Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee, I thank you for inviting me here today to discuss the flat income tax and its impact on the small business, entrepreneurial sector of our economy.  My name is Ray Keating, and I am chief economist for the Small Business Survival Committee, a small-business advocacy organization with over 40,000 members across the nation.<p>

As you well know, entrepreneurs drive the economy.  By creating and investing in new businesses, ideas, and innovations, the entrepreneur ensures capitalism's constant renewal and growth.  While government can assist this process by protecting life and limb and guaranteeing property rights, government unfortunately more often than not creates obstacles to entrepreneurship and economic growth.  Perhaps the most formidable of the many governmental obstacles thrown in the path of entrepreneurs during this century has been the U.S. federal income tax code.<p>

	As constituted today,  the federal income tax system amounts to a convoluted mess.  It is complicated, inefficient, intrusive, and serves as an impediment to entrepreneurship, investment, economic growth, and job creation.<p>

	To that end, it should come as no surprise that the great debate on overhauling our nation's tax system is welcomed with open arms by our nation's small business owners.  In fact, according to a recent survey by the Small Business Survival Committee and the Luntz Research Companies, the flat tax is resonating very favorably with the small business, entrepreneurial sector.  When given the specifics of Representative Dick Armey's flat tax plan, 56 percent of respondents from a nationwide survey of 500 small businesses supported the flat tax while 36 percent opposed it.  The intensity of the support is interesting as 25 percent "strongly support" the flat tax while 31 percent "somewhat support" it.  In terms of opposition to the flat tax, 15 percent of small business respondents "somewhat oppose," and 21 percent "strongly oppose" it.<p>  

	While the Small Business Survival Committee does not base its policy positions on surveys and polls, I provide you with these numbers to give the Committee a sense of the support for a flat tax in the business community.  We also found interesting trends in our survey based on business size and geographic location.  The larger the business, the greater was the intensity of support.  In terms of geographic location, businesses in the Mid-Atlantic, Southern, and Western states were more favorable to a flat tax, while respondents in New England, the Mid-West, rust-belt, and Pacific Coast states registered a greater intensity of opposition.  Please note, however, that across all categories of business size and location, support was strong for a flat tax.<p>

	Let me add again that we outlined the flat tax proposal for each participant -- specifically mentioning which tax write-offs they would lose, and what would not be taxed 
under the Armey plan.<p>

	In the accompanying Small Business Survival Foundation study (each of you should have a copy), I outlined some basic criteria for a sound tax system.  These are: <p>

<ul>
<li> <b>Low Flat Tax Rate to Promote Economic Growth</b> -- the lower and more proportional, or flatter, the tax rate system the better.  A flat tax is a fair system, as individuals and businesses pay taxes in proportion to the income they earn.  And more importantly, a low, flat tax rate creates far fewer disincentives for working, investing, and risk taking than does a system of steeply progressive tax rates.<p>

<li><b>No Taxation of Capital </b> -- taxing returns on investment and savings makes absolutely no economic sense. Taxes on savings, dividends and capital gains amount to double taxation and are essentially levies on economic growth.<p>

<li><b>Inflation Factor</b> -- the detrimental effects of inflation should be factored into any tax system's design.<p>

<li><b>Clarity</b> -- the clearer the tax system the better.  It should be apparent how much is owed, who is paying, and when the tax is being paid.<p>

<li><b>Simplicity</b> -- tax payments should be made as easy and as simple as possible for the taxpayer without any loss of clarity.  <p>

<li><b>Limited Bureaucracy and Intrusiveness</b> -- the fewer tax collectors and the more limited their powers the better.<p>

<li><b>Minimize Incentives for Tax Avoidance</b> -- taxes should be low enough and easy enough to comply with so as to not provide significant incentives for avoidance.<p>

<li><b>No Additional Boost to Government Spending</b> -- a tax system's design should not make it any easier for government to increase expenditures.<p>
</ul>
<p>
Our current income tax system scores miserably according to these criteria:<p>
<ul>
<li>Current tax rates are high and progressive -- punishing work, success and the economy.<p>

<li>Capital is taxed, including interest from savings, dividends, and capital gains.  As you know the top capital gains tax rate for individuals stands at 28 percent, and for corporations at 35 percent.<p>

<li>In terms of the inflation factor, the current system is split.  On the positive side, tax rates are indexed so that merely inflationary increases in income no longer push taxpayers into higher tax brackets.  On the negative side, capital gains are not indexed for inflation.  Under such a regime, the <i>real </i>tax rate on capital gains is much higher than the stated rate of 28 percent.  In fact, investors can wind up paying taxes on real capital losses under the current system.  Since one of the major difficulties facing most small businesses is raising capital, high, real capital gains tax rates are particularly detrimental.<p>

<li>Withholding and corporate taxation make the current system quite murky as to who is paying taxes, when, and how much?<p>

<li>As for simplicity, in the accompanying paper I outline just a handful of our current system's many costs and complexities.  Suffice it to say here that I have never met <i>anyone </i>claiming that our current income tax system was simple.<p>

<li>Few, if anyone, also claim that our system allows for a small tax collection bureaucracy or limited government intrusiveness into the private financial affairs of citizens.<p>

<li>The combination of high tax rates and tax law complexities create significant incentives for tax avoidance and evasion.<p>

<li>Finally, the income tax, especially one with high, progressive tax rates, has always acted as high-octane fuel for government spending.<p>
</ul>
<p>
	To the contrary, a low-rate, flat income tax scores very high according to our criteria for a sound tax system.<p>
<ul>
<li>As currently debated, a flat tax system would impose a rate of about 17 percent on all income above a certain level allowed for exemptions.  A 17 percent top tax rate would be the lowest this nation has witnessed since before World War I.  The rewards for working, risk taking, and succeeding would be greatly enhanced.<p>

<li>Capital would not be taxed.  Interest on savings, dividends, and capital gains would not be taxed -- eliminating current double taxation and providing a huge boost to economic growth.  Obviously, incentives for saving, investment, and entrepreneurship would skyrocket, and trillions of dollars would be freed up and made available for investment in new and expanding businesses.<p>

<li>Under a flat-tax-rate scenario with no taxation of capital gains, government possesses few, if any, tax-related reasons to inflate.<p>

<li>If a flat tax eliminates withholding, as Representative Dick Armey's plan would, the true cost of government will become increasingly clear to the average citizen.  Though, by continuing to tax business income, the system would still lack complete clarity, as corporate taxes would be at least partially hidden in the form of lower profits or higher prices.<p>

<li>A low, flat income tax would be vastly simpler than our current system.  Tax compliance costs would plummet.  Resources would be shifted away from tax-related make-work to productive ventures.<p>

<li>As for bureaucracy, the IRS could be greatly downsized as tax complexities evaporate and both individuals and businesses file returns on small index cards.  The potential dangers of government intrusiveness, however, still exist with such an income tax.  The IRS would continue to poke its nose around in the private financial affairs of citizens, but probably to a lessor extent than today.<p>

<li>The combination of a low tax rate and the elimination of deductions and credits, greatly limits incentives for tax avoidance or evasion.<p>

<li>The flat tax would serve as a great improvement over the current system in terms of its impact on government spending.  How so? First, Congress should not only be looking to shift to a flatter tax rate system, but should be looking to provide overall, much-needed tax reduction.  This would assist in limiting spending increases, lowering government's share of GDP, and boosting economic growth.  Second, by ending withholding, the true cost of government will become clearer to taxpayers as they actually sit down and write out a check to the federal government for their tax bill on a monthly or quarterly basis.  Demands for government to economize should drastically increase under such a reform.  Of course, the downside remains that income taxes have always fueled the growth of government, whether at the national, state or local levels -- and the flat tax is still an income tax.<p>
</ul>

Overall, a low-rate, flat income tax would serve as a boon to entrepreneurs, small business, and the economy.  In the short run, there will be a few adjustment pains for some businesses that grew out of various artificial incentives in our current, complex tax code.  But such woes would soon fade away, to be dwarfed by vastly improved incentives for investment and entrepreneurship.  In terms of expanding the pool of available capital, lowering and flattening income tax rates, and tax simplification, make no mistake about it, small business will thrive under such reforms.<p>  

	I would simply add that the lower you can push tax rates the better.  In fact, a flat tax rate of just 10 percent has a nice ring to it.<p>

	Thank you Madam Chairman and Members of the Committee.  On behalf of our small business members nationwide, we appreciate your efforts to study the important issue of tax overhaul.  Both through private conversations with small business owners and surveys, we find that government taxation -- especially federal taxes -- remains the number one concern of business owners.  The Small Business Survival Committee looks forward to working with you and the Committee as you continue to study and hold hearings on the various tax overhaul proposals.  I look forward to answering any questions you may have about my testimony.<p>

<title>President Clinton's Proposal To Increase the Minimum Wage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<center>
<h3>President Clinton's Proposal To Increase the Minimum Wage</h3>
Testimony of Grant Maloy<br>
 Owner Gabriella Growers Oviedo, Florida<p>
Before Joint Economic Committee<br>
U.S. House of Representatives<br>
February 22, 1995<p>
</center>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
Mr. Chairman, members of the Committee. My name is Grant Maloy, owner and operator of Gabriella Growers, a wholesale foliage nursery located near Orlando, Florida. I grow houseplants which are sold throughout the country. I thank the Joint Economic Committee for the opportunity to appear before you today. I think it is vitally important that the United States Congress hear from small business owners and entrepreneurs such as myself, about the impact of proposed government policies on small business. Business owners, like me, are the ones who have to deal with the aftermath of our lawmaker's actions, and I appreciate the Committee giving the small business voice, a voice in this process.<p>

I started my own small business -- it began as a 2,700 square foot greenhouse and today totals 19,000 square feet. One thing that I did not learn in college, was that if you decide to take the plunge into entrepreneurship, the government -will be a roadblock at each stage. The first hurdle starts at the county level, with the last at the federal level. As a small business owner, you face zoning, license, code enforcement, sign restrictions, and fire inspectors from local government. As you move to the state level, worker's compensation, business inspectors, more regulations, fees and taxes. Then, at the federal level there are social security taxes, unemployment taxes, income taxes, OSHA and the list goes on and on.<p>

If it were not for family to help and guide me through the tax and regulatory mazes and hurdles that exist, I probably would have never tried to start a business. And, if I did start one without their help and assistance, there is a good possibility I would have failed. Not because of marketing, sales, or employee problems -- but due to government-imposed barriers.<p>

My business defines what the "small" in small business means. My annual sales totaled $60,000 last year. I began my business from scratch, working parttime at it in 1987, and full-time in 1990. I believe that I represent many ofthe struggling, start-up businesses throughout America.<p>

I oppose an increase in the minimum wage, because it creates just another roadblock for new or expanding small businesses. The market place works, and the academics and bureaucrats in government should stop imposing some artificial wage rate on business, especially when it has been proven that wage tinkering creates additional job loss and hurts those it purportedly is supposed to help.<p>
<h3> <i>The Market Place Works</i></h3>
In my industry, many low-skilled workers are hired. The entry level positions currently pay an average of $5.24 an hour. Competition is strong in the greenhouse industry with wholesale prices remaining nearly the same for over a decade. Yet, wages have increased because of pressure both within the industry and from other industries, as well as the need to keep quality employees.<p>

Employees should be paid based on their productivity and worth, not on some theoretic number selected by politicians for political reasons. I remember two years ago when even President Clinton said that increasing the minimum wage is "the wrong way to raise the incomes of low-wage earnings." Now because of political pressure from organized labor, and new attempts to inflict class warfare into his political strategy, the President has flip-flopped on another key issue of his 1992 campaign.<p>

The laws of economics are as strong as the laws of physics. If you try to bend the rules, you will end up with distortions, and often a disaster. If an employee is not going to produce $4.25 or $5.15 per hour, a business can't afford to pay them that. Persons trying to get their start, and jump onto the economic ladder suffer because they will be unemployed and unskilled. If you take a look at the enormous unemployment rate amongst teenagers and inner-city residents, you will see how the setting of arbitrary wage-rates bears this claim out.<p>

Unfortunately, the real losers of a minimum wage hike will be the individuals whose skills do not allow them to compete successfully for the entry level job.<p>

<h3><i>Hypocrisy of Government Policies</i></h3>

Another reason I am opposed to the minimum wage is due to the fact that it is a hypocritical policy. The government expects a business owner to pay a minimum wage, when the business owner themselves may not make minimum wage.<p>

When I started my business, I was making about $2.00 per hour. I am not complaining because I was sacrificing to pay off a business loan and I was investing in my future. I enjoyed, and still do, the challenge of creating a business and future for myself.<p>

In essence, the minimum wage is just another unfunded mandate from Washington. The President or Congress sets the policy, and then passes the buck. In this case, hard-working small business owner are left to handle the problem.<p>

<h3><i>Government Micro-management</i></h3>

How is it possible that one central government can know what millions of businesses can afford to pay? Economic decisions and business productivity varies from region to region, city to city, etc. It is ludicrous for the government to think it knows what is best for everyone. If this system did work, Congress should raise the minimum wage to $50 per hour, and poverty, presumably,
 would be solved.<p>

Already, government taxes and regulations at all levels cost my business plenty. If I want to expand my business, which I intend to do, and need the help to do it -- I will find less expensive ways to get the work done since I may not be able to afford a new employee at the new wage rate. Increasingly the government is setting up more hurdles to create jobs in this country. On the one hand small businesses have been lamented by the Administration for not doing enough (paying enough, providing health care, etc.) for our employees. At the same time, they are discouraging us, because of proposed policies like the minimum wage hike, to actually employ people.<p>

<h3><i>The Real Problem and Real Solutions</i></h3>

The government's goal should be to protect free enterprise and entrepreneurship. Rather than punish business and success, the government should ask..."How do we increase economic prosperity for all businesses and all workers?"<p>

Prosperity will only increase if Congress removes government-imposed hurdles that are strangling small business and entrepreneurship. If you really want to help small business owners like me the answers are simple: cut taxes, reduce regulations and praise entrepreneurship. Don't bash business.
 Finally, the government can encourage strong families. When I think backto what helped me the most on the road to entrepreneurship, it was not the government or school. It was the experience I received working for my dad's small business, and the encouragement and support
 that my parents gave me.<p>

I do not need more government-imposed rules or regulations on my small business. The government's role should be to protect, preserve and enhance small business. The proposed minimum wage hike flies in the face of these three principles, as well as the message that all Americans are sending government -that it spends, taxes, regulates and meddles too much.<p>

I urge the U.S. Congress to let the minimum wage proposal just remain that -- a proposal. The minimum wage's days have long been numbered, and breathing life into this misguided proposal would not only be bad for small businesses like Gabriella Growers, but bad for the current and future workers of America as well.<p>

Once again I thank the Committee and look forward to answering any questions you may have.<p>

Capital Gains Taxes and the Investment Impact on Small Business

<h3>Capital Gains Taxes and the Investment Impact on Small Business</h3>

Richard W. Rahn, Ph.D.<br>
Member of the Board<br>
Small Business Survival Committee<p>
                              
Before the <br>
 Committee on Small Business<br>
 United States House of Representatives<br>
 February 22, 1995<p>
</center>
<hr>
<p>

     
     Chairman Meyers, members of the Committee, I thank the Small Business
Committee for inviting me to testify before you today on the future of small business in
America, and how the new Congress and the Administration  can begin to further unleash
investment and entrepreneurship in America to sustain long term economic growth and
opportunity.<p>

     I am Richard Rahn, and I am a board member of the Small Business Survival
Committee (SBSC), a 40,000-member nonpartisan, nonprofit, small business advocacy
organization.  I formally served as Vice President and Chief Economist for the United
States Chamber of Commerce, and currently serve as President of Novecon.<p>

     If there is anything in America that represents attainment of the American Dream,
it is owning your own business.  Unfortunately, most small business owners and
entrepreneurs cite their most daunting day-to-day obstacles of running their business as
government-imposed -- namely, taxes and regulations.  The government has become the
main deterrent to small business prosperity and entrepreneurial activity, and I am
encouraged that the 104th Congress is taking proactive steps to lift burdensome policies
and requirements which are stifling economic growth and productivity.<p>

         If enacted, a capital gains tax cut will help to relieve a formidable obstacle faced
by American business -- especially small business.   While I fully support the elimination
of the capital gains tax, the reduction and indexation as proposed in the Contract With
America would result in lower capital costs, increased capital formation, new and higher-paying
jobs, and increased investment in start-up enterprises, as well as business
expansions.<p>
  
     The United States is heavily dependent on its entrepreneurial and small business
sector for its job creating capabilities and technological and innovative breakthroughs. 
The capital gains tax is a direct levy on investment and entrepreneurship, punishing and
discouraging these activities.  It is clear that the U.S. tax policies toward savings and
investment must be revised if we are to retain our country's leading economic role, as
well as retain the necessary status and clout to manage and provide leadership on all
world affair issues.<p>
                                
                                
       <h3>Small Business Investment and Capital Gains Taxes<br>
            Impediment of an Entrepreneurial Economy</h3>

      Too often, risk-takers and entrepreneurs with their promising ideas face a
daunting obstacle in launching a new business -- raising capital.  Business owners with
profitable, growing companies can also hit a brick wall when seeking funding sources to
expand their operations.  The U.S. tax code in its treatment of capital gains, is a major
barrier for such small business owners or emerging entrepreneurs. <p>

     The nation's economic future depends on the success of the entrepreneurial sector. 
Small business is our nation's job-creating machine.  Investment in small business is
critical to our nation.   While SBSC fully supports eliminating the capital gains tax, the
Contract With America proposal which, combined with indexation, reduces the top
capital gains tax rate to 19.8 percent, could be the most pro-growth step taken by the new
Congress.      <p>

     Unfortunately, investment spending in the United States has largely continued on a
downward path over the past 30 to 40 years.  According to a 1994 study by  the American
Council for Capital Formation Center for Policy Research, net annual business investment
in the U.S. has in recent years fallen to only half the level of the 1960s and 1970s.  Net
private domestic investment, according to the same study, averaged 7.4 percent of GDP
from 1960 to 1980.  Since 1991 it has averaged only 3.0 percent.<p>

     Lower investment spending in the U.S. renders less risk-taking and innovation,
diminished productivity, fewer job-creating opportunities and, overall, weakened
economic growth. <p>


     There is no more important economic task than investing both sweat and capital in
new ideas, innovations, and enterprises.  Yet the risky nature of such ventures scares off
bank lending officers.  Therefore, venture capital, whether raised from one's family and
friends or from professional investors, remains a critical source of funding for
entrepreneurial enterprises.  Such investors must determine if they will receive a fair
return on their investment.<p>

     The capital gains tax is a direct levy on investment and entrepreneurship. 
Investment and entrepreneurship are the lifeblood of a vibrant economy and remain the
engines of economic growth and job creation.  The current, non-indexed federal tax rate
of 28 percent on capital gains remains a formidable obstacle to economic expansion,
especially considering the risky nature of investing, and starting and operating a business.<p>

     The potential benefits of reducing and indexing the capital gains tax are clear, and
they will largely benefit small business.  According to the American Council for Capital
Formation, venture capital investment was on the rise as the U.S. capital gains tax rate
declined up to 1986; followed by a dramatic downturn as the rate was hiked 40 percent in
1987, from 20 percent to 28 percent.  Since the 1986 Tax Reform Act raised the capital
gains tax rate by 40 percent, venture capital investment has nose-dived, and federal
capital gains tax revenues have consistently run well below government expectations.  (In
fact,  according to CATO Institute economist Steve Moore, 1991 revenue realizations
equaled $108 billion versus a late-1980's Congressional Budget Office prediction of $269
billion and a Joint Economic Committee prediction of $285 billion.)<p>

     Higher capital gains rates discourage  savings and investment, raising the cost of
available capital.   The effect of higher capital costs means lower levels of investment in
plant and equipment, technology and labor.  As a result, it costs more to produce goods
and services, resulting in higher consumer prices.  Already economies of scale make it
more difficult for small businesses to compete with larger competitors.  The higher cost
of capital, and its resulting inefficiencies, impacts small businesses much more harshly.<p>

     Low capital gains taxes will help lower the cost of capital.  Researchers have
found that a cut in the capital gains tax rate to a range of 15 to 20 percent would reduce
the cost of capital by 4 to 8 percent.   <p>

   <h3>  Indexation of Capital</h3>

     The nominal rate of federal taxation is 28 percent.  However, when inflation is
factored into the capital gains equation the real capital gains tax rate rises substantially. 
The willingness to invest is substantially hindered by taxing capital gains, which are
"specter" earnings spurred by inflation.  <p>

     The lack of indexation creates additional disincentives for investment and
entrepreneurship, restraining small-business growth and job creation.  In fact, some
individuals can wind up paying taxes on real capital losses.  That is, after factoring
inflation into the equation, a nominal profit on a transaction can turn out to be a real loss,
yet the investor still pays taxes on the nominal gains.  Or put more simply, individuals
still pay a substantial capital gains tax even though, after inflation, they receive less from
their sale than they originally paid.  From a "fairness" perspective this is unfair and makes
no economic sense. <p>

     A 28 percent capital gains tax rate acts as a considerable disincentive to
investment, while real rates to even paying taxes on a real capital loss, amount to
economic suicide.  Indexation would eliminate inflation as a factor in capital gains
determination -- equalizing state and real capital gains tax rates.  The lower real rate
would reduce uncertainty, and generate investment, economic growth, and job creation.
     <p>

<h3>     A Capital Gains Tax Cut and the Fairness Issue </h3>

      Opponents who dismiss lowering and/or eliminating capital gains tax rates are
employing class warfare tactics which are based on false assumptions, and make no
economic sense.   Opponents of cutting capital gains taxes contend that this will result in
a cash windfall to the nation's richest while the poor will continue to suffer.  Not only
does reducing/eliminating the capital gains tax make economic sense, but capital gains
tend to be spread across a wider income spectrum than many believe (or want to believe.)<p>

     Based on 1992 federal income tax returns, 56 percent of returns claiming capital
gains were from incomes of $50,000 or less, including the capital gain.  Fully, 83 percent
of returns with capital gains were from total incomes of less than $100,000.<p>

     The precept behind the opposition to a cut in the capital gains tax, is a false belief
in the static nature of our economy and a "black and white" view of the world -- if one
individual wins, then someone else has to lose.   A cut in the capital gains tax will benefit
all investors, and all income classes alike -- rich, middle-class, and lower middle-class --
because it would improve the economy's performance and growth potential.<p>

       Hard-working individuals and entrepreneurs who save and invest their money
wisely are unfairly being punished for that activity.  When high capital gains taxes punish
investors of all income classes by gorging the value of their investments, or watering
them down through the taxation of inflated gains, the response is to consume more now
and  to save and invest less.  Government-imposed barriers to saving and investing hurts
the economy and everyone in it.  The siphoning of productive resources into the
unproductive and wasteful stream of government spending, is what can really be termed
as unfair.<p>

     Governor Lawrence  B. Lindsey, of the Federal Reserve, wrapped up the class
warfare and fairness issue quite directly in a March 20, 1990 Op-Ed in the Washington
Post entitled "Envy is No Basis for Tax Policy":<p>

     The political manipulation of envy is one reason why America has seen its
competitive position in the world economy gradually erode during much of the postwar
period.  There may have been a time when America could afford to waste its resources in
the name of envy, but that is a luxury we can no longer afford. ...The losers from the
pursuit of envy are not only today's wealthy but everyone who benefits from a strong
American economy, both today and in the future.<p>

     If the proponents of higher capital gains taxes were really interested in fairness
they would insist that all losses be deductible in the way that all gains are taxed.  It is
hypocrisy to argue that we need high capital gains taxes for fairness, and then to argue for
limitations on losses.<p>

<h3>     Targeted Capital Gains Tax Cuts</h3>

      Small business, and entrepreneurial activity in general, will benefit from an
across-the-board cut in the capital gains tax.  Targeting a capital gains tax cut to certain
industries assumes that politicians and bureaucrats in Washington can better pick winners
and losers in the marketplace rather than the competitive economy can.  Neither specific
industries, nor smaller versus larger industries, should be "targeted" for the cut.<p>

     In addition to the misguided assumption that the government can and should 
choose what industries should be given favorable tax treatment, the government is further
complicating an already mystifying and convoluted U.S. tax system.  American taxpayers
and most businesses are asking for a less-costly, less-complicated tax system -- not one
that exacerbates its current complexity.<p>

     If a "targeted" approach is enacted, capital may indeed begin to flow to certain
industries, but high capital gains taxes would continue to "lock-in" investors and keep
capital from flowing to its most productive uses.  Increasing the mobility of capital is
important to free investors to pursue all their investment opportunities, not those hand-picked by
the government.  Investment decisions should be based on their merit, not on
U.S. tax policy.<p>

     Targeting a capital gains cut also presents the problem of further politicizing the
U.S. tax code.  Industries from across America will be lobbying Congress for their own
favorable capital gains tax rate to attract investment.  <p>

     The capital gains tax cut in the Contract With America is precisely the type of cut
that the U.S. Congress should enact.     <p>

<h3>     The "Cost-Effectiveness" of the Capital Gains Tax Cut</h3>

     The Committee asked me to comment on the cost-effectiveness of the capital gains
tax cut.  This question assumes that there will be a major "cost" to the federal government
in terms of tax revenues if a capital gains tax cut is enacted -- nothing can be further from
reality.  The question should be, what is the cost to the federal government (in terms of
revenue foregone), and the economy when high capital gains taxes become U.S. tax
policy?<p>

      There is no question that changes in tax rates affect how hard and long people
work and how much they save and invest.  The official revenue-estimating arms of the
government in part ignore how tax policy changes human behavior in making these
calculations.  Indeed, at the heart of the debate in Washington right now is whether
revenue estimators should employ static versus dynamic scoring to determine how much
the Contract's tax cuts will "cost."  This argument is important because static scoring has
created a bias in favor of tax increases and against tax cuts.<p>

     All we need to do is to look at the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and their
track record in revenue estimating to show that indeed, when capital gains tax rates
increased, the CBO failed in its attempt to accurately estimate government revenues. 
When the capital gains tax rate was raised from 20 to 28 percent in 1986, the CBO
forecast that taxable capital gains would rise to $225 billion by 1989.  The actual figure
was $150 billion -- a miscalculation of about 50 percent or $75 billion.<p>

     Between 1988 and 1991, taxable capital gains fell below the 1985 level in every
single year.  By 1991 they were just half of what they were in 1985 (after adjusting for
inflation) and lower than in any year since 1978.  Incredibly, as late as 1988 the CBO was
claiming that its computer simulations showed a "net revenue increase from the 1986
ACT."<p>

     In January of 1990, the CBO again miscalculated its capital gains revenue.  They
estimated that the government would realize $269 billion for 1991.  They missed the
mark by about 150 percent, as the capital gains realization was $108 billion.<p>

     Experience demonstrates that lower capital gains taxes have a beneficial impact on
federal revenues.  If we look at recent t history, the evidence is indisputable.  During the
period of 1978 to 1985 the marginal federal tax rate on capital gains was cut from almost
50 percent to 20 percent.  Total individual capital gains tax receipts increased from $9.1
billion to $26.5 billion.  Capital gains realization swelled to $326 billion in 1986, and
have trended downward ever since the Tax Reform Act of 1986 increased rates.<p>

     In addition to the fact that the federal treasury will gain from a capital gains tax
cut, as noted earlier in my testimony, the entire economy will gain as well.  Freeing
capital to go to its most productive uses, and making capital available to new and growing
businesses far outweighs any so-called "cost" to the federal government.  Not only is
cutting the capital gains tax the most cost-effective jobs program the government can
enact, it will help the United States rapidly regain its competitive edge in the global
economy.  <p>

    <h3> How U.S. Capital Gains Tax Rates Compete Internationally</h3>

     Higher capital gains tax rates undermine our nation's competitiveness while
challenging our status as world economic leader.  The current non-indexed capital gains
tax rate is not competitive internationally.  <p>

     Belgium, Germany, Hong Kong the Netherlands all have a zero rate on long-term
capital gains.  Canada, France, Italy and Sweden have lower capital gains than the U.S.,
with Japan's rate equalling 1 percent of sales price or 20 percent of net capital gain.  Even
the two nation's with higher nominal rates than the United States  --  Australia and the
United Kingdom -- allow for capital gains to be indexed for inflation.  Hence, the U.S.
real capital gains tax rate often will exceed the rate in Australia and the U.K., depending
on U.S. inflation.<p>

     Given the critical and risky nature of investment and entrepreneurship, and the
importance of maintaining a competitive environment in a global economy, capital gains
should be excluded altogether.  A zero capital gains tax rate would ensure that
entrepreneurial risk taking, so crucial to economic growth, would not be impeded by the
U.S. federal tax code.  The fact is the capital gains tax is a double or triple tax because
the income has been taxed at least once before, and in the case of corporate stock, twice
before.  The steps taken in the Contract With America to reduce and index the capital
gains tax rate is a good start.<p>

     
<h3>     Urban and Inner-City Renewal</h3>

     Renewing our inner-cities requires a comprehensive policy approach to resolve the
decay and dysfunction so prevalent in these areas.  In addition to reforming federal tax
and welfare policies that impact inner-city residents, states and cities must also take a
very hard look at their current tax policies, regulatory structures, as well as spending
priorities and inefficiencies to determine how such polices impact job flight and an anti-business
climate.<p>

     However, a capital gains tax cut will indeed free up capital to new and emerging
businesses, many of which do start up in our nation's inner-cities.  As with many new
businesses, fledgling start-ups will be helped by greater access to capital.  Capital is
scarce for most small businesses and entrepreneurs and, as mentioned, a cut in the capital
gains tax will benefit all income classes in all areas.<p>

    <h3> Wages and Interest vs. Capital Gains</h3>

      Opponents of cutting or eliminating capital gains taxes often argue that no reason
exists for differing tax treatments between capital gains and, for example, wage or interest
income.<p>

     In fact, there is a distinct difference between wage or even interest income and
capital gains -- risk.  Capital gains come from growth and appreciation of investments,
which tend to carry greater risks than those associated with earning wages or even
interest.  In particular, investments in small, entrepreneurial ventures carry significant
risk.  As already noted, high-risk ventures must at least present the opportunity for
rewards.<p>

     Another unfairness of the capital gains tax is that the government fully taxes, but severely
limits losses.  This discourages investors from engaging in high risk investments which are often
the most productive.
     
     <h3>Conclusion on Capital Gains Taxes</h3>

     Small business is the engine of economic growth and job creation.  In order to
undertake and/or expand a small business, one needs capital.  Without adequate capital,
new ideas and businesses either never make it to the marketplace or they die a premature
death.  With such deaths go products, services and jobs.  By taking the first step in the
Contract With America, and indexing and reducing the capital gains tax rate, Congress
and the Administration would greatly strengthen incentives for investment and
entrepreneurship -- boosting economic growth and activity.       <p>

     History shows that class warfare does not make for good economic policy.  In fact,
during the 1980's, while tax rates declined, upper-income individuals paid a greater share
of total income taxes, as the benefits of tax shelters declined and the rewards for working,
saving and investment rose.  In this environment, from 1980 to 1989, 18 million jobs
were created.<p>

     The 1986 Tax Reform Act made positive strides by reducing personal and
corporate tax rates, but went awry by trying to "pay" for these reductions with an increase
in the capital gains tax rate.  Indeed, the economy paid a price for this capital gains tax
hike in the form of reduced venture capital investment.<p>

     The time has come to unleash entrepreneurial capitalism by first reducing and
indexing, and then eliminating the capital gains tax.<p>

     Once again I thank the Committee, and look forward to answering any questions you may
have.<p>

<title>Repeal of the Davis-Bacon Act</title>

<h3>Repeal of the Davis-Bacon Act</h3>
Testimony of Karen Kerrigan, President<br>
Small Business Survival Committee<p>

Before the Subcommittee on Workforce Protections <br>
Committee on 
Economic and Educational Opportunities <br>
U.S. House of Representatives<br>
February 15, 1995
</center>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee. My name is Karen Kerrigan, president of the Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC) a 40,000-member nonprofit, nonpartisan small business, grassroots advocacy organization SBSC is also a member of the Coalition to Repeal the Davis-Bacon Act, a diverse coalition of national business associations, state and local governments and citizens groups who share the belief that the Davis-Bacon Act is long overdue for repeal.<p>

SBSC, as well as the Coalition to Repeal the Davis-Bacon Act thank you, Chairman Ballenger, and the Committee for your leadership in holding hearings on this most important issue. For years, hard-working small business owners and lower-income Americans searching for opportunities to jump on the economic ladder have been denied that access in the construction industry due to government-sponsored special interest protectionism. The Davis-Bacon Act fosters the most egregious of distortions, and we appreciate being a part of this forum today to discuss how to alleviate the economic and fiscal damage promoted by the Act, while giving more Americans -- especially within our inner-cities -- a greater chance to take that initial step on the economic ladder.<p>

Imagine for a moment, the following question on a national voter referendum, especially during the past campaign cycle:<p>

Should the United States Congress and President Clinton repeal a regulatory act that denies opportunity to lower-income workers; panders to special interests; claims racist origins; increases cost to taxpayers and the economy; and hurts small business?<p>

The answer, of course, would be a resounding "yes." The Davis-Bacon Act of 1931 does all of the above, and therefore should be repealed.<p>

Passing the Davis-Bacon Act was wrong in 1931 , and keeping it as law is wrong today. New York Representative Robert L. Bacon and Pennsylvania Senator James J. Davis introduced the bill, and President Herbert Hoover signed it -- limiting the benefits of competition, while pandering to organized labor and racism.<p>

By now, most politicians cannot claim ignorance of the racist origins of the 1931 Davis-Bacon Act. The law was introduced and passed to block wage
 competition from black construction workers following an Alabama contractor's successful bid on a federal construction project on New York's Long Island in 1927. The southern contractor employed black construction workers and successfully underbid the local union contractor.<p>

Congressional supporters of the legislation at the time eagerly supported the Act's racial leanings. A through the <i>Congressional Record</i> of 1931 makes this clear. For example, Rep. Clayton Allgood spoke of "cheap colored labor" that is in "competition with white labor throughout the country." Another DavisBacon supporter Rep. John J. Cochran of Missouri said: "I have received numerous cornplaints in recent months about southern contractors employing lowpaid colored mechanics getting work and bringing the employees from the south." Similar references were made by other lawmakers as well.<p>

Just as was the case in 1931, low income earners, especially inner-city minorities, continue to be hurt by the Davis-Bacon Act. Less-skilled, generally non-union workers are denied economic opportunity, as Davis-Bacon inflates wages beyond the point where it makes economic sense for contractors to employ such individuals. In particular, small businesses in inner-cities which are willing to provide critical experience to less-skilled workers are denied that opportunity due to government wage rates that do not reflect economic reality.<p>

The Davis-Bacon Act mandates that a "prevailing wage," usually the union rate, be paid on all federally-funded construction projects. Governmentdetermined "prevailing wages" often well exceed the actual prevailing wages in an area. Many small contractors cannot afford to pay these government-imposed higher wage rates, and are thus shut out of federally-funded 
construction projects.<p>

In an effort that even central planners in the former Soviet Union might have shied away from, the Department of Labor makes tens of thousands of wage determinations annually to guide Davis-Bacon contracts. The "prevailing wage" determination relies heavily on union collective bargaining agreements within a locality. Surveys are rarely conducted, and a "locality" can often mean an enormous geographic region. University of Chicago economist Yale Brozen found the "prevailing wage" for the Appalachian region of Western Pennsylvania set at the same level as Pittsburgh, a city known for its high concentration of union workers.<p>

 Inflated wage rates and rigid job classifications, along with complex and voluminous paperwork requirements demand that firms become less-efficient in order to compete
 for Davis-Bacon contracts.<p>

The paperwork requirements associated with Davis-Bacon take a particularly heavy toll on small contractors. In 1934, the Copeland Act was passed, requiring employers on Davis-Bacon contracts to submit payroll records to the Department of Labor or the contracting agency on a <u>weeklv</u> basis. These weekly certified payroll reports alone cost employers on Davis-Bacon contracts in excess of $100 million per year. The Copeland Act requirement forces many contractors to hire additional clerical employees, invest in additional equipment, and/or alter their payroll schedules. The result: higher costs that discourage or exclude small contractors from bidding on Davis-Bacon contracts.<p>

As these higher costs exclude many small businesses from bidding on Davis-Bacon contracts, costs to taxpayers are pushed even higher due to limited competition.<p>

Minority and women-owned businesses, which predominate among small construction firms, are especially hurt. This is seen most clearly in the innercities, where a large proportion of federal construction dollars is concentrated. In addition, large non-local construction firms that specialize in Davis-Bacon projects undercut small local contractors. Minority and independent contractors cannot compete, due to the inherent inefficiencies and regulatory burdens associated with Davis-Bacon.<p>

Part of the original intent of Davis-Bacon was to protect local workers from contractors outside the region. But the actual effect is often to protect outside union labor from competition from local, but non-union, workers. On Davis-Bacon projects you will often find out-of-town union journeymen performing work that could easily be done by local non-union workers.<p>

With small and minority contractors shut out from bidding on federal construction projects, minorities in the inner-cities are shut out from job opportunities as well. If contractors are forced to pay one "prevailing wage" they will always chose the already skilled worker, restricting availability for job opportunities. Often, many unemployed individuals are prevented from working on projects in their own neighborhood.<p>

 Wages are best determined in a competitive marketplace, not according to the unrealistic estimates from government bureaucrats in Washington, D.C. The market allows wages and costs to adjust according to a host of criteria, including competition, skill levels and productivity, demand, supply, capital investment, et al. The Davis-Bacon Act's wage criteria distort the marketplace, artificially favoring large businesses over small, entrepreneurial firms; and higher-skilled and higher-paid workers over less-experienced, lower-skilled workers, regardless of job criteria.<p>

Lack of competition, increased paperwork, and inflated wages mean higher costs for taxpayers and the economy. According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) in 1994, if Davis-Bacon were repealed federal taxpayers would conservatively save $3.1 billion over the following five years. Allowing the use of helpers, or semi-skilled workers would save an additional $500 million a year, bringing total savings from repeal to nearly $6 billion over five years. The Davis-Bacon Act inflates the cost of federal construction by an average of 5 percent to 15 percent. And, the GAO and CBO estimates do not include the costs of foregone competition -- raising the total cost of Davis-Bacon even higher.<p>

Local officials have estimated that Davis-Bacon increased the cost of various community development projects by 20 percent to 50 percent. Also, an Oregon State University study estimated cost inflation on federally-funded construction contracts in rural areas of 26 percent to 38 percent due to the Davis-Bacon Act.<p>

From a fiscal accountability perspective, as well as a moral one, there remains no sound reason to hold onto this legislative relic from the past. At a time when American taxpayers are demanding less and more efficient government, nothing more fully symbolizes a wasteful, meddling Washington than the Davis-Bacon Act. Symbolically and substantively, Davis-Bacon represents the distorted outcome of special interest protectionism. And, most pathetically, its original intent of preventing those who wish to jump on the economic ladder continues to this day.<p>

From a small business perspective, Davis-Bacon makes it impossible for union-free, efficient contractors to bid on federally-funded construction projects. We urge all members of Congress to further unleash the entrepreneurial spirit in every corner of America by repealing the 1931 Davis-Bacon Act.<p>

Thank you for the opportunity to testify before you today.<p>

<h3>Savings and Investment Provisions in the Contract With America</h3>
Karen Kerrigan<br>
President<br>
Small Business Survival Committee<p>

Before the <br>
Committee on Ways and Means<br>
United States House of Representatives<br>
January 24, 1995
</center>
</p>
<hr>
<p>     
     Chairman Archer, I would like to thank the Ways and Means Committee for inviting the
Small Business Survival Committee to testify before you today on the future of small business in
America, and how the new Congress and the Administration  can begin to further unleash
investment and entrepreneurship in America to sustain long term economic growth and
opportunity.<p>

     The Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC) is a 40,000-member nonpartisan,
nonprofit advocacy organization fighting against the growing burden of taxation and regulation
on American small business and individuals. Members of SBSC represent a diversity of small
businesses and enterprises across America.  From home-based businesses, to traditional "mom
and pop" businesses, to small manufacturers, to 1995 entrepreneurs and others -- SBSC's
membership is as diverse as the small business sector itself.<p>

     <i>If there is anything in America that represents attainment of the American Dream, it
is owning your own business</i>.  Unfortunately, most small business owners and entrepreneurs
cite their most daunting day-to-day obstacles of running their business as government-imposed --
namely, taxes and regulations.  We hear little about traditional business-related hurdles regarding
sales, marketing, motivating employees, or topics that also require tremendous time and
resources from the owner.  Government has become the main obstacle to small business
prosperity, and not surprisingly more and more Americans do not view their government as
protector of our great free enterprise system.<p>

         Beyond the twin burdens of taxes and regulations which are slowly strangling
productive entrepreneurial activity, the United States non-indexed capital gains tax creates
another impediment for entrepreneurs wishing to start-up or expand an enterprise.  The federal
government needs to encourage, not punish, private-sector investment. <p>

<h3>Eliminating Capital Gains Taxes:
Lifeblood for an Entrepreneurial Economy</h3>

      Most entrepreneurs seeking to start up or expand an enterprise will tell you of a major
obstacle -- raising capital.  Encouragement for private-sector investment in small business needs
to be enhanced.  While SBSC fully supports eliminating the capital gains tax, the Contract With
America proposal which, combined with indexation, reduces the top capital gains tax rate to
19.8 percent, could be the most pro-growth step taken by the new Congress.      <p>

     There is no more important economic task than investing both sweat and capital in new
ideas, innovations, and enterprises.  Yet the risky nature of such ventures scares off bank lending
officers.  Therefore, venture capital, whether raised from one's family and friends or from
professional investors, remains a critical source of funding for entrepreneurial enterprises.<p>

     The capital gains tax is a direct levy on investment and entrepreneurship.  Investment and
entrepreneurship are the lifeblood of a vibrant economy and remain the engines of economic
growth and job creation.  The current, non-indexed federal tax rate of 28 percent on capital gains
remains a formidable obstacle to economic expansion, especially considering the risky nature of
investing, and starting and operating a business.<p>

     The potential benefits of reducing and indexing the capital gains tax are clear.  Venture
capital investment was on the rise as the U.S. capital gains tax rate declined up to 1986; followed
by a dramatic downturn as the rate was hiked 40 percent in 1987, from 20 percent to 28 percent. 
Since the 1986 Tax Reform Act raised the capital gains tax rate by 40 percent, venture capital
investment has nose-dived, and federal capital gains tax revenues have consistently run well
below government expectations.  In fact,  according to CATO economist Steve Moore, 1991
revenue realizations (most recent available) equaled $108 billion versus a late-1980's
Congressional Budget Office prediction of $269 billion and a Joint Economic Committee
prediction of $285 billion.<p>

<h3>How the U.S. Stacks Up Internationally </h3>

 In the new global economy, it is imperative that the United States be competitive with other nation's on the capital gains front -- the U.S.needs to be a haven and magnet for capital.  The current non-indexed capital gains tax rate is not
competitive internationally.  Belgium, Germany, Hong Kong the Netherlands all have a zero rate
on long-term capital gains.  Canada, France, Italy and Sweden have lower capital gains than the
U.S., with Japan's rate equalling 1 percent of sales price or 20 percent of net capital gain.  Even
the two nation's with higher nominal rates than the United States  --  Australia and the United
Kingdom -- allow for capital gains to be indexed for inflation.  Hence, the U.S. real capital gains
tax rate often will exceed the rate in Australia and the U.K., depending on U.S. inflation.       
<p>

    <i> Given the critical and risky nature of investment and entrepreneurship, and the
importance of maintaining a competitive environment in a global economy, capital gains should
be excluded altogether.  A zero capital gains tax rate would ensure that entrepreneurial risk
taking, so crucial to economic growth, would not be impeded by the U.S. federal tax code.  The
steps taken in the Contract With America to reduce and index the capital gains tax rate is a good
start.</i><p>

   <h3>  Indexation</h3>

The nominal rate of federal taxation is 28 percent.  However, when
inflation is factored into the capital gains equation the <i>real</i> capital gains tax rate rises
substantially.<p>

     The lack of indexation creates additional disincentives for investment and
entrepreneurship, restraining small-business growth and job creation.  In fact, some individuals
can wind up paying taxes on real capital losses.  That is, after factoring inflation into the
equation, a nominal profit on a transaction can turn out to be a real loss, yet the investor still
pays taxes on the nominal gains.  Real rates of capital gains taxation represent severe
impediments to keeping America's economy vibrant and growing.<p>

     Figure 1 below offers an example of how inflation can impact capital gains tax rates. 
Listed below are the real capital gains tax rates from 1977 through 1993 on three-year
investments yielding a total nominal return of 30 percent.  (It is assumed that the investment is
closed out at the end of the stated year, for example, the 1985 real capital gains tax rate to an
investment made at the beginning of 1983 and sold at the end of 1985.)<p>

     A 28 percent capital gains tax rate acts as a considerable disincentive to investment,
while real rates ranging from 40 percent to 494 percent to even paying taxes on a real capital
loss, amount to economic suicide.  Indexation would eliminate inflation as a factor in capital
gains determination -- equalizing state and real capital gains tax rates.  The lower real rate would
reduce uncertainty, and generate investment, economic growth, and job creation.
     <p>

<h3>     Who Benefits?</h3>

  Opponents who engage in class warfare rhetoric to dismiss lowering and
eliminating capital gains tax rates are employing tactics which the American public, quite 
frankly, is sick of hearing.  "Soak-the-rich" schemes and "fair-share" arguments will continue to
backfire on those who feel they can defeat the issue on these divisive grounds.  Not only does
reducing/eliminating the capital gains tax make sense, but capital gains tend to be spread across a
wider income spectrum than many believe.  Based on 1992 federal income tax returns, 56
percent of returns claiming capital gains were from incomes of $50,000 or less, including the
capital gain.  Fully, 83 percent of returns with capital gains were from total incomes of less than
$100,000.<p>

     <h3>Wages and Interest vs. Capital Gains </h3>

In addition to false assumptions about the identification of capital gains just with the wealthy, opponents of cutting or eliminating capital gains taxes often argue that no reason exists for differing tax treatments between capital gains
and, for example, wage or interest income.<p>

     In fact, there is a distinct difference between wage or even interest income and capital
gains -- risk.  Capital gains come from growth and appreciation of investments, which tend to
carry greater risks than those associated with earning wages or even interest.  In particular,
investments in small, entrepreneurial ventures carry significant risk.  As already noted, high-risk
ventures must at least present the opportunity for rewards.<p>

     <h3>Conclusion on Capital Gains</h3>

 Small business is the engine of economic growth and
job creation.  In order to undertake and/or expand a small business, one needs capital.  Without
adequate capital, new ideas and businesses either never make it to the marketplace or they die a
premature death.  With such deaths go products, services and jobs.  By taking the first step in the
Contract With America, and indexing and reducing the capital gains tax rate, Congress and the
Administration would greatly strengthen incentives for investment and entrepreneurship --
boosting economic growth and activity.       <p>

     History shows that class warfare does not make for good economic policy.  In fact,
during the 1980's, while tax rates declined, upper-income individuals paid a greater share of total
income taxes, as the benefits of tax shelters declined and the rewards for working, saving and
investment rose.  In this environment, from 1980 to 1989, 18 million jobs were created.<p>

     The 1986 Tax Reform Act made positive strides by reducing personal and corporate tax
rates, but went awry by trying to "pay" for these reductions with an increase in the capital gains
tax rate.  Indeed, the economy paid a price for this capital gains tax hike in the form of reduced
venture capital investment.<p>

     The time has come to unleash entrepreneurial capitalism by first reducing and indexing,
and then eliminating the capital gains tax.<p>

 <h3>   Entrepreneurial Incentives in the Contract With America</h3>

      As noted extensively in addressing the importance of reducing, eliminating and indexing
the capital gains tax, individuals respond to tax and savings incentives having a profound impact
on robust and sustained economic growth.  Policy makers need also to look a the changing
nature of the economy.  Home-based businesses, for example, are booming.  Clarifying the
deduction for home-offices recognizes our changing work force while reducing questions
regarding who qualifies and who does not.<p>

     Increasing the estate tax exemption from $600,000 to $750,000 helps small businesses
pass on a family-owned enterprise to the next generation -- the U.S. tax code should not penalize
families for wanting to keep a business in the family.<p>

     The small business expensing provision in the Contract encourages investment by
allowing small businesses to deduct the first $25,000 in equipment and inventory.  All of the
above are good steps to help "prime the pump" for small business growth.<p>

     The U.S. tax code needs to encourage savings in America -- increased savings provides
more capital for investment in small businesses and the future of America.  The American Dream
Savings Account provision in the Contract  permits individuals to contribute up to $2,000 into a
special savings account.  Promoting savings in America will strengthen our country's economic
base and encourage savings.<p>

     Small business, and the entrepreneurial spirit that drives America, continues to be a
constant in our economy -- past, present and future.  The U.S. government, whose job it is to
protect and preserve America's free enterprise system, has unfortunately become a foe of the
private sector.  Reforming the tax system so businesses and individuals make decisions on
economic merit rather than tax law is an essential component of free enterprise.<p>

     The Small Business Survival Committee salutes the 104th Congress and the Ways and
Means Committee for its leadership in not only determining how the government can further
encourage savings and investment, but also for beginning to look at America's tax system in its
entirety and how the government can efficiently and fairly collect taxes from its citizens without
eroding individual freedom, or America's free enterprise system.<p>

Carolan &amp; Keating &#173;&#173 - December 16, 1996<BR>
Stunning Account of the Great Villain<BR>
<P></h2>
<h3>
by Matthew Carolan and Raymond J. Keating<BR>

<p>
<br><blockquote>

Have you ever wondered what Nelson Rockefeller did before he wrecked
New York's economy?  Well, author Cary Reich provides all of the
answers in his new book The Life of Nelson A. Rockefeller: Worlds
to Conquer 1908&#173;1958.
<P>
This biography of the former New York governor and vice president
of the United States deservedly rated as a National Book Award
finalist.  Indeed, The Life of Nelson A. Rockefeller is crisply
written and well researched.  
<P>
While a massive tome at almost 800 pages, it is just the first
of a two&#173;part work.  In fact, before cracking the book open,
we were a bit leery with the idea of dedicating so much paper
to someone like Rockefeller &#173;&#173; our least favorite governor
of New York (with Mario Cuomo naturally running a very close next&#173;to&#173;last).
 However, now we cannot wait until the second volume lands in
book stores next year.
<P>
This book covers Rockefeller's life up to the point when he handily
won the 1958 New York gubernatorial contest.  So we must wait
for part two to read about how Rockefeller &#173;&#173; through
a massive expansion of state government, myriad borrowing shenanigans,
and destructive tax increases &#173;&#173; set New York firmly
on the track to economic oblivion.  In the meantime, one requires
a host of valuable insights about Rockefeller's pre&#173;Albany
days.  
<P>
The reader gains a portrait of an individual with boundless energy,
enthusiasm and wealth.  Far too often, though, Rockefeller's enthusiasms
clouded his judgment.  Perhaps this proved most obvious while
serving in the administration of Franklin Delano Roosevelt.  
<P>
FDR tapped Rockefeller's expertise on Latin America, with Rockefeller
eventually serving as an assistant secretary of state.  During
these years, Rockefeller became completely obsessed with establishing
close ties and a united front among all the nations of the Americas
&#173;&#173; not terribly controversial on the face of it, except
for the fact that Rockefeller was more than willing to overlook
Argentina's pro&#173;Nazi regime.  Rockefeller almost appeared
as an appeaser when it came to Argentina.  As the war came to
an end, Rockefeller and the U.S. administration received much
deserved criticism for their less&#173;than&#173;tough stance
toward Argentina.
<P>
Another controversial enthusiasm of Rockefeller's was given birth
while serving under FDR.  He discovered the off&#173;budget government
corporation, and modified it so that these entities were accountable
to no one but himself and FDR, who simply received an annual report.
 
<P>
Years later, after he became governor of New York, Rockefeller
set up dozens of off&#173;budget public corporations, or authorities,
in order to avoid state constitutional limits on borrowing, namely,
voter approval of long&#173;term state debt.  Reich reveals that
as a student at Dartmouth, Rockefeller was interested in the pyramids.
 The government corporation allowed him to finance grand government
building projects &#173;&#173; as useless and almost as massive
as the pyramids.
<P>
Still, even though he enthusiastically sold foreign aid as a cure
for what ailed Latin America, prior to his reign as New York's
governor, Rockefeller's enthusiasms for big government remained
at least somewhat camouflaged.  Indeed, when necessary Rockefeller
could offer arguments and speeches on capitalism so moving that
they probably brought a tear to the eye of Milton Friedman.  However,
practically all of Rockefeller's actions while serving in government
showed him to be a hard&#173;left New Dealer at heart.  Rockefeller
may have spoken glowingly of the marketplace on occasion, but
he believed in the power of government action.  
<P>
Rockefeller was a disciple of his fellow New Yorker FDR.  As Reich
puts it: &quot;Roosevelt was a mentor, an adviser, and a role
model.&quot;  One might be able to forgive FDR for his big&#173;government
escapades, having been knocked silly by the Great Depression.
 Rockefeller had no such excuse years later in New York.
<P>
New York conservatives proved prescient.  As Reich notes, conservative
Republicans always eyed Rockefeller leerily, and as it turned
out for good reason.  But for all the damage wrought by Rockefeller,
the rise of conservatism in the 1960s owed much to him.  While
Ronald Reagan would provide conservatives with something to be
for, Rockefeller gave them something to be against.  
<P>
Reich notes this fact: &quot;Indeed, it would be fair to say that
conservatism would not have advanced so relentlessly had it not
been for Nelson Rockefeller.  In Bill Rusher's words, 'Every movement
needs a villain.  For the GOP right, Nelson Rockefeller was it.'
...  Hatred of Nelson Rockefeller, for the right, became a uniquely
binding force.  The final mordant irony of Rockefeller's life
in politics is this: while he never achieved the Age of Rockefeller,
he may well have brought about the Age of Reagan.&quot;  
<P>
Conservative hatred of Rockefeller lives on, but it is a healthy,
well&#173;warranted hatred.  Get labeled a Rockefeller Republican
and your chances for advancement in today's GOP (outside of New
York, that is) are probably quite slim.  C&amp;K heartily recommend
The Life of Nelson A. Rockefeller as a last minute Christmas present.
 It pays to know thy enemy.

<h2>
Carolan & Keating - December 9, 1996<br>
Poor Over&#173;Worked and Under&#173;Paid State Legislators<BR>
<p>
</h2>
<h3>
by Matthew Carolan and Raymond J. Keating<BR>
</h3></center>
<P>
<br><blockquote>

Many of us apparently don't realize how grueling the job of a
New York state legislator really can be.  In recent weeks, some
legislators are telling anyone who will listen how &quot;stressful&quot;
and &quot;hectic&quot; their jobs are.  They pat themselves on
the back, and declare that they all &quot;work hard.&quot;  And
because they slave so arduously, these public servants plan to
give themselves a pay raise.
<P>
How reassuring.  We must have been deluded to think legislators
are lavishly compensated, while their efforts are wasteful and
incompetent.  
<P>
For example, it costs a little more than $1 million per office
to run the state senate and more than $500,000 per office for
the assembly.  These not insubstantial amounts pay for large staffs,
cars, public relations apparatuses, multiple offices, et al. 
Indeed, the New York state legislature employs more than 4,000
bureaucrats.  It must be very time consuming for legislators to
manipulate all these resources so that taxpayers fail to detect
the utter waste involved.  
<P>
And then, of course, there's all that pandering to whiners and
special interests.  Assemblyman Tony Seminerio of Queens reportedly
said he deserves a pay raise because he puts &quot;a lot of time
in&quot; and has &quot;a lot of responsibility.&quot;  Seminerio
was recently quoted: &quot;It's a quarter after five and I'm still
here.  I'm waiting for a constituent, who will probably be here
at 20 to six.  Tonight I have two meetings to go to.&quot;  How
does tired Tony do it?  After all, none of the rest of us have
ever worked all the way to 6:00 pm, and then had work commitments
later in the evening, right?  In addition, most of those evening
&quot;meetings&quot; for elected officials involve cocktails,
appetizers, dinner, and meeting people who will fill their campaign
coffers.  It must be brutal.  
<P>
One has to wonder why tired Tony and other complainers in the
state legislature don't flee the extreme pressures and low pay
of elected office and get a cushy private sector job.  Why come
back election after election, if things are so tough?  Instead,
they could do something real easy, like start a business; produce
a service or product people actually want; wrestle with onerous
state taxes, regulations and bureaucrats; and only work 18 hours
a day for six or seven days a week.  
<P>
Interestingly, some state legislators actually do have their own
businesses &#173;&#173; that is, if you can call being a law partner
having a business.  Wow, Superman stand aside!
<P>
These poor gals and guys in the legislature have not gotten a
raise since 1989.  Golly, how can they keep up with the rising
cost of living?  We suppose the fact that the job of state legislator
is a part&#173;time position is to be ignored.  Also, that New
York state legislators are the second highest paid in the nation,
only recently surpassed by California, must be set aside.  Additional
lulus (i.e., stipends) for most legislators, worth anywhere from
$6,500 up to $30,000 annually, awarded for doing their jobs and
staying in line politically, cannot be considered.  Expense reimbursements
for being in Albany, worth just under $100 per day on average,
must be pooh&#173;poohed as well.  
<P>
In addition, we should turn a deaf ear to an increase in state
legislator's base bay from $32,960 in 1984 to $57,500 today &#173;&#173;
when adjusted for inflation, a better than 15 percent increase.
 Add in the aforementioned lulus, and the average part&#173;time
state legislator garners about $70,000 per year.
<P>
Lastly, we assume that no link between pay and productivity should
be made at all.  Little lapses in job performance should be overlooked,
like chronically late budgets; high taxes; bloated, inefficient
and wasteful government; over&#173;regulation; state debt gimmicks,
led by off&#173;budget public authorities, designed to skirt the
State Constitution; and a government patronage mill.
<P>
If we ignore all these many factors, then New York state legislators
deserve a pay raise.  However, if we cannot overlook such lapses
&#173;&#173; for both ethical and economic reasons &#173;&#173;
then New York legislators deserve a massive pay cut.
<P>
Perhaps the time has come for serious reforms that will make the
New York state legislature a citizens' body, rather than a body
of lifetime politicians.  The framers of the State Constitution
had such a notion in mind when they required that a legislature
could not vote a pay raise for itself.  A pay raise can only take
effect for the next legislature.  Today, however, the next legislature
is largely the same as the current and previous legislatures.
<P>
Two reforms are needed.  First, require that all pay raises in
the state of New York, whether for state or any local elected
officials, pass muster with the voters before being implemented.
 Second, institute term limits in New York.  Eight years for both
legislators and the governor &#173;&#173; and why not local officials
as well &#173;&#173;  should be sufficient.
<P>
Not only would New York gain a true citizens' legislature, but
poor Tony Seminerio and his over&#173;worked legislative colleagues
would be released from their current back&#173;breaking duties.
 It's the least we can do for these suffering souls.

<h2>
Carolan & Keating - December 2, 1996<br>
The Recycling Grinch<BR>
<P>
</h2>
<h3>
 by Matthew Carolan &amp; Raymond J. Keating<BR>
</h3></center>
<P><br><blockquote>

     By all objective standards, recycling is more expensive and
more wasteful of natural resources than sending solid waste to
a landfill.  A fact to remember this holiday season as you wash,
sort, and cart back to the supermarket those extra bottles and
cans to recover your nickels.
<P>
     Don't get us wrong.  We support recycling bottles and cans,
when it makes economic sense and is done voluntarily by private
businesses.  But forced, government recycling is an inefficient,
costly response to manufactured landfill scares.  
<P>
     Despite their haphazard appearance, modern landfills are
quite advanced.  Because of numerous government safety regulations,
landfills must be lined and covered with special protective layers
to prevent seepage of toxins into the air and water supply.  They
must also monitor and remove any gasses that can accumulate inside
the landfill.
<P>
     Ignorance of these and other landfill features abound, as
does the belief that there is a &quot;shortage&quot; of landfill
space.  Currently, space devoted to landfilling American waste
amounts to a volume one hundred yards deep by two&#173;thirds
of a mile square per year.  By the year 3000, according to Clark
Wiseman of Gonzaga University, given packaging innovation and
other factors, all the garbage of the United States will be able
to fit in a landfill 100 yards deep and 35 miles square, or less
than half that if it were compacted.
<P>
     So why are politicians closing landfills, and even using
wasteful bond acts and long term debt to do so?  Why are they
paying more to boost recycling, and ship trash out of state? 
<P>
     It is because in any policy debate over politically incorrect
things like landfills, where greater efficiency and lower prices
are diffused throughout society, such gains are often defeated
by a smaller group, who persuade the political class to protect
their own perceived special interests.  One example is the NIMBY&#173;types
(not in my backyard), and another the environmental lobbyists,
whose global aesthetic appeals undercut the importance of a strong
economy in providing a clean and healthy environment.
<P>
     Some communities, like Charles City County, Va., recognize
that the public good is a more complex equation.  As reported
by John Tierney in a recent New York Times Sunday Magazine, Charles
City County receives waste from New York City, which pays to send
it out of state.  In Charles City County, jobs are plentiful,
the environment is healthy, and the students have new computers
in their schools thanks to the influx of trash cash.  In contrast,
New York City, as Tierney wryly points out, has lots of environmentalist
indoctrination in the classroom, but an otherwise crumbling educational
infrastructure.
<P>
     New York in fact is now learning the expensive lesson that
when you eliminate the cheapest way to dispose of waste, you begin
to see increasingly baroque misdirections of public energy and
a piling on of costs.
<P>
      Take the costs you bear for your bottled beverages. You
pay hidden costs, which can amount to as much as seven cents per
container, because the supermarket must now administer the deposit,
run machines to crush the bottles and cans, and pay the kid to
clean up all the plastic bags dripping with soda or beer.  You
pay costs for the distributors to administer the program as well.
<P>
     Then, add in the cost of additional taxes you pay to your
local government who recycle almost everything &#173;&#173; except
your plastic bottles and aluminum cans (the only valuable stuff
to recycle) due to the deposit law.  You trudge back to the store
while the municipality loses tens of millions, or in New York
City, hundreds of millions per year (including millions in water
and fuel oil to wash garbage) recovering items worth nowhere near
what it costs to recycle them.   It all translates into more local
taxes.
<P>
     You can thank the great impresario of baroque government,
Mario Cuomo, for some of this absurd inefficiency.  The simple
repeal of his 1983 bottle deposit law would at least cut the losses
of municipal recycling programs.
<P>
     But why stop there?  In the spirit of the holidays, when
we all want to save time and money, let's do more than go to the
store for the big sale.  Let's call our local government bean
counters, and tell them to audit our recycling programs.  A clear
look at the books will show that the government, like a Green
Grinch, is stealing the money, the presents, the soft drinks,
even the oil and hot water from our Christmas.

Carolan & Keating - November 25, 1996<br>
The Germtooth Letters<BR>
<P>
</h2>
<h3>
by Matthew Carolan and Raymond J. Keating<BR>
</h3></center>
<P>
<br><blockquote>

     Several decades past, one of this century's greatest Christian
apologists, C.S. Lewis, published his remarkable reports on secret
correspondence taking place between certain agents of evil from
the netherworld.  The Screwtape Letters, as it was called, shocked
an entire generation.
<P>
     Today, Carolan &amp; Keating have &#173;&#173; through certain
spiritual sources &#173;&#173; obtained copies of similar correspondence
between entities stationed in New York.  One such message is reprinted
here for your edification: <BR><p>
<HR WIDTH=30% ALIGN=left SIZE=3>
<P>
Thursday, 11/21
<P>
My Dear Germtooth,<BR>

<P>
     I have received your message, and I'm a bit disappointed.
 Your promotion to Secretary of Infernal Affairs in the Second
District means you are eminently qualified to deliver many souls
to our Father Below.  But if so simple a holiday as Thanksgiving
is enough to frighten you, as it seems to do every year, then
may I suggest you return to us immediately, so that I may devour
you with stuffing.
<P>
     While Thanksgiving is nauseating, its acknowledgment of the
enemy is usually only temporary.  True, there are little inklings
of guilt throughout the season, and we watch with some concern
as many of our choice morsels stray back to religious services
for a day or two.
<P>
     But if you have laid the groundwork well, the slothful soul
will not stay long, sensing that his cherished &quot;freedom&quot;
is threatened by archaic moral commandments.  You can count on
him to eventually opt for one of our own non&#173;threatening
bait religions,
or return to his own &quot;private spirituality.&quot;  I do enjoy
a soul so richly basted in its own pride.
<P>
     As you surely know, the holiday provides us with other excellent
opportunities.  Gluttonous intemperance during the holiday season
can be nurtured through the new year into a scrumptious array
of sensuality and fornication, usually by summer.
<P>
     And don't forget how many delicious family squabbles can
be started by simply reminding your subject that the holiday must
be a perfect day, which is impossible, and then upsetting him
so upon seeing one's father in an ugly tie.  Many a fine assault,
or in ideal cases, a murder, has been enjoyed on this holiday
thanks to a bad tie.
<P>
     Here's an excellent recipe to exploit before dinner:  Take
a pound of natural hunger, mix with a pinch of apprehension over
being judged by others, or a slice of personal vanity.  Spill
one glass of wine, and add a few harsh words.  Garnish with sour
faces, and a sprig of old resentments.  Flambe according to taste.
 C'est manifique.
<P>
     After football, and hopefully a Cowboys' victory, I like
to save some scraps for later enjoyment.  Try this.  First, melt
down the subject's guilt from overeating into a simpler form,
then work it into a froth during a news report on the starving
in Rwanda.  Keep him focused on how uncaring the world is while
folding in generous portions of pride with his own charity.  This
produces a flaky, puffed up compassion; so great that the subject
loves
humanity, but is unable to care for the man in his office or the
child across the street.  Thus will he more easily condemn others
for having too much, which is always tasty.  This recipe was first
brought over to Greenwich Village, but is now also very popular
at the Capital, and in some Chancery offices.
<P>
     Speaking of the Capital, you are doing a fine job overseeing
the production of delicious morsels for our consumption.  We are
still reheating the last governor you sent us in that delightful
inflagrante delicto sauce.  
<P>
     And those hollow&#173;core legislators you have been sending!
 What a remarkable medley of amoral immorality!  SlubGob swears
it cannot be done by simple political compromise, no matter how
much you whip it.  You must send us the recipe.
<P>
     Of course, the enemy would have us and those mortals believe
He would be able to fully satisfy us, which would of course make
eternity dreadfully boring.  Surely there has to be some kind
of challenge.
<P>
     But our victims, despite their fallen state, retain this
absurd belief in final satisfaction.  Indeed, we would not enjoy
them so much if they didn't, redirecting that hope as we do into
the political system, which promises to give &quot;security,&quot;
and &quot;prosperity.&quot;  Once we have taken that hope away
from Him, the enemy, and directed into him, or him, or her, it
is amazing how we can turn them against each other, and into our
waiting claws.  <BR>

<P>
Ravenously yours,
<P>
HairBug

Carolan & Keating - November 11, 1996<BR>
Bond Act on the Brain and Time for Big Al's Exit
<BR>
</h2>
<P>
<h3>
by Matthew Carolan and Raymond J. Keating<BR>
</h3>
</center>
<P>
<BR>
<blockquote>
<DD><FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>he scene is a Manhattan hotel on election night at five minutes to nine.  Governor George Pataki is questioned about the Dole campaign by a local reporter. He answers by talking about the importance of his environmental bond act.  
<P>
Pataki is asked the question again.  The answer, once more, relates to the bond act.  When pressed another time, Pataki explains that the Dole camp "pulled out of New York about a month ago," so there was nothing that could be done.  Then, the Governor returns to the bond act.
<P>     
Those who read this column know that we have been generally supportive of George Pataki. We believe his tax cuts, for example, are a vital step to regaining New York's economic health.  We applaud Pataki's efforts to reform the worker's compensation system and lifting some regulations in the health-care arena.  But the Governor's behavior these past few months -- his myopic campaigning for the pork-barrel bond act especially -- raises serious doubts about both his strategic thinking and leadership regarding conservative ideas. 
<P>     
Forget the Dole campaign, which had it's own problems.  But what about the State Assembly races?  For months, many conservatives and Republicans have argued that winning the Assembly was vital to getting smaller government in New York.  Yet, with barely a peep from the Governor this fall, the GOP actually lost a few seats in the state legislature overall.
<P>     
Perhaps we should have seen the lack of leadership coming. Recall that last year, during another delayed budget, the Governor failed to bring that fight for smaller government to the mass media.  Now the Governor has traded his shot at a majority in the Assembly for personal image polishing with the Greens.  He is also rarely seen in Albany.  Such clear lack of strategic focus or zeal at the top of the GOP is surely not lost on Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, Democrat Chairwoman Judith Hope, or the handful of Democrats who seem eager to run for governor in 1998.
<P>
<HR WIDTH=30% ALIGN=left SIZE=3>
<P>
 <DD><FONT SIZE=+2>I</FONT>s it our imagination or does Senator Al D'Amato become less and less subtle about his political opportunism with each passing day?
<P>    
After Bill Clinton scored big in New York, including heavily Republican Nassau County, Senator Al D'Amato made a remarkably transparent attempt to mend his reputation by suggesting maybe it's time to call a truce on Whitewater.  What irony, the most political Republican of all now reinforces the perception that the Whitewater investigations were always political by calling them off after the election.  This leaves the rest of D'Amato's party to answer the false charge of politicization, leading one Republican staffer to comment "Typical D'Amato. CYA." (Cover your a--).  
<P>
D'Amato performed a similar turnabout on primary night earlier this year.  After victoriously using the New York GOP's rigged primary rules for his own candidate, D'Amato called for eliminating those very rules in favor of a more open system.
<P>
     D'Amato's brazenness lies in the fact that everything he touches is political.  He poisoned Whitewater. He poisoned the bond act. He has poisoned George Pataki's reputation.  Nothing Al D'Amato does or says can be taken at face value.  Everything must be scrutinized for its underlying meaning.  Next time he holds a press conference to announce he's in love, listen carefully, there may be federal funding involved.
<P>     
We just wonder how much longer the GOP family will put up with brazen Al D'Amato.  How many losing candidates this year, for example, will work hard for King Al's re-election in 1998 after he left them to twist in the wind while he hawked the bond act?  Will many of these same local hacks continue to say "Yes boss," while enduring another of D'Amato's acid phone calls?
<P>
However, it's simply not a question of process with D'Amato any longer.  His political judgment must come into serious question in 1996, after appearing so astute in 1994.  After all, D'Amato led the early charge for Bob Dole.  D'Amato lined up every elected New York Republican official (barring Rudy Giuliani who came to Dole of his own accord much later) behind one of the most inept GOP presidential candidates ever.  D'Amato will attempt to blame the Dole loss on extremists in his party (some of D'Amato's local hacks started spinning this thesis on election night).  However, in reality, it was largely GOP liberals and moderates like D'Amato who pushed Bob Dole to the forefront.
<P>     
We wonder: Isn't there anybody in the whole New York GOP who will stand up and primary Al D'Amato -- some former Ambassador, some retired executive?  Is there no bond trader or investment banker in the state who refuses to kiss D'Amato's you-know-what?  Somebody who can't be bought with a patronage job, or who cares more about policy and economic freedom than pork.  Of course, there are some, but alas D'Amato controls the GOP patronage machine -- at least until 1998.  Post-1998 is when things might get interesting for New York Republicans.

<h2>
Carolan & Keating -- November 4, 1996<br>
Who Was Eugene Travis?<br>
</h2>
<p>
<h3>
by Matthew Carolan and Raymond J. Keating<br>
</h3>
</center>
<blockquote>
<p>In a democracy, ideas and choices matter.  Under the best of circumstances, rival political parties offer the electorate real alternatives in terms of governing philosophies.  Indeed, a country or state's well-being depends not only on rigorous economic competition in the free marketplace, but healthy competition in the political market as well.
<p>When the line between political competitors begins to blur, the consequences can be severe.  For example, from the end of World War II until the late 1970s, Great Britain fell into this deadly trap.  Both the Labour Party and the Tories worshiped the false idol of democratic socialism.  As a result, Britain's economy and position on the world stage suffered dearly.  Neither political party offered an alternative until Margaret Thatcher became prime minister.  
<p>New York has suffered a similar fate in the twentieth century.  Supposedly, Republicans are the party of private enterprise, free markets, and traditional social values, while Democrats offer government action and liberal views on social issues.  Unfortunately, the line between Democrat and Republican in the Empire State often blurs.  
<p>Three current examples stand out.  First, Republican New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who was elected with Liberal Party support, has shown little indication that he understands that high city taxes and regulations have all but extinguished the city's entrepreneurial spirit.  Giuliani's unwillingness to seriously cut taxes and government shows him to be more Democrat than Republican.  Second, bipartisan support among the state's elected officials for the environmental bond act on Tuesday's ballot clearly illustrated a blurring of the lines between the parties when it comes to pork spending -- which is what the bond act was primarily about -- and the environment.  And third, with the New York Republican Party now officially a pro-abortion party, the GOP can no longer be presumed as the party of traditional values, nor a party that protects life and liberty.
<p>However, blurred lines between parties is not new to New York.  Indeed, the most prominent example was Republican Governor Nelson Rockefeller, who out-taxed and out-spent every other governor in our nation's history.  Running a close second was one-time Republican Mayor of New York City John Lindsay, the biggest tax-and-spend mayor in U.S. history.  Further back, one sees another New York City mayor, Fiorello LaGuardia, the so-called fusion candidate.
<p>However, one of the earliest cases where New York's two parties lost distinction was in 1919, with New York's economy suffering heavy consequences to this day.  After the elections of 1918, Republicans controlled both state houses and Democrat Al Smith was the new governor.  Republican Eugene Travis served as state comptroller.
<p>With wartime prohibition coming into effect and the Prohibition amendment to the U.S. Constitution soon following, state officials were concerned over the loss of state and local revenues from liquor sales.  An inter-party deal was cut to impose a state income tax on individuals, allowing each party to avoid full blame.  With Republicans in control of both houses of the legislature, however, the income tax could have and should have been a dead issue.  
<p>Prominent opposition came from State Comptroller Travis.  Travis deemed the tax unnecessary.  For this simple act, Travis should be considered a Republican hero in New York.  He ignored an ugly deal other members of his party were willing to make at the time, and instead stood for principle, as well as fiscal and economic soundness.  
<p>Travis stood up against the most destructive and intrusive tax known to man -- the income tax.  The income tax has raised the costs of working, investing and risk taking -- the sources of economic growth -- while serving as high-octane fuel for the growth of government.
<p>Most political blurring in New York has been cases where Republicans give up on their limited-government principles in favor of traditional Democrat governmental activism.  The only prominent case of blurring in the opposite direction was when Democrat Governor Hugh Carey supported the elimination of the state's unincorporated business tax, a rather Republican thing to do.  The tax was phased out in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and entrepreneurship received a little boost in New York.  
<p>Recent Republican nibbling at the edges of big government and high taxes will not be enough to make New York an economic powerhouse once again.  If the GOP is to be a source of the Empire State's re-birth, they will have to advance bold measures.  
<p>Republicans should pick up the cause of Eugene Travis.  The income tax wasn't needed in 1919, and it surely will only hamper New York in the twenty-first century, with both capital and labor more easily avoiding onerous taxes.  Proposing an end to the anti-work, anti-investment, anti-risk-taking income tax would ignite entrepreneurship, economic growth, and job creation in New York for the first time in decades.  It also would be a major step toward New York Republicans becoming true Republican once again.

<h2>
Carolan & Keating -- October 28, 1996<br>
Pre-Election Round-Up<br>
</h2>
<p>
<h3>
by Matthew Carolan and Raymond J. Keating<br>
</h3>
</center>
<p>
<blockquote>
<dd>A few observations before the November 5 election:
<ul>
<li>C&K's most interesting New York races to watch:<ol><li>Top notch Republican, Conservative, and Right-to-Life candidate Sue Wittig in New York's 26th CD has a real shot to topple nationally known green Democrat Maurice Hinchey; <li>Democratic Party honcho Judith Hope pins party hopes on Carolyn McCarthy -- whose husband was killed, and son shot in LIRR massacre -- in her race against Republican Dan Frisa in Long Island's 4th CD. McCarthy, a nice woman, knows nothing about the issues, including assault weapons ban she touts.  Big sympathy vote gives her the lead, though final Frisa mail blitz to undecideds could pull out the race in a conservative district.</ol>
<li>Missing: Governor of New York.  Governor Pataki has been seen promoting environmental pork bond act, catching a flight to Central Europe, and at Yankee Stadium.  However, the Dole for President campaign can't seem to find him.  Indeed, New York Republican lemmings must regret having followed their leader Senator D'Amato over the Dole cliff.
<li>It's a shame that Bob Dole and Jack Kemp have run an unbelievably inept presidential campaign and will lose on November 5.  The Dole-Kemp economic plan would have provided much-needed tax and regulatory relief for New York taxpayers, entrepreneurs and businesses.  The Dole-Kemp 15 percent across-the-board income tax reduction and the $500 per child tax credit would have saved New York families an estimated $1,646 per year on average.  The 50 percent cut in the capital gains tax, along with inflation indexing, would have provided a significant boost to investment, risk taking and economic growth.  Throw in some real regulatory and legal reform, and this Dole-Kemp plan makes the Pataki tax cuts look puny.  But New York will help send Clinton back to the White House, with real tax and regulatory reform put off until the next century.
<li>Throughout his career, Jack Kemp has enthusiastically reached out to black Americans and other minorities with a market-oriented agenda, while many others in his party neglected the minority vote.  We applaud Kemp's efforts. However, during recent weeks of this presidential contest, when Dole-Kemp can't even shore up the traditional GOP base, one has to wonder why Kemp still spends so much time in places like Harlem.  The numbers -- e.g., one percentage point of the black vote translates into roughly 0.1 percentage point of the total vote -- make it difficult to justify Kemp's regular campaigning in these final days in inner cities.  
<li>As is increasingly the case, New York Conservative Party turns out to be a mixed bag this year.  "Contract with New York" turns out to be a non-starter, as anti-Gingrich sentiment stifles talk of programmatic reform. However, Conservative Party legislative ratings for this year do show a decided shift to the right under Pataki, with even liberals like Sheldon Silver voting 50 percent conservative.  Perhaps lack of wedge issues produced grade inflation? Meanwhile, Tom Long, brother of Conservative Party Chairman Mike Long, gives Queens County Conservative Party endorsement in New York's 7th CD to fanatical pro-choice Republican Rose Birtley, running against pro-life Democrat Tom Manton by touting her support of partial-birth abortion.  Would Queens conservatives endorse similar extremists if they supported a progressive income tax or cutting patronage jobs for conservative lackeys?  Perhaps we don't want to know the answer to that question. Kudos, however, to Westchester conservatives for giving line to Joe DioGuardi, and not incumbent liberal GOPer Sue Kelly in 19th CD.  Kelly, for some undisclosed reason, warrants the undying, arm-twisting support of Speaker Newt Gingrich.
<li>Memo to Long Island Congressman Peter King: Gerry Adams called. He wants to congratulate you for taking on Louis Farrakhan so courageously in your campaign literature.
<li>For once, C&K agrees with the New York Democratic Party.  They recently asserted that Senator D'Amato's ads for the environmental pork bond act essentially amount to political shilling to re-build Senator Pothole's reputation.
<li>Ron Lauder seems to be suffering from a split personality.  On the one hand, he fights the good fight to keep New York City's term limits in tact.  On the other hand, according to The New York Times, Lauder forked over $25,000 to support the environmental pork bond act.
<li>After hockey's Devils won a Stanley Cup, they got a new arena deal from New Jersey officials.  Likewise, the Yankees' World Series victory will seal the deal for a new $1 billion-plus, taxpayer-financed Yankee Stadium.
<li>Conservative opposition to the environmental pork bond act has not exactly been robust.  Of course, New York's unprincipled business groups largely support this $1.75 billion boost in New York debt.  Some supporters even claim that the bond act will create tens of thousands of jobs!  Will New York political and community leaders ever understand that only a robust private sector creates wealth and jobs?  We doubt it.

The Myth of the Common Man

<DD><FONT SIZE=+2>C</FONT>ruising the World Wide Web the other day, we came across the New York Democratic Party site.  Like most Web sites, it's a high-tech mix of text and graphics. But when you read it closely, you get a decidedly "retro" feeling. So retro in fact, it seems like the Democrats want you to forget the last 170 years ever happened.
<P>
     The Democratic Party, we are told, traces its origins back to two legendary American political figures: Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson.  Jefferson was an "anti-Federalist," who wanted to keep power out of the hands of an aristocratic elite that gained
special favors from government -- a kind of politics that caused chaos in Europe. Despite Jefferson's distrust of the uneducated masses, it is said, he was a theoretician of limited-government who paved the way for mass democracy.
<P>     
But with the election of Andrew Jackson to the presidency in 1828, the common man came out of the political wilderness.  The Jacksonians, who distrusted bankers and reflected the Western pioneer spirit, defeated powerful aristocratic forces in the Senate to take the presidency. Jackson welcomed the average person to participate in the affairs of his country.  Shortly following his term, the U.S. witnessed a seven-fold increase in votes cast in a presidential election.  Today, the two heroes are celebrated by the Democrats at their annual Jefferson-Jackson Day dinners. 
<P>     
Of course, when you look at today's New York State Republicans -- who seem about as close to an arrogant, self-serving European elite as you can get -- you can understand why Democratic passions for the common man are still inflamed.  But as far as we can tell, the Republicans at least spare us hypocritical history lessons.
<P>     
The Democratic myth of the "common man" has brought about exactly what Jefferson decried: saviors in government.  During the New Deal, the common man was told that an intrusive central government, run by the Democrats, would tell him what his interests and who his enemies were, and would tax and regulate him at unprecedented rates for his own good.  After the 1968 Democratic convention, the common man would become known by his better name, "member of the victim group," who needed the political class to gain redress for his discontents.
<P>     
New York's Democratic Party identifies the good of society with the good of certain segments of New York, like the teachers' unions, public employees unions, ethnic militants, and trial lawyers, among others.  But how, for example, does it advance the interests of the average family to drive up the cost of living through excessive taxation on income, food, fuel, and property, to support a burgeoning public sector?  How does it serve the interests of the common man to make him pay twice to give his child a religious education, or to be unable to fire lousy public school teachers?  How does it help the common man to pay excessive insurance rates because the Democrats protect trial lawyers who make fat commissions off excessive judgements?  To us it sounds an awful like the chaotic European politics Jefferson rejected.
<P>     
The problem of course is that America, and most assuredly New York, have abandoned Jefferson's most important notion: limited government.  Such a government makes no pretense to solve all man's problems, and does not manipulate groups of people in feats of social engineering.
<P>     
Indeed, in the eyes of Alexis de Tocqueville, when he came to observe the new experiment in democracy and chronicle it in Democracy in America, one of the saving graces of our nation was its absence of group or class envy.  The common man of de Tocqueville's day had no enemies for his government or his party to demonize. 
<P>     
We wonder if the same is true today.  Visit the Clinton/Gore '96 Web site, and you don't get that impression.  There, if you like, you can get updates on what the party will do for every victim group.  You can also download bumper stickers to support the common-man's President, who feels everybody's pain and protects the now-failing middle-class entitlements from demon Republicans.  There is a bumper sticker in Spanish, another with a pink triangle on it, and one for women.  But there was no bumper sticker that every one can use, one for "the common man" and his values.  Maybe that's because the common man doesn't put much value, or faith, in government.

Carolan & Keating -- October 14, 1996<br>
The Dying "Culture of Death"
<br>
</h2>
<p>
<h3>
by Matthew Carolan and Raymond J. Keating<br>
</h3>
</center>
<p>
<blockquote>

<p>It's ironic how destiny works.  Amidst all the hoopla in Albany over George Pataki's rather meager accomplishments, along with a dreary presidential campaign, a relatively unknown Attorney General by the name of Dennis Vacco quietly prepares to argue a case before the Supreme Court that will shake the republic, and make his a household name.
<p>The case is Quill v. Vacco, which the High Court has agreed to review after a Federal court struck down New York State's law against assisted suicide.  A decision will come early Summer.  No matter the outcome however, the case will mark the end of the culture of death.
<p>In the July 21 New York Times Sunday Magazine, the nation's foremost anti-euthanasia expert, Professor Yale Kamisar, expressed concerns that assisted suicide be seen as a privacy issue akin to that found in Roe v. Wade, which he supports.  Kamisar now wants limits on what one does with one's own body: "When the Court ruled in 1973, it termed abortion unique," the professor notes. "It never said the right of privacy should be extended this far."
<p>The Times reports that many pro-choicers are joining pro- lifers in a new anti-assisted-suicide coalition.  They argue that "pulling the plug," allowing someone to die from their own natural ailments, is not the same as intentionally killing them through lethal injection -- even if it is a "private" matter between a person and her doctor.
<p>We agree.  Who or what is the "cause of death" makes all the moral difference.  But Kamisar and friends are a little late.  When Dennis Vacco goes before the Supreme Court, he will be fighting seventy years of liberal jurisprudence -- which has deemed nearly every question of life and sexuality to be "religious" and therefore unconstitutional bases for the law.
<p>For example, in Hawaii, "marriage" is about to be redefined. Once linked to notions of heterosexuality, fidelity, and offspring, marriage is now an empty concept, to be defined according to one's constitutionally protected "liberty."  So too for "life," which the Casey decision says is another empty concept.  Mothers may define the "meaning" of the life of their child any way that want, and act accordingly.
<p>Now the new utopians say, "Why should we be bound by what Hippocrates said, when referring to both suicide and abortion he said: 'Doctors may not kill.'?"
<p>The chickens of privacy then have come home to roost.  Under the mantle of privacy, Americans have the right to be despairing lunkheads; to be shortsighted; to live life in terms of a false dilemma, and have doctors help them.  On abortion: "It's either my life, or this baby's, there is no other way."  On suicide: "Either I live in terrible pain, or somebody kills me (death with dignity), there is no other way."
<p>We do not agree with either murderous notion. As Hippocrates argued, there is always a middle way, and the doctor must find it.  Despite being armed with only a pestle and some herbs to ease pain, Hippocrates' had the more progressive vision, because he built medicine on metaphysics, which we have rejected.  He saw that doctors, as humans, not Gods, do not have the competence to determine the value of any life, but only to serve that life with pain relief, or healing.  It's ironic that with all our advanced skills for pain relief we demand the easier way.
<p>You can be sure however that our worried liberals will not invoke God before the Court, having already granted the humans god- like powers in Roe v. Wade and Casey.  They can only turn to their own self-interest, which may not be enough to stop the death march of liberty.  In the Netherlands, where assisted suicide is legal, doctors regularly kill people without their consent, because the law allows the doctor God-like judgement that some lives are objectively not worth living.
<p>If the Court strikes down state laws against assisted suicide, we expect a constitutional crisis undermining the judicially imposed culture of death.  Some governors are thought courageous enough to oppose the Court, like George Allen of Virginia, or Kirk Fordice of Mississippi.
<p>But even if the Court denies a broad right to assisted suicide, it is still a victory against the entire culture of death. For the Court would be implicitly accepting that medical tradition can have an objective nature against killing, against despair.  And from this small seed, new insights may grow.
<p>As psychiatrist Herbert Hendin told the Times about the desire for suicide, it is a "cry for help," and with proper care, the depression goes away.  Pain relief is always possible for the suicidal.  Then isn't the same relief, a fortiori, always possible for the depressed pregnant woman?
<p>Pray then, for Dennis Vacco. His job is nothing less than reversing the course of the established civil religion.

Carolan & Keating -- September 30, 1996
<br>
Higher Education in New York
<br>
</h2>
<p>
<h3>
by Matthew Carolan and Raymond J. Keating<br>
</h3>
</center>
<p>
<blockquote>
Since the days of ancient Greece, the process of education has been about finding the "reality" beneath the appearances.  As today's parents wonder about higher education for their children, they should know New York's vaunted college market is not as it appears.
<p>For example, take some course offerings at New York's "finest" educational institutions, as surveyed by the Young America's Foundation.  At Columbia, students can opt for "English W3500y: Topics in Gay Male Representation," or "Spanish and Portuguese BC3135y: Reading for Difference: Lesbian and Gay Themes."  At Cornell there's "Housing and Feeding the Homeless," or "Lesbian Personae," "Gay Fiction," or "Introduction to Sexual Minorities."  At New York University, there's "Race, Class, Gender, and Ethnicity in the City: The Politics of Urban Society," and "Sexual Diversity in Society."  
<p>Thinking of sending your daughter of Vassar?  Get ready for "From Bohemia to Queer: Contemporary Lesbian and Gay Communities in America," or "The Politics of Difference," which "explicitly explores," according to the catalog, "issues of race, class, gender and sexual orientation."
<p>These once-elite schools now reflect all the rot that has crept into "post-modern" education. The traditional core curriculum, which emphasized logical skill and general historical knowledge, has been dismantled in favor of the narrow, ideologically driven study of "socially constructed identity," and "victims of oppression." 
<p>An interesting lesson in how to respond to this nonsense comes from one of the classic texts of conservatism, God and Man at Yale by William F. Buckley, Jr.  The book caused a firestorm among Yale alumni some four decades ago with its dramatic charge that Yale had abandoned the traditional religious ideals of its Protestant founders.  And the book's success proved that no matter how much bleating there is about "academic freedom," academics teach at the grace of the alumni who keep the school and its particular traditions afloat.  If you violated those traditions, as was done at Yale, you lost funding.
<p>That's why we advise any donor to a school to do more than read the propaganda newsletter mailed out by your alma mater.  Read the course catalog, talk to fellow alumni, and ask the students how many classes are being taught about lesbians with a VCR instead of Dante and Shakespeare with a primary text.
<p>Of course, radical academics are not standing still.  They have been doing their level best to eliminate alumni control, by dramatically increasing the federal and state role in education. Now the government can demand diversity, civil rights, and affirmative action for "victim groups" in the schools.  And taxpayers already living paycheck to paycheck, with government laying claim to 40 percent of their income, have little time or incentive to root out university crackpots, though rich alumni might.
<p>Look at the slide in the State University of New York (SUNY) schools.  A shocking study by the Empire Foundation and the National Association of Scholars details just how far afield the multicultural fad has taken taxpayer-funded education in New York.  Using SUNY's own data, it was found that at the 16 major SUNY campuses studied, only half required students to take course work in Western Civilization, but all mandated the study of gender, sexuality, afrocentrism, etc.
<p>It was also found that at all the schools, students can entirely avoid taking quite a few of the eight traditional core courses.  At SUNY-Binghamton, for example, students are required to take gym, but not English composition, math, literature, or philosophy.  And at Freedonia, students can get through four years of college and never have to take any classes in history, literature, philosophy, foreign languages, arts, or science.  Kind of reminds us of the Freedonia run by Groucho Marx.
<p>And even where core requirements exist, students can satisfy the requirement with esoteric multicultural courses like "Saints, Witches, and Madwomen" (New Paltz's Writing requirement), or "Horror Literature" (Old Westbury, Writing and Reasoning Skills), or "Literature of Sports" (Cortland, Literature), instead of more rigorous general knowledge courses.
<p>What has been the response of the SUNY educrats to these criticisms, and others about alarming drop-out rates and declining SAT standards for entering SUNY student?  "The Empire Foundation is run by rich guys who hate taxes and don't like public education."  Those benefitting from a classical education recognize the logical fallacy known as the ad hominem circumstantial: dismissing your opponent because of his background instead of answering the argument.
<p>We'll admit our bias.  We think government-funded higher education is inherently wasteful, and destroys educational performance in favor of narrow political goals.  Of course, the trustees of SUNY, and the Faculty Senate (who are meeting this week), could prove us wrong.  They can change SUNY's course from left-wing indoctrination to a truly liberal education.  But until they do, we'll continue to consider ourselves the victims of their oppression.

Carolan & Keating -- September 16, 1996<BR>
Any Real Conservatives in New York?<BR>
</h2>
<P>
<h3>
by Matthew Carolan and Raymond J. Keating<BR>
</h3>
</center>
<P>
<blockquote>
In recent years, a few skirmishes seem to have broken out on the
conservative side of the political aisle.  Many in the media,
of course, have portrayed this as an epic war on the right between
social conservatives and economic conservatives.
<P>
Like most true conservatives, we fail to see what all the fuss
is about.  We're both economically and socially conservative &#173;&#173;
supply&#173;side, pro&#173;family, free&#173;trade, pro&#173;life,
hawkish, internationalist, property&#173;rights, small&#173;government
conservatives.
<P>
The controversy arises when self&#173;proclaimed &quot;conservative&quot;
politicians turn out, in reality, to be moderates or fence&#173;sitters.
 New York and the rest of the Northeast are full of such impersonators.
 Indeed, Governors Bill Weld (Massachusetts), Christie Whitman
(New Jersey), John Rowland (Connecticut), and New York's own George
Pataki, all claim to be conservatives.  However, their records
and positions show each to be mild economic and fiscal conservatives,
while being quite liberal on many social issues, most prominently
on abortion.
<P>
On the flip side, Pat Buchanan claims the mantle of conservatism
as well.  But in reality, Buchanan turns out only to be conservative
on social issues, while on the economics front he has become a
raving class warrior, touting the liberal, big&#173;labor line
on issues like trade and immigration.
<P>
This division between Buchananites and middle&#173;of&#173;the&#173;road
Republicans turns out not really to be a battle on the right at
all, but a fight between two very confused camps within the Republican
Party.  One side fails to understand the value of human life while
the other misunderstands the value of free, unfettered markets.
 Neither are conservative in a complete sense.
<P>
To get a sense of how truly conservative the New York congressional
delegation is, C&amp;K turned to two sources.  The Christian Coalition,
a pro&#173;family group with more than 1.7 million members, rated
the 104th Congress according to 13 key votes in the House of Representatives
and 11 key votes in the Senate.  These votes offer a good representation
of socially conservative issues, from abortion to welfare reform
to school vouchers to tax cuts.  The Small Business Survival Committee
(SBSC), a pro&#173;entrepreneur, pro&#173;free market advocacy
group with more than 40,000 small business members (C&amp;K's
Keating serves as chief economist for SBSC), rated Congress according
to 25 key votes in the House and 18 key votes in the Senate. 
The issues ranged from deregulation to private property rights
to spending reductions to tax cuts &#173;&#173; a good representation
of conservative economic issues.  
<P>
Indeed, as any good conservative would expect, the two organizations
had some overlap in terms of the issues on which Members of Congress
were rated.  Each group used a scoring system whereby 100 rated
best and 0 rated worst.  In the accompanying chart, C&amp;K combined
the two scores to arrive at a gauge for the complete conservative,
and ranked New York's congressional delegation accordingly.  A
perfect score is 200.
<P>
Not to our surprise, no New York Member of Congress scored a perfect
200, though three House Members impressively scored in the 190s.
 These three &#173;&#173; Solomon, Frisa, and Paxon &#173;&#173;
are all Republicans.  Gilman, Houghton, and worst of all, Boelhert
rated least conservative among New York GOPers in the House.
<P>
No Democrats scored well.  The least liberal, you might say, was
McNulty in the House, followed by LaFalce and Manton.  Ackerman,
Hinchey, and Serrano scored perfectly liberal zeros.
<P>
As for the Senate, Al D'Amato scored slightly favorable on the
conservative meter, and Pat Moynihan miserably.
<P>
Obviously, these ratings are not comprehensive, in that they reflect
only select key votes.  But they do give the reader a feeling
of where their elected officials generally come down  &#173;&#173;
left or right &#173;&#173; on the issues.
<P>
Overall, New York's congressional delegation rates very liberal.
 Indeed, in our view, the Empire State can claim only one or two
across&#173;the&#173;board principled conservatives in Congress.
 Meanwhile, little more can be said at the state level, with a
handful of principled conservatives in the Assembly and none to
be found among state senators, the Governor or the Lieutenant
Governor.
<P>
Of course, this dearth of true conservatism explains why New York
ranks among the worst in the nation in areas like taxes, government
spending, entrepreneurship, job creation, and abortions.<BR>

<h2>
Carolan & Keating -- September 9, 1996<BR>
Power to the People?<BR>
</h2>
<P>
<h3>
by Matthew Carolan &amp; Raymond J. Keating<BR>
</h3>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>
     Remember the energy crisis of the 1970s: gas rationing, lines
at the pump, inflation?  Well, there was a silver lining, which
might now pay off big for New Yorkers.
<P>
      When experts predicted oil at $100 per barrel back then,
the power industry &#173;&#173; long a government&#173;protected
monopoly &#173;&#173; was forced to innovate. The 1978 National
Energy Act mandated that local utilities buy power from &quot;QFs&quot;
or qualifying facilities (wind power, solar power, etc.).  When
oil prices stabilized, QFs became boondoggles.  But at the same
time, they stirred a revolution called &quot;wheeling.&quot; 
Wheeling moves electricity long distances over transmission wires
and allows utilities to buy cheap surplus power from each other.
<P>
     Washington is about to repeal many arcane regulations in
wheeling and power production, creating an exciting, fluid market.
 Power producers will now be able to reconfigure and recapitalize
like other businesses, and sell across the country or around the
world.
<P>
     More importantly, they will be able to compete to sell to
individual homeowners (retail wheeling), just like in local and
long distance phone service.  Experts predict lower prices, which
will ripple throughout the economy.  Under federal waivers some
projects have already started.  Last April, New Hampshire began
wheeling for 17,000 customers.
<P>
     The state Public Service Commission (PSC), which governs
New York's utilities, has long called for retail wheeling.  An
admirable position, since not often do government regulators give
up jobs. But we fear their goal of retail power here by 1998 could
be derailed.
<P>
     As power producers and government disentangle, many inefficient
facilities, no longer protected by regulation, will have their
real value exposed by the market.  Naturally investors will look
for a bailout.  Many of the PSC's governing &quot;principles&quot;
for a retail market &#173;&#173; i.e. &quot;fair trade,&quot;
&quot;environmental protection,&quot; etc. &#173;&#173; provide
lots of wiggle room for these special interests to stick costs
on ratepayers.  Recent battles in Washington over telecommunications
deregulation went that way.
<P>
     What concerns us also is the role of New York's government&#173;created
power &quot;authorities,&quot; like the New York Power Authority
(NYPA), and the Long Island Power Authority (LIPA).
<P>
     NYPA was created in 1931, originally on the St. Lawrence
River to provide power to the Massena area. Like most government
bureaucracies it has regularly expanded its mission.  NYPA suggests
it is &quot;uniquely positioned&quot; to handle &quot;all&quot;
power transmission in the new retail market.  Some are suggesting
NYPA buy up transmission grids and independent power producers.
<P>
     LIPA was created in 1986 to respond to the reversal of fortune
of the Shoreham nuclear power plant.  After the Three Mile Island
accidents, attitudes toward Shoreham changed and LILCO investors
were left with a $4 billion liability.  A deal was made for LIPA
to dismantle the plant for $1, while the PSC still haggles with
LILCO over recovering its losses, a prime obstacle to recapitalizing
the utility.  The government solution is to have LIPA issue municipal
bonds to buy LILCO, thus eliminating federal taxes on it, thus
reducing electric rates for Long Islanders.  The Governor tells
us LIPA will eventually sell off parts of LILCO but run transmission.
<P>
     We wonder why, however, in the coming fluid market, government
authorities need to be involved at all.  There are, of course,
political reasons, such as relationships with bond traders and
grateful investors who contribute to political campaigns.  There
are the votes of myopic rate&#173;payers, clamoring for immediate
relief.  What's more, New York's authorities offer excellent opportunities
for patronage. Many a former free&#173;market conservative has
found a lucrative, out&#173;of&#173;the&#173;way home there.
<P>
     But why should LIPA buy generators, which might be worth
nothing in a market full of new generators?  Consumers will get
stuck with the cost.  (Or, a more efficiently capitalized LILCO
could also recover in the new world market.)
<P>
     Why should NYPA and LIPA lock up all the transmission business
in New York?  Recapitalized utilities can run transmission lines
themselves, and other entities with rights&#173;of&#173;way, like
railroads, subways, and phone companies, can stop monopolies by
offering transmission in a dynamic market.
<P>
     Clyde Crews of the Competitive Enterprise Institute warns:
&quot;The worst thing you can have is a government&#173;controlled
monopoly on transmission.&quot;  Even a private monopoly would
be better, he notes, since an unprotected monopoly would more
easily spur competing building of extra transmission facilities,
or even innovative production to circumvent the monopoly, (such
as microturbines for home use).
<P>
     The state PSC has so far kept NYPA at arms' length, offering
only vague statements that NYPA may have &quot;some role.&quot;
 They should have no role.  LIPA too should be dismantled.  LILCO
investors are victims of regulatory fickleness by government,
but that's their problem.  There is no need to lock ratepayers
into dangerous long&#173;term government deals, when so much potential
savings exists in the emerging market.
<P>
     These are the political obstacles.  We just hope the PSC
gets tough with special interests.

Carolan & Keating -- September 2, 1996<BR>
Term Limits: City and State<BR>
</h2>
<P>
<h3>
by Matthew Carolan and Raymond J. Keating<BR>
</h3>
<P>
</center>
<blockquote>
     You know liberalism is in trouble when even New York City
Council members, some of the state's most hard&#173;left politicos,
are aping Bill Clinton by cloaking themselves in the mantle of
conservatism.  Just look at their current attempt to protect their
jobs with their &quot;responsible&quot; version of term limits
this fall.
<P>
     Recall that in 1993, New Yorkers voted 60 percent to 40 percent
to impose limits on their Council members of two terms of four
years each.  Now the Council is trying to weasel out from under
the law, offering a referendum to change the limits from eight
years to 12, and to &quot;restart the clock&quot; on their careers
so that many of them won't have to leave until 2007.  Council
Speaker and perpetual politician Peter Vallone argues that without
these changes there will be &quot;absolute chaos,&quot; as &quot;inexperienced&quot;
politicians take over the whole Council at once.
<P>
     Anyone who follows the City Council knows what its &quot;experience&quot;
is like. This past year the New York Post offered a shocking expose
of Council members' poor attendance records, uncouth manner, and
lack of initiative.  Priscilla Wooten, Democrat from Brooklyn,
recently summarized her 14&#173;year career in one line: &quot;I
just know how to play the game.&quot;
<P>
     A cadre of unelected special interests &#173;&#173; labor
unions, ethnic militants, real estate developers, and party bosses
&#173;&#173; help keep the same old hacks in power, bleeding the
city and state.  Much fault lies also with New Yorkers, who either
benefit from Council greed or don't turn out to vote.  Yet, even
the most principled voter can't undo this mess if given only a
&quot;choice&quot; of candidates dominated by those interests.
<P>
     Term limits takes the &quot;career&quot; out of politics,
offering a government based on ideas rather than personal friendships
and payoffs.  Term limits have been recommended by Thomas Jefferson,
John Adams, Ben Franklin, Abraham Lincoln, Harry Truman, and Dwight
Eisenhower.  Studies by the CATO Institute show a direct correlation
between length in office and increased pork&#173;barrel spending.
<P>
     According to U.S. Term Limits, 21 states, mostly out West
where big government is less in vogue, have instituted term limits
for their state legislators.  Over 3,000 localities across the
U.S. now have limits, with 26 localities in New York State (10
passing limits in 1993 alone).  And in major cities like New Orleans
and Kansas City, as Ronald Lauder points out, term limits have
not produced any negative consequences.
<P>
     Expect the battle in New York City to get personal.  Desperate
politicians are sure to try to muddy the waters, accusing millionaire
Lauder &#173;&#173; a prime mover behind New York's term limits
movement &#173;&#173; of what they themselves are guilty of: &quot;allowing
money to influence the political process.&quot;   Allen Roth,
a spokesman for Mr. Lauder, notes: &quot;As long as the voters
know that they now have the term limits they want, they won't
accept the Council's arguments.&quot;
<P>
     Internal polls for the term limits movement show opposition
to the Council's changes stands at 70 percent.  The most recent
New York Post poll shows support for the current limits at 63
percent to 18 percent.     And informed sources also tell us that
a surprising number of influential liberals are soon to denounce
the Council's term&#173;limits revision.  Mr. Lauder is going
to spend &quot;whatever it takes&quot; to defeat the new initiative.
 Even the New York Times, which does not support term limits,
has accused Vallone of trying to do an &quot;end run&quot; around
the will of the voters.  Expect a major defeat for the Council
this fall.
<P>
     Can conservatives parlay the scalping of Mr. Vallone into
something more?  The Conservative Party's &quot;Contract with
New York&quot; calls for term limits as part of the overall strategy
to win the statehouse this year.  And a poll conducted recently
by Fabrizio&#173; McLaughlin and Associates shows that voters
are more likely, by a margin of 72 percent to 10 percent, to support
a candidate who pledges to limit his own term.  Seems like a golden
opportunity for the New York GOP, which has been trying to win
the Assembly for years. 
<P>
     We're not so sure, however, that the current Republican leadership
are at all interested.  (After all, New York Republicans seems
as enthralled with doling out billions in pork dollars each year
as Democrats are.)  And under current law, no referendum to amend
the state constitution can go to the voters before the politicians
in Albany deign to support it on two separate legislative sessions.
 That's unlikely.
<P>
     Conservative activists need to put the heat on Governor Pataki,
who allegedly supports term limits.  If Pataki fails to make the
case for a term limits referendum &#173;&#173; a golden opportunity
for Assembly candidates this fall &#173;&#173; he would clearly
line up on the side of pork over principle.  A sufficient reason,
we think, for the Conservative Party leaders (who despise pork)
to run their own gubernatorial candidate in 1998.

Carolan & Keating -- August 26, 1996<BR>
The Costs of Public Universities in New York<BR>
</h2>
<P>
<h3>
by Matthew Carolan and Raymond J. Keating<BR>
</h3>
</center>
<P>
As collegians head back to campuses across New York and the rest
of the nation, our thoughts turn to the state and cost of higher
education today.  In particular, the taxpayer costs for the Empire
State's public universities are much steeper than most New Yorkers
seem to realize.
<P>
Make no mistake, both public and private institutions of higher
learning suffer problems.  The college professor, as one observer
has wryly noted, stands as the only profession &#173;&#173; perhaps
barring prostitution &#173;&#173; where productivity has actually
dropped since the time of Socrates.  Tenure shields teachers from
the healthy pressures of the marketplace.  College and university
professors regularly argue for increased compensation and fewer
working hours through their unions.  And while we all need to
stay abreast of the latest developments in our respective fields,
few of us can imagine getting regular sabbaticals &#173;&#173;
only in academia. 
<P>
When a work load of one, two, or perhaps three courses a semester
becomes too burdensome, &quot;over&#173;worked&quot; professors
can turn teaching duties over to graduate students.  In which
case, parents wind up paying for their sons and daughters to attend
classes with student teachers standing at the front of the classroom.
 Too often, professors are off publishing, while quality teaching
perishes.  Indeed, the ivy covered walls of academia can hide
many woes.
<P>
Meanwhile at private institutions, tuition costs rise ever higher,
no matter what the economic climate it seems.  But at least in
the private marketplace, individuals make a choice based on price.
 I.e., selecting a college and paying the commensurate tuition
is not coercive in nature, it is a choice.  The same cannot be
said of public university systems like the State University of
New York (SUNY) and the City University of New York (CUNY).  Tuition
and fees come no where near covering the full cost of education
at SUNY or CUNY.  New York taxpayers foot the majority of the
bill.
<P>
Public university systems serve as glaring examples of good intentions
through government action gone predictably far awry, resulting
in bloated bureaucracies and skyrocketing costs.  Naturally, New
York offers the most bloated university system.  SUNY, created
in 1948, ranks as the largest state university system in the nation
with 64 campuses.  CUNY, whose forerunners were given birth in
the 1930s, ranks third biggest with 19 schools.  State taxpayers
assumed responsibilities for financing CUNY's senior colleges
and capital programs after New York City proved itself financially
inept during the fiscal crisis of the 1970s.
<P>
The per student (full&#173;time equivalent) total cost of running
SUNY equals about $22,700 annually.  CUNY tops the $23,000 per
student (full&#173;time equivalent) mark.  In the meantime, undergraduate
tuition at SUNY is about $3,400 and $3,200 at CUNY.
<P>
Compared with other states, the average salary for a full&#173;time
professor at a public university in New York ranked fourth highest
in the nation in 1994 at just under $75,000.  Mind you, this is
based on a nine&#173;month contract.  In addition, New York claims
the highest per capita cost for state undergraduate scholarship
and grant programs in the nation.  And on top of all these state
campuses and costs, localities run their own community colleges
across New York.
<P>
The time has arrived to dismantle this government education monstrosity.
 With thousands of private colleges and universities across the
nation, no need exists for government&#173;run institutions of
higher learning.  These public colleges and universities originally
were created out of fears that private colleges were either too
costly or discriminatory.  Well, today, the total costs &#173;&#173;
student and taxpayer combined &#173;&#173; for SUNY and CUNY outpace
costs at many of the nation's most elite private universities,
and discrimination pertaining to college admissions is nothing
but a fading memory.  If anything, affirmative action has fostered
reverse discrimination.
<P>
Some will argue that the tuition costs at private colleges and
universities still remain out of reach for many students.  If
true, then doesn't it make more sense to provide a means&#173;tested
voucher to students in actual need for private institutions, rather
than maintaining a huge, costly government bureaucracy?
<P>
Lastly, closing or privatizing two of the nation's largest public
university systems would offer another benefit.  Unproductive
professors would be booted off the taxpayer dole.  Who knows,
private colleges and universities may some day demand more of
their professors, handsomely compensating excellence and punishing
non&#173;performance.  If it ever happens, it will be at a private,
not a government, school.

<h2> Carolan & Keating  -- August 19, 1996<br>
The Welfare Oracle</h2>
<p>
<h3>by Matthew Carolan and Raymond J. Keating</h3>
</center>
<p>
<dd>Daniel Patrick Moynihan is a jolly fellow.  With PBS's Charlie Rose or on This Week with David Brinkley, the senior Senator from New York makes everybody laugh.  Only one thing gets Moynihan upset: when somebody else tries to reform welfare. <p>
<dd>     After all, Pat Moynihan is America's welfare oracle.  Having taken a courageous stand in the 1960s with writings explaining the damage social programs do to black families (Beyond the Melting Pot and The Negro Family: The Case for National Action), Moynihan has been living off his reputation ever since.  His own record on welfare reform is a disaster. <p>
<dd>     Moynihan was a part of the Nixon Administration's failed efforts at "family assistance" in 1969, and his attempts at welfare reform in 1988 did nothing to "end welfare as we know it." Moynihan has spent his career simply tinkering around the edges of big government, preserving for another day his role as "welfare scholar." <p>
<dd>     The current welfare reform law just passed, which has Moynihan in hysterics, is a modest effort, and a mixed bag.  It does end the most crucial fault of federal welfare policy: the guaranteed right to assistance, regardless of behavior.  It also allows time limits, which are long overdue. <p>
<dd>     However, these time limits are too lengthy, and rather than getting welfare out of the hands of the federal government entirely, the measure offers only minor flexibility for states.  Meanwhile, federal welfare spending continues its ascent, albeit at a slower rate, and the demand for workfare will do nothing but create more bureaucracy. <p>
<dd>     Senator Chicken Little calls these minor changes "the most brutal act of social policy since Reconstruction."  Later, more guardedly, he admits: "We don't know what's going to happen." <p>
<dd>     We know what's happened so far.  Since the 1960s taxpayers have sunk over $5.4 trillion dollars into welfare, with a horrifying rise in illegitimate births (now 70 percent among blacks and above 30 percent among whites) and octupled spending to show for it. Illegitimacy is the single greatest contributing factor to poverty. At least now the states will have some ability to make demands on recipients -- a necessary change.  Pat Moynihan, who hasn't had anything intelligent to say on welfare in 25 years, can try his "expertise" elsewhere. <p>
<dd> Hats off to State Senator John Marchi of Staten Island for showing political imagination on welfare while Rudy Giuliani and George Pataki just cry to the media about what federal reform will do to New York. <p>
<dd>     Writing in the August 12 New York Times, Marchi notes that under current judicial interpretation, Article XVII of the State Constitution, the one that guarantees assistance to the poor, has been construed to hold that nothing more than "need" can be considered in giving aid.  No other state in the union has such a policy, which helps to explain why New York spends almost twice the national average on welfare.  New York's Medicaid spending stands at more than Texas and California combined. Marchi wants to change the Amendment, giving the state more flexibility to restrict social programs on behavioral grounds. <p>
<dd>     Of course, guess who's standing in the way?  Democrat Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver knows the poverty industry serves as one of his key special-interest constituencies. He is blocking a possible amendment from going to the voters of New York State. <p>
<dd>     This is a golden opportunity for the Republicans in the fall elections.  If New-Democrat Bill Clinton can reform welfare by taking away blanket guarantees, New Yorkers certainly can as well.  Indeed, such a step becomes imperative if New York is to avoid being even more overwhelmed by welfare rejects from more frugal states. <p>
<dd> Get rid of welfare, it can't be "reinvented."  Peter Salins of Hunter College and the National Center for Policy Analysis in Texas have a better idea: private unemployment insurance.  With extra disposable income from lower taxes once welfare is gone, private citizens can buy cheaper, more efficient unemployment protection, which along with private charity will provide a better safety net. <p>
<dd>      Private policies tie costs to behaviors.  With government, where various poverty interest groups simply force others to pay, wise behavior is not necessary, and costs inevitably explode. The same thing occurs with government health insurance and other forms of "social security," as FDR called them.  Call it the anaesthetic society, where people numbed by government have no reason to stop biting their tongue. <p>
<dd> The charge that welfare reform "will throw millions of children onto the streets" raises a serious concern.  Welfare has become a kind of blackmail liberals want us to pay to irresponsible parents so they don't hurt innocent children.  Such blackmail is made easy if welfare can be had by simply filling out a form.  If the blackmailers had to look other people in the eye, and mend their ways, like they do at private charities, they would be less bold.  State-level government welfare, rather than federal, is a start, but the more local and more private the help, the more quickly these kinds of child abuse will disappear.<p>

VPs from New York: From Rockefeller to Kemp?</h2>
<p>
<h3>by Matthew Carolan and Raymond J. Keating</h3>
</center>
<dd>The last New York Republican to serve as Vice President of the United States was Nelson Rockefeller under President Gerald Ford.  However, the former New York Governor was Republican in name only.  Today, the name "Rockefeller" is anathema to all but the few most liberal members of the GOP, as Rockefeller earned infamy as the biggest tax-and-spend Governor in our nation's history. <p>
<dd>During the GOP's darkest hour -- Watergate -- Ford chose Nelson Rockefeller as his VP.  The selection proved so unpopular that Rockefeller was forced to withdraw from seeking the number two spot on the 1976 campaign ticket, which eventually went to Bob Dole.<p>
<dd>Now twenty years later, Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole has turned to New York for his own running mate.  To a New Yorker, though, with a decidedly different political philosophy than many other New York GOPers: former Buffalo Bills quarterback, New York Congressman (for 18 years from the Buffalo area), and HUD Secretary Jack Kemp.  With the combination of his plan to cut taxes and the Kemp pick, Dole has managed to energize his formerly moribund campaign. <p>
 	<dd>With almost any other New York Republican as his number two, we would have written off the Dole campaign.  In so many ways, however, Kemp has always been the antithesis of the standard New York Republican. <p>
<dd>Kemp believes in the power of ideas, while the New York GOP generally believes in watching polls.  Kemp emphasizes supply-side tax cuts (he was political father to the Reagan tax cuts), deregulation, and sound money as the keys to prosperity.  The New York GOP, particularly the state and national legislators, often prefer government pork barrel spending. <p>
<dd>Kemp is pro-choice when it comes to education, and pro-life on the abortion issue --contrary to many leading New York Republicans. <p>
<dd>Kemp also possesses a Reagan-esque vision about the economy, individuals, and the nation; in contrast to often dour New York Republicans.  Where Kemp poses a real alternative to politics as usual with his boundless optimism, many New York Republicans have tried to merely slow down what they seem to think is New York's inevitable decline. <p>
 Kemp's optimism is already paying dividends for the Dole campaign.  He fires up the GOP activists -- from supply-siders to pro-lifers -- and helps the ticket reach out to blue-collar Reagan Democrats -- lost by George Bush -- and creates inroads to minority communities. <p>
<dd>Kemp's only weaknesses from a conservative perspective are his somewhat favorable view of affirmative action and some evidence of squeamishness when it comes to deep cuts in government spending.  Dole generally remedies such woes, however. <p>
<dd>The prospect of Kemp as Vice President could change New York's political dynamic as well.  Kemp could help polish the long-tarnished reputation of the New York GOP on the national stage, perhaps even restoring New York's good name to the pre-Bull-Moose days of Teddy Roosevelt.  Also, New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani is now sure to endorse Dole-Kemp (Kemp endorsed Rudy in his bid for mayor).  And remember that Governor Pataki always has had very good things to say about Kemp as a presidential choice.  After all, Kemp helped boost Pataki's gubernatorial campaign in its final days by traveling the state with Pataki, focusing on tax cuts.  A new Giuliani-Kemp-Pataki connection would surely change the fortunes of the New York GOP nationally and within the state. <p>
<dd>Will Kemp swing New York in favor of Dole?  Surprisingly, New York State has gone Republican in five of the past eleven presidential campaigns, and in three of the last six.  If nothing else, Kemp's strengthening of the ticket will help tighten up the numbers in the Empire State, thus giving the GOP a better shot in New York state and federal legislative races.  But barring any new Clinton scandals, New York will likely stay with Clinton. <p>
<dd>Still C&K sees a Dole-Kemp Administration offering both promise and challenge to the New York GOP.  Lower personal income and capital gains taxes promised by Dole, added on to the Pataki tax cuts, will help boost New York's economy.  Dole's promise to return power to the states under the Tenth Amendment, as well as his plans to use the new presidential line item veto, something even Ronald Reagan didn't have, threaten to dismantle New York's poverty industry and sink the pork barrel. <p>
<dd>Questions naturally arise:  Are New York Republicans ready to rise to the challenge that Bob Dole and Jack Kemp pose, now and during a possible Kemp presidency beginning in 2000?  Is the New York GOP ready for a more mature governing philosophy of lower taxes, less spending, and less insider dealings?  Can they shake off Nelson Rockefeller for Jack Kemp? <p>
<dd>To some extent, Governor Pataki and the GOP New York State Assembly have begun this process.  The jury is still out on the Republican State Senate and the verdict looks bad for Mayor Giuliani, who reneged on a promise to let the city's personal income tax surcharge finally expire.  We'll see in the coming months.

<h2>Carolan & Keating - July 15, 1996<br>
Olympic Fever in New York
</h2>
<p>
<h3>by Matthew Carolan and Raymond J. Keating</h3>
</center>
<p>
<dd>Like most everyone else, C&K is looking forward to the summer Olympics getting underway this week in Atlanta.  From baseball to gymnastics, fencing to sailing, skeet shooting to equestrian events, we'll watch as much of the games as we can, wearing our sports nationalism proudly.  C&K has caught Olympic fever. <p>
<dd>Recent reports illustrate that New York politicians are not immune to this fever either.  In fact, some of them are so excited they're planning to try to lure the Olympics, once more, to New York.  Previously, the winter games came to Lake Placid in both 1932 and 1980. <p>
<dd>Lake Placid is at it again.  The village's mayor, T. James Strack, recently announced that Lake Placid is considering a bid for the winter games of 2022.  Talk of competing for games so far off in the future is difficult to take seriously.  However, on June 26, The New York Times quoted Strack declaring: "Any good plan is a plan that is developed 25 to 30 years in advance."  We'll leave it to the future and our readers to decide whether Mayor Strack is a long-term visionary, or just an opportunistic politician looking to garner some short-term media attention. <p>
<dd>In the meantime, a more immediate effort has begun to bring the summer Olympics of 2008 to New York City.  No doubt, it's an exciting notion.  However, wild-eyed predictions are being made by various politicians and boosters in terms of the impact and costs of actually bringing the Olympics to the Big Apple.  We are told that tens of thousands of new jobs will be created at no cost to New York taxpayers.  Given Mayor Giuliani's similar predictions regarding a new government-built and owned stadium for the Yankees on Manhattan's west side, New Yorkers would be wise to be skeptical of such grand predictions. <p>
<dd>A sober assessment obviously is needed.  And we don't mean an assessment by a consulting firm paid for by the people in favor of the Olympics coming to New York City.  An independent assessment is required.  C&K humbly offers its services. <p>
<dd>First, it is crucial to understand that bringing the Olympics to New York City will in no way cure the city's economic ills.  The actual boost to the economy will be short-term in nature -- albeit probably a substantial economic blip, but a blip nonetheless.  Only deep tax cuts, regulatory relief, and government downsizing will cure New York City's economy, which has been in decline for decades. <p>
<dd>Second, if the games are funded through the private sector -- as is the attempt traditionally -- then whatever boost does occur will be real.  Extensive government involvement will only serve to tarnish the games -- creating numerous inefficiencies and boosting costs.  Fundamentally, private, voluntary funding is always far preferable to government taxation.  The market works far better than government bureaucrats. <p>
<dd>However,  just when New York City seeks the games, of course, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) seems on the verge of making government financial guarantees a part of the Olympics bidding process.  Preliminary cost estimates to bring the games to New York City in 2008 run in the neighborhood of $3.3 billion.  We wouldn't be surprised to see that number rise considerably.  In comparison, the Atlanta games will cost about $1.7 billion. <p>
<dd>One needs to remember that the 1984 games in Los Angeles were the first to actually make money.  The IOC obviously is seeking to protect itself from future losses through government guarantees.  In addition to the clear affront to New York's already overburdened taxpayers, consistent state and city fiscal troubles make such guarantees non-viable. <p>
<dd>In the end, we don't wish to play the part of party spoilers.  We believe New York City should pursue the 2008 Olympic summer games -- and even Lake Placid the winter games of 2022 -- with two provisions: 1) no taxpayer dollars or guarantees should be utilized, and 2) after the games, Olympic venues should be privatized.  After all, the state should be eliminating its Olympic Regional Development Authority, not expanding such a boondoggle. <p>
<dd>The summer Olympics of 2008 in the Big Apple, and the winter games of 2022 back in Lake Placid, are intoxicating ideas.  If taxpayers are not tapped, then C&K looks forward to helping the cause for bringing Olympic sailing contests to the waters around the Statue of Liberty, gold-medal baseball to Manhattan's west side, tennis to Flushing, and perhaps bobsledding and ice skating again to Lake Placid.  We've got tax-free Olympic fever.

<h3><i>Chemical Weapons in New York?</i></h3><p>

<b>by Matthew Carolan and Raymond J. Keating</b></center>
<p><br>
<blockquote>
<hr>
The story line includes chemical weapons, officials from the Hague, and the threat of 
international espionage for hundreds of businesses in New York.  It's not a James Bond film or 
the latest Tom Clancy page-turner, nor is it the paranoid tale of some militia group.
This is the story of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) -- an international treaty 
set to come before the U.S. Senate for ratification by September 14.  The CWC's stated purpose 
is to ban the production and stockpiling of chemical weapons.  Unfortunately, it falls far short of 
such vaunted goals while imposing considerable costs.  <p>
The CWC fails the most basic tests of an arms control treaty.  It is non-enforceable, 
non-verifiable, and does not serve the national interest.  Rogue states will still possess chemical 
weapons; small, mobile production facilities will elude detection; and the U.S. will lose its edge 
in terms of deterrence powers and the development of counter-measures.  		After all, 
proving the "non-existence" of something is an absurd and dangerous requirement on which to 
base a treaty.  As former Reagan Defense Department officials Douglas Feith and Frank Gaffney 
Jr. have noted: "The trouble is the CWC is a bad treaty -- one that will likely increase risk of 
chemical warfare around the world."<p>
And with rogue states emboldened in the chemical weapons trade, can bolder terrorists be 
far behind?<p>
Meanwhile, the costs of the CWC run high for U.S. entrepreneurs and businesses, and 
therefore, for the economy in general.  The international bureaucratic mind runs wild thinking up 
all of the possible ways that chemicals, normally used in quite legitimate and beneficial ways, 
could be turned to perverse ends.  Hence, private, law-abiding industries right here in New York 
will become subject to regulations, paperwork, and inspections from an international agency 
headquartered in the Hague, Netherlands.  Indeed, this would be the first time that U.S. private 
industry confronts foreign inspections.<p>
However, chemical companies are not the only kinds of businesses exposed to the CWC. 
 Enterprises in the food, pharmaceutical, electronics, paint, petroleum, biotech, textiles, 
fertilizers, brewing, distilling, and other industries could be subject to CWC regulations.  
According to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, more than 7,700 facilities in the U.S. are 
likely or possibly subject to the CWC.  In New York, the number stands at 560 facilities -- fourth 
highest among the states.<p>
New York businesses have long suffered from being beaten and battered by often 
senseless federal, state, and local regulations and taxes.  Adding new international regulatory 
burdens with a treaty that certainly does not serve, and may actually undermine national security, 
verges on madness.<p>
Make no mistake, the CWC creates formidable costs.  Time requirements to fill out the 
necessary paperwork on an annual basis range from an estimated 2.5 hours to 9.0 hours per 
chemical depending upon its classification, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.  
Fines for non-compliance range up to $50,000 per incident.  Inspections will cost firms $10,000 
to $50,000 per visit.<p>
Naturally, all these costs weigh far more heavily on smaller businesses.  Small enterprises 
don't possess the requisite experience and resources to deal with increased regulatory burdens.  
Small, entrepreneurial firms, though, drive economic growth and job creation.  As we've long 
seen in New York, as entrepreneurs suffer, so does the economy.<p>
However, no matter how big or small, every business subject to CWC inspections will be 
exposed to the threat of international industrial espionage.  Opportunities to steal U.S. trade 
secrets will be numerous.  <p>
The CWC is a lose-lose treaty.  Costs run high, with absolutely no benefits in the end.  
The only way to prevent the danger of chemical weapons is to show those who might use them 
that the price for such atrocities will be quite dear.  <p>
Thirty-four Senate votes against ratification will kill the deeply flawed CWC, and salvage 
a bit of common sense in Congress.  Sixty-seven votes for the CWC and political symbolism 
wins out over substance once again.  <p>
Senators Moynihan and D'Amato, are you paying attention?<p>

<center><h3>A Doleful Campaign</h3><p>

<i>by Matthew Carolan and Raymond J. Keating</i></center>
<hr>
     In the movie Amadeus, there is a scene which about sums up Bob Dole and his campaign for 
president.  After a performance of his opera, mediocre court composer Antonio Salieri 
approaches his colleague Mozart for his thoughts on the work.  Clearly unimpressed, Mozart 
cleverly replies, "What can one say when one hears such music, but . . . `Salieri'!"<p>
     What can one say when one sees such political strategy, but "Bob Dole," the Antonio Salieri 
of the Republican Party.<p>
     Dole's selection of Susan Molinari to be keynote speaker at the Republican convention is 
typical.  Trailing Bill Clinton by double digits among women voters (the "gender gap"), Dole 
attempts to prop up his sagging campaign with "image" rather than substance and selects what 
New York GOP boss Bill Powers would call "a skirt" -- a pro-choice woman.<p>
     Susan Molinari is a loyal Republican. She's not even much of a maverick on the abortion 
issue. Pat Buchanan likes her.  But can she give a rousing keynote address, a "stemwinder" as 
they say?<p>
     No doubt a woman attacking libidinous Bill Clinton at the convention will be dramatic.  But 
as an establishment Republican, Molinari will do little to solve Dole's problems with his key 
southern and western conservative base.<p>
     Even Molinari's influence with New York Republicans (her husband is Buffalo congressman 
Bill Paxon, her father former Staten Island borough president Guy Molinari) is meaningless.  Al 
D'Amato's GOP will not deliver New York for Dole. <p>
     D'Amato, meanwhile, is flailing about trying to revitalize his friend's anemic presidential bid. 
 D'Amato's criticisms of Dole -- that Dole is distracted by peripheral issues like tobacco and 
tolerance on abortion -- were conventional wisdom.  However, the media coverage D'Amato 
received shows just how desperate writers are for any kind of a story about the Dole campaign.<p>
     D'Amato's attack was not, as many suggest, an attempt to raise his poll numbers for the 
Senate race in 1998.  And while Ray Kerrison is right that D'Amato's criticisms of Dole are 
hypocritical after he blasted Herb London for disloyalty to George Pataki during the 1994 
gubernatorial race, D'Amato is not a "turn coat" just yet.  The Senator's remarks were simply a 
calculated move to make it appear that Dole can learn from his mistakes.  Given Dole's record, 
that's unlikely.<p>
     We will be surprised if Dole's tax-cut plan, to be announced soon, is anything but tepid.  The 
former Senate Majority Leader is stuck between a rock and a hard place.  He desperately needs to 
differentiate himself from Bill Clinton, while on the other hand, Clinton will attack a serious 
Dole tax-cut plan as disingenuous given Dole's long track record of tax hikes.  While this may 
frustrate the GOP rank-and-file, this is exactly what they voted for in the primaries.
Dole's chances -- growing slimmer every day -- lie with proposing a serious pro-growth 
tax plan, selecting a true conservative running mate in order to energize party faithful, and pray 
that scandal news will continue to emanate from the Clinton White House.  Otherwise, he's dead 
in the water.<p>
     Indeed, Republicans should consider dumping Dole at the convention.  One scenario is that 
before Dole gets to San Diego, he announces he'll pick a pro-choice VP, or he badmouths the 
California Civil Rights Initiative aimed at ending racial quotas.  This sends conservatives over 
the edge, and an open convention drafts a pro-life, supply-side conservative like Jack Kemp, 
former congressman from Buffalo.  The gender gap evaporates as the new candidate is forceful 
and sincere about his economic message.  (P.S. If Dole loses, look for establishment types to 
blame the pro-life position, instead of their own milquetoast economic message.)<p>
     Given Dole will lose New York, it's never too late to start thinking about protest votes.  If you 
want to vote for an egocentric crackpot, there's Ross Perot.  Or, you might vote for Libertarian 
candidate Harry Browne.  Libertarians have seen gains recently because their free-market 
philosophy is more sincere than the Republicans.  But there is an unsettling question about 
whether Browne believes in laws against murder!  Stay low and God help us if he actually won.<p>
     A more rational alternative is to write-in a principled, pro-life, economic conservative.  You 
know, somebody the Republican establishment thinks would lose.<p>

<P><br><b>
Addressing the Health Care "Crisis": Markets vs. Regulation
<p></b>
by Matthew Carolan and Raymond J. Keating	
<p>
<i>July 1, 1996</i>
<p><br>
<hr width="85%">
<p><br>
</center>
<blockquote>
We're all at least somewhat familiar with the demise of "Clinton-care."  Upon entering the White House, President and Mrs. Clinton quickly got to work manufacturing a health-care "crisis" in America.  And on that basis, the Clintons tried to seize government control over the health-care industry -- about 14 percent of the U.S. economy.  Their efforts failed as Americans realized that for all of its problems, we still have the best health-care system in the world.  Greater government controls only would have increased health-care costs -- both in terms of more dollars and rationed care.	New York serves as the perfect example.  The health insurance market is heavily regulated in the Empire State.  A 1993 community rating law (a one-size-fits-all government price control), for example, sent costs skyrocketing, pricing some 500,000 individuals out of the health insurance market.  
	Now a Republican-led Congress is moving forward on health-care reform using the failures of both Clinton-care and New York as models, but on a smaller scale.  Led by Senators Ted Kennedy, Democrat from neighboring Massachusetts, and Nancy Kassebaum, Republican from Kansas, health-care reform measures have passed both Houses of Congress with the differences now being hammered out quite publicly.  
	Problem number one is that the Kennedy-Kassebaum plan includes a guaranteed issue requirement.  Guaranteed issue requires insurance companies to supply health insurance to all individuals, with little regard to their medical history or current disposition.  As with most government intrusions into the marketplace, it sounds great at first blush.  However, a moment of reflection reveals that under such a plan individuals possess every incentive to avoid paying for health insurance until the last possible moment -- hiking costs for all insured consumers.  Where tried at the state level -- like in New York -- guaranteed-issue has boosted costs as well as the number of uninsured.	The Senate version of this reform effort also includes an amendment requiring that mental health be placed on par with physical health in insurance plans.  The mental health industry lobbied hard for this amendment.  Not able to keep costs under control, mental health providers want government to force consumption of their services.  
<P>
	The results from such a mandate are quite predictable, including higher costs.  Indeed, premiums are expected to increase between 4% and 12% and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates total direct costs to the employer-based insurance market at $11.6 billion.  Also, the loss of employer-provided health coverage stands as a real threat, with CBO placing the number of Americans likely to lose employer-sponsored health insurance at 800,000.  Other effects include reduced choices in terms of health plans, as well as lost benefits and wages to pay for the additional costs.  	This mental-health mandate is a response to another manufactured crisis.  Right now, 99 percent of employer-based health plans provide some mental health coverage.  So-called "parity" does not exist because mental health is a rather vague notion, offering clear opportunities for abuse, is less easily damaged, and can be very expensive to treat.	The mental-health parity mandate applies to state and local governments -- hiking costs for already overburdened New York taxpayers -- but excludes the federal government's Medicaid and Medicare programs.  The Senators did not want to deal with rising costs in their own programs.	
<P>
One saving grace exists in this current health-care reform effort.  The House version includes a tax-free medical savings account (MSA) provision.  MSAs address the true problems of portability and skyrocketing costs in health care.  The MSA option combines a savings account for health-care expenses and a catastrophic insurance plan.  The employer deposits funds in the employee's MSA each year and whatever is not spent, the employee keeps, but if expenses are higher, catastrophic insurance kicks in.	Everyone benefits under the MSA plan.  Experience at more than 3,000 companies across the U.S. that currently use MSAs (even without federal tax benefits) shows that choices increase and costs decline.  Individuals with both few and many health-care needs have voiced satisfaction.  And as for portability, it's the individual's MSA -- if you move jobs, your MSA moves with you.	
<P>
Broadening the use of MSAs by extending the same tax benefits currently enjoyed only by traditional employer-provided health plans will reduce costs throughout the health-care system.  The main impetus to rising costs in health care are third-party payments.  When either the government or an employer-provided health plan foots the bill, the consumer and supplier of health care services need not concern themselves with costs.  We're all familiar with the doctor giving sample medication to people without insurance, while he writes a prescription for $75 when some big insurance company or the government is paying.  Without the traditional buyer-seller relationship, costs naturally increase.  
<P>
	Congress should let Kennedy-Kassebaum die in conference, and instead, pass a clean MSA bill.  In the meantime, our New York officials should show some leadership and pass tax-free MSAs for New York.  Market choices must replace government micro-management of health care.

New York in the Revolution
<p></b>
by Matthew Carolan and Raymond J. Keating	
<p>
<i>June 24, 1996</i>
<p><br>

<blockquote>
Next week we will mark the 220th year of our nation's independence.  Many New Yorkers will celebrate with familiar rituals: barbecues and beach-going, and a little rebellion against government paternalism with delightful fireworks.	Yet, like so many other patriotic holidays, the Fourth of July has lost much of its meaning.  New York State residents seem blithely unaware of the Empire State's role in the war for independence.  Nor do they realize that as "free" Americans they are now taxed and regulated by government far beyond the levels that drove the colonists to war against the mother country.	Several violations of individual liberty were critical to stirring the colonists' desire for independence. First were the white pine laws of the early 1700s. The British, who wanted the trees for ship-building, declared all pines, even on private land, the property of the crown. Soldiers burned down the homes of colonists who resisted the law.	In the interest of raising revenue for its ventures and thereby violating its limited relationship with the colonies, the British Parliament passed the Stamp Act in 1765.  
<P>
The high tax, denoted by the presence of an official stamp on all news journals, legal documents, and official papers, brought the first cries for independence in an editorial in the New York Gazette.  New Yorkers threatened to destroy the stores of those merchants authorized to collect for the Crown. The Stamp Act Congress met in New York City from October 7 to 25, 1765, and when the first stamps arrived in New York harbor on October 23, riots broke out. Pamphleteers called for boycotts of British goods. A frightened imperial governor even dumped the responsibility for the stamps on the mayor of New York.  Needless to say, the act failed.	Later, in 1773, the British government attempted to control trade in tea. The Boston Tea Party soon followed. New Yorkers, learning from Paul Revere about events in Boston, boarded the merchant ship London and dumped its tea into the East River.  The British responded with "The Intolerable Acts" which suspended Boston's government.  New Yorkers worried that the British could easily suspend their government too, and so called for the first Continental Congress.	
<P>
Militarily speaking, about one-third of all battles in the Revolutionary War were fought in New York State.  Downstate, in the crucial struggle for New York City's harbor, came the Battle of Long Island -- fought in Brooklyn Heights and its outskirts. While it was a disaster for Washington and his men, British General Howe allowed Washington to slip past him to Manhattan Island, and then chased Washington north, eventually all the way to Peekskill, before Washington turned south and escaped to New Jersey.  During this time, Nathan Hale was captured as a spy and executed on the corner of Third and Sixty-Sixth in Manhattan.  New York City would remain in British hands until the end of the war.	
<P>
The other, more successful rebel campaign came upstate, in the years 1777-79, as three different British forces from Canada and New York City attempted to unite around Albany.  They sought to cut off New England from the rest of the colonies.  British general St. Leger, however, was routed on his way down through the Mohawk Valley region.  British General Burgoyne, though, defeating the rebels easily on his way south, was stymied by trees cut down to block the passage of his equipment. Left running out of food and subject to guerrilla attacks, he surrendered at Saratoga, an event which persuaded the French to enter the war on the American side.  In New York City, General Howe left his underling Sir Henry Clinton to both guard New York and meet Burgoyne in the Hudson Valley. Clinton, somewhat successful, came close to catching rebel New Yorkers forming the first state legislature in Kingston, in September 1777, before he was forced to retreat to New York City.	Rebel strength in New York led to the eventual defeat and surrender of Cornwallis, and the British at Yorktown on October 19, 1781.  General Washington proudly entered a liberated New York City in November 25, 1783.  It would eventually become the nation's first capital.  And on April 30, 1789, on the balcony of Federal Hall at Broad and Wall Streets, Washington was inaugurated the nation's first president.  
<P>
	 As historian David Ellis wrote, "No other state suffered more for the cause of independence than did New York. Its frontiers blazed constantly in guerrilla warfare. Armies marched and countermarched through its principal river valleys, strewing death and destruction behind them."  So as you relax and enjoy the beauty of firework displays, recall the sacrifices that took place right under your feet, by the men who desired freedom from tyrannical government.

State Budget Politics: Republican vs. Republican
<p></b>
by Matthew Carolan and Raymond J. Keating	
<p>
<i>June 17, 1996</i>
<p><br>
<hr width="85%">
<p><br>
</center>
<blockquote>
Since coming aboard as New York State budget director in January 1995, Patricia Woodworth has been assailed by Democrats; public-employee unions and other special interests; State Senate Republicans; and some colleagues in the Pataki administration. Obviously she's doing something right.	An experienced and highly competent public servant, before coming to work for Governor Pataki, Patricia Woodworth helped bring fiscal sanity to the state budgets of Governor John Engler in Michigan and Robert Martinez in Florida.  Some tout her as a future budget director for a Republican White House. 	
<P>
Woodworth does not have to be in Albany, she doesn't need this particular job.  We're lucky to have her.  Still, many of our fine New York politicians criticize her as not knowing enough about New York's budget process.  Translation: Woodworth possesses no interest in the seedy, deal-making aspects of the State budget process, and, unlike many of her Republican colleagues, she is deadly serious about cutting the budget.	An assault on Woodworth by Democrats is to be expected. Democrats are at least principled in believing special-interest politics and bigger government are good things. However, State Senate Republicans, who talk about cutting government and taxes, and unleashing the private sector, exhibit little real interest in seeing that happen.  
<P>
They are hypocrites. And now, when the voters expect them to finally come through, they're turning against one of their own, and each other, much to the delight of the Democrats.	The Republican smear campaign against Patricia Woodworth is another instance of GOP pettiness and misogyny, along with the campaign against Betsy McCaughey Ross.  Our sources in Albany report wide acclaim for Woodworth as smart and savvy, who works extremely well with her staff of 350, and who, contrary to the whispers, is intensely loyal to the Governor.  She also has brought improvements to the state budget, which is far more readable now then ever before.  But, as one source told us, "When your the smartest kid in the class, people resent you."	State Republicans have run the state GOP for years like a private men's club.  Everybody is supposed to shut up and do what they're told.  When a woman who speaks her mind and sticks to her guns comes along, the cowards show their real colors and grumble to the media about  bitchy or flighty women.  	
<P>
State Senate cowards, who in this election year haven't the courage to stand up to the unions and other special interests that are strangling New  York taxpayers, also fail to stand up to Woodworth's boss George Pataki either.  So they attack an underling.  Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno sends out a press release calling for "restoration" of $1.2 billion to this years budget, while taking a swipe at the budget director.  His justification for the spending like: Well, it's less than last year's $1.5 billion.  And to think George Pataki dumped Ralph Marino for this guy.	Pataki has stayed above the fray and often seems remarkably dispassionate about a budget process that careens out of control.  But we won't pass final judgement on the Governor's budget performance until everything is finished.  While many pundits criticize the state for chronically late budgets, we're more concerned with the final product.  In the past, Senate Republicans forced late budgets by wrestling with Democrats as to how pork should be doled out.  Thus far, in the Pataki era, budget debates have been more substantive -- about tax cuts and real spending restraint. 
<p> 
If Pataki does not get a budget until July, but gains most of what he wants in terms of spending restraint and program reforms, he'll deserve high marks.  However, if he gets nothing out the current delay, then the Governor will deserve criticism.	In Michigan, Patricia Woodworth saw first-hand that standing by your principles and advancing a budget agenda of less spending and lower taxes is a political winner.  Michigan's John Engler withstood the assault from special interests, carried through with his ideas, and now is wildly popular.  Indeed, Engler may become Bob Dole's running mate for this coming November.	Confronted by big-spending Assembly Democrats and wet-fingered Senate Republicans, Pataki would be wise to give serious weight to the advice he receives from his budget director, while offering her more public support as well.

Recommended Reading for a New York Summer
<p></b>
by Matthew Carolan and Raymond J. Keating	
<p>
<i>June 10, 1996</i>
<p><br>
<hr width="85%">

</center>
<blockquote>
Summer is not only the season for barbecues, the beach, and golf; it remains ideal for reading a good book while sipping a cool drink.  We offer a few suggestions -- books both old and new -- generally in agreement with our conservative views.	First, we offer titles covering national issues.
<P>
<i>Why Government Doesn't Work</i> by Harry Browne (St. Martin's):  An eminently reasonable and readable book just out from the Libertarian candidate for president, explaining how government in the United States went from consuming 3 percent of every American's income in 1900, to 57 percent today (and growing!).
<P>
<i>The Seven Fat Years: And How To Do It Again</i> by Robert L. Bartley (Free Press):  Despite contrary declarations from establishment economists, the Clinton Administration, and much of the media, the U.S. economy is slogging along at an anemic rate of growth.  Bartley not only reveals the policies that lead to robust economic growth and real opportunity, but manages to turn economics into an interesting read.
<P>
<i>Lost Rights</i> by James Bovard (St. Martin's)  Bovard shocks the reader with case after case of law-abiding Americans killed, injured, left unemployed, or without property through the arrogance of our federal government. Keep the Rolaids handy when you read this one. 
<P>
<i>Atlas Shrugged</i> by Ayn Rand (Signet):  This is simply a great work of fiction.  Everyone we know who has read this book says the same thing about it; "It's happening now!"  Rand's huge novel about a mid-20th century America gone mad for economic "fairness" is chilling in its similarities to current events and attitudes among Americans. One overlong, didactic speech (about 50 pages) toward the end tires the reader, but otherwise this is a life-changing read.
<P>
<i>A Good Walk Spoiled</i> by John Feinstein (Little Brown):  This book has nothing to do with politics or economics, it is just a wonderful account of life on the PGA Tour.	Of course, several tomes addressing New York are well worth reading while relaxing in the shade.
<P>
<i>The Rockefellers</i> by Peter Collier and David Horowitz (Holt):  This book has been out of print, so check your library or track it down at a used book store.  A fascinating account of the family that gave us Nelson Rockefeller -- who as governor did more damage to the economy of New York than any other individual in history.
<P>
<i>Senator Pothole</i> by Leonard Lurie (Birch Lane):  Chronicles the rise to power, through Nassau County's sleazy Republican machine, of New York's junior Senator, Al D'Amato.  A bit heavy on detail, but otherwise a clear assessment of everything that is wrong with government serving the interests of the political clubhouse.  
<P>
<i>The Unmaking of a Mayor</i> by William F. Buckley, Jr. (Viking Press): Another out-of-print book worth tracking down.  A fascinating, depressing, and often hilarious account of William F. Buckley Jr.'s run for mayor of New York City in 1965, which effectively put an end to golden-boy liberal Republican John Lindsey's aspirations for higher office.  Nothing has changed in New York City, as this book shows.
<P>
<i>The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York</i> by Robert Caro (Vintage Books):  A Pulitzer-Prize winner detailing the politics of New York State and City -- a fascinating account of arrogance, power, and government run amok.
<P>
<i>The House of Morgan</i> by Ron Chernow (Atlantic Monthly Press):  A fine read about the history of one of New York's great banking houses.  Chernow exhibits an understanding of history, politics and economics, and writes well -- a rare combination. 
<i>Plunkitt of Tammany Hall</i> by William I. Riordan (Dutton): This requires another trip to the library for a classic on the men who wrote the book on New York political corruption.
<P>
<i>The Encyclopedia of New York City</i> edited by Kenneth Jackson (Yale University):  This weighty, oversized, 1,350-page encyclopedia is not easily dragged to the beach, but it should sit at the side of your favorite armchair to be thumbed through during the summer months.  Almost everything you ever wanted to know -- or haven't even thought of -- about New York City is included.  We simply consider it invaluable.	
<P>
Finally, when additional breaks from public policy are in order, we turn to baseball.  As the Yankees compete for the pennant, we recommend another oversized tome -- <i>The Yankee Encyclopedia</i> by Mark Gallagher (Sagamore Publishing).  Stats, player biographies, history of the Stadium, season summaries -- it's all there for an informative summer about the most storied franchise of our national pastime.

New York's Opportunity Dearth
<p></b>
by Matthew Carolan and Raymond J. Keating	
<p>
<i>June 3, 1996</i>
<P><br>
<hr width="85%">
<p><br></center>
<blockquote>
The months of May and June overflow with college and high school graduation ceremonies.  Graduates, flush with optimism, look forward to new opportunities and launching careers.  Unfortunately, due to a dearth of opportunity in New York, many graduates are forced to seek their fortunes elsewhere.
<P>
	A look at the numbers confirms this bleak assessment.  Employment data from the state's Department of Labor for the years 1958 through 1995 (longest period they could supply) is quite depressing -- especially when compared with national figures. From 1959 to 1995, the U.S. annual rate of private-sector job creation topped New York's in all but three years. U.S. private-sector employment expanded by 106 percent between 1958 and 1995, while New York's grew by less than 25 percent. More recently, between 1989 and 1995, New York employment in the private sector fell by 4.6 percent versus U.S. growth of 6 percent.  Over the past year (March 1995 to March 1996), U.S. private-sector employment increased at a 60 percent faster rate than New York's. In 1995, a smaller percentage of New York State's eligible workforce participated in the labor market (60.9 percent) than the national average (66.6 percent), and a smaller share were employed in the once-Empire State -- 57 percent versus 62.9 percent for the entire nation.	New York City, once the state's economic energizer, has hung like an albatross around the neck of the New York State economy for at least the past four decades.  Incredibly, New York City's total level of private-sector employment in 1995 was almost 10 percent lower than in 1958.  From the city's employment peak in 1969, private-sector employment was down by more than 14 percent last year.  	
<P>
The cause of New York's jobs dearth is no mystery.  It results directly from a dearth in entrepreneurship.  After all, in any economy, small, entrepreneurial enterprises create the bulk of new jobs.  The formation of new firms and new business incorporations in New York -- two measures of entrepreneurial activity -- lag well behind the nation as a whole.
	From their respective 1987 and 1988 highs, new firms in New York were down by almost 12 percent in 1993 and new business incorporations off by 9 percent.  At the same time, new firms and new business incorporations across the nation reached record highs in 1993.  As for New York City, fewer small businesses called it home in the early 1990s than did in 1969.	Why are entrepreneurs verging on extinction in New York?  Quite simply, the answer is big government.  High taxes and onerous regulations have chased away investors and entrepreneurs.	A new report by one-half of Carolan & Keating (i.e., by Keating) published by the Small Business Survival Foundation ranks the 50 states and the District of Columbia according to the environment for entrepreneurship.  The Small Business Survival Index combines nine key government-related costs -- the personal income tax, capital gains tax, corporate income tax, property taxes, sales taxes, unemployment taxes, workers' compensation costs, estate taxes, and the crime rate -- into one comparative measure.  New York State ranks a dismal 46th out of 51.  
<P>
When added into the mix, New York City replaced the lowly District of Columbia as worst in the nation -- by far -- for economic risk taking.	Unfortunately, few, if any, of New York's elected officials realize how heavily government weighs on the economy.  Governor George Pataki deserves some credit for cutting income taxes and restraining the growth in state spending, but so much more needs to be done and we seriously question if he has the courage to do it.  As we've said before, State Senate Republicans simply blow with political winds -- last year fighting for tax cuts and spending restraint and this year crying out for higher state expenditures.  State Assembly Democrats stand as the major roadblock to pro-growth tax reduction, deregulation, and government downsizing.  At the local level, Republicans, Democrats, and school boards across the state seem content to continue hiking expenditures and taxes.	Most tragically, perhaps, New York City promises to continue as an economic basket case for the foreseeable future.  Mayor Giuliani apparently possesses little understanding of the true source of the city's woes.  He is willing to dole out more than $1.1 billion in corporate welfare for new ballparks for the Yankees and Mets, but has reneged on his promise to allow the city's personal income tax surcharge to expire at the end of this year.  The city's top personal income tax rate was scheduled to drop from 4.46 percent to 3.91 percent -- a small, but necessary first step to recovery.  Instead, Giuliani proposes a four-year extension of the surcharge.
<P>
	Of course, such an extension requires state legislative approval.  If state officials truly want to help New York City, they would forget about Giuliani's extension and allow the surcharge to expire.	Until taxes and government are cut deeply in New York, entrepreneurs and investors will continue to flee the state and many graduates will follow.

Polluted Thought(Second in a two-part series)
<p></b>
by Matthew Carolan and Raymond J. Keating	
<p>
<i>May 27, 1996</i>
<p><br>
<hr width="85%">
<p><br>
</center>
<blockquote>
As we discussed in our last column, today's "preservationist" environmentalism has wrought untold damage to our legal rights.  Through vague laws, arbitrary prosecutions, the regulation of private land in ways that destroy its value, and the use of tax money to buy land for no human use, preservationists have sought to impose their vision of "the public good" on America.	
<P>
Consider the recent Clinton Administration plan for federal "ecosystem management."  Preservationist Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt is pushing for a National Biological Survey to map and therefore "manage" every "ecosystem" in the United States. Once "discovered," these systems become the foundation for all future federal legislation.
<p>	
What's an ecosystem?  Well, that's a problem.  Babbitt observed in a 1993 congressional hearing that "...to some degree, an ecosystem is in the eye of the beholder." 	 As Alan Fitzsimmons, a Virginia-based environmental consultant, puts it, ecosystems are "mental constructs," simplifying tools of scientific research.  They are, Fitzsimmons notes, "arbitrary" "imprecise" and "variable over time."  Any portion of land can be simultaneously in hundreds of different ecosystems, because scientists define them as they go along. There is no scientific consensus on objective ecosystems.	One might think it curious that the federal government would want to make law based on something so shifting and arbitrary.  Not if it supports preservationist land grabs. If ecosystems are to be managed, the private land they invariably run over must be "managed" as well.	
<P>
New York State's Department of Environmental Conservation, working closely with the Nature Conservancy, has similar mapping plans. They want to move as much private land use regulation away from localities as possible.	Such "global thinking" has lead to a plethora of big government agencies working with special interests to "protect" their "ecosystems" and other artificial mental constructs. A few of New York's many examples:<br>	--The International Joint Commission (IJC) oversees the Great Lakes "ecosystem," touching on northwestern New York.  At the behest of Greenpeace, the IJC recommended "sunsetting" (i.e., eliminating) all use of chlorine-based chemicals.  
<P>
Respected scientists like Nobel laureate Mario Molina and toxicologist Steven Safe have described this as sheer lunacy.  As the American Council on Science and Health protests, chlorine is mankind's only effective source of cholera prevention, and is essential to the cheap production of cancer fighting drugs, vitamins, and even pipes that reduce water pollution.  Short-sighted environmentalists ignore the costs in human lives such a policy would bring.  Though concern for human life usually sits rather low on the preservationist agenda.  
<P>
And, not surprisingly, the Clinton Administration has accepted the chlorine proposal and is studying its implementation.	--There's also the recent attempt to make the entire Catskill region, including the cities of Plattsburgh and Glens Falls, a United Nations regulated "biosphere."  (We're not making this stuff up.)	--The Northern Forest Lands Project was initiated by Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont and supported by the Sierra Club, National Audubon, etc. This alleged "ecosystem" runs 26,000,000 acres, across about 40 percent of the combined land mass of New York, New Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine.  Problem is, it's not a continuous "forest."  There are all kinds of farms in between and the land is naturally heterogeneous, but why let the facts stop you from regulating an ecosystem?
	
The real danger of preservationism is its socialist premises.  You don't own your property, the "concerned" take care of it for "everyone."  Preservationists have been quite busy undermining private property, the Founding Fathers' most sacred weapon against tyranny, enshrined in the Bill of Rights.	Of course, New York State features several of the country's leading authorities on the law of "public trust," which means some things are just so important, like "ecosystems," that the government must protect them even without compensating the property owner.  Some of these advocates reside at the Government Law Center of Albany Law School and Pace University Law School (home of darling boy of the New York media, environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr.).	
<P>
Public trust advocates admit it is a very vague idea. As Patty Salkin of the Government Law Center wrote last December, "An exact definition of a public resource is difficult to articulate."  But, as Robert Reis of the University of Buffalo Law School wrote, as public trust doctrine grows, "correlative private rights . . . would be precluded or significantly diminished."	If you are as bothered by all this as we are, you may wish to contact the Property Rights Foundation of America in Stony Creek, NY (518-696-5748).  Their research and publications will help you through this legal swamp (or is it a legal "wetland" these days?).  Remember Thomas Jefferson's words: "Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty."

<blockquote>
The Founding Fathers believed civil order could not stand without a secure right to property. The Bill of Rights forbids government from taking property, even for "the public good," without fair compensation for the owner.	This latter protection, derived from English Law, introduces today's self-anointed environmental do-gooder to the cold facts of economic life.  That is, unless he finds some way around the law -- as environmentalists across America and here in New York regularly do.	Some years ago, groups like the National Audubon Society respected private property by practicing "conservationism."  Hunters, fishermen, and bird lovers would pay to protect natural things, buying farms and forests, rare birds, etc.	But later, especially following Earth Day 1970, came "preservationism," a theory which sees nature as better left alone by man (preserved).  A quasi-religious philosophy, preservationism wants wild, dehumanized nature to be promoted by government.	
<P>
Today, preservationists are using taxpayer money to achieve their dreams.  Billions have been spent to buy land for no human use.  (In 1992, the State Department of Environmental Conservation spent $40,000,000 to buy one plot of Long Island property, at a cost of $117,000 an acre!)	Where property owners stand in the way, as in the Adirondacks, government agencies engage in "regulatory takings," allowing the property owner to keep the title, but restricting use in such a way as to destroy its value.	One Supreme Court decision illustrates this precarious situation: In South Carolina, David Lucas took a million dollar mortgage to buy waterfront land where he hoped to build two homes. The state passed a law denying his ability to build, in the name of protecting the view, preserving a "habitat," etc.  Lucas' land plummeted in value.  
<P>
Eventually the Supreme Court ruled he had to be compensated, but only because he lost 100 percent of the land's value.  If he lost less, the state would not have to compensate him, gaining a "public good" at the expense of the property owner!	In New York, the Department of Environmental Conservation has a list of land it wants to acquire or control.  The mere presence of a lot of property on that list can cause it to depreciate in value, as its use might be restricted.  Who compensates the homeowner?  Nobody.  When state government bodies, like the Adirondack Park Agency, make rulings about the use of property, who absorbs the cost?  The property owner.	
<P>
According to the Property Rights Foundation of America, based in Stony Creek, New York, approximately 64% of all New York State land is under or at serious risk of falling under preservationist control through either government ownership (bought with taxpayer dollars) or regulation.  And federal, state and local governments plan more acquisitions, in the Adirondacks, the Hudson Valley, the Finger Lakes, the Long Island Pine Barrens, etc.
	Equating preservationism with the "public interest" leads to conflicts of interest. For example, the head of one state zoning agency, the Hudson River Greenway Council, has legally received his salary directly from environmental special interests. Such behavior is illegal for almost any other public official.	Preservationism leads to bad legislation. Though the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, etc. sound impressive, they place vague and even contradictory goals into the law. Determination of what it means to preserve "biodiversity," "ecosystems," and "wetlands" has been turned over to unelected, unsupervised bureaucrats, leading to what Timothy Lynch, constitutional scholar at the CATO Institute, calls a "regulatory police state."	
<P>
Technical violations of federal law become impossible to avoid.  Prosecutions with political motives -- like appearing to be "tough on polluters" -- are skyrocketing.  Activist judges hold preservation so important they rule the federal government may prosecute someone who has neither intended to commit the crime (mens rea) or actually physically committed the crime (actus reus).  One man who simply removed tires from a dump was sentenced to three years in prison, and a $202,000 fine for altering a "wetland."	Then there's "bounty hunting," where environmental lawyers scrutinize paperwork for technical violations, then forcing businesses to pay settlements in the form of "contributions" to environmental groups.  You won't see that in the Sierra Club fundraising letters!	Assemblyman Richard Brodsky of Westchester, no friend of private property, has introduced legislation that would allow bounty hunting at the state level.  The Governor supports it!  What would the Conservative Party think, given their Contract with New York calls for controls on the environmentalists?

Government's Magic Wand
<p></b>
by Matthew Carolan and Raymond J. Keating
<p>
<i>May 13, 1996</i>

<blockquote>
	Politicians rarely make good economists.  In particular, we've come to expect rather sloppy economic thinking from Democrats over the years.   However, in New York, Republicans often are just as stupid as Democrats when it comes to the economy. Democrats and Republicans at the federal, state, city, and local levels across New York have raised taxes, increased regulatory burdens, and expanded the size of government, all in apparent blissful ignorance of the economic damage they inflict.  Now, members of both parties are clamoring to boost the minimum wage.  	
<P>
The minimum wage serves as one of those "compassion" issues politicians love to bandy about periodically.  With a wave of its magic wand, government simply declares that the minimum wage should be increased by 90 cents from $4.25 to $5.15 per hour -- President Clinton's current proposal -- and the poor will derive great benefits.  Of course, if the economy really worked that way, then why be such Scrooges?  Why not wave the magic wand of government compassion and increase the minimum wage to $10 per hour, or even $25 or $50 per hour? In reality, the minimum wage hurts those it purports to help, along with a host of small business owners as well.  Raising the price of teenage and low-skilled workers simply decreases the demand for them -- resulting in lost jobs.  Standard estimates of entry-level jobs lost due to a 90-cent minimum wage hike range from 130,000 to as many as 400,000.  And the U.S. Congressional Budget Office estimates that the current proposed increase in the minimum wage would boost direct costs for U.S. businesses by $12.5 billion over five years. 	For many workers, the minimum wage removes the first rung on the ladder of economic opportunity, with grim consequences.  
<p>
The habits, skills, and training that only come with employment are lost.  Welfare becomes a much more viable economic course as a result, with all of its foul effects for families and individuals.	Minimum wage supporters cry that the real value of the minimum wage has been eroded by inflation over the years, and the proposed increase merely seeks to recoup such losses.  Some advocate not only a hike in the minimum wage, but indexing the wage for inflation.  Sounds a lot like France, where the minimum wage rests at roughly $7.50 per hour, rising whenever inflation hits 2 percent.  Of course, France's unemployment rate runs at about twice the U.S. rate and job creation since at least 1980 essentially has been nonexistent. 	
<P>
At the state level, Democrats remain undeterred by the dismal economics of the minimum wage.  Their union supporters love minimum wage increases, utilizing such hikes to help argue for raises for their own members.  In mid-April, New York State Assembly Democrats voiced frustration with Republican foot-dragging in bringing the minimum wage hike to a vote in Washington, so they voted to increase the minimum wage in New York from $4.25 to $5.05.  	One might think that Republicans -- the party alleged to possess some understanding of markets -- would argue against minimum wage increases.  Not in New York.  Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno  recently declared his support for a minimum wage hike, but preferred the increase to occur at the federal level.  Bruno does not exactly shine as a profile in courage viewed from either side of this issue.  
<P>
	A clearer, but equally bad position emanates from various New York members of the U.S. House of Representatives.  A group of them served as original co-sponsors on a bill introduced on April 18 to raise the minimum wage by a dollar per hour -- even higher than President Clinton's proposal.  These New York Republicans favoring wage and price controls are Jack Quinn, Benjamin Gilman, Jim Walsh, Amo Houghton, Sherwood Boehlert, Rick Lazio, and Mike Forbes.  	
<P>
New York GOP party boss and U.S. Senator Al D'Amato quickly jumped on board the minimum wage bandwagon as well.  D'Amato is currently flailing around, grasping at any issue that might boost his sagging popularity.  (Perhaps the Senator will lash out at opponents of the minimum wage as economic ayatollahs?) With New York being such a prominent union state, these Republicans have thrown away sound economics in the hopes of political gain.  That is, pandering to big labor.  Such a strategy, of course, is laughable as unions will oppose these Republican re-election effort in New York with all of their power and resources.	In the meantime, other Republicans struggle for a plan to counter a minimum wage hike.  Here's our three-step solution, based on sound, pro-growth economics: 1) eliminate the minimum wage, opening up job opportunities for teenage, low-skilled workers, 2) cut income and payroll taxes so people can take home more of the money they earn, and 3) eliminate both federal and New York State capital gains taxes, boosting incentives for investing and entrepreneurship -- the true sources of economic growth and job creation.  It's the most compassionate thing to do.

<P><br><b>
Two Catholics and the Death Penalty 
<p></b>
by Matthew Carolan and Raymond J. Keating	
<p>
<i>May 6, 1996</i>
<P><br>
<hr width="85%">
<p><br>
<blockquote></center>
When George Pataki defeated Mario Cuomo in 1994, many saw the death penalty as a decisive issue in the race.  New Yorkers were worried about crime, and demanded tough measures. Cuomo vetoed death-penalty legislation 12 years in a row, claiming the penalty immoral and ineffective, and cited the teaching of his Church on the issue. Pataki, also a Catholic, stuck to the hard facts of crime and appeals to common sense.
<p>
	In a state with so many Catholic politicians and voters, appeals to Christian responsibility abound on this issue. Just this past week, Cuomo again cited the influence of his Church (and activist nun Sr. Camille D'Arienzo) and announced that he has signed a card indicating that should he be murdered, he does not want his killer to get the death penalty. (Of course, we all knew that already.)
<p>	
But then again, that's often the point for Mario Cuomo, who has made a career out of telling people all about his conscience; how it would not let him "impose his beliefs" concerning abortion, but it would let him impose his beliefs when redistributing people's income, or making them wear seat belts, or vetoing the death penalty. Now he would like to impose his conscience on New York from the grave.
<p>	
Personally, we prefer the Pataki approach to moral belief, refreshingly understated, and, at least on the death penalty, more in tune with his Church than many realize.	According to the Catholic Church's "Universal Catechism," which is meant to serve as a compendium of Catholic belief, the state has the right to punish evildoers, "not excluding, in cases of extreme gravity, the death penalty." (2266)  In the next section however, (2267), the Church calls for the use of "bloodless means" when "sufficient" to defend the public good.  The debate for Catholics then centers around who determines what punishment is "sufficient."	Catholic liberals have seized on section 2267, and a passing remark by Pope John Paul II in the encyclical letter "Evangelium Vitae" or "Gospel of Life," to argue that the Pope now teaches that the death penalty is always wrong. (A most curious position for a group of people who regularly deny the Pope's authority to pronounce on matters of abortion or artificial birth control.)
<p>
	Under Catholic doctrine, the Pope can only define entire classes of acts wrong for Catholics. Such acts are considered "intrinsically evil," independent of the circumstances.	But the Pope has made no such declaration about "all" acts of the death penalty.  He comes close, but leaves the door open, saying that public authorities "ought not go to the extreme of executing an offender except in cases of absolute necessity: in other words, when it would not be possible otherwise to defend society," adding his personal opinion about the state of present law enforcement: "such cases are very rare, if not practically non-existent."	While we have great respect for John Paul II, based on Catholic thought itself, the Pope, or any bishop, enjoys no more authority to judge the morality of a particular death-penalty case than your local auto mechanic.  Theirs is simply a prudential opinion, not an authoritative judgement for Catholics, and they have no idea how likely it is, in particular prisons, that killers serving life sentences, might kill, sodomize, or otherwise brutalize fellow inmates or guards.	In an interview following the death of Bronx police officer Kevin Gillespie, John Cardinal O'Connor reluctantly admitted as much. While urging mercy, he noted: "There is no question that the state has the right to exercise the death penalty if it judges it the only way to protect society."  The judgement, the Cardinal notes, belongs to the state.	But there is even more to the issue than "protecting society."  Too few clerics seem willing to acknowledge that the death penalty, like all punishment, is about justice -- what the criminal deserves for his crime.	Sacred Scripture, always authorative for the Christian, reminds us of this truth.  In Romans 1:28-32, Paul tells us of acts that "deserve death."  And Numbers 35:16 tells us that "the murderer shall be put to death."  Without the idea of just punishment, pious calls for "mercy" make no sense.
<p>	
The Christian tradition then, despite the protestations of some religious people, clearly asserts that murderers may receive justice (death), and that it is the state's business to dispense it, and maybe mercy as well.  In New York, that heavy responsibility falls on George Pataki, the courts, and the state legislature.	As Christians ourselves, we are content to accept this tradition.  In the end, unlike Mario Cuomo, we believe the death penalty exists to protect the living, not to prove the moral superiority of the dead.
<P>

Public-Sector Unions and Privatization 
<p></b>
by Matthew Carolan and Raymond J. Keating
<p>
<i>April 29, 1996</i><p><br>
<hr width="85%">
<p><br>
</center>	
<blockquote>
We'd like to introduce the Carolan-Keating law of public policy.  It serves as a thumb-nail measure of how much support or opposition a public policy initiative deserves: If public-sector-union officials strongly oppose an initiative then it's worthy of support, and anything they support is worth opposing.	Public-sector unions thrive on big government.  The more taxpayer money government spends, the more jobs and influence for unions.  And since union membership is on the decline in the private sector, government serves as the last bastion of unions.  	
<P>
Therefore, sound public policy steps, like tax cuts, deregulation, school choice, and spending reductions, attract vehement opposition from public-sector unions.  In fact, as we have seen in New York in recent years, these unions often resort to hyperbolic television, radio, and newspaper scare ads.  	The issue riling unions most today is privatization.  Indeed, if you want to liven up the next cocktail party you're attending, find a public-sector-union official, mention privatization, and watch the sparks fly.  (We have, and it's great sport!)	Privatization means selling government-owned assets or shifting services completely out of the realm of government and into the private sector.  The taxpayers no longer possess any ties to the asset or service.  A step child to privatization is competitive contracting, whereby private enterprises regularly bid to provide services while taxpayers still foot the bill.  	
<P>
The benefits of privatization and competitive contracting are clear: 1) selling assets generates revenues that should be applied to debt retirement or rainy day funds, 2) shifting services completely to the private sector relieves taxpayers of the costs, and improves the quality of those services through competition and the profit motive, 3) in the case of pure privatization, government stops competing with private businesses, and 4) allowing companies to compete to provide services saves taxpayer dollars.	However, privatization has had a particularly rough time in New York, the number one union state in the country.  Almost 29 percent of all workers in New York are union members -- highest proportion in the nation and almost twice the national average.  	
<P>
Nonetheless, Governor Pataki at times musters the courage to utter the "p" word.  For example, the Governor has pushed for privatizing state-owned Stewart Airport.  Even New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani has tested the privatization waters by putting the U.N. Plaza Hotel up for sale.  And the New York-New Jersey Port Authority actually privatized its Vista Hotel in Manhattan for more than $140 million.  (That's right, government in New York owns and operates hotels!)	Activists Ron Lauder and Allen Roth deserve considerable credit for teaching the privatization gospel in New York.  Unfortunately, the Democrats express no interest in privatization -- unwilling to offend their union supporters -- and Republicans often forget their lessons.  For example, in complete contrast to the privatization movement, Governor Pataki supports a state takeover of the Long Island Lighting Company (LILCO)!	Much can and needs to be privatized at both the state and local levels in New York.  
<P>
Candidates for privatization are numerous, including public housing (sell it or even give it away), airports, horse race tracks, Off-Track Betting (patronage mill and retirement home for politicians), golf courses (New York State owns 18 with many more owned by counties, cities and towns), marinas, ski resorts (the state owns Gore and Whiteface Mountain ski centers), theaters, stadiums (don't build new stadiums for the Mets and Yankees, privatize Yankee and Shea Stadiums), buildings (how about the World Trade Center?), arenas (Nassau Coliseum -- home to the New York Islanders), mass transit services (buses, trains and subways), convention centers, hospitals, and prisons.  
<P>
Competitive contracting opportunities are widespread as well, such as operating state and local parks, trash pick up, road maintenance and snow removal, workfare programs, and more.  	Oh, and of course, after the state takes over LILCO, that too will be a candidate for privatization.	In addition to saving taxpayer dollars and improving services, very often workers find expanded opportunity through privatization that would not exist in a straightforward government job.  In fact, the only clear losers under privatization are the officials who sit atop public-sector unions.  Clear proof supporting the Carolan-Keating law of public policy.

Lotto Fever Spells Social Decline 
<p></b>
by Matthew Carolan and Raymond J. Keating
<p>
<i>April 22, 1996</i>
<p><br>
<hr width="85%">
<p> <br>
<blockquote>
</center>
	Last week, Governor Pataki announced a change in the advertising campaign for the New York State Lottery.  The new tack will focus on Lotto's benefits to education, and drop the "get-rich-quick" theme. Perpetuating such an image, the Governor says, "is not the proper role for government."	Like so many New York Republicans who talk about reducing the role of government, but do little, Governor Pataki comes to the right church, but sits in the wrong pew.	Changing an ad campaign merely alters appearances, not substance.  The reason to play any game of chance, even one run by the state, is to try to win money.  Being told the money will benefit education acts as a mere palliative -- and amounts to a budgetary lie.	The lottery's net receipts of $1.5 billion is like all other money: fungible.  If friends give you a new car, you no longer have to save for that car.  Your money in the bank is freed up for other things.  The same occurs in Albany.  Lotto frees up money for pork-barrel projects -- education related and otherwise.  Indeed, by creating the appearance of an ever-growing stream of revenue aimed at schools, the lottery allows Albany to abdicate responsibility for a cost-effective public school system.	
As we have argued elsewhere, the surest path to better education is to end government's monopoly and institute school choice.  Costs would fall, while service improves. 	We hear that the lottery also helps small businesses, such as bars, stationary stores, luncheonettes, etc., stay afloat -- more fiscal fiction.  The best way to boost business remains by cutting the sales tax, the business tax, capital gains and personal income taxes, as well as all those crushing fees and regulations.	The perpetuation of lottery games in New York indicates a government that can't stop spending.  Instead, the state comes up with more and more baroque schemes for bilking the taxpayer.  From the original creation of one Lottery game in 1966, we have seen an explosion of new games: Lotto Take Five (twice a week); Lotto 54 (twice a week); Three Digit Daily Number; Daily Number "Win 4"; Instant Scratch-Off games with silly themes like Luck of the Irish, etc.; and Keno games like Pick 10 and the now infamous "Quick Draw."	Have you ever been in a bar or restaurant where Quick Draw is played?  It's a sorry spectacle, where hard-working folks drop $10, $20, or $50 a night playing the game, with all the rational deliberation that a few beers will bring.  No wonder so many family groups across the state oppose Quick Draw. 	And we've all heard the whispers about low-income individuals lining up to spend what little money they have on the state's games of chance, desperately hoping to escape the cycle of poverty.  In contrast, a good education and a bustling employment market would make a real difference in people's lives. 
<P>
 Unfortunately, New York's big government obstructs such developments.	George Will once described the lottery as "a tax on fools," a way of encouraging people to believe they can get ahead by something other than hard work, education, and moral self-improvement.  While we all have our own little vices -- human nature being human nature -- should our government prey upon such weaknesses?	What's more, a lottery game can only flourish in a society where people have religious faith -- a belief in a power higher than themselves. Nearly everybody who's bought a Lotto ticket has thought to themselves at one time or another, "I know God will help me out here, because He knows my desperate situation. He knows I will do some good with this money."  The lottery exploits that belief in divine providence. It encourages spiritual solipsism, where folks think they are the only ones in God's kind universe. Is that what we want our government to do?	Try fitting that into an ad campaign, Governor.

<blockquote>
Tax time has come and gone once again.  How much Albany demands in state personal and business taxes never fails to shock us.  If the morose effects of your tax bill are beginning to fade, however, allow us to send you back into deep depression with the bad news about where much of your precious money ends up year after budget year.	How about $50,000 going to the "East End Economic and Environmental Institute Wine Symposium," $50,000 to a "grape entomologist," or $150,000 to a zoo in Utica?  There's also $2,000 to the New York City Sailing Association; $25,000 to buy bleachers for parks in Ohio, NY; $12,500 for a bike path on Grand Island; and $21,500 for the Attica Rodeo and Show Association.	 The list seems never ending: $300,000 for a design and construction study for the Sports and Entertainment Center on Long Island, $10,000 for the Museum of Television and Radio, $348,200 for the "Dairy Farm Productivity and Profitability Project," $1,840 to the Leisure Club of Mineola, $250,000 for the National Soccer Hall of Fame, and $25,000 to PAWS, the Protection Animal Welfare Society (how cute).	Welcome, dear New Yorkers, to the world of "member items," pork-barrel spending that has become so ingrained in the life of Republicans and Democrats in Albany no one bothers question it any more.  
<P>
The items above are but a smidgen of what can be found in New York State budgets over the last three years. The actual amount of member-items waste runs into the tens of millions of dollars per year.	Supporters call it the cost of getting things done, "greasing the wheels of democracy," if you will.  We call it greasing the palms of special interests.  Next time you hear state politicians bleating about apocalyptic budget cuts and the resulting "devastation," remember these and countless other pork items in the annual state budget.	This year, because of the federal budget impasse, Albany has decided to snooze waiting for Bill Clinton, Bob Dole and Newt Gingrich to come to terms and determine how much federal taxpayer money and savings will come New York's way.  Continuing resolutions will do nothing to attack the real problems of New York's profligate spending.  And since a finalized federal budget seems unlikely until after the November elections, it's time for our friends in Albany to get to work, changing the priorities of the Empire State.  
<P>
It's time to say good-bye not only to member items, but to entire departments of state government.	For example, the state could eliminate each of its so-called "economic development" agencies with no negative impact on New York's economy.  In fact, to the contrary, the state economy would benefit.  On the chopping block (proposed 1996-97 budgets in parentheses) should be the Department of Economic Development ($55.2 million), the Empire State Development Corporation ($124.2 million), the Energy and Development Authority ($57.9 million), New York State Science and Technology Foundation ($24 million), Department of Agriculture and Markets ($65.9 million), Division of Housing and Community Renewal ($253.7 million), and the Olympic Regional Development Authority ($10.8 million) with its two state ski resorts.  	After all, market promotion, loans, housing construction, commercial research, running ski resorts, and venture capital investment are better left to individuals and entrepreneurs in the marketplace rather than to state bureaucrats.  State government should not be competing with private-sector firms.  These state development agencies merely supply patronage jobs for the relatives, friends, and political associates of elected officials, serving as unadulterated wastes of taxpayer dollars.	Funding of the arts should be left to the private sector as well.  Eliminating the state's Council on the Arts and funding for public television and radio would save about $47 million.  	
<P>
We've only scratched the surface by mentioning a few departments ready for termination.  Billions of dollars in cuts are available in the really big state departments, like Education, Labor, Health, Transportation, Parks, and Social Services.	New Yorkers need to do more than complain about their taxes each April.  They've got to make the link between big government and high taxes.  In a state budget topping $63 billion, myriad opportunities for savings exist.  Alas though, deep spending and tax cuts won't happen until the voters start sending legislators to Albany who realize that government is merely a necessary evil, not a pinata stuffed with goodies waiting to be broken open each year.

The Case for Competition in Education
<p></b>
by Matthew Carolan and Raymond J. Keating
<P>
<i>April 8, 1996</i>
<p><br>
<hr width="85%">
<p><br>
</center>
<blockquote>
     In a recent Washington Post article, Nobel-Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman warned of a growing danger in American society. We are, he said, splitting into two types of people: those who are well-educated and highly skilled -- the"cognitive elite" -- and those who are being left behind by our current educational system -- low-skilled, poorly educated, and unable to compete technologically and politically in a rapidly changing world.    
<P>
 The legendary Gordon Moore of Intel, who famously predicted the rapid technological change brought on the by the microchip, expresses similar concerns.     These men, and others, are not worried about technical or vocational skills per se. They are concerned about the way our society is changing from an industrial to an information-based society.  A society making more demands on the minds, and less on the muscles of future American workers. These workers will need like never before the power to read, write, think critically, and master advanced concepts.     
<P>
Our school system, however, has shown that it is not up to the task.  In New York, while inflation-adjusted per pupil public school expenditures have increased by 80 percent since the early 1970s, SAT scores have plummeted from 937 in 1972 to 892 in 1995.  New York once exceeded the national average SAT score, but now trails considerably.      When you add in the high incidence of rape, robbery, drug abuse, teacher assault, and vandalism in schools, especially in the inner-city, as well as a dramatic increase in remedial courses at the college level designed to clean up English and math skills, it is clear our educational system, and America, is in trouble.     
<P>
The reason?  An educational monopoly, dominated by the world's most powerful special interests: the National Educational Association (NEA), the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), and here, the New York State United Teachers (NYSUT). The money these groups spend to maintain the status quo is staggering.  Indeed, in Albany, no other special interest group is better financed or wields greater power, over both Democrats and Republicans, than the education unions.     
<P>
Unlike people who work in private industry, where one must produce to make a living, the educational monopoly stifles performance.  Under collective bargaining, bad teachers are protected, good teachers receive no incentives.  What's worse, it's very hard to take a child out of the system.  Parents who look for a better educational product in our private schools still must pay once in taxes to fund the bad school and then once again in tuition.  Of course, public schools possess no incentives to cut costs.     
<P>
As we have found about New York, cost per pupil in public school districts can be astronomical.  The lowest cost in New York, based on 1992-93 figures, was $5,395 in the Portville school district.  But about half the districts in New York spend more than $8,000 annually, 25 percent spend more than $10,000, seven districts even spend more than $20,000, with two districts on Long Island -- Bridgehampton and Fire Island -- exceeding a whopping $31,000 per student!  Compare that with the average cost per pupil of private schools, somewhere around $3000.     
<P>
Giving parents a choice in education, through a system of vouchers or tax credits is the only way to break free from the educational monopoly, and renew American education.  And it is a proposal that is beginning to take hold across the country, what Milton Friedman sees as an impending tidal wave.  School choice plans are now in place in 20 states and the District of Columbia -- some privately financed and others through taxpayer dollars.       
<P>
In New York State, a bill called "The Elementary and Secondary Education Improvement Act" is now in committee.  While it still has a long way to go, signs are hopeful. C&K hears rumors that Governor Pataki supports school choice, and the Conservative Party has made choice part of it's Contract with New York for the fall elections.     Teachers' union officials have not yet launched a full scale assault on the bill, but according to sources in Albany, union lobbyists have been "dropping by" legislators' offices, hoping perhaps to strangle the bill in the cradle.  The growth in popularity of the measure must have them worried. Originally introduced in 1993 with only State Senator Serphin Maltese as a sponsor, the bill has grown each year, to its current level of 18 co-sponsors.     
<P>
Tim Mulhearn, of United New Yorkers for Choice in Education, and one of the architects of the bill, and Don Woods, of Citizens for Excellence in Education, think that once some minor changes are made to protect home schoolers and religious-school identity, the conservative coalition across New York will mobilize on behalf of the measure.     They also note, though, that this is not a conservative issue alone. Even some liberals like Assemblyman Dov Hikind are supporting the bill.  And why not?  Shouldn't everyone, not just the wealthy, have access to excellence in education?     As Milton Friedman notes, the private sector has done more to improve the standard of living in the last 200 years then all government could do in the previous 2000. It's time to completely unleash that power in education, as New York and America head into a challenging new era.

NY Baseball and the Stench of Corporate Welfare
</b>
<p>
by Matthew Carolan and Raymond J. Keating
<p>
<i>April 1, 1996</i>
</center><P><br>
<hr width="85%">
<p><br>
<blockquote>

	The crack of the bat, the neatly mowed grass, the call for "hot dogs" -- professional baseball is back New York.  Unfortunately, so is the odor of corporate welfare and stadium socialism.  Politicians stand ready to subsidize baseball's millionaire owners and athletes with taxpayer dollars --  a sad trend stretching across the state and the country.
<p>	
Take New York City's professional teams for instance.  The Mets and Yankees are crying out for new, taxpayer-financed venues to replace the city-owned stadiums that currently house them.	The Mets seek an Ebbets Field-style ballpark, with modern amenities like a retractable dome.  The total cost will likely top $400 million, with the Mets reportedly looking for New York City -- i.e., taxpayers -- to foot about $100 million of the bill.  	
<P>
That's a bargain compared to what George Steinbrenner wants for his Yankees, anything from a mere $400 million upgrade to the current Yankee Stadium to a new ballpark on Manhattan's west side where costs could easily reach more than $1 billion.  Don't expect too much, if anything, in the way of stadium dollars from Steinbrenner, who stands ready to bolt with his team to eager New Jersey if he doesn't get a good deal.	Stadium socialism is not limited to just New York City and major league teams, however.  Two years ago, state taxpayers forked over more than $110 million for minor league stadium improvements or completely new ballparks across the state.  Tens of millions of state dollars were allocated for facilities in places like Syracuse, Auburn, Batavia, Dutchess County, Elmira, Jamestown, Oneonta, Utica, Watertown, and even for the Hall of Fame Stadium in Cooperstown.   	
<P>
The Rochester Red Wings, for example, claimed poverty when their league required them to upgrade Silver Stadium, which they owned.  So the state came up with $15.3 million for a new ballpark.  The Red Wings will move into Frontier Field next year.  On Long Island, the Long Island Ducks of the new Atlantic League of Professional Baseball -- who have yet to play a game -- are looking for $15 million in government funding for a new stadium.
	Supporters of taxpayer funding claim that the economy receives a huge boost from such facilities.   The story goes that government spends money on a ballpark, families spend money at the game, and this money than multiplies activity throughout the economy.  Unfortunately, such a dreamy scenario leaves out a few important details.  Government must take the money from somewhere else -- through taxes -- to build the ballpark, thereby raising costs for individuals, families and businesses, and dampening economic activity.  And, with government bureaucrats not subject to the disciplines of the marketplace, as private sector entrepreneurs are, waste in government springs eternal.  Politicians also ignore what economists call the substitution effect, which tells us that families will spend their leisure dollars one way or another, if not at a ball game, then on a movie or at a concert.  There's no net economic gain from government stadium building.  Considering the boost in taxes and government's wasteful ways, it's likely a net economic loss.
<P>
  	Even some politicians acknowledge they can't find solid economic grounds for spending on new stadiums.  John Riley, from the Monroe County Executive's office, admitted to C&K: "You would be hard pressed to find a direct economic benefit from the construction of a stadium."  In a recent interview, a top New York City official explained to us that sorting out the economic benefits of a new Yankee Stadium on Manhattan's west side would be a daunting task.	Until the 1950s and 1960s, the private sector was the source of new stadiums and it worked quite well.  Now, however, we have political sentiment and intuition, and few facts.  Officials can only say that government ballparks enhance the "quality of life" -- a rather nebulous concept for which to spend tens, if not hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars.	Dave Howard, a spokesman for the Mets, told C&K that "given the cost of doing business in New York" there's "no way" that financing a new stadium for the Mets "can be done privately."  However, after being rejected by the voters four times for new taxpayer-financed stadiums in recent years, the San Francisco Giants just received a zoning clearance from San Francisco voters in order to build a new, privately financed ballpark in the China Basin.  And the cost of doing business in San Francisco -- another high tax city -- is quite burdensome. 
<P>
Stadiums surely can be privately financed, but why would team owners and league officials take the private route when politicians are willing to pass the costs on to the taxpayer?  As the old saying goes, why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?  The answer to New York's high "cost of doing business" is downsizing government.  A good place to start is saying no to subsidizing baseball teams.  Privatizing ballparks already in government hands would be the next logical step.  It's time to put "For Sale" signs out on New York's ballparks.  Then we can all enjoy a ball game, free from the stench of corporate welfare.

<b>Testing Pataki's Mettle</b>
<p>
by Matthew Carolan and Raymond J. Keating
<p>
<i>March 25, 1996</i>
<p><br></center>
<hr width="85%">
<p><br>
<blockquote>
	The New York State budget will be late once again, missing the April 1 deadline for the twelfth year in a row.  But there is a silver lining in the budget battles of the last two years.   The debate is starting to shift in Albany, from squabbles over pork, which held up previous budgets, to discussions about the nature and size of government.	Credit the conservative instincts of Governor George Pataki for the change.  Surfing a wave of anti-Cuomo, pro-tax-cut sentiment into the Governor's Mansion in 1994, Pataki immediately sought to reverse the growth trend in state spending, and implement even deeper tax cuts than those scheduled years earlier but not delivered by Cuomo and the state legislature.
<p>
	In his first budget last year, Pataki proposed a four-year tax-cut centered around a reduction in the top personal income tax rate from 7.875% to 5.9%, as well as spending restraint not seen in New York in a half-century.  The Governor was thwarted somewhat by that silver-tongued orator Speaker Sheldon Silver and his Assembly Democrats, as well as a few Senate Republicans, who whittled down Pataki's tax rate cut to just 6.85% by 1997.  Still, combined with a modest increase in spending, only 2.3% (below the rate of inflation), last year was not a bad kickoff to the Pataki Administration, even with a late budget.
<P>
	This year the task is just as daunting.  Pataki is proposing a mere 0.4% increase in total state spending and the next phase of his tax cut takes effect.  The Governor should be commended for his budget actions.   Let's remember, though, even under the Pataki plan, the state budget still stands at a staggering $63.8 billion.  If we're serious about turning New York's economy around, the Pataki initiatives should be treated as first steps, with deeper tax cuts and budget savings needed.	Still, Pataki faces numerous structural and political obstacles.  First, there's the budget battle in Washington, which throws a monkey wrench into any budget calculations the Governor has made.  Once again,  there are the Assembly Democrats, and their supporting special-interests cabal of unions, social workers, public school bureaucrats, etc.  Expect them to ratchet up the pressure even higher when the savings from Washington, D.C. that the Governor's budget counts on fail to materialize.  They'll push harder to delay the Pataki tax cut and boost state spending.
<P>
	Given the poor track record of Senate Republicans, who failed to stand up for scheduled tax reductions each year from 1990 through 1994, the Governor may be alone in defense of his tax plan.  To his credit, Pataki consistently voted against budgets that broke tax-cut pledges as a state assemblyman and senator.  Now his mettle will be put to the test as Governor.	Some structural changes would help.  First, the Governor should unhoist himself from his own petard. Open up the budget process, even if it means devolving power.  Take the budget out of the hands of the Big 3, the Governor, Assembly Speaker and Senate Majority Leader.  Unleash the media (other than us) on the full legislature, and its pork-barrel dealings.  As the good book says, "Those who live in darkness hate the light."	
<P>
Second, turn to the state Constitution, something which naturally arouses public interest.  The Governor already has started down this path, proposing an amendment which would require that an austerity budget, equal to 90% of the prior year's appropriations, take effect automatically if the April 1 budget deadline is missed. The governor also has proposed an amendment requiring a super-majority vote in each house to raise taxes by more than $50 million a year.  But why not a super-majority to raise taxes at all?	Third, Pataki should make amends for his support of the deeply flawed debt reform measure of 1995 -- wisely rejected by the voters -- by bringing greater attention to the real problem of long-term debt.  I.e., how it has been accumulated by myriad public authorities without voter approval, how the state constitution forbids it, and how judges have been too lenient in allowing it.	
<P>
Finally, act "gubernatorial." For one thing, drop the silly squabbling with Betsy McCaughey Ross, the Lt. Governor.  Get her out publicly and prominently supporting the budget.  She is telegenic, more recognizable than Stan Lundine ever was, and she even unnerves Sheldon Silver.  This can only help the Pataki Administration gain some much-need "stature" as a harmonious unit, rather than appearing petty and disorganized.	The fortunes of New York are tied to the fortunes of George Pataki.  If he grows as a leader and tax cutter, New York stands a chance to actually prosper, something we haven't done in a very long time.
<P>

<P><br><b>
Who Would a Flat Tax Hurt in NY -- the People or Politicians?
<p></b>
by Matthew Carolan and Raymond J. Keating
<p><i>March 11,1996</i>
<p><br>
<hr width="85%">
<P><br></center>
<blockquote>
	Under the iron hand of Senator Alfonse D'Amato, New York Republicans delivered the state's March 7 primary to Senator Bob Dole, and dealt a death blow to the now defunct presidential campaign of Steve Forbes.  Along the way, New York Republican leaders hurled slurs at Forbes' central campaign issue -- a 17% flat tax to replace our current federal income tax system.	Leading up to the primary, Senator D'Amato declared: "The flat tax will be devastating for New York," citing studies that pointed to a large drop in property values, especially on Long Island, due to the loss of state and local tax and mortgage interest deductions.  Governor George Pataki reportedly said that a Forbes-style flat tax would "destroy New York's economy."  Long Island Republican Congressman Peter King also railed against the flat tax.  Following their leaders, the pack of Republican anti-flat taxers in New York grew large.	
<P>
But the real reason New York politicos oppose a federal flat tax with few deductions was spelled out by New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani on the Sunday before New York's primary.  Giuliani bemoaned the fact that the elimination of deductions for state and local income and property taxes would hurt high-tax states and localities -- i.e., New York State and New York City -- and might even increase pressure to lower state and local tax rates.  Imagine the horror, New York politicians forced to lower tax rates!	New York elected officials like the fact that the current federal tax code subsidizes their own profligacy.  A system filled with loopholes also greases the wheels for deal-making and horse trading between New York's federal representatives and others from across the nation.  New York politicians have a clear stake in the current system.  However, New York taxpayers have a real stake in reforms that will cut their taxes and boost the economy.	
<P>
Under today's tax code, resources are drained away from productive private sector ventures and into largely unproductive government undertakings.  High tax rates create disincentives for working, saving, investing, and risk taking -- the true engines of economic growth and job creation.  Indeed, New York's burdensome tax structure has kept the state's rate of job growth well below the national average for at least the past two decades.  New Yorkers would benefit from a low flat tax in many ways: New Yorkers' tax rates would be cut significantly.  For example, under the Forbes plan, the top federal-state combined income tax rate in New York would fall from about 44 percent to 24 percent.  In New York City, the rate would decline from  more than 46 percent to about 28 percent.   Overall, according to the Heritage Foundation, the average household in New York would save $1,298 annually under a 17% flat tax. Under the current tax code, returns on investment are taxed at the corporate level and the individual level.  
<P>
As called for under the Forbes flat tax, double taxation of capital gains and dividends would come to an end, thereby boosting incentives for investment and entrepreneurship -- both in short supply in New York.  More investment and risk taking translates into faster growth and more jobs.   The Forbes plan calls for an end to deductions for interest payments at the business level and no taxation of interest earned at the individual level.  The effect of these changes, increasing supply and lowering demand for loanable funds, combined with lower tax rates, would be to dramatically reduce interest rates.   Lower interest rates, increased incentives for saving and investment, and faster economic growth -- all resulting from the flat tax -- will more than offset any potential downward pressure on property values due to a loss of mortgage interest and property tax deductions.  
<P>
Indeed, one could legitimately expect a tremendous boost to New York's economy, and therefore to property values, under a flat tax. And finally, if a flat tax actually does pressure state and local officials to cut taxes, so much the better.  In high-tax New York, any means to reducing taxes is a net plus for the state's economy and the well-being of individuals, families, and businesses.	Former New York Congressman and HUD Secretary Jack Kemp was so appalled by New York GOP machine attacks on the flat tax that he finally endorsed Steve Forbes for president.    Though Forbes soon dropped out of the race, Kemp's endorsement illustrated how principle and sound economics can rise above political pandering and special interests.	New York's economy would be helped, not hindered, by the flat tax.  And now that Forbes is out of the race, Senator Dole even has uttered a few niceties about the flat tax.  Unfortunately, with Senator D'Amato and New York's special interests at Dole's side, don't expect much movement toward a true, low flat tax in the near future.

<blockquote>
"If the trumpet gives an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle?" (1 Corinthians, 14:8)	With a major victory over Mario Cuomo in 1994 and a state Democratic Party in continuing confusion, New York conservatives are understandably looking forward to November's battle for control of the State Assembly.  But are they up to the task?  Herewith, some analysis: The Conservative Party is running television ads for a Gingrich-style "Contract with New York."  The strategy is the same as it was for the national Republican Contract with America: unite all the candidates around popular policies, focusing the races on a larger vision, in this case, a statewide vision.  The vision thing always has been unfamiliar ground to the New York GOP, so conservatives must provide a clear map.	The Contract contains some excellent policy prescriptions: term limits, school vouchers, initiative and referendum, an end to affirmative action, etc.  It sets a standard for smaller government and more freedom.
<P>
	Though, from an artistic standpoint, the Contract's television ad doesn't score very high.  It features tax-dollars being flushed down a toilet.  Undoubtedly true, but a point crudely made. The Contract will serve, we hope, as a precedent.  An objective standard to which local Conservative Party chairmen can be held accountable.  Some local chairmen suffer from a curious ailment of endorsing liberal Democrats.  Just to note the most egregious cases, we've discovered four assembly Democrats endorsed by conservatives at the local level who scored at 50% or below when their voting records were ranked by the state Conservative Party -- Dov Hikind, 35%; Steven Kaufman, 45%; Ronald Tocci, 45%; and Paul Tokasz, 50%.	Democratic Congressman Mike McNulty, also endorsed by his local Conservative Party, had an American Conservative Union 1995 rating of just 21%!  
<P>
Following the laws of probability you can get a monkey to vote more conservative.  Indeed, one Republican operative we spoke with after a statewide race a few years ago, observed that some local conservative politicos were more enamored of patronage than even their GOP confreres. While the Contract might help bring these strays back into the fold, it is not devoid of problems either.	For example, the tax proposal calls for a "middle class tax cut."  Why middle-class taxes only?  Is class warfare so ingrained in the minds of average New Yorkers that even the Conservative Party has to soft-pedal its message?  It makes sense to cut taxes across the board, in order to spur investment, entrepreneurship and job creation.  To boost New York's economy, we need tax cuts that are deep and provide real relief for individuals of all income levels as well as businesses.
<p>	
There's also the issue of abortion. Not even a word about restrictions appears in the Contract.  New York Christian Coalition executive director Jeff Baran finds it curious: "Compared to the Conservative Party's platform planks, you don't see any social issues in the Contract with New York." Baran told C&K that since the election of George Pataki, he sees a real move toward economic issues and away from social issues among state conservatives, which leaves his members feeling out in the cold.  It remains hard to get them excited about green eyeshade stuff, no matter how true.	Baran has "taken a lot of heat," he says, from his own people for "broadening" his agenda to economic issues, while not seeing any action on the social issues front in return.  This is a microcosm of what's happening at the national level, where alienated evangelicals have flocked to the Buchanan campaign, with its dismal economic message. 
<P>
As for the state legislative races, how is the current crop of Republican assembly hopefuls you ask?  What crop?  The GOP is off to a very slow start finding good conservative candidates.  This worries Dusty Rhodes, of the conservative group Change-NY: "We can't work with the GOP to get something done in this state, in particular to ensure that taxes aren't increased, if they don't get the right candidates to work with."	As is the case nationally, on the brink of real victory, New York conservatives seem strangely in disarray.  They struggle to unite social and economic conservatives, where in the past this was never such a herculean task.

<a name="one"><CENTER><H3>Introduction</a></H3></CENTER>
During election campaigns, special interests attempt to push, pull, cajole, and maneuver candidates into supporting their narrow agendas.  Under such pressures and in the heat of a campaign, candidates can succumb to such narrow interests and lose sight of those policies and actions that serve all entrepreneurs and the economy best.
<p> 
 Unfortunately, small but vocal parts of the business community can be listed among these special interests.  They can be found supporting positions that may promote their own particular, short-term interests, but at the cost of business and the economy at large.
Therefore, the Small Business Survival (SBS) Foundation has undertaken an effort to educate candidates, along with the media, businesses, entrepreneurs, and citizens, as to the policies that boost entrepreneurship, investment, and economic growth.  This booklet -- "Entrepreneurs and Elections '96: A Candidate's Handbook to Critical Small Business Issues" -- will be the very cornerstone of SBS Foundation's education efforts for the upcoming year.
<P>
After reading through this booklet, candidates will gain some insights as to how to think in economic terms.  Many candidates have little trouble thinking politically, but often are guilty of leaving sound economics out of their policy platforms.  However, economics cannot and should not be left out of any campaign effort.  When politicians do forget economics, the consequences can be severe, whether on the campaign trail or upon taking elected office.
<p>
In the end, candidates need to remember that sound economics makes for sound politics, and ultimately sound governing.  In the end, sound economics dictates removing government-imposed hurdles to entrepreneurship and small business success.<P>
<hr>
<a name="two"><H3><CENTER>The Impact of Small Business and Entrepreneurs on the Economy</a></CENTER></H3>
Why should candidates be concerned about small business and entrepreneurs?  It is an important question that must be answered here, at the outset; otherwise, the rest of this publication becomes irrelevant.  (See related box on pages 8-9.)<P>
The importance of small business and entrepreneurial activity in the economy is overwhelming.  Four fundamental reasons stand out:
First, entrepreneurs are the source of dynamism and growth in any economy.  They are the risk takers without which an economy would stagnate and eventually decline.  
<p>
Entrepreneurs keep the economy vibrant and growing.  As I noted recently in The Freeman: "The critical role of the entrepreneur in the economy is to see added value where others have failed to do so -- to enhance production and/or efficiency.  That is, to fulfill the essence of Say's Law -- that supply creates demand.  In turn, one can identify numerous types of entrepreneurship.  The Schumpeterian entrepreneur, named for economist Joseph Schumpeter and his notion of 'creative destruction,' offers innovations or inventions that can transform entire industries and economies.  Other entrepreneurs offer improvements in the way particular firms perform through, perhaps, different management or production structures; while still others simply see better ways of doing things and start their own businesses.  Additional entrepreneurs are at work in the investment community.  For example, an investment banker or corporate raider might see added value through a proposed corporate merger or takeover.  Then there are the venture capitalists willing to risk their own investment dollars supporting an idea, invention, innovation, or new business."2  
<p>
Second, hundreds of thousands of individuals start up their own businesses each year.  Individuals dip into the entrepreneurial waters for a variety of reasons.  Most prominent remains the American dream of owning and succeeding with one's own enterprise -- the self-made man or woman, if you will.  Financial independence, the satisfaction of bringing a new product or service to market, and improving upon what your competitors have done, all co-mingle to play a role in stirring the entrepreneurial spirit.<P>
In addition, the bureaucracies and often perverse incentive structures at many large companies, as well as corporate restructurings and downsizings, have led, or sometimes forced, individuals to become entrepreneurs -- to start up their own small businesses.  According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 1994, some 500,000 Americans lost their jobs due to downsizing, for a total of 4.4 million in the past 15 years.
<p>
Lastly, proper public policy steps (explained in more detail throughout the remainder of this booklet) boost incentives for entrepreneurship and venture capital investment.<P>
Figure 1 traces new business incorporations from 1967 to 1994.  Incorporations had been on a fairly steady rise from 1967 through 1986 (with drops in 1970, 1974, and 1982), but steadily declined from 1987 through 1991.  The 1986 peak of 702,738 was only reached again in 1993, when incorporations hit 706,537, then rising to 741,657 in 1994.
<P>
Figure 2 shows annual percent changes in new business incorporations from 1968 to 1994.  Again, the 1987 to 1991 period is quite striking.
Figure 3 offers a broader picture of entrepreneurship.  It traces the establishment of new firms between 1983 and 1993.  Steady growth occurred from 1983 to 1987, with a meandering pattern since.  Figure 4 puts these numbers in percentage growth terms.<P>
Figure 5 offers another view of the growth in the number of U.S. businesses.  It shows the annual percentage increase in nonfarm business tax returns -- including corporations, partnerships, and proprietorships -- for 1981 to 1993.<P>
However, the true spirit of American individualism and entrepreneurship may be best captured by the "one man" business.  Between 1970 and 1991, the number of sole proprietorships filing tax returns leapt from 5.7 million to 15.2 million -- an increase of 167 percent.  The United States truly is the land of opportunity and entrepreneurship.<P>
The millions of entrepreneurs represented by these charts and numbers benefit consumers and the economy by introducing new products and services, more choices, enhanced competition, and greater efficiencies to the marketplace.  And they do all this at considerable economic peril.  The risks of starting up, investing in, and owning and operating a business run high.<P>
Third, small businesses create the bulk of new jobs.  As many large firms downsize in order to compete in the global economy, job creation falls to small business.  This has been the case for at least the past decade and a half, with the trend continuing today.<P>
According to Dun & Bradstreet's 1995 employment survey, firms with fewer than 100 employees will account for 66 percent of all new jobs created in 1995, with 50 percent of all employment gains coming in firms with fewer than 20 employees.  Firms with fewer than 500 employees will account for 84 percent of all new jobs created.<P>
Figure 6 shows the small business share of total private sector employment (1991 data latest available).  Fifty-three percent of all private-sector employees work in firms with less than 500 employees; 39 percent work in enterprises with less than 100 employees; and 20 percent in businesses of less than 20 employees.<P>
Finally, the best agenda for small business is the best agenda for the nation as a whole.  Since small business produces the bulk of new jobs; employs a majority of U.S. workers; includes in its ranks corporations, partnerships, and sole proprietorships; and remains a key source of dynamism and innovation in the economy; then what's good for small business and the entrepreneur is good for the nation.  The following pages spell out the true small business agenda.<P>
<hr>
<a name="three">
<H3><CENTER>A Pro-Entrepreneur Tax System</a></CENTER></H3>
There is no greater burden faced by entrepreneurs than taxation.  A recent Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC) poll found that small business owners identify the IRS by far as the most burdensome federal government agency.  <P>
While taxes always play a critical part in every election, they promise to be particularly important in 1996.  A complete reform of our tax system is now under serious consideration in our nation's capital.  Tax overhaul promises to become a prominent aspect of every major political race in America -- including all House and Senate contests and especially the race for the White House.  Overhauling our current tax system and lowering the tax burden on businesses and individuals will boost economic growth and opportunity -- a positive message transcending all income levels.<P>
In an effort to help clarify the tax overhaul debate now upon us, SBS Foundation published a booklet in June 1995 entitled "The Great Tax Debate: Making Sense of Competing Tax Plans."  The major tax reform proposals were evaluated according to eight criteria of sound taxation, summarized as follows:<ul><P>
<li> Low Flat Tax Rate to Promote Economic Growth - the lower and more proportional, or flatter, the tax rate system the better.  
<li> No Taxation of Capital - taxing returns on investment and savings makes absolutely no economic sense.  
<li> Inflation Factor - the detrimental effects of inflation should be factored into any tax system's design. No additional incentive for the monetary authority to inflate should be provided by the tax system.  
<li> Clarity - the clearer the tax system the better.  The best tax system makes clear how much is owed, who is paying, and when the tax is being paid.  
<li> Simplicity - tax payments should be made as easy and as simple as possible for the taxpayer without any loss of clarity.  
<li> Limited Bureaucracy and Intrusiveness - the fewer tax collectors and the more limited their powers the better.
<li> Minimize Incentives for Tax Avoidance - taxes should be low enough so as to not provide significant incentives for avoidance.  
<li> No Additional Boost to Government Spending - a tax system's design should not make it any easier for government to increase expenditures. </ul><p>
Based on these eight principles, a sound tax system -- one which allows entrepreneurs to flourish and the economy to grow -- can be established.  The following proposals for a pro-entrepreneur tax system are broken into two sections -- the first being necessary reforms under our current federal tax structure, while the second outlines ideas for completely overhauling the tax system. 
<P>
<hr>
<H3><CENTER><a name="four">I. Immediate Reforms</a></CENTER></H3>
<ul><li><b> Capital Gains Taxes.</b>  At the time of this writing, Congress was moving to cut the capital gains tax by instituting a 50-percent exclusion from taxation for individuals -- lowering the top rate from 28 percent to 19.8 percent -- as well as lowering the corporate rate to 28 percent.  If passed, these are positive steps that would help the U.S. economy regain ground lost in terms of stifled entrepreneurship after the capital gains tax was increased by 40 percent under the 1986 Tax Reform Act.  Figures 1 through 5 reflect the drop off in entrepreneurial activity after the 1986 capital gains tax hike.  However, while moving in the right direction, this capital gains tax cut remains inadequate.<P>
In order to boost incentives for investment and risk taking -- the engines of economic growth -- the capital gains tax should be eliminated.  Considering the high risks involved with starting up and expanding a business, eliminating the capital gains tax is perhaps the most pro-entrepreneur tax initiative a candidate or elected official can support.  By removing the considerable hurdle of capital gains taxation, high risks can be offset by at least the opportunity for significant returns.  Without such an opportunity, investment, entrepreneurship, economic growth, and job creation suffer.<P>
At minimum, a candidate should support indexation of capital gains for inflation.  Taxing illusory gains due to inflation is unfair and economically counter-productive.  Indeed, the real capital gains tax rate jumps considerably when inflation is factored into the equation.  In fact, in many instances, taxes can be paid on an inflation-adjusted capital loss.  Can there be any doubt as to the detrimental effects of a non-indexed capital gains tax?<P>
Of course, supporting capital gains tax reduction often opens candidates up to bankrupt, class-warfare criticisms.  The answers to such levies are simple and straightforward.<P><ul>
<li>Enhanced incentives for investment and entrepreneurship boost economic growth and job creation.
<li>Many of our international competitors tax capital gains far more lightly than does the United States.  For example, Germany, Hong Kong and the Netherlands do not tax long-term capital gains at all.  Even nations with higher nominal capital gains rates than the U.S. -- like Australia and the United Kingdom -- index gains for inflation, thereby effectively having lower real capital gains tax rates.
<li>Investors and entrepreneurs spend and invest funds far more efficiently than do government bureaucrats.
<li>The direct tax benefits of capital gains tax reduction are claimed by individuals across the income spectrum.  For example, the latest figures provided by Investor's Business Daily (November 20, 1995) show that in 1993, 84 percent of income earners claiming capital gains had total incomes of less than $100,000.  Incomes of less than $50,000 laid claim to 57 percent of all returns claiming capital gains.  <P></ul>
Critics counter that only 29.7 percent of capital gains income fell to earners with total incomes of less than $100,000, with the rest going to the "rich."  Putting aside the fact that the "rich" put their money to better use than government bureaucrats, one has to generally question this "rich" label.  After all, if one extracts capital gains from total income to gain a better understanding of the standard income levels of individuals, then over 52 percent of capital gains income were claimed by income earners with less than $100,000 in non-capital-gains income.<P>
The case for eliminating the capital gains tax stands tallest when one understands and argues that growth will be enhanced, incomes increased, and job creation boosted as a result.  Economic growth is a strong campaign message.<P>
<li> <STRONG>Estate Taxes.</STRONG>  At the time this booklet was being written, Congress agreed to raise the exemption under the estate tax from $600,000 to $750,000, and for certain "family-owned" businesses, the first $1 million in value would be exempt and a 40-percent tax exclusion applied to the $1 million to $2.5 million value range.  Once again, if agreed to by President Clinton, these initiatives are positive but insufficient.<P>
Unfortunately, 60 percent of family-owned businesses fail to survive to a second generation, with 90 percent never seeing a third.  The estate tax plays a significant role in the demise of family businesses.  In effect, the estate tax amounts to a hostile takeover of businesses and assets by the government -- with a top rate of 55 percent, plus another 5 percent for very large estates.  <P>
Of course, no economic reason can be found to justify estate and inheritance taxes.  The unfairness of individuals paying taxes their entire lives only to have have their assets raided by the government at death is manifest.  Such levies are based solely on class warfare impulses and government's incessant drive to root out more and more revenues.  Of course, in the meantime, the estate tax deprives businesses of precious capital and creates disincentives for investing in and expanding family businesses.
<P>
Estate taxes generate a mere one percent of government revenues with most of that wiped out by litigation and administrative costs.  This is a high price to pay for the destruction of thousands of businesses and jobs each year.<P>
Estate and inheritance taxes make absolutely no economic sense whatsoever, and should be eliminated. <P>
<li> <STRONG>The Bush and Clinton Tax Increases.</STRONG>  The tax increases of both the Bush and Clinton administrations diverted resources away from productive private-sector ventures and made working, saving, investing, and risk taking more costly.  Indeed, an April/May 1994 Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC) survey of 500 small businesses found that a total of 69 percent of respondents declared that the Clinton tax hikes forced them to either raise prices, postpone expansion, terminate at least one employee, or some combination of these actions.  <P>
The Bush and Clinton tax increases should be rolled back.  Of particular importance is reducing income tax rates to their former levels -- for example, dropping the top individual rate back to 28 percent from its current level of 39.6 percent.<P>
<li> <STRONG>Constitutional Protections for Taxpayers. </STRONG> Constitutional protections are needed for the American taxpayer.  Ever increasing taxes destroy the spirit of entrepreneurship, weigh down the economy, and infringe upon liberty.  A "Taxpayer Protection Constitutional Amendment" would do the following: <P>
Ban retroactive tax increases.  President Clinton's 1993 tax increase was made retroactive to the beginning of that year -- before he even took office.  Individuals, entrepreneurs, and businesses need some semblance of stability when it comes to taxation for their own planning purposes.  In contrast, retroactive tax hikes create significant instability.  The unfairness and economically destructive nature of retroactive tax increases is clear.  <P>
Require a two-thirds super-majority vote in both houses of Congress in order to increase current taxes and fees, or to impose new ones.  As Chief Justice John Marshall warned: "The power to tax involves the power to destroy."  Perhaps no greater truth was ever uttered regarding the impact of taxation.  
The Constitution protects us from governmental abuses.  The Founding Fathers never envisioned government growing to the massive level it has today; nor the current burdensome levels of taxation.  Placing a super-majority vote requirement on Congress in order to raise taxes not only makes for sound economics, but fits neatly into the Constitution's purpose of limiting governmental powers.<P>
<li> <STRONG>Independent Contractors. </STRONG> The question of who is or is not classified by the IRS as an independent contractor has long concerned small businesses and the self-employed.  The IRS offers a 20-point criteria which is vague and complex.  <P>
Reclassifications by the IRS are standard and costly.  For example, according to SBS Foundation President Karen Kerrigan in a recent column in the American City Business Journals, "[T]he IRS has reclassified 439,000 independent workers since the mid 1980s, resulting in the collection of $678 million in taxes and fines."<P>
The IRS's criteria for determining who is an independent contractor must be clarified and simplified.  For example, recent legislation by Rep. Jon Christensen (R-Neb.) offered a fairly straightforward three-part test requiring that an independent contractor demonstrate independence, investment in his business, and a written agreement between parties. </ul><P>
<hr>
<H3><CENTER><a name="five">II. Tax Overhaul.</a></CENTER></H3>
As already noted, the complete overhaul of the U.S. tax system is now under serious consideration, and without a doubt, will play a significant part in the 1996 political debates.  In "The Great Tax Debate," the SBS Foundation scored and ranked the various tax overhaul plans.  <P>
According to our eight criteria for a sound tax system, the flat tax scored highest followed closely by a national retail sales tax, with a value-added tax (VAT), the consumed-income tax, and our current system trailing well behind.  Thankfully, the two systems ranked best in "The Great Tax Debate" -- the flat tax and a national retail sales tax -- currently are receiving extensive consideration and examination by tax experts, policy makers, and elected officials.<P>
Though the SBS Foundation has provided a complete review of the various tax overhaul proposals in "The Great Tax Debate," the importance of this issue for the 1996 elections dictates that we summarize here how the flat tax and national retail sales tax measure up to our eight criteria for sound taxation.<P>
<STRONG>THE FLAT TAX </STRONG><ul><P>
<li><STRONG> Low Flat Tax Rate to Promote Economic Growth.</STRONG>  Generally under consideration right now is a flat tax that actually is a two-rate tax system -- no tax on income up to a certain level and then a flat rate on all income earned above that level.  The rate most often cited by reformers is 17 percent.  A flat tax of 17 percent -- preferably less -- would greatly reduce tax-based disincentives for working and risk taking.
<li><STRONG> No Taxation of Capital.</STRONG>  The flat tax would not tax earnings from investment and saving at all -- no taxation of capital gains, dividends, or interest <p><br>

     Every  small businessperson knows that a <i>Contract</i> is more than a promise.  It is an
agreement initiated by faith, but
enforced by law.  Each party can proceed  with confidence that the terms of the <i>Contract</i>
will be carried through, or the
negligent party will be forced to account for his or her actions.<p>

     That is why small businesses should be excited about the <i>Contract With America</i>.  Not
only does the <i>Contract</i>
represent a leap forward for small business interests, but it also represents a new thinking in
Washington.<p>

     The Republicans who signed the <i>Contract</i>  signed a business deal with the American
people.  In exchange for the
voters' support at the polls, we pledged to carry forth the terms of the <i>Contract</i>.  The
voters upheld their end of the bargain,
and now it is our turn.<p>

     In this pamphlet you will find an analysis of the positive impact the <i>Contract</i> will have
on small businesses.  By
the end of the first 100 days, the House of Representatives will have brought up and voted on
bills to lower taxes, reduce
regulation, reduce federal spending, provide real incentives for growth and reform the rules of
the House to provide
accountability.  Members of Congress will act in a more business-like way ourselves, and will
provide necessary relief for
the job-creating small businesses of our country.<p>



     And the <i>Contract</i> is only the beginning.  The new Republican Leadership in Congress
has pledged to reverse the big government trends of the last 40 years, and I am committed to the
goal.  As Chairman of the Small Business Survival Caucus, you can count on me to make sure
your voice as an entrepreneur is heard.<p>

<a name="intro"><b>THE CONTRACT WITH AMERICA AND SMALL BUSINESS</a></b><br>
<a href="#contents"><font size="-1">(contents)</a></font><br></center>     <br>

     The first 100 days of the 104th Congress will indeed be busy on Capitol Hill.  The
Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives made a promise to the American people, if
elected to majority status.  They signed a "<i>Contract</i>" stating they would bring to the floor
of the House a series of ten bills representing a stark ideological alternative to the tax, regulate,
waste and spend Washington of the "old regime."<p>
      The Republicans got their majority wish, and now hundreds of thousands of small businesses
and entrepreneurs are curious about <i>The Contract With America</i> and how the specific
legislation will impact their livelihood.<p>
      The <i>Contract: A Small Business Guide to the First 100 Days of the New
Congress</i>, details the legislative initiatives within the <i>Contract</i>.  From tax cuts to
regulatory relief, the guide examines components of the <i>Contract</i>, specifically targeting
issues  of concern to small businesses. Because owners of smaller enterprises are
overwhelmingly concerned about fiscal  accountability in government, elements of the
<i>Contract</i> addressing those issues are also examined.<p>

     The last section of the guide to the <i>Contract</i> features each of the tens bills in the
<i>Contract With America</i>.  The Small Business Survival Committee strongly recommends
that you contact the Republican Conference at (202)-225-5107 if you have questions regarding
points in the <i>Contract</i> not addressed in this publication. The purpose of this publication is
not to diminish the importance of other <i>Contract</i>  points, but to highlight important policy
changes  that will directly impact your business and the economy.<p>

     Most delightfully, on the first day of the 104th Congress (January 4, 1995), the Republican
majority voted on and passed legislation forcing Congress to live under the same laws as every
other American and business.  Hopefully this measure will expedite action by the Congress to
roll back the burdensome regulations and laws that are impeding economic growth, and
unnecessarily costing small businesses billions in wasted time and money.  The Small Business
Survival Committee remains hopeful that the second 100 days of Congress will include a
"rollback process" to abolish illogical, outdated and excessive laws.<p>

     The <i>Contract</i>, by our analysis, is a good start at lifting government-imposed burdens
that are unnecessarily suffocating the backbone of the American economy -- small business.<p>

 A Check List<br><a href="#contents"><font size="-1">(contents)</a></font><p>
</center>
On January 4, 1995, the first day of the 104th Congress, the Republican majority will
immediately pass the following major reforms:*<p> 
(If you are following <i>The Contract With America</i> and want to keep your own "score
card" we have provided a box next to each initiative, to check off each item  as it is passed by
Congress.  <b>All eight items below  have been passed</b>.)<p>
<ul>
<li><i>First</i>, require all laws that apply to the rest of the country also apply equally to the
Congress;<br>
<li><i>Second</i>, select a major, independent auditing firm to conduct a comprehensive audit
of Congress for waste, fraud or abuse;<br> 
<li><i>Third</i>, cut the number of House committees, and cut committee staff by
one-third;<br>
<li><i>Fourth</i>, limit the terms of all committee chairs;<br>
<li><i>Fifth</i>, ban the casting of proxy votes in committee;<br>
<li><i>Sixth</i>, require committee meetings to be open to the public;<br>
<li><i>Seventh</i>, require a three-fifths majority to pass a tax increase;<br>
<li><i>Eighth</i>, guarantee an honest accounting of our Federal Budget by implementing
zero baseline budgeting.<p>
</ul>     <p>
 
<b>Congress Not To Be "Above the Law"</b>
<p>
     <b><i>First</b></i> -- Congress passes many laws that small businesses must abide by, while exempting
itself from these very same rules and regulations.  Beyond the issue of Congress placing itself
above the law, members of Congress do not personally experience the burdensome nature of such
unrealistic rules and regulations.  Making Congress live by the laws they pass may entirely
change the nature and number of laws it enacts.  Perhaps when Congress     begins running         
its offices and committees  under the same        rules as small         businesses, we  may detect a
movement to repeal those that are particularly burdensome.<p>
<blockquote><i>"Regulators found 15 would-be violations in the office.  Among these hazards were a 4-inch
tear in the carpet beneath my desk, and file cabinet drawers that could be opened two at a time,
creating a potential hazard not identified with clearly displayed warning signs.  If I were a
private-sector employer rather than a member of Congress, I would have been fined
$1,500.</i><br>

he requested of his Capitol Hill office.<br>
<i>Professional Roofing Magazine</i> 8/94
</blockquote>
<p>
<br>
 <b>Congress to be Audited for Efficiency,
and To Run Leaner</b><p>
     
<b><i>Second and Third</i></b> -- Congress has a sloppy reputation for running its own
institution.  Scandals, slush funds, and secret meetings seem to abound on Capitol Hill.  Items
two and three on Congress' first day list focus on cleaning up Congress, while streamlining its
bureaucracy.<p>

The financial workings within the Congress will be audited by an outside firm to determine if accounting                     procedures and other financial aspects of managing Congress meet the same rigorous standards employed by the private sector.<p> 
<blockquote>
<i>We're talking about a small army: 7800 people in the House and 4000 in the Senate, a total of

cetera, runs to about <b>a billon and a half dollars a year</b>.</i><br>
<b>Martin Gross</b><br>
<i>The Government Racket, Washington Waste A to Z</i>
</blockquote>
<p>
     Doing their part to stop wasteful spending on  House operations, the committee staffs will be
cut by one-third with a real reduction in the number of committees and subcommittees. 
Committee jurisdictions will be realigned  to reduce duplication, while promoting efficiency.  
Like small businesses, Congress will have to do the same through reorganization, fewer staff,
and a more targeted agenda.<p> 
 
<b>Committees More Open and Accountable</b>
<p>
      <b><i>Fourth, Fifth and Sixth</i></b> -- Committee Chairmanship means POWER in Congress. 
The <i>Contract</i> calls for a vote to limit the number of terms a Member can serve as head of
a committee, limiting the possibility for corruption and non-accountability, while bringing  fresh
leadership to the position.<p>

     Within the committees and subcommittees themselves, the rules will be changed so Members
cannot cast ballots by proxy (ghost) voting.<p>

     The important work that takes place within the committee will be required to be open to the
public -- no more closed door meetings while Members of Congress secretly plot to raise our
taxes or their salaries.  All media will have equal access to meetings.  Committee and
subcommittee meetings may only be closed if approved by a majority of the total committee
membership, and only in cases involving national security, law enforcement information and
personal privacy. <p>
 
<b>Real Budgets and Protecting Taxpayers</b>
<P>

     <b><i>Seventh and Eighth</i></b> -- The 1993 tax increase passed by just one vote in the United
States House of Representatives and Senate -- a one vote margin gave the American people and
small businesses the biggest tax increase in history.  The <i>Contract</i> proposes that a
three-fifths "supermajority" be instituted to pass future tax increases.<p>

     When reauthorizing government programs, the government doesn't start with zero as its
baseline -- it  begins with last year's spending levels, pads them with add-ons, and adjusts those numbers for inflation.<p>
                               
<blockquote><i>Only in Washington can people engage in Orwellian Newspeak and get away with it.  A

<i>Fix the U.S. Budget!</i>, <i>Urgings of an "Abominable No-Man"</i><p>
</blockquote>
     The <i>Contract</i> guarantees truth-in-budgeting. Increases will not ever be counted as
"cuts."  A spending cut will be a real cut.             <p>

<blockquote><i>A balanced budget/tax limitation amendment and a legislative line-item veto to restore fiscal
responsibility    to an out-of-control Congress, requiring them to live under the same budget
restraints as families and businesses</i>.    -- <b><i>Contract</i> With America</b><p>
</blockquote>

     Resoundingly, the message of the November 1994 elections was about limiting the size and
scope of the government's role in the lives of Americans and businesses.  Particularly, Americans
are concerned about  national leaders not addressing the serious issue of the national debt, and
the political establishment mentality  that believes government has unlimited power to go after
taxpayer dollars to fund wasteful programs.  <i>The Fiscal Responsibility Act</i> proposes real reforms
when it comes  to managing our nation's finances, and limits the tax and spending impulses of
big government supporters.                                   <p>

In a post-election poll commissioned by the Small Business Survival Committee, the number one response given by small business owners when asked what the most critical issue is for Congress and President Clinton, was "cut government spending."   Controlling spending is the primary means to rein in the power of meddling bureaucrats, and
bring fiscal sanity back to Washington.   <p>

<blockquote><i>"I place economy among the first and most important virtues, and public debt as the greatest
of dangers... If we can prevent the government from wasting the labors of the people under the
pretense of caring for them, they will be happy."</i><br> <b>--Thomas Jefferson</b><p>
</blockquote>
<b>Ballanced Budget Amendment/Tax Limitation Amendment</b><p>
The majority of American families, individuals and small businesses balance their budgets --
often times struggling to make ends meet.  Small businesses --many operating on razor-thin
margins -- demand  that Congress be held similarly accountable, and spend hard-earned tax
dollars as if they were their own.<p>

     Unfortunately, the nation's $4.6 trillion debt and $14.4 trillion in unfunded liabilities is a true
testament to the failure of our national leaders in this regard.  And, while billions are wasted on
government programs which have  proven to be a failure (or simply fail to go away) taxpayer
"contributions" have gone up, up, and up.  The United States federal government has not
balanced its budget or ended the year in a surplus since 1969.<p>

     The U. S. Constitution has  been amended twenty-seven times, and the <i>Contract</i>
proposes it be amended again -- this time with a balanced budget amendment (BBA).
Specifically, the <i>Fiscal Responsibility Act</i> requires that total outlays for each fiscal year
not outstrip total receipts for the year.  The   BBA will go into effect in fiscal year 2002, or the
second fiscal year after it is ratified by the states, whichever is later.<p>

     The <i>Contract</i> BBA requires that the President propose, and the Congress deliver, a
yearly balanced-budget.  In the House and in the Senate three-fifths of the whole of each
chamber can vote to incur a deficit.  In cases of national security  and war, the balanced-budget
requirement  can be waived through the adoption of a  joint resolution by a majority of the
total membership of both the House and the Senate.  The President must also sign the
resolution.<p> 
      Tax increases must be approved by a three-fifths majority in each house -- more difficult to
achieve than a simple majority, to dig deeper into our pockets.<p>

     Most Americans know that the underlying problem with our country's messy fiscal affairs is
that Congress spends too much -- not that it taxes too little.  The balanced budget amendment,
joined with the tax-limitation provision, will indeed make our elected officials more accountable
to taxpayers.  The combined force of the two will ensure that Congress looks to spending cuts
first before raising the taxes of small business and all Americans.             <p>
     
<b>Line-Item Veto</b><p>
     Hidden within every appropriations bill is billions of dollars worth of pork barrel projects and
use-less government programs that only benefit narrow special interests.  Given the line-item
veto, the president would have authority  to strike these wasteful spending provisions in bills
passed by Congress.<p>

     The <i>Act</i> gives the president a permanent line-item veto to provide a check on the
extravagance of the Congress. Once the president strikes these items, the  cuts would  become
immediately effective, unless rejected by the Congress on an up-or-down vote. A rejection of the
cuts can be vetoed by the president, and a two-thirds vote by the Congress is needed to overturn
the veto. <p>

<blockquote><i>A $500 per child tax credit, begin repeal of the marriage tax penalty, and creation of
American Dream Savings      Accounts to provide middle class tax relief.  -- <b><i>Contract</i>
With America</b></i>
</blockquote>
<p>
The <i>Contract</i> begins to chip away at the federal tax burden on families, while encouraging future savings by all individual.  <i>The American Dream Restoration Act</i> gives recognition to the fact that families and individuals know how to use their hard-earned dollars more productively than bureaucrats and politicians in Washington. <p> 
<blockquote><i>The average American family head will be forced to do 20 years' labor to pay taxes in his or
her lifetime</i><br>
<b>--James Bovard</b><br>
<i>Lost Rights</i><p>
</blockquote>
<b> $500 Per-Child Family Tax Credit</b><p>
More money in the hands of consumers and the productive economy is good for small
businesses and economic growth.  Some Washington "experts" dismiss the impact of tax relief
for families.  The real experts -- American families (many of whom own a small business) spend
more on taxes than food, shelter and clothing combined.<p>

Benefitting about 50 million families, the $500 per-child tax credit becomes effective in 1996. 
All families with incomes up to $200,000 are eligible.<p>

<b>Anti-Marriage Bias Reformed</b><p>

The 1993 tax package had the unfortunate impact of imposing higher taxes on married
couples than they would pay if single.  The Act begins to erase the bias toward married couples
by reforming the tax code. The proposal calls for up to $2 billion dollars in relief.<p>
     
<b>The American Dream Savings Account</b><p>

The U.S. tax code needs to encourage savings in America -- increased savings provides more
capital for investment in small businesses and the future of America.  The Act permits
individuals to contribute up to $2,000 into a special savings account.  An individual pays taxes
on the amount contributed, but not on amounts withdrawn, when utilized for:<p>
<ul>
<li>Post-secondary educational expenses for a spouse, child or the account holder.
<li>Medical costs, including the purchase of long term care insurance.
<li>Retirement income.
<li>A first-time home purchase.

<p>
     Ask American small business what most threatens their survival, and the likely response is
either taxes, or regulations, or both. The U.S. government,  whose job it is to protect and preserve America's free enterprise system, has become a foe of the private-sector.

</blockquote>
    <i> The Job Creation and Wage Enhancement Act</i> addresses two main areas --  taxes and
regulations -- where the combined burden  of both is slowly strangling productive entrepreneurial
activity.<p>
<b>Small Business Incentives</b><p>
Small business, and the entrepreneurial spirit that drives America, continues to be a constant
in America's economy -- past, present and future.  As corporations continue to downsize, and
more men and women in their productive earning years are forced to "retire," many of these
experienced workers are starting a business.<p>

The number of home-based businesses has sky-rocketed. The technological revolution has
totally changed the way America does business.  Nearly 40 million Americans now work in their
homes.  Because small business and entrepreneurs are the backbone of the American economy,
the <i>Contract</i> calls for specifics to "prime the pump" for small business growth.<p>

<i>     The Act:</i>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Clarifies the deduction for home-offices: where the office is essential to the user's
business, taxpayers who use their office on an exclusive and regular basis, and perform tasks in
the office that cannot be fulfilled elsewhere, will qualify for the deduction.<p>
<li>Expensing:  Small businesses would be able to deduct the first $25,000 invested in
equipment and inventory. <p>
<li>The Estate Tax Exemption:  increased from $600,000 to $750,000 to help small
businesses pass on a family-owned enterprise to the next generation.        <p>
</ul>
<b>Capital Gains Tax Cut</b><p>
Venture capital, whether raised from one's family and friends, or from professional investors,
remains a critical source of funding for entrepreneurial enterprises. <p>

     The <i>Contract</i> proposes a reduction in the capital gains tax rate from 28 percent to 19.8
percent by  providing for a    50-percent exclusion on capital gains income, and indexing the rate for    
inflation.              <p>
<blockquote>
<i>Combined with indexation, reducing the top capital gains tax rate to 19.8 percent could be the
most pro-growth step taken by the new Congress ... encouragement for private-sector investment
in small business needs to be enhanced.</i><br>
<b>--Ray Keating</b><br>
Economics Advisor, Small Business Survival Committee<br>
<i>Small Business Tax Watch 1995</i><p>
</blockquote>
     Opponents of the capital gains tax cut contend it is a tax break for the wealthy. Based on 1992
tax returns however, 56 percent of returns claiming capital gains were from incomes of $50,000
or less (including the gain.)<p>

     In order to undertake and/or expand a small business, one needs capital.  Without adequate
capital, new ideas and businesses either never  make it to the marketplace or they die a premature
death.  The capital gains tax cut would greatly strengthen incentives for investment and
entrepreneurship.<p>

<center>
<b>"GET GOVERNMENT OFF OUR BACKS" MAKING REGULATORS  ACCOUNTABLE<p></b>
</center>
     The impact of excessive government regulation on small businesses, individuals and the U.S.
economy is staggering. Respected           sources place        the yearly               regulatory          burden on the      
economy as high             as $400--$500 billion.           <p>

<b>--William Laffer III</b>, Heritage Foundation<br>
<i>How Regulation is Destroying American Jobs,</i> February 1993<br>
</blockquote>
<p>
    Regulations <b>and</b> regulators are out of control.  In addition to the fact that there are
simply too many, regulators are not required to weigh the cost of proposed regulations. What is
usually measured is simply the utopian benefits.<p>

     The <i>Act</i> proposes a common-sense approach to the regulatory process including:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b> Cost-Benefit Analysis</b>:      A stringent requirement that regulatory agencies provide the
true economic and compliance costs of proposed regulations.  How much more will consumers
pay, how many jobs will be impacted, will the proposed regulation retard or lower wages, and is
small business growth jeopardized?<br>
<li><b>Risk Assessment:</b>   Federal agencies would
be required to assess the risk to human health and safety of each newly proposed regulation.<br>
<li><b>Peer  Review</b>:  An independent peer review panel would be established in each of
the agencies to accredit the assessment.  The most credible and best available scientific data
would be required.<br>
<li><b>Regulatory Budget</b>:  The bill requires that federal agencies issue an annual
summary to the American people forecasting the compliance cost of all regulations on the private
sector.  The projected cost will be capped below its present level, forcing agencies to become
more cost-conscious of the national regulatory burden,  slowing the tidal wave of new
regulations. <br>
<li><b>Paperwork Reduction Act and Regulatory Flexibility Act Strengthened:</b>  The
federal government would be required to reduce the annual paperwork burden on Americans by 5
percent annually.  The "Reg. Flex Act"--  a law already on the books to protect small businesses
from burdensome regulations, would be subjected to judicial review, meaning  that small
businesses can sue the government to enforce the law.<br>
<li><b>Regulatory Impact Analysis:</b>  Federal agencies would be required to complete a
full evaluation and appraisal in the drafting phase of a major rule (affecting more than 100 people
or costing more than $1 million.)  In addition to determining whether the proposed rule concurs or perhaps clashes with current law, the analysis will include cost-effectiveness, persons impacted, implementation cost, and other specific criteria.  Real justification would accompany new regulations.<br>
<li><b>"Citizens' Bill of Rights:"</b>  The  power of federal regulators              has increased       
   steadily over            the years with          many                    businesses                          fearing an 
                     investigation                  and/or                   inspection by              a federal agency.     
     The bill would                     require that federal inspectors read businesses and individuals
their rights when faced with a complaint for an infraction.  Under the "Bill of Rights" an
individual can refuse a warrantless search, be present at the time of inspection  and, among other
rights, be reimbursed for excessive  damages.<p>

</blockquote>
<li><b>Private Property Rights:</b>  The Environmental Protection Agency, acting under such
laws as the Endangered Species Act has eroded our constitutionally protected  private
property rights.  The Act compensates property owners for the fair market value of their property
(up to 10 percent) for any reduction in the value of the property caused by federal government
law.<br> 
<li><b>Taxpayer Debt Buydown: </b>The Act creates a mechanism for taxpayers to designate
up to 10 percent of their tax
liability to help pay off the national debt.  The Congress would be required to cut spending by the
amount requested by taxpayers in the "debt buydown."<br>   
<li><b>Unfunded Mandates:</b>  How much more do you pay in state or local taxes due to
mandates imposed on local governments from Washington?  Unfunded mandates cause state and
local governments to raise taxes and strip away their ability to provide good, traditional local
services.  The <i>Act</i> requires that the federal government determine the costs of present
unfunded mandates, and begins to ease this burdenon states and localities by requiring a
reduction in those levels.<p>

<i>"Loser pays" laws, reasonable limits on punitive damages and reform of product liability laws
to stem the endless tide of litigation.</i><br>
<b>-- <i>Contract</i> With America</b>
</blockquote>
<p>
While everyone is harmed by the abuse of our civil justice system (except, perhaps, the lawyers) 
small businesses are particularly hard hit.  A small business owner in any number of fields or
ventures can be put out of business overnight by becoming the target of even a questionable legal
claim.  Logic is thrown out the window in tort law.  It seems that if your business involves any
risk (which inherently it does) it's not a matter of when "it" will happen, but how much "it" will
cost.<p>
The <i>Contract</i> </i>begins to clean up the legal system  by providing a check on the
frivolous lawsuits and incredible settlements awarded by juries.<p>

<blockquote>
"Those who set the trends in law, just as tose who set the trends in government, are seeking zero
risks . . . The only way to accomplish zero risk is to develop zero products . . . At some point
reason and balance must be restored."<br>
<b>Larry Burkett</b><br>
<i> What Ever Happened To The American Dream</i><p>
</blockquote>

Elements of the <i>Act</i> that will help stem the tide of the litigation explosion include:<p>

<ul>
<li><b>Loser-Pays Rule:</b>  To discourage the pursuit of weak law suits, the <i>Contract</i>
proposes that the losing party in the law suit pay the attorney's fees of the winner. The amount,
however  is limited to the total cost of the loser's own legal fees.  The rule only applies to cases
in federal courts, but the states are encouraged to adopt the same kind of rules.   The rule
promotes settlement as opposed to litigation by requiring that claimants notify the other party
prior to filing of the suit.  This step should open the doors of communication prior to going to
court, thus allowing more conflicts to be settled informally rather than through expensive,
lengthy litigation.<p>

<li><b>Product Liability Reform: </b> The <i>Contract</i> legislation creates a nationwide
uniform product liability law for punitive damages, joint and several liability, and fault-based
liability for product sellers.  Currently, business  must deal with 50 different state laws on top of
federal law.  The bill requires that "clear and convincing evidence" be established by claimants to
prove harm was caused by malicious conduct.  If harm is proved, punitive damages  are restricted
to three times the actual harm.<p>
     
Joint liability for noneconomic injuries is abolished under the Act.  Defendants are also only
liable for their own share of the wrong.  This aspect of the <i>Contract</i> addresses the
"deep-pockets" issue.   Businesses that only sell products will also be protected.  Product sellers
will be liable only for the wrong generated by their own negligence.  Sellers would be held liable
for product errors when manufacturers lack funds for the settlement or can't be brought to
court.<p>

<li><b>Prior Notice: </b> Written notice must be given to the defendant at least thirty days
before a plaintiff can bring suit.  The notice must include specifics of the suit and what the
plaintiff is seeking in damages.<p>

<li><b>Checklist for Congress: </b>The laws created by Congress often create years of
expensive litigation.  Legislation that is drafted in a vacuum, or when Congress fails to deal with
the all-important specifics,  often end up in the courts and usually the Supreme Court. 
Committees drafting legislation will be given a check list of items (e.g.: will the law be
retroactive and will the law apply to the government) to help minimize the possibility of court
action.<p>

<li><b>Strike Suits:</b> The proliferation of class-action shareholder law suits is hitting small
and medium-size growth companies very hard. In this type of suit  attorneys sue the company
because the stock purchases did not "live up to expectations."  These claims are particularly
hurtful to job creation and economic growth.  The Act clamps down on attorneys and stock
buyers who abuse the system by making a full-time racket out of shareholder class-action suits. 
In addition to other meaningful reforms, claimants must prove that they were intentionally
misinformed.<p>

<li><b>Honesty in Evidence and Lawyer Accountability:  </b>So-called experts are used daily
in the courts to justify often absurd claims.  In the federal courts the Act would disallow
testimony based on "junk-science,"  and would not allow experts to receive contingency fees (the
judge may, however, waive this in some cases.)  The Act will encourage the states to require that
attorneys justify contingency fees.  Laws that penalize attorneys for willfully adding to the cost
of litigations will  be strengthened.<p>

</center>
 The new Congress, and the agenda devised in <i>The Contract With America</i>, will certainly
make 1995 the "Year of Small Business."  Indeed, policy and legislative decisions for this year
will have a renewed focus on those segments of society representing the  backbone, and the
foundation, of American society and the economy -- small business tops the list.<p>

Powerful special interests, however, will fight to keep this agenda from passing Congress. 
Opponents of limited government will try to persuade the American people that wholesale chaos
will erupt if sizeable spending cuts are enacted, or if the Congress begins to strip away some of
the burdensome regulation that is choking free enterprise.     The Small Business Survival
Committee encourages you to contact your United States Representative and Senators and ask
them to be bold, and pass the components of <i>The Contract With America</i> outlined in this
pamphlet.  You can reach them at:<p>

<p>
     ...Thereafter, within the first 100 days of the 104th Congress, we shall bring to the House
Floor the following bills, each to be given full and open debate, each to be given a clear and fair
vote and each to be immediately available this day for public inspection and scrutiny.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>The Fiscal Responsibility Act: </b> A balanced budget/tax limitation amendment and a
legislative line-item veto to restore fiscal responsibility to an out-of-control Congress, requiring
them to live under the same budget constraints as families and businesses.<p>
<li><b>The Taking Back Our Streets Act:  </b>An anti-crime package including stronger
truth-in-sentencing, "good faith" exclusionary rule exemptions, effective death penalty
provisions, and cuts in social spending from this summer's "crime" bill to fund prison
construction and additional law enforcement to keep people secure in their neighborhoods and
kids safe in their schools.<p>
<li><b>The Personal Responsibility Act:</b> Discourage illegitimacy and teen pregnancy by
prohibiting welfare to minor mothers and denying increased AFDC for additional children while
on welfare, cut spending for welfare programs, and enact a tough two-years-and-out provision
with work requirements to promote individual responsibility.<p>
<li><b>The Family Reinforcement Act: </b>Child support enforcement, tax incentives for
adoption,  strengthening rights of parents in their children's education, stronger child
pornography laws, and an elderly dependent care tax credit to reinforce the central role of
families in American society.<p>
<li><b>The American Dream Restoration Act:</b>  A $500 per child tax credit, begin repeal of
the marriage tax penalty, and creation of American Dream Savings Accounts to provide middle
class tax relief.<p>
<li><b> The National Security Restoration Act:</b>  No U.S. troops under U.N. command and
restoration of the essential parts of our national security funding to strengthen our national
defense and maintain our credibility around the world.<p>
<li><b> The Senior Citizens Fairness Act:  </b>Raise the Social Security earnings limit which
currently forces seniors out of the work force, repeal the 1993 tax hikes on Social Security
benefits and provide tax incentives for private long-term care insurance to let Older Americans
keep more of what they have earned over the years.<p>
<li><b>The Job Creation and Wage Enhancement Act: </b> Small business incentives, capital
gains cut and indexation, neutral cost recovery, risk assessment/cost-benefit analysis,
strengthening the Regulatory Flexibility Act and unfunded mandate reform to create jobs and
raise worker wages.<p>
<li><b>The Common Sense Legal Reform Act: </b> "Loser pays" laws, reasonable limits on
punitive damages and reform of product liability laws to stem the endless tide of litigation.<p>
<li><b>The Citizen Legislature Act: </b> A first-ever vote on term limits to replace career
politicians with citizen legislators.<p>
</ul>
     Further, we will instruct the House Budget Committee to report to the floor and we will work
to enact additional budget savings, beyond the budget cuts specifically included in the legislation
described above, to ensure that the Federal budget deficit will be less than it would have been
without the enactment of these bills.<p>

<P>
Long held in high regard by the American public, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has 
managed to squander much of its goodwill in recent years.  The FDA -- wrapped in its own "red-tape 
reality" -- is now under scrutiny.  Democrats, Republicans, patient groups, as well as the industries micro-
managed by the agency, criticize the FDA for its inefficiency, bumbling bureaucracy, and cavalier attitude 
towards business and the American people.
<P>
Under Commissioner David Kessler's leadership, the FDA has become chief advocate for the "nanny 
state."  Centralized, government decision-making for medical consumers and practitioners is the rule of the 
day.  In 1992, Dr. Kessler declared: "If individual patients and doctors made medical decisions on their 
own behalf, then the rationale for the FDA would cease to exist."
<P>
The grand illusion that the government can effectively render personal decisions or highly technical 
determinations laid the foundation for the FDA's failures.  Indeed, the FDA's severe shortcomings, as 
outlined in the following pages, prove that the agency should cease to exist.
<P>
The Small Business Survival (SBS) Foundation continues to review each of the federal government 
agencies as to their impact on entrepreneurship and economic growth.  In terms of selecting an agency that 
drives high-paying jobs and growth industries overseas, the FDA tops the list.  As the FDA has made it 
more difficult to gain medical device and drug approvals, more and more companies flee for friendlier 
regulatory shores.  Lost investment opportunities, lost businesses, and lost jobs, make for a sad 
commentary on the FDA's lack of vision.
<P>
From entrepreneurial medical device firms to vitamin distributors and food companies, the FDA has made 
it known that it is at war with American business -- with consumer casualties mounting.  The new 
leadership in Congress is addressing the many tax and regulatory impediments to entrepreneurship.  Efforts 
are underway to reform and restrain the IRS, OSHA, EPA, and other agencies.  The FDA certainly should 
not be shielded from bold reforms.  In this booklet, SBS Foundation highlights not only the problems, but 
also offers common sense solutions to allow for America's great tradition of risk-taking and innovation to 
continue, while maintaining a check on public safety.

<P>
The U.S. federal government's alphabet soup of agencies -- including OSHA, EPA, IRS, FBI, ATF, and 
more -- seem to be coming under ever closer scrutiny in recent months.  These agencies are being 
examined in terms of their missions, tactics, strategies, budgets, and effects.
<P>
Included in this scrutinized soup bowl is the FDA, or the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  The FDA 
has set the standard for a gridlocked, costly, and even deadly federal bureaucracy.  The agency has gained 
infamy for its ability to throw monkey wrenches into the machinations of some of the most dynamic 
industries of the late twentieth century, such as medical devices and pharmaceuticals.  Indeed, the FDA is 
slowing medical progress, hampering entrepreneurial enterprises, and destroying jobs due to regulatory 
obstacles and bureaucratic gridlock.
<P>
The agency operates under a system of perverse incentives.  First, it possesses a monopoly in terms of drug 
and medical device approvals.  Second, since the FDA suffers consequences when problems develop with 
an approved product, the agency has every incentive to prolong the approval process.    Of course, a 
lengthy and costly approval process generates its own costs in terms of lost businesses, jobs, and lives.  In 
addition, the FDA seems to be plagued by assumptions that afflict much of our society in the late twentieth 
century -- namely, that all risks can be ameliorated in life, and that only the massive costs and bloated 
bureaucracies of government can assure relative safety.
<P>
In the following pages, we shall briefly review the responsibilities of the FDA, the agency's tactics and 
strategies, its impact on America's entrepreneurs, the FDA's budget, and finally propose some much-
needed, market-based reforms.
<P>
<hr>
<a name="three"><H3><CENTER>FDA History and Responsibilities  </a></CENTER></H3>
<P>
The first major federal drug legislation was passed into law in 1906 -- the Pure Food and Drug Act.  It 
forbade false and misleading claims about drugs, holding manufacturers liable for adulterated and 
misbranded drugs.  The Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 required that manufacturers notify the 
government before marketing a drug.  Companies had to test for safety, and if within 60 days the FDA did 
not disapprove based on those test results, the drug was marketable.  In 1962, new regulations shifted the 
FDA to a pre-market approval process.  In 1976, Congress formalized federal regulations regarding 
medical devices, and in 1990 codified FDA pre-market approval of all devices.
<P>
Today, the FDA carries a long list of responsibilities, summarized as: regulating drug, food, cosmetics, 
biological product, and medical device labeling; approving new drugs, biological products, and medical 
devices; setting drug, biological product and medical device manufacturing guidelines; and establishing 
safety and effectiveness standards for drugs, biological products, and medical devices.
<P>
<hr>
<H3><a name="four"><CENTER>FDA 
vs. 
Entrepreneurs 
and Patients</a> </CENTER> </H3>
<P>
As is the case with most regulatory agencies, the FDA seemed like a good idea at first, but it has grown 
into a massive, misguided undertaking.  The FDA has placed enormous burdens on food, pharmaceutical, 
and medical device enterprises -- discouraging investment and risk taking in some of America's leading 
industries.  The FDA seems more intent on exporting American ingenuity and entrepreneurship, rather than 
encouraging the production of U.S.-made drugs and medical devices.
<P>
Examples of the havoc being wrought by the FDA abound:<ul>
<P>
<li>In the August/September 1995 issue of Reason magazine, Rick Henderson reported that "the FDA's 
Center for Devices and Radiological Health takes more than three times longer to approve a Class III or 
'substantial risk' medical device (such life-saving products as heart valves or CAT scanners) than do the 
agency's counterparts in Europe."  What is the impact of such delays?  "In the past 10 months, reports a 
survey published in June by the Health Industry Manufacturers Association, 50 percent of the more than 
500 device makers surveyed had moved some clinical trials of new medical devices overseas; 56 percent 
refused to test new devices on Medicare patients; and 75 percent planned to move their trials to Europe."
<P>
<li>Thomas G. Donlan noted industry trends driven by the FDA's regulatory maze in the July 3, 1995 issue 
of Barron's: "The failure of U.S. regulation can ... be seen in the scrambles that have roiled the industry to 
put research and manufacturing offshore, to make partnerships with foreign drug firms and to merge and 
merge and merge again in an attempt to create firms that are large enough to weather all the risks of 
regulation."
<P>
Of course, market-driven mergers in an industry are by no means worrisome.  However, substantial 
industry changes being driven by regulatory costs should cause regulators and their supposed overseers -- 
i.e., elected officials -- to re-evaluate their regulatory activities.
<P>
<li>Robert Higgs, in a report for the Competitive Enterprise Institute, noted the hurdles companies face even 
when making improvements in already existing products or in their manufacturing processes: "Changes in 
the product or the manufacturing process, no matter how small, might cause the product to be consigned to 
an indefinite stay in preapproval purgatory.  FDA failed to differentiate between new devices and 
manufacturing changes for existing devices.  Manufacturers therefore had a reduced incentive to make the 
minor improvements that, cumulating over time, could greatly improve the performance of their products 
and the efficiency of their manufacturing operations."
<P>
<li>Higgs also reported that FDA policies and conduct have boosted costs for medical device firms 
considerably -- perhaps adding $10 million to $20 million to a firm's budget, as well as several additional 
years before a new device gets to the market.  Such costs greatly reduce venture capital investment in new 
and expanding enterprises making medical devices.  One can only speculate as to the total number of 
potentially life-saving innovations and inventions that fail to reach consumers because regulatory costs 
reduce potential returns to such an extent that capital simply dries up.<P>
Higgs noted that from 1989 to 1991, U.S. medical technology firms invested roughly the same amount 
abroad annually -- $321 million-$333 million.  "Then in 1992, when FDA abruptly made its enforcement 
and approval policies more onerous, capital outflow jumped more than 200 percent to $993 million."
<P>
<li>One also has to wonder whether large firms feel the FDA's battering as severely as smaller and start-up 
enterprises.  Rick Henderson asserts in Reason that large, established pharmaceutical companies have 
benefited from the FDA's regulatory maze.  New, smaller firms lack the resources, expertise, and patience 
to surf the FDA's regulatory tidal wave.  Hence, entrepreneurs wipe out -- the system results in fewer 
competitors for established firms.
<P>
<li>A 1993 report from the House Energy and Commerce Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee 
acknowledged the woes tied to the FDA's approval process for medical devices: "The situation is 
intolerable.  The backlog for pending device applications exceeds 1,100. ... The FDA's enforcement 
practices have demoralized and perplexed much of the medical device industry."
<P>
<li>In testimony before the House Joint Economic Committee Hearing on Technical Innovations in Health 
Care on June 24, 1994, Robert C. DeHaven of the American Electronics Association declared that the 
FDA's "inordinately slow" regulatory process was threatening "the global competitiveness" of the medical 
device industry -- a $70 billion industry with more than 11,000 companies.
<P>
<li>A recent American Electronics Association survey reportedly found that 40 percent of medical device 
firms reduced their number of U.S. employees because of FDA delays, 29 percent boosted investment in 
foreign operations, and 22 percent moved U.S. jobs out of the country. 
<P>
<li>FDA approval times have mounted.  For example, in 1988, it took an average of 78 days for the FDA to 
approve a product change (i.e., a 510-K application); by 1992, approval time had grown to an average of 
126 days.  This number further ballooned to 173 to 213 days by 1994.   These applications are supposed 
to be approved within 90 days, according to FDA guidelines.  
<p>	
Approvals of new devices take anywhere from 437 to 840 days. New device approvals, however, are 
supposed to be completed within 180 days.
<P>
Meanwhile, the median approval time for generic drug applications stretched out from 12 months to 38 
months between 1986 and 1993.  Of course, these numbers exclude FDA requirements placed on firms 
that extend development time.
<P>
<li>The overall time it takes for a drug company to create, develop, and gain approval for a drug almost 
doubled from the 1960s to the 1990s, from an average of 8.1 years to 15 years.
<P>
<li>When compared with many other nations, a clear lag in drug approval in the United States exists.  For 
example, from 1985 through 1993, just 27 percent of the FDA's new drug approvals received their first 
marketing approval in the U.S.  Between 1982 and mid-1992, 82 percent of new biopharmaceutical drugs 
originated in the U.S., 14 percent in Europe, and 4 percent in Japan; 86 percent were first tested in the U.S. 
and 14 percent in Europe; yet, only 25 percent were first marketed in the U.S. and 75 percent in Europe.  
Of all drugs approved in the U.S., 12 percent had been available in foreign markets for 6-10 years, and 
another 9 percent were available for more than a decade.  In the area of psychotropic drugs (drugs 
treating mental ills), 17 percent were available in foreign markets for 6-10 years prior to U.S. availability, 
with another 17 percent for more than a decade.
<P>
These approval lags do not seem to necessarily translate into enhanced safety.  For example, Great Britain 
gets drugs to market quicker than the U.S., yet safety discontinuations as a percentage of total new drug 
introductions were similar in each country -- 4 percent in Great Britain and 3 percent in the U.S.
<P>
<li>A February 10, 1993 Wall Street Journal editorial ("Kessler's Devices") explained 1992's sharp increase 
in medical devise approval times this way: "The onset of these delays is no accident: they coincide with the 
aftermath of the Kessler-Congress jihad against breast implants.  With that searing event, word went out to 
FDA reviewers that all devices were to get new scrutiny.  John Dingell added to the fear by inviting some 
agency bureaucrats to visit his re-education camp on Capitol Hill.  Reviewers naturally began to ask more 
questions, demand more data and stonewall applications.  The resulting gridlock has been industrywide, 
affecting everything from catheters to imaging products for advanced surgery, tissue forceps, surgical 
staplers, lasers, and so on."
<P>
Of course, it was subsequently reported that several studies failed to show any link between silicone breast 
implants and various ailments that had been attributed to them by the FDA and a host of contingency-fee 
lawyers.
<P>
<li>The FDA continues to be embroiled in a controversy over the approval of Ambu International Inc.'s 
cardiopump, designed to help revive patients in cardiac arrest.  It has been approved and is on the market in 
many other countries including Canada, Great Britain, and France -- while ambulances in Austria are 
required to carry the pump.  
<P>
<li>In 1990, as The Wall Street Journal's Brent Bowers reported (May 18, 1993), the FDA notified the 
McCurdy Fish Co. in Lubec, Maine -- reportedly the lone U.S. company in the smoked-herring industry -- 
that it would have to significantly alter its process for producing smoked herring.  Since the turn of the 
century, the company had eviscerated the fish after the salting and smoking process; now the FDA 
demanded evisceration before salting and smoking.  Never mind that in the 20 years that John McCurdy 
ran the company -- producing three million pounds or 54 million filets of herring -- there was not one 
reported case of food poisoning.  McCurdy could not afford to buy the new equipment -- the business 
closed and Lubec, Maine lost 22 jobs.
<P>
<li>For almost the past decade, H. Earl Wright has been wrestling with the FDA over his Sensor Pad, 
designed to aid women with breast self-examination.  The pad has long been approved for sale in European 
and Asian nations.
<P>
<li>The Wall Street Journal reported on April 12, 1994 that one company -- International Rehabilitative 
Sciences Inc. -- already had FDA approval for its muscle stimulators, but since the company does business 
as RS Medical, it sought clearance a second time in 1990 in order to clarify ownership.  The FDA denied 
the application and rescinded its original approval.  Believing it was mistreated, the company decided to 
test the FDA's process by re-applying and having its consulting firm apply as well.  RS Medical was denied 
approval while the consulting firm received approval.  RS Medical took the FDA to court and won.
<P>
<li>The chief executive of the Minnesota-based Minntech Corp., Louis Cosentino, best summed up the effect 
of the FDA on entrepreneurs and the U.S. economy: "The attitude of the FDA is so antibusiness and so 
negative at this point that any prudent CEO has to be looking outside the U.S. as a safe haven."  Minntech 
laid off 50 Minnesota employees while expanding in Europe.
<P></ul>
Meanwhile, the so-called benefits for consumers from all these added delays and costs remain difficult to 
detect.  In fact, bureaucratic delays by the FDA apparently cost thousands of lives annually, as products 
and treatments are being denied to American consumers.
<P>
<hr>
<H3><a name="five"><CENTER>Export Restrictions</CENTER></a>  </H3>
<P>
The FDA erects barriers to the export of U.S. medical products as well.  Even if a product has been 
approved for use in a foreign country, the FDA generally does not allow for exportation to that nation if the 
product has not received FDA approval.  Again, in the case of medical devices, a lengthy FDA approval 
process is needed in order to export.  
<P>
The CEO of a medical device company was denied permission to export by the FDA -- so he moved the 
company from the U.S. to Switzerland.  The CEO observed: "The FDA denied us permission to export. ... 
So we had to export our manufacturing plant." 
<P>
<hr>
<H3><a name="six"><CENTER>FDA Intrusions</CENTER></a></H3>
<P>
However, the FDA does not stop at mere incompetence and bureaucratic gridlock.  In the 1990s, under the 
guidance of FDA Commissioner David Kessler, the FDA's enforcement efforts have become increasingly 
aggressive and intrusive.
<P>
Reports abound of the FDA's confrontational methods under Dr. Kessler's reign.  For example:<ul>
<P>
<li>In the May 1995 issue of Reason magazine, analyst Alexander Volokh reported: "Since 1990, when 
David Kessler took over as FDA commissioner, enforcement has been one of the FDA's top priorities.  In 
his first two months, Kessler added 100 new criminal investigators to his enforcement staff, many of them 
formerly with the Secret Service and Drug Enforcement Administration.  Armed raids on alternative health 
clinics and dietary supplement dealers followed, as well as increased warning letters, product seizures, and 
criminal prosecutions in the drug and device industries."
<P>
<li>In the January 1995 issue of The American Spectator ("Double-Crossing to Safety"), James Bovard 
reported on the FDA's raid on Proctor & Gamble's "Citrus Hill Fresh Choice" orange juice.  The FDA 
disputed the use of the word "fresh" on the label, saying it was misleading.  Proctor & Gamble noted a 
survey showing that consumers knew that "Fresh Choice" did not mean fresh squeezed, and besides, "Made 
from Concentrate" was also on the label.  Bovard reported: "Kessler ... took sweeping action: He ordered 
U.S. marshalls to seize the juice -- 12,000 gallons, as it turned out -- and destroy it.  Federal law declares 
that a 'misbranded' or 'mislabeled' product is automatically unsafe, and provides FDA with the authority to 
confiscate the merchandise."
<P>
Of course, the orange juice was both safe and healthy.  Dr. Kessler's actions, however, sent a signal that it 
was "get tough" time at the FDA, no matter how ridiculous the agency might seem.  Power would win out 
over reason.
<P>
<li>Bovard noted another raid.  This time the FDA launched an assault on vitamins not orange juice: "On 
May 6, 1992, a platoon of sixteen FDA inspectors and local police in flak jackets carried out a no-knock 
raid, smashing in the door of the Tahoma Clinic in Kent, Washington.  They held the staff at gunpoint, 
ostensibly so that nobody could try to hide the vitamins.  The raiders seized more than $100,000 in 
products and office supplies -- including address books and diaries -- and spent 14 hours cleaning out the 
office; they even tore the phones out of the wall.  FDA agents were supposedly concerned about the clinic's 
use of injected B-vitamins, which have been widely used in Germany with no adverse health problems."
<P>
<li>Commissioner Kessler was appointed by President George Bush, but reportedly lobbied hard to keep his 
job under President Clinton.  Kessler worked to ingratiate himself with the president-to-be with a list of 
aggressive regulatory actions.  On December 8, 1992, during the White House transition, Kessler offered 
his view of the FDA in remarks before the Food and Drug Law Institute's 36th Annual Educational 
Conference.  His emphasis on re-regulation and more aggressive enforcement was clear, as noted by the 
following excerpts:
<P>
"We needed to send out a message that, ultimately, it was in no one's interest to deregulate a public health 
regulatory agency."
<P>
"We're paying more attention to our field these days.  We've become once again an FDA that vigorously 
enforces the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, and not just an agency that approves products and 
educates consumers and the industry."
<P>
"Our enforcement people have fewer hoops to jump through, fewer boxes that must be checked off."
<P>
"We rely much less on voluntary agreements and much more on court-enforceable consent decrees."
<P>
"To complement the regular FDA field force we've created an Office of Criminal Investigations, not to be 
confused with the new Office of Investigations.  Thirty new special agents began intense training last week 
at a federal law enforcement training center in Georgia."
<P>
"In just over a year we've cleared the deck of uncompleted and abandoned regulatory proposals; we're 
getting new regulations out faster than ever before ..."
<P>
Commissioner Kessler, of course,  kept his job.
<P>
<li>This time writing in The Wall Street Journal (December 8, 1994), James Bovard observed another FDA 
tactic: "FDA employees are also sowing fear with a deluge of official Warning Letters (up more than 300% 
since Dr. Kessler took office).  Once the FDA issues a Warning Letter, it can seize a company's products or 
get a court injunction to paralyze its operations.  The FDA has refused to establish clear guidelines or rules 
for issuing its letters.  As a result, manufacturers can find themselves in a nightmare at the whim of a mid-
level FDA employee."
<P>
<li>In a letter to The American Spectator (April 1995), Dennis Plank, Editor-Publisher of the FDA Hotline, 
writes on how well federal regulatory agencies work together when it comes to regulatory crack downs: "A 
frightening current trend is how successful the FDA has become in pushing the buttons at other federal 
agencies to attack vitamin, supplement, and herbal manufacturers and suppliers.  We have reported on 
stepped-up enforcement actions by OSHA, FTC, Customs, Postal Service, and the DEA.  The Federal 
Trade Commission has now become the FDA's bully boy with no less than twenty cases pending against 
vitamin and natural product manufacturers."
<P>
<li>One of the FDA's most aggressive moves just occurred.  It did not involve a physical raid on a company's 
facilities.  Instead, it amounts to the beginnings of a power raid on an entire American industry.  According 
to published reports, on Wednesday, July 15, 1995, the FDA declared nicotine to be a drug, linking this 
conclusion to concern over tobacco products being sold to minors.  
<P>
Of course, it is currently illegal to sell tobacco products to minors.  In reality, the FDA's declaration of 
nicotine as a drug lays the ground work for extensive control over the manufacturing and distribution of 
tobacco products by the FDA.  
<P>
Most recognize that smoking is bad for your health, as are so many other undertakings.  Tobacco, like 
other things, is a legally grown, packaged, and sold product in the United States.  What happens now that 
the FDA is calling nicotine a drug?  Are tobacco farmers and convenience store owners to become outlaws, 
part of organized crime, or perhaps pharmacists?  Are the FDA's enforcement tactics, as described above, 
to be extended to tobacco farms and convenience stores?  What about smokers?  The effect of the FDA 
calling nicotine a drug goes well beyond concern over youth smoking -- it is an issue of extending the 
control of the nanny state.
<P>
Indeed, why stop at nicotine?  What about other habit forming substances?    For those of us who are 
overweight and enjoy drinking caffeine-laden beverages, will the FDA soon classify cheeseburgers, 
caffeine, and sugar as drugs -- how about hot dogs?
<P></ul>
As government agencies often do, the FDA has proven to be both hypocritical and incompetent.  Dr. 
Kessler and the FDA would better serve the public's health by improving the efficiency of their medical 
device and drug approval processes.  Unfortunately, Dr. Kessler's reign seems more about control.  It was 
reported in a recent article in Business Week (July 31, 1995) regarding Dr. Kessler, "Even close friends 
wonder if the bearded Long Island native might not do better to spend his time expediting approval for new 
drugs and medical devices, and fixing other FDA shortcomings."
<P>
The Washington Times reported on July 31, 1995 that former chief FDA investigator Jim Phillips sent a 
letter to the U.S. House Commerce panel on July 14 saying a half-dozen projects had been placed on hold 
due to the agency's obsession with investigating tobacco.  For example, Phillips is quoted as declaring the 
FDA's foreign inspection program as a "disaster waiting to happen."  He told the Times, "For the better part 
of the spring of 1994, Dr. Kessler spent virtually all of his time on cigarettes.  I can recall several instances 
in which I tried to contact Dr. Kessler on important matters and was told by his secretary that if my topic 
was anything other than cigarettes, the commissioner would have no time for me."

<H3><a name="seven"><CENTER>FDA Budget  and Employees</a></CENTER></H3>
<P>
When confronted with such a checkered and costly performance record, many FDA defenders will say that 
the agency is simply in need of more resources.  However, FDA budget and employment levels tell quite a 
different story.
<P>
Figure 1, on the following page, shows the FDA's budget authority for select years since 1955 in inflation-
adjusted 1994 dollars.  Budget growth at the FDA indeed has been robust.  For example:
<P><ul>
<li>Just from 1989 to 1994, real FDA budget authority increased by 52.6 percent -- or by an average annual 
real rate of more than 10.5 percent.
<P>
<li>Between 1970 and 1994, real FDA budget authority increased by 221.1 percent.
<P>
<li>And between 1955 and 1994, the FDA's real budget authority rose by 2,978 percent.  Though the FDA's 
powers were enhanced considerably in the early 1960s, an average annual boost in real FDA budget dollars 
since 1955 of more than 76 percent is incredible.
<P>
 Figure 2 (page 16) illustrates the growth in employment at the FDA.  Again, a shortage of manpower does 
not seem to plague the agency.  For example:
<P>
<li>Between 1989 and 1994, FDA full-time employees grew by a substantial 25.3 percent.
<P>
<li>Between 1970 and 1994, FDA full-time employees increased by 115.7 percent.
<P>
<li>And between 1955 and 1994, full-time employees at the FDA increased by 933.4 percent.
<P></ul>
<hr>
<H3> <a name="eight"><CENTER>Incentives Problem</a></CENTER></H3>
<P>
Considering the great leaps in real budget authority and employment at the FDA, it would seem clear that 
the FDA does not lack for sufficient resources.  Instead, what the FDA lacks are proper incentives -- as is 
the case with most government undertakings.  Costs and performance in government -- unlike the private 
sector -- take a back seat to concerns over expanding power, budgets, and employment.  Without a profit 
motive, costs inevitably rise and performance declines.
<P>
In addition, the FDA possesses every incentive to prolong the drug and medical-device approval processes, 
since the agency monopolizes these activities and can face significant consequences when a problem 
develops in an approved product.  In contrast, the FDA loses virtually nothing when businesses and 
patients suffer because of agency delays.  Businesses and patients who die from FDA delays receive little 
attention.
<P>
In summary, taxpayers and consumers are spending more to get less from the FDA.  FDA delays, added 
costs, export restrictions, narrow-minded regulations, overly aggressive regulators, and mounting budgets 
are costing the United States in terms of lost businesses, jobs, and even lives.
<P>
Real reform means reduced costs and improved performance.  That translates into greater private-sector 
involvement in the safety of U.S. food, drugs, and medical devices.
<P>
<hr>
<H3><a name="nine"><CENTER>Market-Based Reforms</a></CENTER></H3>
<P>
The list of FDA shortcomings is quite lengthy.  Much to the chagrin of Commissioner Kessler, the FDA 
indeed should be "just an agency that approves products and educates consumers and the industry."  In the 
regulatory environment, anything more seems to breed hostility, often insurmountable costs, over-
zealousness, arrogance, big budgets, and massive intrusions on the part of regulators -- such as seizures of 
orange juice and armed raids on vitamin clinics.  
<P>
Entrepreneurs in the medical device, pharmaceutical, and food industries meet the most essential human 
needs -- sustenance and medical care.  The costs and risks of improving upon and/or creating new products 
in such areas remain substantial -- including the potential of enormous liability costs in a legal system gone 
awry.  Unfortunately, the FDA has managed to significantly add to these costs -- not only through delays 
and additional regulatory requirements, but through unpredictable, intrusive actions.    Entrepreneurs, 
however, are not the enemy; they are the driving force behind society's great leaps in technology, new 
products and services. 
<P>
The FDA's philosophy should not be one of making an example of a company in order to send a signal to 
other firms.  Instead, the agency should build a cooperative relationship with some of America's most 
dynamic and crucial industries.  Unfortunately, the FDA seems incapable of such a massive shift in attitude 
and culture.  Former U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Louis Sullivan was correct when he 
recently noted in The Washington Times (June 27, 1995) that the FDA may be beyond reform:
<P>
"Instead of making yet another effort to reform a system that seems incapable of reform, we should begin 
thinking about the design of a new system.  In my view, such a system would require considerable 
decentralization, perhaps along the lines of the European systems, where non-government institutions play 
a much greater role in the process of reviewing and approving new medical products."
<P>
One should be somewhat encouraged by the fact that the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives also 
acknowledges considerable problems with the FDA.  In fact, Speaker Newt Gingrich went so far as to refer 
to the FDA as a "Stalinistic" agency and the "leading job killer" in the nation.  Under the FDA's yoke, 
entrepreneurs and businesses possess every incentive to cease research and development, shift operations 
and jobs out of the country, or close down altogether.
<P>
Bold steps need to be taken:  
<P><ul>
<li>The FDA should be scrapped in favor of a smaller agency geared toward safety and education.  
According to economist James Bovard, writing in the December 8, 1994 Wall Street Journal: "Rep. 
Gingrich favors replacing the FDA with an agency staffed with medical entrepreneurs, with strict limits on 
their time in government."  While one has to wonder why entrepreneurs would be willing to staff a 
government agency, the sentiment is correct.  
<P>
The Speaker's idea raises another question: Can FDA regulators ever be qualified enough to register sound 
judgments regarding  dynamic enterprises in, for example, the biomedical industry?  Tapping medical 
entrepreneurs is a good idea, but perhaps better achieved by allowing private firms to undertake safety 
approvals. 
<P>
The private sector -- medical entrepreneurs certified by the government -- is more capable of establishing 
an efficient drug and medical device approval processes.  Conceivably, the approval process would be 
contracted out, or preferably, companies themselves could hire private-sector entities for approvals.  
Universities, hospitals, researchers, and other firms could be certified by the government as drug or 
medical device approval entities.
<P>
<li>Efficacy should be left to the marketplace.  The government has a role in helping to secure consumers 
against substantial risks they could not know about -- i.e., safety -- as well as fraud.  Determining the 
efficacy of products, though, should be left to doctors, hospitals, experts, consumer groups, individuals, et 
al.
<P>
<li>Manufacturers and approval enterprises should be subject to the incentives of a sound legal system.  
However, huge awards for "pain and suffering" and punitive damages, contingency-fee lawyers, a plague 
of frivolous lawsuits, and much more, work against that soundness.  Product liability costs can terminate 
the life of a business, or simply extinguish it before an entrepreneur gives it life.  In such an environment, 
capital flees to industries where costs and risks are much smaller.
<P>
Industry often is regulated in one of two ways -- either by direct government regulation or through the 
legal system, i.e., the threat of a lawsuit.  Unfortunately, businesses must incur the costs of both systems 
today.  In the pharmaceuticals and medical device industries, the burdens of both government regulations 
and product liability are massive.
<P>
While firms should be liable for negligence or for misleading approval bodies, "regulatory compliance" 
and "state of knowledge" defenses should be allowed for firms that met all regulatory and safety 
requirements.
<P>
<li>The FDA currently disallows manufacturers from distributing information regarding off-label uses of 
drugs, such as independent studies and journal articles.  This dangerous ban should be lifted.  Doctors and 
patients need a steady flow of information about possible treatments.  Government, in no way, should 
hinder the free flow of information.
<P>
<li>A federal agency's enforcement powers, as well as its processes and standards for determining what 
products fall under its jurisdiction, should be scrutinized and reviewed annually by Congress.  Each 
individual policy decision approved by the President should receive the same examination.  Bizarre orange 
juice and vitamin raids should not be allowed to happen, nor should our elected officials be able to say that 
they were unable to stop such actions.
<P>
<li>The U.S. should negotiate and enter into agreements with other nations to recognize each other's drug 
and medical device approvals.
<P>
<li>Lastly, incentives for investment in dynamic industries, like pharmaceuticals and medical devices, need 
to be enhanced.  The aforementioned reforms are based on this premise.  Also, though having nothing to do 
with the FDA, one of the most productive steps that could be taken along this path is the elimination of 
capital gains taxes.  We have already noted the risky nature of drug and medical-device ventures.  High 
risks must be accompanied by at least the opportunity for substantial rewards.  A zero percent capital gains 
tax rate would help provide such opportunities -- boosting entrepreneurship, competition, and growth.
<P></ul>
The FDA is taking a heavy toll on the U.S. economy in terms of lost entrepreneurship, investment, jobs, 
and international competitiveness.  In a world where both capital and labor can move with increasing ease 
and freedom, the U.S. regulatory regime operates within an increasingly competitive global environment.  
A government agency that delays the approvals of beneficial drugs and medical devices to the degree that 
the FDA does, ensures that U.S.-based firms function at a severe disadvantage.  Of course, not only does 
this mean less investment, slower economic growth, and fewer jobs, but it also means that U.S. consumers 
often are denied access to life-saving  devices and treatments.
<P>
Competition can do wonders.  The U.S. regulatory regime acts as a severe drag on our economy.  Congress 
must act to make the U.S. food and drug regulatory environment more competitive on the world stage, or 
continue to lose cutting-edge firms and high-paying jobs to other nations.
<P>
<hr>
<H3><a name="ten"><CENTER>Still Tea Time at the FDA</a></CENTER></H3>
<P>
On February 23, 1993, The Wall Street Journal ran a story on its front page entitled "Perpetual Tea Time 
May Come to an End for Top U.S. Tea Taster," written by Bruce Ingersoll.  That's right, the federal 
government -- more specifically the FDA --employs tea tasters.
<P>
It seems that since the passage of the Tea Importation Act of 1897, federal taxpayers have paid for the U.S. 
Board of Tea Experts, with part of the board's tab picked up by the tea industry.  As a department of the 
FDA, the board's essential duty is to ensure that imported tea tastes alright.
<P>
Though certainly not a budget breaker, the FDA's tea tasters well represent the government's cavalier 
manner as to how it spends money.  The Journal reported that the Board of Tea Tasters costs about 
$200,000 annually, with its top tea taster making $60,000.  Upon entering office, President Clinton, like 
Presidents Nixon and Carter previously, was intent on terminating tea time at the FDA.
<P>
However, SBS Foundation called the FDA's Brooklyn, New York office -- home to the FDA's top tea taster 
-- in late July of this year.  The U.S. Board of Tea Experts still exists, answering the phone, "Tea room."  
<P>
Clearly, the FDA's tea room needs to go -- an example of government waste.  However, the Journal did 
report that many have praised Mr. Robert Dick -- the FDA's now 80-year-old tea taster -- as an 
"unbureaucratic bureaucrat."  A private-sector tea taster for Redco Foods Inc. reported, "In my experience, 
he evaluates tea the same day he receives it."  If lawmakers ever finally muster the courage to turn off the 
teapots at the FDA's tea room, maybe Mr. Dick could give some pointers to the FDA's drug and medical 
device departments on how to speed along approvals.

</CENTER>
<blockquote>
I would like to thank Ray Keating and the Small Business Survival Committee, and commend them for the 
hard work they have put into this important booklet.  I unfortunately have been very involved with 
Superfund for several years now.  I am glad, however, that we have this opportunity to address the 
problems with the program and fix it the way it should be fixed.  
<P>
Soon after being elected in 1990, I learned that I had 14 National Priority List (NPL) sites in my district.  
After hearing dozens of real-life horror stories of what these sites were doing to small businesses and 
municipalities, I formed the NH Superfund Task Force.
<P>
We worked for about a year to study the problems and make some suggested solutions.  We came up with a 
series of recommendations which I turned into H.R. 4161, the "Comprehensive Superfund Improvement 
Act," and introduced it in the 103rd Congress.
<P>
While that bill addressed many different areas, the most important part addressed liability.  Specifically, the 
elimination of retroactive liability and the replacement of joint and several liability with a fair share 
allocation system.
<P>
This year I've introduced H.R. 2256.  This is significant legislation because it presents a road map for what 
I believe is the best way to make Superfund work in the fairest and quickest way possible.  My legislation 
will repeal Superfund's unfair, unjust, and un-American retroactive and joint and several liability system 
for actions that were legal at the time.  They will be replaced with a fair share liability system that will only 
hold people responsible for what they actually contributed to a Superfund site.
<P>
Despite the billions of taxpayer dollars that have been spent on Superfund, we now see that a mere 18 
percent of Superfund sites have been cleaned up.  This raises the obvious question of whether or not we are 
getting our money's worth?  These facts -- especially when combined with a GAO report released recently 
which says that only one-third of all Superfund sites pose an actual risk to human health -- make it obvious 
to me that we are not getting our money's worth.
<P>
So what is costing Americans so much money while causing these sites to sit idle for years with no clean 
up?  It is Superfund's misguided liability system.  We can make all the reforms and changes we want to the 
Superfund program, but if we do not fundamentally reform the liability system, we will be back here again 
having the same conversation in a few years.  Taxpayers are spending billions on lawyers while very few 
of these sites are getting cleaned up.
<P>
Recently the House Small Business Committee held a hearing on the impact of Superfund liability on small 
businesses.  What we heard were stories of small businessmen and women from all over the nation about 
how they have been brought to the brink of bankruptcy by this program -- all brought about by the current 
liability system.
<P>
We also learned that the Department of Justice spends over $30 million  per year on Superfund 
enforcement.  That's more than they spend on Clean Water, Clean Air, and RCRA enforcement combined!
<P>
In addition to this feeding frenzy for lawyers, the Superfund liability system has created an atmosphere in 
which the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) acts like prosecutor, judge, and jury.  They 
assume you are guilty until you can prove yourself innocent, and threaten you with huge fines and criminal 
action if you do not do what they say.
<P>
Once you have been named as a "potentially responsible party" (PRP) by the EPA, your journey is just 
beginning.  You will have to withstand endless EPA inquiries, endure hours of tedious work looking for 
old records from decades ago which may no longer exist, and pay lawyers to represent you and help prove 
your innocence.  Even then you are faced with third-party suits or insurance litigation to recover some or 
all of your costs.  
<P>
EPA and the Department of Justice have taken a program designed to clean up the nation's most toxic sites 
and turned it into a program that feeds the legal system and creates an atmosphere of where they have 
complete and total control over the fate of thousands of small businesses.
<P>
There is such a thing as too much government control, as we all know too well.  Superfund's liability 
system -- in addition to all its other failures -- has led to an out-of-control federal bureaucracy at EPA and 
the Department of Justice at the expense of hard-working Americans.
<P>
Another gentleman who testified before the Small Business Committee told us about how he had been a 
PRP for 8 years, and spent over $10,000 defending himself against a false charge.  Then, moments before a 
Congressional hearing on Superfund reform earlier this year, he was told by EPA Administrator Browner 
that he was no longer a PRP at that site.
<P>
While he was happy to have been let off, the gentleman was livid at the fact that he had spent nearly a 
decade and thousands of dollars fighting, only to be told before a Congressional hearing that he was free -- 
just so Administrator Browner could use it for political points and say "see how cooperative we are?"  Why 
was this man put through the expense and years of personal terror by EPA?  Why are tens of thousands of 
others similarly persecuted by EPA?  It is the liability system -- that's why.
<P>
In summary, the retroactive liability system in current law costs us billions of dollars ... delays clean ups 
for over 10 years ... gives government entirely too much control ... and creates an atmosphere in which 
there is absolutely no effort made to cooperate and in which the constitutional right of "innocent until 
proven guilty" is thrown right out the window.
<P>
The people of the United States deserve nothing less than a full repeal -- they deserve a clean environment 
and they deserve to be assured that their hard-earned tax dollars are going to clean up these sites rather than 
pay for endless armies of lawyers.
<P>
I urge my colleagues to examine every possible method to repeal retroactive liability before they take the 
final vote on Superfund legislation.  Holding people responsible for things they did that were perfectly 
legal is un-American, unfair, unjust, and must be changed.  Superfund is the most flawed law on our books 
and it is unconscionable for us, as legislators, to ignore a process which has destroyed so many people and 
so many businesses.  I urge small businessmen and women around the nation to take action now -- we must 
do what's right.  Let's not use a band-aid for a problem that requires a tourniquet.  Write and call your 
Congressmen and Senators now, and tell them you want fundamental liability reform in any Superfund 
reform package.
<P>
Best wishes.

<H3><CENTER><a name="two">Message from the President</a></CENTER></H3>

After years of watching billions of taxpayers dollars wasted, and thousands of small businesses legally and 
economically terrorized, the United States Congress has finally recognized that it is time to overhaul the 
federal law named "Superfund."
<P>
Since its inception fifteen years ago, Superfund has principally served not as a means to cleaning up 
hazardous materials, but rather as a feeding trough for lawyers and bureaucrats alike.  These individuals 
seem to care little about the environment, being more concerned with enriching themselves at the expense 
of innocent parties and unsuspecting taxpayers.  Through this booklet, "Highly Toxic: The Superfund 
Assault on Common Sense, Business and Entrepreneurship," the Small Business Survival Committee 
(SBSC) reveals Superfund's misguided beginnings and how it has turned into a surreal nightmare for those 
caught in its web.
<P>
Regardless of "good" intentions, Superfund has cleaned up only a fraction of the so-called waste sites 
designated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), despite the fact that the federal government 
and the private sector together have spent at least $90 billion on clean up costs.  With future expenditure 
estimates as high as $1.25 trillion, Superfund indeed should be closely scrutinized.
<P>
Practically every aspect of Superfund is a mess -- a prime candidate for the "dysfunctional-government 
poster program."  The EPA's criteria for selecting Superfund sites, its designation of "potentially 
responsible parties," and the allocation of clean up costs are all grossly misguided.
<P>
Over 17,000 pages of regulations have been issued in the Federal Register on Superfund.  Most 
disturbingly, the hand of Superfund extends retroactively -- unfairly dragging businesses, cities and other 
innocent parties into legal battles.  Estimates place up to half of the resources exhausted on clean up going 
to legal and administrative fees.  In particular, small businesses and entrepreneurs simply cannot absorb the 
large, inflated costs of clean up.  Nor can they afford to engage in legal squabbles that involve being 
targeted by the EPA as a "polluter."
<P>
Superfund certainly is more hazardous to small businesses, taxpayers and local governments than the waste 
materials it was supposed to clean up.  When the new Congress talks of reining in the unbridled regulatory 
monster, clearly Superfund must be at the top of the list.  "Highly Toxic" examines the history, costs and 
effects of Superfund in order to educate the public, media and lawmakers about a program careening out of 
control.  This booklet also offers common-sense reform measures to clean up a government program 
proven to be toxic for businesses and taxpayers alike.

<CENTER><H3><a name="three">Introduction</a></H3></CENTER>

Can you imagine the federal government getting involved in an issue for all the wrong reasons and 
eventually making matters worse rather than better?  Of course you can.  Indeed, many of us see this as the 
case with numerous federal government endeavors -- from various taxes, rules and regulations to welfare, 
education and health care.
<P>
In 1980, the federal government injected itself deeply into the process of cleaning up hazardous and not-so-
hazardous waste sites across the nation with the passage of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, 
Compensation and Liability Act -- better known as "Superfund."  Undertaken for the wrong reasons, 
Superfund unleashed the bloated bureaucracy and gross inefficiencies of the federal government on often 
unsuspecting individuals and businesses; turned essentially local or, at most, state problems into national 
woes;  set arbitrary and unattainable criteria for compliance; sent legal costs skyrocketing; forced many 
businesses to close their doors; reduced capital available for investment in certain industries; restrained job 
growth; and damaged U.S. international competitiveness.
<P>
Small businesses -- seeking out additional capital for growth or often just fighting to stay alive -- are 
particularly vulnerable to a Superfund gone awry.  Legal costs, expenditures for cleaning up sites to which 
they contributed little, groping through the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) bureaucracy, and a 
thick fog obscuring future costs and risks, can stop a small business in its tracks and even kill it.
<P>
Perhaps the most glaring problem with Superfund, though, is its mechanism for assigning liability to 
perfectly innocent parties.  Under this perverse federal legislation, if you disposed of waste -- toxic or non-
toxic, large or insignificant amounts -- in good conscience and in complete accordance with the law, you 
could still be held liable for the costs of cleaning up the disposal site if it later became a Superfund site.  
Notions of responsibility and fairness mean absolutely nothing under Superfund.
<P>
Despite massive amounts of both private and public expenditures, few of the waste sites targeted for clean 
up by the EPA under Superfund actually have been cleaned up.
<P>
Indeed, individuals from across the economic and political spectrums believe that Superfund has been an 
abysmal failure.  Differences arise, however, as to whether the program merely needs some fine tuning, a 
complete overhaul, or outright termination.
<P>
The following pages will provide an overview of Superfund's history, examine its impact on business,  
entrepreneurship and the economy, and offer much-needed reform measures.

<H3><CENTER><a name="four">The Origin of Superfund</a></CENTER>
</H3>
As children, many of us read comic books that told tales of our favorite superheros.  Seemingly without 
failure, our hero gained super powers due to the fallout -- usually of the radiation variety --  from some 
industrial accident or government experiment gone awry.  The fictional hero would then go on to a long 
career of fighting crime, righting wrongs,  and battling various evil-doers.
<P>
In similar fashion, Superfund gained its powers due to the political fallout from a particular waste site.  
Unfortunately, in this case, fiction became part of reality.  Love Canal gave birth to Superfund.
<P>
Most of us have heard, at least casually, the story of how a private company's waste dump created an 
environmental catastrophe affecting families and children in Love Canal, New York -- leading to an 
evacuation.  Thankfully, in a recent article, CATO Institute economist Jerry Taylor reminded us of the true 
story behind Love Canal.1  
<P>
The company in question -- the Hooker Electrochemical Company -- "legally disposed of 21,800 tons of its 
wastes in the abandoned canal trenches of the area from 1942 to 1953."  The company chose this particular 
area due to the impermeable clay soil, which would protect groundwater, and its rural nature, limiting 
potential exposure.  However, the expanding suburbs of Niagara Falls started to encroach on the site, and 
the local school board sought the land for an elementary school.  Hooker initially refused to sell, but the 
board threatened to use its power of eminent domain.  Hooker fully informed the school board of all the 
risks -- including having them present at on-site tests.  Nonetheless, the board "bought" the land from 
Hooker for $1.2  
<P>
Taylor explains the subsequent damage wrought by the school board:
<P>
  "Hooker Electrochemical's careful attempts to contain the waste and warn of the site's dangers were 
immediately undone by the school board.  Thousands of cubic yards of the clay cap [laid by Hooker] were 
scraped away in the course of constructing the school and later during the landscaping of a housing 
development that was built on the site.  The board's attempted sale of the land in 1957 for residential 
purposes was vigorously opposed by Hooker."3  
<P>
Alas, Hooker pleaded to no avail.  The land was sold to developers, and the construction of city sewer lines 
breached the site.  Taylor observes: "What we have, then, is not a parable of rapacious, shortsighted 
capitalists putting profit above public health, but the story of a conscientious company whose best efforts 
were undone by shortsighted public officials who put immediate political return above the general 
welfare."4  
<P>
By largely riding public outcry over this misunderstood incident, the federal government passed the 
Superfund legislation in 1980.  As the reader will quickly see, Superfund is no super program.  Heroes 
cannot be found in this story, only villains and victims.
<P>
<hr>
<H3><CENTER><a name="five">The Superfund Prescription</a></CENTER></H3>

Superfund was built on the dubious assumption that the federal government should trump states and 
localities in terms of dealing with waste sites across the nation.  
<P>
Initially, Superfund was intended to force companies to clean up their hazardous wastes and to deal with 
"orphan" sites -- sites abandoned where responsible parties could not be found.  Congress originally 
authorized a trust fund of $1.6 billion for orphan-site clean ups -- thought more than adequate at the time.  
With the 1990 budget deal, the fund ballooned to more than $15 billion.5   The EPA -- with no objection 
from our federal elected officials -- greatly expanded the scope of Superfund.
<P>
In theory, the Superfund can be used to clean up a site on the National Priority List (NPL).  The EPA then 
tracks down "potentially responsible parties" (PRPs) and assigns responsibility and costs for waste site 
clean ups.  Increasingly, though, the EPA forces PRPs to undertake the clean up from the very start.  Non-
compliance without "sufficient cause" results in a fine of at least $25,000 per day.6   
<P>
In determining liability, the EPA utilizes highly questionable criteria:<ul>

<li> Superfund allows for strict liability -- regardless of intent or negligence.

<li> Superfund liability is retroactive, meaning that actions taken before the law was enacted still apply.  So 
even if firms were in full compliance of the law prior to 1980, Superfund still exposes them to liability.

<li> Joint and several liability also applies under Superfund.  Therefore, the EPA can require that one business 
pay for the clean up irrespective of the degree of its own contribution to the waste site and without 
consideration to the total number of contributors.  No concept of "fair share" exists under Superfund.  
Seeking relief, this unfortunate EPA selectee files contribution suits against other businesses connected to 
the waste site.  All parties tend to turn to their insurance companies for reimbursement.

<li> Indeed, current or past owners of a Superfund site who contributed absolutely nothing to the waste 
problem can be held liable.

<li> The burden of proof lies with the accused to prove their innocence rather than the EPA proving guilt 
under Superfund.</ul>
<P>
The EPA's main criteria for assigning liability for a Superfund site often seems to merely be "deep pockets" 
-- whoever is able to pay will pay for a site clean up.  Of course, this is not an ironclad rule.  After all, 
sometimes deep pockets cannot be found, in which case anyone will do -- including small businesses with 
the most distant relationship to the site.  And even if the EPA finds "deep pockets," these same "deep 
pockets" seek to recover their own costs by bringing contribution suits against these same small enterprises.
<P>
In addition, the type of waste disposed of at a site by a firm is far too often not factored into this liability 
scheme.  So a firm depositing fairly innocuous materials may still be held liable.  Indeed, the actual degree 
of risk for damaging exposure to hazardous wastes hardly plays into the determination process for a 
Superfund site at all.  James Bovard notes, "A study by the Congressional Office of Technology 
Assessment concluded that half of all Superfund cleanups 'address hypothetical risks rather than actual 
ones.'"7 
<P>
Also, the degree of cleanliness required by the EPA often falls far beyond the realm of common sense.  For 
example, waste sites need to be cleaned to "background conditions," far in excess of human safety 
requirements and beyond prevailing conditions prior to contamination; groundwater under a site must be 
made clean enough to drink (often technologically impossible); and dirt is required to be so clean that a 
person could eat (!) half a teaspoon every month for 76 years and not get cancer.8  
<P>
If you think such a system possesses enormous potential to develop into a costly, legal quagmire, you are 
absolutely correct.
<P>
<hr>
<H3><CENTER><a name="six">Superfund's Toxic Effects -- 
Dismal Results at Staggering Costs</a></CENTER> </H3>

As is the case with so many federal government endeavors, Superfund has fallen far short of its original 
goals while generating a host of new ills.  And these ills are felt by individuals and enterprises caught in the 
Superfund web, taxpayers, entire industries, and the economy in general.  
<P>
The overall costs are weighty:
<ul><p>
<li> Of the 1,292 "worst" waste sites on the NPL, only 237 have been cleaned up -- about 18 percent -- 
according to Heritage Foundation analyst John Shanahan.9  One should note that this is a most optimistic 
accounting of cleaned up sites.  On February 14, 1994, for example, Business Week reported that out of 
1,270 sites on the Superfund list just 49 "have been completely cleaned up."

<li> Yet, the federal government has spent almost $10 billion on Superfund and forced private parties to kick 
in another $80 billion.10  The average NPL site takes 10 years to clean up at an average cost of $30 
million, according to economist James Bovard.11  However, on September 29, 1995, The Washington 
Times reported it generally takes 8 years for clean up to actually begin, and then another 12 to 15 years to 
clean up the site.

<li> On average, transaction costs account for 32 percent of total private-sector Superfund costs, with 
litigation making up 65 percent of this amount or 21 percent of total costs.12  As reported in a recent 
Investor's Business Daily article (September 29, 1995), U.S. Representatives Mike Oxley (R-OH) and 
Sherwood Boelhert (R-NY) claim that as much as one-third of Superfund money pays for legal fees alone.

<li> Once caught in the Superfund liability morass, it becomes much more difficult for a firm to attract 
capital, make investments, and therefore, grow and create jobs.  Superfund's strict, retroactive, and joint 
and several liabilities create considerable uncertainties for firms.  Such unknown costs chase away 
investors and make expansion plans quite dubious.
<P></ul>
Small businesses suffer most under these added costs and risks.  Without the Superfund cloud hanging over 
it, investing in, starting up, and expanding a small venture is already a risky undertaking.  Superfund 
liabilities only raise the hurdles faced by small business even higher.
<P>
A survey of small businesses conducted by the American Council for Capital Formation confirmed these 
facts.  In a January 1994 report, it was noted that 39.1 percent of small business respondents reduced or 
delayed investment in plant and equipment due to being named a PRP.  Almost half of respondents with 0-
19 employees canceled or postponed investment.
<P>
The blow to the economy and job creation from this reduced investment are manifest.
<ul><p>
<li> Superfund also creates disincentives for investment in industrialized urban areas.  The threat of enormous 
liability discourages firms from buying land in and renewing long-time or formerly industrialized areas.  
Instead, it's safer to build new facilities elsewhere.  So many U.S. cities already impose large burdens on 
the private sector -- including high taxes, heavy regulations, bloated government budgets, and more -- and 
Superfund adds to these costs.

<li> Incentives are skewed for local governments and communities as well.  With the federal government and 
private parties picking up the tab for a Superfund site clean up, localities possess every incentive to push 
for clean ups to go well beyond reasonable levels.  They are not restrained by cost concerns, as someone 
else foots the bill. Economist Robert Hahn has noted that local communities often seek "gold-plated" clean 
ups as they reap nearly all the benefits while the costs are swallowed by a large number of taxpayers and 
consumers.13  Only when localities are named as PRPs does one witness restraint.

<li> Finally, according to a study by the Center for the Study of American Business, "Superfund imposes 
much more stringent regulations on manufacturing and other firms doing business in the United States than 
these companies would be required to meet in other countries."14  Most notably, in nations like Canada, 
Mexico, Germany, Japan, Great Britain, and others, liability rarely reaches entities that legally disposed of 
their waste; instead, liability is linked to fault.15  
<p></ul>
Individual Superfund horror stories abound, and the most horrific tend to pertain to small businesses -- 
those least able to afford or survive a governmental assault of the Superfund magnitude.  For example:
<p><ul>
<li> A small camera and film-developing store reportedly was held liable for the massive clean-up costs of a 
Superfund site in Glenwood Landing, New York.16 

<li> Hundreds of businesses and nonprofit groups, including a hospital, several public schools, and a pizza 
parlor, have been forced to pay large costs for cleaning up the Ludlow Sanitary Landfill in New York.17  
Bob Novak, owner of the Jolly Butcher Shop, had to fork over $11,000, originally destined for store 
improvements, because the glue from cardboard boxes he shipped to Ludlow was deemed hazardous.18  

<li> Formal Ware Rental Services of Tulsa, Oklahoma was notified by the EPA that it would be held 
responsible for the clean up of a local Superfund site.  Why?  Apparently for nothing more than paying 
someone $14 in 1972 to haul trash to the site.19

<li> Robert M. Cox Jr. lost his business because the Superfund liability scheme forced him to pay for the 
neglect of others.  He had to sell his furniture coating business -- Gilbert Spruance Co. of Oreland, 
Pennsylvania -- due to excessive legal fees and liability costs.  His waste had been disposed of at 11 
different sites despite an agreement with a waste hauler for disposal in one landfill.20  

<li>Kaplan's Careful Cleaners of Camp Hill, Pennsylvania was held liable for waste deposited according to 
the "letter of the law" 10 years ago at a site now on the Superfund list.21  

<li> H. Petert Nerger, president of Marisol Inc. of Middlesex, New Jersey, reported recently that even though 
his solvent recycling operations have not generated any wastes since the 1984 land ban under the Resource 
Conservation and Recovery Act, and despite the fact that previously the state told him where to deposit his 
waste, "our existence is threatened by retroactive liability."22  

<li> Automobile dealers in the Fresno, California area have become victims of what can be termed "drive by 
liability."  EPA bureaucrats reportedly put a former truck driver behind the wheel of a car and asked him to 
select establishments where he picked up used oil in the past and how much.23  

<li> In 1987, Eugene Ardelt bought the Mesa Fiberglass Products Company and soon after became a PRP at 
the Lowery Landfill Superfund site in Denver.  It did not matter that Ardelt had never dumped toxic waste 
at the landfill, nor that the previous owner's dumping was perfectly legal.  Ardelt spent $25,000 in legal 
fees and eventually settled with the EPA for $2,000.24  

<li> A small chemical company in Massachusetts -- Nyacol Products Inc. -- is being held as a PRP at the 
Nyanza Chemical Waste Dump Superfund Site because it currently owns the property.  This despite the 
fact that the EPA acknowledges that Nyacol had nothing at all to do with the site's contamination.25 
</ul><p>
These few examples fail to even scratch the surface.  Stories of Superfund atrocities seem endless.  And 
one should remember that while the costs are high for individuals and the economy, the safety benefits 
derived by individuals and improvements to the environment remain in question.  No one wins under the 
Superfund scenario of high costs and few clean ups.
<p>
<hr>
<H3><CENTER><a name="seven">Department of Justice Defends 
Superfund Injustice</a></CENTER>
</H3>
It is worth examining the arguments made by Superfund's supporters.  These were most recently 
encapsulated on October 19, 1995, when Assistant Attorney General Lois J. Schiffer from the 
Environmental and Natural Resources Division of the U.S. Department of Justice testified regarding 
Superfund before the House of Representatives Committee on Small Business.  In general, Ms. Schiffer 
found little fault with Superfund.  
<P>
Indeed, Schiffer declared: "We believe that the Superfund liability and enforcement scheme has been very 
effective in carrying out the 'polluter pays' principle. "  As with all supporters of Superfund, Schiffer 
throws around the term "polluter" in a reckless manner.  No consideration is given to the intent of 
individuals and the legality of their actions.  If a small business owner disposed of a small amount of waste 
in a completely legal and ethical manner, for example, he becomes a "polluter" when Superfund is invoked.
<P>
Later in her testimony, Ms. Schiffer paints a picture of a government agency working with the private 
sector in full cooperation: "During the 15 years of its existence, the enforcement program has evolved from 
a litigation focus into a program in which most responsible parties enter into settlements or voluntarily 
comply with administrative orders, rather than litigating with the government."  Of course, mention of 
harsh EPA fines and threats of holding particular parties responsible for the entire clean up of a waste site 
go unmentioned.
<P>
Schiffer also praised a 1986 change in Superfund legislation which according to the Assistant Attorney 
General "prevents responsible parties from delaying cleanups by seeking judicial review and stays of EPA's 
remedies or orders before the government seeks judicial enforcement."  Of course, if one is on the 
receiving end of such "remedies or orders" the story can be quite different.  In testimony also given on 
October 19, John B. DeVinck, a car dealer from Superior Wisconsin, offered a slightly different assessment 
of restrictions on PRPs:
<P>
"My dealership arranged to transport used oil to [the Arrowhead Refining Company site] during a single 
nine-month period in 1976 when my regular used oil company was on strike.  I did not send used oil to 
Arrowhead during any other period of time, and have witnesses and sworn affidavits attesting to that fact.  
Regrettably, EPA and the PRP group who sued me refused to accept my supporting evidence and the 
testimony of witnesses.  With no jury or other fact finding on the EPA's part and no documentary records 
or evidence, they calculated the maximum amount of oil each dealership generated and assumed it was sent 
to Arrowhead during its 1944-77 operating life, assessing liability based on that maximum amount."
<P>
It was decided that DeVinck sent 31,855 gallons over the period 1960 to 1976.  Based on his own samples 
from various years, DeVinck calculated that over the actual nine months he sent his used oil to Arrowhead, 
he was responsible for about 1,000 gallons.  He has been involved in the PRP process for over five years 
now.  His costs include more than $100,000 in attorney and consultant fees, liability finally set at $70,000 
(down from an original "guess-timate" of $460,000 and then $230,000), plus $8,000 in interest.
<P>
In closing his testimony, DeVinck noted: "In my case, the $78,000 of cleanup liability I was assessed is an 
absolute travesty of justice.  The problem was that I couldn't prove a negative.  It was impossible to prove 
that I didn't contribute the huge amounts of used oil alleged."
<P>
Assistant Attorney General Schiffer also praised the fact that the 1986 Superfund amendments directed the 
EPA to select more "permanent" clean up remedies.  Of course, in many instances, this increases the cost of 
clean ups.  Federal lawmakers and bureaucrats clearly should not be dictating how far a clean up must go; 
this should be left to localities and the states who have a better understanding of local communities.
<P>
Some Superfund proponents have argued that Superfund was needed to establish a liability structure for 
cleaning up waste sites.  In fact, in her testimony, Schiffer inadvertently shows that no such need existed: 
"Before 1980, there was liability for contamination caused by hazardous waste disposal under the common 
law of public nuisance" and even strict liability "for harm caused by ultrahazardous activities."  She 
asserted that Superfund "was needed to provide response authority and funding for cleaning up hazardous 
waste sites, and to make rules of liability consistent and clear on a national basis."  With common law 
precedence and state or local government action possible, however, the need for federal action did not, and 
does not, exist.
<P>
Ms. Schiffer justified each aspect of Superfund's strict, retroactive, and joint and several liability scheme, 
as noted below.  Any true defender of justice should be disturbed by these justifications.  A response is 
supplied to each major justification for Superfund's liability regime offered by the Assistant Attorney 
General: 
<P><ul>
<li> Schiffer went so far as to justify strict liability under Superfund because, "Litigating 'fault,' as in tort 
cases, is extremely time-consuming and resource-intensive."  
Response.  According to the Assistant Attorney General's testimony, under strict and joint and several 
liabilities, justice seems to be sacrificed for governmental expediency.  This would be bad enough, 
however, in reality under Superfund, justice is sacrificed for absolutely no expediency whatsoever.  Clean 
ups take more than 10 years on average to be completed, while litigation costs skyrocket. 

<li> Retroactive liability rests, to say the least, on quite precarious grounds based on Schiffer's justifications: 
<p><ol><li> "it is perfectly fair to ask the parties who make a mess to clean it up;" <li> "the companies who created 
problems caused by Superfund sites benefitted economically from the manufacturing and other activities 
that generated these hazardous wastes;" and <li>"at least some of the companies who disposed of hazardous 
wastes were well aware of the dangers the wastes posed long before the public was."  <p></ol>
Response.  Schiffer's arguments supporting retroactive liability ignore the facts that entities not responsible, 
in any significant meaning of the word, are paying for cleaning up messes across the nation.  If economic 
benefit is a justification for retroactivity, then the retroactive liability net has to be cast much wider to 
capture consumers, various levels of government and taxpayers, other related businesses, etc.  And  if a 
handful of companies may have been aware of dangers the public was not, that is certainly no justification 
for punishing all businesses involved.  
<P>
<li> Finally, Schiffer argues that "joint and several liability is a longstanding common law rule that has been 
applied by the courts in CERCLA cases brought by the government, at sites where there is more than one 
responsible party and the harm is divisible."  She also asserted that joint and several liability is an efficient 
course of action, and if repealed would increase litigation costs.<P>
Response.  As for joint and several liability, Schiffer cites a supporting case -- Summers v. Tice, 33 Cal. 2d 
80 (Sup. Ct. Cal. 1948).  However, she notes that the defendants in this case actually "acted wrongfully."  
To say that a small business disposing waste according to the letter of the law and in good conscience is in 
any way acting wrongfully is a clear perversion of the law.
<P></ul>
When these shaky arguments are the best that can be mustered in defense of Superfund, serious questions 
should arise in everyone's minds -- especially our federal elected officials.
<p>
<hr>
<H3><CENTER><a name="eight">What To Do?</a></CENTER></H3>

As we have seen, Superfund's problems are numerous and substantial.  In this booklet's introduction, it was 
noted that disagreement exists as to whether Superfund was in need of merely some fine tuning, a complete 
overhaul, or outright termination.
<p>
The long and costly list of problems identified here safely rules out mere fine tuning.  Economics and 
common sense dictate termination of Superfund, but politics may require something short of that -- a 
complete overhaul.  The following reform measures are offered as a three-step process:<p><ol><li> short-term 
reforms, <li> a major overhaul of Superfund, and <li> Superfund's termination.</ol><p>
<hr>
<H3><CENTER><a name="nine">1) Short-term Superfund Reform Measures</a></CENTER>
</H3>
In order to get the Superfund reform process moving, several steps can be taken immediately that create a 
somewhat saner environment.  These include repealing retroactive liability for all actions taken before 
1987 -- eliminating litigation at an estimated 80 percent of Superfund sites; from 1987 on, basing liability 
on the proportion of waste a party contributed to a site; using science-based risk assessment and cost-
benefit analysis to determine required clean up remedies; and capping the number of Superfund NPL sites 
to gain some control over potential costs.

<hr>
<H3><CENTER><a name="ten">2) Completely Overhauling Superfund</a></CENTER>
</H3>
The following reforms would go far in overhauling the Superfund program:<ul>

<li> Completely repeal strict, retroactive, and joint and several liability schemes.  Fairness and common sense 
dictate that no one should be held liable for exercising good judgment and following the law, and certainly 
not for actions taken before a law was passed.

<li> Superfund should only assign liability to individuals and businesses who broke the law, who were 
negligent, fraudulent, deceptive , etc.  This is the only true "polluter pays" scenario.  To reiterate, parties 
that simply sent waste to a site in an honest manner, in full compliance with the law, should have 
absolutely no liability whatsoever.  In essence, they are not polluters.  So even proportional liability 
reforms -- where liability is determined by the amount and type of waste an enterprise contributed to the 
site -- while improvements over the current system, still remain fundamentally unfair and must eventually 
give way.
</ul>
If the federal government insists on operating a Superfund program, based on the dubious belief that 
individual waste sites amount to a federal issue, then funding should be attained from true polluters, and 
where no real polluters can be found, unfortunately, through federal taxes.  However, in the end, more 
needs to be done than a complete overhaul of Superfund.  Federal taxpayers should not have to pay for 
local waste sites.
<p>
<hr>
<H3><CENTER><a name="eleven">3. The Case for Terminating Superfund</a></CENTER></H3>

In fact, a waste site clean up is not a federal issue, unless, of course,  operated by the federal government or 
undertaken due to a new federal law or mandate.  In these two instances, federal responsibility is clear.  
Otherwise, waste site clean ups should be left as local, or at most,  state issues.  Localities are in a better 
position to judge the costs and benefits of clean ups.  If completely unable to carry the costs of a necessary 
clean up, then state government should be turned to for assistance.    
<P>
In fact, state and local clean-up efforts have proved to be far more efficient, timely, and less costly.  Local 
individuals possess a better understanding of their community's circumstances and needs than do EPA 
bureaucrats.
<P>
Indeed, the proper order of responsibility -- again,  barring federal operation, mandates or laws --  should 
be:
<P><ol>
<li>Private parties guilty of breaking the law, negligence, fraud, etc.;
<li>Local government action;
<li>State government action.
</ol><p>
The case for terminating the federal Superfund program is strong, especially at a time when Congress is 
seeking to re-establish a proper relationship between federal, state, and local governments.  True federalism 
dictates that those issues that can be dealt with at the state or local level should be left at the state or local 
level.  Not that these particular governmental layers are necessarily any more efficient than the federal 
government, but state or local officials should possess some better understanding of a community's needs, 
including the area of a waste-site clean up.
<p>
In the end, Superfund should be discontinued and the several taxes supporting it terminated.  This is the 
most responsible step the federal government can take when it comes to waste sites across the nation.

<I><B>According to Congressional Ratings of Small Business

</B></I></CENTER>
<P>
Washington, D.C. -- Pundits in the media continue to speculate
about Democrats regaining control of the Congress.  The Small
Business Survival Committee (SBSC) also toyed with the idea to
determine how small business issues would fare under the specter
of what could be ultra-liberal leadership in Congress if the House
and Senate change hands this November.<BR>

<P>
&quot;We're toast,&quot; said SBSC President Karen Kerrigan. 
&quot;I shudder when I think about the possibility of certain
ranking committee chairman taking control of the key tax writing
and regulatory committees.  The 105th Congress would be an unabashed
adversary of business and taxpayer interests,&quot; she said.
<BR>

<P>
According to <I>SBSC's Ratings of the 104th Congress</I>, the
leadership and ranking members slated for committee chairmanship
if the Democrats take control in the House are classified in the
hostile category.  The average score of these possible chairmen
and the party's leadership is an abysmal 2.3% out of 100%.  A
list of those members and their respective SBSC rating are as
follows:<BR>

<P>
<I><B>Average SBSC Rating        2.3%<BR>
</B></I>
<P>
The average rating of current committee chairmen in the House
is 86.4%.  In the Senate, where long-time foes of small business
like Senator Ted Kennedy would chair the Labor and Human Resource
Committee if Democrats took control, the current SBSC average
is 80%.<BR>
<P>
According to SBSC, the ratings of committee chairmen are very
important because individuals in these powerful positions determine
the legislative agenda of the committee.  They can advance proposals
that either hurt or help small businesses and entrepreneurs.<BR>
<P>
&quot;If Democrats take control they will owe, big time, the special
interests groups that spent hundreds of millions of dollars to
buy back the majority,&quot; said Kerrigan.  These groups -- big
labor, radical environmentalists, and other members of the more
spending/ big government coalition -- would expect the Democrats
to implement their far left agenda.  That agenda, consisting of
higher taxes, government-run health care and a massive expansion
of the regulatory state, would disproportionately fall on small
businesses according to SBSC.<BR>

<CENTER><B>COMMEMORATING ANNIVERSARY OF CLINTON TAX ADMISSION
<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
<B>WASHINGTON, D.C. </B>--  President Clinton returned to Houston,
Texas, today approaching the one year anniversary of his repentant
statement about the 1993 tax hike:<BR>
<P>
<B>&quot;Probably there are people in this room, still mad at
me at that budget because you think I raised your taxes too much.
 It might surprise you to know that I think I raised them too
much too.&quot; -- Bill Clinton, at a Houston fund-raiser, October
17, 1995.<BR>
</B>
<P>
Bill Clinton first claimed he was a tax cutter.  Then he launched
the single largest tax increase in American history, $265 billion.
 He said he would cut taxes on the middle-class.  Instead, he
hit middle-class small business owners with a punishing tax increase.
<BR>
<P>
&quot;Bill Clinton is a proven tax-cut dodger,&quot; said Karen
Kerrigan, President, Small Business Survival Committee, a Washington,
D.C.-based small business advocacy organization.  &quot;In 1992,
he convinced American taxpayers that he's a tax cutter.  He told
them that he is their friend and with him at the helm of government
economic relief would be arriving in the form of a tax cut.  After
he got in office, he felt our pain by delivering a body blow to
the American taxpayer in the form of a $265 billion tax increase.
 The largest tax increase in history and one that bludgeoned small
businesses!&quot;<BR>
<P>
Bill Clinton now wants us to believe that he won't raise taxes
in a second term.  He told CBS's <I>60</I> <I>Minutes</I>, &quot;I'm
willing to pledge right now that I, I have no intention of raising
taxes.&quot;  (8/18/96)<BR>
<P>
In 1992 Bill Clinton's intention was to cut taxes.  Now his intention
is not to raise them.  Bill Clinton reminded us all that &quot;Fool
me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me.&quot;  (10/28/92).
 Bill Clinton is a tax and spend liberal.  In his second term
he will raise taxes.  If the American taxpayer liked Clinton's
&quot;middle-class tax relief,&quot; they'll love his &quot;targeted
tax cuts.&quot;  Certainly small businesses won't be fooled by
more election-year promises by a proven tax hiker.
<P>
   
<P>
Back in Houston, President Clinton needs to be reminded that once
he was right.  &quot;I raised [taxes] too much...&quot;<BR>
<BR>

<CENTER>Small Business Says Thank You to 104th<BR>
</CENTER>
</b>
<hr>
<P>
Washington, D.C. -- The Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC)
today joined a coalition of taxpayer, consumer and senior organizations
to express their thanks to the 104th Congress.  SBSC is specifically
gratified for initiatives undertaken and passed to help entrepreneurs
and small businesses.<BR>
<P>
&quot;Looking back at the last two years, the 104th Congress passed
historical measures to help small business and promote entrepreneurship,&quot;
said SBSC President Karen Kerrigan.<BR>
<P>
The &quot;Salute to the 104th Congress&quot; event was held on
Capitol Hill today to thank Members both individually and collectively
for their bold steps to help protect entrepreneurs and encourage
small business start-ups.  SBSC joined Americans for Tax Reform,
Citizens Against Government Waste, Seniors Coalition, Chamber
of Commerce and other groups in sponsoring the event.  House Speaker
Newt Gingrich and other members of the House leadership were on
hand to address those attending the recognition ceremonies.<BR>
<P>
SBSC praised Republican-led reforms which were signed by the President.
 They also thanked Congress for passing a comprehensive small
business agenda yet vetoed by Clinton.  Among the reforms passed
by the House and either vetoed or opposed by the President:  capital
gains tax reduction, estate tax reform, comprehensive regulatory
relief, legal reform, the TEAM Act and property rights protection.
<BR>
<P>
&quot;While we are pleased that President Clinton signed several
of the initiatives targeted to help small businesses, unfortunately
he vetoed or stood in the way of other reform priorities recommended
by his own White House Conference on Small Business,&quot; added
Kerrigan.<BR>
<P>
SBSC applauded the Congress for its passage of health insurance
reforms to help small business including the phasing-in of deductibility
to 80 percent, and passing Medical Savings Accounts.  In addition,
regulators are now more accountable to small businesses because
Congress put teeth into Regulatory Flexibility.  Regulators must
also publish their rules and regulations in &quot;Plain English&quot;
and Congress can now conduct a final review of regulations and
vote to reject them.<BR>
<P>
&quot;Most importantly, the 104th Congress began to chip away
at the old status quo through its cuts in wasteful government
spending to balance the budget.  The two words that were dropped
from President Clinton's vocabulary after the '92 elections were
'Balanced Budget' until the 104th Congress came to town,&quot;
remarked Kerrigan.<BR>
<P>
In conclusion, SBSC has given the 104th Congress high marks for
its bold agenda.  &quot;No big tax increases like 1993, no attempts
for a government take-over of the health care system and making
small businesses pay for it like 1994 -- the 104th Congress initiated
mostly positive steps to encourage job creation and small business
growth and start-ups,&quot; Kerrigan concluded.<BR>

<CENTER><B>Clinton Land Grab Called Shameful By Small Business
Group<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<hr>
<P>
Washington, D.C. -- Small Business Survival Committee
(SBSC) President Karen Kerrigan made the following statement in
response to President Clinton's election-year land grab of southern
Utah:<BR>
<P>
&quot;President Clinton is getting a little too generous
during this election season.  On the campaign trail he has been
promising cradle-to-grave programs while doling out pork in key
electoral battleground states.<BR>
<P>
But his generosity has gone a little too far this
week.  Knowing that Utah will not fall into the Democratic column,
he has conveniently sacrificed the property rights of voters in
the state to placate environmental groups that need a return on
investment for their election-year financial support.<BR>
<P>
By executive fiat, the President has blatantly circumvented
the Congress to create a national monument without regard to the
job impact such a move would have on Utah's residents.  President
Clinton has consulted only with environmentalists on the land-grab,
and has even ignored and usurped his own Interior Department.
<BR>
<P>
It is clear that if President Clinton is bold enough
to make such moves leading up to the November elections, a second
term in office would mean a severe erosion of already-endangered
private property rights.<BR>
<P>
Utah residents, lawmakers and businesses are capable
of environmental stewardship.  They do not need President Clinton
-- or his cash supporters in the environmental movement -- to
tell them how to run their state.&quot;<BR>
<P>
President Clinton used his powers under the Antiquities
Act of 1906 to proclaim that 1.8 million acres of Utah will be
given protected status as a national monument.

<P>
September 17, 1996<BR>
<P>
 Small Business Advocate Applauds Senate Labor &amp; Human Resource
Committee<BR>
<P>
Washington, D.C. -- Today, the Senate Labor and Human Resource
Committee is holding an oversight hearing of the National Labor
Relations Board.  In response to the hearing, Small Business Survival
Committee president, Karen Kerrigan, made the following statement:
<BR>
<P>
&quot;The Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC) calls on the
National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to cease its open agenda
of union activism, and to work toward balanced enforcement of
the labor laws.  Rather than acting as an objective and independent
agency, the NLRB has assumed the appearance of a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the AFL-CIO.<BR>
<P>
Since 1994, Clinton appointees to the National Labor Relations
Board have waged an unprecedented assault on small businesses.
 Most notoriously, the Board's proposed &quot;single location
bargaining unit rule&quot; would limit the rights of employers
while promoting unionization of small businesses.<BR>
<P>
Less well known but equally hostile to small business owners,
is the enforcement policy of the General Counsel.  The illicit
union tactics known as salting and corporate campaigns have been
tolerated and tacitly promoted by this Board.  Unions have been
able to wear down small businesses through the filing of frivolous
charges with the NLRB.  The agency has been quick to adopt novel
union theories of labor law violations, yet slow to dismiss even
the most baseless of charges against employers.  The result has
been exorbitant legal expenses, increased labor-management hostility,
and declining respect for this independent agency.<BR>
<P>
The public recognizes the importance of small business to the
economy, and to the lives of millions of working Americans.  The
public has the right to know of this government-endorsed program
of labor union promotion.  SBSC hails today's hearing of the Senate
Labor &amp; Human Resources Committee as the first step toward
ending the NLRB's assault on small business and its workers.&quot;

<hr>
<P>
Washington, D.C. -- The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) has
goals worth supporting, but in the end it will harm U.S. national
security while subjecting private industry -- many of which are
small businesses -- to onerous new regulatory burdens, on-site
inspections by a new foreign entity with the real potential for
international industrial espionage, according to a small business
watchdog group.  The U.S. Senate has scheduled a CWC ratification
vote on September 14.<BR>
<P>
&quot;Our assessment of the CWC is one of great apprehension and
concern for U.S. businesses.  We urge the U.S. Senate to take
a careful look at the treaty in terms of what American business
will be subjected to, and how our competitiveness is threatened
by new reporting requirements and on-site visits by Hague-based
foreign inspectors,&quot; commented Karen Kerrigan, President
of the Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC).<BR>
<P>
Nations that sign the CWC will agree to abide by the treaty whose
goals are to end the production and stockpiling of chemical weapons.
 Unfortunately, rogue nations like Iraq, Libya, Syria and North
Korea are not planning to sign the treaty.  Moreover, defense
and foreign policy experts view the CWC as non-enforceable and
non-verifiable.<BR>
<P>
As then-Director of the Central Intelligence Agency James Woolsey
stated before the Foreign Relations Committee in June of 1994:
  &quot;The chemical weapons problem is so difficult from an intelligence
perspective that I cannot state that we have high confidence in
our ability to detect noncompliance, especially on a  small scale.&quot;
<BR>
<P>
In order to comply with CWC provisions, new regulatory burdens
would be placed on already over-regulated U.S. businesses.  In
particular:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>U.S. private industry would be subjected to foreign inspections
at the direction of  Technical Secretariat overseeing the Organization
for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) located in the
Hague, Netherlands.
<LI>Businesses must prove to the U.S. government and international
inspectors that they are not producing or stockpiling chemical
weapons.  Chemical companies plus other businesses that use certain
chemicals in manufacturing processes must fill out new forms for
each chemical covered by the treaty.  Firms in food processing,
pharmaceutical, paint, petroleum, biotech, electronics, textiles,
rubber, brewing and distilling industries would be impacted as
well.
<LI>The. U.S. Department of Commerce estimates that it will take
anywhere from 2.5 - 9 hours to fill out the paperwork for each
chemical depending upon its classification.
<LI>Congress's Office of Technology Assessment estimated that
inspections will cost U.S. firms anywhere from $10,000 to $500,000
per visit.
<LI>Distinct possibilities exist that rights of due process could
be violated in relation to warrantless searches and personnel
being compelled to answer questions, and provide information and
access.
<LI>With the advent of foreign inspections, proprietary information
could be compromised hurting U.S. competitiveness.
</UL>
<P>
<P>
&quot;By all accounts the treaty is flawed, and we strongly urge
the U.S. Senate to take a sober look at the CWC.  We believe an
honest assessment of the treaty will reveal that the costs to
U.S. businesses, the loss of our economic freedom and compromising
constitutionally protected American rights do not justify ratification
-- especially with the prevalent belief that the treaty will harm
U.S. national security,&quot; said Kerrigan.<BR>

<b>Washington, D.C.</b> &#173;&#173; The Small Business Survival Foundation
(SBS Foundation) &#173;&#173; a nonpartisan research and education
organization focusing on public policy issues relating to small
business and entrepreneurship &#173;&#173; has called on candidates
to focus closely on the issues in this year's campaign.  To help
this process along, the Foundation re&#173;released its comprehensive
guide to issues impacting entrepreneurs and the economy &#173;&#173;
&quot;Entrepreneurs and Elections '96: A 
Candidate's Handbook to Critical Small Business Issues.&quot;
<P>
SBS Foundation President Karen Kerrigan declared: &quot;Entrepreneurs,
business 
owners, and their employees are looking for a substantive, issues&#173;based
campaign in 1996.  
<P>
&quot;Entrepreneurs and Elections '96&quot; will help candidates
at both the federal and state levels, 
as well as the media and citizens in general, to sort through
the real issues affecting small 
business, entrepreneurship, and the economy.&quot;<BR>
<P>
SBS Foundation Chief Economist Raymond J. Keating, author of &quot;Entrepreneurs
and Elections '96,&quot; echoed these comments by noting, &quot;As
the campaign season moves 
into high gear, the tendency increases for rhetoric to overwhelm
substance.  Our 
&quot;Entrepreneurs and Elections '96&quot; booklet attempts to
keep attention and offer guidance on 
substantive issues.&quot;<BR>
<P>
Each chapter in &quot;Entrepreneurs and Elections '96&quot;deals
with important public 
policies and how they impact entrepreneurs and the economy &#173;&#173;
tax policy, government 
spending, regulations, monetary policy, trade, immigration, health
care, government 
reform, as well as key issues at the state and city levels.  The
booklet also examines the role 
of small business and entrepreneurship in today's economy and
over the next century.    
<P>
Keating concluded: &quot;Our economy has been growing at a slow&#173;to&#173;mediocre
pace 
since the late 1980s and we need to be debating policy options
that will place the economy 
on a high&#173;growth track.  Of course, real economic growth
and job creation are generated 
through investment and entrepreneurship.  &quot;Entrepreneurs
and Elections '96&quot; offers an 
entrepreneur&#173;friendly agenda.&quot;

<b>Washington, D.C.</b> &#173;&#173; To mark the start of
National Small Business Week, the Small Business Survival Foundation
&#173;&#173; a nonpartisan, nonprofit research and education organization
focusing on small business issues &#173;&#173; released a new
report today the &quot;Small Business Survival Index: Ranking
the Environment for Entrepreneurship Across the Nation.&quot;
<BR>

<P>
Raymond J. Keating, chief economist for the Small
Business Survival Foundation 
and author of the report, noted: &quot;The Small
Business Survival Index provides a measure of 
government&#173;related costs affecting the decisions
of investors, entrepreneurs, and businesses &#173;
&#173; the engines of economic growth and job creation.&quot;<p>
 The study combines nine major costs 
(whether rates, ratios, or indexes) levied on small
businesses and entrepreneurs into one 
comparative index number:<BR>

<P>
<B>Top
Personal Income Tax Rate</B>.  State personal income tax rates
impact economic 
decision&#173;making related to working, saving,
investing, and risk taking. 
<P>
<B>Top
Individual Capital Gains Tax Rate</B>.  State capital gains taxes
are direct levies on 
investment and entrepreneurship &#173;&#173; the
sources of growth in the economy.  
<P>
<B>Top
Corporate Income Tax Rate.</B>  State corporate income tax rates
affect a broad range of 
business decisions &#173;&#173; most clearly decisions
relating to investment and location.
<P>
<b>Property
Taxes (per $100 of personal income).</B>
State and local property taxes impact 
decisions as to where businesses and entrepreneurs
choose to locate, as well as decisions 
relating to investments in facilities.
<P>
<B>Sales
Taxes (per $100 of personal income)</B>.  State and local sales
taxes impact the
economic decisions of individuals and families, as
well as various retail businesses.
<P>
<B>Death
Taxes</B>.  Estate taxes amount to nothing more than a government
hostile takeover of 
a business at the time of the owner's death and impact
investment and location decisions.
<P>
<B>Top
Unemployment Tax Rate Paid by Employers on Taxable Wages</B>.
 The unemployment
tax rate on taxable wages affects labor&#173;versus&#173;capital
as well as location decisions.
<P>
<B>Workers'
Compensation Costs (cost index)</B>.  High workers' compensation
rates also 
impact labor&#173;versus&#173;capital and location
decisions.
<P>
<B>Total
Crime Rate</B>.  Just like taxes, a high crime rate acts as a
disincentive to entrepreneurs, 
who naturally seek out environments where life and
property are protected.  <BR>

<P>
Keating acknowledged that other obstacles are placed
in the path of entrepreneurs 
and businesses at the state and local levels, particularly
regulations.  Unfortunately, no 
reliable, comparative measure for state and/or local
regulatory costs is currently available.  
<P>
<B>Under the Small Business Survival Index, the lower
the index number, the lighter the </B>
<B>governmental burdens, and the better the environment
is for risk taking. 
</B>

<P>
Karen Kerrigan, president of the Small Business Survival
Foundation, noted: 
&quot;According to our Index, South Dakota, Wyoming,
Nevada, and Washington rate best for 
entrepreneurs because they don't tax personal income,
capital gains, or corporate income.  
Texas, New Hampshire, Tennessee, Alaska, and Florida
rank very high as well.  
<P>
Unfortunately, places like Minnesota, New Mexico,
Maine, Montana, Vermont, New York 
State, Iowa, Hawaii, California, and Rhode Island
treat job&#173;creating entrepreneurs and 
small business owners rather shabbily.&quot;  <BR>

<P>
Keating added: &quot;The District of Columbia ranks
as most hostile to entrepreneurship 
when compared to the 50 states.  However, if you
add New York City into the mix, it 
offers the worst environment for entrepreneurship
&#173;&#173; by far.  For entrepreneurs, the Big 
Apple is rotten.&quot;  <BR>

<b>Washington, D.C.</b> -- The Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC)
-- a nationwide, nonpartisan small business advocacy organization
-- today released a statement regarding the observance of Small
Business Week.  SBSC President Karen Kerrigan prepared the following
statement:<BR>
<P>
&quot;Every year small businesses and entrepreneurs become more
vital to the growth and dynamism of the U.S. economy.  Small businesses
and entrepreneurs are the risk-takers and chief job producers
of America, and without their activity our economy would stagnate
and ultimately deteriorate.  National Small Business Week commemorates
the sacrifices made by entrepreneurs, and gives politicians the
opportunity to talk about the sacrifices they've made for small
business.<BR>
<P>
The United States truly is the land of opportunity and entrepreneurship.
 Between 1970 and 1991, the number of sole proprietorships increased
from 5.7 million to 15.2 million -- an increase of 167%.  It is
interesting to note that as over 500,000 Americans lost their
jobs due to downsizing in 1994 (according to the U.S. Bureau of
Labor Statistics), new business incorporations skyrocketed to
a record 750,000 in the same year.  Not surprisingly, more Americans
are taking advantage of technological advances and economic trends
to start their own business.  They have no interest in &quot;corporate
responsibility,&quot; but rather creating their own long-term
economic security.<BR>
<P>
It is essential that elected officials recognize the strong economic
forces that will dominate the 21st Century workforce -- trends
that Senator Connie Mack's Joint Economic Committee fittingly
describe as a workforce controlled by diversity, mobility and
entrepreneurship.  Though these trends have been identified by
the 104th Congress -- with scores of proposals offered to take
advantage of our exciting economic future -- the agenda of growth
and entrepreneurship has been vehemently rejected by President
Clinton.<BR>
<P>
President Clinton has been given sufficient opportunity to support
the entrepreneur's agenda, but through the use of his veto pen
and through countless policies passed and presented by his Administration
-- he has decided to support and advance a European model that
mistakenly places the government at the center of the economy.
<BR>
<P>
President Clinton likes to claim that he's tough on crime and
criminals.  What is more evident, however, is that he has gotten
even tougher on innocent small business owners.  In fact, &quot;Three
Strikes You're Out&quot; -- the trendy slogan for various tough-on-crime
proposals --  is now an appropriate label for President Clinton's
small business record.<BR>
<P>
What are those strikes against the Administration?  STRIKE #1:
 The 1993 Clinton tax hike.  Touted as a soak-the-rich scheme,
small businesses took a bath on  the 'I feel your pain' increase.
 According to the IRS, 70% of those impacted by the hike were
small businesses.  A 1994 Small Business Survival Committee survey
of small businesses revealed that 69% of respondents took some
action in response to the Clinton tax hike.  STRIKE #2:  The Clinton
Health Care Plan.  Adorned with its proposed employer mandates
as the primary mechanism to achieve 'universal coverage,' the
plan would have been devastating to our nation's small businesses.
 Mrs. Clinton claimed that she could not be held responsible for
&quot;every undercapitalized entrepreneur in America,&quot; and
no one asked her to be.  Small businesses want to succeed or fail
on their own, but without the government as a &quot;silent partner&quot;
forcing them into collapse.  STRIKE #3:  The minimum wage hike.
 President Clinton used to be against the wage hike as a &quot;New
Democrat,&quot; but that was before the labor unions took over
his election-year agenda.  The Clinton wage hike is another silly
ploy to appease his boisterous left-wing at the expense of small
business owners.<BR>
<P>
Of course, President Clinton has also vetoed many of the important
reforms recommended by his own White House Conference on Small
Business (WHCSB).  The President has opposed practical and moderate
reforms at OSHA and EPA; securing property rights; reforming outdated
labor laws and <U>repealing</U> Davis-Bacon; giving small business
Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs) in health care reform, to name
a few items.  The WHCSB recommended, but the President promptly
<U>vetoed: </U> an increase in small business expensing; capital
gains tax reduction; estate tax reform; tax equity in health care
reform; pension reform; and tort reform -- all important to small
business growth and survival.<BR>
<P>
President Clinton will make every attempt this week to talk about
how friendly he has been to small businesses, and they will be
rightly incensed by his crass election-year rhetoric.  Moving
bureaucrats around agencies like pawns on a chessboard does not
help the entrepreneur's bottom-line.  &quot;Reinventing Government&quot;'
schemes have not lifted the paperwork and regulatory burden on
small businesses.  Conversely, increasing taxes and regulations
only serve to hurt entrepreneurship and economic growth.<BR>
<P>
President Clinton's track record on small business speaks louder
than his words.  Indeed he has embraced an economic model placing
government at the center of the economy.  The opening exists,
therefore, for a certain White House challenger to expose the
President's bias against small businesses and offer an agenda
that properly places the entrepreneur at the economy's center
--  producing a dynamic and exciting economy offering opportunity
for those who seek the path of entrepreneurship.  A Presidential
candidate who advocates this agenda would truly make National
Small Business Week, a week to celebrate.&quot;<BR>

<b>Washington, D.C.</b> - Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC) President
Karen Kerrigan today released the following statement after the
United States House of Representatives increased the starting
wage: <BR>
<P>
&quot;Small businesses are the job creating engines of the United
States - making up nearly two-thirds of American businesses. 
Mandating the wage hike would effectively throw a monkey wrench
in that engine. The wage hike amounts to an unfunded mandate.
 As such, it should not make its way out of Washington.  And without
a doubt, small businesses will shoulder most of the cost of mandate.
To offset the cost of the wage hike, small business owners will
either be forced to reduce current employee hours, forgo hiring
additional workers, or raise the prices of goods and services.
 All of these consequences -- viewed by us as anti-worker -- 
will not put more money in the pockets of minimum wage workers.
The wage hike gives President Clinton a chance to again say 'I
feel your pain' during this election year.  But every time the
President 'feels our pain,' his compassion is followed by another
blow to small businesses and entrepreneurs.  For the small business
sector, this false compassion has meant increased taxes and costs,
courtesy of Bill Clinton.&quot;  <BR>

Small Business Group Applauds 
General Tax Principle & Policies Offered By Kemp Commission
</h2>
<i>January 17, 1996		</i></center>

<HR>
<P>
<b>Washington, DC</b> -- The Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC) voiced its support 
today for the general guiding principles and policies for tax reform outlined by the<A href ="/taxcom"> National 
Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform,</a> or the Kemp Commission.  SBSC is a 
40,000-member small business organization advocating a free-market, pro-entrepreneur policy 
agenda.
<p>
SBSC President Karen Kerrigan observed: "Overhauling our nation's tax code stands as a 
top issue for the small business community.  The Kemp Commission has outlined what we 
believe are the basics of a flat tax that will serve to significantly boost the nation's economy."
<p>
SBSC saw particular merit in several of the Commission's suggestions: to impose just a 
single, low tax rate on income; to end double taxation of businesses and their owners; to permit 
expensing of investment outlays; to exclude the returns on saving from taxation; to require a 
two-thirds majority vote in Congress to raise the tax rate; and most importantly, to abolish the 
capital gains tax.  While the Commission recognized that estate and gift taxes make "little sense," 
SBSC would have liked a much clearer declaration for the elimination of all "death" taxes that 
prove particularly burdensome for family-owned businesses.
<p>
Raymond J. Keating -- chief economist for the SBSC and author of a booklet entitled 
"The Great Tax Debate: Making Sense of Competing Tax Plans" (published by SBS Foundation) 
-- was enthused by the fact that the Commission's principles and policies lined up closely to 
those outlined in "The Great Tax Debate."  A side-by-side comparison is provided below.
<p>
Keating declared: "We're very pleased to see that the Commission recognizes the critical 
role that entrepreneurship plays in the economy -- as the engine of growth and job creation -- and 
the enormous obstacle our current tax code is to investment and risk taking."
<p>
"The Kemp Commission's report is not long on details, however.  Now comes the heavy 
lifting of making detailed, principled tax overhaul a reality," concluded Kerrigan.
<p>
<P>
<P>
<h4>Kemp Commission</h4>

<ul><i>Six Points of Principle:</i>
<p>
<li>Economic growth through incentives to 
work save and invest.
<br>
<li>Fairness to all taxpayers.
<br>
  <li>Simplicity so that anyone can figure it out.
<br>
<li>Neutrality that lets people and not 
government make choices.
<br>
<li>Visibility to let people know the cost of 
government.
<br>
<li>Stability so people can plan for the future.</ul>
<p>
<UL><i>Six Points of Policy:</i>
<p>
<li>A single tax rate.
<br>
<li>A generous personal exemption to remove 
the burden on those least able to pay.
<br>
<li>Lower tax rates for American families.
<br>
<li>Ending biases against work, saving, and 
investment.
<br>
<li>Making the new tax system hard to 
change.
</ul>
<p>
<h4>The Great Tax Debate</h4>
<p>
<ul><i>Eight Principles of Sound Taxation:</i>
<P>
<li>Low Flat Tax to Promote Economic 
Growth -- the lower and more proportional, 
or flatter, the tax rate system the better.

<br>
<li>No Taxation of Capital -- taxing returns on 
investment and savings makes absolutely no 
economic sense.

<br>
<li>Inflation Factor -- the detrimental effects 
of inflation should be factored into any tax 
system's design.

<br>
<li>Clarity -- the clearer the tax system the 
better.  Taxes should be as obvious as 
possible.

<br>
<li>Simplicity -- tax payments should be made 
as easy and as simple as possible without 
any loss of clarity.

<br>
<li>Limited Bureaucracy and Intrusiveness  -- 
the fewer tax collectors and the more limited 
their powers the better.

<br>
<li>Minimize Incentives for Tax Avoidance  -- 
taxes should be low enough so as to not 
provide significant incentives for tax 
avoidance.

<br>
<li>No Additional Boost to Government 
Spending -- a tax system's design should not 
make it any easier for government to 
increase expenditures.
</ul>

<B>Small Business Group Blasts Minimum Wage Hike Proposal</B><P>

<i>December 8, 1995</i>		</center>

<HR>
<P>

<b>Washington, D.C.--</b>  The Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC)
 a 40,000 member small business advocacy group that promotes a
freemarket, proentrepreneur agenda  declared their disgust today
with President Clinton's efforts to further derail current budget
negotiations, and hurt small businesses and lowskilled and young
workers as well, by proposing a minimum wage increase in his latest
budget proposal.
<P>
The President's proposal would raise the current $4.25 rate to
$4.70 on July 1, 1996 and to $5.15 on July 1, 1997.
<P>
SBSC President Karen Kerrigan observed:  &quot;The minimum wage
is not a budget issue and should not be included in budget proposals
and negotiations.  More important, however, is the fact that the
President is offering, once again, a proposal that will hurt small
businesses by raising their costs.  The President seems intent
on not only delaying the completion of the federal government
budget, but on damaging the budgetary well-being of many small
enterprises.&quot;
<P>
Kerrigan added, &quot;It is obvious that the President added the
minimum wage hike -- a critical objective of labor unions -- into
the budget plan.  It represents his big payoff to big labor. 
He desperately needs their reelection support next year.&quot;
<P>
SBSC Chief Economist Raymond J. Keating added:  &quot;Increasing
the minimum wage makes no sense from an economics standpoint as
well.  Indeed, no selfrespecting economist would argue that a
minimum wage hike helps lowskilled, lowincome, young workers.
 In fact, study after study shows that these individuals are hurt
most by a minimum wage increase as their unemployment levels climb.&quot;
<P>
Keating continued, &quot;Work experience is crucial so that individuals
can gain marketable skills, learn the disciplines of the marketplace,
and advance in life.  Increasing the minimum wage denies these
experiences as young and lowskilled worker s are priced out of
the labor market. As government artificially boosts wages with
a minimum wage hike, employers seek out alternatives to hiring
young, lowskilled individuals.  The likelihood of falling prey
to the welfare state then naturally increases.
<P>
While a minimum wage increase might sound compassionate, in reality
it is another cruel blow by government leveled at the disadvantaged.&quot;
<P>
&quot;No one will gain from President Clinton's proposed increase
in the minimum wage,&quot; concludes Keating.  &quot;The budget
process will slow; small business costs will rise; and young and
lowskilled workers will suffer.&quot;

Small Business Group Documents Superfund as Highly Toxic For Entrepreneurs and Business</h2>

<P>
<blockquote>
<b>Washington, D.C.--</b>  The Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC)
 a 40,000member small business advocacy group that promotes a
freemarket, proentrepreneur agenda  released a report today highly
critical of the federal government Superfund program.  &quot;Highly
Toxic: The Superfund Assault on Common Sense, Business and Entrepreneurship&quot;
was written by SBSC Chief Economist Raymond J. Keating. 
<P>
U.S. Representative Bill Zeliff (RNH), a leader in Superfund reform
efforts and Chairman of the Small Business Survival Caucus, wrote
the foreword to the report.
<P>
&quot;Highly Toxic&quot; documents some of the history, the massive
costs and egregious inefficiencies of the Superfund program, which
was designed to help clean up hazardous waste sites across the
country.  Instead, according to the report, a mere 18 percent
of the worst waste sites have been cleaned up at a combined government/privatesector
cost of approximately $90 billion.
<P>
Keating declares: &quot;Superfund unleashed the bloated bureaucracy
and gross inefficiencies of the federal government on often unsuspecting
individual and businesses; turned essentially local or, at most,
state problems into national woes; set arbitrary and unattainable
criteria for compliance; sent legal costs skyrocketing; forced
many businesses to close their doors; reduced capital available
for investment in certain industries; restrained job growth; and
damaged U.S. international competitiveness.&quot;  &quot;Highly
Toxic&quot; fully explains and offers examples of each of these
Superfund consequences.
<P>
&quot;Superfund is riddled with problems,&quot; Keating notes,
&quot;but worst of all is its liability scheme.  Under Superfund's
strict, retroactive, and joint and  several liability, if a business
disposed of waste  toxic or nontoxic, large or insignificant amounts
 in good conscience and in complete accordance with the law, it
can still be held liable for the costs of cleaning up the disposal
site if it later became a Superfund site.  Notions of responsibility
and fairness mean absolutely nothing under Superfund.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Highly Toxic&quot; suggests phasing in a threestep reform
process for Superfund: 
<P>
1) repeal retroactive liability for all actions taken before 1987
 eliminating litigation at an estimated 80 percent of Superfund
sites, use sciencebased risk assessment and costbenefit analysis
to determine required clean up remedies, and cap the number of
Superfund sites to gain some control over costs; 
<P>
2) in the name of fairness and common sense, repeal the strict,
retroactive, and joint and several liability schemes altogether,
and only assign liability to individuals and businesses who broke
the law, who were negligent, fraudulent, deceptive, etc.; and

<P>
3) eventually put an end to Superfund  waste sites are local or,
at most, state issues, not federal.
<P>
Keating concludes:  &quot;At the very least, Superfund must be
completely overhauled. 
<P>
As things currently stand, no one wins under the Superfund scenario
of high costs and few clean ups.&quot;

Small Business Advocate Supports Return to Citizen Congress</h2>
<i>November 16, 1995</i>		</center>

<HR>
<P>
<B>Washington, D.C.</B> - The Small Business Survival Committee
(SBSC), a 40,000 member small business advocacy organization,
announced support for an effort to historically change Congress.
 SBSC president Karen Kerrigan voiced support for the Citizen
Congress Act and its sponsors - Representatives Mark Sanford and
Wayne Allard and Senator Bill Frist.
<P>
&quot;The American people are tired of business as usual in Washington,
D.C.  The failure to enact congressional term limits adds to the
importance of implementing a bold initiative such as the Citizen
Congress Act, which we hope will change the face of Washington,&quot;
remarked Kerrigan.
<P>
If enacted, an initiative such as the Citizen Congress Act will
help restore the faith of the American people in their elected
officials.  For too long, voters have been made promises while
important measures such as term limits and a Balanced Budget Amendment
have not materialized.  By eliminating perks and wasteful practices
from within, Congress can begin to reverse the empty rhetoric
of the past several years.
<P>
According to SBSC, Abolishment of the federal pension system,
banning franked mass mailings, no automatic pay increases, and
limited military aircraft travel are significant reforms which
reduce government spending.  At a time when the country's fiscal
condition is instable, there is little reason not to tighten Congress'
belt.
<P>
Because federal lawmakers have failed to implement the wishes
of the public in regards to term limits, the Citizen Congress
Act will remind Members of their responsibility to the public.
 Voters, particularly small business owners, want the Congress
to be more accountable in every regard.
<P>
&quot;The Citizen Congress Act symbolizes a time-honored American
virtue - self-sacrifice.  We encourage all Members of Congress
to support this important initiative,&quot; Kerrigan added.

</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<center><h3>News Release<P>
Reconciliation Bill's Capital Gains Tax Cuts Are Essential
to Entrepreneurship and Small Business Growth, Says Small Business
Advocacy Group</h3>
<i>November 16, 1995</i>		</center>
<P>
<B>Contact: Renee Stikes<br>
(202) 785-0238</b>
<HR>
<P>
<B>Washington, D.C.</B> -- The Small Business Survival Committee
(SBSC), a 40,000-member small business advocacy organization,
today praised the capital gains tax cutting measures recently
announced by the House and Senate budget conferees.
<P>
The tax package will cut capital gains taxes on individuals and
corporations $35.7 billion. This cut would be retroactive to January
1, 1995. Additionally, individuals and corporations would have
reduced capital gains tax rates for investment in qualified small
business stock. Although the package fails to index capital gains
taxes to inflation immediately, SBSC President Karen Kerrigan
stated that the country's weak to moderate growth would receive
a firm boost from the capital gains tax cutting measures.
<P>
&quot;Taxes on capital gains are perhaps the most regressive for
small businesses and entrepreneurs. High capital gains taxes prevent
many entrepreneurs from overcoming their number one obstacle to
start-up and growth -- access to capital,&quot; said Kerrigan.
<P>
Kerrigan, however, added &quot;In no way should Congress fail
to realize the importance of indexing capital gains for inflation.
The lack of indexation creates additional disincentives for investment
-- restraining small business growth and job creation -- we hope
indexation is addressed before 2001.&quot;
<P>
According to SBSC, after factoring for inflation, a nominal profit
on a transaction can turn out to be a real loss, yet the investor
still pays taxes on the nominal gains. These <I>real rates</I>
of capital gains taxation are severe impediments to keeping America's
economy vibrant and growing.
<P>
Kerrigan added that opponents who try to attempt to classify the
issue as one of rich vs. poor do not have a firm grasp of economics
and are ignoring the facts of who benefits from capital gains
reduction. According to 1992 IRS tax returns, 83% of those claiming
capital gains had total incomes of less than $100,000 -- 53% claiming
capital gains had total incomes of less than $50,000.
<P>
Most importantly, a capital gains tax reduction will strongly
benefit America's budding entrepreneurs and small businesses.
SBSC Chief Economist Raymond Keating adds, &quot;an inability
to stand by a cut in capital gains taxes would be a most damaging
blow to entrepreneurship, investment, and the economy.&quot;

Real World Investment Pros Scoff <br>
at Treasury Secretary Rubin's "Train Wreck" Scenario</h2>
<i>November 3, 1995</i>		</center>
<P>
<B>Contact: Renee Stikes<br>
(202) -785-0238</b>
<HR>
<P>
<b>Washington, D.C.</b> -- Several leading investment experts, members of the Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC) -- a 40,000 member nonprofit, nonpartisan advocacy organization -- predict that a failure to pass tax cuts and a balanced budget will do much more harm to financial markets than failing to pay interest and/or principle on U.S. Treasury securities.  In response to Treasury Secretary Rubin's debt limit "crisis," and White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta's remarks that Republicans will cause an earthquake in the financial markets due to the possibility of delay in raising the $4.9 trillion debt ceiling, SBSC experts comment:
<P>
"In our opinion, the financial markets are up strong since last November because they are correctly anticipating less government and lower taxes...If the markets were concerned, particularly the bond market, interest rates would have moved up long before now...Long term, the financial markets care much more about tax policy (by a wide margin) than any other single issue...Lower taxes means lower interest rates, stronger economic growth, and higher stock prices...Now, if Congress fails to pass a significant tax cut, then we would be worried."
<i>Mark J. Deschaine, Investment Counselors Incorporated, St. Louis, Missouri</i>
<BR><P>
"During meetings with clients in Boston last week, several portfolio managers, each investing literally billions of dollars of other people's money, all told me the same thing regarding the budget/tax debate in Washington.  They said they would be incredibly bearish if there is any hint of a "sellout" on real deficit reduction to get a deal and would be much more worried about the future of the markets, stocks and bonds, if that happens than if any so-called train wreck scenario unfolds on a short term basis."
<BR><i>James H. Slagter, The Research Network, Wayne, New Jersey</i>
<P>
"The world's financial markets have made clear their strong disapproval of congressional spending through a clear inverse correlation between Congressional spending (or proposing to spend) and the value of the dollar -- a proxy for the U.S. credit rating.  With each new spending bill, such as the crime bill or the failed Balanced Budget Amendment, the dollar tanks...If Congress truly wants to prevent a "train wreck" they had better pursue this balanced budget proposal -- full steam ahead."
<BR><I>James C. Kennedy, Kennedy Capital Management, Inc., St. Louis, Missouri</i>
<P>
"Worries over a significant backlash in financial markets due to a so-called budget 'train wreck' are grossly overblown.  If some kind of temporary default on federal government securities actually occurred -- though quite doubtful -- the impact on the bond market would likely be small and shortlived.  Indeed, a real threat to U.S. financial markets looms if capital gains tax reduction, including indexation for inflation, were to somehow fall by the wayside.  Since the Republican congressional victories in November 1994, equity markets have been robust, especially small-cap, high-tech stocks.  Markets have been counting on a significant capital gains tax cut; if this fails to materialize then we should be worried."

<b>For Immediate Release:  September 22, 1995<br>

Washington, D.C. </b>-- In a newly released booklet, the Small Business Survival (SBS) Foundation substantiates the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) crushing impact on entrepreneurship and economic growth, driving high-paying jobs and growth industries overseas.
                                     <P>
SBS Foundation -- a nonprofit, nonpartisan research and education organization examining issues crucial to the entrepreneurial sector of  the economy -- has published a booklet entitled FDA Hazards:  How FDA Red Tape Impacts Entrepreneurs and the U.S. Economy.
                                               <P>
SBS Foundation Chief Economist Raymond J. Keating, author of "FDA Hazards," offers numerous examples of where and how the FDA has gone awry.  From orange juice raids to export hurdles to shutting down the last smoked-herring company in the United States, the FDA has moved beyond a traditional role of reasonable safety regulation and education to a harsh, confrontational stance with U.S. entrepreneurs and businesses.
                                                            <P>
And while FDA enforcement tactics have become more aggressive and intrusive, its ability to meet deadlines in terms of medical device and drug approvals deteriorates.  Keating notes that the average FDA approval times in these critical areas fail to even come close to what is required.  As approval times become more lengthy and costly to U.S. firms, FDA's inflation-adjusted budget increased by almost 53 percent between 1989 and 1994, and the number of full-time FDA employees increased by more than 25 percent.
                                                                       <P>
"FDA Hazards" examines the record of the FDA in terms of its ability to move medical devices and drugs through its approval process in a timely manner;  its strategies and tactics when dealing with entrepreneurs and businesses;  its budget and number of employees;  the incentives under which FDA employees operate;  and more.
                                                                                <P>
Several market-based reforms are suggested in "FDA Hazards":
                                                                                         <ul>
<li>The FDA should be scrapped in favor of a smaller agency geared toward safety and education.  The private sector should be tapped for medical device and drug approvals.
                                                                                              <P>
<li>The government has a role in helping to secure consumers against substantial risks they could not know about -- i.e., safety -- as well as fraud.  Determining the efficacy of products, though, should be left to doctors, hospitals, experts, consumer groups, et al.
                                                                                    <P>
<li>The marketplace needs to rest upon sound legal and regulatory systems.  Unfortunately, both systems have gone awry, and some of our most dynamic industries -- medical devices and pharmaceuticals -- suffer accordingly.  Legal reform is needed.
                                                                          <P>
<li>The FDA ban against manufacturers distributing information regarding off-label uses of drugs such as independent journal articles and studies, should be lifted.
                                                                  <P>
<li>A federal agency's enforcement powers, as well as it processes and standards for determining what products fall under its jurisdiction, should be scrutinized and reviewed annually by Congress.
                                                       <P>
<li>The U.S. should negotiate and enter into agreements with other nations to recognize each other's drug and medical device approvals.
              </ul>   <p>
In addition to a total restructuring of the FDA, Keating also advocates the elimination of capital gains taxes, which will help attract capital to such high-risk industries as medical devices and pharmaceutical.
                                    <P>
Keating summarizes the FDA's woes as follows:  "A government agency that delays the approvals of beneficial drugs and medical devices to the degree that the FDA does, ensures that U.S.-based firms function at a severe disadvantage.  Of course, not only does this mean less investment, slower economic growth, and fewer jobs, but it also means that U.S. consumers often are denied access to life-saving devices and treatments."
                                                                                                                 <P>

<h2> DO MEGA CORPORATIONS LIKE WESTINGHOUSE AND DISNEY
                    NEED CORPORATE WELFARE?</h2>
</center>
<p>

<b>  WASHINGTON, DC --</b> Who is more in need of financial help -- the American taxpayer or Mickey Mouse?  The two high-profile buyouts of ABC and CBS this week paint a clear example of how ludicrous it is for Congress to be giving billion dollar handouts to the networks.
<p>
Karen Kerrigan, President of the Small Business Survival Committee last week announced that SBSC has created the Campaign for Broadcast Competition (CBC).  The Campaign opposes legislation now before the House which gives wealthy broadcasters - at no cost - public airwaves valued at $100 billion.
<p>
Kerrigan said, "Corporations like Disney and Westinghouse are paying top dollar for networks, while the networks are looking for a handout from Uncle Sam.  They plead that only government gifts will save them from technical advances.  But, the facts are clear."
<p>
"On August 1st, Westinghouse Electric Company agreed to buy CBS for $5.4 billion.  In 1994 alone, CBS's total revenue amounted to $3.7 billion, and their profit was $426 million. Westinghouse showed a revenue of $8.8 billion with a profit of $619 million."
<p>
"On July 31, 1995 Disney announced its intent to purchase CapCities/ABC for $19 billion.  CapCities reported a profit in 1994 of $638 million, while Disney reported a profit of $1.1 billion."
<p>
"With profits like these, why is Congress giving the networks six new digital channels? As the television industry consolidates, does it really make sense for the U.S. government to enrich these companies further?"
<p>
Kerrigan and the CBC advocate auctioning the air waves, as the FCC did recently for wireless communications.  "Auctioning off the airwaves would foster competition, generate billion in revenues to reduce the deficit, and end an insidious form of corporate welfare," continued Kerrigan.
<p>

<h3>LETTER TO THE COMMISSION</h3>
<blockquote>
<hr>

<B>FOREWORD</B>
<P>
<B>TO THE MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL COMMISSION ON ECONOMIC GROWTH
AND TAX REFORM</B></center>
<P>
<B>&quot;Taxation without representation is tyranny.&quot;</B>
 Those are the words that helped to ignite the American revolution
over two centuries ago.
<p>
As we approach the 21st century, the crescendo
for tax reform continues to build, year after year, election after
election.  Americans have looked at a tax system constantly increasing
in both rates and complexity, and concluded that taxation with
representation wasn't so good either.
<p>
The current tax system is indefensible.  It is overly complex, burdensome, and severely
limits economic opportunity for all Americans.
<p>
We made clear on the very first day of the 104th Congress that our top priority
would be to change the status quo and to bring fundamental change
to America.  And we agreed that there is no status quo that needs
more fundamental changing than our tax system.
<p>
We envision:
<ul><P>
<li> A tax system that is fairer, flatter, and simpler.
<P>
<li> A tax system that promotes, rather than punishes, job creation.
<P>
<li> A tax system that eliminates unnecessary paperwork burdens on
America's businesses.
<P>
<li> A tax system that recognizes the fact that our families are
performing the most important work of our society.
<P>
<li> A tax system that provides incentives for Americans who save
for the future in order to build a better life for themselves
and their families.
<P>
<li> A tax system that allows Americans, especially the middle-class,
to keep more of what they earn, but that raises enough money to
fund a leaner, more efficient federal government.
<P>
<li> A tax system that allows Americans to compute their taxes easily,
without the need for a lawyer, an accountant - or both.
</ul><p>
To help make this vision a reality, we named Jack Kemp, one of America's
most innovative thinkers on economic policy, to head the National
Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform --  a commission that
included thirteen more outstanding Americans.
<p>
The entire commission worked diligently for the past several months, holding public
hearings in eight cities, while constantly thinking about how
to create a better tax system. Their final report is guaranteed
to stimulate this important national dialogue.  It will surely
serve as a catalyst for congressional hearings and debate.  We
hope that it will also trigger conversations around kitchen tables,
water coolers, and in town hall meetings across the country.
<P>
We invite all those who read this report to write us with your thoughts
on its recommendations and conclusions, and to share with us other
suggestions on how we can create a tax system that promotes economic
growth and opportunity for all Americans.

<title>Unleashing America's Potential -- Preface -- TRC</title>

<h3>A NEW LEVEL OF THINKING</h3>
<blockquote><hr>
<P>
<B>PREFACE</B></center>
&quot;They act like all that money is born in Washington, D.C.&quot;  Perhaps no comment has better 
summarized the problem
with our nation's capital than this observation by Ed Zorinsky,
the late Democratic Senator from Nebraska.  And nowhere is this
governmental conceit expressed more destructively than in the
workings and effects of our Internal Revenue Code.
<p>
Many previous attempts at tax reform have been marred by the inside-the-beltway
assumption that the wealth of the nation belongs to its government.
 This position has perpetuated what could be called the &quot;tin-cup
syndrome&quot; - an environment in which the political competition
over scarce resources replaces the economic competition that produces
growth, creates jobs, spurs innovation and productivity.  As a
consequence, the tax code has over the years become increasingly
politicized, and is seen less as a simple tool for raising revenue
than as an instrument for social and economic engineering. In
turn, this has spawned a virtual industry of tax specialists and
special interest lobbyists, while exponentially increasing the
complexity of the code.
<p>
The National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform set out with a different set of 
assumptions, beginning with the belief that the purpose of the tax code is to raise money
while leaving citizens as free as possible to pursue the American
dream. Our charge from Senate Leader Dole and Speaker Gingrich
was clear:  Listen first and learn from the American people. 
We listened to ordinary taxpayers in hearings around the country.
 What we heard was a great deal of frustration, concern, and,
yes, anger with the current system.  Our hope has been to channel
those frustrations into a set of concrete principles and recommendations
that any new tax reform legislation must follow if it is to meet
the needs and expectations of the American people.
<p>
From June until September 1995, we heard from a cross-section of American taxpayers
in Boston, Omaha, Charlotte, Palo Alto, south-central Los Angeles,
Harlem, Cleveland, and Washington, D.C.  We listened to and learned
from family farmers and high-tech entrepreneurs, small businessmen
and women, medium-sized and large manufacturers, governors and
mayors, congressmen and senators, leading economists and local
activists.
<p>
Unlike previous &quot;reform&quot; commissions, our
activities were financed without a dime from the American taxpayer.
 Expenses were met through private contributions from more than
1,500 donors.  The fourteen commissioners received no compensation
for the long hours and hard work, save the tremendous reward of
knowing their sacrifices would help shape American history.  This
is an extraordinary group of American citizens who have demonstrated
through untold hours of hearings, deliberations, and study their
dedication to chart a course that will lead to a better America
for their children and grandchildren.  We believe we have set
that course.
<p>
In 1941, in a famous essay for Life magazine, Henry
Luce anticipated that the 20th century would be remembered as
the American Century.  The decades and events that followed -
the defeat of Nazi Germany, the collapse of Communism, the expansion
of American influence abroad - bore this prediction out.  Today,
many Americans fear they see that era of American preeminence
slipping away.  The optimism and boundlessness that have always
defined America are seen by some as fond but faded relics to be
quietly folded away.
<p>
This report reflects the firm conviction that America can do better.  None of the members of this commission
would have accepted this challenge if we did not believe in the
possibility of real progress and real reform. 
<p>
Albert Einstein observed that &quot;the problems of today cannot be solved at
the same level of thinking on which they were created.&quot; 
We have concluded that the complex tax code of the 20th century
is poorly suited for dealing with the complex world of the 21st.
 The vision outlined in the following pages cannot be realized
by simply rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic we call our
current tax code. A brand new tax code, modeled on the principles
and recommendations proposed in this report, can chart the economic
waters ahead and launch our country on its voyage toward the next
American century.

<title>Unleashing America's Potential -- Introduction -- TRC</title>

<h3>SETTING THE EAGLE FREE</h3><br>
<HR>

<P>
<B>INTRODUCTION</B>
</center><p><blockquote><blockquote>
<I>&quot;In short, it is a paradoxical truth
that tax rates are too high today and tax revenues are too low,
and the soundest way to raise the revenues in the long run is
to cut the rates now...The purpose of cutting taxes now is not
to incur a budget deficit, but to achieve the more prosperous,
expanding economy which can bring a budget surplus.&quot;</I>
<P>
John F. Kennedy<BR>
Economic Club of New York<BR>
December 14, 1962</blockquote>
<P>
These words of President Kennedy were a great inspiration to me as the tax reform movement was 
launched in the early 1980s with the Kemp/Roth tax cut.  Kennedy's vision and
courage can serve as examples for all Americans as we struggle
to make this nation better for our children and grandchildren.
 His remarks from the Economic Club of New York ring as true today
as they did in 1962. 
<p>
 At the first meeting of our commission back in June, I held up a blank sheet of paper and said, &quot;This
is what we start with.&quot;  That was our charge: Senate Majority
Leader Bob Dole and House Speaker Newt Gingrich appointed the
National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform to study
the current tax code, listen to the suggestions and ideas of people
from around the country, and submit to Congress our recommendations
for comprehensive reform.  
<P>
A very diverse and dedicated group of 14 people, with the help of an invaluable, overworked, and
underpaid staff, set out to design an entirely new tax system
for America's 21st century; one which would promise a booming
economy, promote job creation, and ensure the greatest possible
opportunity for all Americans to work, save, invest, and reach
their potential.  We operated under the premise that an economic
growth rate of 2.5% is unacceptable to the American people.
<p>
This commission was empowered not merely to offer superficial reforms,
to trim a rate here and close a loophole there, but to begin with
a <I>tabula rasa</I> and map out a totally new tax structure for
America's next century.  We also wanted to help inform the whole
world, particularly the emerging democracies, that the goal of
tax policy is raising revenue, not redistribution of wealth. 
<p>
Our nation has arrived at a unique moment in history.  With the
passing of the Cold War, we are standing at the edge of a new
millennium with extraordinary possibilities.  Our country is poised
to help lead the world into a new era of economic growth fueled
by an information-age technological revolution that can yield
unparalleled expansion in jobs, productivity, innovation, and
prosperity.  We must embrace this opportunity and challenge. 
However, such an embrace will prove difficult, perhaps impossible,
if we remain saddled with our current tax code.  The current system
is indefensible: it is riddled with special interest tax breaks,
and it overtaxes both labor and capital.  We must construct a
tax system that reflects our highest values and unleashes our
greatest potential.
<p>
  The comments and concerns we heard from the
American people over the last several months, coupled with a systematic
review of the current tax code, helped us establish certain principles
to guide us to our conclusions.  Surely, a tax code which is simple
and fair must generate sufficient revenue so that the federal
government may carry out its legitimate tasks.  Second, it must
not place a tax burden on those members of society least able
to bear one.  And, perhaps most important of all, it must not
restrict the innovative and entrepreneurial capacities of Americans
upon which rising living standards and our general prosperity
so greatly depend.  Our proposals are in keeping with these principles.
<p>
Wildly excessive and unjust taxes have locked away access to capital
and credit necessary for lower-income Americans to launch the
next generation of entrepreneurship.  Today, sadly, we see the
American people's sense of dynamism and hope, their ability to
strive and compete diminished by a tax code which penalizes success,
retards investment, and sends capital fleeing overseas.  The commission
is united in the belief that only a pro-growth tax code can restore
America's confidence at home and her greatness abroad.  We want
a tax code and an overall economy that will liberate the American
dream and remove the barriers to upward social and economic mobility.
 The American ethos of entrepreneurship and optimism made America
great once before.  We believe these proposals will bolster that
ethos again and help restore integrity and honesty to our system.
<p>
The author John Gardner has observed that there are many contributing
factors to the rise of civilization - accidents of resources,
geography, and military power.  But whatever other ingredients
comprise the greatness of nations, he writes, &quot;There occurs
at breathtaking moments in history an exhilarating burst of energy
and motivation, of hope and zest and imagination, and a severing
of the bonds that normally hold in check the full release of human
possibilities.  A door is opened, and the caged eagle soars.&quot;
 That eagle, the symbol of our nation, represents the creative
spirit, talents, and aspirations of the American people.  The
charge of this commission and the intent of our recommendations
is to open the door and help set that eagle in all of us free.

<title>Unleashing America's Potential -- Imagine An America -- TRC</title>
<body><center><img src="/taxcom/fr-head.gif" alt="TRC:  Unleashing America's Potential"><br><font size="-1"><a href="/taxcom/reptoc.html">Table of Contents</a> | <a href="/taxcom/">TRC Home</a> | <a href="mailto:arnettgm@heritage.org">Feedback</a></font><P></center><center> 
<h3>IMAGINE AN AMERICA WITH A PRO-GROWTH, PRO-FAMILY TAX CODE</h3><br>
<blockquote><HR>
</center>
<P>
<I><B>The National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform
recommends to the Congress and to the President of the United
States that the current Internal Revenue Code be repealed in its
entirety.
<p>
The present system is beyond repair --  it is impossibly
complex,  outrageously expensive, overly intrusive, economically
destructive, and manifestly unfair. 
<p>
It is time to replace this failed system with a new simplified tax system for the 21st century:
a single low rate, taxing income only once with a generous personal
exemption and full deductibility of the payroll tax for America's
working men and women. 
<p>
This system will reduce the tax burden on middle-income people and will help remove the barriers that 
keep low-income Americans from reaching their fullest potential.
<p>
These changes, once in place, should be sealed with a guarantee of long-term
stability, requiring a two-thirds vote of the U.S. Congress to
raise the rate.
<p>
This new system is predicated on a commitment to expanding growth and opportunity. We believe the 
changes we
propose will help double the rate of economic growth. 
<p>
A  stronger economy will  create more jobs, raise family incomes, expand ownership
and entrepreneurship, and ensure greater opportunity for our children
and grandchildren.   It will also produce additional revenues
for balancing the budget and reducing the burden of national debt.</B></I>
<P>
The principles and recommendations contained in this report comprise
the &quot;Tax Test&quot; - the standard to which any new tax system
must be held.  We ask that Congress not pass nor the President
sign any tax legislation that fails to pass this test.  And we
encourage the public to use the goals and guidelines we offer
as a road map through the coming national debate on tax reform.
<p>
Our aim: to introduce a new system of taxation that brings out
the best in the American character, that plays to our strengths
and not our weaknesses, that speaks to our hopes and not our fears.
 <B>Our recommendations are based on a vision of America that
places the individual -- not the government -- at the center of
society: </B> 
<P><ul>
<li> We believe that government does not create opportunity; citizens
do, if government will get out of their way.  
<P>
<li> We believe that government is not the engine of economic growth;
it is, more frequently, the monkey wrench in the machine. 
<P>
<li> We believe that taxpayers' earnings and savings -- their property 
-- are not assets on loan from the government.  The government
is power on loan from the people.
</ul><p>
One of the most serious shortcomings of previous attempts at tax reform has been the inability of average
Americans to make their voices heard above the chorus of special
interests. We have tried a radically different approach:  Listening
to the people first.
<p>
In his first debate with Stephen Douglas, Abraham Lincoln remarked that &quot;with public sentiment, 
nothing can fail; without it nothing can succeed.&quot;  We believe that
any major legislative attempt to replace the current tax code
will falter unless it is first preceded by a national debate on
what the new system should look like. 
<p>
Many previous attempts to reform public policy have failed to achieve their aims  because
they substituted closed meetings for democratic dialogue, focusing
too much on expert analysis and too little on citizens' concerns.
By including the public in the deliberations over tax reform,
this commission seeks to build broad-based consensus behind a
new tax system for America's next millennium.
<p>
It was with this spirit that the commission held cross-country public hearings
-- from the historic home of the Boston tea-party to the heart
of south-central L.A.  At every hearing in every city, we asked
people to tell us what they saw as the problems with the current
system and the goals any reform plan should achieve.  
<P><ul>
<li> In Omaha, farmers pleaded for simpler filing and the freedom
to pass family farms on to their children without fear of federal
confiscation. 
<P>
<li> In the Silicon Valley, high-tech entrepreneurs told of the countless
ideas conceived but never born because of a scarcity of investment
capital. 
<P>
<li> In south-central Los Angeles, small business-owners voiced frustrations
at not being able to expand or hire new workers because of a tax
bite that eats away their profits. 
<P>
<li> And in Harlem, inner-city entrepreneurs expressed both bitterness
and bewilderment at a tax code which sucked revenues out of their
neighborhoods while preventing investment from flowing in.
</ul><p>
In our nation's capital, we heard from elected officials in both the
House and the Senate who have for many years been leaders in tax
reform.  Because of their tireless public service, tax reform
is a priority issue on the nation's agenda.
<p>
We also heard from many of the finest economists in the
country who shared their knowledge and research with us at every
hearing.
<p>
After our hearings, we held a series of working sessions
to analyze what we had heard and to begin discussing our recommendations
for change. During one of our working sessions, the commissioners
put aside the charts and graphs for a moment, stepped back, and
tried to imagine what kind of world they would like America's
next generation to grow up in.  We were asked to think about how
replacing the tax code might help bring that world about:
<P><ul>
<li> Imagine an America enjoying a decade of economic growth at nearly
twice the present rate -- creating jobs, expanding opportunities,
and lifting living standards for all. 
<P>
<li> Imagine an America in which more dreams born in basements and
garages grow into multi-million dollar businesses because abundant
capital seeks out good ideas, and entrepreneurs and investors
are confident that their risk-taking will be rewarded, not punished.
 
<P>
<li> Imagine an America where it is easier to get a job than to get
on welfare, and where our inner cities share in America's growth
and prosperity.  Imagine these neighborhoods ringing out, not
with sirens in the night, but with the sounds of new storefronts
being opened and new businesses being built.
<P>
<li> Imagine an America where home ownership and higher education
are within the reach of every American so that each citizen owns
a stake in the system and shares a common interest and responsibility
for its future. 
<P>
<li> Imagine an America where young couples aren't asked to take
a tax hit in order to exchange their marriage vows, and where
young families can save for their future without being punished
for their thrift.
<P>
<li> Imagine an America where Americans have enough to give, not
just to and through their government, but to their churches, synagogues,
mosques, their charities, and neighbors in need.
<P>
<li> Imagine an America where the I.R.S. becomes the &quot;TPA&quot;
-- a Taxpayer Protection Agency -- to ensure that no one pays more
than is owed.  Imagine a customer-friendly approach to raising
revenue, based on a belief in the basic honesty of the American
people, that treats them with dignity and respect.
</ul><p>
<I><B>We believe that replacing our tax system with one that is simpler and fairer
can help to make these American dreams come true.</B></I> 
<p>
America was not founded on envy or resentment. The American idea was never
to keep everyone at the same mean level, but to give everyone
the chance to rise as high as his or her effort, initiative and
God-given talent would allow.  It was a promise of equal opportunity,
not of end results: the confidence that whatever you aspired to
become -- be it artist, inventor, or entrepreneur -- you could make
it happen here. 
<p>
As the country pursues this change, how we transition
from the existing bankrupt system to the new system will be important.
 Complicated issues will arise.  Nonetheless, we are confident
that the Congress and the President will solve these transitions
in order to bring about this new tax system.  Dramatic change
never is easy, and complicated issues will arise in the transition.
 But change we must, confident that, with the leadership of the
Congress and the president, the American can-do spirit will prevail.
<p>
A new tax system, as envisioned in the following pages of this
report, can take a first step toward renewing that sense of hope
and possibility by unleashing a cascade of benefits, beginning
with greater economic growth, lower interest rates, and expanded
job opportunities for working Americans.
<p>
In this spirit, we invite the American people and their elected leaders from both political
parties to use the Tax Test as a checklist as they move forward
in replacing the current tax code.  We urge the Congress and the
President to base any new legislation on the principles and recommendations
submitted in this report.  Furthermore, we urge President Clinton
to appoint a presidential task force or commission to bring the
recommendations offered by this congressionally appointed commission
to the next level of public debate.

<title>Unleashing America's Potential -- Boiling Point --TRC</title>
<body><center><img src="/taxcom/fr-head.gif" alt="TRC:  Unleashing America's Potential"><br><font size="-1"><a href="/taxcom/reptoc.html">Table of Contents</a> | <a href="/taxcom/">TRC Home</a> | <a href="mailto:arnettgm@heritage.org">Feedback</a></font><P></center>
<center>

<h3>AT THE BOILING POINT</h3>
<blockquote>
<HR></center>
<p>
&quot;My grandmother used to tell me the folk tale of the frog,&quot;
recounted Commissioner Herman Cain of his childhood in Atlanta,
Georgia.  &quot;If you put a frog in a pot of hot water, he would
jump right out.  But if you put him in a pot of cool water and
gradually turned up the heat, he wouldn't notice the rising temperature
and would eventually boil to death.&quot;
<p>
The American taxpayer is in hot water. Escalating marginal tax rates, increasing complexity,
and advancing intrusiveness have created a system that has reached
the boiling point. Over the years, Americans have surrendered
more and more of their freedom to higher taxes.  The result has
not been to enhance economic security or to close the gulf between
rich and poor.  Instead, it has led to fewer jobs, slow economic
growth, diminished hope and opportunity, an erosion of trust and
confidence in government, and an ebbing of the American spirit
of enterprise. It is a history that echoes James Madison's warning
that &quot;there are more instances of the abridgment of the freedom
of the people by gradual and silent encroachments...than by violent
and sudden usurpation.&quot; 
<p>
The time has passed for incremental reform.  The problems with the current system have grown too deeply
entrenched to be solved with quick fixes and cosmetic repairs.
<p>
<b>We believe the current tax code cannot be revised, should not
be reinvented, and must not be retained.  Therefore, the commission
is unanimous: It is time to throw out the seven-million-word mess
of tax laws and regulations and begin anew.</b>
<p>
Marc Negri of Santa Rosa, California, wrote to tell us that, &quot;The current system
is so wrong and such a disincentive to the everyday worker that
it cannot be saved.&quot;  Lawrence Madsen of Mills, Wyoming,
prepares peoples' taxes for a living, and yet wrote: &quot;I am
so disgusted with the [system] that I must urge you to completely
abolish the Internal Revenue Code and start over.&quot;  A couple
from Astor, Florida, was even more blunt: &quot;The current tax
structure is way out of date with the real world, too complicated
with too many loopholes.  We say dump it!&quot;
<p>
Americans' eagerness for real change reflects in part their frustration with a system
that in the past forty years has seen 31 &quot;significant&quot;
reforms and an astounding 400 additional &quot;revisions&quot;
through public laws .   And yet the tax code is more complex,
more costly, and more economically destructive than ever. This
is the story of how we got here.
<P>
<B>THE ROAD TO TAX OPPRESSION</B><br>
<p>
The <I>New York Times</I>, in a 1909 editorial opposing the very first income tax, predicted:
&quot;When men get in the habit of helping themselves to the property
of others, they cannot easily be cured of it.&quot;  The history
of our tax code, in economic terms, mirrors the course of most
addictions: advancing dependence, diminished returns, and deteriorating
health of the afflicted.
<p>
Supporters of the Sixteenth Amendment
touted the income tax as the rich man's burden - forcing &quot;the
Carnegies, the Vanderbilts, the Morgans, and the Rockefellers&quot;
to pay while sparing the middle class from pain.  Indeed, after
the income tax was enacted in 1913, fewer than two percent of
American families were required to file a tax return.  Rates ranged
from 1 to 7 percent - with the highest rate applying only to Americans
who had the equivalent of $7.7 million in income in today's terms.
<p>
The rates did not stay that low for long. In 1916 the top rate
doubled.  A year later, on the eve of America's entry into World
War I, it soared to 67 percent.  With the Second World War, the
rate was raised to 94 percent. In the 1950s the top rate remained
at the sky high level of more than 90 percent.  President Kennedy
initiated legislation that cut the top rate to 70 percent, but
it was not until the Reagan growth years that the top rate was
lowered dramatically to 28 percent.  Under the current administration,
the rate has resumed its ascent, with combined federal taxes pushing
the top rate above 40 percent, including Medicare taxes and phase-outs.
<p>
With every attempt by politicians to &quot;soak the rich,&quot; the
water mark has risen on the middle class.  Author Frank Chodorov
has summed up the incremental march of encroaching taxation: &quot;At
first it was the incomes of corporations, then of rich citizens,
then of well-provided widows and opulent workers, and finally
the wealth of housemaids and the tips of waitresses.&quot;  Congress
expanded the income tax into the ranks of the middle class for
the same reason Willie Sutton robbed banks: that's where the money
is.  
<p>
This shift was mainly achieved by gradually multiplying the
number of taxpayers required to file income tax returns and by
raising average tax rates on ordinary citizens.  Until World War
II, the average tax rate (that is, the total tax paid divided
by income) on a family with a 1991 income of $50,000 never rose
above 4 percent.  Since World War II, it has never fallen below
14 percent.  
<p>
Marginal rates on the middle class have risen even
more dramatically. Marginal rates are the &quot;tax bracket&quot;
rates that apply to any extra dollar of income -- such as raises,
overtime,  bonuses, or a second family income.  The marginal middle
class tax rate never rose above 8 percent prior to World War II.
 Since then, it has never fallen below 22 percent, rising as high
as 33 percent during the high-inflation, bracket creep years of
the 1970s.
<p>
Today, there are three principal defects of our income
tax system that must be fixed immediately.
<P><ul>
<li> <B>Economically Destructive:</B>  Steeply graduated tax rates
on both labor and capital destroy jobs, penalize saving and investment,
and punish personal efforts to get ahead through hard work.
<P>
<li> <B>Impossibly Complex:</B>  The mind-boggling complexity of
the current tax code imposes an unacceptable burden on taxpayers
and a huge cost on the economy. 
<P>
<li> <B>Overly Intrusive:</B>  The vast enforcement powers conferred
on the I.R.S. are increasingly seen as infringements of privacy
and personal freedom. 
</ul><P>
<B>ECONOMICALLY DESTRUCTIVE</B>
<p>
In the famous Supreme Court case, <I>McCulloch v. Maryland</I>, Chief Justice Marshall wrote: 
&quot;The power to tax involves the power to destroy.&quot;  Some of the
ways in which the current tax code destroys our economic vitality
include:
<P><ul>
<li> High marginal tax rates that weaken the link between effort
and reward, depress productivity, and kill jobs.
<P>
<li> Multiple layers of taxation on work, saving, and investment
that dry up new capital for investment.
<P>
<li> Capital gains taxes that act as a barrier to capital formation
- preventing the flow of  investment to new enterprises and would-be
entrepreneurs.
<P>
<li> An &quot;alternative minimum tax&quot; that imposes immense
compliance costs on businesses, sapping resources that could otherwise
be put to constructive use.
<P>
<li> Double-taxation of corporate income which shrinks business investment
and encourages companies to take on extra debt.
<P>
<li> Estate and gift taxes that force families to sell their businesses
or family farms. 
</ul><p>
A fundamental principle of economics is that
the more you tax something, the less you get of it.  And if you
tax success, you get less success. The current confiscatory system
begs the questions: Why work harder if each extra dollar earns
you less?  Why save for tomorrow when spending today is cheaper?
 Why dream bigger, when little dreams are less expensive?  The
disillusioned answer of many Americans is simply: Why bother?
<p>
 But the current system does not simply sap the initiative and
aspirations of <I>individual</I> taxpayers, it undermines the
economic strength of our nation as a whole. As President Kennedy
once observed:  &quot;An economy hampered with high tax rates
will never produce enough revenue to balance the budget, just
as it will never produce enough output and enough jobs.&quot;
<p>
High marginal tax rates combined with multiple taxation of work, saving,
and investment act as a &quot;double-barreled shotgun aimed at
the American economy,&quot; accountant Ted Krauss told the commission
during a hearing in Washington.  The price tag was estimated by
Professor Dale Jorgenson of Harvard University who told the commission
that the income level in the United States could be 15 percent
to 20 percent higher than today if these biases did not exist.
<p>
This translates to losses of as much as $4,000 to $6,000 per year
for typical middle-income families.  The tremendous economic drain
caused by an anti-work, anti-saving, and anti-growth tax system
does not even take into account the enormous waste of resources
-- the time, money, and brainpower -- lost in trying to comply with
the current code.
<P>
<B>IMPOSSIBLY COMPLEX</B>
<p>
Today's tax code is so complex that many
Americans despair that only someone with an advanced degree in
rocket science could figure it out.  They are wrong. Even a certified
genius such as Albert Einstein needed help in figuring out his
Form 1040. Consider this example from the Internal Revenue Code's
rules on the Earned Income Tax Credit.  Here's how they describe
the little human creature we call a child:
<P>
(A) IN GENERAL.-The term &quot;qualifying child&quot; means, 
with respect to any taxpayer for any taxable year, 
an individual-
<P>
(i)  who bears a relationship to the taxpayer described in subparagraph
(B),
<P>
(ii)  except as provided in subparagraph (B)(iii), who has the
same principal place of abode as the taxpayer for more than one-half
of such taxable year,
<P>
(iii)  who meets the age requirements of subparagraph (C), and
<P>
(iv)  with respect to whom the taxpayer meets the identification
requirements of subparagraph (D).
<p>
This may look like English to
the experts, but it is total gibberish to most other Americans.
 If nothing is done to simplify the impossible language of the
current tax code, every American <I>will</I> need a laptop just
to figure it out.Professor James Eustice of NYU Law School once
defined an &quot;expert&quot; as &quot;a person who avoids small
errors as he sweeps on to the grand fallacy.&quot;   The problem
with the tax code, he says, &quot;is that it has been written
and interpreted by so many 'experts' that it has lost sight of
the fact that [real people] have to function under this system.&quot;
 The result is a tax code so complex that even the 'experts' themselves
can't figure it out.  This was illustrated by an annual survey
of tax experts conducted by <I>Money Magazine</I>. Each year,
the magazine would send a hypothetical tax return to 50 professional
tax preparers, and every year it got back a startling range of
responses, often encompassing 50 different answers.  Needless
to say, if the &quot;experts&quot; have trouble understanding
the tax system, the odds are stacked against the rest of us.
<p>
Convoluted rules and regulations force small businesses to hire expensive
accountants, forgo expansion or new opportunities, or in some
cases avoid the entire mess by going underground.  Tim Sabus of
Denver, Colorado, wrote to the commission: &quot;As an entrepreneur,
I experience first hand the horrors of our tax system.  It has
grown into a monstrous predator that kills incentives, swallows
time, and chokes the hopes and dreams of many.  We have abandoned
several job-creating business concepts due to the tax complexities
that would arise.&quot;  
<p>
Another exasperated business owner, Frank
Goodnight, told the commission at our Charlotte hearing that &quot;during
the recession of 1992, our company paid our accounting firm more
money than we paid in taxes.&quot;  He is not alone: in 1991,
the Tax Foundation reported that small corporations spent a <I>minimum</I>
of $382 in compliance costs for every $100 they paid in income
taxes.
<p>
According to 1995 I.R.S. estimates, businesses will spend
about 3.4 billion hours and individuals will spend about 1.7 billion
hours embroiled in tax-related paperwork. That means nearly three
million people -- more people than serve in the U.S. armed forces
-- work full time all year just to comply with tax laws, at a cost
of about $200 billion a year, according to the Tax Foundation.
In economic costs, this is like taking every new car, van, and
truck that General Motors builds in a year and driving them off
of a cliff. 
<P>
In a recent hearing before the House Ways and Means Committee,
William Dakin, senior tax counsel of Mobil, brought with him a
six foot high stack of bound papers, weighing 150 pounds.  These
were Mobil's corporate tax forms for 1993.  It cost Mobil an estimated
$10 million, and the equivalent of 57 people working full time
for a year, just to figure how much tax the company owed.  This
is the essence of a brutally complicated tax system.
<p>
Jeff Renner, a real-estate developer from Bellevue, Nebraska, voiced the concern
of many witnesses about the costly burden of compliance: &quot;That
time and effort and money did not educate a single child, it didn't
feed a single family, and it didn't produce a single tangible
object to improve the life of anyone.&quot; And Roger McCarthy
who runs an engineering firm in Menlo Park, California, complained
of how the tax industry absorbs the high-tech talent that could
be working in productive fields: &quot;It is disturbing that we
are not competing with companies like Intel and Hewlett-Packard
for these top stars, but rather with Big Six accounting firms.&quot;

<P>
<B>OVERLY INTRUSIVE </B>
<p>
There is no simple way of administering
a monstrously complex tax code, just as there is no fair way of
enforcing an unfair system.  Former Treasury official Ernest S.
Christian told the commission:  &quot;The present federal income
tax code is a national disgrace that...has characteristics that
would be condemned in any human personality.  It is inexcusably
class conscious, it is hypocritical, it is meddlesome, it is overbearing,
it is mean and hurtful, it is covetous, and above all, it is downright
foolish.&quot;  It is no wonder that the agency charged with enforcing
such a system has become the object of increasing public ire.
<p>
Perhaps the most troublesome consequence of our modern-day income tax
system is the enormous power that Congress has conferred on the
Internal Revenue Service to force taxpayers to comply with the
tax code. Twice as big as the C.I.A. and five times the size of
the F.B.I., the I.R.S. controls more information about individual
Americans than any other agency. Without a search warrant, the
I.R.S. has the right to search the property and financial documents
of American citizens.  Without a trial, the I.R.S. has the right
to seize property from Americans.  What the I.R.S. calls its own
&quot;presumption of correctness&quot; leaves many taxpayers feeling
that they are &quot;guilty until proven innocent&quot; - a standard
which turns norms of justice upside down.
<p>
Even those within the I.R.S. hierarchy concede the inquisitorial nature of the powers
granted the agency.  Fred Goldberg, former Commissioner of Internal
Revenue, laments that &quot;while it is unfair to the many fine
people who work there, the I.R.S. has become a symbol of the most
intrusive, oppressive, and non-democratic institution in our democratic
society.&quot;
<p>
The code is so complicated that the I.R.S. itself has trouble understanding it.  &quot;As a retired revenue 
agent, I feel qualified to attest to the monstrosity that the Internal
Revenue Code has become,&quot; a citizen from Michigan wrote to
the commission.  &quot;When people who are employed to enforce
the tax laws have difficulty understanding its complicated and
sometimes incomprehensible provisions, it's time for a change.&quot;
 Of the liens the I.R.S. filed in 1990, a General Accounting Office
study found 16,000 errors.  The error rate for penalty notices
to employers on tax deposits has stood as high as 44 percent.
<p>
  Even when the I.R.S. is not in error, many of its practices
make little sense.  For example, tax documents are not treated
as &quot;timely filed&quot; if sent by Federal Express rather
than the U.S. Postal Service. The I.R.S. charges taxpayers interest
even when the taxpayer is due a refund.  In another example, one
particularly exasperated citizen wrote to the commission and enclosed
a notice just received from the I.R.S. assessing a penalty against
his company.  For an underpayment of one cent on his tax returns,
the company received a letter from the I.R.S. imposing a penalty
of more than $150. Others should be so lucky.  Many who testified
before the commission told tales not just of tax penalties, but
of thousands of dollars in legal fees and countless hours with
lawyers in efforts to rectify minor and unwitting infractions,
or clear their records of unjust charges.
<p>
In Charlotte, businessowner Jean Hodges recounted a tale of horror in which she was forced
to pay tens of thousands of dollars and spend untold hours trying
to correct an error made by her company's bookkeeper.  &quot;I
would like to see Congress pass legislation affording small businesses
relief from onerous and intimidating I.R.S. regulations,&quot;
she said.

The preceding pages illustrate what
is wrong with the current tax system.  But the case for a 21st
century tax system must be made by more than a mere indictment
of the status quo.  To paraphrase Peter Drucker: You have to decide
what's right before you decide what's possible.  The following
chapter outlines principles upon which a better future can be
built.

<h3>WORKING PRINCIPLES</h3>
<blockquote>
<HR>

<P>

<B>...FOR THE WAY AMERICA WORKS</B></center>
<p>
When a group of architects its down to design a new building, they don't start by picking
out the draperies and choosing the color of the carpet.  They
begin by creating the basic outlines for the structure to come.
Similarly, the charge and purpose of this commission is not to
dictate the finishing touches of finalized legislation.  Instead,
it is to establish the foundation upon which a new system can
be raised.
<p>
The commission's six working principles for a 21st century
tax system are not isolated ideas, randomly grouped, but rather
principles that link together to form a sequence - a chain of
economic DNA - that can renew the health of our economy and release
the potential of the American people.
<p>
<B>ECONOMIC GROWTH</B>, the
engine of opportunity and prosperity, can only be unleashed by
a tax code that encourages initiative, hard work, and saving.
<p>
Such a system must be based on <B>FAIRNESS</B>, treating all citizens
equally. 
<p>
The system should achieve <B>SIMPLICITY</B> so that anyone
can figure it out. 
<p>
A fair tax system also requires <B>NEUTRALITY</B>,
 because the tax code should not pick winners or losers, or tax
saving more heavily than consumption. 
<p>
The new tax system also needs <B>VISIBILITY</B> so that everyone gets an honest accounting
of government's cost.
<p>
A visible tax system will have <B>STABILITY</B> so that people can plan for their futures.
<P>

<B>ECONOMIC GROWTH<I><br>
...Because expanding opportunity, prosperity,
and social mobility form the foundation of a free and healthy
society.</I></B>
<p>
None of the myriad challenges confronting our
nation -- be they poverty, crime, racial tension, welfare dependence,
or the budget deficit - can be solved without strong economic
growth.  Therefore, any new tax system must be predicated, first
and foremost, on a commitment to revitalizing the American economy
and lifting barriers to opportunity.  
<p>
No nation has ever taxed
its way to prosperity. Indeed, one of the world's fastest growing
economies over the past 20 years, Hong Kong, has one of the lowest
marginal tax rate systems -- 15 percent or less -- on labor and
capital.  Throughout the ages, higher taxes have been inversely
related to higher productivity and higher growth. Our own history provides evidence of this axiom. 
<p><center>
<img src="rpt1.gif" alt="graph">
</center>
<I>There is an inverse relationship
between revenue collections from the wealthy and high marginal
tax rates.</I>
<p>
America has experienced  three periods of very strong
economic growth in this century:  the 1920s, the 1960s, and the
1980s.  Each of these growth spurts coincided with a period of
reductions in marginal tax rates.  In the eight years following
the Harding-Coolidge tax cuts, the American economy grew by more
than five percent per year.  Following the Kennedy tax cuts in
the early 1960s, the economy grew by nearly five percent per year
and real tax revenues rose by 29% from 1962 to 1968 (after having
remained flat for a decade).  In the seven years following the
1981 Reagan tax cuts, the economy grew by nearly four percent
per year while real federal revenues rose by 26 percent. 
<p>
Over the years, we have seen economic output rise as tax rates <I>fell</I>
(and fall as tax rates rose).  But federal revenue raised as a
percentage of national output has remained <I>flat</I>.  As the
accompanying chart indicates, the federal government historically
collects about 19 percent of gross domestic product  - regardless
of how high the tax rate has been pushed.
<p><center>
<img src="rpt2.gif" alt="graph">
</center>
<I>The top line represents
the top personal tax rates from 1952 to 1995.  The bottom line
shows revenue to the federal government expressed as a percentage
of total economic output. </I>
<p>
High rates simply mean a smaller economy - and less income to tax.  Clearly, 19 percent of a small
economy brings in less revenue than 19 percent of a big economy.
 One more reason why economic growth should be the goal of any
new tax system.
<P>
<B>FAIRNESS <I>...Because democracy is based on the principle
of equality before the law.</I></B>  
<p>
 One of the main themes the commission heard in hearings around the country is that taxpayers
are willing to shoulder their share of the burden, as long as
others pull their own weight as well. The current tax code - with
its confusion of proliferating rates, deductions, exemptions,
and transfers of wealth from one constituency to another - contributes
to the overwhelming conviction of many Americans that the present
system is unfair. 
<p>
The definition of fairness that emerged from
hours of testimony before the commission was clear and unambiguous:
Any new system must satisfy three simple goals:   
<p>
<B>Tax equally: Does it treat taxpayers equally?
<P>
 True progressivity: Is it compassionate to those least able to pay? 
<p>
 Lower tax rates: Does it keep the tax rate low?</B>
<P>
<B>TAX EQUALLY</B>
<p>
To most Americans, fairness means that the rules
apply to everybody and everybody plays by the rules.  Christine
Perkowski of Richboro, Pennsylvania, wrote to the commission:
&quot;I do not mind paying my fair share as long as everyone else
does, but I feel that many, many people and companies are not
paying their fair share because they have the money to hire smart
accountants and lawyers.&quot;  
<p>
Under a simpler, fairer system,
no one will get out of paying their share - no matter how many
&quot;smart accountants and lawyers&quot; they can afford to hire.
 By streamlining the current Rube Goldberg contraption of multiple
rates and rules, we can reduce the number of moveable parts that
are manipulated by those who seek to take advantage of the system.
Clearly, under the current multiple-rate system, any tax &quot;loopholes&quot;
- deductions, exemptions, and credits - are more valuable to the
wealthy than to those in lower brackets, reinforcing the perception
that the rich do not pay their fair share.  A single-rate system
would level the playing field by eliminating the current distortion
in which tax breaks are worth more when a person's income is higher.
<p>
Melvin Barlow of Las Cruces, New Mexico, argued this definition of fairness
in a letter to the commission:  &quot;It is not right that the
harder a man works, the more he is taxed&quot; because the government
imposes a higher rate on each additional dollar he earns.  A single-rate
system keeps pace with the taxpayer as he climbs the hill of economic
opportunity and does not weigh him down more heavily with higher
rates at every step he tries to take. 
<P>
For taxable income above
the personal exemption, if one taxpayer earns ten times as much
as his neighbor, he should pay ten times as much in taxes.  Not
twenty times as much -- as he would with multiple and confiscatory
tax rates.  Not five times as much -- as he might with special
loopholes.  Ten times as much income, ten times as much taxes.
 That's the deal.   
<P>
<B>TRUE TAX PROGRESSIVITY </B>
<p>
Americans must first be able to
feed, clothe, and house their families before they are asked to
feed the federal spending machine.  A generous personal exemption
will allow those citizens at the bottom of the economic ladder
to gain a foothold and begin their climb before taxes take effect.
<p>
Today, those who try to move from welfare to work face the highest
marginal tax rates in America when lost benefits are included
--  facing effective tax rates that can actually exceed 100 percent.
 For example, if a single mother on welfare takes a job, she stands
to lose more than a dollar for every dollar she earns. Her first
paycheck may be more than canceled-out by the economic hits she
takes when she loses Aid to Families with Dependent Children,
Medicaid, Food Stamps, and public housing allowances.  In addition
to losing benefits, she now <I>also</I> must pay Social Security
and Medicare taxes, federal and probably state income tax, while
facing a host of work related costs, including transportation
and child care. 
<p>
We need a tax system that expands opportunity
and furthers economic independence by strengthening the link between
effort and reward, not by slapping poverty-inducing tax rates
on people as soon as they get their heads above water.  True progressivity
can be achieved by a single tax rate with a generous personal
exemption.  With an exemption, a &quot;single rate&quot; does
not mean that everyone pays the same percentage of income in taxes.
A generous personal exemption would remove the burden on those
least able to pay; as incomes rise, the average tax rate would
gradually rise up to the single rate.
<P>
<B>LOWER TAX RATES </B>
<p>
The consensus of the majority of witnesses
who wrote to the commission can be summed up in two words: lower
taxes.  
<p>
 Historians may point to America's beginnings and a revolution
deeply rooted in reaction to taxation of the original thirteen
British colonies.  Others reference religious traditions, including
Moses' warning to Pharaoh that he may tax up to one fifth and
no more -- before demanding that he &quot;let my people go.&quot;
 Indeed, Commissioner Dean Kleckner of Iowa touched a chord with
many when he observed, half-jokingly, that &quot;the Bible says
we ought to tithe and give 10% to the Lord.  I have a hard time
with the concept of giving more to government than we're asked
to give to God.&quot;
<p>
We suspect that most taxpayers have reached
their conviction that taxes are too high not by consulting their
history books or the Scriptures, but simply by comparing their
weekly paychecks to their family budgets and counting all the
sacrifices they must make simply to pay the government.  While
any new tax code must raise sufficient revenue to run the government,
it must also be mindful of the burdens these taxes place on America's
working families.  One way to reduce this burden would be to restrain
government spending.   By restoring the balance of power between
the federal government and the citizens who pay its bills, we
can restore basic faith in the system and keep the tax rate low.
<P>
<B>SIMPLICITY
<p>
 <I>...Because life is too short and peace of mind
too precious to waste your time and lose your temper trying to
figure out your taxes.</I></B> 
<p>
Filing tax returns will never be
anyone's favorite pastime, but neither should it be what it has
become: one of life's most nerve-wracking, gut-wrenching, and
mind-numbing chores.  With a simpler system, taxpayers will be
able to file their returns on a single piece of paper in less
time than it takes to finish your morning crossword puzzle.
<p>
As detailed earlier, the current tax code is exceedingly expensive
to comply with, increasingly difficult to enforce, and  nearly
impossible to understand. Ambiguities and inconsistencies in the
current tax code increase the likelihood that taxpayers will make
mistakes and fall victim to enforcement techniques considered
by many to be infringements of personal liberties. Long ago the
authors of the <I>Federalist Papers</I> warned, &quot;It will
be of little avail to the people that the laws are made by men
of their own choice if the laws be so voluminous that they cannot
be read, or so incoherent that they cannot be understood.&quot;
 A simplified, fairer tax system will let Americans get a handle
on their taxes, a grip on their government, and a hold of their
future.
<P>
<B>NEUTRALITY
<p>
 <I>...Because the tax code should not pick winners
or play favorites, but allow people freely to make decisions based
on their own needs and dreams.</I></B>
<p>
The tax code should be used
to raise revenue to run the government while doing the least possible
damage to the economy.  This means leaving individuals free to
make decisions and to set priorities based on economic reality
- not on the bureaucratic whims of Washington, D.C.
<p>
Taxes cannot help but raise the cost of everything they fall on.  But at least
they should fall on things neutrally without penalizing one form
of economic behavior and promoting another.  As Senator Robert
Bennett of Utah recently pointed out, &quot;Neutrality means that
the tax code should not be used to punish the bad guys and reward
the good guys.  We have other laws for that.&quot;  Unfortunately,
the current code strives to act as economic traffic cop -- giving
green lights to certain economic activities and red lights to
others. 
<p>
The result of the biases and distortions in the current
system is to make the market less free, the system less fair,
and families less financially secure.  As Frank Hayes, a public
accountant who testified before the commission in Omaha, remarked:
&quot;If there's a way to make things simpler and take the tax
aspect out of making day-to-day decisions, I think everybody would
become productive.&quot;
<p>
Perhaps the single most irrational and
economically damaging aspect of today's code is the layer upon
layer of taxes on saving and investment. By hitting income saved
and invested harder and more frequently than income consumed,
the current system prompts taxpayers to spend today what they
might otherwise save for tomorrow. This is particularly alarming
considering the problems facing public retirement programs and
the need to strengthen private retirement saving. The Bipartisan
Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform offered analyses and
proposals on this subject.
<P>
<B>VISIBILITY 
<P>
<I>...Because those who pay the price of government
have a right to see the bill.</I></B>
<p>
The history of hidden taxes, rapidly rising rates, and perpetual budget deficits proves that
what you don't know can hurt you.  The current system hides the
cost of government behind a chronic deficit and a maddening multiplicity
of taxes - many of which are virtually invisible to the taxpayer
who pays them.  How much did we pay in payroll taxes last year?
What excise taxes were hidden in the prices of the products we
bought?  What are the tax cost of exclusions, deductions, and
corporate income taxes?  Few of us know the answers. 
<P>
When it comes
to these hidden levies, ignorance is expensive bliss indeed.
<p>
One of the biggest political fictions in American history is the progressive
taxation of &quot;Mr. Nobody&quot; - the illusion that &quot;painless&quot;
taxes can be levied on businesses and on the goods and services
they sell. But goods and services do not pay taxes.  People do.
While businesses collect taxes, the burden of paying the &quot;business&quot;
taxes ultimately falls on each one of us as investors, workers,
or consumers.
<p>
Moreover, the invisibility of many taxes perpetuates
the fantasy that government is free -- even as its real costs shrink
our paychecks, sap our savings, drain our economy, and inflate
the budget deficit to ominous proportions.  Bob Genetski, an economist
and author who testified at hearings in Omaha, told the commission:
&quot;The cost of government is not obvious to people.  If you
hide the cost of government, people are going to demand more government
than they otherwise would.&quot; By severing the connection between
government's cost and its consumption, the current system deprives
citizens of the information they need in order to make rational
choices about what they want to buy from Washington and how much
they are willing to spend.
<p>
A visible system gives taxpayers an
<I>honest accounting</I> of government's expense and will make
it far more difficult for politicians to tinker with the tax code
without the democratic consent of those taxed.  
<p>
The incurable cynic H.L. Mencken once said, &quot;Conscience is the inner voice
which warns us somebody may be looking.&quot;  By  making taxes
visible, we can ensure that someone always will be.
<P>
<B>STABILITY
<p>
 <I>...Because taxpayers should be able to plan for
their future without the rules being changed in the middle of
the game.</I></B>
<p>
Everyone has heard the old saw that there are
only two things in life that are certain: death and taxes.  Given
the constant changes to the tax code over the past few decades,
the certainty of taxes has taken a perverse twist.  Like walking
blindfolded down a ship's gangplank, you know the end is out there
-- you just don't know when it'll arrive, how far you'll fall,
or how long you'll be able to keep your head above water.
<p>
This uncertainty has a debilitating effect on the economy, making it
very difficult for families and businesses, particularly  small
businesses, to plan for their future with confidence.  This exacts
a tremendous cost from those taxpayers and business owners who
must struggle to keep up with ever-shifting rules and regulations.
The retroactive tax increases passed in 1993 packed a double-whammy
- changing the rules when the game was half over. A stable tax
code must allow individuals to start a business, buy a house,
take out a loan, put money into savings, or plan for their children's
education without fear of what might lurk behind the next election
cycle.
<P>
<center><hr width=50%></center>
<P>
We know what works...Freedom works.  And only principles for tax
reform that maximize freedom can yield the opportunities, economic
growth, and untold possibilities for human advancement that are
its fruits.  In his last public address, Abraham Lincoln declared
that, &quot;Important principles may and must be inflexible.&quot;
 By laying down these important principles, this commission hopes
to help build a future of growing prosperity for many generations
to come.

<h3>A NEW TAX SYSTEM FOR THE 21ST CENTURY</h3>
<blockquote>
<HR>

<P>
<B>RECOMMENDATIONS</B>
</center><p>

Among the hundreds of testimonies and citizen
letters reviewed by this commission, one of the most compelling
was that of Van Woods, owner of Sylvia's Restaurant.  Mr. Woods
and his family run a successful soul food establishment in the
heart of Harlem, a community with painfully high unemployment.
In concluding his testimony to the commission, he said, &quot;Opportunity
is the ability to look in the face of my son and say: 'I don't
know if you <I>will</I> succeed, but you <I>can</I>.'&quot; 
<p>
The objective of this commission, the aim of its members, is to help
make that promise a reality -- not just for Mr. Woods' children,
but for every child in every neighborhood in America's 21st century.
<p>
In submitting these recommendations, the commission does not seek
to toss yet another piece of legislation on the table.  Nor was
its goal to pick and choose among existing plans, or worse, create
a hodgepodge compromise from elements of existing alternatives.
 What we are offering to the American people and their elected
officials is a set of standards - a quality control - that any
new plan must meet if it is to meet the bold objective of replacing
the current tax code with a fair and simple system.  The preceding
chapter provides one half of the check-list: the principles that
any new system should embody.  This chapter provides the other
half: key recommendations that any new system should follow.
<p>
The core recommendations of the National Commission on Economic Growth
and Tax Reform are:
<P><ul>
<B><li> Adopt a single, low tax rate with a generous personal exemption</B>
<P>
<B><li>Lower the tax burden on America's working families and remove
it on those least able to pay</B>
<P>
<B><li>End biases against work, saving, and investment</B>
<P>
<B><li>Allow full deductibility of the payroll tax for working men
and women</B>
<P>
<B><li>Require a two-thirds super-majority vote in Congress to increase
tax rates</B>
</ul><p>
 We believe that, with a pro-growth, pro-family tax
system, we can achieve these goals within the context of budget
equilibrium. The commission believes that this new tax system
can satisfy our six working principles:
<P><ul>
<li> <B>Economic growth</B> through incentives to work, save, and
invest;
<P>
<li> <B>Fairness</B> for all taxpayers;
<P>
<li> <B>Simplicity</B> so that anyone can figure it out;
<P>
<li> <B>Neutrality</B> so that people and not government can make
choices;
<P>
<li><B>Visibility</B> so that people know the cost of government;
and
<P>
<li> <B>Stability</B> so that people can plan for their future. 
</ul><p>
The following pages explain the core recommendations in light of these
principles, and explore some of the trade-offs involved in reaching
a system that meets these goals.  This chapter also touches on
a few of the corollary points that flow from these main recommendations.
  Staff discussion papers are provided for those who seek more
detail on the concepts involved.
<P>
<B>RECOMMENDATIONS 
<p>
<I>Single Tax Rate.</I></B> A single rate is
a fair rate. One tax rate, coupled with a generous personal exemption,
together produce a progressive average tax rate. Low income taxpayers
would owe little or no tax.  But everyone who earns enough to
cross the threshold of the exemption would face exactly the same
tax rate on any additional income.
<p>
A single-rate system is not only fair, it also can satisfy the principles of simplicity, visibility,
and stability.  A single rate is clearly simple, and it is highly
visible: one rate -- as opposed to the current, confusing mess-
will stand out and be remembered by all.  A simple, visible system
also can be stable: by keeping our eyes on the single rate, we
can keep politicians' hands off it.  
<p>
Nobel Prize-winning economist F.A. Hayek described economic redistribution through multiple
tax rates as &quot;the chief source of irresponsibility&quot;
in politics and &quot;the crucial issue on which the whole character
of future society will depend.&quot;  A system of graduated marginal
rates violates the principle of fairness -- that if a law applies
to citizen A, it must equally apply to citizen B.
<P>
Take, for example, two wheat producers, each farming the same-sized plot of land.
 One of them produces 1,000 bushels of wheat; the other, through
harder work and more careful land management, produces 1,200 bushels.
 To tax the income represented by the additional 200 bushels of
wheat more heavily than the income represented by the first 1,000
would be demonstrably unfair to the more productive farmer.  And
yet, that is the nature of a multi-rate tax system: it takes more
from  people for their hard work, creativity, and success.
<P>
The added output -- and the resulting added income -- of one taxpayer
does  not diminish his neighbor, and is not earned  at his neighbor's
expense.  Indeed, it expands economic opportunity, increases the
availability of goods and services, and helps others be more productive
as well.
<P>
<I>True</I> progressivity requires a low tax rate coupled
with a generous personal exemption.  This would grant low-income
Americans an &quot;economic head-start&quot; -- allowing them to
begin their climb toward economic independence before they are
asked to shoulder their share of government's cost.  The larger
goal is to move beyond merely maintaining low income Americans
at subsistence level livelihoods toward giving them an opportunity
to permanently escape poverty.
<P>
Here, as elsewhere, there are trade-offs
involved.  The goal of protecting those least able to bear the
burden of taxation conflicts with the principle of visibility:
those exempt from taxes don't see the price of the government
services we all pay for.  The commission believes that the costs
-- both economic and moral -- of burdening low-income people with
taxes that can bar them from reaching their fullest potential
outweigh competing concerns.  By offering low-income Americans
a window of economic opportunity, the personal exemption can help
liberate those whom the public sector has failed to help and the
private sector has failed to reach.
<p>
<I><B>Lower Tax Rates.</B></I>
 The commission recommends that the single rate be as low as possible.
 We encourage the adoption of such a low rate within the framework
of budget  equilibrium.  Furthermore, we strongly urge that the
rate be lowered over time as a growing economy yields rising revenues.<I>
 We recommend that added revenues be considered, not as more Monopoly
money for Washington, but as a &quot;growth dividend&quot; to
be paid out to the American people.
<p>
 <B>Eliminate biases against work, saving, and investment.</B></I> The principles of fairness
and neutrality require that all income be taxed the same, whether
it is used for consumption or saving, whether it is produced in
small businesses or large corporations, and whether it is earned
by employees or the self employed.
<p>
Under the current system, income that is used for consumption is taxed once, while income that
is saved is taxed again and again.  For businesses, complex depreciation
rules mean that income from investment in buildings and equipment
is overstated. This forces people to pay taxes before they have
recovered the cost of their investment.

<blockquote><HR>
<center><b>BIAS AGAINST SAVING AND INVESTMENT</b>  
</center>

Multiple taxation creates a huge bias against saving and investment
that must be eliminated in a new system.  Consider, for example,
the effect of the current system on a family in the 28 percent
tax bracket that earns an extra $1,000. <p>

Of that $1,000, they will pay $280 in federal income tax and keep $720. If they spend that $720, say, 
taking the family to Disneyland, they incur no further federal tax, no matter how many times they ride the 
Space Mountain.
<P>
But suppose, instead, they decide to invest the income in stocks to create financial security for their future. 
Bad move, says the current tax code.
<p>
<b>First</b>, they already had to pay income taxes to have the $720 to invest. <b>Second</b>, the 
company in which they invest wll generally pay tax at a 35 percent rate on the returns on the amount 
invested. <b>Third</b>, if the company pays dividends, the family will pay a 28 percent tax on the 
dividends they receive. Alternatively, if the company retains the after tax income for reinvestment or finds 
other ways to boost future eaernings, the stock price will rise. The future earnings will be taxed, and if the 
family sells the stock, it will pay a capital gains tax on a 28 percent rate (see below). <b>Fourth</b>, if 
they hold the proceeds of the sale until death, they will be subject to an estate tax that can go as high as 55 
percent.
<p>
Both the investment in the stock market and the investment in the family trip produce returns -- one yields 
warm memories of the past, the other provides real hope for the future. The returns on the investment in the 
trip are not subject to tax;  the returns on the investment in the stock market are. (Staff discussion papers 
contain further information on the tax code's bias against savings and investment.)
<hr></blockquote>
<p>
The box above provides an example of the problems created by the current tax code.
<p>
The biases result in less work, savings, and investment, lower productivity and wages, fewer jobs, less 
income to spend on housing and education, and fewer assets to furnish income in retirement than would 
otherwise be the case. As the example at left demonstrates, these biases affect every family that is trying to 
save for the future.
<p>
In order to end these biases, the tax system must either <i>let savers deduct their savings or exclude the 
returns on the savings from their taxable income</i>. It must <i>end double-taxation of businesses and 
their owners</i> and <i>permit expensing of investment outlays</i>. it must also address the following 
issues:
<p>
<b><i>Capital Gains Taxes</i></b>.  If a new tax system is to eliminate biases against savings and 
investment, it must also <b>abolish separate taxation of capital gains</b>. As commissioner Ted 
Forstmann said, "The biggest  depressant on the rate of capital formation is the risk of confiscation by the 
government." The United States now imposes some of the highest tax rates on capital of any developed 
nation -- a 28 percent tax on long-term capital gains unindexed for inflation.  Compare that with a 16 
percent rate
in France; a 1 percent rate in Japan; and a zero tax on capital
gains in Hong Kong, Germany, South Korea, Singapore, and Malaysia.
<p>
The result is to punish risk-taking, shrink the pool of capital
needed for investment, and deprive would-be entrepreneurs of a
chance to climb the ladder of economic opportunity.  &quot;The
tax on capital gains,&quot; argued President Kennedy in 1963,
&quot;directly affects investment decisions, the mobility and
the flow of risk capital...the ease or difficulty experienced
by new ventures in obtaining capital, and thereby the strength
and potential for growth in the economy.&quot;
<p>
By shrinking the
supply of available seed corn, the capital gains tax acts as a
future tax on wealth to be realized, businesses to be built, and
jobs to be created.  Those hardest hit are not the wealthy -- who
by definition have their capital gains, their wealth, behind them
-- but rather all those who have yet to realize their capital gains:
the poor, the young, and minorities.
<P>
<i>&quot;Death&quot; Taxes</i>.  It makes little sense and is patently unfair to impose extra taxes
on people who choose to pass their assets on to their children
and grandchildren instead of spending them lavishly on themselves.
Families faced with these confiscatory taxes often find themselves
forced to sell off farms or businesses, destroying jobs in the
process.  &quot;We must help to save the family farm, ranch, and
business,&quot; said Commissioner Jack Faris.  
<p>
Unfortunately, family businesses often get hit hardest because they can't afford
to hire expensive lawyers and accountants.  As Douglas Darch of
Wake Forest, North Carolina testified to the commission: &quot;There
is something wrong with a tax system that results in the systematic
dismantling of small businesses to meet estate tax obligations.&quot;
<P>
The tragedy is that while these taxes cause much suffering for taxpaying
families, they generate a relatively small amount of revenue.
 Estate and gift taxes appear to count for less than 1% of federal
revenues -- but even that low figure is exaggerated and misleading.
 Professor Douglas Bernheim of Stanford University testified before
the commission that the estate tax may not really raise any revenue
at all, because more income tax is lost from &quot;estate planning&quot;
than is ultimately collected at death.
<p>
<b><i>Full Deductibility of Payroll Taxes for All Working Americans</i></b>

.The Commission recommends that
federal payroll taxes be fully deductible - both for employers
and employees.  Many employers and employees pay more in payroll
taxes than they do in federal income taxes.  Making these taxes
deductible  for both employers and employees will reduce obstacles
to hiring more workers and will fuel America's job growth into
the 21st century.
<p>
Under the current tax system, workers pay income
tax on their Social Security tax  -- a tax on a tax.  Employers
can deduct their half of the payroll tax, but employees cannot.
 The combined burden of both income and Social Security tax is
particularly hard on workers with incomes too high to be eligible
for the Earned Income Tax Credit (roughly $25,000), but too low
to be below the threshold where the Social Security tax stops
being taken out of paychecks (about $63,000).
<p>
When employer and
employee payroll taxes of 15.3% are taken into account, workers
in the 28% tax bracket actually face a brutal marginal tax rate
of more than 43% on any additional income they earn.  A single
low tax rate would help relieve this demoralizing tax penalty
on work and saving.  But it still leaves a tax on a tax.
<p>
Making the Social Security tax deductible would help reduce the combined
marginal tax rates on middle-income taxpayers who get hit by both
taxes.   A one-earner couple with a $40,000  income currently
pays tax as though the couple really received  the entire $40,000
- even though they have already paid over $3,000 as their share
of the payroll tax, leaving less than $37,000 on which they could
possibly pay income taxes.   By making the payroll tax deductible,
income taxes would be calculated on the basis of  working families'
real net incomes.  
<p>
This need for change was highlighted in a citizen
letter to the commission from Spencer Riedel of Flagstaff, Arizona,
who described the Social Security payroll tax as &quot;a huge
heartache...Is there no way to stop this 'hidden' tax?...If we
could eliminate this unfair mandated tax, our business would hire
two more people.&quot;
<p>
<b><i>A Two-Thirds Majority Vote in Congress To Raise The Tax Rate.</i></b>  The commission 
recommends that the new system
be guaranteed both stability and longevity by requiring a super-majority
vote of both houses of Congress to raise the rate.
<p>
In hearings across the country, one depressing but all-too-familiar response
from taxpayers could be bluntly paraphrased as: &quot;Change,
schmange.  That's what you guys said the last time you talked
about tax reform.&quot;  The roller-coaster ride of tax policy
in the past few decades has fed citizens' cynicism about the possibility
of real, long-term reform, while fueling frustration with Washington.
 The initial optimism inspired by the low rates of the 1986 Tax
Reform Act soured into disillusionment and anger when taxes subsequently
were hiked two times in less than seven years. The commission
believes that a two-thirds super-majority vote of Congress will
earn Americans' confidence in the longevity, predictability, and
stability of any new tax system.
<p>
<b>The goal:  A single low rate on
income with a generous personal exemption, a lower burden on working
families,  an end to biases in the tax code -- all set in the stone
of a congressional super-majority.  The recommendations in this
chapter form the core framework for a new 21st century tax system.
</b>
<P>
<B>OTHER ISSUES
<p>
 <I>Deductions and Exclusions</I></B> Concerns about
special provisions in the existing tax code have the potential
to derail debate over the merits of a new tax system and the tremendous
benefits it could bring to the American economy.  There are important
social and economic consequences of certain deductions and exclusions.
 The commission believes they should be considered with an eye
to their impact on the tax rate, the costs to the Treasury, and
the consequences of change -- and within the context of the values
of the American people.  For example, the home mortgage interest
deduction has spurred home ownership in America; an important
goal of our commission is to spread ownership to give more people
a stake in the system. And, at a time when America needs a renaissance
of private giving and commitment to overcome those social problems
which government programs have either failed to improve or made
worse -- we need a system which encourages people to take more
responsibility for communities and neighbors in need.  We welcome
debate over the best way to protect these institutions and preserve
the values they represent within the context of the dynamic new
tax system we envision.
<p>
<I><B>Simplify International Taxation:</B></I> Congress should consider a territorial tax system.  The 
current system of taxing international business operations is one of the
most complicated parts of the Internal Revenue Code.  It leads
to enormous costs of compliance and enforcement, raises little
revenue, and damages the competitiveness of U.S. businesses operating
abroad.  Further, it encourages them to keep reinvesting profits
abroad rather than bringing the money back home where it could
be reinvested in America.
<p>
Whatever new tax system is chosen, there
must be a clearer, simpler, and more certain determination, relative
to current practice, of what income is foreign or domestic or
what international transaction is taxable.  In addition, attention
must be given to the proper tax treatment of foreign source license
fees, royalties, and other intangibles so as not to discourage
research and development in the United States.
<p>
<I><B>Strengthen Private Retirement Saving:</B></I>  The commission is particularly
concerned that Americans are not saving enough for their own retirement.
A tax system that eliminates the bias against saving is essential
to encourage people to accumulate more assets throughout their
lives.  There is, however, no guarantee that all individuals or
families will save enough to be secure and financially independent
in their retirement, even under a new tax system. 
<p>
With the problems
facing public retirement programs, it is essential that private
retirement saving be strengthened.  Without sufficient retirement
saving, many people will become dependent upon the government
in their old age, necessitating either sharp increases in taxes
on future generations or a significantly diminished standard of
living. Providing strong encouragement for individuals and families
to take responsibility for their own retirement will go a long
way toward preventing uncontrolled growth of government while
ensuring a more comfortable, more secure, and more independent
retirement.
<p>
Therefore, any tax system should encourage people to
save for their own retirement.   Further, the commission recommends
that Congress begin the process of policy changes that will result
in people taking more responsibility for their own retirement
saving. Other changes within the overall income and payroll tax
systems also should be considered.
<P>
<B>MEASURING RESULTS</B>
<p>
One of the chief objectives of adopting
a new tax system is to promote economic growth.  If we are successful,
the added growth will provide the tax revenues to pay for a portion
of the change in the tax law.  Failure to count these added revenues
will make it appear more difficult to make the necessary tax changes.
<p>
One couldn't catch the blossoming of a rose in a split-second single-frame
exposure, or capture a speeding bullet with time-lapse photography.
 Similarly, the tools with which we anticipate and examine changes
in government policies, including tax policy, must mirror the
way the economy actually changes as a result of these actions.
<p>

When a bill is being debated before Congress, members are required
to produce estimates of the costs of the legislation.  For years,
Congress has used what are called &quot;static revenue estimates&quot;
to produce these figures. Static revenue estimates attempt to
predict future government revenues by applying the new law to
today's economy as though it would not be affected by the new
law.  History has shown that these estimates are limited in their
ability to predict revenues. 
<p>
We recommend that Congress instead
use estimates that measure the impact  policy changes will have
on people's behavior and on future economic activity, and that
therefore more accurately predict implications for future revenue
collections. Use of this &quot;dynamic&quot; scoring, of course,
must be based upon realistic assumptions regarding tax rates,
tax revenues, and economic activity. It is essential to avoid
overly optimistic as well as overly pessimistic projections. (Further
details are provided in the staff discussion papers.)
<P>
<B>TRANSITION ISSUES</B>
<p>
The defenders of the status quo will say
that our recommendations for a new tax system will mean a tax
increase on the middle class or cause a flood of red ink. 
<p>
 We strongly disagree. The thinking behind our current tax system
is a model that does not fit tomorrow's world. Complainers fail
to understand the new world that this new system will create.
The tax reform we envision will create a different climate for
economic growth.  It will lift incomes.  It will reduce interest
rates.  It will put people to work.  It will reduce the use of
tax shelters.  It will reduce the need for social safety-net spending.
 It will foster millions of new businesses and jobs. In the process,
the transition will help to pay for itself.
<p>
That doesn't mean there will not be difficult issues to address during the transition.
 In particular, policy makers must take care to protect existing
savings, investments, and other assets.  Whatever the challenges
this change presents, we believe that none of the issues is insurmountable.
<p>
Whatever equivocations there may be toward the future, we must not let
them rob us of the unparalleled economic growth, the unimagined
opportunities for human fulfillment and advancement that now lay
trapped within the cage of the current system, waiting for us
to open the door.
<P>
<B>CONCLUSION</B>
<p>
The recommendations outlined here can lay the
groundwork for a pro-growth, pro-family tax code for America's
21st century.  As construction of the new system moves forward,
there will be many decisions to be met and made along the way.
 While we have tried to raise a number of those issues here, 
and clarify others in the discussion papers, it is impossible
to anticipate every question that will arise as we move toward
a new system.
<p>
We urge that the American people participate in this
debate at every step of the way.  This is all the more crucial
given the critical nature of the transition issues involved as
replacement of the current system gets underway.  Half a century
ago, the economist Joseph Schumpeter described capitalism as inseparable
from &quot;the perennial gale of creative destruction.&quot; 
In the transition to a fairer system and a freer market, the winds
of change are bound to increase.  Those who have a stake in the
status quo will not welcome change; others may prefer the cramped
confines of the familiar present to the uncertainty of a yet realized
future.
<p>
If the taxpayer testimonies we listened to and letters
we received bear any evidence of the broader mood of the country,
we believe that Americans are overwhelmingly eager to make that
change, ready for its challenges, and look forward to its <BR>
opportunities.
<p>
It has been a privilege for us to serve on this
commission, and each of us has taken the responsibility very seriously.
 We have been educated and inspired by the many, many Americans
we have talked with.  While the tax system is in serious disrepair,
the American spirit and will for change are stronger than ever.
 We thank Senate Majority Leader Dole and Speaker Gingrich for
giving us this opportunity by delegating us to do this important
work. 
<p>
 We quote in this report many of the citizen witnesses who
wrote to us and who testified at our hearing.  We thank them and
the many expert witnesses who prepared testimony and answered
our many questions about the intricacies of tax reform. We are
very much indebted to the lawmakers who have spent years of their
careers studying tax reform, inspiring serious debate on the flaws
of the current system, and developing proposals for major tax
reform.  Among them:  House Majority Leader Dick Armey, Ways and
Means Chairman Bill Archer, Senate Budget Chairman Pete Domenici,
Senator Sam Nunn, Joint Economic Committee Chairman Connie Mack,
Senator Bob Bennett, and Congressman Dick Gephardt.  Others whose
work has been invaluable to the process include Senator Richard
Shelby, Senator Richard Lugar, Senator Arlen Specter, ranking
Ways and Means Committee member Sam Gibbons, and many others.
<P>

<p>
It has been said that every breakthrough in human understanding
has come in the form of a simplification.  The complex, bureaucratic
tax code of the 20th century will not enable us to keep pace with
the complex and rapidly changing world of the 21st century.  A
simplified tax code would have an instant impact on peoples' lives
-freeing up time, energy and resources currently wasted in costly
compliance for productive endeavors.
<p>
The impact on the economy
would be immediate and profound, putting the goal of a doubled
economic growth rate within our reach.  The moment the dead weight
and distortions of the current tax system are lifted from our
economy, the explosion of new investment, new businesses, and
new jobs would transform the economic and social landscape of
our country.  A newly galvanized economy would create work for
all those who wanted it, unleash unimagined innovations,  act
as a magnet for capital from all over the world, and boost wages
and living standards for America's working families.
<p>
We also believe that a new tax code can help replenish the wellsprings of public
trust - in our government, in each other, and in ourselves.  By
treating citizens equally and with respect, a new tax code can
restore faith in the basic fairness of the system.  A simplified
system will eliminate the fear that special advantages hide in
complexity, while restoring citizens' confidence in their own
ability to comply with the code.
<p>
This vision of the future is rooted in both a realism about human nature and an idealism about human
potential.  We recognize that a new tax code, no matter how radical,
cannot solve all problems.  It cannot make fathers love mothers
or guarantee children happy homes.  Government reform, however
vast or vaunted, cannot change hearts. 
<p>
 But it can lift hopes. At its best, it does this by seeking, as Lincoln did, &quot;to
elevate the condition of men -- to lift artificial weights from
all shoulders -- to clear the paths of laudable pursuit for all.&quot;
<P>
By freeing citizens from the costly encumbrances of the current
tax code, by restoring the link between effort and reward, by
allowing individuals to save and invest in their future, and by
unleashing the pent up power of our economy, this new system can
 lead to Lincoln's &quot;new birth of freedom,&quot; and launch
us into the next American century.

<center><h3>BIOGRAPHIES</h3>
</center>
<blockquote>
<HR>
<p>
Chairman <b><i>Jack Kemp</i></b> is founder and current co-director of Empower
America, a public policy and advocacy organization.  Kemp served
as Secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
in the Bush Administration, and represented the Buffalo, N.Y.,
area for 18 years in the U.S. House of Representatives.  He played
professional football for 13 years as quarterback for the San
Diego Chargers and Buffalo Bills.  His father was a small-businessman
who helped start a small trucking company in and around Los Angeles,
CA.    
<P>
<I>&quot;If you tax something, you get less of it.  If you subsidize
something, you get more if it.  The problem in America today is
that we are taxing work, savings, investment, and productivity;
and we're subsidizing debt, welfare, consumption, leisure, and
mediocrity.&quot;
<p>
</I>Vice Chairman <I><B>Edwin J. Feulner, Jr.</B></I>
is president of <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a>, a leading public policy
group in Washington, D.C.  He also serves as chairman of the Institute
for European Defense and Strategic Studies in London.  Feulner,
who has a Ph.D. from the University of Edinburgh, served as consultant
for Domestic Policy to President Reagan, and was the Chairman
of the U.S. Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy.  
<P>
<I>&quot;Our tax code has become a complex web of penalties, disincentives,
loopholes, and preferences.  No amount of tinkering at the edges
will save the system.  The only answer is to replace it with a
new system that rewards work, saving and risk-taking.&quot;  
<p>
<B>Loretta H. Adams</B></I> started her professional career as a management
trainee at the Panama City, Panama, Sears store on a $25-a-week
salary.  Ms. Adams later immigrated to the United States and went
on to become founder of the San Diego-based Market Development,
Inc., a consumer, marketing, and opinion research firm with nearly
100 employees.  Since 1978, her company has serviced Latin-American
consumers in the United States and Latin America and has become
one of the top 100 research firms in the country.   
<P>
<I>&quot;The conditions that produced the current tax system no
longer contribute positively to a 21st century global economy.
 We now have the opportunity to create a tax system that is more
responsive to our times, situation, and needs and, hopefully,
we will grasp it fully.&quot;
<p>
<B>J. Kenneth Blackwell</B></I> lived
in public housing for the first seven years of his life only to
later pioneer housing reforms as the Deputy Undersecretary of
the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.  Today,
he serves as Treasurer of the State of Ohio, having previously
held public office on the Cincinnati City Council before becoming
mayor of Cincinnati.  He is a member of the Council on Foreign
Relations in New York, and previously served as U.S. Ambassador
to the United Nations Human Rights Commission and as vice president
of Xavier University in Cincinnati.   
<P>
<I>&quot;There is something fundamentally wrong with a tax system
that costs Americans $250 billion to comply.  A simpler tax system
would help break the chains that currently bind entrepreneurial
spirit.&quot;</I> 
<p>
<I><B>Herman Cain</B></I> learned the value
of hard work from his father who concurrently worked three jobs
- one of which was as a janitor at The Pillsbury Company in Atlanta.
 At age 12, Herman went to work with his father at Pillsbury,
helping him as &quot;assistant janitor.&quot;  Twenty-two years
later Cain would become a Pillsbury vice president (computer systems)
and later be selected as president of the firm's then-subsidiary
company, Godfather's Pizza, Inc. In 1988, he successfully led
a group of Godfather's Pizza, Inc. senior management in purchasing
the chain from Pillsbury.  He currently serves as chairman and
CEO of Godfather's Pizza, Inc. Prior to his tenure at Godfather's,
Cain worked for the U.S. Navy as a mathematician, the Coca-Cola
Company as a business analyst, and was an executive with Burger
King Corporation.   
<P>
<I>&quot;One of America's greatest strengths is its ability to
change...our 82 year old tax 'mess' is long overdue for dramatic,
sensible change.&quot; </I> 
<p>
<I><B>Carroll Campbell</B></I> served
two, four-year terms as one of the most popular and innovative
governors in South Carolina's history.  His legacy as governor
includes government reform, record job expansion, net tax cuts,
economic growth, and investment in his state.  Campbell launched
his political career in 1970, first serving in the state House
and Senate and later in the U.S. Congress, where he served on
the Banking, Appropriations, and Ways and Means committees.  He
also served as chairman of the National Governors' Association,
the Republican Governors' Association, and the Southern Governors'
Association, as well as Chairman of the Southern Growth Policies
Board.  Today he is president and CEO of the American Council
of Life Insurance.  
<P>
<I>&quot;The tax system should encourage investment and job creation,
foster long-term savings, and increase the focus on individual
and family economic responsibility.  In short, tax policy should
encourage long-term savings for retirement.&quot;
<p>
<B>Pete du Pont</B></I>,
during his tenure as governor of Delaware from 1977-1985, implemented
a highly successful pro-growth tax policy by dramatically lowering
marginal tax rates, causing the state's economy to boom and overall
tax collections to jump, and enacting a constitutional amendment
that limited both tax and state spending increases.  He also served
as a state legislator and Congressman and ran as a Republican
candidate for President of the United States.  He currently serves
as policy chairman of the National Center for Policy Analysis,
and writes a weekly column on public policy that is distributed
to more than four hundred newspapers across the nation.   
<P>
<I>&quot;The men and women who spoke to us reflected an American
consensus:  Our tax system is destroying our opportunities.  It's
time to replace it.&quot;
<p>
<B>Jack Faris</B></I> started working
at age 13 earning 50 cents an hour at his parent's service station.
Faris learned early in life the challenges of running a small
family business and the importance of hard work. After running
his own business in Nashville, Tennessee, he became president
and CEO of the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB),
the nation's largest small business advocacy organization with
more than 600,000 members.  
<P>
<I>&quot;Regulation and taxes are strangling small business on
main street.  Give us relief and we will create the jobs and build
America's future for our children and grandchildren.&quot;  </I>
<P>
<i><B>Matt Fong</B></I> serves as Treasurer of the State of California.
 Prior to his election, Fong served as Vice Chairman of the State
Board of Equalization, California's tax agency.   Fong streamlined
the agency, cutting millions of dollars of waste, reformed the
state's tax code sponsoring changes to the unitary tax, and made
the agency more &quot;taxpayer friendly.&quot;  A graduate of
the U.S. Air Force Academy currently holding the rank of Lt. Col.
USAFR, he earned an MBA and law degree, started a small business,
and worked for Sheppard, Mullin, Richtor and Hampton as a transactional
corporate attorney. 
<P>
<I>&quot;Too many Americans are sitting on the economic sidelines.
 A progressive single rate flat tax will radically jump start
job creation, moving the unemployed off the sidelines to jobs.&quot;
<p>
<B>Theodore J. Forstmann</B></I> is one of the most admired entrepreneurs
in America with an unrivaled record of successful investments.
 Forstmann splits his time between running his firm, speaking
out on behalf of economic opportunity and growth, and helping
children worldwide.  He has poured his energies and resources
into leading relief efforts in Bosnia, sponsoring charities in
South Africa, and funding scholarships and teaching students in
America's inner cities. He is the senior partner of Forstmann
Little &amp; Co.
<P>
<I> &quot;The current tax system is ridiculously complicated,
economically destructive, and morally corrosive.  We desperately
need a new tax code that puts the individual - not government
- at the center of the equation.&quot;
<p>
<B>Dean Kleckner</B></I>
took over the rented family farm in Iowa at the age of 18 when
his father died. Kleckner served in the Army and later returned
to Iowa where he started on his own with a dozen sows, a dozen
cows and 300 chickens.  Today he owns a 350-acre corn, soybean,
and hog farm, and serves as President of the American Farm Bureau
Federation, a post he has held since 1986.  He also serves on
the U.S. Advisory Committee on Trade Policy, a post to which he
was first appointed by President Reagan, and reappointed by Presidents
Bush and Clinton.  
<P>
<I>&quot;Our tax system must be simple and equitable for all taxpayers,
with no loopholes.  It has to let hard-working taxpayers keep
more of the money they have earned.&quot;
<p>
<B>Shirley Peterson</B></I> is president of Hood College in Frederick, Maryland.  Prior to
assuming the college presidency, she practiced tax law and also
served as Commissioner of Internal Revenue under President Bush
and Assistant Attorney General (Tax Division) at the U.S. Justice
Department under President Bush.  She was raised on farm in Colorado.

<P>
<I>&quot;Citizens from around the country told us that the current
law is too complex.  This complexity breeds disrespect for the
law and for our government.  It time to repeal the Internal Revenue
Code and start over.&quot;
<p>
<B>John Snow</B></I> worked his way
through college as a sports coach.  Today he serves as chairman,
president, and CEO of CSX Corporation in Richmond, Virginia, and
has been with the company since 1977. Snow, who has a Ph.D. in
economics from the University of Virginia and a law degree from
George Washington University, also served as Deputy Undersecretary
of the U.S. Department of Transportation, as a private attorney
and a college professor.
<P>
<I>&quot;The current tax system dims our prospects for the future
and must be replaced by a new system for the 21st century which
helps Americans to capitalize on opportunities - not stifle economic
growth and entrepreneurial activity.&quot;  
<p>
<B>John Wieland</B></I> always worked part-time growing up, from working at a gas station
to delivering newspapers to stocking vending machines. Today,
he is a president of John Wieland Homes, Inc., of Atlanta, employing
more than 700 full-time employees and thousands of subcontractors.
 For Wieland, success has meant the ability to give back to his
community by providing housing for the working poor and working
with Habitat for Humanity, formerly serving as a member of the
International Board of Habitat.  
<P>
<I>&quot;The consensus of the American people demands a completely
new, simple, and fair tax code.  Increased prosperity for ALL
will be the outcome.  The time is now.&quot;</I>

<h2>HISTORICAL LESSONS FOR TAX REFORM</h2>
by Daniel Mitchell</center><P>
<blockquote>
 Tax reform is not a voyage into uncharted waters.  Since the
inception of the income tax, America has experienced dramatic
changes in tax policy on many occasions.  These changes offer
valuable lessons about the impact of tax policy and strongly suggest
that a single rate system will yield great benefits.  The United
States has had three major episodes of individual income tax rate
reductions -- the 1920s, 1960s, and 1980s.  In all three periods,
individual income tax revenues increased in general, and the amount
of taxes paid by the rich rose in particular.  All three periods,
not coincidentally, saw strong economic growth.
<P>
 Periods of rising tax rates, by contrast, are associated with
weaker economic performance and slower revenue growth.  Tax rate
increases in the 1930s, starting with Herbert Hoover's decision
to boost the top rate from 25 percent to 63 percent, contributed
to the economy's misery during the depression years.  Inflation-induced
bracket creep in the 1970s and early 1980s certainly hindered
economic growth in the 1973-1982 period (prior to the 1981 tax
rate reductions and indexing).  Finally, tax increases in the
1990s have resulted in sub-par growth and stagnant incomes.
<P>
 Finally, it is worth noting that John F. Kennedy was right; a
growing economy is the best way to raise earnings and living standards.
 Earnings for all income groups rose during the 1980s once tax
rate reductions went into effect. 
<P>
<B>Looking at the evidence: The 1920s</B>
<P>
 The Revenue Acts of 1921, 1924, and 1926 slashed individual income
tax rates and reduced the top rate from 73 percent to 25 percent.
 Notwithstanding (or perhaps because of) the dramatic reduction
in tax rates, individual income tax revenues increased substantially
during the 1920s, rising from $719 million in 1921 to $1160 million
in 1928, an increase of more than 61 percent (in a period of virtually
no inflation).  The share of the tax burden paid by the rich (those
with incomes of $50,000 and up in those days) rose dramatically,
climbing from 44.2 percent in 1921 to 78.4 percent in 1928.
<P>
 Andrew Mellon, the Treasury Secretary who oversaw the tax cuts,
wrote, &quot;The history of taxation shows that taxes which are
inherently excessive are not paid.  The high rates inevitably
put pressure upon the taxpayer to withdraw his capital from productive
business and invest it in tax-exempt securities or to find other
lawful methods of avoiding the realization of taxable income.
 The result is that the sources of taxation are drying up; wealth
is failing to carry its share of the tax burden; and capital is
being diverted into channels which yield neither revenue to the
Government nor profit to the people.&quot;
<P>
<B>Looking at the evidence: The 1960s</B>
<P>
 
<P>
 President Kennedy proposed a series of individual income tax
rate reductions in 1963 that resulted in legislation that dropped
the top tax rate from 91 percent in 1963 to 70 percent by 1965.
 Income tax revenues grew strongly, climbing by more than 16 percent
between 1963 and 1966.  As happened during the 1920s, the share
of the income tax burden borne by the rich increased.  Tax collections
from those making over $50,000 per year climbed by 57 percent
between 1963 and 1966 while tax collections from those earning
below $50,000 rose 11 percent.  As a result, the &quot;rich&quot;
saw their portion of the income tax burden climb from 11.6 percent
to 15.1 percent.
<P>
 Speaking to the Economic Club in New York in December of 1962,
President Kennedy articulated the principles that also have guided
the National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform.  He
stated that, &quot;Our true choice is not between tax reduction,
on the one hand, and the avoidance of large Federal deficits on
the other.  It is increasingly clear that ... an economy hampered
by restrictive tax rates will never produce enough revenues to
balance our budget just as it will never produce enough jobs or
enough profits.  Surely the lesson of the last decade is that
budget deficits are not caused by wild-eyed spenders but by slow
economic growth and periodic recessions and any new recession
would break all deficit records.  In short, it is a paradoxical
truth that tax rates are too high today and tax revenues are too
low and the soundest way to raise the revenues in the long run
is to cut the rates now.&quot;
<P>
<B>Looking at the evidence: The 1980s and beyond</B>
<P>
 President Reagan presided over two major pieces of tax legislation
which together reduced the top individual income tax rate from
70 percent in 1980 to 28 percent by 1988.  Beginning in January
of 1983, income tax revenues climbed dramatically, increasing
by more than 54 percent by 1989 (28 percent after adjusting for
inflation).  The share of income taxes paid by the top 10 percent
of earners jumped significantly, climbing from 48.0 percent in
1981 to 57.2 percent in 1988.  The top 1 percent saw their share
of the income tax bill climb even more dramatically, from 17.6
percent in 1981 to 27.5 percent in 1988.
<P>
 The imposition of higher tax rates in recent years, however,
has resulted in a weaker economy.  Ironically, even though tax
rate increases in 1990 and 1993 were supposed to make the &quot;rich&quot;
pay more, the rate increases have backfired.  In 1991, for instance,
income taxes paid by those earning more than $200,000 fell by
6.1 percent while income taxes paid by those with lower earnings
rose by 1 percent.  The adverse consequences of the 1990 tax increase
are being matched by similar evidence from the 1993 tax increase.
 According to recently-released IRS data, taxable income among
those with earnings of less than $200,000 climbed by 3.3 percent
between 1992 and 1993.  For those with earnings over $200,000,
however, taxable income declined by 2.3 percent.
<P>
 The combination of the two record tax increases has been particularly
discouraging.  The deficit is higher today than it was when President
Reagan left office.  It may turn out that deficits are higher
because tax increases caused revenues to fall.  Consider this
evidence: Individual income tax revenues totaled 8.6 percent of
economic output in 1989.  By 1994 -- two large tax increases later
-- individual income tax revenues had fallen to 8.2 percent of
economic output. 
<P>
 It is said that those who forget history's mistakes are doomed
to repeat them.  Conversely, those who recognize the successes
of the past will be better positioned to move the country forward
in the future. The commission's report can point the way to build
on the successes of previous improvements in tax policy.

<h2>BENEFITS OF A SINGLE TAX RATE SYSTEM</h2>
by Daniel Mitchell
</center><P>
<blockquote>
 The widespread recognition that high tax rates hinder economic
growth has contributed to the growing support for tax reform.
 Does this mean, however, that a new tax system cannot have more
than one rate?  If low tax rates are important, then would not
a tax code with rates of 10 percent and 20 percent be just as
good as a flat tax of 15 percent?  And would not a system with
rates of 15 percent and 20 percent be better than a flat tax of
20 percent?
<P>
 In fact, there are substantial benefits from a single rate system
in terms of fairness, stability, and simplicity, as the following
discussion makes clear.
<P>
<I><B>A single rate defines fairness:</B></I> At hearings across
the country the Commission heard one theme repeated over and over
again.  People do not want special privileges, but neither do
they want special penalties.  By an overwhelming margin, citizens
want taxpayers to be treated equally.  In the 14th Amendment,
states are prohibited from denying persons within their jurisdiction
&quot;equal protection of the laws.&quot; The same principle should
hold for the tax code.  If one taxpayers has ten times as much
taxable income as his neighbor, he should pay ten times as much
in taxes.  Not twenty times as much, which is what happens when
a discriminatory rate structure is imposed.  But neither should
the taxpayer with ten times the income get away with paying only
five times as much in taxes, which is what happens when the tax
code is vulnerable to clever machinations by lawyers, lobbyists,
and accountants.
<P>
<I><B>A single rate promotes efficiency and growth:  </B></I>Taxing
all potential producers of additional goods and services at the
same tax rate gives everyone an equal incentive to add to the
output of the economy.  The current graduated rate system imposes
higher tax rates the more one produces and discourages those who
are most efficient.  It particularly discourages people from taking
risks and making innovations and investments that could lead to
the greatest economic rewards not only for themselves but for
workers and consumers as well.
<P>
<I><B>A single rate is progressive:</B></I> All taxpayers should
be able to protect some level of income from taxation.  Whatever
this amount is called -- a zero-bracket amount, a family allowance,
or a personal exemption -- it represents an economic &quot;head-start&quot;
that permits taxpayers to satisfy the basic requirements of food,
clothing, and shelter before the tax collector demands a share.
 One result of this &quot;head-start&quot; is that it builds progressivity
into the single rate system.  Low income taxpayers would have
a bigger share of their income exempted from taxes, and would
enjoy a lower average tax rate, than higher income taxpayers.
 Above the exempt amount, a single rate tax would be proportional:
 a taxpayer with ten times the income of his neighbor would pay
ten times as much in taxes.
<P>
<I><B>A single rate will make it harder for future politicians
to undo tax reform:</B></I>  Witnesses expressed concern over
and over again that the Congress not repeat the mistakes of the
1986 Tax Reform Act.  That law, taxpayers complained, was supposed
to reform the tax code by eliminating deductions and giving taxpayers
lower rates, but by 1993 top tax rates had crept much of the way
back up to the pre-1986 levels.  One reason why the 1986 Act proved
so unstable was that it never achieved a single rate.  As a result,
taxpayers were subject to the old divide-and-conquer game.  Single
rate systems, by contrast, are much more stable.  In 1994, for
instance, Massachusetts voters were given an opportunity to replace
the state's flat tax with a so-called progressive system.  The
voters of the state rejected the proposal by a landslide margin
of 71 percent.  They knew that once the state had the opportunity
to tax one group at a higher rate, it would only be a matter of
time before all taxpayers wound up paying more.  The same political
dynamic will take place if there is a single rate tax at the federal
level.
<P>
<I><B>A single rate eliminates the marriage penalty:</B></I> Under
current law, the first dollar of income for a non-working spouse
who enters the labor market is taxed as if it were additional
income for the primary earner.  In a system of graduated rates,
this means that incomes that normally would be subject to marginal
tax rates of 15 percent are actually being taxed at rates of 28
percent or more.  This policy undermines work incentives, reduces
employment, and lowers tax revenues.  Needless to say, it is also
unfair to married couples.
<P>
<I><B>A single rate avoids tax timing problem:</B></I>  Many taxpayers,
including farmers and small business owners, have volatile incomes.
In a single rate system, they are not punished if their income
is sharply higher in one year than another.  In a system of discriminatory
graduated tax rates, however, they suffer if their income is received
unevenly.  Under graduated rates, people who can do so have an
incentive to engage in costly end-of-year exercises to ensure
that income is reported in the tax year where it will be subject
to lower rates.  Just the opposite occurs with deductions.  A
small business owner may delay or hasten the purchase of some
equipment depending on whether last year's, this year's, or next
year's income is subject to a lower tax rate.  All this complexity
disappears with a single rate system.
<P>
 Fairness, simplicity, and growth all require a new tax system
that taxes income only once and does so at a low, single rate.
 The most profound argument for one rate, however, is trust. 
Tax reform represents a compact with the American people, one
that taxpayers could be reluctant to embrace after what happened
in 1986 and beyond.  In order to ensure that a new tax system
will not be undermined and destroyed by future politicians, it
must be extremely hard to change.  This, more than any other reason,
is why one rate is so necessary.

<h2>TAXES ON THE POOR</h2>
By Bruce Bartlett<P>
</center>
<blockquote>
 Some of the highest implicit tax rates fall on poor individuals
as they try to work their way off welfare.  Not only do they have
to pay taxes on the income that they earn, but they also have
their welfare benefits reduced.  This reduction in benefits is
a de facto tax, because it reduces their net income the same way
direct taxes do.
<P>
 Depending on the precise combination of earnings, taxes and benefits,
a welfare mother can easily face marginal tax rates of over 100
percent.  That is, she pays in taxes and loses in benefits $1
or more for each additional dollar she might earn.  Obviously,
this is a severe disincentive to work and get off welfare.
<P>
 The table illustrates the problem, using, as an example, figures
for the state of Pennsylvania.  As one can see, a single mother
with two children would receive $7,548 in benefits if she had
zero earnings.  If she goes out and earns $2,000, the combination
of taxes and lower benefits raises her disposable income by just
$1,375.  This is equivalent to a tax rate of 31.25 percent on
the earnings.
<P>
 However, on the range of earnings between $5,000 and $8,000 per
year, the marginal tax rate rises to well over 80 percent.  In
other words, out of each additional dollar she earns, her disposable
income rises by less than 20 cents.  Thus a woman earning $8,000
per year is just $2,408 better off than the woman earning nothing.
 This is equivalent to an effective tax rate of 70 percent.
<P>
 Similar situations arise across the country, with only the degree
varying from state to state.
<P>
 De facto marginal tax rates are inherent in the nature of all
means-tested welfare programs.  The more quickly benefits are
phased-out, the higher the tax rate.  Reducing benefits gradually
reduces the tax rate, but necessarily raises the level of earnings
one can have and still receive benefits.
<P>
 The Congress is making a major effort to reform welfare to enable
states to try alternative systems, and this is commendable.  However,
the best answer to this problem is strong economic growth and
 a sharp increase in higher paying jobs.  Other steps, such as
deductibility of payroll taxes to ease that tax's burden on low
income workers, would be helpful as well.

<h2>WHY CAPITAL MATTERS</h2> 
By Stephen Moore</center><P>
<blockquote>
Capital is the engine of a growing economy. A recent study by
Dale Jorgenson, chairman of the Department of Economics at Harvard
University, showed that almost half of the growth of the American
economy between 1948 and 1980 was directly attributable to the
increase in U.S. capital formation (with most of the rest a result
of increases and improvements in the labor force).(1)
<P>
It is common to think of capital as money, such as dollars invested
in the stock market or in a business. To economists, capital refers
to investments in physical capital, such as buildings and machines,
as well as human capital -- investments in time and tuition in
acquiring valuable skills. Factories, office buildings, computers,
tractors and trucks are all capital investments that increase
the economy's ability to produce and distribute more and better
goods and services to consumers at the lowest possible cost.
<P>
The ultimate source of capital improvement is the human mind.
America's greatest economic asset is our people. Knowledge is
capital. Invention is capital. Technological improvement is capital.
The spirit of entrepreneurship is capital. The spark of an idea
that leads to a new business or a new way of doing things is capital.
Ten years ago when Bill Gates decided to form a computer softwear
company and then invented MS-DOS, he was creating capital. So
were the original investors who put money behind Microsoft. Thanks
to the vision of Bill Gates and the risk-taking of his investors,
Microsoft is now a globally dominant American firm employing 15,000
U.S. workers at high wages.
<P>
Between 1900 and 1990 real wages in the United States have risen
about six-fold. In other words, a worker today earns as much in
ten minutes as a worker in 1900 earned in an hour. What explains
this surge in the living standards of the American worker? Primarily
capital and productivity. U.S. workers are more productive, and
their real wages are higher than that of workers in most other
nations, because America has one of the highest ratios of capital
per worker in the world.
<P>
Farming is a clear example. Today, the American farmer is by far
the most productive in the world. Imagine what would happen to
the productivity and output of American farmers today if they
lacked modern irrigation systems, tractors, combines, and other
sophisticated farm machinery. They would be no more productive
than farmers in the poorest agrarian countries. Modern farm equipment
and techniques are forms of capital.
<P>
Punitive taxes on capital are often advocated out of a misplaced
belief that the returns from capital accrue primarily to the presumably
wealthy owners of capital, such as stockholders or owners of businesses.
To the extent that tax policy discourages capital accumulation,
however, productivity and real wages will stagnate or decline.
Nobel laureate Paul Samuelson explained the process as follows:
<P>
What happens to the wage rate when each person works with more
capital goods? Because each worker has more capital to work with,
his or her marginal product [or productivity] rises. Therefore,
the competitive real wage rises as workers become worth more to
capitalists and meet with spirited bidding up of their market
wage rates.(2)
<P>
Figure 1 confirms that capital formation is the key ingredient
to rising wages. Over the past fifty years, 90 percent of the
variation in real wages is explained by the ratio of capital to
labor. When there is more capital per worker, wages rise. Whenever
the ratio of capital worker stops rising, wages stagnate. When
capital taxes are running high and investment capital grows scarce,
the last areas that will receive funds from the shrinking investment
pool will be low-income, inner city neighborhoods.
<P>
Human capital is also critical to increasing productivity and
living standards. Sophisticated, high-tech equipment requires
skilled workers, and skilled workers need the best equipment.
Human capital includes education, training, and experience. If
workers are more skilled, they will produce more and thus command
higher salaries.
<P>
Under current law, those who save and invest in business capital
are subjected to numerous overlapping taxes on corporate earnings,
dividends, capital gains, and estates. Those who invest time and
money in improving their own human capital are subjected to the
highest marginal tax rates during their peak earning years. By
discouraging improvements in physical and human capital, such
tax policies slow the growth of the economy and of real wages.

<h2>ESTIMATES VS. REALITY</h2> 
By Alan Reynolds</center>
<P>
<blockquote>
Efforts to reform the tax system to promote efficiency and growth
and to raise the incomes of all Americans have continually been
thwarted by seriously deficient estimates of the revenue cost
to the federal government. Revenue estimates tend to be &quot;static&quot;
in the sense that they routinely ignore the effect of tax changes
on the level of total economic activity -- on the aggregate production,
employment, and income of the population. Consequently, they overstate
the revenue loss from tax rate reductions which can trigger substantial
economic growth, and overstate the revenue gains from tax rate
increases which can depress economic activity. Revenue estimators
also tend to understate the degree to which people can avoid taxes
by reducing the percent of their income taken in taxable form
or altering the timing of their income.
<P>
Before taking such estimates too seriously, it is prudent to keep
in mind the following warnings of Don Fullerton of the University
of Virginia:
<P>
First, each revenue estimate is only an estimate. It is an imperfect
best guess made by an arbitrarily assigned estimator who uses
old data, a set of arbitrary assumptions, and error-prone computer
calculations. A different estimator could easily make other reasonable
assumptions and get a different answer.
<P>
Second, these revenue estimates are always relative to existing
law, as if that were some valuable standard by which to judge
all changes. There is nothing absolute about current law, for
that is why changes are being considered in the first place.(1)
<P>
<B>Why We Need Dynamic, Not Static Revenue Estimates: Accounting
for Growth</B> 
<P>
A single low marginal tax rate in a system that was not biased
against saving and investment would substantially increase incentives
to work, save, and invest. Professor Dale Jorgenson, chairman
of the economics department at Harvard University, estimates that
such a system could ultimately boost the annual output of the
economy by about 15-20% on a permanent basis. Note that an increase
of that magnitude would bring in substantial additional revenue
to the federal government, enough to lower the tax rate by several
percentage points. Failure to take these revenues into account
would discourage tax reform and block the potential gains in income
and employment. Just as static revenue estimates invariably exaggerate
any revenue loss from lower tax rates, they likewise exaggerate
the revenue gains from higher tax rates.(2) Relying on the estimates
thus introduces a stubborn statistical bias in favor of higher
tax rates.
<P>
So many potentially important revenue-increasing effects of a
new tax system are completely ignored in the process of estimating
tax receipts that it makes little sense to demand that a new tax
system be &quot;revenue neutral&quot; in this static sense --
as defined by government bookkeepers. The current tax system is
suffocating the economy and encouraging tax avoidance and evasion.
A tax system conducive to more rapid economic growth and reduced
tax avoidance will generate far more revenue over time than the
current law.
<P>
Past experience with static revenue estimates should generate
some healthy skepticism. From 1981 to 1988, the highest tax rate
fell from 70% to 28%, and rates were generally reduced across
the board. Estimates prepared before the tax reduction suggested
that revenue growth would be impaired. Yet, measured in constant
1987 dollars, federal revenues were $916.2 billion in 1989, up
27% from $719.2 billion in 1979, the peak of the previous economic
expansion. In 1993, by contrast, real revenues were only $921.9
billion, barely changed from the 1989 level.(3)
<P>
Where tax rates were increased by the 1986 law, on the other hand,
revenues came in far below the estimates. In 1987 dollars, revenue
from the capital gains tax jumped from $28 billion in 1985 to
$54.3 billion in 1986. By 1990-93, however, real capital gains
tax receipts averaged only $24.6 billion per year.(4) Federal
revenues from the individual income tax <I>declined </I>from 8.6%
of GDP in 1989 to 8.2% in 1994, after two seemingly large increases
in individual tax rates in 1990 and 1993.
<P>
It is still commonly believed that lowering the highest tax rates
would lower revenues, with the result that middle incomes would
supposedly bear a larger share of the burden. Yet the experience
of the United States, Britain and other nations is the exact opposite:
Reducing unnecessarily high tax rates greatly <I>increases</I>
the amount collected at higher incomes, and thereby allows more
generous tax relief for those with middle or lower incomes.(5)
Again, estimates prepared prior to the 1981 tax cuts, which reduced
the highest tax rates from 70% to 28% suggested that less revenue
would be collected from those with higher incomes. By 1988, however,
the top 1% of taxpayers were actually paying 27.5% of all individual
income tax -- up from 17.6% in 1981.
<P>
Revenue estimators object to having their methods described as
&quot;static.&quot; They point out, correctly, that they do take
into account the fact that a higher excise tax will reduce sales
of the taxed product, or that a higher capital gains tax will
reduce the amount of gains that are realized each year -- but
always assuming an unchanged level of total employment and gross
domestic product (GDP). But this was never what the critics meant
by static revenue estimates. When economists outside the government
refer to &quot;dynamic&quot; revenue effects, they mean that lower
marginal tax rates and less hostile taxation of saving and investment
will increase total GDP. They will increase GDP by increasing
the percentage of adults who are willing to work, the intensity
and skill of work, the amount of personal and business saving,
the amount of investment (including investment in education),
risk-taking by entrepreneurs and investors, and the efficiency
with which labor and capital are used.
<P>
Congressional Budget Office economists William Randolph and Diane
Lim Rogers recently surveyed some recent evidence on the impact
of taxation, concluding that avoiding &quot;accounting for saving
and labor-supply behavior. . . cannot be justified based on existing
studies.&quot;(6) So why are such effects nonetheless routinely
ignored? The usual explanation is tradition and convention. &quot;Traditional
estimating conventions,&quot; explains a recent report from the
Joint Committee on Taxation, &quot;assume that tax law changes
will have no overall effect on economic aggregates such as gross
domestic product (GDP).&quot;
<P>
&quot;Following the standard revenue estimating conventions,&quot;
says a memo from the Office of Tax Analysis, &quot;the macroeconomic
aggregates, such as the level of compensation, prices, employment,
and gross domestic product, have been assumed to be unchanged
by the proposal.&quot;(7)
<P>
Estimates have always been done this way. It is indeed standard,
conventional and traditional. When it comes to estimating the
impact of an entirely new system, however, such an appeal to orthodoxy
is fatally flawed. Imagine using these estimating conventions
to estimate the impact of replacing income taxes with a national
sales tax. If prices were &quot;assumed to be unchanged by the
proposal,&quot; then how could businesses recoup the cost of a
new sales tax? If they did so by cutting wages, how could compensation
or employment be &quot;assumed to be unchanged&quot;? If pricesare assumed to not rise and wages assumed to not fall, then this
hypothetical sales tax must initially fall entirely on profits.
In that case, how could investment and GDP be &quot;assumed to
be unchanged&quot;? When it comes to estimating the impact of
entirely new tax systems, the conventional conventions are not
simply misleading but meaningless. They put aside all of the most
important questions by assuming them out of existence.
<P>
Revenue estimators sometimes excuse the fact that economic consequences
are ignored in the aggregate by the assertion that most benefits
will take more than five years to fully take effect, which is
beyond the usual budget planning period. Ignoring the long-run
benefits from a less hostile policy toward working and saving
is even more risky than pretending the effects do not exist. Myopic
revenue estimates may thwart sound policies that are most likely
to generate the most revenue in the long run, in favor of gimmicks
that might <I>appear</I> to raise estimated revenue in the short
run, while eventually losing revenue by damaging economic growth.
<P>
By increasing the incentive and ability to save, and to invest
time and money in education and training, a tax system that taxes
income only once, and does so at a single low rate, will greatly
enlarge and improve the economy's stock of capital and human capital.
That, in turn, will raise output per worker (productivity) and
thus increase real wages. None of these effects are ever considered
in revenue estimates or distribution tables. Tax burdens are distributed
based on <I>existing</I> incomes, for example, even though making
it easier to <I>increase</I> income and wealth is a major objective
of a new tax system.
<P>
It may not yet be technically feasible to estimate the <I>exact</I>
impact of tax policy<B> </B>on savings, employment, interest rates
and production. It is, however, possible to estimate the <I>direction</I>
and general magnitude of such effects through the use of models
that appropriately account for the manner in which tax changes
alter incentives to supply labor and capital. At a minimum, traditional,
static estimates should carry explicit warning labels about what
is left out of the calculations, and an informed judgment about
the direction and likely magnitude of the resulting errors.(8)
<P>
A savings-neutral tax with a single low rate will result in a
very significant, sustained increase in the amount of income that
is both earned and reported.(9) If &quot;traditional&quot; (static)
estimates conclude that this or that specific single tax rate
would be &quot;revenue neutral,&quot; experience teaches that
such a rate would most likely result in a very substantial <I>increase
</I>in real tax receipts over time.(10)
<P>
<B>Why We Need Dynamic, Not Static Revenue Estimates: Reporting
More Income and Reducing Tax Avoidance</B> 
<P>
The federal income tax on individuals has <I>always</I> hovered
around 9-10% of personal income ever since the Korean War -- regardless
of whether the top tax rate was 92% or 28%, and regardless of
whether so-called loopholes were opened or closed. From 1951 to
1994, receipts from the individual income tax have never been
lower than 9% of personal income, and briefly reached 11% in only
two recession years, 1969 and 1981.(11)
<P>
Since the federal tax on individual incomes has been almost constant
as a percentage of personal income, the revenue yield from this
tax mostly depends on (1) the proportion of personal income that
is reported and taxed, and (2) the growth of personal income.
High, graduated tax rates are damaging in both respects. High
tax rates encourage people to minimize the proportion of income
that is reported as taxable, and also to avoid doing any extra
working or saving that would cause personal (and national) income
to rise. In 1993, individual income taxes brought in only 9.2%
of personal income, down from 10.1% in 1988. Growth of real GDP
also slowed from 3.8% a year in 1983-89 to only 2.5% from the
second quarter of 1991 to the third quarter of 1995.(12)
<P>
Revenue estimates rarely take much notice, if any, of the well
documented fact that higher tax rates increase tax avoidance and
evasion, and lower tax rates reduce the incentive to maximize
deductions or to cheat. There are many ways in which people can
minimize the proportion of income that is reported as taxable.
These behavior changes need to be taken into account in the revenue
estimates.
<P>
Taxable income in 1992 was only 46.5% of all personal income,
down from 50.8% in 1988. The wider gap between personal income
and taxable income partly reflects more intense use of deductions,
including the expanded earned income tax credits. High tax rates
also increase the incentive to become more aggressive in seeking
legal and illegal ways to minimize the tax bite. And high tax
rates increase the attractiveness of tax-financed entitlements,
compared with taxable work and saving. Government transfer payments
(most of which are taxed lightly, if at all) rose from 14.3% of
personal income in 1989 to 16.9% in 1994. With a single, low tax
rate, people will have much less incentive to take their income
in ways that escape taxes (including transfer payments and the
underground economy), and much more incentive to earn more.
<P>
Revenue estimates rarely consider the fact that what happens to
one tax is likely to alter behavior and affect revenues from another
tax. Douglas Bernheim has shown that reduction of the tax rate
on estates can be expected to increase revenues from the individual
income tax, due to reduced incentives for aggressive estate planning.(13)
Since tax proposals are usually examined one at a time, &quot;general
equilibrium&quot; questions about the eventual impact on the entire
tax base are neglected. This can be a serious problem when evaluating
proposals to completely rebuild the tax system. Partly because
of widespread tax arbitrage, Roger Gordon and Joel Slemrod estimated
that &quot;abandoning entirely any attempt to tax capital income
. . . would have resulted in a slight <I>rise </I>in government
revenue.&quot;(14) Gordon and Slemrod found that the<I> apparent</I>
reduction in revenue from eliminating all capital taxes would
be more than offset by increased revenue from other taxes. Traditional
revenue estimates would not reveal such an effect, which creates
a systematic bias against reducing or eliminating inefficient
taxes.
<P>
Another source of estimating bias is the practical necessity of
ignoring effects that are difficult to measure. It is well known
that a capital-importing country like the U.S. can collect more
revenue from a territorial tax system than under the current residence-based
system.(15) However, there is no past experience to use in making
a reliable estimate of exactly how much more revenue a territorial
system may yield. Whenever there is no sound basis for making
an estimate, such complex effects are usually ignored. When switching
to an entirely new system, nearly every change is without precedent.
That means what is ignored is likely to be more important than
what is counted.
<P>
Even aside from the impact of a new tax system on capital formation
and work incentives (which estimators <I>always </I>ignore), there
are many potentially important ways in which various alternatives
to the current tax regime might be expected to increase tax revenues.
Because there is no precedent, however, these revenue-improving
effects are inherently difficult to quantify. They include: (1)
improving compliance by reducing complexities; (2) reducing the
incentive and opportunity to maximize deductions and other avoidance
devices; and (3) ending opportunities to avoid taxes by setting
up different types of business entities, or by shifting income
into low-tax years and deductible expenses into high-tax years.
Because even such &quot;microeconomic&quot; issues are hard to
quantify, they are unlikely to be considered in estimates of revenues.
<P>
Estimates of revenues and tax burdens employ models <I>based on
past experience</I> to predict or &quot;simulate&quot; what would
happen under an entirely different tax structure and tax rate.
When it comes to major changes in the tax structure and rates,
very little can be estimated on the basis of past experience.
Nobel Laureate Robert Lucas demonstrated that such statistical
exercises are inherently flawed, because human behavior under
one system will be quite different under another. &quot;Simulations
using these models can, in principle, provide<I> no </I>useful
information as to the actual consequences of alternative economic
policies,&quot; wrote Professor Lucas, &quot;[These] kinds of
policy simulations . . . are meaningless.&quot;(16)

<h2>TAX BIASES AGAINST SAVING AND INVESTMENT AND HOW TO FIX THEM</h2> 
By Stephen Entin</center>
<blockquote><P>
<B>Tax biases on income that is saved: four layers of tax.</B>

<P>
The income tax hits income that is saved and invested much harder
than income used for consumption. The income tax is imposed on
income that is saved and again on the income produced by the saving.
In contrast, the income tax falls on income used for consumption
but does not fall again on the consumption spending and the services
and enjoyment it provides.
<P>
For example, if one uses after-tax income to buy a bond, the stream
of interest payments is also taxed. If one uses after-tax income
to buy a television, there is no additional tax on the purchase
of the TV or the stream of entertainment it provides.
<P>
In fact, people who save and invest find their income subject
to four layers of federal tax (versus one layer for consumption).
<P>
<I>Layer 1 -- tax on earnings.</I> The income is taxed when first
earned.
<P>
<I>Layer 2 -- tax on interest and business income.</I> When the
after-tax income is saved, the returns on the saving are taxed
-- double taxation. If the saver puts his or her income into a
bond or bank account, the interest earned is taxed. If the saver
invests directly in a small business, his or her investment income
from the proprietorship or partnership is taxed. If the saver
buys a share of corporate stock, he or she is in fact buying a
share of the company, a claim to a share of its income, and his
or her share of the corporate income tax on the corporate earnings.
<P>
<I>Layer 3 --taxes on dividends and capital gains.</I> Shareholders
face triple taxation. In addition to the original tax on the saving
and the tax paid by the corporation, shareholders must pay personal
income tax on any dividends that the corporation distributes out
of its after-tax income. (This is sometimes called &quot;the double
taxation of dividends&quot;, but it is really the third layer
of tax because the income used to buy the shares was taxed before
it was saved.)
<P>
There is a third layer of income tax even if the corporation does
not pay a dividend. If a corporation (or other business) retains
its after-tax earnings for reinvestment, the earning power and
the value of the business will increase. If the owner or shareholder
sells the business or the shares, the increase in value is taxed
as a capital gain.
<P>
Capital gains can arise whenever a business's prospects improve,
not just because of reinvestment of previously-taxed earnings.
The development of a successful new product, or a discovery such
as a new wonder drug or a new oil field, can the boost the after-tax
earnings outlook of a business and increase its current market
value. If the higher expected business earnings come to pass,
they will be taxed as corporate income and/or unincorporated business
or personal income. To tax as well the increase in the business's
current value if the business or the shares are sold is to double-tax
the future income of the business before it even occurs, and to
triple-tax the initial saving.(1) The current law income tax treatment
of capital gains, whatever their source, is multiple taxation
of saving.(2)
<P>
<I>Layer 4 -- estate and gift taxes.</I> If the saving outlives
the saver, and the remaining unspent assets exceed a modest exempt
amount, the federal unified transfer (estate and gift) tax imposes
another layer of federal tax on the already multiply-taxed saving.
<P>
<B>Ending the tax biases against saving and investment</B> 
<P>
These tax biases are real and they have serious consequences.
Savers and investors expect a reasonable after-tax return on their
assets. Because of these biases, saving and investment must earn
substantially higher returns to cover the added taxes and still
be worthwhile substitutes for consumption. Saving and investment
earn higher returns only if the quantity of capital is significantly
reduced, making the value of each additional unit's output that
much greater. The current biases in the tax treatment of capital
have cost the economy several trillion dollars in saving and investment,
considerably retarding the growth of productivity, wages, and
employment, and retarding the growth of individual income and
wealth. It is no exaggeration to suggest that the level of income
in the United States could be at least 15% to 20% higher than
it is today if these biases did not exist. That missing income
has simply been thrown away to no good purpose. These losses could
amount to as much as $4,000 to $6,000 per year for typical middle
income families. The current system also cripples people's ability
and incentive to save for retirement, leaving people with less
retirement income than they need to be financially secure, and
increasing their dependence on government programs or their children
in old age.
<P>
Making the tax system even-handed or neutral between saving and
investment, on the one hand, and consumption on the other, requires
several steps.
<P>
<I>The transfer tax on estates and gifts must be eliminated.</I>
Most of an estate is saving that has already been taxed. There
is no justice in taxing it again. Those elements of an estate
that consisted of tax deferred saving should remain tax deferred
so long as the heirs continue to save it. The current harsh treatment
of estates makes elderly people fearful of holding onto their
assets. Forcing them to divest their assets does them no service.
The modest exempt amount in current law, $600,000, is a sum of
money that would be wiped out in a decade if an elderly couple
required nursing home care.
<P>
<I>The dual taxation of corporate income at the corporate and
individual level must be eliminated through &quot;integration&quot;
of the individual and corporate income taxes (or the substitution
of a non-income type of tax system).</I> Integration means that
corporate income is recognized as belonging to the shareholders,
and is taxed either on individual tax returns or corporate tax
returns, but not both.
<P>
<I>The tax system must either allow savers to deduct saving or
to exclude the returns on saving from taxable income. There must
be no separate, additional taxation of capital gains. Investment
outlays must be deducted in the year the outlay is made (expensed)
rather than depreciated over time.</I> Deducting saving and taxing
the returns, as is done to a limited degree with pensions and
IRAs, is one way to eliminate the basic tax bias against saving.
Another method is to treat saving as we now treat tax exempt bonds;
there is no deduction of the amount saved, but no taxation of
the interest or other returns. The following section presents
some simple examples to illustrate how a tax bias arises if these
rules are broken, and why these treatments are the correct ones.
<P>
<U><I><B>Neutral treatment of income used for saving and consumption</B></I></U>

<P>
The income tax, by taxing both income that is saved and the returns
on that income, taxes saving and investment more heavily than
consumption. There are two ways to restore neutrality. One approach
is to exclude saving from taxable income while taxing all returns
on the saving. The other is to include saving in taxable income
but impose no tax on the returns.
<P>
<I>Deduct saving, tax returns method.</I> Excluding (or deducting)
saving and investment from taxable income is called &quot;expensing&quot;.
In the case of saving, expensing is akin to the tax-deferred treatment
allowed limited amounts of retirement saving today (as with current
IRAs, 401(k) plans, 403 (b) plans, SEPs, and Keogh plans), but
with no restrictions on the amount of saving that could be deducted,
no penalty tax on withdrawal at any age, and no forced distribution
at any age. In effect, the purchase of a bond, bank account, or
share of stock would be recognized as a cost of earning income.
When the outlay is made, it would be deducted. When the returns
come in, they would be taxed (including interest, dividends, the
return of the principal when the bond matures, or the proceeds
from the sale of the stock at a later date).
<P>
<I>Tax saving, exempt returns method.</I> The other route to neutrality
is to tax the income that is to be saved, but exempt interest,
dividends, capital gains, and other returns on the saving from
tax. This is akin to the tax treatment accorded state and local
tax exempt bonds. No deduction for buying the asset is allowed,
but the returns are not taxed.
<P>
Both methods of dealing with saving eliminate the excess tax on
income that is saved compared to income that is used for consumption.
A tax increases the cost of whatever item or activity it is imposed
upon. The income tax is biased because it raises the cost of saving
and investment more than it raises the cost of consumption. Let's
look at how much more a person must earn to support a given level
of consumption after a tax is imposed, compared to how much more
must be earned to buy an asset that delivers a given amount of
after-tax income.
<P>
Suppose that, if there were no income tax, one could buy $100
of consumption goods or a $100 bond paying 4% interest, or $4
a year. Now impose a 20% income tax. One would have to earn $125,
and give up $25 in tax, to have $100 of after-tax income to consume.
The pre-tax cost of $100 of consumption has risen 25%. To get
a $4 interest stream, after taxes, one would have to earn $5 in
interest, pre-tax. But $5 in interest requires a $125 bond. To
buy a $125 bond, one would have to earn $156.25 and pay $31.25
in tax. The cost of the after-tax interest stream has gone up
56.25%, more than twice the increase in the cost of consumption.
(See table.) Put another way, if there were no income tax, obtaining
a $1 stream of interest would cost the saver $25 in current consumption
($100/$4). After the income tax, it would take $156.25 to buy
a $4 interest stream or $125 of consumption. Each $1 interest
stream would cost $31.25 in foregone consumption ($125/$4), 25%
more than in the no-tax situation.
<P>
There are two ways to restore neutradity. One is to exempt interest
from tax, as with state and local tax exempt bonds. One would
then have to earn $125 to buy a $100 bond, earning $4 with no
further tax. The other method is to allow a deduction for income
that is saved, while taxing the returns, as with a deductible
IRA. One would have to earn $125 to buy a $125 bond, earning $5
in interest pre-tax, and, after paying $1 in tax on the interest,
have $4 left.(3)

<B>Income Tax Bias Against Saving and Two Cures</B><br>
<img src="rpt5.gif" alt="Chart"></center>
<P>
<B>Neutral treatment of investment: expensing</B>
<P>
Expensing is the simplest and most sensible way to provide unbiased
tax treatment of direct investment in physical capital. Just as
neutral treatment of saving can be accomplished by deducting saving
and taxing the returns, neutral treatment of investment can be
achieved by expensing investment and taxing the returns. Expensing
means writing off the investment in the year it is purchased rather
than the current practice of stretching out capital consumption
(depreciation) allowances over an extended period of time, which
reduces their value. The stretch-out constitutes an interest-free
loan to the Treasury of the taxes that would otherwise have been
saved by the deduction. Outlays for plant, equipment, buildings
and other structures, land, inventory, and research and development
should all be deductible in the year the outlays are made, just
as for any other production input. Subsequently, all the returns
on these investments, including sales of goods and services, rents,
and royalties (all net of other costs), and sales of assets, should
be taxed.
<P>
Under current law, purchases of equipment are written off over
perigds of time ranging from 3 to 20 years. Most structures are
written off over a 39 year period. Stretching out the write-off
period reduces the present value of the deductions due to lost
interest and inflation. The result is that the business deducts
an amount that is less in present value than the value of the
equipment. The under-depreciation overstates taxable income, resulting
in a higher-than-statutory tax rate on the real earnings of the
asset. The table illustrates the difference in the value of the
deductions between expensing and one of the set of depreciation
schedules commonly used in current law. For example, the present
value of deductions for the 7 year asset at 3% inflation and a
3.5% real discount rate is only 84.6% of the cost of the asset.
The present value falls short of expensing by $15.40 on a $100
piece of equipment, costing the firm an extra $5.39 in tax in
present value terms, assuming a 35% corporate tax rate. The longer
the life of the asset, the greater is the loss of value of the
write-off.(4)<HR>

<P>
Depreciation schedules under the alternative minimum tax (AMT)
are even less favorable than those allowed under the regular income
tax. The AMT is designed to make businesses and individuals pay
some tax each year even if legitimate business deductions reduce
their ordinary taxable income to zero. It must be understood that,
in reality, revenues are not income until they exceed the cost
of producing the income. By holding deductible costs below actual
costs, ordinary depreciation and AMT depreciation schedules overstate
businesses' and individuals' real incomes. When income is overstated
for tax purposes, the tax is a bigger percent of the taxpayer's
true income than the statutory tax rate. The overstatement of
income sometimes turns a real loss into an apparent profit and
forces a tax payment when none should be due.
<P>
A tax system that does not allow full and immediate write offs
for capital costs is biased against investment relative to consumption
and against investment in long lived assets relative to short
lived assets. The current tax treatment of depreciation diverts
economic activity in the United States away from capital intensive
industries such as manufacturing, especially heavy industry, and
into services and less capital intensive production. In the process,
many high value added jobs have been lost.
<P>
Accountants and tax officials often argue for delaying write-offs
to correspond with the gradual decline in an asset's future earning
power as the asset wears out. This so-called &quot;economic depreciation&quot;
is fine for measuring the size of the country's capital stock
and the level of economic capacity, but it has nothing to do with
appropriately measuring the taxable income of an individual or
business, which is revenues less costs. When a business (or its
lenders and shareholders) buys a machine or other asset, it gives
up the resources to pay for it at the moment the payment is made,
not several years later. It must immediately forego all other
possible uses of the money, including earning interest, hiring
labor, buying inventory, or distributing dividends to shareholders
to save or consume as they see fit. Furthermore, the seller of
the machine must take the sales revenue into taxable income immediately.
The asymmetrical treatment by the Treasury of the buyer and the
seller -- partial write-off for the buyer, full taxation of the
purchase price for the seller -- is clearly arbitrary, inappropriate,
and anti-investment. Only expensing measures income correctly,
and imposes the correct amount of tax.

<B>Notes</B> 
<P>
1. It must be made clear that a capital gain on a bond, stock,
or sale of an unincorporated business or other property is not
an additional amount of income above and beyond the interest or
business income underlying the assets. The current price of an
asset is the value that people put on the future income the asset
will generate after taxes. Asset prices change if the expected
future after-tax earnings change. If a stock's future annual earnings
are expected to be $5 a share before taxes, and (assuming a 20%
tax rate) $4 a share after taxes, and if the &quot;discount rate&quot;
(the rate of return that people demand to receive to compensate
them for the use of their resources and inflation) is 10%, then
the share price will be $40 (because $40 at 10% yields $4 a year).
The $40 stock price is the &quot;present value&quot; of an indefinite
stream of $4 in after-tax future earnings. If the business announces
a new product and its projected income doubles to $10 a share
before tax and $8 after-tax, the share price will about double
to $80. If the earnings projections come true, the additional
$5 in annual income will be taxed, yielding the Treasury an additional
$1 a year. The additional $4 in after-tax future earnings are
worth $40 at the present time. If that $40 jump in the share price
is taxed as a capital gain (an $8 tax at a 20% rate), it constitutes
an extra layer of tax on the additional after-tax future income,
equivalent to raising the tax rate on the $5 pre-tax income stream
from 20% to 36%. (The $8 capital gains tax is equivalent to $.80
a year, on top of the $1 income tax on the earnings. $1.80/$5
= 36%.)
<P>
2. Additional equally unjustified extra layers of tax can sneak
in when corporations hold stock in other companies. If the Company
A holds less than 80% of the stock of Company B, then Company
A must pay tax on 30% of dividends it receives from Company B
before passing the dividends on to its own shareholders for additional
taxation. Any capital gains tax paid by a corporation is also
an unjustified additional layer of tax on saving.
<P>

saving and investment, see: Bradford, David F., et al, <U>Blueprints

4. In theory, the present value of deferred write-offs could be
made equal to expensing by paying appropriate interest on the
write-offs, as in the various &quot;neutral cost recovery systems&quot;
that have been proposed in recent years. Alternatively, a schedule
of investment tax credits could be designed, one for each asset
life, to offset the bias. The former approach is complicated and
the interest rate might not match the discount rate (adjusted
for risk and opportunity cost) of the investor. The latter approach
would require adjusting the ITC every time the inflation rate
changed. Expensing is simple, unbiased, and foolproof.

<h2>GROWTH-FRIENDLY TAX SYSTEMS</h2> 
By Stephen Entin
</center>
<P>
<blockquote>
There are several types of tax systems that successfully exclude
saving and investment or their returns from tax, eliminate the
bias against saving and investment, and simplify the tax system.
These include two types of unbiased income taxes and various types
of sales taxes. Each has advantages and disadvantages, but they
all have one very important point in common: they are all unbiased
taxes on labor and capital income, properly measured, either when
earned or when spent. Whatever direction the tax restructuring
movement takes, it is important to remember that all these approaches
have this great common advantage over current law. All of the
serious tax reform proposals that are being widely discussed around
the country and in Washington employ one or more of these approaches
in some form.
<P>
<I>Saving-deferred income tax.</I> Under the saving-deferred income
tax, all labor and capital income would be taxed once and only
once on individual tax returns. There would be personal exemptions
and a tax rate structure that could be flat or graduated. (The
Commission favors a single rate.)(1) The distinctive feature of
this system is that individuals would exclude their saving from
taxable income; they would include the returns on their saving
-- interest, dividends, and sales of assets -- in taxable income,
but only if the returns were withdrawn for consumption, and not
reinvested. Businesses would deduct their dividend payments as
well as their interest payments, passing them on to shareholders
and lenders for tax purposes. Any remaining capital earnings retained
by the business for reinvestment would be tax deferred on behalf
of the shareholders, and investment would be expensed. Since all
taxable capital income would be reported on individual tax returns,
businesses would not need to file. Further details are presented
below.
<P>
<I>Returns-exempt income tax. </I>The best known example of a
returns-exempt income tax is the single-rate tax proposed by professors
Robert Hall and Alvin Rabushka.(2) In its pure form it would have
only one tax rate applicable to income over a large exempt amount,
with no other deductions permitted. Only labor and pension income
would be taxed on individual tax returns. In general, individuals
would not deduct their saving, but would not be taxed on the earnings
of the saving. (In legislative variations of this proposal, contributions
to pensions and other retirement plans would remain deductible,
and the withdrawals taxable, as under current law.) All income
from capital would be taxed once and only once on business tax
returns. Business would expense investment outlays and other costs,
and pay tax on all the returns. Some possible variations of the
tax, allowing some deductions, are presented below.
<P>
<I>Sales tax.</I> Taxes imposed on the sales of goods and services,
such as a retail sales tax or a manufacturers excise tax, allow
individuals to defer tax on their saving until the saving is withdrawn
for consumption. A national retail sales tax, if it were to exclude
investment goods from the sales tax base, would be neutral as
between income used for saving and investment and income used
for consumption.(3)
<P>
<B>The nature of the taxes</B> 
<P>
One point of clarification is in order. Various types of sales
taxes and excise taxes are often referred to as &quot;consumption
taxes&quot;, rather than income taxes, because they are collected
when products are produced or sold. A broadly-imposed national
retail sales tax would fall on an amount of GNP that equals total
consumption. Nonetheless, these are not taxes on the act of consumption
or on the goods and services consumed. Goods and services do not
pay taxes. Only people pay taxes. All taxes, in fact, are taxes
on income. Sales and excise taxes either depress sales of the
taxed products, reducing the incomes of the people who provide
the labor and capital used to make them, or they reduce the purchasing
power of that income when the workers and savers attempt to spend
it.
<P>
The two neutral income-style taxes are imposed on income as it
is earned, with the amount saved and invested excluded (or the
earnings of saving excluded). Saving and investment are outlays
that people make to earn income. There is no real income or profit
from saving and investment until the returns exceed the outlays.
Consequently, taxing that part of the payments to labor and capital
left over after saving and investment is the correct amount of
income from labor and capital to tax. (Alternatively, the saving
should be taxed, and the returns exempted.) These systems are
sometimes called &quot;consumption-based income taxes&quot; or
&quot;saving-deferred income taxes&quot;. Excluding from total
income the amount that is saved and used to finance investment
leaves an amount equal in a given time period to total consumption.
This does not convert the tax into a consumption tax, however;
it is merely a means of avoiding multiple taxation of income used
for saving, and the returns on the saving will be taxed when earned,
unless reinvested in turn. It bears repeating that all taxes are
paid out of income by people, not by businesses, and not by goods
and services.
<P>
<B>Benefits in common -- ending tax biases and promoting simplicity</B>

<P>
Each of these tax systems eliminates the tax bias against saving
and investment found in the current income tax. Each can readily
accommodate a single low tax rate on all taxpayers. Each can substantially
reduce the confusing treatment of foreign source income that cripples
American firms attempting to compete abroad. Each system would
eliminate the alternative minimum tax and the estate tax. The
systems would have expensing instead of depreciation (or equivalent
non-taxation of investment outlays), and no separate taxation
of capital gains. Many of the major sources of complexity in the
current tax code would be gone.
<P>
<B>Some differences to consider</B> 
<P>
While sharing many advantages, some of these tax systems do better
than others when measured against the other important tax policy
considerations. Among these are simplicity, visibility, and fairness.
The integrated saving-deferred income tax and, to a large extent,
the returns-exempt income tax, show the cost of government pretty
clearly, and can easily exempt low-income citizens. Sales taxes
tend to be hidden in the cost of goods and services, making the
cost of government less visible.(4) They are the easiest taxes
for individuals to comply with -- individuals are totally divorced
from the collection process -- but they may go too far in that
regard. Sales taxes also pose some problems with respect to easing
their burden on low income taxpayers and compliance costs of businesses.
Some additional work on these issues is needed. Sales taxes may
be imposed on imports and remitted or not levied on exports. This
feature is called border adjustability, or being &quot;destination-based&quot;.
These taxes may also be set up without border adjustability, in
which case they are called &quot;origin-based&quot;. The question
of border adjustment should not be the determining consideration
in choosing which tax system to adopt.(5)
<P>
<B>A closer look at the saving-deferred tax and returns-exempt
tax</B> 
<P>
Both types of unbiased income tax can be constructed with an exempt
amount for people with low income and a single rate for incomes
above the exempt amount. The single rate would eliminate the graduated
tax rate bias against work, education, risk taking, and success.
Neither would discriminate or double tax income used for saving
and investment. Both would be significantly simpler, over all,
than current law.
<P>
In both systems, all income would be taxed, but only once. The
income from investment -- which belongs to the savers (lenders,
shareholders, and owners of non-corporate business) who financed
the investment -- would be taxed either on the savers' tax returns
after it is distributed by the businesses, or on the businesses'
tax returns before it is distributed to the savers, but not both.
Whichever approach is taken, it would be incorrect to conclude
that capital income was escaping tax because it did not appear
on one tax form or the other. The only reason that income from
capital appears on both types of tax form under current law is
that current law double and triple taxes income that is saved.
<P>
<I>Saving-deferred tax.</I> The theory behind the saving-deferred
tax (also known as a cash flow tax or inflow-outflow tax) is that
all income should be taxed as close to the final recipient of
the income as possible, for maximum visibility. In its pure form,
all inflows (all receipts) would be taxable, and all outflows
(all outlays associated with earning the income, or any income
given away to others, either voluntarily or as a tax) would be
deductible.
<P>
Individuals would pay tax on labor income (wages, salaries, and
the value of fringe benefits), the taxable portion of social security,
and capital income (interest, dividends, pension income). Individuals
would deduct their net saving (including purchases of stocks and
bonds) or pay tax on their net withdrawals (including sales of
assets).(6) There would be no separate calculation of capital
gains; they would be covered in the proceeds from the sale of
assets. Employers and financial institutions would report all
these net amounts to the taxpayers on forms like those currently
in use. Since all saving could be deducted in this system, all
current-law restrictions on the amounts allowed as contributions
and withdrawals under employer-sponsored pension plans should
be eliminated.
<P>
Individuals would deduct personal allowances. In the pure form
of this tax, deductions would include mortgage and other interest
paid, charitable contributions, and, if allowed, the individual
portion of payroll taxes and state and local taxes.(7) These deductions
would be over and above the personal allowances.
<P>
There would be no separate taxation of businesses in a saving-deferred
tax. Interest and dividends would be deductible by businesses
in this tax system, passed on to lenders and shareholders to be
taxed. The remaining earnings retained by the business for reinvestment
would be treated as tax deferred saving by the shareholders or
other owners. These deductions would exhaust the earnings.(8)
<P>
In this system, the deduction for business investment would effectively
be passed along to the savers who lend money to, buy shares in,
or otherwise invest in the business. Savers would deduct their
purchases of stocks and bonds. These proceeds of stock and bond
issues, plus retained earnings, would be treated as taxable inflows
to a business, but these sources of financing must just equal
the (deductible) capital investment and net saving of the business,
eliminating taxable business income. Consequently, there would
be no need for businesses to file an income tax return, eliminating
most of the accounting, auditing, and costs of enforcement and
compliance in the current tax system.
<P>
In a sense, businesses would be treated like pensions or IRAs
owned by the savers: all income individuals transfer to businesses
through lending or the purchase of shares would be deductible
by the savers; only those business earnings distributed to lenders
and shareholders (and not reinvested) would be taxable, and would
be reported on the individual tax returns.
<P>
<I>Returns-exempt or modified Hall-Rabushka tax.</I> The returns-exempt
income tax would impose a single tax rate above a generous exempt
amount. This system achieves simplification and unbiased treatment
of saving by taxing only labor and pension income on individual
tax returns and taxing all other income from capital on business
returns. There would be no need for businesses, individuals, or
the IRS to track the payments of capital income from businesses
to taxpayers. This method of achieving simplicity reduces the
visibility of the tax on capital.
<P>
In one relatively pure form of the returns-exempt income tax,
individuals who work would pay tax on wages, salaries, and the
value of non-pension fringe benefits. Retirees would pay tax only
on pension income (the only saving-related income taxed on individual
returns). Social security benefits would not be taxable. There
would generally be no deduction for non-pension saving, and no
tax on the returns on the individual tax form. For simplicity,
and to keep the tax rate low, the only deductions for individuals
would be for a generous personal allowance and, possibly, liberalized
pension plan contributions.(9) Since all saving is to receive
neutral treatment in this system, it would make sense to eliminate
all current-law restrictions on the amounts allowed as contributions
and withdrawals under employer-sponsored pension plans.
<P>
In that same form of the tax, businesses would pay taxes on returns
to capital before they are distributed to lenders, shareholders,
or other owners (except for pension distributions taxed on individual
returns). Businesses would not deduct interest or dividend payments,
and would not pay tax on interest and dividends received. Deductions
for fringe benefits and state and local taxes would be eliminated.
Payroll taxes would not be deductible. However, businesses could
expense all outlays on research and development and investment
in plant, equipment, structures, inventory, and land. Net operating
losses would be carried forward with interest.
<P>
Loss of the interest deduction for mortgagees and businesses would
be offset by elimination of the tax on interest received by lenders.
Interest rates would be expected to fall to current after-tax
levels, compensating borrowers for the loss of the deduction,
and leaving lenders with the same after-tax return as under current
law.
<P>
It is difficult to deal with banks, S&amp;Ls, brokerage houses,
and other financial intermediaries in any tax system in which
interest is not generally deductible by borrowers and taxable
to lenders, including the returns-exempt tax, sales taxes, or
value added taxes. A separate tax, based on inflow-outflow, would
have to be used for these businesses.(10)
<P>
Variations on this system are possible. In its pure form, the
Hall-Rabushka tax would have no itemized deductions for individuals.
One variation would allow the retention of the charitable deduction
and retention of the home mortgage interest deduction for borrowers.(11)
(Retention of the mortgage interest deduction for borrowers has
a limited revenue effect if the lenders are taxed on the interest
as under current law.) Congress should consider how best to treat
state and local income and property taxes. (See note 7, and background
paper, below, for a more complete discussion of various itemized
deductions for individuals and businesses under both tax systems.)
<P>
In its pure form, Hall-Rabushka would collect a greater amount
of tax from business than current law. To avoid the need for changes
in labor compensation agreements, retention of the payroll tax
deduction for businesses could be considered. To diminish the
adverse effect of the payroll tax on employment, the deduction
could be extended to individuals as well, in exchange for continued
but less onerous taxation of social security benefits. (The extension
is feasible under either income tax system. See background paper,
below, on the income tax treatment of payroll taxes and social
security benefits.)
<P>
<B>Comparison of saving-deferred tax and returns-exempt tax</B>

<P>
<I>Advantages and disadvantages of the saving-deferred tax.</I>
Of the two systems, the saving-deferred or inflow-outflow tax
would make taxes somewhat more visible to taxpayers, because interest,
dividends, and other returns on capital would be displayed on
individual income tax forms. It would be somewhat more complex
for individuals, but far less complex for businesses, than the
other approach. Businesses would pass through all taxable income
to individuals. Only distributions by businesses would be taxable;
businesses would have far fewer accounting and compliance costs,
and would not have to file federal tax returns. The deduction
for investment in plant and equipment would be effectively shifted
from businesses to the savers who provide the financing. This
would be an advantage for start-up businesses that have little
income as yet from previous investments against which to take
a deduction. The inflow-outflow tax could handle financial businesses
as easily as non-financial businesses.
<P>
<I>Advantages and disadvantages of the returns-exempt tax.</I>
The returns-exempt single rate tax would be simpler for individuals,
but more complex for business, than the other approach. There
would be fewer deductions to account for than under current law,
and individuals would not have to report capital income -- a simplification.
Businesses would still have to file tax returns in this system;
capital income would be reported on business tax returns, and
the tax would be less visible to the ultimate owners. To make
the tax on capital income visible to savers, businesses could
be required to report the income and the tax to lenders and shareholders,
for information only; the lenders and shareholders would not have
to include it on their tax returns. The financial sector of the
economy would have to be given the alternative inflow-outflow
type of tax treatment.
<P>
<B>Key points in common for the saving-deferred and returns-exempt
taxes</B> 
<P>
<I>Equivalence and importance of the approaches' treatment of
saving.</I> The two methods are equivalent in their treatment
of saving (if savers face the same tax rate over time), and better
than current law. For example, suppose that interest rates are
7 percent. At that rate of interest, $1 saved would grow, with
interest, to $2 in ten years. (Alternatively, suppose that reinvested
earnings caused the price of a share of stock to double in ten
years, and that the stock is sold and the capital gain is realized
at that time.) Suppose also that the income tax rate is 20%.
<P>
Under the saving-deductible method, an individual could earn $100,
save it without paying tax up front on the deposit or on the annual
interest build-up (or on the stock purchase and accruing gain),
and withdraw $200 ten years later. After paying a 20% tax on the
withdrawal (or the proceeds of the stock sale), the saver would
have $160 to spend.
<P>
Under the exempt-returns method, an individual could earn $100,
pay a 20% tax, and save the remaining $80. Without owing any further
tax on the returns, he could withdraw $160 ten years later, and,
here too, would have $160 to spend.
<P>
Either neutral method is better than current law. Under the current
tax system, an individual earning $100 would have to pay a 20%
tax, save $80, and owe tax annually on the interest, reducing
the 7% percent interest rate to an after-tax rate of 5.6%. With
less interest left to build up after taxes, the saver would accumulate
only $138 to withdraw and spend after ten years. The $22 difference
($160-$138) between current law and the neutral systems (about
14% over 10 years) is a measure of the double taxation imposed
by current law on income that is saved.
<P>
The penalty on saving under current law sharply retards the build
up of retirement saving that is not protected from double taxation
by a pension plan. (See graph.) A dollar saved at 7% interest,
tax-deferred, at age 25 would compound to $16 at age 65, and to
$32 at age 75, before tax. After a 20% tax on withdrawals, the
saver would have $12.80 or $25.60 to spend. In an ordinary double-taxed
bank account at 7%, however, the spendable amount at age 65 would
be only $8.83, or only $15.23 at age 70, about 30% and 40% less,
respectively.
<P><img src="rpt4.gif" alt="Graph" align="right">
The enhanced ability to save for education, home ownership, and
retirement would be an important feature of a restructured tax
code. Retirement saving is a subject of great importance as the
baby boom approaches old age. The Social Security System faces
enormous deficits. Eliminating those deficits by means of large
increases in the payroll tax would cost several million jobs.
The Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform has discussed
increased reliance on private retirement saving as an alternative
solution.(12)
<P>
<I>Treatment of capital gains.</I> As the example above shows,
the two methods produce the same after-tax returns on saving involving
capital gains. In fact, under either the saving-deferred or returns-exempt
approach to ending the tax bias, capital gains would cease to
be a tax issue, greatly simplifying tax forms for individual and
business taxpayers and reducing disputes with the IRS. Under the
return-exempt approach, there would obviously be no tax on capital
gains, because no returns on saving would be taxable. In the deductible-saving
case, the purchase of the assets would be expensed (resulting
in no basis for tax purposes), and all the proceeds of asset sales
would be properly included in taxable income. Any gain or loss
embedded in the numbers would be automatically calculated correctly
for tax purposes, without any special calculations required. If
the proceeds of asset sales were reinvested, any embedded gains
could be rolled over, and would remain tax deferred until withdrawn
for consumption.
<P>
<I>Growth and job creation.</I> Either of these income tax systems,
or the national sales tax, would be far more conducive to growth
than current law. They would allow the economy to gain, over about
a decade, the investment and growth that the current biased tax
system has suppressed. They take different approaches to eliminating
the biases in current law. They have different transition problems,
but none of these are unsolvable. The sooner that one of these
approaches is adopted, the sooner the gains can be realized.
<P>
The potential for faster growth of jobs and incomes should allay
concerns that tax reform might force a choice between higher short
term budget deficits and tax increases for some taxpayers. In
particular, when we look at how tax reform affects a family or
individual worker or taxpayer, it is not enough to apply the new
tax code to last year's income because neither the economy nor
the taxpayer will behave the same way after tax reform as before.
As saving and investment increase, productivity and the taxpayer's
income will grow faster for a decade or more and be higher by
increasing amounts over time. The taxpayer will enjoy lower interest
rates on mortgages and student loans as the tax burden on saving
is reduced. Although reduced taxes on saving may not instantly
lower the tax of a twenty-year-old who has not yet begun to save,
it will lower taxes on that worker as he or she accumulates assets
over a working lifetime, and leave that worker many tens of thousands,
or even hundreds of thousands, of dollars better off by age 65,
and far more secure in retirement (see graph). Whatever happens
in the first year, people will enjoy a lifetime of benefits from
a pro-grow tax reform, and it is the lifetime benefit that should
be looked at.
<P>
As for the federal budget, there are many benefits, both short
term and long term. People would immediately have less incentive
to shelter their existing income from tax. Even before total income
rises, Treasury would see some revenue offset to any net tax reduction.
Furthermore, national income would begin to grow faster right
from the start. An extra point on the growth rate would add a
cumulative extra half trillion dollars to federal revenues over
seven years. There would also be gains on the spending side of
the budget. More people working, and working at higher paying
jobs, would men a natural reduction in claims for income support
payments. These saving would mount with time.
<P>
Not all of the budget savings from faster economic growth and
lower interest rates would be available in the first few years
of the reform. But in light of the enormous potential benefits
of reform to the economy, the population, and the budget, it would
be reasonable to make a special effort to restrain the growth
of federal spending to accommodate the change in the tax system.

<U>Notes</U> 
<P>
1. A graduated rate variant of the savings exempt income tax comprises
the individual tax portion of the Nunn-Domenici USA (Unlimited
Saving Allowance) Tax proposal.
<P>
2. See Robert E. Hall and Alvin Rabushka, The Flat Tax, second
edition, Hoover Institution Press, Stanford University, Stanford,
CA, 1995. Several variations on the approach have been offered
by Representative Dick Armey and Senator Richard Shelby, Senator
Arlen Specter, and others.
<P>
3. National sales taxes have been discussed or proposed by Senator
Richard Lugar, House Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer, and
Representatives Bill Tauzin and Dan Schaefer, among others.
<P>
4. Value added taxes, collected by businesses at each stage of
production on the labor compensation they pay and the capital
income they receive, and manufacturers excise taxes, are the least
visible taxes of all. The Commission did not give serious consideration
to these taxes.
<P>
5. Border adjustability is often cited as an advantage of a national
sales tax (or of other so-called indirect taxes, such as a VAT).
However, most economists are skeptical that border adjustability
would benefit the U.S. economy as a whole. It would not, by itself,
increase total U.S. output and jobs. It would rearrange that output
somewhat, and shift resources accordingly, but to no apparent
purpose. We would produce more for export, and less for our own
use, and we would import more to fill in the gap. The balance
of payments would be largely unaffected, reflecting the same level
of international capital flows as before the changes. Jobs gained
in producing for export would be at the expense of jobs aimed
at production for domestic use. There would be adjustment costs
due to the change in production patterns, and potential efficiency
losses. Consumption-based taxes are not taxes on consumption.
They are taxes on the labor and capital income earned in producing
goods and services. The U.S. tax on workers and capital employed
in the United States ought not to vary depending on where their
products are sold. If Congress adopts a sales tax, consideration
should be given to choosing the origin-based variety, which is
the approach most consistent with simple territorial taxation.
<P>
6. Repayment of loans would be part of deductible net saving;
borrowing would be a taxable inflow, but only if used for consumption
and not repaid. Borrowing used to buy assets such as stocks, a
home, or a machine for one's business would not result in more
taxable income because the outlays would be deductible saving,
canceling the effect.
<P>
7. Charitable contributions would be deductible by the donor.
In theory, the recipients would take the contributions into income,
but in practice, there is no need to. Charities either distribute
their receipts to employees, researchers, students, or the poor,
etc., or save a portion, all of which are deductible activities.
The poor who receive charity would be too poor to owe tax. Current
law simply allows the charitable deduction and ignores the remaining
calculations.
<P>
8. In the pure form of this system, all payroll and state and
local taxes would be deductible. State and local taxes are outflows.
They largely fund welfare and other aid to the poor (income transfers
akin to charitable contributions to persons below taxable levels
of income) or education (a transfer that pays for the cost of
the recipient's acquisition of human capital), all of which could
be considered, in theory, to be reasonable deductions. Some state
and local services accrue to the individual taxpayer or homeowner,
however, and the amounts of these activities vary widely by states
and localities. The tax literature is divided on this deduction.
<P>
9. More generally, in a pure version of this tax, businesses would
not be taxable because their outflows would always equal their
inflows. Business inflows would include the revenues from sales
of goods and services and income on financial investments, plus
borrowing and sales of new shares to stockholders. Their outlays
would include operating costs (wages, purchases of materials,
inventory, outlays on research and development, rent and royalties
paid, etc.), taxes, dividend payments to shareholders, interest
payments to lenders, and investment in plant and equipment). Anything
left over for financial investment would be treated as tax deferred
saving on behalf of the shareholders.
<P>
10. State and local taxes are costs of doing business. If state
and local taxes are disallowed as deductions, businesses would
have to file tax forms just to pay federal tax on their state
and local taxes. This system works best, and achieves the greatest
degree of simplification, if all business expenses are deductible.
<P>
11. The version referred to is that introduced by Representative
Armey, which modified to original Hall-Rabushka system to allow
for the deductibility of pension contributions. Existing types
of pension arrangements (deductible contributions, taxable benefits)
would continue to be permitted under this bill, and may be liberalized.
<P>
12. The taxable income for financial institutions would be the
difference between interest received and paid, less wages and
other costs, as under current law. The problem arises because
many of the charges and fees of financial intermediaries are contained
in the spread between the interest rate they charge borrowers
customers and the rate they pay depositors (or, for brokerages,
the spread on securities transactions). If borrowers are not allowed
to deduct interest paid to the intermediaries, special rules would
be needed to tell the customers how much of the interest or other
charges they paid constitute the &quot;intermediation service&quot;
of the intermediary that is a deductible business expense.
<P>
13. Senator Arlen Specter (R-Pa) has introduced a version of this
tax with these two adjustments.

<h2>DEDUCTIONS AND TRADEOFFS</h2>
By Alan Reynolds</center>
<P>
<blockquote>
 Discussions of tax &quot;reform&quot; too often bypass the most
basic structural questions, such as what should be taxed and what
the tax rate should be, and jump ahead to the relatively peripheral
issue of itemized deductions for individuals.  
<P>
 The controversy is not about whether or not deductions will be
permitted in a new tax system.  All plans for a new tax system
would exempt low-income citizens in one way or another, through
standard or specific deductions, personal exemptions, exclusions,
adjustments or credits.  With the exception of cash rebates or
&quot;refundable&quot; tax credits (which are actually federal
spending programs run though the tax code), the various ways of
leaving some portion of  income untaxed have essentially the same
effect under a single tax rate.
<P>
 The issues are (1) how large should the total of such deductions
be, given the fact that having more deductions implies a higher
tax rate; and (2) what form should the deductions take.   Some
prefer a larger &quot;standard&quot; deduction and/or personal
exemption to specific  &quot;itemized&quot; deductions.  The issue
is sometimes posed as if specific deductions are to be eliminated
in order to get a lower tax rate, but that is not true if any
revenue gained from eliminating specific deductions  is devoted
to enlarging the standard deduction.  So long as the dollars involved
are the same, then either form of deduction reduces the amount
of income left to be taxed, and therefore keeps the tax rate higher
than otherwise.
<P>
 The Tax Reform Act of 1986 eliminated many specific deductions,
such as a deduction for state and local sales tax, for individual
health insurance premiums and for consumer  interest expense.
But this was matched by an increase in standard deductions and
personal exemptions.   The total of all deductions was 23.4% of
adjusted gross income in 1990-92, up from 23.1% in 1982-84.(1)
Only the form of deductions changed, not the amount.  
<P>
    A common concern is that unless<I> all </I>specific deductions
are eliminated, then not one can be eliminated.  The experience
of 1986 suggests that this is not necessarily true.  Several large
deductions were eliminated or severely curtailed after 1986, while
other specific deductions were not affected.
<P>
<I><B>Simplicity:  </B></I>Simplicity is not a very persuasive
argument when it comes to choosing between standard or itemized
deductions.  In recent years, the IRS has required detailed proof
of small charitable contributions, which is a minor nuisance.
 Yet the largest itemized deductions, for taxes and mortgage interest,
merely involve copying a number from one form to another and subtracting.
<P>
 The real sources of complexity for individuals include keeping
records on the buying and selling of houses, calculating the alternative
minimum tax (AMT), calculating the amount of Social Security benefits
subject to tax, calculating the phase-out of exemptions and deductions
at higher incomes, reporting investment income, determining which
interest expenses are deductible and which are not, and engaging
in estate planning.   All major plans for a new tax system would
eliminate all of these major sources of tax complexity, regardless
of whether any specific deduction was kept or not.   All new tax
plans would also eliminate the far greater complexities in defining
and reporting <I>business</I> income, including complex depreciation
schedules, AMT, and the elaborate system of taxes and credits
on income produced abroad.
<P>
  
<P>
<I><B>Fairness:  </B></I>In the past, a major fairness argument
has always been that itemized deductions or personal exemptions
were more valuable to those in higher tax brackets.  With a single
tax rate, this objection becomes irrelevant, because deductions
are equally valuable to all taxpayers.
<P>
 People in similar circumstances should bear similar burdens.
 On this basis, it might be argued that some itemized deductions
or exemptions are fair, because they measure income that people
no longer have at their disposal (such as alimony payments or
charitable contributions), or because they adjust for the fact
that families with many children actually have a higher poverty
threshold than smaller families with the same income.
<P>
<I><B>Neutrality:  </B></I>Another argument for getting rid of
certain deductions and exclusions might be that they violate &quot;neutrality,&quot;
distorting the allocation of resources in ways that might harm
the economy. Distortions have not often been mentioned in the
context of the few remaining  itemized deductions for individuals.
 Nobody complains, for example, that the deduction for charitable
contributions causes too much generosity.
<P>
 Some have  argued that the mortgage interest deduction unduly
favors investment in housing.  &quot;It is interesting,&quot;
writes Robert Hall, &quot;that although the personal tax treatment
of interest on borrowing against securities is identical to that
for houses, nobody has characterized the deduction of interest
on securities as a 'subsidy' to securities.&quot;(2)
<P>
 To the extent that the existing tax system has favored  housing
investment, it is largely because corporate investment is subject
to so many layers of taxation. The fact that capital gains on
houses can be rolled over into the same type of  investments is
not favoritism, except in comparison with the way other gains
are now taxed.   It is true that the shelter the home provides
(measured by the &quot;imputed rent&quot; that GNP accountants
assume homeowners &quot;pay&quot; themselves) is not taxed at
the federal level, but it is taxed by the property tax.
<P>
 Before the 1986 tax law, the individual deduction for sales tax
was a source of complexity, involving adding-up a lot of receipts
or using a rather arbitrary table that based estimated sales on
income.  To some degree this may mean that residents of states
with no income tax pay higher federal taxes so that residents
of states with high income taxes can claim a deduction.  People
with the same income are also treated differently depending on
where they live.  The fact that only income (and property) taxes
are now deductible for individuals may induce states and cities
to rely more heavily on the income tax, and less on the savings-neutral
sales tax.  
<P>
<I><B>Visibility:  </B></I>For businesses, state and local taxes
are costs of  producing  income, and therefore are deductible
expenses.  In many communities, the property tax is used to finance
services (such as trash collection) that are financed by deductible
fees to private providers in other communities. Sales taxes on
business materials and equipment are deductible, since they are
part of other deductible costs of doing business.  For individuals,
state and local taxes are not costs of producing income, but to
some degree, are the price of consumed public services.  That
price should be visible.  Deductibility of certain state and local
taxes may reduce the visibility of those taxes.  However, some
of the revenue raised by state and local taxation supports education
and income transfers to the poor, which are tax-deductible transfers
when achieved through private charities, and which represent the
transfer of income from the taxpayer to the ultimate recipient
of the income.  This is a gray area requiring further study.
<P>
<I><B>Symmetry:  </B></I>The amount of revenue lost through deductions
often depends on whether or not the operating principle of <I>symmetry
</I>is maintained.  With perfect symmetry, any deductible expense
to one taxpayer would normally be taxable income to the person
or company that receives that money.  With a single tax rate,
the net effect on revenue is roughly zero.
<P>
 The mortgage interest deduction, for example, need not involve
any significant revenue loss so long as symmetry is maintained
-- that is, so long as lenders are required to pay taxes on the
interest income they receive.(3) One could retain current law
practice -- allowing homeowners to deduct their mortgage interest
and requiring the lenders to pay tax on it -- with little or no
adverse effect on the tax rate.  Not deducting the interest and
not taxing it is somewhat simpler than deducting the interest
and taxing it, but it yields very similar after-tax results for
both borrowers and lenders.  Under current law, mortgage lenders
charge a rate that includes the tax they must pay on the interest,
but borrowers save a corresponding portion of the interest rate
because the interest they pay is tax deductible.  Under the alternative
treatment, the lender would charge a lower tax-free rate about
equal to the after-tax rate borrowers face now.
<P>
 Exclusions in current law violate several principles.  Non-pension
fringe benefits are labor costs that are deductible by the employer
but are excluded from the taxable income of the employee (a violation
of symmetry).  Health care and cafeteria plans are the biggest
examples.  Excluding fringe benefits from taxable income makes
them relatively more attractive than cash wages, leading people
to buy more of the favored services and products than they otherwise
would (violating neutrality and distorting output).  The exclusion
has led most working Americans to obtain health insurance for
themselves and their families through employer-provided health
plans. These plans hide a portion of workers' compensation, limit
people's control over their health plans, and result in third
party payment systems that hide costs and lead people to treat
health care as a (nearly) free good (violating visibility).  The
consequence is over-use of the health care system that drives
up insurance costs for families and businesses and increases federal
and state government outlays for health care for the poor and
the elderly.
<P>
  Each deduction, exclusion, adjustment and tax credit needs to
be held up against the principles of sound taxation and judged
on its merits. The choice between standard and specific deductions
is less important than the overall size of all types of deductions.
 If the public prefers that a large amount of revenue be devoted
to deductions or exclusions, regardless of what form those deductions
or exclusions take, then the tax rate must be higher than otherwise,
or federal spending must be reduced.

<h2>INCOME TAX TREATMENT OF PAYROLL TAXES AND SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS</h2> 
By Stephen Entin</center><P>
<blockquote>
The deduction, as allowed in current law, of the employer's half
of the payroll tax as a business expense should be retained. Consideration
should be given to allowing individuals to deduct their half of
the payroll tax from taxable income as well. The increases in
the 1993 budget agreement in the amount of social security benefits
subject to income tax should be rolled back, and the method of
taxing benefits in the future should be reformed. The social security
earnings test should be eased or eliminated.
<P>
Retention of the employer's deduction would ease the transition
to a new tax system by avoiding the need to alter existing labor
contracts and compensation, and would avoid imposing a tax on
a tax. A similar deduction for the employee's half would lower
the burden of the tax on employment and labor income.
<P>
<I>Deduction of payroll taxes and amount of benefits taxed.</I>
Under current law, the 15.3% payroll tax that supports the social
security system is nominally levied half on employers and half
on employees.(2) Employers may deduct their half of the payroll
tax as a business expense (labor cost) in computing their taxable
income under the income tax. Individuals are not allowed an itemized
deduction of their half of the tax. The self-employed may deduct
half of their payroll tax payments, corresponding to the employer's
deduction. Since 1983, individuals and married taxpayers above
certain incomes have had to pay tax on up to 50% of their social
security retirement and disability benefits (corresponding to
the half of the payroll tax contributions that had been deducted
by employers). In the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993
(OBRA93), that percentage was increased to as much as 85% for
upper middle income taxpayers.
<P>
It would make sense to treat the retirement and disability portion
of the payroll taxes and social security benefits as if they were
pension arrangements. Contributions should be deductible, and,
ultimately, an appropriate portion of the retirement and disability
benefits received should be taxable. Medicare taxes and benefits
could be treated like private health insurance.
<P>
Current recipients of social security benefits should not have
to pay tax on more than half of current benefits, because only
half of the payroll taxes (the employer's share) collected on
their earnings during their working years were deductible. Consequently,
the percent of benefits subject to tax should be reduced immediately
from 85% to 50%. If individuals are allowed to deduct the individual
portion of the payroll tax in the future, then increasing amounts
of retirement and disability benefits should eventually be subjected
to tax. Because people now in the work force will not have been
allowed such a deduction for a portion of their working lives,
the amount of benefits potentially subject to tax should rise
<I>very</I> slowly, increasing slightly for each new group of
people reaching retirement age, and taking 40 years (a working
lifetime) to reach 100%.
<P>
Under current law and demographics, an increasing number of future
retirees will receive less in benefits than they have paid in
payroll taxes (in present value), and would be better off deducting
the tax than escaping tax on the benefits.(3) Note, too, that
current law is already increasing the taxation of benefits over
time, even for current retirees (and without an additional deduction),
because the income thresholds people have to reach before benefits
are taxed are not indexed for inflation.
<P>
The Hall-Rabushka Flat Tax and its variations take the opposite
approach to neutral treatment of the social security system. They
eliminate the employer deduction for payroll taxes, and, correspondingly,
eliminate all taxes on benefits. This is a theoretically equivalent
approach over a working lifetime; the share of benefits taxed
equals the share of payroll taxes deducted. However, the transition
to that system would require altering current wage and salary
agreements affecting all workers and businesses, and would provide
a windfall to current beneficiaries on benefits corresponding
to previously deducted taxes.
<P>
Going further in the other direction to allow both employers and
employees a credit for payroll taxes would go well beyond normal
treatment of pensions or saving. Folding the payroll tax into
the income tax rate structure in this manner would require higher
tax rates on wages, salaries, and the returns on private saving.
There are other ways to deal with the problems posed by payroll
taxes without raising the income tax rate structure to that degree.
If further relief from the payroll tax is required, it would be
preferable to allow individuals to redirect a portion of it into
their own private retirement arrangements.
<P>
<I>Reforming how benefits are taxed.</I> Whatever percent of benefits
is deemed taxable in the future, the current method of taxing
the benefits must be scrapped. It is totally inconsistent with
a single tax rate system, and is an outrage even under a graduated
rate system. The current tax on benefits is really a tax on other
retirement income - interest, dividends, pensions, annuities,
and wages - at super-normal tax rates, as that other income exceeds
certain thresholds. These super-normal tax rates are an extreme
penalty on private saving and strongly urge young workers to avoid
saving for retirement.
<P>
Retirees subject to the taxation of benefits must add $0.50 in
social security benefits to taxable income for each dollar that
their income exceeds $25,000 for single filers and $32,000 for
couples, until half of benefits are taxed. They must add $0.85
to taxable income for each dollar of income over $34,000 for single
filers and $44,000 for couples until 85% of benefits are taxed.
Earning an extra dollar of interest, dividend, pension, or annuity
income can add $1.50 or $1.85 to taxable income, effectively increasing
marginal tax rates to 1.5 or 1.85 times normal levels. For someone
in the 28 percent tax bracket, there is a marginal tax rate of
42 percent or 52 percent on an additional dollar of interest.
On wages subject to the payroll tax, marginal tax rates can reach
56 percent to 65 percent. Rates can range from 85 percent to 115
percent on wages when the worker is also subject to the social
security earnings test. (See below.) The income thresholds are
not adjusted for inflation. By the time the baby boom finishes
retiring, nearly all beneficiaries will be paying tax on some
portion of their benefits.
<P>
The 50 percent and 85 percent phase-ins of benefits into taxable
income should be eliminated to remove the spikes in the marginal
tax rates. Whatever part of benefits should be taxable should
simply be added to other taxable income. This should impose no
hardship on those not paying tax on benefits under current law
(a diminishing number over time as inflation erodes the thresholds)
if personal and family exempt amounts under the income tax are
raised to more generous levels under tax restructuring. If higher
exempt amounts and reduced taxation of savings income under tax
restructuring are not deemed sufficient to shelter lower income
elderly taxpayers from taxation of benefits, either of two alternative
allowances could be adopted. An additional exempt amount could
be allowed for the elderly. Alternatively, some dollar amount
of social security benefits, for example, $2,000 for a single
retiree, $3,000 for a couple receiving the 50 percent spousal
benefit, and up to $4,000 for a two-worker couple, could be made
tax exempt. Benefits above the exempt amounts would simply be
added to taxable income, up to the maximum taxable fraction in
force for each age group.
<P>
<I>Easing the social security earnings test.</I> Substantial increases
in the social security earnings test, or its complete elimination,
are essential to encourage continued contributions by the most
experienced part of the labor force. Easing the earnings test
would remove an enormous barrier to productive participation by
persons age 62 through 69 in the labor force. It would enable
them to raise their incomes, and would raise income and payroll
tax receipts by more than it would increase government outlays.
Everyone would gain.
<P>
The earnings test reduces social security benefits by one third
(for recipients ages 65-69) or one-half (for recipients ages 62-64)
of wage and salary income in excess of very modest exempt amounts.
These cuts are equivalent to 33-1/3% and 50% tax rates on the
affected income, on top of income and payroll tax rates. At incomes
of only $15,000 to $25,000, combined marginal tax rates on wages
can reach 65 percent to 85 percent. At incomes of $25,000 to $60,000,
taxation of benefits and the earnings test can generate marginal
tax rates of 85 percent to 115 percent, blatantly confiscatory.

<B>Notes</B> 
<P>
1. Of the total, 12.4% supports social security retirement and
disability benefits, and 2.9% supports Medicare Part A hospital
insurance benefits.
<P>
2. An alternative, more complicated approach to taxing benefits
is to exclude an amount equal to the taxes individuals paid into
the system, and tax the excess. This would be done on an &quot;annuitzed
basis&quot; -- a portion of each year's benefits, based on one's
earnings history and life expectancy, would be attributed to tax
payments, and the remainder would be taxable. For people who retired
many years ago, and who will get back far more in benefits than
they paid in taxes, the taxable share of benefits would be quite
high. Future recipients will get back far less, relative to their
tax payments, and would have a much smaller share of benefits
subject to tax. The percentage would vary by individual, by marital
status, and by generation.

<h2>SIMPLIFY INTERNATIONAL TAXATION</h2>
By Stephen Entin</center><P>
<blockquote> Taxation of personal and business income earned abroad is a very
complicated feature of the current income tax code.  Congress
should consider a territorial tax system to replace the global
system in current law.  That is, the U.S. tax should be imposed
on all income generated within the borders of the United States,
whether by U.S. residents or foreigners.  Conversely, income earned
outside the United States by U.S. businesses and individuals should
be not be subject to U.S. taxes.(1)
<P>
 Unlike most nations, the United State taxes the repatriated global
income of its businesses that operate subsidiaries or partnerships
abroad, after allowance of a tax credit for foreign income taxes
paid.  U.S. firms with operations in foreign countries owe tax
on their repatriated earnings if the tax rate in the foreign country
is less than that in the United States.  U.S. individuals also
owe U.S. tax on their interest or dividend income from foreign
investments after a similar tax credit.  Wages and salaries earned
abroad by Americans are subject to similar treatment on amounts
above $70,000.  Conversely, the costs of some activities carried
out in the United States are treated, for tax purposes, as if
they were foreign, as with the complicated allocation rules regarding
the cost of research and development.
<P>
 The foreign tax provisions are among the most complex features
of the U.S. tax code.  They impose immense costs of compliance
to U.S. taxpayers and very high enforcement costs to the IRS for
only a small gain to the Treasury.  The U.S. tax code would be
simpler, and the income of U.S. residents would be greater, if
the United States were to adopt territorial taxation.
<P>
 The attempt to tax foreign earnings of U.S. businesses raises
relatively little revenue.  It merely discourages repatriation
of business income earned abroad to the United States for reinvestment
or distribution to shareholders or other owners.  Firms do not
repatriate their foreign earnings unless they have sufficient
foreign tax credits to avoid the extra tax. Nonetheless, the damage
done by the current system to particular U.S. businesses is substantial,
in terms of high compliance costs and lost competitiveness.
<P>
 The foreign tax provisions of the internal revenue code put U.S.
businesses and individuals at a considerable competitive disadvantage
in global markets, and generally reduce total world-wide investment
by, and income of, U.S. residents.  Other nations have income
tax systems that are primarily territorial.  They do not impose
taxes on the foreign earnings of their resident businesses or
individuals.  Consequently, U.S. firms operating in a foreign
country with corporate tax rates that are lower than in the U.S.
are at a competitive disadvantage compared with firms from most
European or Asian countries, because only the U.S. firms would
owe a second layer of tax to the country in which its parent company
is based.  Similarly, American workers abroad in low tax countries,
and the companies that employ them, are at a disadvantage relative
to foreign workers and firms in such locations.
<P>
 The global tax system of the United States discourages U.S. firms
from engaging in production or other activities abroad, or pressures
U.S. businesses to structure foreign business operations in particular
forms purely for tax reasons.   This should not be a goal of tax
policy.  Imposing higher taxes on foreign operations of U.S. businesses
does not improve the U.S. investment climate, and does not add
to domestic investment.  Insofar as it discourages investment
abroad, however, it costs domestic U.S. operations billions of
dollars in sales to potential foreign subsidiaries and partnerships
that were never formed.   Under some circumstances, the opposite
problem arises; other U.S. tax provisions sometimes force foreign
subsidiaries to invest in foreign projects at the expense of U.S.
projects to avoid additional U.S. taxes, clearly a perverse result.
<P>
 In recent years, the United States has imported capital because
investment has far exceeded domestic saving.  The new tax system
will undoubtedly encourage domestic saving, but it will probably
attract foreign capital too by making the United States a particularly
attractive place in which to invest.  A capital importing country
may raise more revenue from a simple territorial tax system than
from a system based on the residence of the investor.
<P>
 Whatever new tax system is chosen, there must be a clearer, simpler,
and more certain determination of what income is foreign or domestic,
or what international transaction is taxable, than under current
law.  The current confusion over transfer pricing must be eliminated.
 In addition, attention must be given to the proper tax treatment
of foreign source license fees and royalties so as not to discourage
research and development in the United States.

 <b>Note</b>
<P>
1.  These results would occur naturally under an origin-based
sales tax or VAT and a returns-exempt income tax, and could be
designed into a saving-deferred income tax.  The sales tax, VAT,
and returns-exempt income tax would be collected at the business
level before dividends and interest were paid to lenders and shareholders,
including foreigners.  Under the saving-deferred tax, in which
businesses pass income on to lenders and shareholders for taxation,
business payments to foreigners could be made subject to withholding,
much like current law, so that they need not file tax returns.
 Interest payments to foreigners on federal government bonds do
not represent returns on business investment or economic activity,
and, as under current law, would not be subject to withholding.
 Destination-based sales taxes and VATs that rebate the tax at
the border are not territorial.

<blockquote>
<hr>

<P>
The National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax
Reform is holding a series of public hearings to investigate problems
with the current income tax system and principles of tax reform.
<P>
Senate Leader Bob Dole and House Speaker Newt Gingrich
have charged our 14-member commission with making recommendations
for a tax code that is &quot;flatter, fairer, and simpler&quot;
-- a system that will encourage economic growth and greater opportunity
for all Americans.
<P>
Senator Dole and Speaker Gingrich asked commissioners
to study ways in which the current tax code -- with its &quot;high
marginal tax rates and thousands of pages of rules, regulations,
and red tape -- poses a barrier to economic growth.&quot; As they
said:
<UL>
<LI>It punishes the most dynamic forces for growth
in our economy -- the small business owners and entrepreneurs
who turn bold ideas into new businesses, new jobs, and new products.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>It discourages working Americans who are trying
to save for the future and to build a better life for themselves
and their families.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>It is endlessly complex and confusing, costing
literally billions of dollars in lost time and effort.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
One of the most important aspects of our work is
to talk with Americans from all walks of life -- small business
people, farmers, factory workers, inventors, and entrepreneurs
-- who make America work. We will be holding hearings across the
country over the next several months to talk with taxpayers and
to hear from experts who study tax policy.
<P>
We believe that tax reform must move toward making
the tax code more family friendly and create incentives for savings
and investment.  We want to help guide the debate toward changes
that will reinvigorate entrepreneurship, risk taking, savings,
investment, and work effort.  And we hope to contribute to changes
that will make America more competitive and expand the nation's
worldwide leadership in the 21st century economy. 
<P>
We know far too much about what doesn't work, and
we know that those who are hurt the most by bad public policies,
especially tax policy, are those at the bottom of the economic
ladder. 
<P>
While there is overwhelming anger and frustration
with the current system, we need to explore more about citizens'
experiences with problems and solutions before we can go forward
with radical change.
<P>
For example, what are the implications to the economy
of a steeply progressive tax system? What is the impact on economic
growth of higher marginal tax rates? What do people mean whey
they say they want a &quot;fairer&quot; tax system?  What do we
mean by &quot;flatter&quot; tax rates?  There are a lot of different
views, and we want to know what the American people think and
what are the ramifications.
<P>
I am proud to serve with the distinguished men and
women on this commission who have offered to give of their time
and energy and talents so that all Americans can have a better
chance at the American dream. Individually and collectively, my
colleagues on the commission have a huge font of knowledge, experience,
and courage that can help guide our work.
<P>
We are setting the stage for a 21st century tax policy
for America.  It is imperative that everyone work together to
advance this monumental task.  
<P>
What we are undertaking may feel at times like moving
a mountain. Making the tax code simpler will be a very complicated
process.
<P>
We hope that this series of hearings -- in which
both citizens and experts present views -- will help all of us
to learn more and to make better informed decisions about the
hard choices that lie ahead. If we can find the core, central
principles of a new vision for tax reform that includes everyone's
views, we can get this done. The American people -- and our children
and grandchildren-- will be the winners.

DOLE & GINGRICH FORM NATIONAL COMMISSION ON ECONOMIC GROWTH
& TAX REFORM: JACK KEMP TO SERVE AS CHAIRMAN OF NINE MEMBER PANEL
"TO DESIGN A SYSTEM THAT IS FLATTER, FAIRER, & SIMPLER"</center>
<p>
Today, Speaker Gingrich and I are pleased to announce the formation of the National Commission on
Economic Growth and Tax Reform. We're especially pleased to announce that Jack Kemp has agreed to lead this commission by serving as chairman.
<p>
As you all know, Jack is one of our country's most passionate voices on behalf of economic growth and
expanded opportunity for all Americans. For more than two decades, from his service in Congress to his
leadership of Empower America, Jack has been one of our party's most innovative thinkers on economic policy. No one within the GOP can speak to these issues more creatively and more credibly than Jack Kemp.
<p>
Our current federal tax code -- with its high marginal rates and thousands of pages of rules, regulations and red tape -- poses a formidable barrier to economic growth.
<p>
It punishes the most dynamic forces for growth in our economy -- the small business owners and
entrepreneurs who turn bold ideas into new businesses, new jobs, and new products.
<p>
It discourages working Americans who are trying to save for the future in order to build a better life for
themselves and their families.
<p>
It is endlessly complex and confusing, costing literally billions of dollars in lost time and effort.
<p>
Speaker Gingrich is moving important tax legislation through the House right now -- a vital step toward
making the tax code more family-friendly and creating some incentives for saving and investment.
<p>
But the purpose of this commission is to move beyond tax reform toward a complete overhaul of the
entire tax system. That's why we have asked Jack to reexamine the entire 9,000 page federal tax code: to start with a blank piece of paper and design a system that is flatter, fairer, and simpler -- one that will
encourage strong economic growth and greater opportunity for all our people.
<p>
The commission will consist of eight members, plus the chairman. Four will be appointed by me and four
by the Speaker. It will issue a report by late September.
<p>
I look forward to working with Jack and Newt and receiving the commission's recommendations.

<p>
<b><a name="Chairman Kemp">CHAIRMAN KEMP</a></b>: (In progress) -- is an old friend of Carroll Campbell's and mine and several members, Ed Feulner.
<p> 
And on April 3rd of this year, Bob Dole, Speaker Gingrich -- Majority Leader Bob Dole --announced a commission, the National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform.  It's a view that you share.  It's a view that Americans share on both sides of the aisle.  
<p> 
 We're going to hear today not only from:  Bill Archer, Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee; 
But Dick Gephardt, the Minority Leader;  The Majority Leader of the House, Dick Armey; Senators Nunn and Domenici, who are very active, as you've been, Mr. Chairman, in Senate tax reform. And then Senator Packwood, Chairman of the Finance Committee; And Connie Mack, Chairman of the Joint Economic 
Committee. 

On that April 3rd, Senator Dole charged us with 
reforming -- or coming up with a reform that leads to a flatter, 
fairer, simpler, lower tax rate system that creates opportunity 
for all Americans and leads, of course, to economic growth.<p> 
 
		On May 24th, he, along with Speaker Gingrich, announced 
the Commissioners.
 
		Bill, you know all of us.  But I'd like for you to meet 
more formally: 
 
			Shirley Peterson, former Commissioner of the IRS 
under Ronald Reagan.   
 
			Carroll Campbell, you need no introduction to, but 
Governor Campbell is president and chief executive officer of the 
American Council of Life Insurance.
 
			Ken Blackwell, an old friend of yours.  He was 
deputy at HUD under me and State treasurer of the state of Ohio.
 
			And Dean Kleckner, American Farm Bureau president.<p> 
 
			On my right, your left,<p>
 
Mr. Chairman, is Ed Feulner, president of Heritage Foundation.<p> 
 
			On his right, Herman Cain, chief executive officer 
of Godfather's Pizza.
 
			Matt Fong, state treasurer of the state of 
California.
 
			Jack Faris of the National Federation of 
Independent Business, our Nation's leading advocate for small and 
independent and entrepreneurial business. 
 
			And John Wieland, the president of John Wieland 
Homes, homebuilder from Atlanta.<p>
		Men and women who share your concern, Mr. Chairman, 
about the Tax Code and what it's doing to the American economy, 
its competitiveness, our ability to create more jobs, all the 
things that Bill Archer is well known for in his many years of 
service.
 
		We're just a citizens' commission.  These are not 
hearings, per se.   
 
		We would like you to tell us, 
 
Mr. Chairman, what are some of the issues and problems with the 
Tax Code and the tax system that has led to your involvement in 
this massive effort to dramatically change the Tax Code for the 
American people?<p> 
 
		We'd like to hear 10, 15 minutes off the top of your 
head, and from the heart, what you think those problems arem, 
allow us to dialogue with you. and have a chance to visit on this 
issue.  <p> 
 
		And then Senators Nunn and Domenici will be here in 
about 40 minutes or so.
		I would just conclude my opening comment by saying I 
got involved in tax reform by reading a speech by John F. Kennedy 
in 1962, in which he said that:  "It's a paradoxical truth that 
high tax rates lead to low tax revenues."  		
 
		And the best way to get more revenue was to get the 
economy growing again and remove this obstacle to the American 
people working and saving and investing in the American economy.<p> 
I had always been intrigued by that, because that led 
to the Reagan tax cut of '81, what you and I supported, the 
reduction in rates.  And, Bill, I just want to say it's a personal pleasure, 
as well as an official pleasure, fur me to welcome the colleague 
with whom I came to the Congress in 1970, and an old and dear 
friend, the Honorable chairman of this prestigious and august 
committee, the Honorable Bill Archer of Houston, Texas.  Thanks, Bill.

               Your recommendations when you conclude your 
deliberations will become extremely important as a lever-pull on 
what happens in the Congress of the United States relative to 
taxes.
 <p>
It is appropriate, I think, Jack, that these hearings 
be conducted in this room, because it was completed in the '30s 
and has been the situs for all of the roller-coaster changes in 
the income tax subsequent to that time for approaching 60 years 
now.<p> 
 And over and over again, well-meaning, thoughtful 
people have met in this room, determined that they could fix the 
income tax, that they could reform it, make it less obtrusive, 
make it more productive, make it simpler, make it fairer, make it 
accommodate growth.<p> 
 	I sat up there at the tier above you in 1986, and I can 
remember the proposal then that came to us -- and I think, 
Carroll, I believe you were here at that time -- from Ronald 
Reagan, delivered by his Secretary of the Treasury, my old friend 
Jimmy Baker.<p> 
 	And he sat at this spot with what was going to be the 
ultimate in a proposal for tax reform.  	
 <p>
And on the fly sheet of that 500-page summary was noted 
the title, "Fairness, Growth, and Simplicity."  <p> 
 	And the end result of that deliberation of the 
"ultimate in reform" was the most complicated tax system in the 
history of this country and perhaps the most complicated in the 
world.<p> 
 	I am convinced that it no longer serves the best 
interests of working, tax-paying Americans.  <p> 
 	And I believe the time has come for us to think very 
boldly as we look for an agenda for the next century that will 
increase savings, increase productivity, and permit America to 
reach its rightful place in a global marketplace, to become the 
economic juggernaut of the world.<p> 
 	That is my dream for this country.  And I believe the 
way that we collect taxes can have a major impact on that.<p> 
 	The current system is defended by no one.  <p> 
 	In the three days of hearings that this committee had a 
week before last, not one single voice was raised in support of 
the current income tax system, neither from the witness chairs 
nor from any person that sat on the committee, Democrat or 
Republican.<p> 
 	I challenged the administration, because they said, in 
answer to a question that I put to the Assistant Secretary for 
Tax Policy -- "If you were start a system today from scratch that 
would serve the best interests of this country, recognizing that 
we must raise money to pay the government's bills, so we must 
collect taxes in one form or another.  If you were to start today 
from scratch in a brand new country, would you put in place the 
current income tax system?"<p> 
 And the answer was a resounding no.<p> 
 My next question was:  "Will you have a proposal for us 
to replace the current income tax?"  And I did not receive a 
definitive answer.<p> 
 I hope that the message has gotten back to the White 
House, because I hope that they would be able to have a witness 
to come and tell you what they propose to change this tax system.<p> 
 Clearly, any system that requires a minimum of $300 
billion a year in compliance costs is broken, very badly broken.  
And in my opinion, I don't believe it can be fixed.  <p> 
 As probably each of you knows, I am the first chairman 
who continues to do his income tax return.  <p> 
 And I have always said, a little bit tongue in cheek, 
that if we could pass a law requiring every Member of Congress to 
do their own income tax, we would probably have a much better Tax 
Code.<p> 
 But I have made the statement that I will either fix it 
or I will suffer through it personally to try to understand 
exactly the burden that is being placed on each American 
taxpayer.  It's a very interesting exercise, very time-consuming, 
as each of you knows.<p> 
 But $300 billion minimum in compliance  costs, because 
<i>Fortune</i> magazine says it's <p> 
 $592 billion a year in compliance costs if you consider every 
possible factor.  <p> 
 I'll settle for $300 billion, to make my argument -- 
I've been termed a conservative, so I'll use the conservative 
number -- is employing some of the best minds, some of the 
greatest creativity in this country in nonproductivity.  <p> 
 Just think  with me, for a moment, if those minds were 
out creating wealth instead of trying to figure a way to make an 
end run around this complicated, very vague tax system that we 
have, how much better off all of us would be in this country.<p> 
 I think that we can go to great lengths to see that 
happen.<p> 
 In addition, we have found -- and I'm sorry to say, to 
a great extent, during years where my preferred individual was in 
the White House -- the concept that we cannot raise taxes, but we 
must find a way to get more revenue -- and Shirley Peterson knows 
very well about this -- by the collection process under the 
current tax system.  And that way nobody pays any more taxes.  <p> 
 Just give the IRS more power, more penalties, and they 
will raise more money, and we're not increasing anybody's taxes.  <p> 
 That year-after-year approach that began in the '80s 
and continues to this very day, where the Congress appropriates 
money to the IRS and says, "This is for compliance, you must 
produce more," puts tremendous pressure on the IRS to become more 
intrusive into our lives.<p> 
 And the American people now finally ring out with a 
giant chorus of support when I say I want to get the IRS 
completely and totally out of your individual lives.  <p> 
 And I would hope that that would be one of the goals 
that you would attempt to reach when you make your final 
recommendation as to the way you think taxes should be collected 
in this country.<p> 
 I personally do not believe that we can simply reform 
or simplify the Income Tax Code.  I think we must tear the income 
tax out by its roots so that it can never grow back again.<p> 
 That is another goal.  And if we do so, we will get the 
IRS completely and totally out of the lives of every individual 
in this country, so that they have to keep no records whatsoever, 
can never be audited, and can never be brought before the IRS to 
prove their innocence.<p> 
 That is a giant step, in my opinion, to reach the goal 
of greater privacy, greater freedom for individual Americans.<p> 
 As we do that, if we do it, we will also reduce the 
cost of compliance dramatically.  There are 130 million tax 
returns roughly that are submitted every year today.  We can cut 
those down. if we get the IRS out of the individual lives of 
people, to a few million. Businesses always have to keep 
records, and businesses should be the location point for the 
collection of taxes, because taxes have to come from somewhere. <p> 
I think whatever system that you recommend should also 
be perceived as fair.  But fairness often is like "beauty in the 
eye of the beholder" and is subject to different interpretations 
and different views by different people.<p> 
  believe that it is fair to a great degree if it 
creates, as you said, Mr. Chairman, economic opportunity for 
workers to realize their dream, which is more family -- real 
family income in their paychecks.  <p> 
 And we just saw the report this week that real wages 
have declined to the biggest percentage in quite a long period of 
time.  <p> 
 Real wages will increase, as we all know -- and Jack 
and I have espoused this for the 25 years that we've known each 
other -- by increasing productivity and thereby having more 
wealth, more real value to spread around amongst working 
Americans.<p> 
 Productivity, I believe, in simple economic terms, is 
the result of materials plus labor, multiplied by tools.  The 
multiplying factor is tools.  <p> 
 Now, admittedly, mental capability to use the tools -- 
and education becomes a part of the process, too. <p> 
 But if we do not have capital savings, we will not have 
updated tools.  <p> 
 If we do not have capital savings, we won't have 
investment to update tools.  And we will therefore not be able to 
upgrade productivity, and we will merely be fighting each other 
to see who has the greatest leverage to get a bigger piece of the 
pie.<p> 
 So, whatever Tax Code we have in place should be the 
greatest possible incentive for savings.<p> 
Thirdly, whatever you recommend, in my opinion, to be 
considered fair by the American people. should have the greatest 
opportunity to get at the underground economy.  <p> 
 The GAO testified right from this chair a couple of 
weeks ago that we are losing <p> 
$120 billion a year in unpaid income taxes -- and Shirley 
Peterson is well aware of this, having been commissioner of the 
IRS -- just from legal operations, not including illegal 
operations.<p> 
 And I believe we can build a better system so that 
Americans who do pay their taxes will not be off-loaded with 15 
percent higher taxes as a result of other Americans not paying 
their fair share.<p> 
And then finally -- although probably not totally 
finally, but for major points -- we need, in my opinion, a tax 
system that will help us win the battle in the global commercial 
marketplace.<p> 
 I have a friend -- and, Jack, you and I both have 
probably had many friends who would identify with this.  <p> 
 I have a friend that says "I'm a very fair individual.  
All I ever want is a fair advantage."<p> 
And what I want for the United States of America is a 
fair advantage, a tax that can be removed from the price of our 
products when they are exported so that the cost of government -- 
which, Jack Faris, you know, as a small businessperson or person 
representing small business -- and, Herman, you know, also, from 
your business operations -- a tax that must be passed on, as a 
cost of doing business, in the price of your product.  <p> 
 The income tax can never be removed from the price of 
the product.  It remains a cost and must be borne when we export 
those products.<p> 
We need a tax that can be removed and charged to 
incoming foreign products so that they bear a fair share of our 
cost of government.  <p> 
All GATT or WTL are legal, so that we do not 
precipitate a trade war, which we're now a little apprehensive 
about at this moment for what's happening in Geneva.<p> 
 These would be the goals that I would hope you would 
try to obtain in your deliberations.  They are the goals I set 
for myself.  <p> 
 I have come to the conclusion that the only way we can 
reach these goals is to transfer taxes from income to taxing 
goods and services, to get completely out of the income arena.<p> 
 Perhaps you will find a way to do it without getting 
out of the income arena.<p> 
 I do not have a specific proposal to make to you today, 
other than I am determined, in my tenure as chairman of the Ways 
and Means Committee, to make every possible effort to reach the 
goals that I just mentioned, because I believe we can win the 
battle in the international marketplace.  <p> 
 I believe we have every reason to hope and pray that we 
will not settle our differences on military battlefields in the 
next century.  But we must win the battle in the international 
marketplace, commercially.  And we need every fair advantage that 
we can get in that battle. 				<p> 
 So, I thank you for listening.  This is not a 10-second 
sound bite operation.  This is a massive undertaking.  <p> 
 It's an undertaking that each of you can play a major 
role in.  And I welcome your advice and your counsel.  <p> 
 And again, I thank you very, very much for taking the 
time out of your personal lives to take on what I think is 
perhaps one of the most important roles in what is a truly 
watershed period in this country's history.<p> 
 Thank you, Mr. Chairman.<p> 
 <b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Bill, thank you.  <p> 
 That was -- the American people owe you a debt of 
gratitude.  To have a chairman of the Ways and Means Committee 
with the devotion that you reflect every day of your political 
career, and particularly in this area, is just an awesome 
thought, to think that our chairman of Ways and Means is 
committed to this type of approach that, in effect, would just 
take the whole Code out, establish a tabula rasa, a clean slate, 
and start over, and act like we are at the Constitutional 
Convention in 1787, and level the playing field, and do the type 
of things that you have alluded to.<p> 
 Since you mentioned the IRS so many times, I think it's 
appropriate that we start with the former Commissioner, Shirley 
Peterson, Shirley.<p> 
 <b>COMMISSIONER PETERSON</b>:  Mr. Chairman, thank you very 
much for agreeing to be here today.  <p> 
 
		As a member of this Commission, I thank you for 
agreeing to participate in this dialogue.  As a citizen of this 
great country, I thank you for the leadership that you are 
showing in this effort to restructure the tax system.<p> 
 
		As you may know, I have been long a proponent of 
repealing the Internal Revenue Code and starting over.  <p> 
 
		And I was struck by a couple of points that you made, 
particularly the points about burden and compliance.  <p> 
 
		It's my own view that the difficulties that we face in 
the tax system, both in its administration and in encouraging 
people to apply and in administering and enforcing the law, 
derived primarily from the complexity of the law.  <p> 
 
		And I would welcome any comments that you have to guide 
this Commission as we go forward with our considerations about 
simplifying the law.  I assume that that's one of your principal 
goals as well, to simplify the law. 		<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARCHER</b>:  Absolutely.  <p> 
 
		But, Shirley, I guess maybe I've become a little bit 
cynical, having sat on this committee now for 22 years and 
witnessing the ever-repeating efforts to simplify the Tax Code.<p> 
 
		And I'm -- I also almost think of "reform" as a jaded 
term, because so often we have said, "We're going to reform and 
we're going to simplify."  <p> 
 
		And inevitably, in the process, more and more 
complexities creep in.  <p> 
 
		And I am afraid that that is just the nature of an 
income-based tax.  When you tax income, you tax work, you tax 
productivity, and inevitably you have great differences as to 
defining the terms of "income."  What is "income"?  <p> 
 
		That, again, is another reason why I personally believe 
we should look at taxing goods and services, which can be 
precise, not that there aren't problems.  There are problems with 
whatever you do.<p> 
 
		But I just am not sure that we can, in the end, end up 
with a simple Tax Code if we use income as the base. <p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER PETERSON</b>:  I think your point is very well 
taken, Mr. Chairman.<p> 
 
		And certainly in the work, as I think about it, as this 
Commission approaches it, I hope that we will be thinking about 
restructuring the system and not simply about a reform of the 
current system.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Let me just inform the Commissioners 
that we're just going to go back and forth, give everybody an 
opening round and get to as many questions for Bill in this 
dialogue as possible.<p> 
 
		Ed Feulner.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER FEULNER</b>:  Mr. Chairman, I, too, thank you 
for your insights and your continued leadership for so many 
years.  <p> 
 
		One principle that I've not heard you discuss this 
morning that is of concern to me is the notion that, admitted 
that the government has to collect X amount in order to pay its 
bills, as you said, I believe at least that the way it collects 
it ought to be visible and it ought to basically be painful in 
order to put an incentive on the politicians here in Washington 
to not raise it beyond that given level.<p> 
 
		Would you talk to us a little bit about visibility and 
how that relates to different reform proposals.  	<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARCHER</b>:  Well, I'm very -- very empathetic 
to your comments.  <p> 
 
		I've been concerned over the years about withholding on 
the income tax, in effect making the income tax invisible to most 
workers who only think in terms of their net pay, rather than 
what their real salary is.  So, I subscribe to your concerns.<p> 
 
		There are any number of ways you can tax goods and 
services.  You can make it highly visible, or you can make it to 
where it's just built in, embedded in the price of the product.<p> 
 
		I think, however -- and this is only my opinion, 
because we've never tried this -- that it will not be so easy to 
raise any kind of a consumption tax politically if, in fact, it 
is the major, if not the sole, source of raising revenue for the 
federal Treasury.<p> 
 
		I have watched debate after debate --and Jack has been 
through some of these himself when he was a Member of Congress -- 
where there have been proposals to raise the gasoline tax by a 
few pennies.  <p> 
 
		And my view is, is that's hidden in the price of the 
product.  Very few people know when they go to the pump that 
they're paying 39 or 40 cents a gallon in taxes.  They simply see 
the price that's posted up there on the marquee sign.  <p> 
 
		And yet every time that there has been a proposal to 
raise the gas tax by even a few pennies, it is as if the sky was 
falling on everybody over in the House of Representatives.  		
The opposition was so emotional, so intense, that I 
personally think it would be very, very hard, if you put in a tax 
on goods and services, to simply raise it in order to fund a 
larger government.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER FEULNER</b>:  Particularly with the VAT 
experience in Europe with the tax.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARCHER</b>:  Well, but you've got to remember 
that's an add-on to the income tax.  And that puts it in entirely 
a different perspective than -- and I'm not here to defend a VAT.  
<p> 
 
		But I think we need to look as broadly as we can and 
recognize that if we do -- if we do completely remove the income 
tax, destroy it, pull it out by its roots, we will be the first 
major developed country in the history of the world to do that.<p> 
 
		And so we've got to understand that the whole chemistry 
changes.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Let me get to Governor Campbell.<p> 
 
		Carroll.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER CAMPBELL</b>:  Mr. Chairman, thank you very 
much.<p> 
 
		I certainly agree with your comments.  Let me ask you a 
couple of very quick questions.  		Number one, if you're 
going to pull the system out by its roots and really get the 
roots, how do you do it without a constitutional amendment? <p> 
 
		And number two, and I think -- and I'm in favor of it, 
I just wonder how we get to it if we're going to pull it all the 
way out by its roots.<p> 
 
		But, number two, in your comments you said that the 
system must have capital savings and must have incentives for 
savings.  But we wouldn't we look more at long-term savings for 
security and capital formation in a system like that?  Is that 
what you envisioned?<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARCHER</b>:  Oh, absolutely, because if you 
replace a tax on income with a tax on goods and services, you 
would have a zero tax on all of the money that is in everyone's 
paycheck and in what their businesses produce in the way of 
income.  <p> 
 
		And there would be complete and total discretion as to 
what part of those dollars would be spent on consumption and what 
part would be spent on savings.  It would be a zero tax on 
savings.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Let me --<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARCHER</b>:  Now, as far as the 16th Amendment 
is concerned, I would be a supporter of -- and I think there is a 
developing effort in the House right now to repeal the 16th 
Amendment.  And I would certainly support that effort.  <p> 
 
		But obviously, there are two ways to approach anything.  
One is by -- we found this on line-item veto.  I was the first 
person to introduce line-item veto legislation; and it was a 
constitutional amendment in the early '80s, when Reagan came to 
me and asked me to do it.  		We got what we call line item 
veto, but it's statutory -- and the House has already passed this 
year.  <p> 
 
		So, I think that we should move ahead with a simple 
majority and try to get rid of this income tax system.  <p> 
 
		And on a separate track, which I would support, we 
should make the long-term effort to repeal the 16th Amendment.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  I've just been informed that Senator 
Sam Nunn is on his way.  <p> 
 
		I want to get as many questions as possible, so I'll 
turn to Herman Cain.<p> 
 
		Herman.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER CAIN</b>:  Thank you, Jack.<p> 
 
		Thanks again, Mr. Archer, for being here.  <p> 
 
		There is no debate, as you indicated, over the fact 
that the current system needs to be thrown out.  And I believe 
that most of the members of this Commission share your goals and 
objectives for what we need to do.<p> 
 
		My question is, quite simply, how do we collectively 
ensure that our recommendations don't stop with the report or 
that what you want to do don't stop with the initiatives that 
you're undertaking?  	<p> 
 
		What do we have to collectively do to make sure that 
whatever is decided is able to actually become implemented?<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARCHER</b>:  Well, you're beginning that 
process right now.  These deliberations are being covered by the 
media.  They will be viewed or read by the people of this 
country.  I hope they will be prominently viewed and read by the 
people of this country.<p> 
 
		Every democracy obviously is pushed along by what is 
put into the minds of the electorate.  But even beyond that, you 
already were selected by the two leaders of the legislative 
branch of this country that will take on the responsibility of 
seeing that we do something.  And I am totally committed to that, 
as you're well aware.  <p> 
 
		And this committee is the beginning point for all tax 
legislation under the Constitution of the United States.  And it 
will be done in this committee.  <p> 
 
		Now, beyond that, I can't say what's going to leverage 
the Senate, but clearly if -- when we get something out of this 
committee, that's going to put tremendous pressure on the Senate 
and also tremendous pressure on the White House.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Ken Blackwell.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER BLACKWELL</b>:  Thank you, <p> 
 
Mr. Chairman.<p> 
 
		Chairman Archer, no industrial country has completely 
jettisoned the income tax system.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARCHER</b>:  Yes.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER BLACKWELL</b>:  So, whether we move from 
income tax -- pulling it up by its roots to a sales tax or the 
present system to a flat tax, or the present system to a more 
simplified system, what are your thoughts on the problems of 
transition?  What do you see as the primary transition problems?<p> 
 
		And an addendum to that question is:  What is your 
thought on this concept of neutrality, revenue, that any change 
in the system is revenue neutral?<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARCHER</b>:  Well, to take the last question 
first, I think we should have a revenue neutral change in the Tax 
Code.  I don't think, number one, it should produce any more 
revenue to give us a larger government.  <p> 
 
		And, number two, if it produces less, then we will, at 
a time when we have committed to get to a balanced budget, we 
will then, in effect, be making that challenge more difficult.<p> 
 
		So, I think we should shoot for revenue neutrality.  <p> 
 
		And obviously part of the difficulty is how we estimate 
it and who's doing the estimating, but that should be as 
objective as possible and as accurate as possible.  <p> 
 
		And we're continuing to refine the model for doing 
estimates and not simply taking the status quo.  And I think we 
can have more confidence as we move along in the estimating 
models.  <p> 
 
		But relative to -- let's see, what was the first part 
again?<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER CAIN</b>:  Transition.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARCHER</b>:  What?<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER CAIN</b>:  Issues of transition.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARCHER</b>:  Transition is always a problem.  
Transition was a problem in '86, even though we kept the 
graduated income tax.  And I don't belittle that.  We've just got 
to give a lot of thought as we move along to the various aspects 
of transition, and we won't solve all of the problems.  <p> 
 
		But I would suggest that as the American people look at 
your deliberations and our deliberations, that we catalogue and 
list the advantages and disadvantages of the current system 
compared to the advantages and disadvantages of the replacement.  <p> 
 
		We will not have a perfect replacement.  We will not 
have perfect transition.  But we do need to be assured that, as 
we make this great move, that the transition is done thoughtfully 
and that we don't have major economic dislocations as a result of 
it.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  From the state treasurer of Ohio to the 
state treasurer of the state of California, Matt Fong.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER FONG</b>:  Good morning, Chairman Archer.<p> 
 
		I'd like to just expound the question developed by 
Governor Campbell and Treasurer Blackwell dealing with the 16th 
Amendment.  <p> 
 
		I don't fully understand your answer -- or your 
explanation, I should say, on this two-track approach.  <p> 
 
		I'm concerned about, if we move from an income-based 
system to a goods-and-ervices system, that we don't end up with 
an income system and a goods-and-services that it fully replaces.  
<p> 
 
		And without repealing the 16th Amendment head on, I 
don't understand how we can guarantee that we don't have a 
multiple system like they do in Europe.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARCHER</b>:  I share your concerns.  I will not 
preside over a double system, which is the worst of all worlds.<p> 
 
		I guess if you're looking for guarantees, you shouldn't 
live in a democracy, that with total certainty you can say this 
will never happen.  There are no such things in a democracy.  <p> 
 
		You can make it tougher for certain things to happen.  
But I'm not here to tell you that I have got an all-perfect 
guarantee to all things, because ultimately the people will 
decide.  <p> 
 
		And it's my belief that the people have had enough of 
the income tax, that it will not grow back for many generations 
once we get rid of it, whether we repeal the 16th Amendment or 
not.  Although I think it would be very nice if we could repeal 
the 16th Amendment.  <p> 
 
		But I don't think we should sit back and say, "Oh, but 
wait, something -- we don't want to do this.  It's going to be so 
much better.  But we don't want to do it, because we don't have 
perfection."<p> 
 
		I will simply say this to you, because you're going to 
basically be looking at, I think, three alternatives -- and maybe 
you're creative enough to where you think of four or five or six.  
<p> 
 
		But there are three basic ones that I think are going 
to be out there.<p> 
 
		One is a tax on goods and services, and that has 
multiple methods of accomplishment.  <p> 
 
		The other one is a flat income tax.<p> 
 
		And the third one is some sort of a consumed income 
tax, such as the Nunn-Domenici approach.<p> 
 
		Now, I will simply say to you, without trying to -- 
well, I have my own ideas, obviously, and my own biases, having 
been through reform after reform in this committee.  		And I 
was for a flat tax in 1985-86.  And I was very disappointed that 
Reagan did not put in a -- recommend a true flat tax.  <p> 
 
		But I was focusing internally then on our domestic 
economy.  And I realize now that we have got to reach out and 
focus externally into a worldwide marketplace, which means I 
think we need a different tax system.<p> 
 
		But if you want guarantees, let me simply say to you 
that you shouldn't go to a flat tax without a 16th Amendment 
repeal, because history teaches us that the flat tax leaves the 
roots in the ground for sure and that the tree will grow again.  <p> 
 
		We moved toward a flat tax in 1986.  We didn't get 
there.  But by 1990, the sprouts were already out again.  And by 
'93, the tree was fully grown again.  <p> 
 
		So, if you want to look empirically at history, you 
will see the tree grow very shortly with a flat tax -- in my 
opinion.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER FONG</b>:  Mr. Chairman, you said, in 
advocating a tax on goods and services, there are multiple 
sources or ways to do it.  <p> 
 
		I'm thinking of -- most states have a sales tax --<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARCHER</b>:  Yes.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER FONG</b>:  -- it seems to me.  And there has 
been the idea in the past that that has been preserved for the 
states.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARCHER</b>:  Yes.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER FONG</b>:  The federal government doesn't get 
into that.  <p> 
 
		Governors are very important people and have a lot of 
influence in thinking about the politics of this.  <p> 
 
		Do you see a move by the federal government into that 
type of taxation, as preempting an area that has been reserved to 
the states?  <p> 
 
		And is it a problem that has -- that can be overcome, 
or is it not even a legitimate concern?<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARCHER</b>:  Well, you certainly are going to 
hear that.  And we will hear it.  <p> 
 
		And governors and legislatures will say, "Well, wait a 
minute.  This is going to change our method of operating or 
impact in some way or another on our method of operating."<p> 
 
		I think we have to remember that the states are the 
total receptacle of power for taxation.  The federal government 
has, from the beginning, been, to a degree, limited.  The states 
have complete and total power of taxation under our Constitution.  
<p> 
 
		And the states have the flexibility to adjust and to 
find the best method to raise their revenue, regardless of what 
the federal government does.<p> 
 
		And I don't think it's an automatic barrier once 
governors and legislatures understand the benefits that could 
come if, in fact, you select and believe that a national sales 
tax is the way to go.<p> 
 
		I have not, as I said, yet settled on the vehicle.  I'm 
waiting for you to tell me what you think is the best of the many 
ways to raise taxes -- to put the tax burden on goods and 
services.<p> 
 
		And actually, I will be looking forward to your 
recommendations.  I have other task forces and other people that 
are work evaluating the various methods of going about doing 
this.  		I think the benefits in the end are so beneficial, 
economically, both to the individual, as I mentioned, in the form 
of freedom, total freedom from the IRS, and, secondly, to 
economic development and job creation and productivity.<p> 
 
		America -- if we begin to tax goods and services, 
America will become the sponge for capital savings for the entire 
world.  We will drink up capital savings, and not just 
domestically but from around the world.<p> 
 
		A friend of mine was talking to a Japanese CEO a month 
ago.  And he said, "If America does what is being proposed by <p> 
 
Bill Archer, we will move our international headquarters to the 
United States of America."<p> 
 
		I mean, there are going to be dramatic -- interest 
rates will decline dramatically because money, as we all know it, 
is a fungible product.  <p> 
 
		And there is a free market on money.  It has a price, 
and that price is interest rates.  And when America becomes a 
sponge for capital, interest rates will decline dramatically.<p> 
 
		So, I didn't mean to get into all of this lengthy 
response.  But I think when people begin to understand the 
benefits that can come from this, I believe we can overcome some 
of the political reluctance.  <p> 
 
		There will be -- change is always resisted by people 
who want to believe things are just going to go along the way 
they've always gone.  <p> 
 
		We've got a new breed of governors now -- and Carroll 
Campbell sort of launched that effort some years ago, in putting 
new types of governors into place that are creative.  They're not 
locked into the old mold.<p> 
 
		And I would hope that if we do our sales job right, 
that if, in fact, the sales tax -- national sales tax -- is 
considered the best way to go, that we will be able to handle 
that.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Jack Faris.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER FARIS</b>:  Mr. Chairman, one definition of 
"courage" I've heard is living out daily what one professes to 
believe.  <p> 
 
		And if that's an accurate definition, you epitomize 
that in the courage you're taking to take on the whole tax system 
of the <p> 
 
United States.  We applaud you for that.<p> 
 
		As you well know from your deliberations and 
information, that the majority of small business owners pay a lot 
more money in payroll tax than they --  <p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER FARIS</b>:  -- do in income tax.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARCHER</b>:  Yes.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER FARIS</b>:  And as much as we applaud -- and 
that roar you hear may be from a small business community on Main 
Street when you said, "Take the IRS and close it down."<p> 
 
		But my question then is:  Do you address payroll taxes 
as a part of your approach?<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARCHER</b>:  I have not at this point committed 
to replace the payroll taxes.  But I think we should look at 
that.  I think we should look, as I said earlier, very broadly, 
very boldly.  <p> 
 
		And there is no question but the payroll taxes are some 
of the more aggressive taxes in this country, as well as some of 
the biggest job deterrents that we have on the books.<p> 
 
		And I have resisted increases in the payroll taxes 
during my entire political career because of that. <p> 
 
		You do take on an added burden.  <p> 
 
		Many people will say, "Oh, well, this is in some way 
going to impact on Social Security."  <p> 
 
		And I think we've got to be very, very careful that we 
let the American public realize that if we do let this new form 
of taxation replace the payroll tax, too, that we will still 
comply with the benefit structure of Social Security and that 
funding would then be transferred from the general Treasury into 
the Social Security fund out of the revenues raised from this 
other form of taxation.<p> 
 
		But I would encourage you to think boldly in your 
recommendations.  And if you come to the conclusion that you 
think it should replace the payroll tax, too, then that's what 
you're here for, to make that recommendation.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER FARIS</b>:  Thank you.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  John Wieland, outstanding homebuilder 
from Atlanta, Georgia.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER WIELAND</b>:  Mr. Chairman, you -- it's just 
wonderful to start the hearings this way, in this place and with 
you.<p> 
 
		I think, you know, clearly, the American public wants 
change, but often it seems to me that the American public doesn't 
want to confront the unknown.  <p> 
 
		And I wonder if you would have some suggestions for us 
as to how we might best build consensus with the American public?<p> 
 <b>
		CONGRESSMAN ARCHER</b>:  Well, I think it's going to take 
effort on the part of a lot of us.  I hope that I have launched 
that the day after the election, when I held a press conference 
in this room and stunned everybody by saying, then, that I wanted 
to do away with the income tax.<p> 
 
		I think at that time an awful lot of<p> 
 
people thought it was extremely radical.  But I think more and 
more people now understand that it is not radical, but it is 
major change.  And there is always resistance to major change.<p> 
 
		You people come from various walks of life, and you 
have other members of your panel who are not here today who will 
be participating.  And you have broad influence in our country.  <p> 
 
		And I think that you, yourselves, could well benefit by 
having someone who would set up a method by which your message 
gets across within your own operation that would be very much 
creative in how you get your message across.  <p> 
 
		It might be -- I don't know how much time you're 
willing to spend on this.  As I said, you're volunteers.  I guess 
you're not being paid for this.  You're volunteers.  <p> 
 
		And you've got busy lives in many other ways.  But it 
seems to me that you could take your show on the road around this 
country.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER WIELAND</b>:  We're going to.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARCHER</b>:  There are any number of ways that 
you can attempt to get your message across that will bolster what 
we're trying to do here.<p> 
 
		In the end, I can see Jack on <b>Meet the Press</b> and on 
<b>This Week with Brinkley</b> and on <b>Face the Nation</b>  when you reach 
your conclusions.  There are any number of ways that we're going 
to be able to get this message across.  But it <p> 
 
is --<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  I'm too shy to do those shows.<p> 
 
		(Laughter)<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARCHER</b>:  What?<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  I'm too shy to do those shows.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARCHER</b>:  Yeah -- oh.<p> 
 
		(Laughter)<p> 
 
		But -- and I didn't mean to select those to --<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Right.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARCHER</b>:  -- to eliminate others -- 
<b>McNeil/Lehrer</b> and all the others.  <p> 
 
		But we do have build consensus.  And the first thing we 
have to do is build a consensus within our majority in the 
Congress.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Right.<p> 
 
		Well, what we're trying to do is inventory the problems 
which you have addressed yourself to quite eloquently, Bill -- 
inventory the solutions.  And we hope you'll come back --<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARCHER</b>:  I will.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  -- in perhaps the early fall and talk 
about the Archer bill.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARCHER</b>:  I will.  I will.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Senators Nunn and Domenici are both on 
their way, I've just been informed.  <p> 
 
		But let me take a question and prerogative of the 
Chair.<p> 
 
		You did mention, in passing, that four members of our 
Commission could not be here, all of whom were appointed by the 
Speaker and the Majority Leader of the Senate, Bob Dole.<p> 
 
		Loretta Adams is an entrepreneur -- an impresario, an 
Hispanic businesswoman from <p> 
 
San Diego.<p> 
 
		Governor du Pont, an old buddy of yours, is Carroll's 
counterpart.<p> 
 
		And Teddy Forstmann, of Forstmann, Little, one of our 
Nation's outstanding entrepreneurs and financiers.<p> 
 
		And John Snow, chairman of CSX. <p> 
 
		In my opening comment, I quoted President Kennedy, who 
said, in '62, that the paradox of tax reform is that many times 
high rates cause less revenue.  <p> 
 
		And setting the rates at a level of equilibrium at 
which people are willing to maximize their output and still pay 
tax in a peacetime economy is really going to take a Solomon-like 
decision.  Albeit in a democracy, there will be give and take.<p> 
 
		One of the questions I have for you, Mr. Chairman, is, 
if a principle --<p> 
 
		(End tape 1, side 1)<p> 
 
		-- for a government's legitimate purposes, a corollary 
to that, or secondary to that principle, is upon whom should the 
burden of that tax be placed?<p> 
 
		I don't think there's any -- I watched you and Charlie 
Rangel go toe to toe.  And he's a friend of yours and a good 
friend of mine.  		And he kept bringing up the issue -- I'm 
not speaking for him, but it's an issue that all of us have to 
address in this debate, "fairness."<p> 
 
		We wouldn't tax a teenager who's starting out in life.  
We wouldn't tax an apprentice starting his or her first rung of 
the ladder that we euphemistically call <i>the American Dream</i>, but 
you reminded us today is a "universal" dream.  <p> 
 
		How do we adjust the Code -- i.e., the rate -- so that 
the burden falls on those most able to pay, but in such a way as 
it does not reduce their ability to save, invest, and work, and 
take that risk that is so important to the creation of wealth?<p> 
 
		As a principle, what is in your mind about making sure 
that the weakest elements of our society -- the woman coming off 
of welfare, taking her first job -- how do you make sure that a 
sales tax, if it is a consumption tax, is not placed in such a 
way as those with the least amount of disposable income in our 
society are paying too heavy a burden?<p> 
 
		I don't say that to argue.  I say that to raise issues 
--<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARCHER</b>:  No, I understand.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  -- that I know are going to be raised 
by our colleagues in this great democratic -- small "d" -- 
debate.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARCHER</b>:  Well -- and we must be prepared to 
come to grips with that issue.  That is a very, very big issue.  
And it's one that we struggle with here, in the Congress, over 
and over and over again.  <p> 
 
		It, in a sense, is one of the big conundrums as to how 
we tax; because on the one hand. we say those who are able to pay 
the most should pay the most.  And I don't think people will 
argue with that.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Right.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARCHER</b>:  But what is "the most"?  <p> 
 
		And what is the relative incline in taking assets away 
from those who are in a position to create jobs?<p> 
 
		It takes, today, $280,000 per job of invested capital 
in the United States.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  How much?<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARCHER</b>:  $280,000.<p> 
 
		Now, Jack, your members probably would not spend that 
much in small businesses, but that's the average across the 
board.<p> 
 
		Now, $280,000, in the minds of those who want to tax 
wealth, is a large amount of money.  <p> 
 
		So, if you adopt the concept that we have got to take a 
big chunk away from someone who has $280,000 to invest, you're in 
effect destroying jobs.<p> 
 
		So the conundrum is:  How do you continue the savings 
and invested capital to create the better-paying job, to increase 
real family income in the paychecks, and at the same time say, 
"Well, we're really going to hit those people"?  <p> 
 
		And we have never found a valid answer to that over the 
years, I don't think, in this country.  <p> 
 
		But the one thing that we do know is no matter how we 
manipulated the Code by those who would socially engineer it, we 
have not changed the basic percentage of ownership of wealth in 
this country.  We have not succeeded in redistributing wealth.  <p> 
 
		It may sound good from a rhetorical standpoint on a 
political stump, but the reality is that it has not worked.<p> 
 
		But one interesting thing, which you know better than 
anybody else, is when the rates were reduced in 1986 -- and that 
was the benefit of the '86 Act, in spite of all of the bad parts 
of it -- the people in the very highest income effectively paid 
more, with a lower rate, of the percentage of the money that came 
in to fund the federal government. <p> 
 
		Now, that doesn't fit within the political rhetoric of 
those who always want to sic the poor against the rich and the 
rich against the poor, in creating economic class struggles in 
this country.<p> 
 
		But so long as we have a democracy with a free 
enterprise, capitalistic society, we're going to need people who 
have wealth to create jobs.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Of course, that top <p> 
 
10 percent changes every 20 years.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARCHER</b>:  And that's true, too.  I mean, 
that's also true of these distribution tables on which all of our 
proposals are judged, that what does this do for this income 
class, acts as if people stay in that income class all of their 
lives, and they don't.  <p> 
 
		We know the studies show that Americans are moving up 
and down the ladder every year, and that's the secret in this 
country.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Do you have a minute or two to take a 
couple more questions?<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARCHER</b>:  Yes, if you've got a minute or two 
to listen to long answers.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Well, Nunn and Domenici are on their 
way. <p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARCHER</b>:  Okay.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  They were on the floor of the Senate 
when I got word that they were walking over.  So. I'll let them. <p> 
 
		Raise your hands if you have -- <p> 
 
		Governor Campbell -- Carroll.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER CAMPBELL</b>:  Thank you.<p> 
 
		Mr. Chairman, the issue of equity and fairness often is 
in the way it's explained.  <p> 
 
		If you had a 20 percent flat tax and you told somebody 
that "Somebody who made $200,000 is going to pay a $40,000 tax; 
and if you make $20,000, you're going to pay a $4,000.  Is that 
fair?" -- they'd probably all say, "Yeah, that's fair."<p> 
 
		Oftentimes it's not explained in, you know, exactly 
those terms.  And so when you look at the tax from a flat tax 
standpoint, then I think you could explain the equity of it.<p> 
 
		The other thing that I was very interested in -- and 
you kept going back to --was the creation of the capital base in 
the country, which we have to have, which has got to come from 
people's savings, long-term savings.  <p> 
 
		And I guess that comment let's me have a segue into 
what we're doing today to keep the government from growing back.  <p> 
 
		And I speak of the headlines in papers about baby 
boomers not preparing for the future, not ready for the future, 
and things like that <p> 
 
-- and as to whether we should address that as an incentive need.  
<p> 
 
		All of these things deal with the equity.  And the 
reason that one deals with equity is if they don't prepare, 
you're going to have to tax somebody else more to take care of 
them in the future.  <p> 
 
		And I think that's all part of what we're doing.  I 
don't mean to overstate that.  <p> 
 
		I guess the one thing that I wanted to ask you, from 
the consumption tax standpoint, you made the comment about states 
and the conflict, and that was raised.  There actually is, in the 
system today, another layer of that taxation.<p> 
 
		And one is simple.  You have a state sales tax.  Then, 
in many instances, you have a county sales tax.  And in many 
instances, you have a city sales tax or a tax on things.  <p> 
 
		So that tiered system is there at different levels of 
government.  I'm not so sure it would be as difficult as some 
have raised the specter of.  <p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARCHER</b>:  Well, I do think that the fairness 
and the regressivity concern is an important one.  And it has 
been raised by a couple of you, and I share that concern.  <p> 
 
		And I think when you do get into the very lower-income 
people -- first, let me say that if you put a tax on good and 
services, the Social Security recipient, the retired person who 
is living off their Social Security benefits, would immediately 
be made whole by <p> 
 
the COLA.  So, there would be no disadvantage to a retired person 
on Social Security.  <p> 
 
		If you are at the very bottom and you're on welfare, 
you would be made whole by an increase in your welfare benefits 
that would keep pace with the CPI.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Mm-hmm.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARCHER</b>:  Now, the question though, then, is 
when you get above the threshold of being on welfare and you're 
in a lower income category as a worker, I think we do have to be 
concerned about some credit rebate or waiver system that would 
not punish those people.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Bill, you've really done us a great 
service.<p>

<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR NUNN</b>:  I congratulate you on taking this job, 
because I don't know of any job that's more challenging, but also 
has more potential for really accomplishing something for 
American people and the future income and economic growth of our 
country.<p> 
 
		Mr. Chairman, you're right.  You and I started in the 
tax business together about the same time.  You were out in front 
of me, I think, you and Bill Roth.  And then I came trailing in 
about 1978.  But I've been involved a long time.  		<p> 
 
		And I never will forget when we passed a resolution in 
the Senate urging the Finance Committee and the Ways and Means 
Committee to basically -- well, actually, we passed the bill in 
the Senate called the "Nunn-Chiles bill" and you passed a 
resolution.  <p> 
 
		You came back on a flight and passed a resolution in 
the House to urge the House conferees to accept it, which had 
already passed the Senate two-thirds.  Your vote passed by <p> 
 
two-thirds.  Lo and behold, the Conference kicked the whole thing 
out and put in some language. <p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Right.<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR NUNN</b>:  That was about 1978.  And I always 
contended to President Carter -- at that time President Carter -- 
that had the administration supported it at that time, the 1980 
election might have been different, because that was a 
fundamental point in our history.  But I wanted to --<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>: I will resist a comment on that.<p> 
 
		(Laughter)<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR NUNN</b>:  I don't think he agreed either.   <p> 
 
		But, Mr. Chairman, Senator Domenici is coming in just a 
few minutes.  And I thought I'd lead off just with a few informal 
remarks.  I would like to have had a statement prepared, but I've 
been caught between the Defense markup -- in fact, we're meeting 
now.  So, I'm going to make my remarks brief.  <p> 
 
		And then Senator Domenici will probably come in, in the 
middle.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Okay.<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR NUNN</b>:  We just had a vote on a securities 
matter.<p> 
 
		The fundamental point of economic policy, we believe -- 
Senator Domenici and I, and I think we see this alike -- is to 
promote the long-term growth and a higher standing of living in 
the American people.<p> 
 
		Now, the growth and higher standard of living of our 
country depend on productivity, depend on our people being more 
productive.  And that increased productivity depends on increased 
investment.  <p> 
 
		And increased investment depends on fundamental 
savings.  And that is the heart of what we're talking about.  And 
we believe that's the heart of what's wrong with our Tax Code 
today.  <p> 
 
		Because without savings, you don't get investment.  
Without investment, you don't get productivity.  And without 
productivity, you do not get the kind of increases in our 
standard of living and economic growth that we all, I think, 
desire.<p> 
 
		The bottom line is that savings relates directly to 
jobs, and higher-paying jobs, because it all goes together.  <p> 
 
		So, what we set out to do was to address that 
fundamental problem that affects our economic growth and also the 
pay of the American worker.<p> 
 
		The U.S. national savings rate is very low, as we all 
know.  That trend started in the 1970s, but continues to this 
day.  <p> 
 
		We've had about 20 years of much lower savings.  And it 
is demonstrated very vividly in all the charts on investment and 
certainly those charts where we're compared to Japan, but not 
just Japan.  Almost any country in the world, or any industrial 
country is out-saving us and out-investing us.<p> 
 
		And, of course, the economists tell us that national 
investment equals national savings, plus, of course, imported 
capital.  And we've gotten our investment primarily because we 
have imported capital over the last two decades.<p> 
 
		Now, the question is:  Why do we have such low savings?  
<p> 
 
		I don't sit here before this tax panel and try to 
contend that it's all related to the Tax Code.  I think that's a 
fundamental part of it, but it's also cultural, and it also 
relates to the overall budget deficit.  <p> 
 
		We're trying to address that budget deficit, but it 
fundamentally cuts into our savings, our net savings as a Nation.<p> 
 
		The Tax Code today, Mr. Chairman -- and you ask, in the 
letter:  What's wrong with our current Code?  <p> 
 
		And, of course, if the American people come to the 
conclusion that we do need to change the Tax Code, it will be 
because they believe there are fundamental problems with it. <p> 
 
		So, what's wrong with our Tax Code today?<p> 
 
		Senator Domenici and I believe that the fundamental 
problem with our Tax Code is that it taxes savers twice and it 
taxes investors twice.  It taxes consumers once.<p> 
 
		So, naturally the laws of economics and incentives mean 
that if you are taxed twice if you save, but once if you consume, 
there is more incentive to consume than to save. <p> 
 
		We're trying to level the playing field.  We're trying 
to say that savers are basically not penalized, that there's no 
bias against savings in the Tax Code.  That was our fundamental 
goal.<p> 
 
		The corporate level also demonstrates that, in effect, 
corporate earnings are taxed twice.  They're taxed once at the 
company level; and when they're distributed as dividends, they're 
taxed again.<p> 
 
		And, of course, if the corporate rate is higher than 
the individual rate, people in lower brackets who are investors 
are taxed at a higher rate at the corporate level than they would 
be taxed if the money was distributed directly to them to begin 
with.<p> 
 
		So, both the business side and the individual side we 
believe are biased against people who save.<p> 
 
		We have a number of goals.  But when we get down to the 
question of what is the effect of savings, I think it has been 
said many times in many different reports.<p> 
 
		The most recent one I've read -- <p> 
 
Martin Feldstein had an editorial in the <b>Economist</b> magazine last 
week that said "Save and Prosper."   <p> 
 
		In fact, high-savings countries have high rates of 
investment, whereas low-savings countries have low rates of 
investment.<p> 
 
		Lots of people have said pretty much the same thing.  
And I think the evidence is pretty overwhelming.  <p> 
 
		So, our goals were several.  <p> 
 
		The first -- the first goal was that we believe that 
any tax system should be designed, as far as possible, to finance 
the real needs of government with the least damage to economic 
growth.  <p> 
 
		I suppose it's hard to find any tax that promotes 
economic growth.  Some are worse than others.  And what we think 
we ought to try to do is design a tax system that does the least 
harm to economic growth.<p> 
 
		A second goal was to remove the bias against savers -- 
I've already alluded to that <p> 
 
-- allowing savings and investment to move to the place where 
they make the most sense, as dictated by the market and by free 
decisions of free people.                                  <p> 
 
		The third goal is to reduce the complexity of the Tax 
Code.  And that means to have understandable principles.  This 
reducing complexity has been the goal of almost every tax reform 
movement that I know anything about.  It never seems to happen.  <p> 
 
		But at the very least, we ought to make the principles 
of the Tax Code understandable, and we ought to strive for 
simplicity.	<p> 
 
		I don't think we ought to strive so much for simplicity 
that we ignore economic effect and that we ignore the basic 
fairness element.  But I do think simplicity ought to be a 
fundamental part of the goal.<p> 
 
		The fourth goal that we had in our proposal was to try 
modernize the American tax system based on the competitive 
reality of the world.  We don't have a level playing field now.  		We actually have a tax system that 
puts us at a 
disadvantage vis-a-vis the Europeans and Japanese and other 
competitors.  In effect, they have a value-added tax to finance a 
great portion of their government.  So, goods in their country 
that are exported, they get a rebate.  They are not taxed, 
basically.<p> 
 
		Our goods carry with them abroad the tax system of our 
country and the tax rates of our country.  <p> 
 
		On the other hand, when we ship good to Europe or 
Japan, those goods are taxed with their value added.  Now, when 
they ship goods here, they don't have a similar tax.<p> 
 
		So, we're trying to level the playing field 
competitively.  That's another very important goal.  <p> 
 
		The way we address that -- and there may be other ways 
-- but we found this one to be the most satisfying, at least from 
our perspective -- is that our tax is territorial.  It applies to 
all sales on U.S. soil, no matter where the business is 
headquartered.  <p> 
 
		If you're headquartered in New York or you're 
headquartered in California or you're headquartered in Georgia, 
your goods that are sold in the American market under our 
proposal would be taxed at the same rate as goods that are made 
in England or Germany or France or Mexico or South Korea that are 
imported into this country.<p> 
 
		So, we have a territorial tax.  It is border 
adjustable.  And that would put us on the same level playing 
field with Japan and Europe and others.  <p> 
 
		That is to say if an American company is located in 
Europe and sells outside the United States, they would not be 
taxed.  We'd get rid of a huge amount of complexity if the sales 
are outside the United States or a subsidiary.  <p> 
 
		On the other hand, if they are located in another 
country, Mexico or anywhere else, and they are producing there 
and shipping back into this country, their goods are taxed 
exactly as if they were made in the United States, and we would 
indeed have a level playing field.<p> 
 
		Some of our trading partners may raise a complaint 
about this.  We believe it's <p> 
 
GATT-compliant.  We've structured it to be <p> 
 
GATT- compliant.  We think that's important.<p> 
 
		But nevertheless, we think that a level playing field, 
in this day of competition and international competition, is 
essential for the American businesses.<p> 
 
		The final goal that I will mention this morning is that 
it be perceived as fair.  <p> 
 
		I think a tax system can be defined as working if it 
promotes economic growth and raises a standard of living to the 
American people.  But if it's going to endure, it's going to have 
to be fair.  <p> 
 
		You can pass a bill, might even get it signed into law, 
but it will not last if the American people come to the 
conclusion that it is not fair.  <p> 
 
		That's the hard part.  It's hard to blend fairness and 
simplicity.  Those two sometimes work apart.<p> 
 
		The way we tried to approach the fairness issue, we 
kept progress rates.  I know there'll be disagreement on that.  <p> 
 
		You could take our system and you could make flat rates 
of it if you wanted.  We believe that progress rates, though, in 
this system, where savings are fundamentally deducted, where you 
deduct your savings, you deduct your investment before you pay 
your tax, the marginal rate takes on a totally different nature 
than the marginal rate now, where you have not been able to 
deduct savings.<p> 
 
		So, we kept progressive rates, but we fundamentally, we 
think, changed the equation on the effect of those progressive 
rates on investment and on savings.<p> 
 
		We also have a family living allowance which does not 
exist under the current Tax Code.  We kept the standard 
deduction, so you get an extra standard -- you get an extra 
family living allowance, recognizing that low-income people are 
not going to be able as much as <p> 
 
higher-income people.  That's just a fact of life.<p> 
 
		We strengthened the earned-income tax credit.  We 
increased that so that we make it more enticing and give more 
incentive for people to work, rather than the other way around.  <p> 
 
		There would be a larger earned income tax credit.  We 
know there are some problems in administering that, and we don't 
ignore those, but we think that, still, that principle is 
absolutely essential.<p> 
 
		And then, finally -- and I'll close with this, Mr. 
Chairman -- we believe the most regressive part of our current 
Tax Code is the FICA tax, the employee and employer Social 
Security and Medicare tax.  <p> 
 
		In effect, it's regressive because it cuts off -- most 
of it cuts off at $60,000.  Low-income people pay a higher 
proportion of their income for FICA taxes than higher-income 
people.  It also is a tax on jobs.  <p> 
 
		We know if you want to get rid of anything, you tax it 
enough.  Well, we've got a big tax on jobs in this country.  And 
I think that is one of the biggest impediments that <p> 
 
low-income and low-skilled American people face is that FICA tax 
that every employer looks at before they hire someone.  They're 
talking about another 14 percent.<p> 
 
		So, what we do is we calibrate our rates so that the 
employee gets a full credit back against their income tax -- not 
a deduction, but a credit back against their income tax, dollar 
for dollar, for the FICA taxes paid.  The same thing for the 
employer.  <p> 
 
		We believe that feature should be incorporated in any 
tax code that you come up with.<p> 
 
		I know you want to have some dialogue.  I don't know 
whether my colleague, <p> 
 
Senator Domenici, is here or not.  But I will just close with 
those very scattered remarks and invite your comments and 
questions.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Well, Senator, thank you very much for 
that eloquent testimony. <p> 
 
		I'd like to take the prerogative of the Chair and turn 
it over, for the first question, to your constituent, John 
Wieland of Atlanta Georgia, one of our Nation's most productive 
homebuilders.  <p> 
 
		And, John, take it away.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER WIELAND</b>:  It has been suggested that a 
fundamental change in the income tax might not last for long, 
that the income tax after that change is going to continue to 
grow back to perhaps what we know it today.<p> 
 
		How can you -- how can we be sure that we made a tax 
and kept an income tax, that that wouldn't happen?<p> 
 
		<b>PARTICIPANT</b>:  That it would not simply be repealed, is 
that what you --<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER WIELAND;</b>  Yes.  And it wouldn't grow back, 
you know, in an effort raise taxes, whatever the White House 
thinks is appropriate.<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR NUNN</b>:  Well, I believe that's one of the 
problems and challenges with a flat tax, because if you get rid 
of all the deductions with a flat tax and then get the rate down 
in exchange for that -- we have only to look at the Act of '86.  <p> 
 
		What happens is the rates start going back up, but you 
still don't get your deductions back.  I think that's a real a 
problem.<p> 
 
		We kept what we considered to be the essential 
deductions that we believe the American people want and will 
demand over a period of time.  <p> 
 
		We kept the deduction for home mortgages, and we kept 
the deduction for charities in our proposal.  <p> 
 
		We do eliminate a number of other deductions.  You can 
eliminate any number of deductions -- current deductions you'd 
like in a Code and you can lower the rate to do that.  <p> 
 
		But if you do that one time and you get rid of all of 
them and then people come back and raise the rate, then you have 
a real disincentive. <p> 
 
		We believe that once you put in law that savings and 
investment are deducted at the individual level, that that 
deduction will remain.  We believe that will be so clearly 
understood and will be such a driving force in the economy, that 
that one will not be subject to change.<p> 
 
		A future Congress might decide they want a higher rate.  
But if you keep the basic premise that a person that takes $100 
and puts it in a bank account or $1,000, they get to deduct that 
before they pay their taxes, I believe there would be strong 
support for that one that it would not change, because it would 
be perceived to allow people to be building for their future.<p> 
 
		The other thing that I think is so important here -- as 
we reform the entitlement programs, we all know, as we sit here, 
there is no way in the world we're going to be able to keep the 
Social Security system the way it is today for people who are now 
20, 30, 40 years old.  <p> 
 
		We can protect those who are already retired, and we 
should, or those who are about to retire.  But the people in 
their 20s and 30s and 40s are going to have to retire at a higher 
age.  I don't think there's any doubt about that.<p> 
 
		We believe that tax reform goes with entitlement 
reform, because people are going to have to be -- and younger 
people particularly are going to have to be given an ability to 
save money over a period of time so they can augment the 
retirement programs that will hopefully still exist when they get 
there.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Dean Kleckner, on the far left.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER KLECKNER</b>:  Senator, it seems to me that 
the debate, as we go on through the year, will center on tax 
change or tax reforms that focus on social policy, on fear of the 
government -- fear of the tax collection process itself, IRS, and 
economics -- with economics probably ending up third in that 
triumvirate, where it should be first.<p> 
 
		What -- and I like -- I agree with many things you said 
here.  I like the thrust that you and Senator Domenici are 
talking about.  <p> 
 
		But what can we do?  What advice do you have for us -- 
because we're going to be talking not only back to you, but to 
the American people -- to bring economics more to the forefront 
and get away from the social agenda, which you can't ever 
eliminate, and the fear of the government, fear of the IRS, which 
I think is rising -- the fear of the government is rising amongst 
the American people.  <p> 
 
		What do we do, what do we focus on to bring it to the 
economic agenda? <p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR NUNN</b>:  That's a tough question. and I wouldn't 
presume to be able to give you a complete answer on that.  <p> 
 
		I would say that I believe we have a Tax Code that is 
so complex today that the people who are administering it in the 
IRS don't understand it themselves.  <p> 
 
		And if they don't understand it, the average person out 
there on the firing line in the IRS -- or at least if there are 
fundamental features they don't understand, then the way they 
administer it is going to be perceived by the people that they're 
dealing with, the public, as being both ill-informed and unfair.  
And I think there's a growing sense of that.<p> 
 
		So, I believe the Congress of the United States and 
this Commission will be making recommendations to the Congress of 
the <p> 
 
United States and to the President -- next President.  <p> 
 
		I believe that you have a real opportunity here to try 
to come up with some clarity; because if the IRS can't understand 
it, no one else can.  <p> 
 
		And I think that it's really almost unfair to the 
Internal Revenue Service agents out there.  Far be it from me to 
defend them.  I know that's not politically correct to defend the 
IRS, and I'm not going to do it here today.  		But I 
would say that they, themselves. will tell you, when you talk to 
them privately, there's lots of this Code that they can't 
understand themselves, or that it's so complex they're not 
capable of explaining it to people.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Jack Faris, an old friend of yours, of 
NFIB.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER FARIS</b>:  Senator, we thank you for your 
leadership.  You've been working on this for a while, as you 
mentioned earlier, and we thank you for that.<p> 
 
		Yet, one of the things that concerns the small business 
owners around the country is: "I'm spending my life building into 
a business and building a company and building a reputation, 
taking less out and putting more in, to build something for my 
family."  The whole area of inheritance and the state taxes.<p> 
 
		We hope we'll save the family farm, ranch, and 
business, and the jobs located in those businesses.  <p> 
 
		Does your proposal include the elimination of those 
inheritance taxes or exempts the smaller, privately owned company 
to be able to be passed down to the family and employees?<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR NUNN</b>:  Our proposal does not touch anything but 
the income tax.  We don't pretend to have addressed the estate 
tax.  <p> 
 
		I personally, individually -- and I'm not speaking for 
the group that came up with this proposal or for Senator 
Domenici, but I believe he shares this.  <p> 
 
		I think if we keep our current Internal Revenue Code 
that we have now, we have to increase the estate tax exemption 
for small businesses.  I think it has to be updated.  So, I don't 
favor the present estate tax with the present Code.<p> 
 
		We have to be careful in this proposal, though, because 
in this proposal, if you take -- if you make $100,000 and you 
save 20 of that, that money is deferred.  Eventually you're going 
to pay taxes on it.  <p> 
 
		But if you keep that invested, you will never pay taxes 
on it.  And then you pass away, you die, and at that stage there 
has to be some incidence of taxation.  So, we would not abolish 
the estate tax.  <p> 
 
		I don't think abolishing the estate tax plus this 
deferred tax on savings and investment would go together.  I 
think that would be a conflict, because then you would have not 
just a deferral of tax, you would have tax that would never -- I 
mean, you'd have income that would never be taxed. <p> 
 
		So, under the current Code, I favor reforming the 
estate tax.  I hope we can make a fundamental reform, which would 
mean the estate tax could then be modernized based on the new 
system.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Matt Fong.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSION FONG</b>:  Senator Nunn, in the different 
consumption proposals, yours seems to -- your use of the tax 
initiative seems to have a degree of preference for the tax-exempt market that the others do not.  Can you 
explain your --<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR NUNN</b>:  For the -- for the what?<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER FONG</b>:  Tax-exempt market.<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR NUNN</b>:  Like municipals and --<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER FONG</b>:  Municipals, yes.	<p> 
 
		Can you explain your rationale for giving a preference 
for this, that the others have not done so?<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR NUNN</b>:  I haven't studied the other tax 
proposals on that feature.  But financing local government and 
state government is a key part of our overall responsibilities.  
We don't want to do something at the federal level that wrecks 
the local and state government ability to finance.<p> 
 
		Now, what we do, by letting you put money in a savings 
account, the earnings on -- and that's deductible -- we level the 
playing field somewhat with municipal and state bonds.  <p> 
 
		But we still give a preference to municipal and state 
bonds by saying that the income off of those -- let's say you get 
$5,000 a year off of your municipal bonds, that income, even if 
you consume it, would not be taxed. <p> 
 
		We believe under the Constitution and under our system 
of state government, local government, and federalism, that we 
should not do something at the federal level that's going to 
cripple the ability of state and local governments to raise 
money.<p> 
 
		And we think that preference would still be enticing to 
people for investment purposes.  In effect, people who invest in 
those bonds are paying taxes.  They're paying taxes by a lower 
rate.  They are, in effect, subsidizing state and local 
government by taking a rate that would be lower than they would 
otherwise receive.<p> 
 
		That's a hard concept to explain, but I think it's 
true.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER</b>:  Senator Nunn -- <p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Excuse me, waiting to testify and with 
a short time is our friend Dick Armey, the Majority leader of the 
House.<p> 
 
		So, if Pete Domenici cannot make it, Sam, when you 
finish, we will then have Dick Armey.  And I would ask that the 
questions be as brief as possible so we can get to Dick.<p> 
 
		Thank you.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER</b>:  Thank you very much for being here, 
Senator Nunn.	<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR NUNN</b>:  Thank you.	<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER</b>:  You explained your approach and how it 
leveled the global playing field.  <p> 
 
		One of my concerns is, with a major change, using 
either one of the approaches that's on the table, how do we 
adjust for the fact that a large percentage of the population 
will not be at the same starting point?<p> 
 
		You know, you've got some that are much further behind 
in this whole equation, and you start talking about incenting 
(sic) savings when you've got a group of people who are not even 
at the same starting point.  How does your approach address the 
inequity there?<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR NUNN</b>:  Well, as I mentioned, the FICA Tax 
rebate would make a huge difference for low-income people.  <p> 
 
		It would also make a big difference for small 
businesses that really need to expand but can't afford to add 
another 14 percent to the minimum wage, plus whatever they're 
paying.  <p> 
 
		So, those two features I think are important.<p> 
 
		We also keep the rates progressive, so that if someone 
for very -- we're not trying to tax wealth as long as wealth as 
long as wealth is working for jobs -- for all of us.<p> 
 
		But if I'm a borrower, and I don't save any money, but 
someone else is saving money, that person saving money helps me, 
because I'm going to be able to borrow at less interest rate than 
I otherwise would.  <p> 
 
		So, I think that concept is important.  		I 
would also say that we would help grow the economy.  I believe 
the economic pie is going to grow when savings increase and 
investments increase.  And therefore I think the job growth is 
going to be here.<p> 
 
		We also have another feature that I did not emphasize 
today that addresses the human capital need.  And that is the 
$2,000 deduction per person for higher education or for skilled 
training.  <p> 
 
		We think all of those features are important.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Carroll or Shirley.    		 
<b>COMMISSIONER CAMPBELL</b>:  One quick question.  And --		<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR NUNN</b>:  Let me add one other thing on that 
point.  <p> 
 
		But right now a person in, let's say, a modest-income 
bracket -- middle-income -- middle-, low-income -- they have a 
very hard time saving money.  <p> 
 
		We think our proposal would allow them to save money 
and get that capital that they need to begin small businesses, or 
for education or health purposes, or whatever they need.  <p> 
 
		Right now they have a very difficult time saving 
because they're paying taxes before they are able to put away 
savings.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Carroll Campbell.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER CAMPBELL</b>:  Senator, very briefly, you 
mentioned that younger people must be given encouragement and 
ability to save.  Do you treat long-term savings any different in 
yours than short-term savings?<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR NUNN</b>:  No.  If you pull it out of savings, and 
it goes into your consumption stream --<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER CAMPBELL</b>:  Right back.  That's what I --<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR NUNN</b>:  -- and you pay taxes on it.  It's a 
year-end calculation.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER CAMPBELL:</b>  Okay.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Shirley Peterson.<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR NUNN:</b>  So to the extent that you saved it over 
the year, then you would get a deduction.  <p> 
 
		If you just saved it for two months, and you didn't 
have that savings accumulated at the year-end, you would not get 
a deduction.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER CAMPBELL</b>:  The earnings on that savings as 
it's invested builds up tax-free, though, I believe I heard you 
say.<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR NUNN</b>:  As long as you reinvest it.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER CAMPBELL</b>:  As long as it stays in?<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR NUNN:  Right</b>. <p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER CAMPBELL</b>:  Yes.	<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR NUNN</b>:  Right.  If you go out and you get your 
earnings off that investment and you get a portrait painted of 
yourself, then you get taxed.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER CAMPBELL:</b>  But as long as it stays there 
and keeps earning?<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR NUNN</b>:  If you put it in a savings account where 
I can borrow it, and Jack can borrow it, and others can borrow 
it, then you get earning.<p> 
 
		The other feature that I would think is very attractive 
about this is capital gains.  This proposal would end the debate 
on capital gains; because if you took your capital gain and 
reinvested it, then it's deducted.  It's deferred.  <p> 
 
		But if you take your capital gains and consume it and 
spend it, then it's not.  <p> 
 
		For the first time, we can honestly say to the taxi 
driver, or the bank teller, or the person working as a school 
teacher, or anyone else, "Your income is no different from the 
investor's income that has a capital gain.<p> 
 
		"If you make $45,000 a year and you save $5,000, you're 
going to defer taxes on that.  <p> 
 
		"If a millionaire makes $5,000 capital gain, they're 
going to defer taxes if they reinvest it.  But if they consume 
it, they're going to pay taxes, just as you."<p> 
 
		It gets rid of this class debate on capital gains.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Senator Nunn has been joined by the 
distinguished Budget Chairman, Pete Domenici -- Senator Domenici.	<p> 
 
		Thank you, Pete, for coming over.  I know your schedule 
is brief.  <p> 
 
		The Chair has never been in this position before, 
caught in the ultimate conundrum of two distinguished U.S. 
Senators on both sides of the aisle and their important 
contribution to this debate, with Dick Armey sitting on the 
sidelines.<p> 
 
		Pete, do you have a -- Sam has been for a half-hour, 
talking with the Commission.  This is just a dialogue.  <p> 
 
		Do you want to share with us your perspective on the 
problems that you saw in the Code that led to your Domenici-Nunn 
bill.  		And thank you so much, Pete, for being here.

<p>
<p>
<center>REMARKS OF<a name="Pete V. Domenici"> SENATOR PETE V. DOMENICI</a></center> 
<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR DOMENICI</b>:  Thank you, <p> 
 
Mr. Chairman.		<p> 
 
		And I look around and I know most of you, some of your 
very well.  <p> 
 
		And I, first of all, what to congratulate you on 
accepting the responsibility of being on this advisory group.  I 
think it's absolutely critical that we do the right thing with 
tax reform and do it soon.<p> 
 
		My own thinking is very simple.  The Tax Code and the 
fiscal policy of this Nation have more to do with the future of 
our people than any other policies we talk about.  All others are 
dwarfed.  <p> 
 
		If we don't have the right fiscal policy and we don't 
have the right tax policy, we don't have "Opportunity America."  <p> 
 
		This Tax Code that we've got is backward.  It penalizes 
savings, penalizes investments.  And everything about it is kind 
of wrong-headed.<p> 
 
		I think it's so far off the mark.  And as to 
corporations, it is so cumbersome and so difficult that we ought 
to just throw the whole thing out.  <p> 
 
		So, we didn't start with the premise of tinkering with 
it.  We said, Let's have a whole new approach.<p> 
 
		I assume my friend and colleague, who has worked 
diligently on this and knows it very, very well -- frankly, we 
both worked hard enough, Chairman Kemp, that I think we can move 
over to the Finance Committee and help them a little.<p> 
 
		(Laughter)<p> 
 
		He's an armed service expert.  I'm supposedly a budget 
expert.  But I think we understand the Code now -- not in detail 
like some of you on this Commission.  <p> 
 
		But let me just say, I believe if you look at the 
corporate reform that's in this, you can't help but think it's 
something America ought to have.<p> 
 
		Simple as could be for those who understand corporate 
America, when the terrible things and these awful amortization-depreciation schedules that are audited ad 
nauseam that all kind 
of lawyers play around with and accountants spend millions on 
essentially put American business, not corporations, on a cash 
basis, that means they deduct what they purchase by way of 
equipment and the like.  <p> 
 
		At a point in time when this is passed, you'll get off 
all the things that bring accountants now from the Internal 
Revenue Service into our corporate headquarters, and they camp in 
some of them all year long -- some of you know that -- as to be 
compared with Japan, where they don't have such things.<p> 
 
		And we also make it border-adjustable.  We have to go 
through a process to do that, but I think it's very, very 
important that if you're going to reform the Tax Code, you tell 
the American people that American corporations will no longer be 
penalized as they sell in the world market vis-a-vis our foreign 
corporations that sell to us, or even American corporations.  <p> 
 
		So, we essentially have a flat, easy tax for 
corporations, and they're taxed as if they were in Atlanta, 
Georgia; or Albuquerque --even if they're overseas.  <p> 
 
		We don't think that's going to be onerous, but we think 
it's very fair.  It permits us to get down to that flat tax of 
about 10.5 percent.<p> 
 
		On the individual side, we can go through a lot of 
details, but we had some very simple but positive goals, and they 
were to increase American savings and increase investment by 
American people in productive things.  <p> 
 
		And we ended up considering the American savings pool 
to be sufficiently significant for America's future, to where we 
will give our citizens a tax break of significant proportions if 
they put their money in the savings pool.  And we won't tax them 
on it so long as they give it to that pool, which helps America.  <p> 
 
		So, right off the bat, this approach says anything you 
want to save, in any quantities you want to save, for anything 
you want to save.  Kind of a universal IRA.  You can do that.  <p> 
 
		But it also says we don't need a capital gains argument 
in America.  If you invest your money, you leave it there to be 
turned and churned and reinvested.  You don't pay tax, because we 
think the investment pool owned by individuals and investment 
entities is good for America.  <p> 
 
		So, we're saying to Americans, if you do that with your 
money, you don't pay income tax on it.  <p> 
 
		The upshot of it is we tax in a progressive way, and we 
thought progressivity was important.  It may not be, as you look 
at it.  But I would assume it may be hard to pass something that 
is not progressive.  We think it's good for America that it be 
progressive.  <p> 
 
		So, we have three brackets, but you can have whatever 
you would like.  And you only pay on what you spend, because 
essentially you deduct from what you earn -- all kinds of 
earnings, dividend earnings, any kind.  <p> 
 
		You deduct right off the top what you invest and what 
you save. <p> 
 
		And we think it has got a great opportunity, and it got 
a lot of opportunity built into it.  <p> 
 
		We cannot sit here, Mr. Chairman and Members, and say 
it's as simple as the notion of a flat tax.  But we would also 
suggest this is not a notion or an idea.  We've given you a 
total, full Tax Code.  <p> 
 
		We are very cautious fellows.  We asked so many 
questions they finally said, "Well, let's just write the whole 
damn thing so you can answer every question."  <p> 
 
		(Laughter)<p> 
 
		Now, that has made it such that we are picked on, 
because now people say, "Oh, this is not so good, because we know 
this about it."  		But, you see, we don't know this and 
that and the other about the other proposals.  They may all be 
wonderful, and you'll look at them all.  And I hope you come up 
with the best.<p> 
 
		Thank you very much.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Ed Feulner has a comment he wanted he 
wanted to make.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER FEULNER</b>:  Mr. Chairman, I just want to 
thank both Senators Domenici and Nunn for the leadership they've 
shown going back several years, when tax reform was not a very 
popular subject.  <p> 
 
		I sat in on some of those early meetings with our good 
friends at the Center for Strategic and International Studies as 
they assembled the group.  And you two really fought through some 
very, very serious battles.<p> 
 
		I don't have any questions, <p> 
 
Mr. Chairman, but I just applaud their leadership for many years 
in this area.<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR DOMENICI</b>:  Thank you.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Shirley Peterson.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER PETERSON</b>:  I also applaud your efforts.  <p> 
 
		I have studied your proposal with great interest, and I 
think it's fantastic that you got out there early thinking about 
this.<p> 
 
		I have one quick question.  One of our principles is to 
simplify the law.  One of the difficulties that we have in our 
current system is that we have not been able to define "income" 
easily.  	<p> 
 
		I'm a little concerned that we might face the same 
difficulty in defining "savings."  What is your response to that?<p> 
 
		SENATOR DOMENICI:  Our general response is we would 
define "savings" now pretty much like you do an IRA.  It would be 
financial savings, but it would also include investment.  	 
	So, we would have a rather broad definition.  It would not 
include things that are not financial in nature, and it would not 
include -- unless they were used directly in a business, like 
land, if it was used in a business for an apartment building or 
something of that nature.  	<p> 
 
		It would not include works of art, it would not include 
gold bullion.  But it would include gold stocks.  It would have 
to be a financial investment.<p> 
 
		So, we try to track the current Code as much as 
possible.<p> 
 
		I'd like to just throw out one other thing.  You talk 
about simplicity.  I know Chairman Archer has talked about a 
sales tax.  <p> 
 
		One of the things that makes ours -- and some people 
critique it on that ground -- a little more complex than it would 
otherwise be is the fact we came to a conclusion, after about a 
year of looking at this, that you had to do something about old 
savings if you do something about -- if you go to a consumption-based tax.  Whether it's done at the retail 
level, whether it's a 
value-added, or whether it is like ours, at the income level.  <p> 
 
		If you don't do that, what you are basically doing -- 
let's say you levied a <p> 
 
20 cent sales tax and replaced the Income Tax Code, if somebody 
saved all their lives and got $100,000 in the bank, and they're 
now -- they've already paid taxes on that and they're about to 
start consuming it, you have just taken #20,000 from them.  <p> 
 
		You've taken 20 percent of their life earnings.  We had 
to struggle with this old savings, because ours -- now, most 
people save less than $50,000, and we think we've got that part 
of it taken care of very simply, because we let them deduct and 
amortize that $50,000 as new savings, in effect writing it off 
over three years.  <p> 
 
		Above that, it gets a little more complicated.  And I 
won't go into it today.  But I would call your attention to the 
fact when you go to a consumption-based tax, whatever form, 
you've got to do something about old savings, otherwise you are 
penalizing people who've already been taxed and who have saved, 
in the name of encouraging it for others.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  You have done us a great honor.  And, 
Pete and Sam, thank you so very much on behalf of the Commission.  
<p> 
 
		And we hope to call -- we hope to do this again 
sometime in September, October.   <p> 
 
		And I say to both of you, as we begin the inventory the 
solutions, that helping focus on the problem, that is very 
helpful.  Thank you.  We appreciate your taking the time.<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR DOMENICI</b>:  Thank you.<p> 
 
		Mr. Chairman, might I just say --<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Yes, of course.<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR DOMENICI</b>:  I think you and your staff and all 
Members know that we did not put this together by ourselves.  So, 
there are experts in both the accounting field and from the 
business side --<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Right.	<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR DOMENICI</b>:  -- and auditors that help put it 
together, that modeled it.  It has been modeled because we gave 
them certain instructions. <p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Good.<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR DOMENICI</b>:  Your staff ought to know what those 
instructions were, because if you'd like different instructions, 
that will change the nature of it --<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Right.<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR DOMENICI</b>:  -- not the premises,  but the nature 
-- some of the specifics.  <p> 
 
		And that might make it more palatable to some of you or 
eliminate some of your questions.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Thank you.<p>

<center><b>REMARKS OF CONGRESSMAN <a name="Richard K. Armey">RICHARD K. ARMEY</a> </b></center> 
<p> 
 
<center><b>MAJORITY LEADER US HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES</b></center> 
<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  Let me say, first of all, I 
appreciate all of you giving of your time and time and effort to 
deal with this issue.  It's going to be, I think, a very complex 
but very much a central part of the public policy debate for the 
next few years.<p> 
 
		You've already heard from people who advocate the Nunn-Domenici proposal, the sales 
tax.  And now you hear from me.  <p> 
 
		But I think one thing that you will see we have a 
universal agreement on is the current Tax Code as we know it is 
no longer acceptable to the American people.  <p> 
 
		And I thought I would talk this morning very briefly on 
two points:<p> 
 
		Why is it the American people are so discontent -- 
even, I would say, angry -- about the current Tax Code and the 
manner in which it is enforced?  <p> 
 
		And you don't have to travel very far in this country 
before you encounter the frustration, the anger, the anxiety that 
forebodes the average American taxpayer.  <p> 
 
		Clearly, the first complaint that you hear from the 
taxpayer is that it is too complex.  That complexity is felt 
individually by the individual as something ominous.  <p> 
 
		I file my own taxes.  I have always done my own taxes.  
I have a Ph.D. in economics.  I have a considerable number of -- 
graduate  training in accounting.  <p> 
 
		And I still find myself -- struggle as I may over every 
bit of detail in each one of these complex manuals and giving it 
my best shot, filing my taxes in full confidence that I have done 
my utmost to comply with the law -- living, then, for several 
months in some dread fear that I will have a knock on the door or 
an ominous letter in my mailbox explaining to me how it is that 
somehow I missed something, and am therefore presumed to have 
been guilty of cheating on my taxes.<p> 
 
		And I have to tell you, I may not be very bright, Mr. 
Chairman, but I am not crazy.  If I'm going to pick somebody to 
have a fight with on purpose, it will not be the IRS.<p> 
 
		(Laughter)<p> 
 
		So, I assure you I am as meticulous as I can be, and 
yet I can't be confident that I didn't make a mistake.<p> 
 
		And I think that kind of dread fear is something every 
American citizen lives with today.<p> 
 
		Now, the complexity has another dimension to it that is 
not perhaps so personal.  We spend $5.4 billion manhours in 
America every year complying with the Tax Code.  That's more 
time, more manhours than is spent in the production of every car, 
truck, and van produced in this country each year.<p> 
 
		That is $232 billion worth of compliance cost.  And 
insofar as that is more than is necessary, it is sheer deadweight 
loss and waste in the economy.  <p> 
 
		Each one of these manhours, each dollar of this $232 
billion could be put to some productive use, rather than to the 
deadweight loss use of simply complying with federally -- 
government-mandated red tape.  <p> 
 
		Waste is always counterproductive.  Waste always goes 
against growth, against efficiency, against standard of living, 
and it is never something that can be accepted or tolerated in 
any economy that works to allocate scarce and precious resources 
to their best alternative use.  And this I think is something 
that we need to understand.  <p> 
 
		And I think at some level the American people 
understand.  It is a waste.  <p> 
 
		People kid me about the flat tax.  "Will it be enacted 
into law?  If it is, what will -- how will we know?"  <p> 
 
		And I say, "Well, you will know because the sales of 
Rolaids will go down between January 1 and April 15th.<p> 
 
		(Laughter)<p> 
 
		And that is the sort of intuitive, <p> 
 
in-our-stomach understanding that "There's waste afoot here, and 
it's coming back to roost in my backyard."<p> 
 
		I should not spend two weekends and several evenings 
between January 1 and April 15th being short-tempered and 
insensitive and intolerant with my wife because she might have 
lost a receipt someplace --<p> 
 
		(Laughter)<p> 
 
		-- when, in fact, it was probably me in the first 
place.<p> 
 
		(Laughter)<p> 
 
		Or too busy to spend time with the children, because I 
got hung up -- the receipts.<p> 
 
		That's waste in a very personal way.<p> 
 
		Double-taxation is a very big part of the current Tax 
Code.  It is always incredible to me that somebody can look at 
this Tax Code and look at the rate structure and say it's fair, 
when in this Tax Code, we have billions of -- hundreds of 
billions of dollars that escape the tax base altogether, and then 
at the same time turn around and impose double-taxations on 
hundreds of billions of other dollars.  What can be more unfair 
than that?<p> 
 
		But that is particularly important when the double-taxation almost always and almost 
universally falls on savings 
and investment, which are the two engines of economic growth.<p> 
 
		Finally, people are aware of the fact that the high tax 
rates slow economic growth. 		And here is the shocking 
statistical revelation.  You'll find it on page 1 of my formal 
remarks, which I would ask you to put in the record.  	Despite 
all that we have done -- certainly the leadership shown by Jack 
Kemp in the early '80s to get rid of and lower high marginal 
rates -- by comparison with 1965, when fewer than 3 percent of 
American families filing joint reports had a marginal rate at or 
above <p> 
 
28 percent, today -- or in 1999 -- '91 -- in 1991, 36 percent of 
American families filing joint returns filed at a marginal rate 
at or above 28 percent.<p> 
 
		If there is anything, any single statistic that says to 
me Milton Friedman was right when he said "bracket creep" --<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Right.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY:</b>  -- this is the statistic.  <p> 
 
		The fact of the matter is we are more beleaguered by 
the oppressive impact of high marginal rates on incentive to 
economic growth and individual initiative now than we were even 
before the high drama of the '80s and the tax reforms we 
attempted in the '80s.  <p> 
 
		And that translates into lost economic opportunity, 
lost growth.<p> 
 
		Finally, the American people think of the current Tax 
Code as unfair.  And that comes largely out of the complexity.  <p> 
 
		There is an abiding belief by almost every American 
taxpayer that "There's a break in the Code for everybody but me," 
or more breaks for others.<p> 
 
		(Sound of bell)<p> 
 
		That, ladies and gentlemen, is a bell that indicates I 
have a vote.  I would like to spend the next five minutes and 
complete my statement and then, if you will, I'll go vote.  And 
if you would like, I would then come back.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Oh, good.	<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  But I must make the vote.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Dick Gephardt has just walked in.  We 
want to hear him as well.<p> 
 
		Since -- did you say you were going to go right now?  <p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  Well, I would like to finish my 
statement first.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Okay.  Please do.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  So that -- and I would say it is 
this heartfelt belief that this complex system that "has a break 
for everybody but me" us unfair.  <p> 
 
		And therefore you will see people who will say, 
"Therefore, I'll give myself a break."  		And that, in my 
estimation, is the fundamental cause of what we know as the 
underground economy -- not the criminal economy, but the 
underground economy, which is technically criminal, but criminal 
behavior but normally law-abiding men.  <p> 
 
		The plumber who says, "I'll do your job on Saturday if 
you pay me in cash, because I've got no break that this guy down 
the road has gotten.  I know he's got it.  Even though I can't 
find it, I know he's got it."<p> 
 
		And then secondly, because it's so complex and has 
seemed to be so unfair, that person who is tempted to the 
underground economy says, "And I can do that and get away with 
it. Because of all the hundreds of billions of data points that 
the IRS must keep track of, they'd never find this little 
Saturday morning data point anyway."<p> 
 
		So, if you feel self-justified in cutting a corner in 
such a way that you won't get caught, you will have a low 
resistance to the temptations of the underground economy.<p> 
 
		Now, as I examined these circumstances in the current 
Tax Code and said, "How do we fix this," I was brought to the 
flat tax.  And this is what I would suggest to you the flat tax 
has to offer if you will look at it.  <p> 
 
		First, it's simplicity.  That, of course, is 
exemplified by the single <p> 
 
postcard-size form.  <p> 
 
		You know, it is a very simple matter, and incidentally, 
I would say, honest and direct matter of just simply taking that 
income that you earned, deduct from that a generous family 
allowance, and apply a single rate to that which is in excess of 
that allowance.  <p> 
 
		You don't have to hunt up all those receipts for all 
that complex and mysterious itemized deductions.  <p> 
 
		You don't have to worry about what is the definition. <p> 
 
		You know, I have a very small annuity program from my 
old years as a college professor.  I get $144 a month for my 
retirement, which, of course, reminds me that tenure meets not 
having enough money forever.<p> 
 
		(Laughter)<p> 
 
		And every time I file my taxes, I've got to try to 
figure out if this is, in this line, at A or B, because I have to 
understand the definition -- legal definitions of that. <p> 
 
		It's fair.  You know, everybody gets treated the same.  
	<p> 
 
		And let me suggest to you that as you watch the 
political debate of the next two years in America on this issue 
of taxation and on other issues, you're going to see a great 
national debate on what is fair.<p> 
 
		And I will believe, from what I've seen just in the 
testimonies I've got regarding the flat tax, that America today, 
more than at any time in our history, is coming to the belief 
that what is fair is that this government treat everybody exactly 
the same as everybody else.  		And when people believe that 
they are being treated fairly, they have lost the temptation to 
give themselves the break that they didn't get relative to the 
other person.<p> 
 
		But more than any other thing I hear, it is fair.  It's 
simple, it's obvious, it's honest, it's fair.  And I like that.  
That's the typical American response.<p> 
 
		The flat tax promotes economic growth, I think, to as 
much a degree as you can with the Tax Code, and in a very few 
specific rates, which I'll be happy to discuss after I go vote.  		The low rates are real, especially the 
low marginal 
rate is real and indisputable and obvious.  <p> 
 
		Double-taxation is ended in the flat tax, so we no 
longer have a tax bias against savings and investment.  It is 
neutral.  <p> 
 
		Under the flat tax, people will make decisions to save, 
invest, or consume based upon their personal family financial or 
business economic circumstances and conditions and not cajoled by 
some bias in the Tax Code.<p> 
 
		And then, of course, the specific treatment of capital 
is very important.  We expense capital for economic growth in 
America in the end of this century and the beginning of the next 
century that will be so much centered in the high tech, 
communications, electronics, computerized sectors of the economy, 
where new technology we know brought on line today is likely to 
be obsolete in two years from now.  		You have an 
incentive to make that investment when you can expense it and 
recapture its cost, knowing that two years from now you can even 
get more in tune with the new modern future that you didn't even 
imagine two years ago.  <p> 
 
		So, this, I think, is an extremely important growth 
component for a critical sector of our future economy.<p> 
 
		Finally, let me say, before I leave and surrender the 
podium -- and I will come back if you like --<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Thank you.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  -- the flat tax, in my estimation, 
is an important innovation, because public policy, in order to 
prevail in America, must be accepted by America.  <p> 
 
		And the American people have demonstrated that they 
love the simplicity, the honesty, the directness, the fairness of 
the flat tax.  <p> 
 
		And there is no public policy that can be more easily 
and more inexpensively and less intrusively administered than 
that which is accepted by the American people.  <p> 
 
		So, the deadweight loss I think will go away, along 
with the incentive for underground economy.<p> 
 
		And again, I'm --<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Dick, thanks. <p> 
 
		You go vote, come back.<p> 
 
		We'll hear from Senator Mack, Chairman of the Joint 
Economic Committee.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  Thank you.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Thank you, Dick.	<p> 
 
		(Pause)<p> 
 
		It is a personal honor and a great privilege to 
introduce the Chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, my friend 
Connie Mack, the Senator from Florida.<p> 
 
		I won't introduce you to all the Commissioners, Connie, 
but I know you know all of the men and women in one forum or 
another who are on the Commission.  <p> 
 
		We are inventorying the problems of the Code and the 
nexus between taxes and growth and the budget.  <p> 
 
		And with your interest in those three issues, we 
thought it would be particularly appropriate to have your 
leadership on this issue, and we'd like you to make some comments 
and then have a dialogue with the Commission.  It's not a 
hearing, per se.  <p> 
 
		It's a public -- our first public hearing, so to speak, 
on the problems of the Code as we begin to look forward to the 
solutions down the road.<p> 
 
		So, please take what time you would like, and allow us 
to have some questions.   And then Dick Armey and, I think, Dick 
Gephardt both said they'd come back and maybe sit on a panel.<p> 
 
		Thank you.

<center><b>REMARKS OF <a name="Connie Mack">SENATOR CONNIE MACK</a></b> </center> 
<p> 
 
<center><b>CHAIRMAN, JOINT ECONOMIC COMMITTEE</b></center> 
<p> 
 
		<b>SENIOR MACK</b>:  Well, first of all, I want to thank you, 
Jack, for the opportunity to participate this morning.<p> 
 
		And I want to express my deep appreciation for the 
members of the panel in taking the time that I know that I know 
that is requiring of you to engage yourself and involve yourself 
in what I think is one of the most significant issues that faces 
our Nation.<p> 
 
		As you hear from people today, you're probably going to 
hear more in the specifics with respect to the various aspects of 
tax reform than you're going to hear from me, because, frankly, I 
want to address the issue from a broader perspective.<p> 
 
		I believe that the primary objective -- the thing that 
ought to be on your mind as you work your way through a series of 
decisions about the future Tax Code, the number one priority, as 
far as I'm concerned, is what does it do to growth, what does it 
do to jobs creation, what does it do with respect to business 
formation, what does it do with respect to technology, how does 
it affect the flow of capital from old technologies to new 
technologies?<p> 
 
		So, the first and primary objective I think you ought 
to keep in your mind as you work through the issue of reform is 
what is this going to do to our ability as a Nation to grow and 
provide opportunities to all Americans.<p> 
 
		Allow me to, again, take a somewhat broader perspective 
on this issue.  	<p> 
 
		Again, in speaking about the issue of growth -- and I 
would tie it into this next seven years, the commitment that has 
been made and will be made in these next few days by the Congress 
to work our way towards a balanced budget in the year 2002.  <p> 
 
		Almost always you hear from people there are really 
only two ways to address the budget deficit issue.  They either 
say you've got to raise taxes, or you've got to cut spending in 
order to get there.  	<p> 
 
		Many of us have been trying to make the case that there 
is a third and -- I was going to say "equally important."  I 
would make the case "more important" method to address the issue 
of deficit reduction.  And that's growth in the economy.  	 
		<p> 
 
		So, I think what you're involved in is vital to the 
future of the Nation from the perspective of over the next seven 
years, if we're going to meet this target -- and I'm convinced 
that we will -- that the conclusions that you draw with respect 
to the decisions you make and the recommendations that you make 
to those of us who will be out making a campaign statement to the 
American people in 1996 -- again, I think it's going to be vital, 
what you develop, as to our ability both to meet that target of a 
balanced budget by 2002 and to provide hope and opportunity to 
all Americans.<p> 
 
		Let me add another perspective here.  Several years ago 
I read a book by Jacques Attile (phonetic) that enraged me, 
frankly.  And it was -- the book was called <i>Millennium</i>.<p> 
 
		And in the book, basically Jacques Attile lays out that 
America's time in the sun has past, that the American century is 
over, it's behind us, that the future belongs either to the 
Europeans, the French, and the Germans, or to the Asians, and 
that America's time has passed.<p> 
 
		Now, I must say I'm a fairly competitive person.  So, 
as I was reading through this book, I could find myself really 
getting angry about what I was -- what I was reading.  <p> 
 
		But I think at some point you have to stop and ask 
yourself, well, is there any possibility that the premise could 
be true.  	<p> 
 
		And if there is some possibility to ask ourselves the 
question, "Well, what do we need to do to remain the center of 
influence in the 21st century?" -- and the first thing you might 
say or first thing you might hear from others, is, "Well, what 
difference does it make?"<p> 
 
		Well, I think it makes a tremendous amount of 
difference.  The first, of course, is obvious, it's -- it will 
have a direct effect on our children and our grandchildren.  <p> 
 
		If we're the center of influence into the 21st century, 
it's fairly easy to draw the conclusion that we will be able to 
enhance the standard of living for our children and 
grandchildren.<p> 
 
		But I would make the case that it goes a lot deeper 
than that.  A great nation has to set itself on a course to 
achieve something greater than itself.  And I would claim that 
that the greatness that we want to try to accomplish in the 21st 
century and the reason that we want to remain the center of 
influence is because I am convinced our Nation is the only nation 
on the globe that has the right kinds of policies, the belief in 
freedom and justice and democracy and human rights and 
capitalism.	<p> 
 
		And we are the only nation in the world, I believe, 
that is committed to exporting those ideas and those principles 
around the globe.<p> 
 
		So, again, I say to you, what you're engaged in I think 
is vital to the future.  It will, in fact, enable America to be 
the center of influence.  We will be able to export those ideas 
of freedom and justice and capitalism.<p> 
 
		And some people will respond and say, "Wait a minute, 
you know, I don't buy, you know, that kind of moral argument that 
you're making.  I'm more interested in "What can I do for the 
folks back home in my district?"	<p> 
 
		I would make the argument out of this that if, in fact, 
we are able to export those principles, that have made this 
Nation great, think of the huge markets that will have been 
created around the world in which our sons and daughters will 
have an opportunity to produce and sell in.<p> 
 
		So, I think there is a tremendous motivation behind 
what you're involved in.  And again, I commend you for the effort 
that you're making and your willingness to spend the time to be 
involved in this, what I think is a great cause.<p> 
 
		Now, let me go on to another point of this.  In 
essence, what do we have to do then?  I mean, how do we approach 
this issue of how we remain the center of influence?  <p> 
 
		Well, it's obvious the first thing that comes to my 
mind is that we have to be in a situation where we protect our 
basic civil liberties, and we enhance the capitalism that has 
made us great.<p> 
 
		And how do we do that?  Well, I think we need to listen 
to some of those who have been talking about the future.  <p> 
 
		Several weeks ago, I held a hearing of the Joint 
Economic Committee on "Economic Policy in the 21st Century."  <p> 
 
		And one of the individuals that I had at the hearing 
was Alvin Toffler.  Toffler -- everybody kind of hears Toffler 
talk about the <p> 
 
-- how we have moved from a hunting and gathering society through 
agriculture, through industrial -- into the information 
communications age.  <p> 
 
		But if you focus on that, I think you've missed the 
message.  What Alvin Toffler really says, from an economic 
perspective, is that you've got to look beyond the old factors of 
production of land, labor, and capital, because there, in fact, 
is another element today.  That element totally changes the 
future.  And that element is knowledge.  <p> 
 
		I mean, production in the future and our ability to 
produce and grow and remain the center of influence is going to 
come from adding to those basic factors that we term "knowledge."<p> 
 
		I think that when you accept that additional factor, it 
explodes the myth of scarcity, which leads me to another 
individual that I would say that my dear friend Jack Kemp focused 
me on, probably now six years ago, when George Guilder came out 
with his book called <i>Microcosm</i>.  It is a history of the 
microchip, the history of the computer.  	<p> 
 
		And he makes many of the same points.  I'd like to take 
just a moment though and -- Guilder says, "The central event of 
the 20th century is the overthrow of matter.  The powers of mind 
are everywhere ascending over the brute force of things."<p> 
 
		And, in essence, what he is arguing is that economics 
is going to move away from a study of scarcity to the allocation 
of abundance.  <p> 
 
		Now, the problem that I think that we're dealing with 
is that we find ourselves kind of boxed in to an old way of 
thinking.  I mean, this is a new world, it is a new age.  And 
there are new opportunities, and we have to develop new ways of 
looking at those opportunities.<p> 
 
		I was struck this weekend as I read through David 
Broder's article in the <i>Washington Post</i> that was entitled "The 
Democrat Divide."  And it quotes a Michael Rothschild, a 
San Francisco futurist.  He sets forth the proposition that the 
microchip revolution is ushering in a new era of abundance, 
vanquishing scarcity to the dustbin of history.<p> 
 
		And so, again, I think it is important for us to 
understand that we are, in fact, moving into a new age.  And 
we've got to get out of the thinking of economic policy that 
basically was developed with mass production, mass communication, 
mass everything.<p> 
 
		Well, today we know that there are niche markets.  We 
know that computers are used to both design and define what those 
markets are.  	<p> 
 
		And so we have to come up with economic policies that 
reflect this new age.<p> 
 
		Now, we're going to have quite a debate, and you're 
going to be involved in a whole series of choices that you're 
going to have to go through about how to put together a Tax Code 
for the 21st century.  <p> 
 
		I took this opportunity to develop a list of 10 
principles for the tax system for the 21st century, and I'll 
leave this -- I'm not going to go through it at this point, with 
the exception of maybe picking out just two.<p> 
 
		I think again, thinking from the perspective that 
growth is what we want to try to accomplish with a Tax Code, you 
have to ask yourself the question "What single thing can you do 
that will affect growth more than anything else?"  <p> 
 
		I think it's the lowest possible marginal tax rate that 
you can come up with, because I believe that if you lower the 
marginal tax rate, that you, in fact, will provide the incentive 
-- you will give people encouragement.  		You will say to 
them that "There is a reward for your work, for your savings, for 
your investing."  It is clearly the way to release and encourage 
the American spirit of innovation.<p> 
 
		So, the lowest possible marginal tax rate I think has 
got to be on the top of the list.<p> 
 
		The second point that I would make is I think whatever 
plan or program that you come up with, it should be neutral.  <p> 
 
		I hear a lot of my colleagues saying -- and it began 
back when we had the debates in 1986 about tax reform.  You know, 
there was a lot of talk about we need to punish consumption.  		Well, you know, I am not an 
economist, but I have -- I 
have listened to a number of economists over the years.  I don't 
recall seeing an economic equation that said that you can enhance 
growth by punishing consumption.<p> 
 
		Now, I want to encourage savings and investing, but 
what I'm saying to you is I think that you can encourage savings 
and investing without punishing consumption.  Because if I 
remember correctly, consumption plus investment equals what, 
income? <p> 
 
		So, what I'm saying is that, again, I think you need to 
try to work towards a Tax Code that, in fact, both encourages 
savings and investing and does so without punishing consumption.  
And I think that that can be done.<p> 
 
		Lastly, let me just make several other points.  And 
then I'll stop and try to respond to whatever questions you all 
have.<p> 
 
		One of the issues we're going deal with -- and we hear 
it day after day after day, by my colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle, is this pitting Americans against each other, trying 
to pit one group of Americans against another group, one class 
versus another class, or creating the concept that there, in 
fact, is a class in our society.<p> 
 
		And I would say, if you look at some of the data that 
the Joint Economic Committee over the years has produced with 
respect to income distribution, really the way we ought to be 
talking about it is "income mobility," because there is true 
income mobility in our society, probably unlike any other society 
in the world.<p> 
 
		Just a couple of quick statistics:  From 1979 to 1988, 
86 percent of the wage earners in the lowest percentile, 20 
percentile of the country, 86 percent moved up into a higher 
percentile, 86 percent.<p> 
 
		You had a greater probability that you would go to the 
top 20 percentile than remaining in the 20 percentile.  Now, I 
think that's rather significant.  <p> 
 
		And we need to drive that message home, because if we 
get caught into this trap that there is some kind of a static 
model that we have to live with, then you're just in a situation 
you're trying to pit one group of winners and losers against the 
other, and I think that would be a tragedy.<p> 
 
		And the other point that I would make is that -- again, 
from the statistical data that was developed -- is that 52 
percent -- almost <p> 
 
53 percent of the people were in the top 20 -- or, excuse me, the 
top 1 percent in 1979 -- 52 percent of them fell into lower 
categories during those periods.  <p> 
 
		So, it's not just -- the point in all of this is that 
there is constant motion, that, in fact, if you provide people 
with incentive, they're going to move.  <p> 
 
		And that's where I come back again to:  The lowest 
marginal tax rate provides the greatest incentive.	    <p> 
 
		I guess I could go on and on, <p> 
 
Mr. Chairman, but I think the last point that I would make would 
be with respect to capital gains.  And I know capital gains has 
been talked about by economists in many different ways.  <p> 
 
		And frankly, this is a thought that I picked up in 
discussions with my friend Congressman Armey.<p> 
 
		If you think about capital gains as being a voluntary 
tax, which it, in essence, is -- if you think the tax rate is too 
high, you just voluntarily say, "I'm going to keep my money,  I'm 
not going to give it to the government, and you don't sell."<p> 
 
		But as a result of that, capital gains has become, if 
you will, a barrier or a wall that has been built around the 
investments that have taken place in the past, in the old 
technologies of the past.<p> 
 
		And what we want to do is we want to rip down those 
walls, and we want to let that capital flow into the new 
technologies.  That's where America's future is.<p> 
 
		So, again, I close with my comments, but again 
commending both Chairman Kemp and for -- and to all of you for 
your involvement in this.  I think it is a great endeavor, and I 
look for forward to seeing the product of what you produce.<p> 
 
		Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Well, Senator, we've been sitting here 
since 10 o'clock this morning, and we've heard some eloquent 
testimony.  <p> 
 
		But that -- I know I speak for all the Commissioners 
when I say that came from not only the head but the heart.  <p> 
 
		And I've heard you speak many times -- this is an 
editorial comment, and I know I speak for Carroll, with whom we 
all served together -- I have never heard you in finer form with 
regard to your vision of America in the 21st century.  	 
	And I know that's what Bob Dole and Newt Gingrich wanted us 
to do, is to put together, on a tabula rasa, a clean slate, a <p> 
 
Tax Code for the 21st century.  <p> 
 
		And you have helped set the predicate for that, 
reminded us that the ultimate wealth is not what's in the ground, 
it's what is in the heart and mind of the American people.  <p> 
 
		And I just really can't pass up the opportunity to say 
to you just thanks for the keynote address of this Commission.<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR MACK</b>:  Thank you.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Shirley Peterson, former Commissioner 
of the IRS and an old friend of yours, I know.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER PETERSON</b>:  Senator Mack, thank you very 
much.  <p> 
 
		I find your statement very provocative and eloquent.  <p> 
 
		And I must say that one point that you made has really 
captured my imagination, and that is the issue -- the point of 
thinking about knowledge as part of the capital of this country 
and trying to design some way to encourage its growth, shall we 
say.  <p> 
 
		Because in addition to accomplishing all of the goals 
and principles that you set out, certainly it would increase the 
income mobility, it would create all the incentive, all the 
opportunity, all the hope that America stands for.  <p> 
 
		So, I am just excited by that suggestion.  And we will 
try to design some way to build that into our new system.<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR MACK</b>:  Thank you.	<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER CAIN</b>:  (Inaudible)<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Herman Cain has a --		 
<b>COMMISSIONER PETERSON</b>:  (Inaudible) here.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  I'm sorry, Herman Cain has a question.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER CAIN</b>:  Thank you for coming, Senator Mack.  
It's good to see you.  <p> 
 
		And because I have the advantage of knowing your 
previous life, before you became a distinguished Senator here in 
Washington, and when you talked about your reaction in reading 
the <i>Millennium</i>, it triggered a disturbing statement that an early 
century economist by the name of Joseph Shumpter (phonetic) made.  
He said the greatest threat to capitalism is not its failure, but 
its success.  		<p> 
 
		And that has disturbed me, much as your observation 
with respect to the <i>Millennium</i>.  And when you think about that -- 
and that may be where we are -- we are at that crest of success, 
and that's what we are dealing with, and the fact that when you 
talk about capitalism and the use of capitalism, you are talking 
about businesses and business people using that to create the 
productivity that you've talked about.<p> 
 
		My question would be:  What are your thoughts about 
business leaders and businesspeople and the business community, 
since you have a relatively recent involvement directly as a 
business person; and now having been in Washington for a number 
of years, what are your thoughts in terms of how will businesses 
embrace radical change, revolutionary change, in terms of how we 
collect revenue from businesses, not necessarily the individual 
income tax side?<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR MACK</b>:  That's a difficult question, frankly, to 
respond to, because there are so many facets of business, so many 
-- we're going to have businesses who are, in essence, moving 
into the 21st century.  There are going to be businesses that 
initially will feel threatened as a result of change.<p> 
 
		I would say to them that they should encourage this 
change, because frankly it will open up to them the same 
opportunities that I see for individuals.  <p> 
 
		And what I'm referring to there is that I can remember 
-- again historically -- and I think we've all recognized this.  <p> 
 
		As we have moved move from an agricultural-based 
society to an industrial-based society, the agriculture community 
was worried about, well, if the Congress and the country is going 
to be facing on this new industrial age, what's going to happen 
to us?  <p> 
 
		Well, the reality is that what the farmers of America 
did is they finally embraced the new age, the industrial age, and 
they used those technologies to enhance their production, their 
capability.<p> 
 
		So, what I'm saying to you is that while we're going to 
hear, I think, some concerns from what some would refer to as <p> 
 
second-wave industries, whether that be the automobile industry 
in Detroit, which I just recently visited -- and it's really 
amazing to see what the automobile industry is doing with the 
development of the new -- use of new technologies. <p> 
 
		So, I think, again, what we ought to try to focus on, 
in addition to the lower marginal rates that I talked about, is 
what can we do to encourage the flow of capital that will allow 
these new technologies to move into the old industries, to 
enhance their ability to compete internationally.  <p> 
 
		And I guess that would be another point that's obvious 
to everybody.  We are so much, today, engaged in -- in 
international competition that what we have to do is enhance our 
businesses' abilities to compete.  <p> 
 
		And I think -- if I can make one, maybe one last point 
in this, last year a fellow by the name of George Hatsophilos 
(phonetic) came and testified or spoke with a group of Senators 
that Senator Packwood and Senator Domenici had put together.  <p> 
 
		And he had indicated that as a young man from Greece, 
he had looked all throughout the world to find what land provided 
the greatest opportunity for entrepreneurism.  And he chose 
America.<p> 
 
		And what we want to do with our Tax Code is to make 
sure that the next generation of George Hatsophiloses who look 
for entrepreneur capital of the world still believe that America 
is that capital.  <p> 
 
		And I think we can do that again with the kinds of 
reforms that you all are going to be looking at with respect to 
the Tax Code.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  All growth in an economy is the result 
of risk-taking men and women who are willing to take the fruits 
of their labor and put it at risk on a new idea and go through 
the vicissitudes and vagaries in competition of the marketplace.  <p> 
 
		And you have reminded us today that consumption is the 
reward for production and savings is consumption deferred.<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR MACK</b>:  Absolutely.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  And your testimony is just absolutely 
laser-like in reminding this Commission that -- all of us, as 
Americans, the stake we have in setting the marginal tax rate in 
peacetime at the level of equilibrium at which people are willing 
to maximize their output and still pay that fundamental tax.<p> 
 
		I don't know where it is, but from Biblical times to 
today, there is empirical evidence -- I know I'm not supposed to 
come the any conclusions, because I've got a hat on now as a 
chairman -- but I have said many, many times, in my study of 
history, that the level of equilibrium is in the 20s, not the 40s 
and 50s, where we are today, you know..<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Ed Feulner.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER FEULNER</b>:  I, too, want to thank you, Mr. 
Chairman.  	<p> 
 
		Two prefatory comments, if I may. <p> 
 
		First, I commend you for what you're doing with the 
Joint Economic Committee, in terms of the educational efforts.  <p> 
 
		I caught, on C-SPAN, your discussion with June O'Neill, 
the Director of the Congressional Budget Office, trying to make 
sense out of some very arcane number debates.  And it was very 
enlightening for me, who thought I knew a lot about some of these 
related subjects, because I learned a lot.<p> 
 
		Secondly, I know I speak for everybody on the 
Commission when I say we look forward to seeing your whole list 
of 10 principles, because I sure agree with the first three I 
heard.<p> 
 
		You were in the House, I think, at the time of the '86 
tax reform.  Chairman Archer, when he was here this morning, 
made, I think, a very telling point.  And that is that was 
supposed to be a simplifying, flattening, fairing kind of 
approach to tax reform.  It didn't work.	<p> 
 
		Subsequent to that, we have had two major tax 
increases, each of them, in effect, the largest tax increases 
we've had in our history, both as a result of the '91 budget deal 
and the tax increase of 1993.  <p> 
 
		What went wrong and how do we avoid that again, if, in 
fact, we are able to come in with some proposals that the 
Congress then accepts in terms of moving toward a fairer, flatter 
tax system?<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR MACK</b>;  Yes, that's a question, frankly, that 
has gone through my mind several times.  <p> 
 
		And those of us who have gone through this process, 
probably at the end of it -- I know one of the conclusions that I 
came to was why should we be surprised at what came out of 1986?  
I mean, that's -- the process was the same.  The interests were 
basically the same.  		"Why should we expect anything 
different?" is really the question that you're asking.<p> 
 
		The conclusion that I have come to is because we're 
different.  The Congress is different.  <p> 
 
		There was an incredible message that was sent by the 
people of this country in 1994.  I mean, it's amazing to listen 
to the people here in Washington, D.C., the things that they're 
saying to us -- like, you know, we should have been doing this a 
long time ago.  <p> 
 
		So, what I'm saying to you is I think the people who 
make up the Congress today are totally different.  We have a 
different way of looking at the process.  Lots of us want to 
change the process.  <p> 
 
		So, I guess what I'm saying to you is I think, Ed, that 
this is occurring just at the right time.<p> 
 
		And then the point -- the last point that I would make 
is:  There are some -- and Senator Packwood may have indicated 
this -- was he here earlier?<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  No, Senator Packwood, incidentally, to 
my colleagues, had to cancel because of the governors who are 
meeting over in the Senate.<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR MACK</b>:  Okay.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  So, he will not be here.  So --<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR MACK</b>:  If Senator Packwood were here, he 
probably would say to you what he has said to me.  He thinks that 
the momentum in the country has built to the point where there's 
a chance that we could pass tax reform next year.  		Well, 
I must say to you, I don't think we're quite to that point.  But 
here is the thing -- and this is how I would like to see all of 
this play out -- is that you do your work and develop a proposal, 
hopefully, that would be embraced by the Republican -- at least 
the Republican members of the Congress.  <p> 
 
		I would love to see the Republican standard-bearer in 
1996 take it as the cause, as the contract, if you will.  Boy, 
what a change in America's attitude.  <p> 
 
		There was a contract offered in 1994.  The American 
people said, "We support that.  We want you to go back to 
Washington.  We came back, and we're doing it."<p> 
 
		And I think if we go to the American people in 1996 
with a new contract about tax reform, with low marginal tax 
rates, offering hope and opportunity, you elect us, we'll go back 
to Washington in 1997, and we'll pass true tax reform.  I think 
we, in fact, can do it.  It's a different Congress.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Ken Blackwell.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER BLACKWELL</b>:  Senator Mack, I would like to 
join the chorus of thanks for your clarity and for your vision.  <p> 
 
		If the objective of good tax policy is to minimize -- 
excuse me, maximize economic growth and the rising real incomes 
and real tax receipts that go along with that economic growth, 
then the most efficient tax rate on capital gains is zero.<p> 
 
		Have things changed so radically in Washington and in 
Congress that we can expect that folks will rise above the 
political hurdle and deal with that, that reality?     	 
	<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR MACK</b>:  My reaction is yes.  		Assuming 
that the premise that I gave earlier with respect to income 
mobility is correct -- and I've heard the Chairman many times 
refer to presidential candidate McGovern, who offered a tax 
proposal to the country which was just flat rejected.  And the 
reason it was rejected, people said, "Look, I hope to be rich 
some day."<p> 
 
		I mean, there is a belief in this nation, and it is 
built on fact.  It's built on the stories that all of us hear 
from people all across this Nation, of all ages, all colors, who 
basically say, "Give me the opportunity and I'll succeed, and 
I'll move up."  <p> 
 
		So, if the premise is right and people understand that 
capital formation is key to our competitive advantage and to 
providing us with the tools to compete, then they're going to 
support it, because they know in the long run it is in their best 
interests to do so.  <p> 
 
		But, again, we can't be faint-hearted about making the 
-- providing the message.  I mean, I -- every time I talk about 
capital gains -- and I've done it now since 13 years that I've 
been involved in the Congress -- every time I do it, you know, 
somebody wants to make a charge that, "You know, Mack is just 
interested in the wealthy."<p> 
 
		Well, if we're going to let that charge deny us from 
making the claim about what the future is all about and what 
eliminating the tax on capital gains would do and the 
opportunities it would provide, if we're going to -- we might as 
well get out of the arena.    <p> 
 
		But I think we have a case to make.  In fact -- <p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Your explanation that the capital gains 
tax is, in essence, a transaction tax, it's a voluntary tax.  If 
you don't transact or sell anything, you don't pay it.  The only 
people who have to pay it are middle-income working men and women 
who want to save to send their children to college.  <p> 
 
		And so it ends up that the capital gains tax is not a 
tax on the rich, it's a tax <p> 
 
-- they're already rich.  They're going to get rich under any 
system.  It's a tax on the poor, who really want to get rich.  
And that's the essence of this dynamics fluidity that you have 
alluded to.<p> 
 
		<b>SENATOR MACK</b>:  There are some statistical --<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  I think -- Matt -- John -- Dean -- 
Carroll -- Carroll had a question, Carroll Campbell.<p> 
 
		We've got Dick Armey waiting in the wings again, so we 
want to -- <p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER CAMPBELL</b>:  Senator, I think your point is 
right -- right, absolutely, on target when you talk about capital 
gains.  		There's no question that you discourage the 
investment with the tax; no question that people lock up their 
investment and sit on it.  There's no question that it hurts the 
flow of capital, and it has to be corrected.  	<p> 
 
		And I speak to this strictly from experience.  We, in 
the state of South Carolina, reformed the entire Tax Code, and we 
cut the capital gains tax, and we cut a lot of other rates.  And 
everybody said, "Well, we will go broke."<p> 
 
		It was just the opposite.  I just talked to my 
successor this last weekend.  And he said, "You're not going to 
believe it."  He said, "We had a $600 million surplus this year."  
And he cut the rates again.  <p> 
 
		That was an interesting -- it's an interesting thing.  
I don't think that people understand it.  	<p> 
 
		The point I'm getting to is we've got to get across to 
the American people that a capital gains tax cut is not for the 
wealthy, it's not for the rich.  It creates jobs, it unlocks 
capital, and it creates wealth in this country.  <p> 
 
		And we have suffered for years every time we raise the 
term "capital gains reduction" or "eliminate the tax," that all 
this is something for the rich.<p> 
 
		The best example that was ever given to me was a lady 
that started a small beauty shop, worked in it for years and 
years, and wanted to sell it.  And she found out that she was 
going to have to pay the tax on it, and the appreciation of that 
little piece of property.  The compounding up really had caused 
her to sit down and put pencil to paper.  And she found out that 
she really wasn't going to make anything out of it if she sold 
it.<p> 
 
		And she explained that to me in very simple terms.  And 
I think that's what has got to be explained to the American 
people.  <p> 
 
		But that's what's happening to us in our economy.  And 
I really appreciate what you've had to say to us.  I think you're 
very eloquent, and I hope a lot of people listen.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Jack Faris wants to start off -- of 
NFIB.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  Jack.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER FARIS</b>:  Mr. Leader, thank you for being 
here, and for going back and forth and making the votes.	<p> 
 
		Business owners, especially small business owners, feel 
like that they're -- they've become more tax collectors for the 
government than they have entrepreneurs.  Many of them would 
never start if they knew the threats that they would have to 
being in business. 	<p> 
 
		We've heard from everyone today saying that "We want to 
sponsor growth and new job creation."  <p> 
 
		We know that basically happens on Main Street today.<p> 
 
		What is in your plan and proposal that takes -- that 
gives some relief to the small business owner who is chief cook, 
bottle-washer, accountant, everything, within the company, the 
business that they have, but wants to make life easier and more 
simple for them as the government's number one tax collector?<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  Well, Jack, I welcome that 
question.  And incidentally, I might mention I have an article 
that is coming out in <i>Policy Review</i> in the July issue that 
addresses the whole question of a national sales tax, because 
here I think is where the small business owner, particularly the 
retail merchant in America, really falls into harm's way with 
respect to this obligation of being tax collector for the state 
and making a life very complex and threatened.<p> 
 
		It is my contention that under a national sales tax the 
IRS will have a more complex job than it has today.  It will 
become a bigger agency, and it will become a more aggressive 
agency as they walk into every retail store in America, ask to 
check your inventories, check your sales receipts, check your 
purchase orders, and "Let me see if you're doing my job good 
enough to suit me."  And I think that's going to be a terrible 
experience.<p> 
 
		The flat tax says, to the small business owner, "You 
can take your inventory expenses at the time of purchase.  You 
can take your investment expenses at the time of purchase."  <p> 
 
		You have, then, in terms of the complexities of your 
Tax Code, two items of relief in terms of how you handle 
inventory and how you handle capital investment.<p> 
 
		We will allow you to deduct any normal necessary 
business expense.  And after you deduct that expense and reduce 
yourself to your net earnings, you pay a simple flat rate, which 
is the same rate that we apply to anything.  <p> 
 
		And the important thing about the flat tax, as I 
envision it, is that you capture every dollar of income earned in 
the Nation and tax it one time with a single flat rate, whether 
it be earned through business enterprise or through individual 
enterprise.  <p> 
 
		And, of course, that can only apply to net earnings.  <p> 
 
		I believe the complexity of the Code, as faced by the 
small business, will be less than it is today.  Unfortunately, we 
can find no way to give any business enterprise a code that will 
be as simple as that for the individual.  <p> 
 
		The business owner may, as we work out -- and I might 
say, by the way, we do have a team of people that are working on 
transition rules, and I think the transition rules must be 
premeditated.  They can't be worked out at the <p> 
 
11th hour.  <p> 
 
		They've got to be thought out, because if you read <i>The 
Showdown in Gucci Gulch</i>, you'll find out the transition rules is 
where all the mystery was done in '86.<p> 
 
		But as we examine that, one of the things we have to 
focus our attention on is the peculiarities of transitioning for 
-- especially the small business.<p> 
 
		(Pause)<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Dean Kleckner was the next, and then --	<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER KLECKNER</b>:  Mr. Armey, I'm a farmer from 
Iowa, president of the Farm Bureau.  I also on the National 
Economic Commission with Senator Domenici back in -- seven years 
ago, in '87, '88.  <p> 
 
		We were established at that time to be a cover for a 
tax increase, which we didn't recommend, kind of shocked some 
people.  But I think most commissions -- although we're not an 
official government commission like the NEC was -- are put in as 
a cover to do something.<p> 
 
		Have things changed?  That's my first question.  Have 
things changed today in the country that commissions and groups, 
study groups, that you're really interested in what we say?  Or 
is it predetermined and that we're in general a cover for 
something?<p> 
 
		The second one -- more direct, a follow-up with Jack 
Faris' question, and Ken Blackwell's earlier -- I guess where you 
came back on capital gains tax.  Farmers are -- have tremendous 
value in the increases in value, largely inflation increases.		<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  Right.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Right.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER KLECKNER</b>:  How will -- and farmers aren't 
be sold today as a result of that, so the government -- 28 
percent of nothing is less than 14 percent of something would be.  
		But how will the capital gains increase when tremendous 
values of farmland are sold, and triple probably or quadruple 
values are then accumulated from when they were bought 30 years 
ago?  <p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  Let me first talk about cover.  We 
have at least three -- well, four -- at least four very good tax 
proposals that are being talked about in the Nation today, the 
Nunn-Domenici proposal, Bill Archer's emphasis on the national 
sales tax, my own iteration of the flat tax, and then we have 
Senator Specter with a different iteration of the flat tax.  
These are complex and difficult issues.<p> 
 
		In my judgment, nobody that advances these issues feels 
any qualms about the standing of their personal political 
popularity with America.  I can tell you I don't need any cover.  
I'm afraid that somebody in America may not notice that I should 
credit for the flat tax.<p> 
 
		So, I mean, certainly there's nobody seeking cover in 
this venture.  But I do think the Majority Leader of the Senate 
and Speaker of the House said these are complex ideas, they're 
all good ideas.  How do we sort through these ideas?  <p> 
 
		And we need to find people that have a proven, 
demonstrated expertise, background, and understanding that will 
have the time and the ability to sort through these ideas and 
make us a recommendation.  <p> 
 
		I don't consider that the search for cover as much as I 
see that as the search for a rational decision-making process.  
The fact of the matter is the Speaker is a very busy person.  The 
Majority Leader of the Senate is a very busy person.  <p> 
 
		The complexity, as you will learn, is so varied and 
diversified, they need your advice.<p> 
 
		Capital gains -- if I -- and let me just say, if I were 
-- this is going to be a fun statement.  I'll only get to say 
this once in my life.  If I were a farmer in Iowa, I would love 
Dick Armey.  And why do I say that?<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Are you running for something?	<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  No. I'm just saying that -- I think 
there are one or two farmers in Iowa that don't love Dick Armey.  
(Laughter)<p> 
 
		But still -- but in terms of tax reform and the flat 
tax, capital gains gets treated properly.  It's zero capital 
gains.<p> 
 
		We have a nomenclature with respect to capital gains 
today that I find personally difficult.  <p> 
 
		We talk about reducing the capital gains tax rate.  And 
inevitably somebody will talk about a preferential capital gains 
tax rate, and that just burns me up, because what, in fact, we're 
talking about is a less prejudicial capital gains tax rate.  <p> 
 
		Without basis adjustment for inflation, we have people 
paying capital gains taxes on capital losses.  <p> 
 
		And -- I think Carrol Campbell just related a story -- 
the fact of the matter is we zero capital gains, and that 
provides an enormous confidence that I can make an investment, 
take the risk.  And if it proves out and I have success, I can 
realize the benefits of that success.<p> 
 
		The other thing that I think is and should be of 
particular interest to the American farmer is the inheritance 
tax.  We do away with it.  My own view is that the federal 
government of the United States should not be the world's largest 
grave robber. <p> 
 
		But if you think of a farm family, you struggle in that 
farm, you work and you work and you build maybe some value, and 
maybe it accumulates over the years, and you manage to eke out a 
living on the farm and you've taken your son and your daughter, 
and you've sent them to school, and every year of your life you 
just got by, by putting another maintenance job on the old car, 
and so on down the line.  <p> 
 
		And then all of a sudden on one day you die, and those 
children of yours get assaulted by the government because they're 
king for a day.  <p> 
 
		On one day, the day of my death, my kids get to be 
rich, and the government comes and takes half of it away from 
them.  That's very little incentive.  <p> 
 
		And I have to tell you, if I'm given the choice between 
working for the financial well-being of the federal government 
and that of my children, I'll work a lot harder for the financial 
well-being of my children, and I'll build more and I'll build 
bigger, and I'll build more successful because of my children.<p> 
 
		Capital gains is another case where you're king for a 
day.  You just barely made a living off the farm for 30 years and 
then you sell the farm, and all of a sudden, you find yourself in 
the upper 1 percent of the income strata and somebody to be 
disdained, right?   And then we take it away.  <p> 
 
		And then, whatever you've got left after the government 
has taken their capital gains hit on you is what you've got to 
live off for the rest of your life when you go back to being a 
poor boy, you know.<p> 
 
		And these treatments I think are abusive and, quite 
frankly, not only -- it's a typical case of adding insult to 
injury.   <p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  They've heard about you in California, 
too.  Matt Fong has a question -- State Treasurer of California.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER FONG</b>:  Earlier, before you made your 
presentation, we heard from Chairman Archer and Senator Nunn.  
Both focused on one element, saying that it's very important for 
this new tax policy to have notice to address the issue of the 
global economy.<p> 
 
		What I found interesting, <p> 
 
Chairman Archer professed that he was originally, some time ago, 
before, in favor of the flat tax, but now stated that he did not 
think that the flat tax properly addressed the global economy.<p> 
 
		And Senator Nunn talked us through a very quick example 
of how the value-added tax gave a European -- and he used the 
example, a European manufacturer -- a competitive advantage over, 
say, an American manufacturer who has to incorporate his income 
tax into his price overseas.  <p> 
 
		So, can you address that issue?<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  Yes.  And this is a serious issue, 
and I've tried to give it serious thought, the question of border 
adjustability.  <p> 
 
		I take a generalized lesson about economics and public 
policy in this, that if you want to correct something, you don't 
do it by distorting the price system.  <p> 
 
		I think you can apply that principle to rent subsidies, 
or you can apply to agriculture policy.  You can apply it in any 
number of different ways.<p> 
 
		But what you're doing with these various forms of 
border adjustment is essentially you're dumping in the 
international tax market through the Tax Code by saying to 
foreign purchasers, "You can by American-made products at a lower 
price than what American purchasers buy."  <p> 
 
		I, frankly, don't think that's particularly fair to the 
American consumer.  <p> 
 
		And I am admonished by Adam Smith to remember that the 
ultimate end of economic activity is consumption, and to the 
effect that the government intervene in the affairs of the 
economy, it should do so on behalf of the consumer, not the 
producer.<p> 
 
		So, my own standard, it doesn't meet the public policy 
test of what is the national interest.<p> 
 
		So, I have these reservations about it. But I think -- 
more importantly, I don't think it will work.  I don't think 
you're going to correct an imbalance of trade.  <p> 
 
		As long as a nation remains dependent upon 
international capital sources to finance their investment, you're 
going to have to have a deficit in the current account in order 
to have a surplus in the capital account.<p> 
 
		Now, what does capital gains do -- or, I'm sorry, what 
does the flat tax do?  T<p> 
 
		The flat tax liberates American saving and investment 
for American investment, makes us less dependent upon foreign 
investment, and allows, then, the natural increased productivity 
and efficiency of a growing American economy to set straight this 
balance of trade.  <p> 
 
		But that becomes, then, another dilemma, because 
economies that grow faster will always have trade deficits with 
economies that grow slower.  And so you're blessing becomes your 
curse.<p> 
 
		Now, the thing that I think we ought to finally end up 
with, looking at this, while we bother ourself -- first of all, I 
believe governments have an inherent ability to bother themselves 
with things that are none of their own business.  <p> 
 
		Their lack of restraint is that they are fundamentally 
an institution that exists for the purpose of tending to other 
people's business, and they don't have any sense of discipline 
about it.  <p> 
 
		(Laughter)<p> 
 
		But international trade transactions are not 
transactions between governments.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  That's right.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  They're transactions between 
people.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Absolutely.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  So, why should the federal 
government --<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Right on.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  -- tip the terms of trade against 
the American citizens?<p> 
 
		So, it strikes me that it is a misguided policy and one 
that is not likely to work out very well in the first place.<p> 
 
		And I frankly, because of this, have very little 
obsessive concern about border adjustability except insofar as I 
have some fear that somebody will actually bite on it and enact 
it.	<p> 
 
		I probably have said more than a prudent man should.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  No.  This is so important, and all of 
us are sitting up here nodding our heads when you said that trade 
is not between governments, it's between people.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  Mm-hmm.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  And it's the freedom of an individual 
man or woman to purchase anything they want in a marketplace that 
you are defending.  And that is what the classical liberal 
tradition is.  I didn't mean to comment on it, but I was just 
saying the irony.<p> 
 
		We're sitting here, and the President of the United 
States is going to slap on -- who knows if they're going to make 
a last-minute agreement, but he's going to slap on a hundred 
percent tariffs on a certain product that will deny the American 
people the opportunity to purchase. 	<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  Right.	<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  They said, "Well, they shipped it to us 
last year."  		<p> 
 
		Well, they didn't ship it to us without somebody making 
a choice in a marketplace freely without any cohesion to buy that 
product over someone else's product.  And that's called freedom.  
And that's why you're here.  	<p> 
 
		Ken Blackwell wants to ask you something.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER BLACKWELL:</b>  If I just might make --	<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  That's what your book is all about.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  I believe that it is possible today 
for you to find a good book that will help you to understand that 
border adjustability.<p> 
 
		It swims against the tide of the freedom revolution.  
And we have to work on that a little bit --<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  What -- who's the publisher, Dick?<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  Rennery (phonetic).<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Henry Rennery.		<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  I'm probably out of line for even --<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Where can we get it?<p> 
 
		<b>PARTICIPANT</b>:  Any bookstore.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  Oh, I'm sure at any bookstore.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Any bookstore.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  I'm sorry, I -- 	<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  You and Newt -- you and Newt Gingrich.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  I indulge myself at your expense, 
and you're very tolerant of me.	<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  You and Gingrich are so shy about 
hawking your book.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  (Laughter)  I'm not.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Ken Blackwell.		<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER BLACKWELL</b>:  Representative Armey, as I 
understand your proposal, it does more than just simplify rates.  
It positions all income as either income to capital or income to 
labor.  <p> 
 
		Now, there are critics who would say that under your 
proposal dividend income is exempt.  <p> 
 
		How do you respond to a proposal that we allow for a 
personal consumption allowance on labor income and then just deal 
with all income, whether to labor or to capital, exactly the 
same?<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  I appreciate that question.  <p> 
 
		Now, this is so -- we have so many fictions in what I 
call "the mythology of fairness in America."  And one of these 
fictions is the distinction between earned and unearned income.  <p> 
 
		First of all, no production takes place without some 
component combination of capital and labor.  We have, then, land 
in with capital.<p> 
 
		In fact, we have a very famous Democrat -- Senator -- 
named Senator Douglas that invented something called the "Cobb-Douglas Function," that showed you 
must have these combined so 
that you can provide a resource to the production process in the 
form of your labor or your capital.  And nobody will provide 
either unless they get some return on that provision.  	 
	I am not working for no pay, ladies and gentlemen.  I'm 
sorry, I'm not going to do it.  Nor am I going to make my capital 
available to you for no pay.  That's not selfish; that's just 
good sense.  I've got responsibilities to my family.<p> 
 
		So, what happens is the owners or the providers of 
capital generally become the owners of the business.  And in a 
large complex system of equity ownership as we have, they become 
stockholders.  Stockholders' share of earnings is dividends.  	<p> 
 
		What the flat tax does in its effort to capture every 
dollar's worth of earnings and tax at one time says, "We will tax 
those earnings generated by the capital component at the source, 
one time."<p> 
 
		So, when the business distributes dividends, it 
distributes after-tax earnings to the owners of the corporation.  
And so it seems to me that the fiction that somebody escapes 
taxation is without foundation.  <p> 
 
		Now, they'll boil this down to:  "Well, what happens if 
somebody inherited all his wealth?"  I always love this when 
Senator Rockefeller raises a point with me.  "That's not fair."<p> 
 
		You know, what can I say about that?  Some -- I mean, I 
didn't chose my parents so wisely from an economic point of view.  
They didn't have -- they weren't rich.  I mean, I thought I made 
a good choice in terms of their common sense and their good 
stewardship as parents, and I was lucky.  But some people are 
just lucky, they're born rich.<p> 
 
		I don't know what you're going to do about that.  I 
guess we can hate them forever.  But you don't do any economic 
good in the Nation by saying, "All right, therefore we must then 
punish you for your good fortune."<p> 
 
		What are you going to do with a basketball player?  
Gets a contract for <p> 
 
$5 million.  Now, I can't dribble a basketball.  I can dribble a 
football.  <p> 
 
		(Laughter)<p> 
 
		Nobody is going to pay me for playing basketball, but 
shall we --<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Footballs are not supposed to be 
dribbled.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  I know that, but I can do it.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Wrong.<p> 
 
		(Laughter)<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  But in any event --see, this, to 
me, falls clearly under the category of jealousy, envy, and 
frankly, I think, greed.  And it is not the better part of our 
American disposition to get fascinated by that.	<p> 
 
		Now, about the flat tax and going back to our failure 
in '86, I have to tell you, you must, then, accept this 
proposition.  It is fair to capture every dollar earned in the 
tax base and treat it all the same, with a single rate for all.<p> 
 
		And my motto is:  Stay flat or die.  When you start 
making exemptions, exceptions, you know, whether it be for the 
honorable motive of giving advantage to something you think is an 
honorable activity or for the what I consider dishonorable motive 
of punishing somebody because they happen to have some good 
fortune -- most often born out of your hard work, by the way -- 
then I think what you're going to do is destroy the simplicity 
and the honesty of the Code.  	<p> 
 
		And then, I could say, "Well, you take anybody that has 
over $500,000 a year annual income, irrespective of whether they 
earned their education it or inherited it, and punish them."  
Now, why?<p> 
 
		So, I know we have these detractors, but I think it is 
detractors that come from people that don't understand the 
purpose of a Tax Code.  <p> 
 
		The purpose of a Tax Code is to raise money to finance 
the government at the minimal imposition on the American people.  
It is not to create an equality of outcome or to somehow or 
another exercise that frankly can only in its bottom line be 
described as a bold-faced prejudice.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  We're going to close up at 1 o'clock.  
So, let's get some questions.<p> 
 
		John Wieland.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER WIELAND</b>:  Mr. Leader, thank you for being 
here, and thank you for spending so much time with us.<p> 
 
		I am a homebuilder and realtor, and I am also the 
chairman of the Heard (phonetic) Museum of Art in Atlanta, so 
exemptions are very dear to my heart.<p> 
 
		How are we going to be able to protect all the 
Americans who have invested in homes and made a 30-year decision, 
you know, based on the existing Tax Code?  How are we going to be 
able to encourage home ownership, which we all believe is the 
bedrock of, you know, much of our culture?  <p> 
 
		And I hate to think that Americans aren't generous, but 
I think that there is some correlation between the deductibility 
of charitable contributions and the willingness to give.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  There's a lot of anxiety about 
this.  And one of the things I would ask, too, one must always 
look at if, in fact, you find yourself living in a world where 
you have a special break or opportunity or advantage, such as a 
mortgage interest deduction, and it's precious to you, as it is 
to our homeowners today, you're going to have an obvious anxiety 
about living in a world where that special opportunity doesn't 
exist, but yet that's what I ask you to do.  <p> 
 
		Don't think about being in this world, of this Tax 
Code, without the home mortgage, because I, too, would fight 
that.  Think in terms of a whole new world, called the "Flat Tax 
World," where there's a growth, a growing opportunity.  <p> 
 
		Recognize, if you will, to my shock, less than 25 
percent of American homeowners take the home interest mortgage.  	<p> 
 
		I would argue that the -- incidentally, what I consider 
to be the second most important American Dream, to own your own 
home -- the first being to get your kids out of it --<p> 
 
		(Laughter)<p> 
 
		-- the American Dream, to own your own home, is 
prompted by impulses that are so far greater in your life than 
the Tax Code.  People aren't going to quit buying homes if we 
have a new tax world without that exemption.<p> 
 
		And I would suggest that when you look at what happens 
with interest rates -- and everybody agrees, even DRI, that did 
the study for the realtors, agrees the interest rates will go 
down, you get a compensation to the homeowner in terms of their 
affordability of a home.  <p> 
 
		When they have a more certain understanding that they 
will more certainly have a better job with a greater opportunity 
for a promotion and advancement in a growing economy, and they 
make that life decision on what home to buy or when and where to 
trade up.<p> 
 
		I have to tell you, if I were a realtor today, if I 
made my living out of home real estate transactions, I would pray 
for the "Flat Tax World," where I had  a growing economy, where 
more people had better jobs, with a more certain understanding 
I'd get my promotion and my pay raise and lower interest rates, 
and I know I'd sell more, better, bigger homes.<p> 
 
		But one must first, it seems, extricate oneself from 
one's own worst fears.  And that is a tough thing, because the 
flat tax is not a revision of the existing Tax Code.  The flat 
tax is a new tax code in a new world.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Herman Cain.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER CAIN</b>:  Congressman, thank you for being 
here.<p> 
 
		One of several of our presenters in the course of our 
meetings have brought up the issue relative to the flat tax 
proposal, the issue of investing in human capital.  <p> 
 
		As I understand it, under the flat tax proposal, it's 
basically revenue, amount of expenses, mostly in terms of 
financial capital, et cetera, human capital being how do we 
invest in the development of the human capital side of the 
equation long term with respect to growth.  How would you respond 
to that?  	<p> 
 
		And if I'm not mistaken, the flat tax approach, with no 
deductions, does not directly invest in human capital, or does 
it? <p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  The first thing you need to 
understand is a flat tax says that if there's going to be a 
public program in support of education, job training, that should 
be done on the expenditure side.<p> 
 
		But the Tax Code is about raising money.  And so I 
would say that the human capital question is not a question for 
the Tax Code, and it is a function.	<p> 
 
		But if I may, governments, I think, do particularly 
poor jobs of investing in human capital.  Government-sponsored 
training programs and so forth generally don't work out too well.<p> 
 
		I have a great deal of affection for the machinists in 
America.  They work together, and they are pushing an encouraging 
-- and getting very little support from any government entity -- 
a whole system of apprenticement.<p> 
 
		A young person going on a job, learning that job from a 
person who has been on that job, who knows they're going to work 
with and rely on that person beside them on the job, is going to 
learn the job and learn it right.<p> 
 
		Mike Berg, who didn't have an eighth grade education, 
taught me my job as an apprentice lineman when I was going to 
college.  And he was concerned, because if he's sitting on a pole 
and he hollers for a come-along, and I send him a coffin hoist, 
I've made his day worse off.  It was very important to him that I 
learn his job right.<p> 
 
		Government programs for human capital, in my 
estimation, become slush buckets for providers of human capital 
training.  So, I have a wariness about those programs.<p> 
 
		But what do we do with the Tax Code -- with the flat 
tax?  <p> 
 
		We say to the American family <p> 
 
wage-earner, "We will make it maximum possible for you to 
maintain for your own family's use, with a generous family 
allowance to begin with and then a low marginal rate, the maximum 
amount of your earnings."<p> 
 
		"And then, Mom and Dad, you decide what's the best 
school for your children, where is the best college for your 
children, what is the best training program."  <p> 
 
		And I dare say that in your pizza shop you probably, 
without any assistance from the federal government, have done a 
much better job of teaching youngsters the disciplines of 
workmanship, what Thorstein Veblen calls "the spirit of 
workmanship."  These things truly are learned by young people as 
they grow up.  <p> 
 
		And I hate to use the word "boondoggle" -- but I dare 
say that if I were going to use that word, I would probably be 
talking about government-sponsored program of investment in human 
capital.  So --<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Any last minute questions?  Shirley 
Peterson.  And then Education Feulner.<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER PETERSON</b>:  Congressman, thank you for 
being here today. <p> 
 
		I find many aspects of your proposal; very attractive.  
There's one aspect of it, however, that worries me.  As a former 
tax administrator, I have a concern about compliance.  <p> 
 
		And I am concerned that compliance would drop 
precipitously if we did not have withholding.  And I would like 
to hear your views on that subject.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  Well, this is a -- it's probably 
the most controversial and <p> 
 
high-risk part of my proposal, and you'll find it probably in 
nobody's proposal.  <p> 
 
		The flat tax is, in a general sense, a Tax Code that 
bets on the goodness of the American people and not the guile of 
the federal government.  <p> 
 
		And it's a Tax Code, as I've envisioned it, that says 
to America, "We're going to give you a simple, direct, and honest 
bill for the size of big government and let you see as clearly as 
possible what it's costing you, because we bet that if you know 
how much it's costing you, you will vote for less big 
government."<p> 
 
		Now, in my scheme, I say to America, "We're not going 
to have a system of withholding.  We're going to ask you to sit 
down at your kitchen table the first of every month, and as you 
write your bills to here, there, and everywhere and you look at 
your Penney's bill and wonder, 'Did I get money's worth,' when 
you look at your rent bill or your mortgage payment and say to 
them, 'Am I getting my money's worth,' then you will write a 
check to Washington, D.C."  <p> 
 
		And you'll realize that "This is more than I paid for 
food, shelter, and clothing combined, and I wonder if I'm getting 
my money's worth?"	<p> 
 
		I think that's a healthy question for the American.<p> 
 
		Now, people say, "Well, Americans won't pay."  <p> 
 
		With all the enforcement power of the federal 
government, why would the same person who doesn't dare not pay 
their Penney's bill turn around and say, "But I'm not going to 
pay my IRS bill"?<p> 
 
		And I'll remind you what I had said earlier, there are 
many, many people in the world with whom I would pick a fight.  
The <p> 
 
IRS is not one of them. <p> 
 
		(Laughter)<p> 
 
		So, I honestly don't.  <p> 
 
		On the other hand, I think if a people say, "I got a 
fair, direct, honest bill that treated me the same as everybody 
else.  I know what my share of the cost is, and I can quickly 
compute what my neighbor's share is.  I know he's got to pay it," 
I think the goodness of the American people would come out, and 
compliance becomes less of a problem.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  But before we give <p> 
 
Ed Feulner the last question, I'd like for the press to know and 
our television audience to hear that we're taking this on the 
road.  	Bill Archer suggested that we do that in order to 
maximize the impact of the tax reform movement on the American 
people.  <p> 
 
		And we're going to be holding hearings in Boston; 
Omaha, Nebraska; Charlotte, <p> 
 
North Carolina; and Silicon Valley, California <p> 
 
-- among other things.		<p> 
 
		I told Charlie Rangel that I would like to see us maybe 
go into East Harlem or "Bed Sty" and talk about the particular 
problems of minority entrepreneurial-minded men and women. <p> 
 
		Matt Fong and I have talked about going into Watts and 
East L.A. to talk about minority entrepreneurship, but that is 
subject to the decisions to be made.  	<p> 
 
		But, Dick, we want to thank you so much for --<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  May I make a point?<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  -- your pedagogy. <p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  One point, Herman Cain, apparently 
I did not understand your question properly and went off on one 
of my tirades.  <p> 
 
		One of the things that I think will happen in a flat 
tax world is charitable contributions will go up.  We saw this in 
the '80s.  We reduced the tax value of a charitable contribution 
enormously in the '80s and, frankly, I might add, confounded it, 
so that you can't make a charitable contribution without a tax 
lawyer these days.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Mm-hmm.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  50 percent of the American people 
do not -- or 50 percent of the charitable contributions are never 
taken on taxes, and yet charitable contributions more than 
doubled in the '80s.  And I think that that's where you get 
investments in human capital that really pay off.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Yes.<p> 
 
		?? Southern sounding:  I just might add that I do not 
propose or support government-sponsored human capital programs.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  Thank you.<p> 
 
		And finally, I --<p> 
 
		<b>COMMISSIONER</b>:  So, I want to point that out for the 
record.  That was not the intent of my question or the point that 
I was alluding to.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARCHER</b>:  Oh, I appreciate that.  I knew 
that all along.  <p> 
 
		If I may miss Jack -- and final out to Shirley 
Peterson, when you go on the road and you ask people, "How about 
withholding?  Should --or should we or should we not have it?" -- 
one of the things you're going to find people express in a rather 
assertive fashion:  "It's my money in the first place.  Why 
should the government take some part of my money before I even 
get a chance to see it?"<p> 
 
		There's a certain assertiveness about that.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Bill.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARCHER</b>:  This would be a good way to end 
it.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Yes.  That is a great ending.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  Thank you again.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  Dick, thanks.  Well done.<p> 
 
		<b>CONGRESSMAN ARMEY</b>:  Thank you.<p> 
 
		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP</b>:  World class. <p> 
 
		Thank you all for coming.  <p> 
 
		The Commission will close our public hearings and get a 
bite to eat and discuss our next meeting.<p> 
 
		Staff is welcome to join us as well.<p> 
 (Whereupon, the public hearing of the National 
Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform was adjourned.)<p>

<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  (In progress) -- of the College
World Series, when the great events in this country.  I
happened to be here, as the Mayor knows, during the
College World Series.  <p>

		It's also the home of the "Entrepreneur of the
Year," Herman Cain of Godfather's Pizza.  And it is
under his auspices -- or at least aegis -- that we have
convened in Omaha.<p>

		And I would like the Commission to start with
some opening remarks from Mr. Cain, then the Mayor.  <p>

		And then we will proceed to our first panel.<p>

		Herman, thanks for your hospitality.  And we're
delighted to be in Omaha, Nebraska.<p>

<center><a name="Cain"></a>WELCOME BY COMMISSION MEMBER HERMAN CAIN</center>
<p><center>
<Font size="-1"><a href="#contents">Contents</a></Font>
</center><p>

		<b>COMMISSIONER CAIN:</b>  Well, thank you, Jack.<p>

		I would simply like to say welcome to all of
the Commission Members who were able to make this
particular trip, because the schedule is somewhat tight
that our fearless leader has demanded in order for us
to get our job done.<p>

		And I am extremely proud of the fact that Omaha
was selected as one of the cities where we would have
one of our open hearings.<p>

		So, I simply would like to welcome all of the
Commissioners.  <p>

		I would like to welcome and thank everyone who
took time to attend today.<p>

		And I can tell you, from my own experiences in
attending the meetings thus far, that they have been
extremely interesting, extremely informative.  <p>

		And I am personally very optimistic about what
this Commission is today.  And today will be just
another step in being able to achieve, ultimately, what
our goal is.<p>

		So, as I indicated to someone earlier, when
they asked am I proud of the fact that we're having the
hearing here in Omaha, Nebraska, yes, I am -- very
proud.  <p>

		So, thank you, Jack. <p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Mayor Daub, thanks for joining
us and allowing us to be in your fair city.  It's a
pleasure to be with you.<p>

<center><a name="Daub"></a>OPENING REMARKS BY MAYOR HAL DAUB OF OMAHA, NEBRASKA</center>
<p><center>
<Font size="-1"><a href="#contents">Contents</a></Font>
</center><p>

		<b>MAYOR DAUB:</b>  Well, Mr. Chairman -- and I used
to recall having the opportunity to say that to you
when you were my conference chairman when we served
together in the House of Representatives, it's always
good to see you and greet a friend and former
colleague.<p>

		And say to each of you a special and warm hello
from all of the citizens of Omaha, Nebraska, to
indicate to you that we feel honored.  <p>

		Not only are we proud of Herman Cain and all
that he does to help make this a sparkling and happy
and productive place to live, but you help us, as he
does, shine the spotlight on our city and our state of
Nebraska, and indeed the heartland.  <p>

		So, we bid you good morning and a welcome for
this second public hearing for the National Commission
on Economic Growth and Tax Reform.<p>

		This is the heartland.  We're very proud of our
productivity.  And you'll be listening to individuals,
men and women, on a very, very heavy schedule, as Mr.
Cain pointed out -- a very demanding schedule here in
Omaha today -- that speak for a variety and diversity
of business and industry.  They come from Illinois and
Iowa and Nebraska.  <p>

		So, I think you've well chosen this spot to
bring people together from the heartland and from the
greater Midwest to assess their view of where we need
to be in the years to come.<p>

		I'd like to extend a special welcome to all
those witnesses that you will have and to the people
who come to testify today.<p>

		And, of course, Jack, as I said, to especially
welcome you back so soon, when you were here to, I
guess, gauge how well this city can host and complement
opportunities as complex as the ones that you are
undertaking.<p>

		So, thank you, personally, each and every one
of you, for the work you're doing, for economic growth
and tax reform in our country.  		Through these
hearings and your report, people will be able to air
their concerns, ideas, and recommendations to help
stimulate economic growth in our country and to help
begin a process of tax reform. <p>

		I think, in fact, there are two great
happenings that are underway right now in our country.  <p>

		The first, from a Mayor's point of view, is a
Congress that is striving mightily to get their arms
around a gigantic federal system and to reshape it to
return power to local units of government and
particularly to do so without unfunded mandates.  I
think that's very significant, at least from the point
of view of governance. <p>

		The second, I think, great happening in America
is the undertaking of looking at our Tax Code -- and I
commend the Senator from Kansas, our Senator, Bob Dole
and the Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, for this
idea -- and, Jack, again, for your leadership in this
second great happening -- to see if we can't speak to
the future.<p>

		So, it is a historic opportunity.  		
Here, in Omaha city government, we're trying to set an
example for other communities and other units of taxing
authority to find innovative ways to approach tax
reform and economic growth.  <p>

		We've set priorities in our 1996 budget here so
we can begin to lower property tax rates for our
citizens.  We're engaged in that <p>

right-sizing process, too.  This will allow us to set a
pattern for meaningful tax reductions over the next few
years.  <p>

		We've also been hard at work to promote
economic growth in the 48th biggest city in America.  <p>

		Yes, Warren Buffet said he likes Omaha because
everything works in Omaha.  <p>

		And Walter Scott, of our Keywood Industries
organization, said he thought maybe the right answer to
Eddie was that maybe it's just the water.  <p>

		But whatever the reason, we're very proud of
what <i>Fortune</i> magazine said in rating Omaha "the ninth
most likely place you'd want to go if you want to set
your business on the fast track."  <p>

		In the high technology industry, to find one of
those cities, world-class cities of the 21st century,
you want to look at Omaha as high in brains and
entrepreneurial talent and the work ethic and work
productivity of this general area.  <p>

		So, we're mighty proud of how we're doing in
attracting more business and stimulating growth and
providing an atmosphere that will attract new
businesses and entrepreneurs that will help us grow.<p>

		I am confident you will seize this historic
opportunity and challenge all of us, but in particular,
as we take a look at this idea, that we can shed the
notion of our current tax policy and look to adopting a
more relevant process that will take us more fairly and
squarely to our future.<p>

		So, thanks again.  <p>

		Welcome to Omaha.  And I hope that you'll find
this hearing as informative as I know all of us will.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Thanks, Hal.<p>

		<b>MAYOR DAUB:</b>  Thank you very much.<p>

<center><a name="Kemp"></a>INTRODUCTION BY CHAIRMAN JACK KEMP</center>
<p><center>
<Font size="-1"><a href="#contents">Contents</a></Font>
</center><p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Thank you.<p>

		I introduced Herman Cain, who needs no
introduction.  <p>

		We're so pleased to have on our panel and our
Commission the president of the American Farm Bureau,
Dean Kleckner -- and as the Mayor said, we're in the
heartland of America -- thank you, Hal -- in the
heartland of America, no more important issue than tax
reform, entrepreneurship, working, saving, investing,
building a business, building a farm, investing in your
family.  These are the issues that our Commission is
undertaking.  <p>

		We are particularly pleased, on this
Commission, to have Loretta Adams, an entrepreneur --
and impresario from San Diego, California; Jack Faris,
the president of the National Federation of Independent
Business, NFIB, one of America's -- if not America's
premier representative of small, independent working
entrepreneurs and men and women in this country.<p>

		John Wieland, a homebuilder, one of the
distinguished homebuilders from Atlanta, Georgia.	<p>

		Teddy Forstmann, the founder of Forstmann
Little and one of American's financiers.<p>

		Shirley Peterson, former Commissioner of the
IRS, whose recent article was so perceptive in
outlining the problems of the current Code and some of
the answers that we are seeking.<p>

		Matt Fong, on my right, is the Treasurer of the
State of California, one of the rising stars not only
on the political scene but among the state treasurers
of the country.<p>

		Ken Blackwell, State Treasurer of Ohio is not
here, nor is John Snow, the CEO of CSX, who is in
Europe.  But they'll be joining us.<p>

		This is our sixth opening meeting.  This is our
second field hearing.  We were in Boston, now Omaha. 
We're going to Charlotte and San Francisco.  <p>

		We're also going to hold some tangential
hearings in different inner cities of the country to
explore the nexus between tax policy and poverty and
the problems of <p>

low-income minority entrepreneurs.<p>

		So, we're going to the run the gamut.  We have
heard from Democrats and Republicans.  Last night we
heard from Warren Buffet.  <p>

		Today we've got three panels.  We're going to
try to keep them within the range of <p>

45 minutes, have a break of about 10 to 15 minutes at
around 10:30, close down around <p>

12 o'clock, maybe 12:15.<p>

		We're going to have a little press availability
and then some Godfather's Pizza thanks to Herman Cain.<p>

		(Applause)<p>

		Thank you fellow employees of Godfather's
Pizza.<p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		One of the nice things about being chairman is
that everybody is sending me books.  I just sit back in
my office and look at books and articles and papers.  <p>

		And, you know, it really is interesting,
because somehow taxes -- it isn't <p>

-- somehow, it is absolutely a fact, taxes touch every
aspect of our lives.  It alters behavior.  It modifies
people's acts.  <p>

		The most recent book sent to me was "Good and
Evil, the Impact of Taxes in the History of
Civilization."  <p>

		Now, that's quite a study, but it goes back to
the Genesis -- the Book of Genesis and Abraham's -- I'm
sorry, Joseph's advice to Pharaoh.		<p>

		One of my favorite quotes was sent to me the
other day from my youngest son, who majored in
economics at Wake Forest.  <p>

		And he said, "Dad, I think you guys are on to
something."  <p>

		That's a tremendous concession from my son,
Jimmy Kemp.  But he's 23 years old and playing football
and he wrote.  He sent me a little Xeroxed page from
Will and Ariel Durant's "Story of Civilization" and
"The Decline of Greece," democracy in the Greek period,
and it said -- and I quote:<p>

		"The assembly degenerated into a mob, rejected
all restraint, voted itself every favor, and taxed the
people to the point of crushing their initiative, their
industriousness, and their thrift.  And democracy never
rose again."<p>

		The question was asked this morning of me by
one of the press representatives, "Are you a
Republican?"<p>

		I said, in answering, "We're center right. 
We're democratic Republicans."<p>

		There has to be a party -- there has to be a
movement in this country devoted to making democracy
work for all people.  <p>

		And the purpose of our hearings is to hear men
and women who are interested in <p>

tabula rasa vis-a-vis the Tax Court and writing a new
one, as Bob Dole and Newt Gingrich charged us with, for
the 21st century.  	<p>

		We're not going to wait for the 21st century,
because we want to present our product by the end of
October, maybe the end of November, and allow Democrats
and Republicans to look at the product of this
Commission's hearings and deliberations and to be in
Omaha with you, Herman, and you, Dean, our fellow
Commissioners in the first panel, to carry out what Bob
Dole and Newt Gingrich said was to bring about a
flatter, fairer, simpler, lower, pro-growth Tax Code
for American entering the 21st century.  <p>

		So, we see ourselves in a sense as the Founding
Fathers.  Maybe if a constitutional convention -- not
to suggest that any one of us have the incredible
intellect of those incredible people.  But we want to
look at the Code with an eye on how this country can
work better in a post-Cold War era of tremendous
possibilities, tremendous and exciting possibilities.<p>

		Let me suggest that our -- invite the first
panel, who will make a presentation of a perspective
from business and industry.<p>

		I'm going to ask Frank Hayes, the president of
Hayes &amp; Associates; Leroy Thom, president of T&amp;L
Irrigation Company; J. William Henry, executive vice
president, First National Bank of Omaha; Richard
Abramson, president and CEO of Prairie Systems, Inc.;
Gerald Schenken -- Dr. Schenken is president of The
Pathology Center; and Jeff Renner, principal office of
the Freeman Company.<p>

		If anybody in the audience who would like to
present a question to the panel, we are going to take
questions, but we're going to take them written down. 
That isn't to inhibit anybody; it is simply to try to
provide a little order to what could be a chaotic
process.  <p>

		We want to hear people -- very important that
this Commission hear from citizen groups.  <p>

		Talmudic philosopher said, one time, "There's a
lot of wisdom in the world.  Unfortunately, it's all
divided up among the people."<p>

		We don't think that's unfortunate.  We think
that's the best way; that's how markets work.  We think
markets are efficient, and we're delighted, gentlemen,
that you would be here.<p>

		And I'm going to start with Frank Hayes,
president of Hayes &amp; Associates, and move down.  We
would appreciate your brevity, but nonetheless we want
to hear the synthesis of your approach to tax policy. <p>

		Mr. Hayes, thank you for being here.<p>

		<b>MR. HAYES:</b>  Thank you.<p>

		First of all, I'd like to thank everyone.	<p>

		I just want to thank the Commission for
inviting me to come and give my perspective. <p>

		When I -- when Herman -- I know Herman -- when
-- I call him Herman -- hopefully, he doesn't get upset
about that.  <p>

		But when Herman first talked to me about this,
I hadn't really thought about tax reform.  And he was
telling me that he was involved on the Commission and
wanted to know what my perspectives were.  And we
talked a little bit.<p>

		He said, "I think you'd be a good person to
come and talk before the Commission."<p>

		Just to give you a little bit of background,
just to give you some sense about where I'm coming
from, I'm a CPA by profession.  I am a former IRS
agent.  At one time I also worked with an international
accounting firm for a number of years as the head of
their tax department.<p>

		(Off-mike remarks)<p>

		<b>MR. HAYES:</b>  Oh, yeah, let me switch gears.<p>

		There goes the brevity. <p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  We'll decide that, Frank.<p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		<b>MR. HAYES:</b>  As I said, I was an IRS agent.  I
worked for an international accounting firm for several
years.  <p>

		And also, after that, I started my own
accounting firm in 1983, so I've been in business as
Hayes &amp; Associates for the last 12 years.<p>

		And in doing this, we've worked with some
businesses, individuals, corporations, <p>

not-for-profit organizations.  And all of those
particular clients are all concerned about taxes.  And
we spent an enormous amount of time over those number
of years trying to figure out how to cut taxes for
people.  <p>

		And I think my basic thrust on this whole issue
is that I think if there's a way to make things more
simple, more fair, and sort of take the tax aspect out
of making day-to-day business decisions, I think
everybody would become productive.<p>

		As an accountant -- and as you know, we do a
lot of a tax work -- so a lot of people would say,
"Sell, as an accountant, how can you advocate making
something simpler, when it might make you lose your
job?"<p>

		Well, I think, as advisers, as business
advisers, as CPAs, we can still be more -- we can be
more productive if we can divorce ourselves from having
to make decisions strictly on a tax basis.	<p>

		And as you said, Chairman Kemp, it touches
everything that we do.  And if there is a way for us to
change that, so that as we go day to day in our
individual life or in our business life, where we can
make business decisions and not tax decisions, I think
it makes everyone more productive.<p>

		I don't know exactly all the specifics of what
you've talked about as far as how you're going forward
with this.  Maybe you haven't formulated those yet.  <p>

		But one of the things that I think happens with
a business -- and we work with a lot of businesses --
people come into the office and they say, "Well, how
can I cut my taxes?  How can I cut my taxes?"  <p>

		And that's more -- the biggest decision that we
have to sit down and talk to them about.  And a lot of
people get very frustrated, because we have business
owners who invest in their business, they go out and
they buy new equipment, they renovate or rehab their
facilities.  And then, at the end of the year, they
say, "Well, can't I deduct that?"  <p>

		And we say, "No.  You have to capitalize it and
depreciate it."<p>

		So, the person -- and then you've got to pay
taxes on money you reinvested back in the business.<p>

		So, people say, "Well, I don't have any money. 
The money isn't there.  I put it all back in the
business.  How am I going to pay these taxes?"<p>

		So, I guess, in my way of thinking, I think if
there is a way, as a Commission, that you can formulate
some ideas that will allow business decisions to be
made more on an economic basis, as opposed to a tax
basis, I think you would go real, real far in making
things a lot more simple, and also creating more
productivity in the meantime.<p>

		And as an accountant, I feel like it would be
an opportunity for us, as advisers, to do a better job
of advising our business clients, instead of just
focusing on the tax orientation.<p>

		The other thing I'd like to say is, is that
there are some, I guess, adverse things I think I need
to say about tax reform.  And as I said, I think one of
them is that, as a CPA, it's obviously going to impact
our business.  So, no one in their right mind would
advocate doing something that's going to do away with
the revenue source for them. <p>

		The other thing I might say is that I'm
concerned a little bit about it -- and I would hope
that you guys consider this in your deliberations.  I'm
concerned about charitable organizations.  I feel very
strongly that charitable organizations do a great
service in this country.  <p>

		And to a large degree, at least in my
experience, some people make charitable donations
because they feel they can deduct them for tax
purposes.  Now, maybe that's not the main reason, but
in a lot of cases that's one of the reasons.  So, I
think there should be some consideration given to that.<p>

		Another thing that I think that has happened
with the Tax Code over the last several years -- and I
know, Chairman Kemp, you're very in favor of this -- is
enterprise zones.  And there are some tax incentives
that go with that.  		And I think whatever you do
there should be some kind of consideration given to
encourage, incent (sic), whatever you will, economic
development in depressed areas.  And the enterprise
zones have been a good way to do that, and you've used
the Tax Code to try to get that done.<p>

		So, I think if you do make it simpler, you
still should have those kinds of things incorporated in
your plan so that there is some incentive to invest in
economically depressed areas.<p>

		But in summary, I guess I would say that I'm
very much in favor of some kind of simplification
process.  I sort of come there.  I wasn't there.  I
wasn't there when I first heard about this, because of
the things I said earlier.  <p>

		But I think what it would allow us to do as
advisers -- and, also, would allow the business to do -- is make better decisions, better business decisions,
and get so much away from the tax implications and more
on the economic side.<p>

very much.     <p>

<p><center>
<Font size="-1"><a href="#contents">Contents</a></Font>
</center><p>

<center>PRESIDENT, T&amp;L IRRIGATION CO.</center>
<p>

		MR. <b>MR. THOM:</b>  Thanks to the Commission to having
me here.<p>

		I'm a small businessman, celebrating my
fortieth anniversary.  Our company is T&amp;L Irrigation,
Hastings, Nebraska.  We sell irrigation equipment in
all of the states and in 12 foreign countries.  And at
the present time, we have 200 employees. <p>

		We all know that taxes are too high.  And we
have structured taxes so they slow economic growth.  <p>

		And I'm going to give you some of my personal
experience.  <p>

		Tax forms need to be simplified.  In 1994, our
tax form was the size of a small textbook.  We put
approximately 500 hours of our own, in-house, preparing
it.  The CPA put 230 hours preparing it.  And I don't
think -- only one knew somewhat what we were doing, and
that was the CPA.<p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		I had to sign that, but I didn't know exactly
what I was signing, except -- you know.  		So, what
has happened is Congress has made the tax laws and
regulations so complex that it takes someone who
specializes in tax law, working full-time, to interpret
these laws and regulations.<p>

		We have to find some way to get it down,
simple.<p>

		The last time I was audited by the IRS, it took
13 months to get the audit over.  At the end of 13
months, they didn't find enough mistakes to pay for
their people that were at the office.  Plus, I don't
know how many hours my staff put in helping them with
the audit.<p>

		A lot of time -- and pretty much what Frank
says, a lot of time is spent by everyone to minimize
their taxes because of the current laws.  This time
would be better spent in making profit for the
business.<p>

		There are many changes needed to be made in the
tax law, but here are a couple of what I call someone
asinine things. <p>

		Depreciation laws need to be reformed so a
taxpayer can advantage of the deduction in his
lifetime.<p>

		For example, I am building a new office.  It
will be depreciated for 39-1/2 years.  I'll be 110 if
I'm lucky.<p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		My youngest son will be 75.<p>

		Now, that is one thing.  Another one is we have
a lot of people on the road.  We have truck drivers,
servicemen, and salesmen.  We only get to deduct 50
percent of their meals.  Isn't this a legitimate
expense of business?<p>

		Another one is laws requiring retirement plans
need to made simpler.  We need to encourage taxpayers
to save for their retirement.  The current laws are so
complex and the fees and the administration costs of
these retirement plans are so prohibitive that many
small businesses can't offer this program to their
employees.  <p>

		Now, we come to taxes.  At the present time,
the federal and state tax puts T&amp;L at 46 percent.  This
does not include real estate tax, property tax,
personal tax, sales tax, fuel tax, and so forth.  <p>

		Then we come to the most regressive tax, estate
tax.  T&amp;L already has paid 46 cents.  When I pass on,
my estate will pay 55 percent of the last 54, which is
30 cents, which means that it can total 76 cents of
every dollar that I pay (sic) goes to those two taxes,
which does not include that other list of taxes that I
had.	<p>

		Worst of all, this means that the family
business will need to be sold in many cases to pay the
estate taxes.  <p>

		In my case, I have two sons in the business,
and I'd like to keep the business in the family.  But
with the current estate tax, this may not be possible.  <p>

		This will be detrimental not only to my family,
but also long-term employees.  This is very true in the
family farm in our area.  <p>

		You know, a family farm in our area is from 640
acres to 4,000 acres of row crop.  Many times, so much
of this ground has to be sold to pay the estate tax,
that when the next generation takes control, the family
farm is too small to be profitable, and they lose the
whole thing.<p>

		So, in summary:<p>

			Simplification of taxes and forms.<p>

			Improved incentives of capital expenditure
to create more business.<p>

			Reduce the estate tax to help preserve
small business and family farms.<p>

			Reduce the maximum tax rate to encourage
expansion and economic growth.<p>

			Get the government off the business backs,
such as OSHA, EPA, and all the other regulations that
are needed.		<p>

		In closing, this is a little bit off the
subject, the problem is the government is spending too
much.  I feel the only way that you can reduce
government spending is across-the-board spending cuts
so all divisions of government are taking a cut.  <p>

		Government is unwanted partner in business.  It
only takes the cream, doesn't help the business, takes
all of the profits out, and feeds nothing back to make
it grow.		<p>

		Thank you much for the opportunity.<p>

		(Applause)<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Well, Leroy, you have spoken on
behalf of all of the Commissioners.  And I'm sure with
all due respect to our panelists, I just can't help but
mention, on behalf of the Commission, that you are
preaching to the choir.  This is why Bob Dole and
Newt Gingrich set up this Commission.  <p>

		And hang in there, Leroy.  Help is on the way.<p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		You speak for every small businessman and woman
in America.  We appreciate your testimony.<p>

for First National Bank of Omaha.<p>

		Bill, thank you -- or William, whichever you
would like to be called.<center></center>

<a name="Henry"></a><center>PRESENTATION BY J. WILLIAM HENRY<br>
EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENTFIRST NATIONAL BANK OF OMAHA </center>
<p>
<center>
<Font size="-1"><a href="#contents">Contents</a></Font>
</center><p>

		<b>Mr. HENRY:</b>  I thank the Commission for the
opportunity to testify in this important matter.<p>

		The First National Bank and its affiliates
operate community banks in four Midwestern states, with
total assets of approximately $6 billion, and we employ
just over 4,000 people.  We are a leader in
agricultural lending and equipment leasing.  <p>

		We are committed to Main Street, retail and
small business lending in our communities, and we are
one of the Nation's leading issuers of bank card and
processing merchant transactions.<p>

		Our effective tax rate is one of the highest in
the country for financial institutions.  It has, on
average, exceeded the statutory tax rate over the last
three years.  As of June 30, 1995, our effective
federal tax rate is 35.102 percent.  <p>

		We are not a company which seeks to avoid our
taxes.  We're a good corporate citizen, and we support
a simpler tax system in which everyone will pay their
fair share.  It is good for our country, our customers
as well as ourselves.<p>

		We believe in real, meaningful tax reform.  The
cost in financial management resources of complying
with the current federal Tax Code places a tremendous
burden on all business and weighs most heavily on the
smallest and most entrepreneurial businesses.  <p>

		The costs of taxes are, in and of themselves, a
highly regressive tax, taking a proportionately much
higher toll on small business than on large business. 
This is a problem.<p>

		Furthermore, the current Tax Code is filled
with exceptions, exemptions, alternatives, and offsets,
which tend to benefit bigger business, better equipped
to take full advantage of all potential tax benefits. 
This is also a problem.<p>

		From a banker's perspective, a simpler, more
cost-effective, and fairer Tax Code is going to help
our economy.  It will free capital and management
resources to invest in the future and produce more
jobs.  <p>

		It will also increase the demand for bank
credit, to help fund this investment.  This will
benefit banks; and through the laws of supply and
demand, it will benefit our depositors as well.<p>

		Tax reform really can be good for everyone, but
we encourage you to carefully consider two issues which
could undermine the very advantages you hope to create
through tax reform.<p>

		First, be careful how you tax financial
institutions.  There seems to be a perception among
lawmakers that banks are somehow special and difficult
to tax.  This is really not true.  Banks are
fundamentally like all businesses.  <p>

		We have raw material costs, manufacturing
costs, inventory costs, and gross margins.  Our only
real difference is that our raw material and our
finished product are dollars, as opposed to tons or
units.  <p>

		So, tax proposals which exempt investment
income from taxation have a problem with banks, since
they confuse our finished product with investment.<p>

		Bank deposits and bank interest income must be
treated as the raw material costs and rent receipts
that they are.  This is the only way to permit the
market to define bank income on an institution-by-institution basis.  <p>

		We strongly urge you not to succumb to the
temptation of using an arbitrary formula or simplistic
and inaccurate assumptions about market cost to mask
the issue.<p>

		Second, be aware of a growing national problem
being created by state taxation of interstate commerce
in intangible goods and services.  <p>

		This is not a federal tax issue.  This is a
federal issue.  The taxation of interstate commerce --
and it is the potential to severely undermine the
benefits of all federal tax reform.  <p>

		The core of the problem is that every state can
and should tailor its tax codes to its own unique
needs.  This exposes companies involved in interstate
commerce to double and triple taxation.<p>

		As more states become aware of their right
companies located in other states, they have begun to
seek back taxes and alter their codes to increase the
proportion of state tax which can be collected out-of-state.  <p>

		The costs of implementation, compliance, and
litigation are continuing to mount.  The effect on the
national economy of these costs and the immeasurable
cost of uncertainty about the future should not be
understated.  <p>

		This is not just a bank issue.  It involves
technology, communications, and services generally, and
it will affect our global competitiveness.<p>

		The 86th Congress recognized this basic problem
and forbid states to tax companies which have no
presence within their borders except sales
relationships.  <p>

		But in 1959, when the U.S. had a goods economy,
the protection provided was specifically limited to
tangible goods.  We now have a service economy, and the
interstate commerce in services and intangibles is not
covered by federal protection.  <p>

		The solution to this problem is simple,
congressional action to extend existing service to
services and intangibles, but the solution is
politically difficult for the federal government and
potentially expensive for state governments.<p>

		Unfortunately, the longer we wait to resolve
it, the more expensive and difficult it will become. 
We strongly urge the Commission to address this serious
problem in your report.<p>

		Thank you for letting me testify.  A copy of my
remarks are available for you.<p>

		<b>MR. ABRAMSON:</b>  Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
I really appreciate the opportunity here to come and
speak before the Commission and at the invitation of
the NFIB.<p>

		I am a small businessman here in Omaha, the
founder of a company by the name of Prairie Systems
that develops software for the high technology
industry, primarily telecommunications.  We're a five-year-old company and growing very rapidly very
recently.  We were given an award as "The Second-
Fastest Growing Company in Omaha."	<p>

		The Tax Code has a great impact on our business
and our need for capital.  <p>

		I also was the chairman of the White House
Conference on Small Business for the Nebraska
delegation that recently met.  And I can tell you that
taxation was one of the hottest topics at the White
House Conference on Small Business.<p>

		I would also tell you that Mr. Thom -- his
testimony very much reflects that of the small business
community that was represented there.  And I second
everything that he said.<p>

		The thing I believe that is encouraging here is
that there are a number of proposals out for tax
reform, and I really commend you for that.<p>

		The high, progressive tax system today
discourages savings and investment.  And that's the
aspect that I want to hit on today, because I've felt
the pinch of this.  And certainly that discouragement
of savings and investment seriously harms the economy
by reducing capital formation and investment in small
business such as mine.  <p>

		In my opinion, an ideal tax system does not
penalize or subsidize various economic choices. 
However, I think the current tax system does, in fact,
do that.<p>

		Unfortunately, one of the most destructive
elements of the current Tax Code is the multiple levels
of taxation on investment and savings.  <p>

		Just as savings, dividends, businesses and
other forms of investment income are penalized by
personal income tax, capital  formation is hindered by
corporate income tax, capital gains taxes, estate and
gift taxes, depreciation tax, and by corporative
alternative minimum taxes. <p>

		An example here is if a taxpayer, after he pays
his personal income tax, has $100 to do something with. 
One choice he can do is go out and consume that, spend
it on goods and services or vacations and haircuts, and
various things like that, and, with the exception of
sales tax, get about $100 worth of benefit from that
$100.<p>

		Alternatively, he can make a choice to invest
those dollars in a small business like mine or many
others that fuel the growth in this country.  In that
case, he takes the opportunity to create new jobs and
to spur the economy and create new products and
services.<p>

		If the company succeeds, the investor will
likely benefit from that.  Alternatively, he's put it
completely at risk, and that $100 may disappear.<p>

		In the example here, let's assume that this
investment does bear fruit and gets a 10 percent return
on that, which means that the investment yields $10 of
income for every $100 invested.  <p>

		Under the current Tax Code, 34 percent of that
is skimmed to pay the corporate income tax, leaving
only $6.60 out of that original $10.  <p>

		Let's assume that $6.60 then goes to the
investor as a dividend, but he then faces other taxes. 
Depending on the investor's income, the personal income
tax will take as much as 40 percent off of his $6.60,
leaving him less than $4 of annual income in this
successful investment that he made.  In addition, he
probably has some form of state and local taxes to pay.<p>

		Finally, if this investor decides to sell off
this stock, he now gets subjected to -- hit by one of
the highest capital gains taxes in the industrialized
world.  <p>

		And I think the White House Conference on Small
Business gave very large support to reduction or
elimination of the capital gains tax.<p>

		What little income he eventually receives from
saving and investment have taken <p>

-- it's a small return compare to the risk that he has
had to take to get it there.<p>

		To add insult to injury, as Mr. Thom has
pointed out, successful entrepreneurs who are trying to
accumulate an estate, then, to pass on to their
children face the possibility of 55 percent taxation on
those assets.<p>

		Thanks to the Tax Code, a fortunate investor,
one who actually earns money on his investment, may
have to send more than half of his earnings to the
government, not to mention having already paid taxes on
the money in the first place that he invested.<p>

		In my opinion, by punishing this savings and
investment, this Tax Code encourages businesses and
individuals to consume rather than save and to build
America.  <p>

		As a result, to small business owners like
myself, there is very limited capital available.  We're
a very high-growth business, and it takes a lot of
capital to grow at that rate.  <p>

		The results of investment, venture capital
kinds of firms demand a 50 percent annual return and up
on their investments in order to, first of all,
mitigate some of the risks that they've taken, but also
to return a decent profit to their organization after
all these taxes have been paid.<p>

		My business is ideal to that sort of venture
investment, and it's enormously expensive to build and
grow a small business with that.<p>

		I believe that a consumption-based tax, with
careful attention to the avoidance of this double
taxation, should be the goal of tax reform.<p>

		I think there's a real danger here, though, in
that the mechanism for getting from where we are to any
form of tax, but especially a consumption tax, I think
is especially ticklish.  And the worst of all worlds
would be to end up with both an income tax and some
form of an income (sic) tax.<p>

		And so in my opinion, a shift to a consumption
tax would require repeal of the 16th Amendment to get
rid of income tax.  <p>

		I do applaud the efforts of this Commission.  <p>

		The small business community is enormously
concerned about these issues.  It's long overdue that
we have tax reform in this country.<p>

PRESIDENT, THE PATHOLOGY CENTER</center>
<p>

</center><p>




		<b>DR. SCHENKEN:</b>:  Thank you very much, <p>

Mr. Chairman.  <p>

		And because of time constraints, I have
submitted some written testimony -- <p>

		CHAIRMAN MILES:  Sure.<p>

		<b>DR. SCHENKEN:</b>: -- which I hope you'd put in the
record for me.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Well, please be assured that
the written testimony will be passed along to all of
the members of the Commission, and it will be part of
our official record -- and also the Commissioners who
aren't here.  So, we appreciate that. <p>

		<b>DR. SCHENKEN:</b>:  Thank you very much.<p>

		It's a pleasure to be here.  <p>

		I'm president of a medical laboratory.  We have
about 210 employees.  We provide laboratory services
for doctors, patients, and hospital in western Iowa,
northwestern Missouri, and Nebraska.<p>

		As you may or may not know -- those of you are
involved in health care may know that while there are
probably some competitive problems out there in health,
that doesn't run over into the lab area, which has been
competitive for about 25 years.  <p>

		And we compete every day with multibillion
dollar organizations.  And I can tell you competition
is fun, but it's hard work.<p>

		About 50 percent of our employees are
professionally trained.  The majority of them are
female.  About 70 percent of our employees are from
two-income families.  And a significant number of our
senior managers are female and are the senior earners
in their families.<p>

		I bring this to you because I want you to know
the perspective from which I am going to raise some
issues.<p>

		Now, I have also been a former board member of
both the Nebraska and the Omaha Chamber of Commerce and
long-time member of the NFIB.  And twice I was elected
to the White House Conference on Small Business.  <p>

		And I have had the privilege of testifying
hundreds of times on issues relating to health or
economics or tax issues in front of Congress.<p>

		So, let me open my testimony by telling you
what I experienced.<p>

		1984, I believe, was the 10-year anniversary of
ERISA.  And there was a Labor Department hearing on the
thing.  <p>

		And I testified, and I said, "You know, health
was included in ERISA by accident," which I believe it
to have been. <p>

		And what happened was that because of ERISA's
exemption, we had one aspect of the health insurance of
the United States which was completely free of state
regulation, state mandate, state this, state that, and
left the insurance companies noncompetitive because
they all had all of the mandates, they had all of the
regulations, and so forth.<p>

		I'm not saying one is good or one is bad, but
this is just one of many examples in which the
discrepancies within these regulatory and tax --
ultimately tax codes did not jive and left small
businesses -- I'll tell you in a minute -- holding the
bag.<p>

		Now, basically I believe the problem to be that
there are huge numbers of incentives and disincentives
in the current tax law and code.  And as a doctor, I
could call them disordered, dysfunctional, and
destructive.<p>

		And my big call to you, as you simplify them,
make sure they go in the same direction and they help
businesspeople make business decisions to be productive
and create wealth and so forth, rather than going in
the other directions.<p>

		And I'm going to focus quickly on four issues
that relate to small businesses, my operation and
others:		<p>
<ul>
<li>Health insurance,
<li>The marriage penalty.
<li>Inheritance tax.
<li>And spending.
</ul><p>
		Health insurance -- small business has been
chided for not providing health insurance by people who
don't understand small business.  There are two real
reasons for it.  <p>

		One is we have not been able to create the type
of groups we need to.  That's another issue.<p>

		But the other has been that individuals and
small businesses have been prevented from having the
tax sheltering ability that normal corporations have.  	<p>

		I provide my employees through -- I'm a
professional corporation, and we provide them -- for
everybody.  But my small business colleagues, my farmer
friends, and so forth are penalized by the Tax Code,
and then they're penalized again because they have to
get individual tax policies.<p>

		And while I'm on health, I think we should
recognize one of your panel members, who is one of two
people -- I won't mention the other one -- but one of
the two people who stood up at the time when health was
about to be nationalized and said, "Small business
can't deal with this."<p>

		Thank you, Mr. Cain.<p>

		PARTICIPANT:  Here, here.<p>

		(Applause)<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  -- all by himself.  A lot of
help, but -- that was the beginning, in my opinion --<p>

		<b>DR. SCHENKEN:</b>:  He had one --<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  In my opinion -- editorial
comment here -- that was the beginning of the end to
the --<p>

		<b>DR. SCHENKEN:</b>:  That was it.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  -- nationalized health
insurance --<p>

		<b>DR. SCHENKEN:</b>:  That was it.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  -- more in America.	<p>

		<b>DR. SCHENKEN:</b>:  That was it.<p>

		And I was watching it on television --<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Electric night.<p>

		<b>DR. SCHENKEN:</b>:  -- and I turned to my wife and
said, "It's over."<p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  So did I.<p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		So did I.<p>

		<b>DR. SCHENKEN:</b>:  Yes.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  I said, "This is the beginning
of the end." <p>

		<b>DR. SCHENKEN:</b>:  Second, marriage penalty -- you
all know the marriage penalty within the Code.  I won't
mention it to you.  It is a big problem in the double-income families.<p>

		All three of my children are double-income
families and will be so even if they don't afford it --<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Right.<p>

		<b>DR. SCHENKEN:</b>:  -- because both halves have
career aspirations --<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Right.<p>

		<b>DR. SCHENKEN:</b>:  -- and things that they want to
do in life. <p>

		And I think you have to do that.  And the
biggest problem with the marriage penalty now is on the
benefit side, where most benefits are "Use it or lose
it."  <p>

		And that is one of the many reasons we've gone
to a cafeteria plan, self-insurance, so that our
husband-and-wife combinations can get equity between
the two jobs.  There are a lot of ways to change that,
but that is a big, big problem.<p>

		Third, inheritance tax -- I think <p>

Mr. Thom has done the job on inheritance tax.  I must
tell you it is not -- this is not a problem for
corporations with 200 employees.  It is for him.  But
it is a giant problem for small businesses,
restaurants, farmers, and so forth and so on. <p>

		And I must also say that just because we're
focusing on small business, our large corporate friends
need tax relief as well.  So, don't forget that there
are big people out there.<p>

		Finally -- and this is the problem -- and that
is, where you stand on taxes depends on where you sit. 
And everybody is anti-tax, but all surveys show that,
in spite of what they say, they are pro-services from
government.  And it's a very difficult line to walk.<p>

		I do not believe successful tax relief can be
attained unless there is something done about overall
spending, because overall spending will ultimately, as
I've said in my testimony, jurisdictional shifts of tax
burdens which will then create an entrusting populace.  <p>

		So, I would urge you, as you do this, to see if
we can figure out some sort of a tax limitation,
whether it's Gross National Product related, gross
state product related -- there are different ways to
go.  We need to do capping on the spending side,
otherwise nobody will trust you underneath it.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Right.	<p>

		<b>DR. SCHENKEN:</b>:  And to close on that and to
focus on the need of public education, my mother, rest
her soul, will forgive you for whoever spent my name
with a G.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Ah.<p>

		<b>DR. SCHENKEN:</b>:  Now, the person who did it
probably -- I think, knows me -- looked at my resume
for dozens of times where it says J -- her last name
was Jerald, that's where I got the name J -- and still
wrote G.  <p>

		And that's the same problem with the Tax Code. 
People have the fairness issue.  They have the "Tax the
other people."  They have the Russell Long "Don't tax
you, don't tax me, tax the man behind the tree." 
That's so in their mind that they will see things which
do not exist in taxes. <p>

		So, whatever you do, we need to have a very
strong --<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Well said.<p>

		<b>DR. SCHENKEN:</b>:  -- national program.  <p>

		Thank you, sir.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Thank you.<p>

		Jerald with a J.<p>

		Jeff Renner is the principal officer of The
Freeman Company.<p>

		We're delighted Mr. Renner and look forward to
your testimony.<p>

		Do you want to move.<p>

		<b>MR. RENNER:</b>:  Yes.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Jerald with a J.<p>

		On behalf of Jack, Joanne, Jeffrey, Judith, and
Janice, I agree with you.<p>

		(Laughter)<p>

PRINCIPAL OFFICER, THE FREEMAN CO., INC.</center>
<p>
<center>
<Font size="-1"><a href="#contents">Contents</a></Font>
</center><p>


		MR. RENNER:  Thank you, Chairman Kemp and
members of the Commission.<p>

		I'm a small businessman, also, primarily
engaged in banking and real estate.  However, I've also
had 15 years of experience in government.<p>

		You've heard an awful lot of reasons today why
there should be a major overhaul of the Nation's Tax
Code.  <p>

		But the single over-riding reason is this, that
the current Tax Code is an enormous waste of
everybody's time.<p>

		A Heritage Foundation study estimated that
Americans spend 5.4 billion manhours annually complying
with the Tax Code and with tax planning and record-keeping and tax return preparation.<p>

		And I saw a recent article in the Wall Street
Journal that estimated that the current Tax Code costs
our economy 6 billion hours annually.<p>

		So, I did some quick calculations.  That's the
equivalent of 10,000 lifetimes wasted every year.<p>

		According to the Tax Foundation, the compliance
costs for the federal income tax last year cost
American business alone $127 billion.  And it cost all
Americans $200 billion.  That's an amount equal to the
output of our automobile, truck, and aircraft
industries combined. <p>

		That time and effort and money did not educate
a single child, it didn't feed a single family, and it
didn't produce a single tangible product to improve the
life of anyone.<p>

		The main reason for this waste of time and
money is the sheer complexity of the Tax Code.  In its
present form, it's impossible for many Americans to
even comply with the tax laws simply because they can't
understand it.<p>

		I had the personal experience at one time of
being told by the government to handle a transaction in
a certain manner, only to be audited and later told
that it should have been done differently.  <p>

		Unfortunately, ignorance of the law is no
excuse for we American citizens.  But equally as
unfortunate, the ignorance of the law seems to be the
only excuse required of our employees.<p>

		Another focus of the Commission's work is the
basic principles and objectives that the reform plan
must embody.  And I would suggest that these are three: 
Simplicity, stability, and fairness.<p>

		A recent Andersen Consulting survey revealed
that simpler forms and filing instructions were among
individuals' top tax concerns.  And I saw another
survey that showed that over 70 percent of the college
graduates in this country can't compute their own
taxes.<p>

		Now, our Tax Code should be simple enough so
that an individual is able to prepare and file his or
her own tax return.<p>

		I'm one of those college graduates who can't
file his own tax return.  And last year it cost me over
$5,000 just to file my own personal tax return.  And
that's ridiculous.<p>

		The current complexity of the Tax Code leads, I
think, to this instability.  In an eight-year period,
we've seen six major tax bills pass the Congress.  <p>

		And these constant attempts to correct or fine
tune the Tax Code lead to more change and more
uncertainty, making it impossible for individual
Americans to meaningfully plan for their own future.<p>

		Americans need to be able to understand what
the Tax Code is and know that it's going to remain
reasonably stable.<p>

		Finally, the Tax Code must be fair, and this is
the most difficult term to define.  But we do know that
the current Tax Code pits organized special interest
groups with money and lobbyists against families with
children and limited resources.  They can't compete in
that arena.<p>

		The current tax compliance system costs small
businesses proportionately 10 times more than large
corporations, as Mr. Henry pointed out.<p>

		A fair Tax Code, I suppose, would be one that's
more uniform, that would tax all income without special
exceptions and loopholes, hopefully at a lower rate;
that it would tax all income the same way, regardless
of the source, and would tax it only once. <p>

		By eliminating the complexity and introducing
stability and fairness through uniformity, I think that
we, as a nation, can redirect our time and energy and
resources toward production and economic growth.<p>

		Thank you.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Great.  Thank you.<p>

		Thank all of you.  Very eloquent.<p>

		Herman Cain -- Mr. Cain.<p>

		<b>COMMISSIONER CAIN:</b>  Thank you, Chairman Kemp. <p>

		I want to direct my question.  I would like to
ask all of you the question, but time only allows me to
direct the question to just two of you.  <p>

		So, Mr. Renner and Mr. Hayes -- Frank -- I'll
direct it.<p>

		When I was asked to participate on this
Commission by Jack Kemp and Newt Gingrich, one of the
reasons I said yes, that I would participate, was
because the charge was not to come up with incremental
changes to a system that is as screwed up as all of you
have indicated, but to replace the current system.<p>

		And, Jerry, when you were talking about the
mind-set that we've got to break with the American
public in order to replace, which is a revolutionary
jump from where we are today, it's going to take a
couple of things:<p>

		One, there has to be a groundswell with respect
to the American public that will put the pressure on
the politicians to be able to make that leap.<p>

		My question is:  What, in your opinion, are
some of the things we can do to create the proper
groundswell that will give it the necessary momentum
that will cause the lawmakers to make the necessary
leap that we have to make if we all collectively are
going to be successful at replacing the current Tax
Code?<p>

		Yes.  Start with you, Jerry.  And then Frank.<p>

		<b>MR. RENNER:</b>  Well, we could spend a long time
or a short period of time.  I think I'll go short.<p>

		<b>COMMISSIONER CAIN:</b>  Okay.<p>

		<b>MR. RENNER</b>:  It is clear to me that when the
American public is given good information, they almost
always make good decisions.  <p>

		And I wrote a letter to Mr. Gingrich as soon as
the Congress changed this last time -- which I will
forward a copy to you -- and warned him that if we
balance the budget without the public's understanding
of tax policy and so forth, that we, the Republicans --
excuse me for doing that, but that's what I am -- would
end up suffering, because people would be critical of
stuff that was done properly because they wouldn't
understand it.<p>

		I believe what you are doing will do more than
any other single thing, but you have to not just go to
Omaha, Nebraska, you have to go to Cozad, Nebraska --
not necessarily you, but you could have subcommittees. 
But if people really understand things, I think we're
okay.<p>

		One example, look at all the people that
believe that they themselves have paid for their Social
Security benefits and their Medicare.  They actually
believe it.  And until they understand the facts,
they're not going to change it.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Frank Hayes.<p>

		<b>MR. HAYES:</b>  Yes.  Herman, I think, just to echo
what Mr. Renner said, it has to be understandable.  <p>

		And that's why I like the flat tax, because if
the average individual does not understand it -- and
right now nobody, pretty much, understands the Tax Code
unless you work with it every single day -- if you
don't get that understanding on the part of the average
individual, if you do not reach that as part of your
recommendations, then you won't, in my estimation, have
the groundswell of support, because people won't know
what they're for.  <p>

		So, it has to be something that is simple
enough that it's understandable to the average person.  <p>

		And if you don't get that, I doubt very
seriously if you're going to get the groundswell of
support, because nobody is going to understand it.  <p>

		And I guess that's what Mr. renner said, and I would just echo that.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Thank you.<p>

		<b>COMMISSIONER CAIN:</b>  Thanks.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Commissioner Kleckner.<p>

		COMMISSIONER KLECKNER:  Thank you, Jack.<p>

		Incidentally, we're in Omaha, Nebraska, but
right across the river is Council Bluffs, Iowa, my home
state.  	<p>

		So, Herman, do I have your permission to
welcome everybody --<p>

		<b>COMMISSIONER CAIN:</b>  Yes, Dean.	<p>

		COMMISSIONER KLECKNER:  -- all over Iowa?  <p>

		<b>COMMISSIONER CAIN:</b>  Yes.  Yes, you have my
permission.<p>

		(Laughter)  <p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  -- Iowa.<p>

		COMMISSIONER KLECKNER:  It's been a --<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Is there something going on in
Iowa that we ought to know about?<p>

		COMMISSIONER KLECKNER:  The corn is growing
good, and I sell -- I'm a corn and soybean hog raiser
and sell hogs.  And Herman buys some of them to put in
the topping of Godfather's Pizza that we're going to
eat this noon.<p>

		<b>COMMISSIONER CAIN:</b>  That's right.<p>

		COMMISSIONER KLECKNER:  You're going to be
eating my pork this noon from my farm in northern Iowa,
Jack.<p>

		This has been a great panel.  And small
business and farmers come next, and that's also small
business.  And that's the backbone of this country.<p>

		We're hearing about the mega, the Disney and
the ABC merger now.  But you know, the real jobs are
being created by the Herman Cains and all of you and
the small business.<p>

		Just a comment.  My farm -- I made -- Mr.
Hayes, I made tax decisions, as farmers still do,
rather than economic decisions.  The years we had the
investment tax credit by buying or not buying at the
end of the year.  <p>

		Now that we've lost income-averaging, farmers
and, I think, probably some small business, too, I'll
bet you Mr. Thom and his irrigation business, it goes
up and down some years.  But at least farmers have
tremendous shifts in income.  We've lost income-averaging.  We try to do it ourselves. <p>

		I do it by not selling hogs at the end of the
year, delaying till the next year, A lousy economic
decision, but a tax decision, and either buying or not
buying inputs in the first of the year to try to level
out my own income tax.<p>

		What, as a CPA -- and I presume you may do some
farmers' -- ranchers' returns, what do you -- how do
you assess this?  What do you do?  What do you think
should be done, for example, with the extremes of
income that farmers have?  How would you attempt to
level that out?  One or two things that you'd like to
see done to do that.<p>

		 <b>MR. HAYES:</b>  Well, it is a difficult question,
because whenever somebody asks me a question about a
particular tax issue, I always say, "It depends on the
circumstances."<p>

		And the reason that I say it, again, goes back
to the way the Code is structured, and that not
everyone fits the same idea or the same solution.<p>

		Not having income-averaging -- that went away
several years ago -- not having any kind of way to
balance your income out, I think it -- your question
really answers itself and that that's why you need a
simplification process.<p>

		I don't know if I can answer that question
specifically and say you need to do this or you need to
do that.  <p>

		But I think what you need to look at is say the
way the system is now.  There's almost nothing you can
do other than, like you said, delay the reporting of
the income until next year; spend as much money this
year as you can, even though you might not really want
to, it might not be the best thing to do.  But I think
simplification goes back to the answer.<p>

		If you know every single year -- when we do tax
planning, we sort of plan two years at a time.  And we
say, "Okay.  Let's look at a two-year span instead of a
one-year span.  And let's try to make as many good
decisions as we can within that two-year span to reduce
your tax burden."<p>

		What I would suggest is that if we go to a
simplified system, then that takes that decision out.  <p>

		I think one of the gentlemen said the amount of
money and effort and time that we spend in this, it
could be spent helping you make other types of
decisions that are going to be beneficial in the long
term, because I really think short-term -- tax
decisions are really short-term decisions.  And as a
businessperson <p>

-- and if you really want to be successful in business,
you have to make long-term decisions. <p>

		So, I think it's more or less tax
simplification is the answer.  I don't have any
specific recommendations that I can give you at this
point.<p>

million exclusion, and all taxes above that will be cut
in half from the current rates, which we are supporting
and applauding.  It's one of NFIB's targets for this
year.<p>

		How important is it to you, in our tax reform
look, to deal with estate taxes and to tax that day --
the capital gains tax the day you sell your business? 
How critical is that to you in terms of priorities for
us, in this Commission?<p>

		And I'd ask any of you who feel motivated to
answer that.<p>

		MR. <b>MR. THOM:</b>  Well, we spend a lot of time, since
my years is 70 years of age, trying to figure out how
we're going to be able to pass the business down.  And
many of our decisions are now made on that basis,
rather than on a good business judgment.  <p>

		And it's -- you know, I think estate tax is
more regressive than any tax that there is, because it
kills the goose that laid the golden egg.<p>

		And government -- it should be look at that. 
If you kill the goose, you get a big chunk right then,
but you don't get any from then on.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Jerald, do you want to make a
comment? <p>

		<b>DR. SCHENKEN:</b>:  Yes, a quick comment. <p>

		Professionals, by and large, do not build much
equity.  It's a service business, and there's not a lot
that you can convert.  <p>

		But you asked me how important it is.  Nebraska
is a small business state.  I like the state.  And we
have farmers and ranchers and small business, and it's
critical to me and my family that people like Mr. Thom
have relief.<p>

		There's an article in today's Wall Street
Journal, concerning the Dole bill, about estate tax
relief.  I just thought I would quote one thing, which
I did in my written testimony.  It's about the attitude
of federal bureaucrats on taxes.<p>

		A Treasury official praises the idea of estate
tax relief for small family businesses, but says the
Dole bill -- and I quote -- "gives away too much money
to the very rich."<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Yes. <p>

		<b>DR. SCHENKEN:</b>:  It's as if it's their money to
give back. <p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Right.<p>

		<b>DR. SCHENKEN:</b>:  That's the problem.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Well said.  <p>

		Now, Allan Reynolds, chief research economist
for the Commission, reminded me that the estate tax
only raises $12 billion or so for the federal
government.  And it isn't a question of raising money
as much as it is punitive in nature.  <p>

		And each and every one of you -- I agree with
Jack Faris -- has been passionate about the subject of
how to grow this economy. And you can't do it by
confiscating the estate and the farm or the business of
the individual.<p>

		Loretta -- Commissioner Adams.  <p>

		COMMISSIONER ADAMS:  Thank you, Chairman.<p>

		Listening to all of you is very inspirational,
because I, too, am a small business owner.  <p>

		And I would like to see the outcome of this
Commission, as the title says, focus on economic growth
as well as tax reform, and want to be able to devote
much more of my energy to growing my company, rather
than see what I do with my taxes. <p>

		And one person just said -- and I remember
sitting with the accountant at the end of every fiscal
year -- "No, I'm not going to close those projects till
next year.  I don't care if the company looks larger on
paper.  I don't want to pay those taxes this year."<p>

		One of the things I've heard throughout here,
through the testimony, has to do with fairness.  And
some of you alluded to what you meant by "fairness."  <p>

		But you, in particular, Mr. Hayes, said
"fairness" at the very beginning.  And what do you mean
by "fairness" in the Tax Code as you envision it?<p>

		<b>MR. HAYES:</b>  Well, my perspective on fairness is
that if a person is doing things to grow their
business, to enhance their wealth, positive efforts
that the tax system be fair to that individual.  <p>

		It wasn't so much relative to one group of
people versus another, or a certain income level versus
another.  It was I need to feel, like, if I'm doing --
if I'm playing the game, if I'm doing it right, if I'm
playing fair as a business person, then the government
is fair with me and not taking away my incentive to do
so.  And I think that's what I meant by "fairness."  <p>

		It wasn't so much relative to different people,
but relative to my own particular situation.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Well said.<p>

		Ted.	<p>

		COMMISSIONER FORSTMANN:  Yes, I was very taken
by what all of you said.  <p>

		And I have a question which maybe we could just
have everybody answer yes or no.  <p>

		And the basic question is going to be:  	
	If we could construct something that really didn't
have the government involved in citizens' decision-making at all, would you be in favor of it?<p>

		And I want to take two examples of things that
-- one that Mr.  Abramson said and one that Mr. Hayes
said.<p>

		Who is not in favor of charities, for example? 
Who is not?<p>

		(No response)<p>

		COMMISSIONER FORSTMANN:  But I think it's --
you know, it comes down to a couple of things.  <p>

		First of all, the churches did pretty well
before 1916 --<p>

		PARTICIPANT:  That's right.<p>

		COMMISSIONER FORSTMANN:  -- number one.<p>

		And who is not in favor of saving?  Except as
Shirley and I were talking up here, we're very much in
favor of saving, except, quite honestly, we would begin
to get concerned if we saved too much, because there is
such a thing as too much savings.  <p>

		So, who's going to do all that, you know, the
guys that you're complaining about?  <p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		You see?<p>

		And so, you know, it seems to me -- I don't
want to give a speech here, but it seems to me that
we've, pretty much all of us, lived in a period of
history where we have a model in our heads that has
this stuff in it.  <p>

		And we are opposed the bureaucrats pushing us -- I'm going to point left -- this way.  We kind of are
in favor of this.  But do you really want them pushing
you that way or pushing -- okay.  <p>

		So, my question is really this.  Would you all
say yes or no.  Would you trust the market if we
devised a completely -- which isn't very hard to do, by
the way.  It takes about three or four sentences.  <p>

		If we devised a tax system which was fair,
simple, and completely neutral with respect to these
choices, no charitable deduction, no push for savings,
no nothing, just people make up their own minds and you
had a relatively low rate, high teens, low 20 percents,
or whatever, would you be in favor of that or not?<p>

		PARTICIPANT:  Yes, I would.  Probably.<p>

		COMMISSIONER FORSTMANN:  Probably.<p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		PARTICIPANT:  And if the government is going to
collect it, they're going to have to be involved in it
some way.<p>

		COMMISSIONER FORSTMANN:  No, but they're not
going to be involved in --<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  In making decisions.<p>

		COMMISSIONER FORSTMANN:  -- making decisions. 
It's going to be neutral.  Whether you save or what you
do is up to you?<p>

		<b>MR. HAYES:</b>  More than likely, yes. <p>

		PARTICIPANT:  Yes.<p>

		PARTICIPANT:  Yes.<p>

		PARTICIPANT:  That's a flat tax you're talking
about, isn't it, Ted?<p>

		COMMISSIONER FORSTMANN:  It's a flat tax with
no -- <p>

		PARTICIPANT:  Yes, with none.<p>

		COMMISSIONER FORSTMANN:  -- no pushing you in
any direction.<p>

		PARTICIPANT:  I'd be in favor of that.  Yes.<p>

		COMMISSIONER FORSTMANN:  Thank you.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Leave it to Forstmann to come
up with the conclusion of our Commission. <p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		We've got to have more hearings, Ted.  I mean,
we can't --<p>

		COMMISSIONER FORSTMANN:  Go home, John.  	
	<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  It's over.<p>

		COMMISSIONER FORSTMANN:  -- off, John.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  No, that really was a profound
point, that savings and charitable contributions -- if
the rates are low, and I keep saying to people, "Argue
with me."  And I'm easy to argue with.  <p>

		I said, "Look, if the rate is low enough, and
you're guaranteeing that there would have to be some
lid on spending and on the ability of Congress to
change it willy-nilly, capriciously, wouldn't you be
willing to give up that little twist in the Tax Code
for a very low rate and, as Ted said, in peacetime?<p>

		I don't know in peacetime there has ever been a
tax system that has worked effectively to grow the
economic and to raise revenue, which is the purpose of
a tax system.  <p>

		I don't even know of anything in peacetime that
has ever been above -- effectively above 20 or 25
percent, think.  But we're getting the cart before the
horse, but that's a very profound point.  	<p>

		We thank you for your direct answer.  First
time I've ever heard a panel say yes or no --<p>

		(Laughter) <p>

		-- follow instructions so well.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  John Wieland -- Commissioner
Wieland.<p>

		COMMISSIONER WIELAND:  Well, I'd like to have
another vote.  And this vote would be similar.  But I'd
like to have you speak on behalf of your friends who
have not appeared before this panel and may not be as
educated about the issues.<p>

		And the question would be:  Do you think your
friends would be willing to give up their mortgage
interest tax deduction and their charitable
contributions in order to have a completely neutral low
rate, or would they prefer to have a slightly higher
rate and keep those two items?<p>

		PARTICIPANT:  Want me to start?<p>

		COMMISSIONER WIELAND:  Yes, we'll start with
you.<p>

		<b>MR. HAYES:</b>  I'll go back to the question that
Herman asked me, and I think if people -- if my friends
understood that the system was simple and that everyone
was being treated fairly, I think they would be willing
to give up the mortgage interest deduction.<p>

		COMMISSION WIELAND:  Where do you think they
are today?  <p>

		<b>MR. HAYES:</b>  Where they are today, they don't
understand the system.  So, therefore, I think not.<p>

		Right now, if you were to ask the majority of
my friends, they would probably say, "No, I'm not
willing to give up the mortgage interest deductions. 
I'm not willing to give up the charitable
contribution."<p>

		But I think if you put forth a simplified
version that one could understand, I think people
understanding that, then, would be much more apt to
give that up.  But it has to be  in that regard.<p>

		MR. <b>MR. THOM:</b>  I think the answer to that is, if
you come out with a tax broom, you took last year's
taxes and you paid less taxes, they're going to be for
it.  Going to pay more taxes, they're going to be
against it.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Any other quick comment?   <p>

		<b>Mr. HENRY:</b>  We had this discussion yesterday in
my office when I was debating whether I was going to
testify today.  <p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  You had to debate?<p>

		<b>Mr. HENRY:</b>  Yes, we did.<p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		And some of my senior associates --<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Oh.<p>

		<b>Mr. HENRY:</b>  -- said, "Does that mean I'm going
to lose my interest?  And what about the charitables
that I work for?"<p>

		And I think, Mr. Kemp, you said it very, very
well.  You have to explain a low base to make it
understandable.  <p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Yes.<p>

		<b>Mr. HENRY:</b>  That's -- it has to be explained. 
You have a challenge with it right now though.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Commissioner Shirley Peterson,
former Commissioner of the IRS in the Bush
administration, within which I served as well, has
written a recent article that I want to address to both
the Commission itself, as well as to the panel and
anybody else.  But the copy is available.  It was in
The New York Times on Saturday, "Death to the Tax
Code."<p>

		I don't know if those were her words, but it's
really a blessing to our panel and to the Commission to
have Shirley.<p>

		And, Shirley, thank you for being here.<p>

And you're the next questioner.<p>

		COMMISSIONER PETERSON:  Thank you, <p>

Mr. Chairman.<p>

		Gentlemen --<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  "Death to the Tax Code."<p>

		COMMISSIONER PETERSON:  (Laughter)<p>

		Gentlemen, you were an absolutely superb panel. 
And I agree with Mr. Faris, we really should take you
on the road.  You were eloquent and right to the point.<p>

		One of the challenges that we will face as we
go forward with our assignment is trying to educate the
American people that it is possible to have both a
simple Tax Code and a fair Tax Code, because so often
in the past it has been argued or it has been assumed
that in order to be fair, it has to be complex; and
that in order to treat everybody precisely the same or
whatever, we have to, you know, create all these tiny
little rules to cover every possible piece of action.<p>

		And also, there has been some view in some
quarters that in order to be fair, that the rates have
to be -- we have to have multiple rates and that the
system has to be progressive.<p>

		So, I regard that as one of our greatest
challenges, and would welcome your views and your help
on how we might educate the American people to
understand that it is possible to have a system that is
simple, that doesn't address every kind of economic
circumstances, and yet it's also fair. <p>

		And I would welcome any comments that any of
you would like to make on that.<p>

		PARTICIPANT:  I think one of the difficulties
we have is that the IRS has been one of the causes of a
major distrust of government.  <p>

		And I think that the challenge that the
Commission and the Congress has going forward is to
develop the trust level that when you produce the facts
and explain those, that people actually believe those,
because I think the complexity that has been brought
out of trying to go along with the IRS Code, the good
faith efforts to comply and then still get bounced
cause a huge chasm there that has to be crossed.<p>

		One of the reasons I answered Mr. Forstmann
probably was my concern that changing from shelter to
non-shelter on the employment area without having some
relationship to the perceived cost of those benefits to
the individuals involved is going to be very, very
difficult.  <p>

		So I go back to the answer I gave <p>

Mr. Cain, we have got to get these people to understand
it a lot better. <p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Matt Fong, Treasurer of the
State of California, has taken time off from saving
Orange County to be with us today.<p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		COMMISSIONER FONG:  Yes, I came here to find
some money.<p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		I'd like to focus on a different area, and
that's on exports.  Nebraska is getting more and more
into exports.  <p>

		I noticed that, Mr. Thom, you export into 12
foreign countries with your irrigation equipment.  <p>

		As the California Treasurer, though, let me
thank you for another export, and that is you provided
the Chargers, the Raiders, and the 49ers with some
great players, here from your football team.  <p>

		But what I'd like to focus on is the earlier
panels have addressed that as foreign companies have
brought their goods into our country, that they are
able to shed their local domestic taxes and the concept
is called border adjustability; but that when we export
our products overseas, that it carries with it a
burden, a tax burden that we cannot shed.  <p>

		And I'm interested in your thoughts, any view
on how that has impacted you, and to the extent that
this is an important part of any kind of tax reform.    <p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Leroy.<p>

		MR. <b>MR. THOM:</b>  In the countries that we export, we
always talk about no tariffs -- you know, we're
supposed to be a free nation everywhere.  We only
export to one country that we don't bear a tariff, and
that's Israel.  All of the rest of them are as high
from 7 to <p>

25 percent.<p>

		The other thing that happens with many
countries, like Spain, for instance, anything they
offer to export, the government allows <p>

12 percent, gives them 12 percent of their product --
cost of their product.  And this makes it an unlevel
field.<p>

		It's a long way from a free trade world that we
are dreaming about here in the United States and have
dreamed about for 30 years.  And I don't think it's
ever going to come about.  		Now, maybe I'm wrong,
and I hope I'm wrong.  But I think we -- and I'm not
sure that government -- government just needs to get
off our back --<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Yes.<p>

		MR. <b>MR. THOM:</b>  -- and let us go.  We'll fight some
of these other things.  <p>

		But, you know, in my 40 years in business, I
just can't believe the amount of stuff that comes down
the pike, the amount of people that I've got to have on
the payroll that don't produce anything except for the
government.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Yes.  Well said.<p>

		PARTICIPANT:  Just a quick comment. <p>

		The answer to your question directly is yes,
we've got a deal with exports, especially Iowa and
Nebraska, but everybody.  <p>

		But I would make one comment.  Everybody talks
about the front-end load of this, the weight back home
of taxes and so on.  But I think they forget the front-end subsidies that go in to the production of whatever
is going overseas.<p>

		As you recall, America was not in GATT for
agriculture back -- originally, because the Americans
did not want agriculture covered with GATT.<p>

		So, I would, as you address this, which I hope
you do, be sure and look at the very strong political
problems dealing with the various front-end subsidies,
one country versus another, and see how we can smooth
the understanding of those out so that we can let Mr.
Thom sell his stuff without being beaten up on, which
he is right now.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  And in the interest of time,
it's -- the next panel should get prepared.<p>

		I want to thank the panel on behalf of our
Commission.  <p>

		Let me tell my fellow Commissioners, several of
the panelists either rearranged or changed -- or maybe
didn't give up, but made significant changes in their
vacation plans here in August.  <p>

		And we really appreciate -- not just the
passion, but the erudite, thoughtful, empirical,
personal evidence that you have brought before this
Commission.  <p>

		You've recharged us with the energy that never
flags, but sometimes it slows down a little bit.  <p>

		And I think Mr. Faris put it best, in thanking
each and every one of you for being here.    <p>

		Thanks, Frank and Leroy and --<p>

		PARTICIPANT:  Great job.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  -- William and Dick and Jerald
with a J and Jeff with a G.<p>

		(Applause)	<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Yes, individuals can take a
break, but I want to move on to our next panel.<p>

		(Brief recess)		<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  That was a non-break.<p>

		(Laughter) 		<p>

		Unscheduled, unrehearsed.<p>

		I said there would be no break.  And I sat here
and everybody was gone --<p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		-- so it proves the power of leadership.<p>

		(Pause)<p>

		One of the reasons for being in Omaha and so
close to Iowa and in the heartland of America is to get
a perspective from the farm community on tax policy and
economic growth.<p>

		Bob Dole is from Kansas, Dean Kleckner is from
Iowa, and our panelists represent both Nebraska and
Iowa:  <p>

		Bob Bettger of Fairmount, Nebraska. <p>

		(End tape 1, side 2)<p>

		Gary and Jackie Muller of Griswold, Iowa.<p>

		Keith Olsen of Grant, Nebraska.<p>

		Robert Soloth of McClelland, Iowa.<p>

		We're glad you're here.  Thank you very much.  <p>

		Bob, do you want to start off and give us the
benefit of your perspective and wisdom on this issue.  <p>

		And when Gary gets here, we'll go to Gary and
Jackie.<p>

		Thank you, Bob.<p>

FAIRMOUNT, IOWA</center>
<p>
<center>
<Font size="-1"><a href="#contents">Contents</a></Font>
</center><p>

		<b>MR. BETTGER:</b>  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.<p>

		Mr. Chairman and members of the Commission, my
name is Bob Bettger.  I farm at Fairmount, Nebraska.  <p>

		You have a copy of my text, and I will deviate
off that, because that does specifically state Farm
Bureau policy and agriculture's concerns in this area.<p>

		So, I will get right into our specific
situation that my family and I have and how it relates
to our operation and taxes.<p>

		I farm with my father, who is basically retired
now, and two brothers.  And we have an irrigated corn
and soybean farm approximately two hours west of here.<p>

		Over the years, we have accumulated
approximately 3800 acres.  And the last few years, the
biggest thing we've had to plan for is estate taxes and
Social Security taxes and basically just income taxes.	<p>

		And what we've done, we set up three individual
corporations, my brothers and myself, and a general
partnership.  And what that has allowed us to do,
instead of incorporating all the income into one entity
and dividing it out, we have created three separate
entities.  <p>

		We take rents.  It greatly reduces our payments
on Social Security and Medicaid by doing it that way,
trying to also keep the corporations into a lower tax
bracket.<p>

		And as Mr. Kleckner stated, one of the things
we also have to do, because we were hit somewhat in '93
with the excessive rains -- and, as Mr. Cain can
remember, the central part of the state had a very
devastating windstorm go through, and we virtually had
a half a corn crop in '93 -- and without income-averaging, we are forced to adjust our sales
accordingly, hold back some grain from one year
possibly to sell in the next, and things like that just
to help even our tax load if we can from year to year.<p>

		So, I don't know -- there'll probably be some
questions later, but another thing is the health issue. 
That's another primary reason why we've gone to this
method.  We can deduct 100 percent of -- for our
families -- our health premiums and health costs by
doing it that way, also. <p>

		And it's kind of sad, because most of our
fathers and the older generation were brought up, as
you know, agriculture is just a way of life.  And
they've never had to really treat it as a business, the
way we have to today.  <p>

		You know, they were almost out of the old shoe-box method.  You know, they'd fill the bins up and sell
corn whenever they needed to.  But unfortunately now it
is strictly a business and for a lot of reasons,
because of taxes, and this is the way we have to
operate our farms.<p>

		COMMISSIONER KLECKNER:  Thank you, Bob.	<p>

		In the absence of the Chairman, who said if he
wasn't back -- we want to thank you for being concise,
and there will be questions, I'm sure, for the panel or
comments.<p>

		We'll move now to Gary and Jackie, whichever
one of you wants to start.  <p>

		I've known you for some time.  And welcome to
this Commission hearing, and we're interested in your
comments.<p>

<a name="Muller"></a><center>PRESENTATION BY GARY AND JACKIE MULLER<br>
GRISWOLD, IOWA</center>
<p>
<center>
<Font size="-1"><a href="#contents">Contents</a></Font>
</center><p>


		MR. MILLER:  Thank you, Dean.<p>

		Herman, the first thing I would like to say, if
I was going to create a grassroots groundswell
movement, I'd have you for my spokesman.<p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		<b>COMMISSION CAIN:</b>  No, but thanks, Gary.<p>

		<b>MR. MULLER:</b>  This is Jackie, with a J.<p>

		Jackie and I would like to thank you, as a
board of Commissioners, for your effort and for your
thought put into this tax reform.<p>

		It's an honor to be here today to represent the
American farmers.  We've helped feed the world, and
we're proud to be part of that.  <p>

		For a country to remain strong, it needs a
safe, dependable, and an abundant food supply.  And we
have provided that.<p>

		But our ag sector is currently being weakened
by a system that is forcing us to make decisions based
on taxation, rather than sound economic principles.<p>

		We're going to speak to three issues today:  <p>

			Capital gains tax.<p>

			Estate tax.<p>

			And payroll taxes.<p>

		In 1869, my great-great-grandfather left
Germany because of political and economic oppression. 
He came to the United States to find greater
opportunity.  When he arrived in Iowa, he bought
farmland.  <p>

		In 1968, 99 years later, Jackie and I purchased
that land.  This land now will have a property tax
higher than the purchase price by several times.  And
this property tax must be paid whether or not we
produce anything on our farm.<p>

		One of the advantages of being a farmer is that
each farm family independently decides what plan best
suits their situation.  <p>

		For our personal situation, what makes the most
economic sense is to intensify our livestock
production. <p>

		 I have developed skills that have put me in a
position to build a world-class hog operation, a 3600-sow unit.  A unit like this will carry a price tag of
about $4 million, but it will still give us a very
favorable return on our investment.<p>

		The farmland that I would have to sell in a
quest for the capital could open up land for three
beginning farmers.  And an added benefit that this
project would give, it would be a ready market for the
grain that they would produce on this land.<p>

		However, the capital gains tax that we would
have to pay would deplete our holdings to the point
that it would be a foolish move.  So, instead of
creating a new economic opportunity for myself and
about 20 new employees, we've put the plans on hold.<p>

		Further, let me point out, if we should elect
to proceed with this project, the dollar amount will be
$2 to $3 million, too large to pass on to our children
because of estate tax.<p>

With the current exemption limit, they simply couldn't
afford to inherit it intact, thus making it difficult
for them to continue the projects that we've started.<p>

		We're not merely interested in surviving out on
the farm; we want to thrive.  But we are unable to make
our decisions based solely on our profit-and-loss
statement.  The tax ramifications have to be high on
our list of considerations.<p>

		Once again, the tentacles of taxation are
reaching through the economic lifeline of my farm and
are killing many projects before they're ever started.<p>

		We have the resources here in the Midwest to be
an effective competitor in a global economy, but the
tax system that inhibits our ability to compete needs
to be rethought.<p>

		Farming is unique from other businesses in our
inability to pass on the cost of taxation.  Farmers
don't set their own prices, and we're at the mercy of
the market because we're unable to hold our products
off the market.  <p>

		Our products are perishable, and we're unable
to hold them off the market to receive higher prices. 
It's not as simple as including higher taxes in the
selling price.  <p>

		Unnecessary taxes are stifling economic growth. 
What's needed is encouragement for myself and other
people like me who are willing to take risks and create
new jobs.  We certainly don't need any new hurdles to
jump over to do these things.  <p>

		Although not like my great-great-grandfather, I
don't plan to flee to another country, but I am turning
down opportunity based on the current tax structure
that my government is imposing on me.<p>

		I appreciate the opportunity to visit with you
this morning and make some brief points.  <p>

		I'd now like to have my better half talk about
payroll taxes.<p>

		<b>MRS. MULLER:</b>  At least you got that part right.<p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		Good morning.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Good morning, Jackie.<p>

		<b>MRS. MULLER:</b>  Payroll taxes are filled with
complexities.  It must be remembered that unlike the
folks who make the regulations that we live by, farmers
do not have at their disposal a legion of accountants
and lawyers to comply with the payroll and employment
record-keeping.  This is a real burden on the small
businessmen who try to comply and are penalized if they
make a mistake.<p>

		Every payroll check is accompanied by a variety
of computations, partially determined by the marital
status of the recipient, amount of dependents, and
frequency of payment, all requiring different charts.<p>

		Each payroll check has a minimum of six
entries, including federal tax, state tax, unemployment
tax, Social Security and Medicare withholding and the
employer matching amount.<p>

		To untangle the complexities of making out the
payroll, I use a farm accounting computer program and
subscribe to a support service for trouble-shooting.  <p>

		Of course, when I have serious problems, I can
always depend on my concise, east-to-understand --<p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		-- Circular A, Agricultural Employees' Tax
Guide to clear things up.<p>

		For example -- I've highlighted a paragraph
here -- in this paragraph, one is referred to five
other publications and requested to complete 11 other
forms, such as the 943, 1099, 1099 Miscellaneous, W-2,
W-3, 940, 940-EZ, just to name a few.<p>

		That's just one paragraph from just one of the
cumbersome publications requesting information that is
almost all redundant in the previous year's monthly
reports.    <p>

		I keep wondering how many forms they had before
the Paperwork Reduction Act.<p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		Young folks are often scared off completely
when they see the record-keeping requirements involved
in farming.  And often seasoned farmers are simply
hiring additional help in order to save the recurring
problems connected with payroll.  They are refusing to
grow because of that extra burden.    <p>

		Others are a little more creative.  Some hire
workers but call them contract labor, leaving the
details of reporting up to the workers' discretion.  Or
there are those who simply pay with cash or goods, such
as grain and livestock, and forget the deductions and
reporting altogether.<p>

		Once again, Gary and I applied your efforts to
make our tax system flatter, fairer, and simpler and, I
might add, hopefully filled with some common sense.<p>

		Not only will it help to ease the burden on the
small businessperson, but in so doing, will stimulate
economic growth.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Here, here.<p>

		<b>MRS. MULLER:</b>  Thank you.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Thank you.  Thank you.<p>

		(Applause)<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Sitting ovation.<p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		Thank you, both Jackie and Gary.<p>

<a name="Olsen"></a><center>PRESENTATION BY KEITH OLSEN<br>
GRANT, NEBRASKA</center>
<p>
<center>
<Font size="-1"><a href="#contents">Contents</a></Font>
</center><p>


		<b>MR. OLSEN:</b>  Thank you.<p>

		I am happy to have the opportunity to come
before you today and give you a farmer's perspective on
concerns that I have about our federal tax system.  <p>

		I have a dry-land farm in southwest Nebraska,
about 350 miles straight west of here.  I raise about
1300 acres of wheat and about 300 acres of corn
annually.<p>

		Also, I prepare tax returns -- have a business
in the wintertime -- and provide tax services for many
farmers, ranchers, and businesses.<p>

		I'm also a member of the Nebraska Farm Bureau
Board of Directors.<p>

		As this Commission presents recommendations, I
hope they take into concern this uniqueness that
farmers and ranchers have that may not be as important
to other types of taxpayers.<p>

		And I want to just take a couple of minutes to
talk about some of the concerns I have and try not to
duplicate some of the concerns that have already been
presented.<p>

		Farm income is very volatile.  It can go up and
down, and depending mainly upon the weather.  The only
thing consistent about weather in our part of the
state, and for most farmers in the United States, is
that weather is inconsistent.<p>

		A couple of tiny rains in June or a severe
hailstorm in July on my 1300 acres of wheat can put my
income in high tax bracket or at zero.<p>

		And to illustrate that, as we were harvesting
last -- about two weeks ago, a cloud came up and the
combines were in the field.  And about 15 minutes later
some combines didn't need to go back to the field,
because the wheat crop was destroyed by hail.  A
beautiful wheat crop <p>

-- we'd be making $200, $300 per acre gross --was
reduced to zero.  And that had a tremendous effect on
tax planning.<p>

		In 1992, in our area, most of our wheat was
destroyed by a late freeze.  Here again, how do you
plan taxwise when you have such variable income?<p>

		Another area I'd like to touch on is farmers
getting reading to retire.  I've had a friend who
retired this -- at the end of '94.  He planted his last
wheat crop in '94, which he harvested here in '95.  <p>

		He had an equipment sale and sold his
machinery.  He had no expenses in '95; he just had his
income.  So, he's going to be in a big tax bracket.  <p>

		And he found out, when he sold his equipment,
that he had a partner in his farm business.  <p>

		He bought his equipment with his own money.  He
maintained that equipment.  He made the payments on it
if he bought it on time.  He paid personal property tax
on part of it, which we have in Nebraska.  He paid the
sales tax on part of it.  He paid the insurance on it.  <p>

		But when he sold it last spring, he had a
partner, and that partner took one-third of his
machinery, just like a thief in the night coming out
and taking part of the equipment away.<p>

		And this is money that my friend was going to
use to retire on.  And one-third of it, approximately,
went to the government, both federal and state.<p>

		We did have -- prior years, we did have income
tax averaging.  That would have helped my friend,
because he would have got some of that income into a
lower tax bracket.  But we no longer have that.<p>

		Another real problem that has been touched on a
little bit -- we cannot emphasize it enough -- is the
capital gains tax due when a farmer wants to sell his
land.  <p>

		And here again, a lot of farmers have a small
tax base, bought the land years and years ago.  And we,
since then, have had much inflation in the price of
land.  And the government has just, you know, taken an
awful lot of income off of that land as tax.  <p>

		And that's going to affect me.  I'm not quite
ready to retire, but I'm getting to the age where I
need to start thinking about retirement and making my
plans.  <p>

		I had three boys.  Is one of my boys going to
come back to farm?  If he does, how do I transfer the
farm to him?<p>

		And a big concern is the tax issue.  You know,
it isn't a question of is the farm economical, can we
make a living off the farm.  It's a question of how can
you transfer that farm and not pay the government.  And
this is a real, real concern that farmers have to
address.<p>

		And farmers are not just selling assets, mainly
the land and the equipment, because of the taxes.  Some
of them are hanging in farming longer than they want
to.  They're not taking that income -- or that money
they've got invested in land.  <p>

		And to many farmers that's their retirement
plan.  They don't have a 401(k) or a Keogh Plan or
whatnot.  They put their money back into the land and
equipment, and that's what they wanted to retire on. 
And now the government takes so much of it.<p>

		Finally, I'd like to mention one other area of
concern.  As I prepare tax returns -- and a lot of my
farmers are in the $30- to $50,000 income range on a
normal year.  Abnormal years, they're below zero to
maybe $75- or $80,000. <p>

		But for many farmers, my average client in that
$30- to $50,000 range, they will pay more in Social
Security tax than they do in income tax.  And when they
get their tax bill, they don't separate the two.  They
say, "What's my tax bill?"<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Yes.<p>

		<b>MR. OLSEN:</b>  And then you point out, "Well, this
much is Social Security.  This little bit over here is
the income tax."  <p>

		And, you know, it's a fantastic amount that
goes off -- at a doable farm that has to go to the
government.  And a lot of it is Social Security tax,
the self-employment tax.  		 <p>

		I thank you for giving me an opportunity to
offer some thoughts and viewpoints.  <p>

		And a copy of my testimony was presented to the
Commission.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Great.  Great.  Thanks, Keith.<p>

		Robert Soloth.  Thanks for being here.<p>

		(Pause)<p>

		Can you move?<p>

		That's pretty cumbersome.  We apologize to our
panel.  We should have another microphone.<p>

		(Pause)<p>

		Thank you for being here, sir.<p>

<a name="Soloth"></a><center>PRESENTATION BY ROBERT SOLOTH<br>
McCLELLAND, IOWA</center>
<p>
<center>
<Font size="-1"><a href="#contents">Contents</a></Font>
</center><p>

		<b>MR. SOLOTH:</b>  I appreciate the opportunity to be
able to pass some of my thoughts on to somebody who
maybe will be able to get something done with them.<p>

		My name is Robert Soloth.  My wife, Rosalie,
and my family live near McClelland, Iowa, which is less
than 20 miles east of where we are right now.<p>

		We have four children.  Greg is a December 1944
graduate of Iowa State University and farming with us. 
Dawn is a senior at Simpson College in Indianola,
majoring in elementary education.  Lee Ann is a senior
at Trainor High, and Sarah an eighth grader.  <p>

		We farm 1750 acres in Pottawatomie County, with
1600 acres split between corn and beans and the balance
in set-aside hay and pasture.  We also have a small cow
herd.<p>

		When I was asked to speak before this
Commission, it was suggested I make my comments
primarily on capital gains.  I feel that capital gains
is one of the most unfair taxes we have.  And in my
opinion, in many instances it is a tax on a loss,
rather than a gain.<p>

		In 1966, after I returned from the Army, I
bought a new 1967 Chevy Impala.  It cost me $2500.  The
next summer, a realtor came to me wanting to sell an
80-acre farm in the next section to settle an estate.  <p>

		The price was $450 per acre.  That farm today
would bring about $1400 an acre.  To the IRS, this
would be a $950-per-acre gain, to be taxed at probably
31 percent, or $295 per acre.		<p>

		We just bought a new car last month.  It has a
fancier radio and lots of bells and whistles, but
probably weighs a third less than the '67 Chevy Impala. 
It cost $19,000.  It would have taken 5.5 acres of that
farm in <p>

1967 --<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  That's a perfect way of
explaining that.<p>

		<b>MR. SOLOTH:</b>  -- to buy the new car.<p>

		It would take 13.6 acres to buy our new car
today, a 60 percent reduction in buying power.<p>

		But it would also take another <p>

3.6 acres to pay the capital gains tax on the land
sale, making a total loss of buying power of 68
percent.<p>

		In 1968, I bought a new 85 horsepower tractor
for $8500, equal to 18 acres of land.  Today, a
similarly equipped tractor would cost $45,000, or 32
acres of the same land.  This would be a 42 percent
loss in purchasing power.  And after taxing the alleged
gain or inflation, it would take 40 acres, or a 54
percent reduction in actual value.<p>

		To give you one more example, in 1968, my
sister was attending Iowa State University.  Tuition,
room, and board had the phenomenal sum of $800 per
year, or 1.7 acres of that same farm.  <p>

		Last year, when our son graduated from Iowa
State University, the annual cost was $6,000, or 4.3
acres of land, a 61 percent reduction in buying power. 
Or with the capital gains imposed, it would now take
5.4 acres, or a 69 percent reduction in what that acre
would purchase.<p>

		There are situations where it would be best to
sell a farm, but capital gains prevents that from being
economically feasible. <p>

		In 1966, my uncle retired and I rented his
farm.  Things went well until about eight years ago,
when his wife had to be placed in a nursing home.  They
had saved some money and, along with the income of the
farm, were able to pay their bills.<p>

		Two years later, however, my uncle also had to
go to the nursing home.  They were both there together
for about two and a half years, at a cost of nearly
$42,000 per year.<p>

		After my aunt passed away, their money was
gone, along with the operating capital for the farm. 
The farm income, along with his Social Security, will
not cover the nursing home costs for my uncle.  So, the
farm has been mortgaged to make ends meet.  <p>

		As there are no heirs interested in operating
the farm, it would be best of the farm were sold, since
there is no money for repairs or soil conservation
work.  <p>

		However, because my uncle acquired the farm in
the 1930s, his basis in the farm was only $110 per
acre.  The capital gains would take nearly one-third of
the sale price.  In this situation, indexing of capital
gains would certainly not be a tax break for the rich,
as some in the media and Congress would have us
believe.  <p>

		Indexing of capital gains for inflation would
be beneficial for the farm economy, because it would
make more farmland available to young farmers.  It
would put cash into the marketplace or into lending
institutions where it could be loaned for expansion and
capital improvements.  <p>

		There would be more willingness to invest in
agriculture if people knew their investment would not
be punished with a regressive capital gains tax.   <p>

		Thank you.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Yes.  <p>

		Let me say, on behalf of the Commission, we've
had testimony for several weeks, and all of it has been
good.  All of it has been essential to the work of this
Commission.<p>

		And I would not be disrespectful to the
wonderful contribution that Keith Olsen and Jackie and
Gary and Bob have made.<p>

		But, Robert, may I say, as the son of a small
businessman -- my daddy was a truck driver and turned
it into a trucking company -- but whether it's trucks
or farming or widget-making or producing bread or wine
or a service, no one has yet testified to this
Commission in such an eloquent fashion on the basic
ingredient of a free market or free enterprise economy,
that you must judge the value of an enterprise not by
some abstraction.  		<p>

		You have brought it down from the abstract to
the empirical, the objective, the historical, the
personal, the family, the real.  		And on behalf of
all of us, and myself in particular, I really want to
thank all of you -- but you particularly -- talking
about acreage and what it would take today to send a
child to college, buy a car, do the things that we, as
Americans, call the American Dream.  <p>

		But it is not American; it is universal.  It is
the universal dream of people everywhere, from South
Africa to the South Bronx, and from East Europe to East
L.A.<p>

		So, that was very, very powerful.  And we're
going to circulate all of your testimony.<p>

		But, Robert, again, it was again, that was a
tremendous contribution to our work.  I really want to
thank you.<p>

		Excuse me for making such a lengthy editorial
comment, but you moved us all.  All of you have, but
that was great.<p>

		The president of the American Farm Bureau,
Commissioner Dean Kleckner.<p>

		COMMISSIONER KLECKNER:  Okay.  Thank you, Jack.<p>

		I would echo what Jack Kemp just said.  And all
of you gave outstanding testimony.  I want to read it
all.<p>

		I can just say amen, or ditto, or whatever, to
all of what you said.  It's what we deal with
constantly in agriculture -- and small business, too,
Herman.  And all of you, it's the same issue.<p>

		Jackie, you particularly -- you talked about
Social Security and Medicare, that tax.  And someone
said that, for farmers, it's often more than the income
tax.  <p>

		I mean -- I guess, Keith, it was you, wasn't
it, as you prepare tax returns? <p>

		How is it affecting all of you?  <p>

		And, you know, Social Security is kind of off
limits politically now.  It's such a touchy issue with
the elderly.  <p>

		And I'm approaching it a lot faster than I
really want to admit, thinking that my mother is 86
years old now, living in Osage, Iowa, on Social
Security and some minor other investments that she
made.  She was a nurse.  <p>

		And our senior citizens worry about Social
Security.  <p>

		And with the media constantly drumming into our
politicians, it almost is off limits to even talk
about.  But heck, I don't care.  I'm going to talk
about it.  I'm going to ask about it.<p>

		What's your view on that?  Is it untouchable? 
Where are we going with it?  What do you think we ought
to do?<p>

		Bob, you're --  <p>

		<b>MR. BETTGER:</b>  Well, one thing that I would like
to talk about on Social Security -- and in 1991, we
were more or less forced to incorporate out business to
avoid some of these taxes.  And I'm sure these other
gentlemen have, too.<p>

		One thing that happens to a farmer as an
individual, when he buys land and he works all of his
life to pay for it, and unless he does something to
incorporate his business otherwise, that land is paid
for, and even though it's an investment -- and the
return from that investment, when he sells grain, it
goes on his 1040-F.  And he pays Social Security on the
return from the investment in that farm, because it's
all included in his 1040-F.<p>

		And it has forced anybody with any acreage or
who owns any land to incorporate or to some way get
around that.  <p>

		But as far as Social Security, I'm <p>

50 years old, and if I could opt out of it now, I sure
would.  <p>

		<b>MRS. MULLER:</b>  I would like to speak to that,
because whenever I write out a payroll check, about
one-third of the -- well, okay, to give an example, if
a man earns $1,000 approximately, he receives about
$800, but I send to the government the extra $200.  <p>

		So, to me, that man costs me $1200, but he's
only making $800 -- taking home $800, I mean.  I don't
think that sounds fair to either one of us.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Yes.<p>

		<b>MRS. MULLER:</b>  And the biggest comment that I
hear from virtually everyone is "We're sending this in,
but it won't be there when we get there anyway."<p>

		That is just a universal comment, I believe.<p>

		And like Mr. Soloth, I believe we'd all just be
glad to get rid of it.  Like many of our other
government programs, I think it probably started out as
a very good idea, to help people with catastrophic
problems that hadn't, for some reason, been able to
save for their retirement.<p>

		One thing, it has just simply gone awry.  We're
giving people -- not only are they getting a living,
but cost-of-living increases?  		Pardon me, but as
a farmer, I don't get a cost-of-living increase.<p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		I could probably -- <p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  No, that's --<p>

		<b>MRS. MULLER:</b>  -- take the entire forum to talk
about Social Security taxes, so I'll just pass.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Well, no.  You made a powerful
case for the explanation of the wedge <p>

-- that is, the gap between what a worker gets to take
home in his or her paycheck and what the employer must
pay to get his or her work done --i.e., labor.  <p>

		And the wider the wedge, the more frustration,
the employer vis-a-vis the worker.  And that's what
this whole issue is about.  Reducing the wage lowers
the cost of labor and brings more employment, brings a
broader tax base.  <p>

		So, that -- hearing it from you, I think --
everybody says, "Oh, economics is so difficult."  <p>

		Nonsense.  It is common sense.  <p>

		I think Keith Olsen said, "I hope you approach
this with common sense."  That is just a commonsense
approach to taxation.<p>

		Loretta.  And then Herman Cain.<p>

		COMMISSIONER ADAMS:  You mentioned, Jackie,
there were six deductions on your payroll check.  If
I'm reading mine correctly, it's either five or seven;
I'm not sure.<p>

		<b>MRS. MULLER:</b>  Well, I said a minimum of six.<p>

		COMMISSIONER ADAMS:  Okay.<p>

		I hear a recurring theme and concern here, and
that is with capital gains and estate taxes.<p>

		If the world were ideal, how do you all see
that as taking shape or form and having to change?<p>

		PARTICIPANT:  It appears to me that capital
gains is just a tax that is regressive.  It's not
making sense.  It's causing us to do things out here on
the farm that we should not be doing.  <p>

		If we're going to remain strong as a country --
and I think that this is a key issue, that has to be
addressed.  If we're not going to stay strong as a
country, if we're not going to be able to lead the
world in the things that we're doing, it's not going to
be very long before we're not going to be able to take
care of many of the other problems.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Keith.  <p>

		<b>MR. OLSEN:</b>  I'll speak up.  I think most people
would be willing to pay maybe some capital gains tax,
but not at the rate it is today, which is 28 percent, I
think, maximum.<p>

		I don't think we are trying to avoid taxes; we
just don't want to pay an exorbitant amount.  And if
the capital gains comes under the flat tax, if that's
what the proposal is and it's taxed similar to other
property, that may be acceptable.  <p>

		It's kind of hard to talk about exactly where
you want to be at until you see some definite figures.<p>

		But it does hurt the economy.  There's no doubt
about it.  If farmers don't sell <p>

land --<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Right.   <p>

		<b>MR. OLSEN:</b>  -- whatever it may be -- if they
don't sell -- people don't sell stock, because too much
money will be lost.   <p>

		So, it is just way too high.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Keith. <p>

		<b>MR. OLSEN:</b>  I'll speak up.<p>

		I think most people would be willing to pay
maybe some capital gains tax, but not at the rate it is
today, which is 28 percent, I think, of maximum.<p>

		I don't think we are trying to avoid taxes.  We
just don't want to pay an exorbitant amount.  And if
the capital gains comes under the flat tax, if that's
what the proposal is, and it's taxed similar to other
property, that may be acceptable.<p>

		It's kind of hard to talk about exactly where
you want to be at until you see some definite figures.<p>

		But it does hurt the economy.  There's no doubt
about it.  If farmers don't sell <p>

land --<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Right.	<p>

		<b>MR. OLSEN:</b>  -- whatever it may be, if they
don't well -- people don't sell stock because too much
money will be lost.<p>

		So, it is way too high.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Commissioner Cain.<p>

		<b>COMMISSIONER CAIN:</b>  Mr. Bettger, <p>

Mr. Muller, Mrs. Muller, Mr. Soloth, Mr. Olsen, I don't
have a question.  I have a comment.<p>

		I don't think you realize how impactful (sic)
you've been here in what you had to say today -- will
have not only on what we ultimately recommend, but what
your comments have done to inspire all of us in facing
the challenges that we are going to face, trying to
deliver your message in -- with the same amount of
passion and conviction that you have displayed here
today.  <p>

		And I sincerely want to thank you, because
you've -- as Jack indicated earlier, when we all took
our schedules, and Jack said, "Okay, now take your
current schedule, and you're going to squeeze an extra
meeting in there, an extra trip a week for the next six
months," you have energized me personally with your
message and your comments and your situation.  <p>

		And I don't think you really realize how
impactful (sic) it has been or will be in ultimately
what we attempt to do with respect to the
recommendation of this Commission.  <p>

		So, I just want to thank you.  I don't have a
question.  i just thank you for taking the time and
sharing your comments.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Mr. Faris.<p>

		COMMISSIONER FARIS:  Mine was a '67 Chevy
Impala, two-door --	<p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		-- with a black vinyl top, emerald green.  I
wish I had that car back.<p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		Now, I should have bought it where you did,
because I remember paying more money for it at the time
than you did, because I still remember that bill.  <p>

		But I also realize that when I went to school
and what my son's college is costing me today, I dream
of one day having that much money.  And now it's paying
it per year.<p>

		Very impactful (sic) in terms of relating that
to your business.  I think words are very important.  <p>

		And the words you're using and how you're
framing the issue go back to one of the big challenges
that we have, and that's communication.<p>

		What are the real problems?  And what are the
real solutions?<p>

		The payroll tax -- your example of showing us,
Jackie, the booklet and forms that you have to go by
and how inane all this is.<p>

		But the payroll tax issue that Dean Kleckner
brought up, that we've talked about, I keep hearing
from small business owners, not just in this area, not
just on farms and ranches, but small businesses around
the country, from a priority standpoint.  <p>

		How do you feel about this Commission and our
charge to look at taxes from the federal government and
our charge -- should we be looking at payroll taxes and
the impact of the payroll tax, since more small
business owners around America pay more money in
payroll tax than they do in income tax?<p>

		Well, how do you -- not just you, Jackie, but
the others, you're the ones who have to see it every
day in making out these six entries.  How do you feel
about that whole issue vis-a-vis what we're going?   <p>

		PARTICIPANT:  Well, in your earlier panel, they
were talking about how to communicate to the general
public about the change in the tax law.  <p>

		And I think if they would totally eliminate tax
withholding and the IRS can open an office in the post
office -- but if everybody had to go write a check
every week or every month for their taxes, there would
be a whole lot more awareness in this country of how
much it takes.  And it would also take a big load off
small business.<p>

		PARTICIPANT:  Well, I'd also like to point out
that one of the problems that we have with our
government is the amount of spending that we have.  And
part of that is because of the huge bureaucracy that we
have created.<p>

		I think government could take a lesson from
agriculture.  If they could have improved their
productivity at the rate farmers have improved their
productivity, three out of four of them wouldn't have a
job.<p>

		<b>MRS. MULLER:</b>  I'd like to speak to the concern
about getting the message across -- and I bet I'll get
a nod of every head up there when I say that the media
does not portray what is happening and what needs to be
done accurately.  It just doesn't come to us with a
slant, but it really should.<p>

		PARTICIPANT:  Well, let me <p>

encourage --<p>

		<b>MRS. MULLER:</b>  I think that's a big problem that
you have.  I don't see how you can sell this if you
have to go through the media to do it.<p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		PARTICIPANT:  That's a great point.<p>

		And I'll tell you, when we listen to panels and
listen to the eloquence of -- the crispness of your
testimony, it's penetrating.  As Herman said, it
excites us and encourages us.<p>

		Let me please urge and recommend that you write
letters to the editors, to cut through some reporting
that's done or not done, and encourage you to be
willing to come testify, to be willing to speak up and
speak out more, because, quite frankly, as a
Commission, we can just say and do so much and it will
be pictured and framed a certain way.  <p>

		But what you're doing every day, from your
farm, ranch, and business, to communicate is extremely
important.<p>

		I just want to encourage you, for your
testimony, not only to us today, but don't lose your
voice.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Great.<p>

		John - Commissioner Wieland.  Question?<p>

		COMMISSIONER WIELAND:  Mr. Bettger said that he
had created several corporations to, you know, deal
with the issues that are out there.  And I wonder if
the rest of you -- is that what you have done, and is
that what other farmers have done generally?<p>

		PARTICIPANT:  We have not incorporated our
farm, because whenever we start getting into these
types of organizational changes, you've got to take
into considerations what it's going to do with your tax
bases of your land, how are you going to be able to
take your land back out.  		We visited with a
bunch of lawyers.  You can visit with a bunch of
accountants.  And it's very difficult to figure out
what needs to be done.  And after you're looking at
both issues, I'm not sure which way is the right way. 
And I get tired of paying the accountants and attorneys
trying to advise me.<p>

		<b>MR. BETTGER:</b>  As I mentioned, we did
incorporate our business in 1991, and I felt we were
forced into it.  We were looking at having two kids in
college for three years, and that amounts to more than
I, at one time, would have ever thought I could make.<p>

		When we were looking at trying to raise our
income, we were already at the point -- between
federal, Social Security, and state income taxes, we
were already paying at a rate of about 56 percent.  So,
any new dollar that we took in, we were only going to
be able to keep 44 percent.  <p>

		By incorporating and keeping land out of the
corporation, the corporation rents the land back.  And
we've eliminated the Social Security tax on the
investment that I mentioned earlier, and we are able to
deduct our health care.  <p>

		And there are a few things that it helps, but
it also creates double bookkeeping, it creates legal
fees, and there are also a lot of drawbacks.  <p>

		But like I said, I felt that we were forced
into it, not because we really wanted to do it.  <p>

		PARTICIPANT:  All right.  I incorporated in
1979.  The main reason was for tax management and debt
management. <p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Ted.<p>

		COMMISSIONER FORSTMANN:  I'm kind of with
Herman.  I think that people like yourselves are what
America is really all about.<p>

		I just would like to say that I've got
everybody's written testimony here, except Gary and
Jackie Muller.  <p>

		And if you could get it written up --<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Yes.<p>

		COMMISSIONER FORSTMANN:  -- it would be great
for me, because I think there are places we can put
this and incorporate it.  <p>

		And I was particularly taken by something Gary
said.<p>

		About your great-grandfather (sic), <p>

I guess.  He left Germany for a reason.  And I don't
believe that what we're talking about here is really
economics.  There is nothing -- there is no economics
in favor of the kind of looney things that you people
are forced to do.  There's no such thing as it.  <p>

		We're really talking about civics.  We're
talking about essentially two ways of looking at how
life should be lived.  One is where the state is kind
of preeminent.  And the other is where the person is
kind of preeminent.<p>

		And to make a long story short, your
grandfather (sic) left Germany because at that time the
state was very preeminent.  There <p>

was a -- <p>

		And if we don't get things right here, that's
really what you're talking about.  You're all forced to
do this crazy stuff, thinking about incorporating, not
incorporating -- this, that and the other -- for what
reason?  <p>

		Nobody on this side of the fence and nobody on
this side of the fence has been able to come up with
any reason at all except that the state interferes in
your lives.<p>

		And so we really ought to try.  I'm with
Herman.  We all are donating time and a lot.  And I'm
glad we are, because without people like you, there
isn't going to be anything worth doing here.<p>

		Thank you.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  That is a very important point
to anybody who is listening.<p>

		All of these men and women are busy.  They're
all independent, other than Fong, who represents the
taxpayers of the State of California.  But everybody
has paid their own way, as they do.  We're not
government-funded.  <p>

		Everybody brings their enthusiasm and their
passion to this job, because we believe the country
cannot go into the 21st century without addressing the
issues that you have brought to us.  <p>

		So, you can rest assured that you have a
megaphone through this Commission.  And as Ted said,
this Nation could not have been founded nor can it go
forward, without becoming, once again, the land of
opportunity.<p>

		Matt, do you want to ask a question?  Then
we'll wrap it up. <p>

		COMMISSIONER FONG:  I will say, Jack, that I'm
now like everybody else, because California didn't pass
its budget yet, so I'm not getting paid, also.<p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  I'll take up a collection.<p>

		COMMISSIONER FONG:  Yes, the hat going around
is mine.  <p>

		Yes, all the elected officials in California
are not getting paid till the budget is out, which is
fine.  It'll put pressure us to get this through.<p>

		California, like Nebraska and Iowa, or other
farm belt states, has a big agricultural community.  <p>

		I'm concerned about the next-generation farmer. 
And one of the things that you've all touched upon is
the generational transfer.<p>

		The farmers that I was able to talk to said
that it is an issue of, like, big versus small.  It's
just -- farming is just a tough business.<p>

		I'm interested in your perspective of to what
extent, when the next generation is talking about
either becoming farmers or inheriting the farm, are
taxes part of that decision?  <p>

		Is it a big part?  Is it a small part?  What is
the thought process?<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Bob, do you want to respond?<p>

		<b>MR. BETTGER:</b>  Yes, I was going to just
reiterate what the previous panel said about fairness. 
I think whatever concept you have to put forward from
this panel's perspective, it would be better perceived
and better accepted if they knew that it was going to
be fair, because Mr. Muller over here, in his tax
situation, has to compete against Murphy Farms.  <p>

		And so whatever you do for those people, he
doesn't necessarily want to compete with them. I think
he probably could, but as long as there's a fairness
issue there.<p>

		And the same way over here, like the
Continentals and Cargills and the -- on the grain side
of it.  I mean, whatever you put together, as long as
it's going to be fair, I think it would be acceptable.<p>

		But that's basically what we've got to compete
against anymore.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Any other?  <p>

		Gary.<p>

		<b>MR. MULLER:</b>  I'd like to address the issue of
big versus small.<p>

		A friend of mine just returned from Georgia,
the country of Georgia.  And there they are starting to
divide their country up into private enterprise.  And
one of the things that they're trying to set up is
create farm land that the individual owns.  <p>

		But what they're trying to set up is about two
hectare plots per person.  That's about five acres.<p>

		What five acres is going to do for those people
is going to guarantee that they are going to be
peasants the rest of their life.<p>

		And as I stated in my testimony, we're not out
here just trying to survive and create a subsistence
life.  <p>

		We don't need to be looked at as second class
citizens as a group of farmers.  We're going to be out
here, and we're going to survive all right.  <p>

		But we're going to thrive, and we're going to
do a good job of it.  And unfortunately, we have
tremendous frustrations and other problems that we have
dealing with the government in getting our job
accomplished.<p>

		MS. MULLER:  I hope if we've accomplished
nothing else today, that we've possibly dispelled the
myth that farmers are hayseeds.<p>

		I think this panel has done an eloquent job of
speaking.  I'm really proud to be on it.<p>

		I want to speak to the issue of making things
simpler.  We're not simple people, and we don't
necessarily need things simpler.  But we just want
things to make common sense.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Yes.<p>

		MS. MULLER:  And one of the things, for me, is
inheritance tax.  To me, I see absolutely no
justification for inheritance tax, other than we need
to grease the wheels of an already too cumbersome
government.<p>

		If we didn't have this inheritance tax problem
or the capital gains problem that it poses, I think a
lot of land would free up.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Yes.<p>

		MS. MULLER:  But if the people that are holding
it are in nursing homes, like he's talking about,
passing it on to their children who are 70 years old or
so, and it's not getting freed up for some of these
younger farmers that you're talking about that want to
get started in farming, a lot of the problem is our
land is simply not available to be farmed by the young
farmers.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Our next is going to
address this whole issue.  <p>

		We've got Patrick Hendershott from <p>

Ohio State University, and Robert Genetski, <p>

Bob Genetski; George Zodrow; and John Anderson <p>

-- all of whom are economists and experts on tax
policy.<p>

		And I know they'll remind us of something that
came from a simple, yet profound, farming career and
life, which is that you either have a Tax Code that
redistributes wealth, or you have a Tax Code that
allows wealth to be created.<p>

		And Forstmann asked the question rhetorically
about how this happened.  It grew.  		But it grew
because, in my opinion, having been in the Congress for
so long, 18 years from Buffalo, New York, there are two
kinds of politics.  <p>

		There is the politics of envy and the politics
of egalitarian -- not egalitarian reward, but
egalitarian opportunity.  I think that's what democracy
really is.<p>

		And envy and fear that someone is going to get
rich is what has added to the complexity of the Tax
Code in my opinion.<p>

 		There would be no estate tax.  There is no
earthly reason to tax someone's income, tax it again in
a dividend, tax it again on a capital gain or risk, tax
it again at death.<p>

		I hope their panel can come up with a simple,
single source of tax.  Not judging the outcome, but all
of us are passionate in our belief.<p>

		I would make one other point about the press. 
Reagan proved, I think, once and for all that good
economics is good politics, without suggesting that
everything was perfect.  <p>

		I think it was clear that he got attacked --
left and probably right -- for trying to reduce tax
rates and regulations and to strengthen the currency
back in the early '80s.  <p>

		And it overcame the hostility of the press.  It
drove the press crazy that Ronald Reagan could win the
presidency of the United States on a program of getting
America moving again.  <p>

		And incidentally, that's what John F. Kennedy
did in the early '60s, and that's how a lot of people
really approach this issue.  <p>

		How can we make America grow by allowing
farmers to farm, businessmen and women to produce
widgets, and people to save?<p>

		I am -- well, I think all of us very much
appreciate the simple, yet profound, message of this
panel.  We're going to make sure that your testimony is
spread a lot wider than just our panel.  And we will be
your megaphone, because we believe you are the heart of
the American Dream.<p>

		And before we go to the next panel, I would
like to suggest, since my instructions were not carried
with regard to the first <p>

break --		<p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		-- could we keep the second break to <p>

10 minutes, be back here at 11:15.  And then we'll wrap
up the last session about 12-ish.  		So, we'll
have 45 minutes with our last panel, maybe more with
the press conference -- press availability at 12:10.<p>

		Thank you so much, Jackie, Gary, Bob.<p>

PRESIDENT, GENETSKI ASSOCIATES</center>

<center>"Tax Restructuring and Financial Markets" </center>
<p>

		<b>MR. GENETSKI:</b>  Okay.  Thanks.  <p>

		It's a pleasure to be here.<p>

		Okay.  Let me tell you, first of all, I'm going
to be talking primarily as an economist, but also I
can't help but to talk as a small businessman --<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Right.<p>

		<b>MR. GENETSKI:</b>  -- because I do have my own
company as well.<p>

		And as an economist, most of my work has been
associated with research on the tax system and its
effect on the economy, as well as on the tax system and
its effect on financial markets.<p>

		And I want to touch on three areas:  <p>

			One, the abuse in the current tax system.<p>

			Second, what should not be done in the way
of reform.<p>

			And third, what should be done in the way
of reform.<p>

		First of all, in terms of the current tax
system, there is no doubt that it's inefficient, it's
wasteful, it's destructive, it promotes abuse, and it
undermines family values.<p>

		It has got a lot of costs associated with it. 
Some are obvious, and they've been mentioned before. 
And some are not so obvious.<p>

		Among the fairly obvious costs are the costs of
compliance and administration.  And the figures there
are pretty astounding, about <p>

$150 billion, bare minimum, in terms of cost of
compliance and administration.<p>

		And if we divide that by the number of workers,
we're talking about $1200 per worker per year for the
current tax system.<p>

		That's an obvious cost.  Some of the costs are
less obvious.  They're indirect costs that result from
the type of inefficiencies promoted by the tax system
over time, because we don't get the productive
investment that we normally would have.<p>

		My estimate of what this costs is somewhere in
the vicinity of $5000 per worker for this year alone. 
So, you can see the costs are enormous.  And these are
just the beginning of the costs.  <p>

		There are also psychological costs to a tax
system that undermines moral feelings and moral values.<p>

		My wife and I have a couple of friends who are
fairly well off.  They have gotten a divorce strictly
for tax reasons.  They claim they save $60,000 a year
by not being married, and yet they still live together.<p>

		You don't have to be wealthy.  My son, my first
son to get married, got married a year ago and found
out, after doing some calculations, that just being
married, instead of living together, meant that the
modest incomes that he and his wife make were taxed at
an extra $700 in terms of income tax, simply because
they had decided to go ahead and get married.<p>

		Traditionally, I think we like to have a lot of
respect for our government.  When we see a tax system
doing what it's doing to us, a great deal of resentment
builds up.  And clearly this resentment is not healthy.<p>

		Actually, I think the resentment would run even
deeper if people really understood the full costs and
the full quirks in the current tax system and some of
the ridiculous things they do.<p>

		For example, in my work and research into the
effect of the tax system on financial markets, it's
very clear to me that there is a substantial premium
that is in most interest rates as a result of the
nature of the tax system.  <p>

		The tax deductibility of the interest, on one
hand, and the fact that the government taxes interest
payments, on the other, adds approximately one-third to
every taxable interest rate that we're looking at.  <p>

		So, one-third of the taxable rates that we're
looking at are strictly attributable to the current tax
system.<p>

		What does that mean for mortgages?  That means
that an 8 percent mortgage under a system that did not
artificially exempt interest expenses and tax interest
rates, the 8 percent mortgage should really be less
than <p>

5-1/2 percent.  And that's what would happen under
certain reforms of the tax system.<p>

		Another interesting thing is federal debt.  The
federal government pays approximately $210 billion a
year in interest on the debt.  One-third of that
interest results from the in the tax system, $70
billion.  <p>

		Now, there's an offset.  The government gets
money back and gets revenue back when people pay taxes
on their interest income.<p>

		But there's not a full offset for a lot of
people.  For example, foreigners, rich foreigners,
wealthy foreigners, foreign central banks, foreign
institutions, all get the full benefit of this tax
premium that results from our tax law.<p>

		I have calculated that that is a pure gift to
wealthy foreigners of more than <p>

$15 billion every year that most people simply don't
accept or don't understand that's involved in the
current complexity of our tax laws.<p>

		So, there is a lot of abuse for the current tax
system.  I think that just about everyone is aware of
that.  And the key question is:  How should we change
it?<p>

		It's a very critical question.  In my research,
I've found that tax policy is the single most important
factor affecting economic growth and affecting incomes. 
And the opportunity for tax reform doesn't come around
too often.<p>

		And so when we do get the opportunity, it's
absolutely critical to get it right.  And getting it
right means making sure we don't make mistakes and
undertake some type of reform that's at least as bad or
perhaps worse than the current system.<p>

		The first type of reform that I believe is
definitely worse than the current system would involve
a VAT, or a valued-added tax.  This type of tax is an
utter failure wherever it's imposed.  <p>

		It's extremely complex.  It's highly expensive. 
It penalized those who have saved in the past.  And
it's a hidden tax.  People don't realize exactly what
they're paying for their government.  <p>

		And when they don't realize how much they're
paying for their government, there's a tendency to
demand more government than they otherwise would get.<p>

		Another direction that we don't want to go
would be a national sales tax.  A national sales tax is
certainly simpler than the VAT, not as expensive, but
it has the disadvantage of hitting those who are least
able to pay the hardest.<p>

		And if we try and play with the sales tax to
avoid hurting low-income people, by exempting certain
items and trying to tax higher incomes at a higher
rate, we end up with all the complexities of the
current tax system.  So, that's certainly a nonstarter.<p>

		In addition, the sales tax has the same
disadvantages of the VAT, in the sense that it
penalizes anyone who has saved in the past, because
their income is worth less under the new, high cost for
all these items.<p>

		And secondly, the cost of government is hidden. 
It's not obvious to people.  If you hide the cost of
government, people are going to demand more government
than they otherwise would.<p>

		Third, we don't want to reform the tax system
and keep the current high marginal tax rates.  And my
reason for this third point relates directly to some of
the research I have done on the effects of taxes on
economic activity.<p>

		What I have found is that taxes are a very
powerful force affecting economic activity.  Most of my
work has been devoted to something that I call the
effective marginal tax rate paid by upper-income
individuals, individuals in the 70th to 95th
percentile.  The effective marginal rate is the rate
they actually pay to the government after all the
deductions and everything else.<p>

		Looking at this rate historically, I have found
that for every one percentage point change in this
effective marginal tax rate, productivity growth in the
economy changes by roughly 2/10ths of a percent in the
opposite direction.  <p>

		Now, this doesn't sound like a whole lot, but
you add productivity changes up, and they accumulate
over years, and before you know it, you're talking
about very significant increases in living standards as
a result of this particular tax policy.<p>

		So, my conclusion with this respect is that we
don't want to raise or even keep marginal tax rates the
same.  <p>

		As a matter of fact, this research incidentally
suggests that when you go back historically, whenever
effective marginal tax rates were changed, it was
usually associated -- almost always associated with a
tax increase.  And the same was true whenever effective
marginal tax rates were cut.<p>

		The one example we have of lowering effective
marginal tax rates during the 1986 Tax Act, but trying
to balance it by raising taxes in other areas and
cutting off deductions, suggests that we do not the
same impact on productivity rule.  <p>

		As a result, if you really want positive impact
on the economy, it can't simply be a tradeoff of
lowering marginal rates and raising rates somewhere
else.  <p>

		The maximum amount of tradeoff is going to come
from lowering the rates, not only at the margin but
also on average, trying to get them down as low as
possible.<p>

		What should we do?  <p>

		In concept, the technical features of an ideal
tax have already been worked out by Hall and Rabushka
in their book "The Flat Tax."  They've done a lot of
work, over a decade of serious thinking.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Bob, with all due respect,
they're going to testify.  <p>

		We're going to spend three days with Rabushka
and --<p>

		<b>MR. GENETSKI:</b>  Okay.  And let me just say one
thing about the Hall and Rabushka plan and also the
other plan.  The plan is a great plan.  <p>

		As a small business person, who looks at this,
also, from a business perspective, I believe that they
made a mistake in terms of their treatment of the
payroll tax.  And that's extremely important,
especially in light of some of the test -- <p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Can we do that in Q&amp;A?  I want
to get to the other --<p>

		<b>MR. GENETSKI:</b>  Sure.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  -- testimony and get some
interface --<p>

		<b>MR. GENETSKI:</b>  Sure.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  -- with the Commission.<p>

		<b>MR. GENETSKI:</b>  Okay.  Can I just make one last
point --<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Absolutely.<p>

		<b>MR. GENETSKI:</b>  -- just very quickly, on
something that was brought up earlier, because the main
objective, as I see it, of this Commission is going to
have to be to sell the public, first, on the abuses in
the system and, second, on the benefits that can be had
from the ideal tax --<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Right.<p>

		<b>MR. GENETSKI:</b>  -- the flat tax.<p>

		In terms of doing that, you can be as eloquent
as you possibly can, the written report, my belief is
that unfortunately today too many people don't read,
and they just don't pay any attention to that. <p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  What would you suggest?<p>

		<b>MR. GENETSKI:</b>  What I would suggest is the
panels that you're listening to, the passion that you
saw in the earlier panels today -- <p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Right.<p>

		<b>MR. GENETSKI:</b>  -- you've already got some
videotapes of that.  <p>

		If that can be put together in a half-hour or
an hour show, showing real people, the problems they've
encountered, and letting people know what in the heck
the problems are, and then quickly some vignettes on
some of the ideal solutions, I think that that would go
a long way to --<p>

<p>

		<b>MR. HENDERSHOTT:</b>  Thank you for inviting me and
giving me the chance to see the fair city of Omaha.<p>

		It is a pleasure, again, to be of potential
service to Mr. Kemp.  He may not remember, but I was
the chief outside consultant for Price Waterhouse when
they did their first actual review of FHA back in '89,
'90.  And at that time, you were able to take steps to
help save FHA.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Thank you.<p>

		<b>MR. HENDERSHOTT:</b>  I hope the Commission will be
able to take steps to help save the future of my
granddaughters and other grandchildren in America.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Good.<p>

		<b>MR. HENDERSHOTT:</b>  Today is a particularly
appropriate day to have me on to talk about housing,
because there's an Op-Ed piece that you may or may not
have seen in the Wall Street Journal this morning by
Bruce Bartlett, titled "Will the Flat Tax KO Housing?"<p>

		As always, Mr. Bartlett says many interesting
things, but I'm afraid he isn't always entirely
correct.  And that's really -- it turns out that's
really the topic of my conversation this morning.<p>

		All investments -- virtually all investments
pay two kinds of returns.  They pay sort of a periodic
cash flow.  Stocks pay dividends, interest. 
Investments in real estate will pay various kinds of
net rents, and most investments will pay capital gains.<p>

		Now, owner-occupied housing is just like these
other investments.  Owner-occupied housing has a cash
flow return.  This cash flow return is the rents that
the occupier pays himself as the owner.  The implicit
rents are on owner-occupied housing.  That's the cash
flow.  Of course, in housing, you generally get capital
gains.<p>

		The tax advantage for owner-occupied housing is
the very light taxation of these returns.  We don't tax
the implicit rents on housing; and we tax the capital
gains at a very low rate, due to deferrals and the
like.<p>

		I could stop at that point, and I could tell
you that's the tax advantage to owner-occupied housing. 
Note that I have not mentioned the mortgage interest
deduction.<p>

		Due to my hard work, clean living, and mainly
aging and having a frugal wife, I have accumulated
significant wealth, so I don't have a mortgage on my
house.  It makes -- there's no advantage for me to have
a mortgage on my house. 		You could imagine me
getting a mortgage, investing it in Ginnie Mae
securities, the same kind of investment, a mortgage.  I
earn interest on the mortgage investments.  I pay taxes
on it.  I write off the mortgage interest as a tax
deduction.  It's a wash.  A mortgage interest deduction
doesn't give me a tax advantage.  The tax advantage is
the virtual nontaxation of the return from the asset.<p>

		Now, what role does the mortgage interest play? 
The mortgage interest deduction says that not only do I
get the tax advantage from owner-occupied housing, but
my children do.  My children are young.  They don't
have wealth.  They have to borrow.<p>

		What the mortgage interest deduction says is
that there will not be a penalty to debt financing of
housing.  The mortgage interest deduction does not give
a tax advantage to debt.  I have already shown that it
doesn't give me any advantage.  <p>

		The tax advantage, what the mortgage interest
deduction does is it says that young people will have
the tax advantage just as well as older people.  It
levels the playing field; it doesn't make in unlevel.<p>

		So, what would you do if you took away the
mortgage interest deduction?  When you take away the
mortgage interest deduction, you create an unlevel
playing field, you buy deficit financing of housing in
favor of equity, and you basically are going to cause a
redistribution of income.<p>

		Now, this isn't a redistribution between income
classes.  We know that the vast majority of the
advantage of the mortgage interest deduction goes to
higher-income people, but they pay most of the taxes. 
So, that's not going to cause any -- the redistribution
is from young to old.  <p>

		We take away the mortgage interest deduction,
we can use the revenue to lower taxes.<p>

		People like myself will get a tax break. 
People like my kids will get a tax break, but they'll
more than pay for it by not being able to deduct the
mortgage interest.  <p>

		So, to remove the mortgage interest deduction
would create a redistribution from young to old people,
and you, as the Commissioners, I am certain, know.<p>

		Now, one of our major problems is we've been
doing these kind of redistributions for the last two
decades, intentionally by raising real Social Security
benefits, unintentionally raising them through mixups
in the CPI in '82 and other things.  <p>

		We have been transferring resources from young
to the old.  We don't need to do any more of that.<p>

		I've got some more things on my sheet, but I
know we don't have any time, so I'll stop.  		
Thank you very much. 	<p>

<center>	"Comparison of Alternative Plans<p>

and Some Options"</center>
<p>

		<b>MR. ZODROW:</b>:  Thank you very much for inviting
me.  It's my pleasure to be here.<p>

		In my comments, what I'd like to do is discuss
briefly some general principles that economists use in
thinking about tax reform and how some of the various
consumption tax proposals that are out there stack up
against the current income tax in terms of those
criteria; and then also comment briefly on some general
outlines about the three plans that are out there. 
There are some things that you might think about in
reviewing these various proposals.<p>

		Let me begin by noting that there is fairly
widespread, although certainly not unanimous by any
means, agreement among academic economists and, I
think, business economists as well that consumption
taxes meet, generally speaking, the goals of a tax
system more -- they meet it better than an income tax
would, especially our current income tax.<p>

		The first of these goals really is the focus of
this Commission.  And that's the positive effects on
savings, capital formation, economic growth that a
consumption tax system might give rise to, as well as
the associated increases in economic efficiency that
would come from uniform taxation of both investment and
savings.  <p>

		It seems likely that a consumption<p>

based reform would result in some additional savings
and some additional growth, but I should warn you --
and I am sure this will come out in the hearings --
that there is a fair amount of disagreement as to
exactly how large this effect would be.  <p>

		So, I think it's important to think about the
other advantages of consumption taxation as well.<p>

		The second goal is fairness.  The basic
argument here, I think, is just that double taxation of
savings is unfair.  This has been refined in various
ways, but that's the nuts and bolts of it.<p>

		But there are a couple of other dimensions that
I think you have to worry about.  		One is the
obvious one, making the changes big, is that moving to
a consumption tax is going to be complicated if it is
accompanied by a redistribution of the tax burden from
the middle-class, upper-income people. <p>

		And so whether or not you think that's fair I
think is an open issue.  But I think it does complicate
the mix if you have estimates of redistribution
occurring.<p>

		The second is a transitional issue, which is
that any consumption-based tax is going to pretty
favorable to capital owners.  And so it's important, in
thinking about the design, to try to make that
favoritism apply only to new capital and new savings to
the extent possible, and thus try to avoid granting
windfall gains to existing capital owners.<p>

		The third goal of tax reform, I think, would be
just simplicity.  And in my view, this is the most
compelling argument for a consumption tax.  <p>

		Here I really don't refer to the flatness of
the tax, but rather just the calculation of the base,
both at the business level and at the individual level. 
<p>

		There are just a lot of ways in which a
consumption base is inherently simpler than an income
tax base.  The most obvious ones are because it
eliminates issues of timing, it eliminates issues of
inflation accounting.  At the individual level, taxes
are much simpler.<p>

		There are a lot of other ways that one argue
this point, but I think it's an important one to keep
in mind.<p>

		Next, comparison of the three approaches that
are most commonly discussed.  The most obvious would be
a national retail sales tax, the type that's being
advocated by Senator Lugar and Congressman Archer.<p>

		Until recently, I would say that this was not
viewed seriously as a replacement for an income tax,
but it seems to be getting some additional attention. 
The problems primarily are it's very difficult, as Bob
mentioned, to try to get any element of progressivity
into the system.  <p>

		And it's difficult to exempt the purchases of
the poor.  If you start doing so, you basically start
messing up the system.  You start losing the simplicity
that you're striving for.<p>

		Another big difficulty is that a national
retail sales tax, if combined with a state and local
sales tax, is going to give you rates around 30
percent.  <p>

		Presumably you've got everything focused on
that one transaction.  That gives you a lot of
incentives for avoidance.  <p>

		And I think what might happen is that the
monitoring and enforcement efforts that would be
involved could be just as bad as they are and just as
intrusive as they are under the current income tax. <p>

		Finally, the practice now, in terms of the
sales tax, is not too encouraging in that most
estimates suggest that businesses end up paying as much
as 50 percent of the so-called retail sales tax.  If
you do that, you're really losing almost all the
economic advantages of taxation on the basis of
consumption.<p>

		The second approach is typified by the Nunn-Domenici plan, but more generally is just referred to
as a cash flow tax.  There's sort of obviously a tax on
consumption in the sense that you get a deduction for
saving when your withdrawals are taxed, both the
principal and interest if they're consumed.  <p>

		It's a very elegant approach to consumption
taxes.  It has the advantages of being consistent with
some well-known features of the current law, IRAs,
401(k) plans, and such.  And it also appears to be
taxing capital income, although, in fact, not much of
that really happens.<p>

		But the main problem I think with Nunn-Domenici
is it just so complicated, and there are a variety of
schemes that could be used to avoid taxes or at least
defer them for long periods of time.<p>

		The other aspect of it is if you look at the
combined business and individual-level taxes, the top
rate approaches -- the combined rate is like 50
percent.  And I think, in terms of incentives, that's
something one would want to worry about considerably.<p>

		The last approach would be what's referred to
in the economic literature as a tax prepayment
approach, which is more commonly called the Armey or
the Hall-Rabushka flat tax.<p>

		I think it's the simplest approach.  It's
called a consumption tax because the tax burden is
similar, in present value terms, to what would arise
under an obvious consumption tax, even though it looks
more like a tax base they put on wage income and on
pension distributions. <p>

		Since it is an individually based tax, though,
it's easy to make it as progressive as you want.  And
it's easy to exclude low-income individuals from
paying, if that's what you wish to do, as well.<p>

		There is a very interesting problem with this
approach though, and that is that most economic
analyses of a Hall-Rabushka or an <p>

Armey-type plan suggest that the individual cash flow
alternative would lead to much bigger increases in
savings and much bigger increases in economic welfare.<p>

		This happens for two reasons.<p>

		First, under a cash flow tax, you've got to
save more, because you've got to anticipate paying
those future taxes.  <p>

		Now, that can be offset under an Armey plan,
but in order for that to happen, the government has to
save more.  But it just has to use the revenues it gets
earlier and use those to reduce deficits.  Some people
are understandably skeptical that that would happen.<p>

		The second issue is something which Bob alluded
to, and that is under a cash flow approach, effectively
what happens is you have a one-time hit on the owners
of existing assets, typically viewed to be the older
elements of the population.  <p>

		What that means is that you can use those
revenues to reduce future tax rates.  And also, because
you're redistributing from the old -- you know,
speaking in general terms, from the old, who tend to be
consuming, to the young, who are in the savings
portions of their life cycle, you have another impetus
to saving.<p>

		So, both of these tend to give you pretty big
effects under a cash flow approach, which you don't get
under Hall-Rabushka.<p>

		What the latter suggests, I suppose, is that
you want to worry a bit about under the Hall-Rabushka
or Armey plan, about trying to avoid giving a windfall
gain to the elderly or to owners of existing capital
assets, because basically what you do is you'd say,
well, let's forgive expected future taxes on capital
income.  So, you're redistributing income in the other
direction.<p>

		One final point on that issue is just to -- I'm
sure this will come up in the hearings -- is some
people are actually advocating a cash flow approach,
but for this reason.  <p>

		In other words, they're saying, "Well, it's a
good thing to impose a windfall tax on the elderly,
because it reverses some of the effects of the other
fiscal policies that Pat mentioned that have
redistributed income from the younger generations to
older generations.<p>

		I see I'm running out of time.  I'll make one
final point -- <p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  I want to save a half-hour for
questions, so --<p>

		<b>MR. ZODROW:</b>:  Okay.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  We've still got John Anderson.  <p>

		Let me just wrap it up.<p>

		<b>MR. ZODROW:</b>:  Okay.<p>

		Well, why don't I just stop there.  And I'll
leave it --<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  You can also use the time on
the questioning.<p>

<p>

		<b>MR. ANDERSON:</b>  Thank you.    <p>

		Welcome to Nebraska.<p>

		I'd like to comment briefly on the effects and
potential implIcations for state and local governments
--<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Good.<p>

		<b>MR. ANDERSON:</b> -- from a federal tax reform.  <p>

		With some experience in the state and local
arena, I'd like to think through some issue with you
about what might happen if there is a federal reform
and how states are likely to respond.<p>

		Secondly, I'll address the issue of the
potential effects on state and local governments
bending and, finally, say some things about the effects
on the portfolio of taxes that state and local
governments have and how it might be altered with
federal reform.<p>

		First of all, what's the likely effect on state
governments, in terms of how they finance local public
goods and services?<p>

		Well, I think it's pretty clear that states
will generally conform to the federal base changes that
occur.  And I think we can draw on some experience from
the Tax Reform Act of 1986, to see that that's going to
happen.<p>

		States generally moved in the direction of
adapting their income taxes, those that have an income
tax, to the federal base definition.  They vary in
deductions, exemptions, credits, and rate structure, of
course.  But, by and large, states conformed to the
federal definition of "adjusted gross income."		<p>

		If we move in the direction of some kind of
consumption-based tax at the federal level, the
incentive will be there for states to conform to the
base definition, if not the credits and deductions and
exemptions and so on.  At least for the purposes of
defining the base, they're likely to begin with the
federal definition of the base.<p>

		That means that states would have the ability
to define differently the progressivity or regressivity
of their state tax based on how they set deductions,
exemptions, and what kind of credit mechanisms they
might attach to that base.  <p>

		They might have to worry about location effects
and other factors as a result, but it doesn't lock the
states into identical tax systems necessarily.<p>

		Secondly, there are some issues of
deductibility that have to be thought through.<p>

		The current situation on the income tax, where
we've got income and property taxes deductible on the
federal income tax, but sales taxes are not deductible,
is clearly an uneasy compromise between two competing
views of what should happen with deductibility.  <p>

		And a major reform ought to think that through
a little bit more carefully and decide which way to go,
either allow deductibility of all state and local taxes
or disallow them.  <p>

		Perhaps, if you're interested, we can talk
about the relative arguments on both sides of that. 
But the current situation is an uneasy one, where we're
trying to mix two views on deductibility with our
current nondeductibility of sales taxes.<p>

		And secondly, let me say, related to the
deductibility, that a tax reform that lowers marginal
tax rates, of course, reduces the impact of
deductibility in any case.  It doesn't take away the
problem, but it reduces the impact that deductibility
has. <p>

		Deductibility really reduces the differences in
tax prices that are paid across locations for state and
local public goods and services.  <p>

		And a tax reform that eliminates or reduces
deductibility will have the impact of exaggerating
price differences across communities, and that has
clear implications that you may want to think through.<p>

		Finally, related to the federal tax reform and
likely responses from states is the question of
windfall revenues if there is base broadening in any
sense.  We worried about that with the Tax Reform Act
of '86.  We saw what happened.  <p>

		And by and large, there was significant
political pressure to avoid collecting windfalls.  So,
I would presume there would be a similar outcome in
this case.  <p>

		If there's significant base-broadening, the
states are likely to be sensitive to that and avoid
collecting large windfalls.<p>

		What are the effects on state and local
government spending?  Well, here I think the context is
important to think about.  <p>

		Reform of the tax system is being considered
here amid very dramatic changes that are taking place
with respect to federal grant programs as well.  And
the design of the grant mechanisms can greatly affect
state and local spending behavior.  <p>

		Block grants that come have only income
effects.  Matching grants, of course, have both price
effects, substitution effects, as well as income
effects.<p>

		And so what needs to be done is to think
through carefully the combination of a tax reform and a
restructuring of the federal grant system and sending
money back to state and local governments.<p>

		Lower marginal tax rates at the federal level,
together with the potential loss of deductibility,
might raise the tax price for state and local public
goods and result in reduced demand for those goods. 
But the outcome depends crucially on what happens with
redesigning federal grant systems as well. <p>

		Let me conclude by saying there may be effects
on the tax portfolio of state and local governments. 
The long-term trend has been away from property taxes
at the state and local level, especially at the local
level, and toward income and sales taxes.<p>

		Federal tax reform can have direct effects on
the portfolio of revenue sources that state and local
governments rely on.  It may further encourage that
long-term trend, or it may encourage a different
direction.  <p>

		Federal tax reform can also have indirect
effects on tax arbitrage mechanisms on the portfolios
of state and local governments and have an impact that
way as well. <p>

		Well, let me stop there and --<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Thank you.<p>

		<b>MR. ANDERSON:</b>  -- see what questions you may
have.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Thank you.  That's a good place
to turn to Matt Fong, Treasurer of the State of
California.<p>

		Mr. Fong. <p>

		COMMISSIONER FONG:  I'd like to follow up on
some of the state and local issues. California and
other states as well rely principally on a lot
municipal financing to do their infrastructure.<p>

		What impact do you think there would be if we
eliminated the difference between the taxable and the
nontaxable as we are trying to do infrastructure? <p>

		PARTICIPANT:  Well, to the extent that we
reduce marginal tax rates, we would expect the
differential between the taxable and the nontaxable
issues to shrink. <p>

		The question is whether that shrinking by
itself has important implications.<p>

		A tax reform that also has the impact of
stimulating savings might be expected to lower interest
rates in general.  <p>

		And so we're talking about thinking about two
different effects here:  	<p>

		How would tax reform affect the overall level
of interest rates?  <p>

		And how would it affect the differential
between taxable issues and nontaxable issues?<p>

		And the combination of the two things going on
at the same time is quite complex.  But there's no
question if you're moving in the direction of lower
marginal rates, you'd expect the differential to
shrink.  <p>

		That means, for a municipality, that the price
of activity relative to what it would take to go out
and borrow at taxable rates goes up.  So, it becomes
more expensive for municipalities to fund their
projects. <p>

		On the other hand, there may be an impact on
interest rates overall that works in the opposite
direction.  <p>

		And some of the other panelists could certainly
comment on that as well.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Ted.<p>

		MR. FORSTMANN:  Yes.  I wanted to ask a couple
of questions of Professor Hendershott if I could.<p>

		I listened pretty carefully to it,  because I
think this something that's going to come up.  And I
got a little lost, because -- and I have three things
to say here.  <p>

		You were saying that if this deduction were
done away with that equity would be favored or promoted
over debt.  <p>

		But my first question would be -- and maybe
I'll ask them -- all three at the same time.<p>

		My first question would be:  Well, without
arguing that point, isn't debt favored over equity now? 
<p>

		If you're going to get a tax benefit from doing
something in a particular way, you're using debt and
you don't get one from equity, isn't debt favored over
equity now?  And what's good about that?  Number one.<p>

		Number two.  If interest rates are going to
decline by a third, why can't your -- you know, why
can't the young person -- he doesn't get the deduction,
but he pays less for his loan, so why -- what's the
difference?  I don't see the difference.<p>

		So -- and if I'm right, then you must disagree
with Mr. Genetski, that the interest rate is going to
decline.<p>

		And lastly, even if you can answer the first
two questions, when you hear these kinds of horror
stories that you heard today from people -- and we've
been hearing and hearing and hearing, and we'll hear
more of -- and you realize that we've got, you know, a
huge problem to deal with here.<p>

		So even if the first two questions can't be
answered and we are going to favor the elderly over the
young, and we're going to favor equity over debt, and
we're going to do all that stuff relative to what we're
trying to accomplish, if you take the position that if
you allow one -- if you go to some flatter thing and
you allow one deduction to get in, and you know that if
you allow one to get in, the next thing, number two, is
going to show up, and then number three is going to
show up, and you're going to be back where you started,
is it all that important, relative to what we're trying
to accomplish here?<p>

		<b>MR. HENDERSHOTT:</b>  Well, I think there are a lot
of ifs here.  I want to -- but there is one factual or
conceptual issue that you raised, and that is:  Is debt
currently favored relative to equity?<p>

		Now, if you look at the taxation of
corporations, debt is favored relative to equity.  They
get to deduct their interest payments, but they don't
deduct their dividend payments.  And they're paying
taxes on income.<p>

		The difference with owner-occupied housing is
there is no tax on income.  There's no tax on income. 
And for people who equity finance, there's no write-off.  But why write off as long as there isn't a tax? <p>

		But when you talk about debt -- I mean,
basically people like myself are able to invest in
owner-occupied housing and earn a pretax return, a
nontaxable return, and we fund at a pretax cost.  It's
the opportunity cost, the cost of funds.<p>

		But if I invest with debt financing, I earn a
pretax rate of return, but I have to pay this under
current law -- under current law, I get to deduct the
interest, so I finance it with an after-tax yield.  And
the same thing is true if I finance it with equity.<p>

		My opportunity cost to investing my equity in
the house is to invest it in bonds or something where I
would be taxed.  <p>

		So, the opportunity cost of equity financing is
an after-tax yield.  The opportunity cost of debt
financing is an <p>

after-tax cost.  Those are equal.  That's a fair
system, a neutral system.  Take away the mortgage
interest deduction, it won't be neutral anymore.<p>

		Now, we might have to do this again sometime.<p>

		Your other points -- you know, I truly believe
that if we went to a -- if we lower tax rates a lot --
of course, if we lower tax rates a lot, the value of
the mortgage interest deduction goes down also.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Right.<p>

		<b>MR. HENDERSHOTT:</b>  I truly believe if we lower
tax rates, that interest rates will go down.  I don't
believe they're going to go down as much as some other
people might argue.<p>

		There is an alternative view, and that is that
we have world capital markets.  And, in effect, then
the world sets our interest rates.  So, what the hell,
it doesn't make any difference.<p>

		I don't accept that view, but I don't accept
the -- I mean, I've done research myself that suggests
that tax rates do get built into interest rates.  But I
don't think -- they aren't going to fall that much. 
But they will fall.<p>

		Regarding these horror stories -- all right,
the last thing -- you know, we're obviously -- or
you're starting to argue about third best, fourth best. 
<p>

		You know, we can't do things exactly right,
but, no, it certainly is true that there is a -- that
taking away the home mortgage interest deduction,
combined with some other things, might be a good idea. 
I won't deny that.  <p>

		My basic point is that, on its face, taking
away the mortgage interest deduction doesn't make
sense.  <p>

		And if you don't like the tax advantage that
owner-occupied housing has, you should try and get rid
of it some other way.  <p>

		One other way is, of course, lower tax rates,
which means the relative advantage to owner-occupied
housing goes down.  You can take away the property tax
deduction, which I think is a fine idea.  <p>

		You could generally tax other investments less,
like the '81 Tax Act did.  I mean, you can do a lot of
things to take it away.  I don't think the mortgage
interest deduction is the right, but that's --<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  I don't think you and Mr.
Forstmann are all that far off, because you keep
mentioning the marginal tax rate, and the value of the
exemption or deduction or credit goes down relative to
the reduction of the marginal rate.<p>

		What Mr. Forstmann is getting at, if I can be
so bold, is that if we are to get the rates as low as
we possibly can, and reduce the amount of not only
social engineering in the Code but also remove the tax
consequence of investment and saving and income-producing decisions, then I think he is on to
something; that once, if you get the rates as low as
you can, you've got to be careful that you don't start
adding back the problems that will complicate and
frustrate and exacerbate and add all the barriers to
productive economic activity.  <p>

		So, again, we're not prejudging the outcome,
but I think every man and woman on this panel wants to
find a way, within reason, in a political world, to get
the rates on productive human economic activity, i.e.,
working, saving, investing, and engaging in
entrepreneurial <p>

risk-taking -- want to get the rates as low as
possible, get the barriers removed, and let this
country explode into the 21st century.<p>

		John Wieland might have a sympathetic question.<p>

		MR. WIELAND:  Might I just add something?  If
you want to take away the mortgage interest deduction
for second and third homes, you know, that's fine.  But
I think the mortgage interest deduction in our current
Tax Code is a neutrality, rather than a glare.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Well, wait, wait, wait, wait. 
The current Tax Code stinks.  We are here to reform it
and change it and write a new one.  So --<p>

		MR. WIELAND:  I know.  I'm saying this aspect
of the current Tax Code is an appropriate aspect, given
the rest of the Code.  <p>

		And if you stick with the current Code, even if
you can --<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  In the current Code --<p>

		MR. WIELAND:  -- lower tax rates to the point --<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  In the current Code, the
interest deduction on a mortgage is sacrosanct --
sacrosanct.  It is sacred.<p>

		MR. WIELAND:  Well --<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  I'm the Housing Secretary.  <p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		But we're not here --<p>

		MR. WIELAND:  You were the Housing --<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  -- to defend the status quo.  <p>

		Reagan used to say, "'Status quo" is a Latin
phrase for the mess we're in."'  <p>

		And we're in a mess.<p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		We're going to get out of it.<p>

		So, Mr. Wieland.<p>

		MR. WIELAND:  Dr. Hendershott, I like your
analysis.  <p>

		I have two questions at this point.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Disputatious Commissioner.<p>

		MR. WIELAND:  The first is I would assume that
young people don't need really big houses.  So, if
we're going to, you know, eliminate this transfer from
the young to the old, you know, you said second homes
wouldn't need to be protected.  What caps would you
set, or would you set caps?	<p>

		<b>MR. HENDERSHOTT:</b>  I'm not sure that I would set
any caps at all.  <p>

		I think we -- I mean, young -- I mean, you
mentioned that young households don't need big houses. 
Well, nobody needs a big house.  		We're talking
about people being able to consume the resources they
have.  There may be some very-high-income young people
who should be having big houses, and they're going to
have to fund it with a lot of debt.  <p>

		When you start putting caps on, you're really -- you're trying to change the distribution of taxes in
the U.S. is what you're basically trying to do.  <p>

		And if you think that young people -- or,
excuse me, if you think that high-income people don't
pay enough taxes, you ought to tax them more heavily. 
I'm not sure the way to do it is to cap their interest
deduction.  So, I would not put caps on.<p>

		MR. WIELAND:  Second question.  First of all,
I'd like to say that you were described to me as the
best housing economist in the United States.  So, I
value your insights --<p>

		<b>MR. HENDERSHOTT:</b>  Well, I'd like to know who
the -- who made that statement.  I would send them a
Christmas card.<p>

		MR. WIELAND:  If people were convinced that the
mortgage interest deduction should go, what thoughts
would you have as to the transition aspects of people
who presently have mortgages?<p>

		<b>MR. HENDERSHOTT:</b>  That is a tough question that
I haven't thought a lot about.  There ought to be some
transitional thing.  I would certainly worry about
that. <p>

		On the other hand, if interest rates are going
to fall, you need less transition.  And also, there are
a number of people who probably, if you took away their
mortgage interest deduction, would find ways to have a
smaller mortgage.  <p>

		They currently have marketable assets they
could use to pay off their other mortgages, but there
just isn't an incentive under today's Tax Code.  <p>

		I can't -- I'll be glad to think about that,
but I don't want to answer it.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  We asked some of the people in
the audience if they would like to ask a question.  <p>

		And so any one of you --<p>

		Let me just make a couple of questions on their
behalf, and then treat it any way you possibly can.<p>

		First of all, from Rosalie Shepherd (phonetic),
not a question but a comment.  She is the director of
United We Stand America -- here in Nebraska I assume.  <p>

		And she wants us all to come to the national
conference in Dallas from August 11th to the 13th,
where this will be a main topic of the United We Stand
America people.  <p>

		They've got Bob Dole, Newt Gingrich, Phil
Gramm, Dick Gephardt, and other top <p>

policy-makers and a lot of grassroots folks.<p>

		So that's a plug for -- Rosalie, you left off
your 1-800 number.  Ross would be very upset that you
left off the 1-800 number. <p>

		I think it's Don or Dan Bartley (phonetic). <p>

		PARTICIPANT:  Don.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Don.  <p>

		And this -- you addressed it a little bit, Bob
Genetski.<p>

		How do we remove the social engineering aspects
of the tax system?  How do we get the cleanest system
to raise revenue for government's legitimate functions
and not get into the social engineering that now is
implicit -- in some cases explicit -- in the Tax Code? <p>

		And as you're thinking about that, one of the
ways in '81 we tried to remove the poor from the Tax
Code and deal with the payroll tax, alluded to so
eloquently in our earlier panel, was the earned income
tax credit.<p>

		Take those two questions, social engineering
and removing the poor from the burden of the payroll
tax by increasing the earned income tax credit.  And,
of course, this is phased out.  It leads to a high
marginal rate at a certain point, so those are two
questions that can be addressed by the panel.<p>

		Thank you.<p>

		<b>MR. GENETSKI:</b>  Yes.  And I think --<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  That was just to get the name
of the -- Pat O'Malley (phonetic) from Tax Help asked
the question of how many values are destroyed by
phasing in and out of the earned income tax credit.<p>

		Go ahead, Bob.  Excuse me.<p>

		<b>MR. GENETSKI:</b>  It seems to me that the Armey
bill deals with that in the simplest, most effective
way, by getting the tax down to a flat rate for
everyone; and then allowing for a significant
deduction, so that anyone making up to, say, $35,000
doesn't have to pay tax.  <p>

		And then the 17 percent starts to come in after
that, a family of four gets that.<p>

		That seems to be the most straightforward,
simplest way.  And everyone can understand what's
happening, and you do away with the social engineering
and the very high marginal tax rates associated with
people getting government benefits.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  George.<p>

		<b>MR. ZODROW:</b>:  Well, I'd just like to note that
as far as the earned income tax credit, is to relate it
to a comment that was made earlier.  The earned income
tax credit, I think, was instituted with all kinds of
good motives.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Yes.<p>

		<b>MR. ZODROW:</b>:  But one of the side effects has
been that it dramatically increases the marriage
penalties on low-income households.<p>

		Some of the marriage penalties -- you have to
set the example up right, but if you do, and then you
have the right people getting married, the marriage
penalties are just horrendous, especially relative to
the tax burdens that the family would pay.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  I'm glad that the motives were
not challenged, because I was one of the co-authors of
the earned income tax credit because I realized there
were so many low-income people moving into their first
job at Herman Cain's pizza factory --<p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		-- or anyplace else faced a marginal tax rate
of unbelievable -- the highest rate of taxation in the
country was a low-income woman trying to take a job
with a child or two or a father who's unemployed who
takes his first job.<p>

		So, is the answer, Bob, to social engineering,
just get simplicity of a flatter, fairer, simpler,
lower rate system and then exempt the poor by using the
personnel exemption?<p>

		<b>MR. GENETSKI:</b>  That would be my answer.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Yes.  Up to -- did you have a
question?<p>

		PARTICIPANT:  Well, follow-up to that.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Go, go.  You're on.<p>

		PARTICIPANT:  You started to mention earlier,
but you didn't get a chance, since you had mentioned
the flat tax, and you said that was a criticism that
you had of Hall-Rabushka.  <p>

		Could you comment on that --<p>

		<b>MR. GENETSKI:</b>  Yes, yes.<p>

		PARTICIPANT:  -- since we are talking about
that?<p>

		<b>MR. GENETSKI:</b>  Yes, the -- in <p>

Hall-Rabushka, they try to avoid dealing with the
payroll taxes, because that's a whole different ball
game from the income tax.  And you really chew up an
awful lot just in dealing with the income tax alone.<p>

		But they are forced to deal with it, because it
is such a big factor, and at least recommend how they
would incorporate dealing with the payroll tax into
their flat tax system.  And they've got two possible
ways of solving the problem. <p>

		One is to treat Social Security -- or the
payroll portion -- as a pension, allow business to
deduct the tax that business has to pay and then tax
the people who receive Social Security benefits.  <p>

		They chose not to do that.  They chose to treat
the payroll tax as if it were a fringe benefit, and
therefore not to allow business to deduct the payroll
tax, but then have people who receive the Social
Security benefits receive them tax-free.  <p>

		This, to me, is the wrong decisions for a
couple of reasons.<p>

		First, I believe it puts a tremendous
additional benefit or cost on businesses, when you
clearly have to pay this item out.  It's not like a
fringe benefit, where you can raise wages in return for
that.<p>

		Also -- and this is a very important point for
those who eventually believe and would like to see
Social Security changed along the lines it has been
done in Chile -- the more you treat the Social Security
system as a pension, it appears to me the easier it's
going to be to make that transition.  <p>

		The more you treat it as some sort of a fringe
benefit, I think the more difficult it's going to be to
achieve that.<p>

		PARTICIPANT:  Thank you.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Commissioner Kleckner.<p>

		COMMISSIONER KLECKNER:  For any of you, but
maybe Bob Geneski and George Zodrow, you commented
earlier -- well, all of you did -- on the -- maybe the
ease of taxation or the -- in my words, "a hidden tax
versus a hurting tax." <p>

		You know, tax withholding for income tax
reasons, you're either on salary, your tax is withheld,
all the employees' tax is withheld.  		Our
employees at American Farm Bureau, 100 or so that we
have, really don't know how much money -- they know
what they get in their check, but they don't know the
total that they get, compared to a small businessman or
a farmer that has to write that check once a year or
twice a year, or whatever.  So, we know it's hurting.  <p>

		Your views on hidden taxes versus hurting
taxes, which are more transparent.  And also the idea
of tax withholding.  <p>

		If Shirley Peterson were here -- and I know she
regretted she had to leave -- but the IRS perspective
is you've got to withhold or people can't pay or won't
pay.<p>

		I tend to agree with Shirley, but on this one,
heck, farmers pay all the time or we go to jail.  And
we pay by the 1st of March, not April 15th, mainly.<p>

		I wanted, when I became American Farm Bureau
president, to pay our employees just one check a year -- wanted to start out once every quarter, went to once
every six months, and once a year, give them their
whole check, and maybe even withhold some so that they
wouldn't have to get anything back.  <p>

		I proposed doing it in December, give them a
little extra check at Christmastime, or a bigger check,
whole check, and "This is what you're really earning
before all the withholding."  <p>

		I was told we couldn't do it.  It's illegal.  I
guess we'd have gone to jail if we had tried to do it.  <p>

		But the idea -- are we to the point where we
got to withhold or the whole tax structure of the
country collapses, IRS goes into orbit if we don't
withhold, because we'll all go to jail or not?  What do
you think?<p>

		Anybody?  <p>

		George.<p>

		<b>MR. ZODROW:</b>:  Well, I think the main advantage
of withholding is just a present value issue.  If
everybody were to wait until the end of the year, then
it just would be a matter of higher rates that would
have to be assessed in order to get the same present
value of revenues to the government.<p>

		In terms of the visibility of the taxes or the
extent to which the role that the tax structure plays
in terms of the overall level of government
expenditures, I don't think there's actually that much
difference between the various approaches.  <p>

		It's more a situation where, I think, that if
you were to, say, load up with the sales tax.  People
say the sales tax is hidden and for that reason it
would tend to lead to bigger government.  <p>

		If you had a sales tax, a national sales tax of
21, 22 percent; and you had state sales taxes, 5, 6, 8
percent; local taxes, maybe 1 or 2 percent on top of
that, people would notice that.<p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		That's not a tax which would be a hidden tax.<p>

		The same thing applies, I think, to income
taxes.  People sometime say that withholding is a means
of a hidden tax.  And I suppose there's some validity
to that.  But everyone has to fill out their tax
return, and everyone sees that bottom line.  And it's
hard to imagine, really, that that is that much of a
hidden tax.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  That's the question that
Richard <b>MR. SCHENKEN:</b> (phonetic), who's in our audience, asked
about, the visibility of the tax.<p>

		Bob, do you want to take a shot at this whole
question of transparency and visibility and --<p>

		<b>MR. GENETSKI:</b>  Well, just as a <p>

general --<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  -- can we keep the government
from demanding more and more and more?<p>

		<b>MR. GENETSKI:</b>  I would say, just as a general
principle of good taxation, that the tax system,
whatever it is, should be a transparent as possible.  <p>

		Now, the problem is, is it going to end up
being more work, more time, more effort to have the
employee write out the check, send it to the
government?  Is that more paperwork?  And does it
really pay in the end?  Or to just have the employer
take it out? <p>

		One way or another, you're balancing
transparency with the costs, the additional costs
involved.  And I'm not sure the additional costs are
worthwhile.  But whatever tax system you come up with,
I think it should be as transparent as possible so that
people very obviously know what they're paying.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Pat, do you want to make a
comment on that?<p>

		<b>MR. HENDERSHOTT:</b>  Yes.  I think  withholding is
obviously here to stay.  But the thing I really object
to in the Tax Code, probably more than anything, is
this hidden marginal tax rate, where you're phasing out
the personal exemptions, the standard deduction.  What
a crock.  <p>

		I mean, to be able to argue that our marginal
tax rates are low and this is going on -- I mean, this
is just really -- <p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  We can put you down as a strong
view on that subject.<p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		<b>MR. ZODROW:</b>:  I don't feel strongly about that
though.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Yes, right.<p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		Well, that aroma that is weaving its way
through this room is that of the finest pizza --<p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		-- in the Midwest.<p>

		PARTICIPANT:  In the world.<p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  The Western Judeo-Christian
civilization.<p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		Klaus Beck (phonetic), our last question, asked
something that I think is critical to our
deliberations.<p>

		Hypothetically now, once we get a new system --
again, big hypothesis -- I believe it can be done, and
I believe the '96 election will be fought out over
these issues.  Okay?  That's what we believe.  <p>

		That's why we're doing this work.  There isn't
anybody here who is getting anything personal out of
this.  We're not seeking anything.  We're not being
paid.  <p>

		But how do you lock it in?  How do we lock in
the principle that the government should raise
legitimate revenues efficiently, effectively, with the
least burden on the poor and those least able to bear
that burden, but not consume our income?  <p>

		How do we -- do we have a constitutional
amendment?  Do we have a national referendum?<p>

		What would be your advice -- real quick -- on
how to lock in -- as much as humanly, politically
possible -- a 21st century Tax Code for American?  <p>

		Any comments?<p>

		PARTICIPANT:  I'd say a super-majority to raise
taxes --<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  In the Congress?	<p>

		PARTICIPANT:  In Congress or to -- and by
raising taxes, I mean increasing tax <p>

breaks --<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Yes.<p>

		PARTICIPANT:  -- and all this kind of thing.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Dick Gephardt came out for a
national referendum.  I thought that was interesting. <p>

		John?  Or George?  Or Bob?<p>

		PARTICIPANT:  Well, let me just make one quick
comment, which is that the national referendum or the
super majority, or whatever it might be, I think really
should apply to issues of base.  <p>

		I think most people think in terms of rates,
and let's hold a cap on rates.  But rates presumably
are going to fluctuate, depending on international and
national conditions, and even taste regarding public
services.     <p>

		I think the critical feature here, though, is
the change in the base.  If you're successful in
getting a truly pure base, if you will, then that is
the item which I think you need to focus on in terms of
designing your super-majorities.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Bob.<p>

		<b>MR. GENETSKI:</b>  Yes.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  Any comment?  We're going to --<p>

		<b>MR. GENETSKI:</b>  No, I'm not a big fan of
constitutional amendments.  I think we might have too
many.  I'd like to take the -- what is it, the
allowance of the income tax, 16th Amendment?  I'd like
to take that out.  But other than that, Congress has so
many ways of circumventing whatever amendment that you
put.<p>

		Just -- again, putting the burdens of whatever
it wants to do directly on business, instead of running
it through the tax system, has been their latest ploy.  <p>

		It's really a question of good will more than
anything else.  <p>

		And the one thing that happens, if you go to
the flat tax system, is you switch a heck of a lot of
power and influence away from Congress.<p>

		PARTICIPANTS:  Away from politicians?<p>

		<b>MR. GENETSKI:</b>  From politicians.  <p>

		And you're -- essentially -- and this is one of
the challenges -- you're asking those politicians to
give up something that they hold near and dear.<p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		And as a result of that, the arguments in favor
of a flat tax have to be overwhelming to overcome that
huge objection.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  I mentioned in the last hearing
-- in Boston, I think -- that a city councilman in Hong
Kong -- I made no secret of the fact that I had been an
admirer of the <p>

Hong Kong economic miracle.  The last city councilman
who advocated doing away with the <p>

15 percent flat income tax in Hong Kong lost his seat,
overwhelmingly.<p>

		Thanks for you being here, Bob, and Pat.  Thank
you, George, John.  Appreciate a view from the groves
of academe.<p>

		I would invite my fellow Commissioners to step
over to the podium.  We're going to do a little press
availability to let some of our friends in the press
get back at us after those vicious attacks, ad hominem
--<p>

		(Laughter)<p>

		-- on the press.<p>

		And then we'll, at 12:30 sharp, have a pizza
lunch.<p>

		Thank you all for being here.<p>

		PARTICIPANT:  Thank you.<p>

		<b>CHAIRMAN KEMP:</b>  And we appreciate the good
questions from our audience.<p>

		Thank you.<p>

		(Applause)<p>

		(Whereupon, at approximately 12:20 p.m., the NATIONAL COMMISSION ON ECONOMIC GROWTH
AND TAX REFORM PUBLIC HEARING was adjourned.)<p>
