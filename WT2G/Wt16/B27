<H3><B>White Paper heralds change</B></H3>
<P>

Proposals which could change the way community pharmacy services are provided and paid for are published this week in a White Paper, 'Choice and opportunity - primary care: the future'. 
<P>
A second White Paper, to be published towards the end of the year, will set out practical measures aimed to support primary care professionals. The Government's legislative programme will be outlined in the Queen's Speech on October 23.
<P>
Health secretary Stephen Dorrell says: ''For community pharmacists, the proposed changes will mean that regulations need no longer act as a ceiling to professional development.'' 
<P>
The White Paper says that during the past year's debate on the future development of primary care, several themes emerged for taking community pharmacy forward. These include: 
<li>making better use of prescribed medicines <br>
<li>wider recognition of community pharmacy as the first port of call for minor ailments<br>
<li>health promotion<br>
<li>providing more advice on medicines to the primary care team and others.
<P>
One of the most significant barriers to these developments is the way current legislation constrains the range and standards of services and prevents them being tailored to local needs.  Pharmacists are obliged to meet national standards - no more and no less - so regulations can act as a ceiling to service developments as there is no legal basis for requiring a different level of service, the White Paper says. 
<P>
In addition, any pharmacy meeting these requirements can provide any service, which could cut across local needs, making financial planning difficult and possibly making the service not cost-effective. Health authorities have no power to make arrangements for services with a pharmacy outside their boundaries. Proposed legislation will allow them to decide which, where and how much of the prescribed service to purchase while sticking to a basic framework and only purchasing from NHS community pharmacy.  
<P>
NHS community pharmacies could apply to provide these services from a local or neighbouring health authority. Patients' rights to take NHS prescriptions to the pharmacy of their choice would not be affected, nor would the legal controls and standards surrounding dispensing.
<P>
The secretary of state will set out the services which health authorities can buy locally. These might include help for individual patients or services directed at groups of patients or carers. Set criteria will ensure that services are to be provided only by those competent to do so.
<P>
The local services might also involve providing help and advice on medicines to other healthcare staff, within a framework of national minimum service standards. For example, a pharmacist providing medication review might be required to assess patients' medication in line with nationally specified criteria and to liaise with the GP. 
<P>
Health authorities could decide whether they wished to set their own guidelines and could prioritise services for different patient groups. The authorities could also consider how much of these services they wished to purchase, what local specifications to include and how much they proposed to pay.
<P>
The secretary of state will be able to set out the criteria to be followed in making these decisions, although the emphasis will be on meeting local priorities and needs. Where authorities are buying services under Part I of the NHS Act 1977, such as needle and syringe exchange, they are obliged to use legally enforceable contracts. This has sometimes discouraged them from considering pharmacists as potential providers, the White Paper claims. 
<P>
The Government believes there will be benefits in making these arrangements through NHS contracts, which are usually simpler and not enforceable by law, although they are subject to binding arbitration by the secretary of state.

<P>
<A HREF="#top">Top of page</A>
<HR>

<A NAME="b"></A>
<H3><B>New types of GP contract</B></H3>
<P>

The Government intends to introduce legislation enabling different types of GP contract to be piloted, although there are no plans to change the basic arrangements for dispensing (by pharmacists or dispensing doctors) or prescribing. 
<P>
Health authorities will also be able to make extra payments locally for GPs to develop specific medical services; the payments will come from the general cash limited services for hospital and community health services. The White Paper comments that there are great opportunities for GPs to develop a wider range of services in primary care and that the distinction between what constitutes general medical services and provision of other services in a general practice setting is becoming increasingly blurred. 
<P>
The present contract does not always promote the opportunities for GPs to combine with other professions, the paper says.
<P>
<li>The Independent on Tuesday said the proposals would leave the door open for private retailers to offer NHS family doctor clinics in shopping malls. It claims a 'leaked' background document shows that ministers plan to allow a wide definition of those who may offer GP services in pilot schemes, in that GPs or 'other organisations' could apply to provide personal medical services.

<P>
<A HREF="#top">Top of page</A>

<A NAME="c"></A>
<H3><B>Proposals welcomed</B></H3>
<P>

The White Paper could open the way for patients and other health professionals to gain much improved access to pharmacists' advice on all aspects of medicines and their use, comments the Royal Pharmaceutical Society. 
<P>
The president, Ian Caldwell, has broadly welcomed proposals to create incentives for health authorities to purchase a wider range of NHS pharmacy services.
<P>
''Pharmacy as a profession has shown its commitment to playing a fuller part in primary care: what we now need are the financial resources for pharmacy to deliver the new services,'' he says.
<P>
''Patients have the right to expect high-quality pharmaceutical services wherever they live. We have concerns that these proposals could create anomalies in terms of standards,'' he says.
<P>
''The Society will be pressing for national standards for these services to be established by the professional body and for input into discussions on the range of additional pharmaceutical services from which local authorities may select.'' 
<P>
Mr Caldwell added that he would be seeking reassurance that the proposals would not undermine local provision of services: ''The success of the local community pharmacy network is based on the fact that patients trust and benefit from the flexibility of locally-based pharmacy services.''
<P>
The Society welcomed the assurance that patients would still have freedom of choice of pharmacy for dispensing.

<H3><B>£100k for research project</B></H3>
<P>

A sum of £100,000 is to be made available for work into the largest-ever research programme about community pharmacy. 'Pharmacists practising in a community pharmacy environment improve the overall health of the nation' is the basis of the joint research initiative put forward by a consortium of pharmacy organisations.
<P>
The consortium is made up from the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, the National Pharmaceutical Association, the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee, the Scottish Pharmaceutical General Council and the Company Chemists' Association. The move follows a joint statement of intent by the five organisations, saying they were ''committed to the principle of developing a strong research base to underpin future developments of practice and policy in relation to community pharmacy''.
<P>
Research will focus on the public's use of community pharmacy as a primary healthcare source. It will also examine the role of pharmacists and their potential within the primary healthcare team.

<H3><B>Views to be aired over 'employee union'</B></H3>
<P>

Employee pharmacists and locums are being asked for views on issues that could be tackled by an independent association of employee pharmacists. One possible topic for discussion at a meeting on November 17 is whether any new association should be affiliated to a trade union. 
<P>
Pharmacists who register for the meeting, to be held at the Strathallan Thistle Hotel, Edgbaston, Birmingham, from 2.00-5.00pm, will be sent a questionnaire to stimulate discussion on key issues affecting locums and employees. Representatives from the Guild of Hospital Pharmacists will talk about the services the Guild provides and its affiliation with the MSF union.
<P>
The Royal Pharmaceutical Society is facilitating the meeting, but Nicola Gray, chairman of the Community Pharmacists' Group, says it will be up to those present to decide whether to form an independent association and how it should operate. Further details are available from Ms Janet Flint, practice division, RPSGB, 1 Lambeth High Street, London SE1 7JN. Employees and locums unable to attend the meeting are welcome to apply for a questionnaire so their views can be heard.
<P>
<li>The Young Pharmacists' Group has invited the TUC's general secretary, John Monks, to its annual meeting on October 26-27. YPG spokesman Joel Hirst told <EM>C&amp;D</EM> it might make sense for an employee association to affiliate with a union which could address remuneration, working conditions and hours of service.

<H3><B>Outreach project for Norfolk</B></H3>
<P>

Norfolk pharmacists are taking part in a £30,000 pharmacy outreach project, making domiciliary visits to patients referred by GPs, social services and other healthcare professionals. 
<P>
The pharmacists make an initial home visit to discuss with the patient or carer the medicines being taken, the importance of taking them and the correct storage. They devise a pharmaceutical care plan and refer problems to the doctor or social worker. After a few weeks, the pharmacists call again to review the situation.
<P>
Norfolk Social Services is funding the six to eight-month pilot, which is being run in collaboration with North West Anglia and East Norfolk Health Authorities and Norfolk Local Pharmaceutical Committee. If the initial project is successful, social services hopes to attract funding from the HAs to continue and expand the scheme. 
<P>
The nine pharmacists each received £150 to cover a six-hour CPPE training course and attendance at other meetings. The initial one and a half-hour consultation attracts £15 an hour for the pharmacist and £15 an hour for a locum, plus travelling expenses. There is a £20 fee for the half-hour follow-up and £20 if monitored dosage systems are provided.
<P>
Norfolk LPC secretary, Pam Meakin, told <EM>C&amp;D</EM> it was expecting to help about 20 patients per pharmacy, mostly the elderly, people with learning difficulties or those with mental illness.
<P>
Tim Hawley, service development officer for adult care at Norfolk Social Services, explains: ''The project has been set up to help clients who are at risk of losing the independence of living at home because they find taking complex amounts of medicine too confusing and may be putting themselves at risk.''

<H3><B>Patient packs delay</B></H3>
<P>

No firm date has yet been agreed for the official start of the patient pack initiative. The patient pack joint working group, which represents all interested parties, reconvened last week to review the current position. The Royal Pharmaceutical Society's representative, Roger Odd, told<EM> C&amp;D</EM> it was hoped that a target date might be set in a document to be published at the end of this month, giving joint proposals on how the scheme should progress. 
<P>
The health minister, Gerald Malone, said recently that the dispensing and reimbursement arrangements, which would make the initiative effective for patients, could not be phased in until February or March, 1997. Mr Odd thought the main reason for delay was the Department of Health's concern over costs, as well as lack of agreement over pack sizes.
<P>
 Progress was being made in several areas, but there was still a lot of work to be done. The working party had tentatively agreed that, when the scheme was ready to go forward, there would be an updated launch to inform the public, industry and professions.
<P>
Pharmacists were now concerned that delays were causing shortages of some drugs, he added.

<H3><B>Sants link with George Foster</B></H3>
<P>

Sants and George Foster, the independent wholesalers based in north England, have become partners to strengthen their position in the market. Foster is a full-line pharmaceutical wholesaler that serves north west England from a single depot in Burnley. Sants covers the North West and West Midlands from its 48,000sq ft depot in Newcastle-under-Lyme. Both deal with about 1,000 independent pharmacists.
<P>
Under the agreement, Foster has the option of acquiring just under 50 per cent of Sants' shares. It can take this up anytime between January 1 and June 30 next year. Foster has offered to lend Sants £250,000. The latter says it could use the loan as working capital and to upgrade its computer systems.
<P>
Gerald Brooks, Sants' chairman and chief executive, says the partners have been close since 1991, but they began negotiating this agreement at the beginning of the year. Foster's annual sales are estimated at £60 million, which is much more than those of Sants, but the latter claims it has the largest independent wholesale warehouse in the UK with considerable excess capacity.
<P>
Mr Brooks says the partnership makes sense, given the climate of concentration in the pharmaceutical wholesale market. ''I think it's in the interest of the market to have a strong, independent wholesale operation on this side of the UK,'' he says. The partners are not interested in diversifying into retail pharmacies, he adds, but will concentrate on their core wholesaling strengths. Both will benefit from synergy. ''There's scope for shared management expertise and we'll co-operate to develop our strategy.''
<P>
While Mr Brooks does not rule out a merger between the two, he says it is unlikely in the short-term. Other independent wholesalers, he adds, ought to consider doing something similar. ''We've heard so much talk about the need for a third wholesaling force in the UK, but the UK already has such a force - independent wholesalers.''

Block Drug Company, Stafford-Miller's US parent, has acquired Piriton from Glaxo Wellcome for an undisclosed sum. Stafford-Miller says the acquisition takes effect from the beginning of November and it aims to launch an advertising campaign for the brand early next year.
<P>
Piriton joins the company's growing OTC portfolio, which includes Settlers, acquired last year from Smithkline Beecham, and Nytol. Pharmacists with further queries should contact their Stafford-Miller representative or the company on 01707 331001.

<H3><B>New Acts will increase red tape</B></H3>
<P>

Three new Acts coming into effect in the next few months are set to add to the volumes of red tape affecting small businesses. Under the Immigration &amp; Asylum Act, which comes into effect at the beginning of January, pharmacists who employ foreign pre-registration graduates (even if they have trained at a UK school of pharmacy) have to ensure that people they recruit are allowed to work in the UK. 
<P>
They are advised to ask for documentation - such as a P45, national insurance card, birth certificate or passport - before taking on employees. Employers who take on illegal immigrants face a fine of up to £5,000.
<P>
The Disability Discrimination Act 1995, which becomes effective on December 2, makes it unlawful to discriminate against disabled people in terms of recruitment, and contract and employment. 
<P>
Discrimination in the following areas will be unlawful: mobility, manual dexterity, physical co-ordination, continence, ability to lift, carry or otherwise move everyday objects, speech, hearing or eyesight, memory or the ability to concentrate, to learn or to understand. 
<P>
Under the health and safety law, employers are now required to consult employees on health and safety matters. This means that regular meetings with employees are required.

<H3><B>Boots to plough £37.6m into new overseas stores</B></H3>
<P>

Boots' overseas expansion has begun with a vengeance, with a pilot store scheme set for Thailand, the Netherlands and Japan. New shops are also planned in the Republic of Ireland. The company is investing £30 million over the next 18 months for its pilot stores. 
<P>
For the Thai market, it has formed a joint venture with the Minor Group, a company with in-depth knowledge of Thailand's retail market, to open four stores in Bangkok and one in Pattaya. Boots expects the outlets to be completed by next summer. 
<P>
Each will be 150-700sq m in size and the layout will resemble closely those in the UK. All will have a pharmacy, which will handle prescription and OTC medicines. They will also stock a wide range of fragrances, cosmetics and toiletries. The Thai partnership will be headed by Martyn Bell, previously merchandise and marketing director of Halfords, a Boots' subsidiary.
<P>
Boots will open three outlets in the Netherlands, where it has an agreement with Eerstelijns Voorzieningen Almere to provide in-store pharmacy services, including prescriptions and OTC medicines. EVA provides primary healthcare for the Almere region. Boots' Dutch stores will resemble their Thai equivalents, but their average size will be 1,000sq m, one-fifth of which will be devoted to pharmacy. The operation will be led by Peter Stone, formerly director of store planning at Boots the Chemists. 
<P>
The company is expected to announce its plans for Japan shortly.

<H3><B>Fotostop unveils its ambitious expansion plans</B></H3>
<P>

The Fotostop Group plans to increase its sales to £30 million by 1999, following a multi-million pound deal with Lloyds Development Capital - the venture capital arm of Lloyds Bank. Under the agreement, LDC has lent Fotostop several million pounds, although the exact figure remains confidential, and has taken a minority stake in the company. 
<P>
Charles Gabriele, Fotostop's co-owner, has partly used the cash to buy out his partner, Mario Swanston. Mr Gabriele is now group managing director and, with Cathal Maye, assistant group managing director, heads a new team of managers. The rest of the money will finance an expansion plan - about 330 retailers currently use Fotostop's minilab facilities and accessories.
<P>
Clive John, a director at LDC, says its research suggests that Fotostop is a worthwhile investment. ''We're very selective in the investments we make, and we looked long and hard at the business [Fotostop] before we decided on the investment.''

<H3><B>Unichem's spectacle scheme</B></H3>
<P>

Unichem is rolling out a spectacle dispensing service for independent pharmacists, following a successful pilot scheme in Guildford and Hull. Delegates at the company's convention in Bermuda have already received a sneak preview of the service
<P>
Spectacle sales are annually worth about £700 million and are growing by 7 per cent every year, according to Unichem. Its pilot involved seven pharmacies in Guildford and ten in Hull. These could make a 50 per cent profit on return by dispensing spectacles, says Unichem. By selling two spectacles a week, a pharmacist's annual profits could exceed £1,500, and the wholesaler claims many could exceed that figure. 
<P>
Each pilot pharmacist had a one-metre stand featuring 60 different pairs of spectacles, whose prices ranged from about  £20-50. When a customer arrived with a prescription, the pharmacist would make a measurement and send the information to a central laboratory. The finished spectacles were posted back to the pharmacist within 48 hours. 
<P>
Unichem backed the pilot with in-store promotions, leaflet drops and advertisements in local papers. This marketing support accounted for about 50 per cent of the pilot's spectacle sales. 
<P>
Martyn Ward, Unichem's director of sales and marketing, says customers responded well to the new service. ''After all, if you can trust your pharmacist to dispense medicines, it's a small step to visiting your pharmacy for a new pair of glasses,'' he says. 
<P>
The spectacles' prices are vitally important. ''Our aim is not to pit pharmacists against opticians in a head-on battle. Clearly, opticians are qualified to perform eye tests and write prescriptions for spectacles. We're enabling pharmacists to dispense a pair of top-quality spectacles using a prescription from a qualified optician, at a much lower price,'' he says. 
<P>
Unichem's roll-out is based on geographic regions, which have yet to be announced. Interested pharmacists should contact their local account managers. 
<P>
The company has set up a specialist wholesale division, called Univision, for its new venture. This will be managed by Bob Forgan, a manufacturing optician; Michael Apps, a dispensing optician; Mr Ward; Mark Thomas, Unichem's director of corporate development; and Steve Duncan, Moss Chemists' marketing director.

<H3><B>Colourcare puts £10m into new technology</B></H3>
<P>

Colourcare plans to invest £10 million by the end of 1998 on new equipment and technology. The photo processing specialist, which deals with about 4,500 independent retailers, including pharmacies, says it is preparing itself for the reviving UK market. Between 1989 and 1994, the photo processing market's sales shrank by 12 million films, equivalent to about 25 per cent of its value. However, sales are picking up again and are expected to grow further with the relaunch of the Advanced Photo System for cameras and film processing - scheduled in time for the peak Christmas and New Year period - and the expansion of digital imaging technology.
<P>
APS, developed by the five major camera manufacturers, essentially involves new types of cameras and films that provide much better results than conventional 35mm versions. APS customers are also given a contact sheet that bears miniature reproductions of their photos, enabling them to choose prints for repeat orders. 
<P>
The system was originally launched in March/April, but failed because the manufacturers had not produced enough film and cameras to meet global demands. Colourcare says the manufacturers are now better prepared. By 1999, it says, APS cameras and film should account for 20-25 per cent of the UK photo processing market. 
<P>
APS is about 50 per cent more expensive than 35mm and it has enormous profit potential for pharmacists, according to Jim Brown, Colourcare's managing director. Pharmacies need invest only a fraction on staff training and marketing. They can still take in both 35mm and APS film for processing, he says.

<H3><B>Society urged to adopt Which? 'spy' tactics</B></H3>
<P>
The Royal Pharmaceutical Society is being urged to adopt the covert surveillance tactics of Which? magazine to audit and monitor compliance with OTC sales protocols.
<P>
A motion submitted by Bristol & District Branch for debate at this year's Branch Representatives meeting asks the Society to introduce the system to "defend the integrity of the majority of pharmacists."
<P>
In total, ten motions are up for debate at the May 16 meeting, with a further nine to be referred straight to Council. Those for debate include:
<UL>
<LI> the British Pharmaceutical Students Association wanting continuing education to be a requirement of continuing registration 
<LI> the East Metropolitan Branch  calling for a staggered introduction of the four-year course over three years from autumn 1997, with one-third of schools changing in each of the years
<LI> York & District wanting the law to be amended to require all items dispensed in a dispensing doctor practice, other than by a doctor, to be checked by a doctor or, ideally, by a pharmacist
<LI> Glasgow & West of Scotland wanting the Council to reconfirm the functions of the Branch structure and to debate the possibility of widening its function to fulfil and maintain Pharmacy in a New Age initiatives.
</UL>
<P>
Among the undebated motions are calls to seek urgent legislation for the immediate temporary suspension from the Register of pharmacists found guilty of drug abuse and/or theft (Bristol & District); to reinforce the Society's inspectorate (Brighton & District Branch); and to embark on a public relations campaign (Dudley, Stourbridge & District).

<A NAME="c"></A>
<H3><B>PSNC to appoint director</B></H3>
<P>
A director is to be appointed to the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee, following recommendations of a shake-up of the organisation by an internal working group.
<P>
It is not known how this role will differ from the old role of chief executive, which was dropped in 1988. "I think that will take time to answer," comments retiring PSNC chairman David Sharpe.
<P>
In a meeting last week, the PSNC agreed to accept all working group recommendations, including making the chairman a non-executive role and setting up an audit sub-committee to examine the performances of the chairman and vice chairman.
<P>
The thrust of the director's role will be to formulate and execute a strategy for the remuneration of contractors "that ensures market shares, profit and value are achieved, both nationally and in local health authorities".
<P>
The post will be advertised nationally and in the pharmaceutical press next month. PSNC says it expects its senior officers, secretary Stephen Axon and financial executive Godfrey Horridge, to apply for the post.
<P>
The role of the chairman has also been re-appraised as a non-executive role with no input in the day to day running of the office. He/she will lead negotiations at ministerial and senior civil servant level and will continue to be the public face of the PSNC. 
<P>
The working group felt that this revised role would require less time commitment on the part of the chairman, but decided it was outwith its remit to recommend a length of term of office for the post. However, the group did state that every member of the Committee "should be able to aspire to the chairmanship and vice chairmanship".
<P>
Steven Williams, chairman of the nine-man working group, says the move to appoint a director and the re-think of the chairman's role was prompted by Mr Sharpe's decision to retire. "It was felt appropriate that we should look at the type of chairman who is going to lead us forward to the new era."
<P>
David Plumb, working group member, adds: "If the chairman has an executive function or if the role is very demanding, the number of people who will be able to do it will be fewer."
<P>
Alan Smith, PSNC chief executive for 12 years until 1988, feels the move to appoint a director is long overdue, "it's something they should have done many years ago". He urges PSNC to appoint "a breath of fresh air, a dynamic force. I think they need an influx of new talent to the negotiating side".
<P>
The working group also concluded that the vice chairman's role would be to support the chairman and lead the negotiating team and stand in for the chairman when necessary. 
<P>
Both the chairman and vice chairman will be members of all sub-committees, except the soon to be set up audit sub-committee, which will look at "the roles, performances, targets and achievements of the chairman, vice chairman and officers".
<P>
David Sharpe says: "Costs will be higher, but the Committee accepted that because it is the best way forward for the future."

<H3><B>Masters title for four-year degree</B></H3>
<P>
Students completing the new four-year pharmacy course in England, Wales and Northern Ireland will graduate with a Masters, despite the majority of schools of pharmacy wanting retention of the BPharm title.
<P>
"It was a case where a minority decision inevitably dictated what was going to happen, because of the competitive effect on the others," explains the Royal Pharmaceutical Society's head of education, Dr Robert Dewdney. 
<P>
It was perceived that those schools of pharmacy not offering an MPharm could lose students to those who would. Dr Paul Collier, head of teaching at Queen's University, Belfast, says: "It's our desire to go for an MPharm. We went that way reluctantly, as we did not want to disadvantage our students." All schools will now have to apply to their university board to alter the title. 
<P>
However, it raises particular problems in Scotland, where the pharmacy degree course is already of four years' duration, leading to a BSc qualification.
<P>
According to Strathclyde University's head of department, Professor Roger Waigh: "There's a perception that it would not be in the best interests of Scottish graduates to have a Bachelors degree when their English counterparts have a Masters."
<P>
Both Strathclyde and Robert Gordon University are discussing the matter. However, there may a requirement to alter the current course structure and content.
<P>
There are also fears that the new title will create problems in recruiting postgraduate students for Masters degrees in pharmacy. "It's a worry that we won't be able to preserve the distinctiveness of the postgraduate degrees," says Dr Dewdney.
<P>
He adds that NHS training commissioners may be loathe to fund further postgraduate work on the grounds that pharmacists will already have a Masters.
<P>
The argument for an MPharm hinged around the fact that chemistry, physics, maths and engineering students who complete four-year degrees, outside of Scotland, are awarded an MPharm.

<H3><B>Noyce calls for PMRs to include OTC medication</B></H3>
<P>
All patients' medication, both over the counter and prescribed, should be recorded, according to Peter Noyce, professor of pharmacy practice at the University of Manchester.
<P>
Writing in last week's British Medical Journal, Professor Noyce and general practitioner Dr Huw Thomas call for pharmacists to have a direct and reliable route for reporting adverse drug reactions.
<P>
Professor Noyce highlights the need for complete records, especially with the deregulation of prescription medicines. He believes that there will be a much longer lag-time to pick up ADRs caused by POM to P switches because patients will have no one to report ADRs to in the community. He thinks PMRs will only be effective with patient-held records giving full OTC and prescribed medicine details.

<H3><B>Glaxo-Wellcome reviews agency scheme</B></H3>
<P>
Glaxo Wellcome is re-assessing its trading agreements as a result of the integration of the two companies.
<P>
GW says that the review "is part of an ongoing process to ensure that pharmacists continue to receive a high level of service consistent with the company's commitment to meet customer needs as effectively as possible".
<P>
Michael Watts, director of the British Association of Pharmaceutical Wholesalers, says that the BAPW "has been consulted and is assisting [GW] in examining what is an even more complex trading relationship".
<P>
The company says that the review is in its "early exploratory phase and, as such, [GW] has not made any decisions as to how it wishes to progress".
<P>
Glaxo introduced its agency scheme for wholesalers in 1991. Under the scheme, wholesalers receive an agency fee for distributing Glaxo products rather than operating through the traditional wholesaler route of buying and reselling products at a profit.

<H3><B>Jacob Bell - wanted dead or alive!</B></H3>
<P>
If anyone knows the whereabouts of Jacob Bell, the Chelsea Pharmacy mascot, would they please contact Dr Tony Theobald immediately!
<P>
Dr Theobald, deputy head of the pharmacy department at King's College, London, is keen to trace Jacob, a bell which was regularly tolled and paraded at exam results time between 1950 and 1970. 
<P>
But where did he come from and what happened to him? And why the urgency? Dr Theobald explains that Jacob will be central to the celebrations marking the department's centenary later this year. "I would be very happy to receive any anecdotes and information on his whereabouts. We plan to find Jacob, re-hang him in Room 18 and ring him loudly at the celebration," he says.
<P>
Failing that, the celebrations will still go ahead with a reunion conference and dinner for all past staff and students on November 2 in College House.  Details are available from Dr Theobald at King's College dep-artment of pharmacy (tel: 0171 333 4840).

<h3>LPCs set health challenge</h3>
Health authorities and the social services have been challenged to involve pharmacists more in community care.
<p>
Care for three of the most vulnerable groups the elderly, the mentally ill and substance abusers could benefit from more use of community pharmacy, says North-East London Pharmaceutical Committee's chairman Gary Boorman.
<p>
He was speaking at the second annual dinner of NELPC, held at the Royal Pharmaceutical Society last week. Among the guests were the Barking & Havering Health Authority chairman, Peter Brokenshire; chief pharmacist at the NHSE Bryan Hartley, Society Council members and senior representatives of other HAs.
<p>
Mr Boorman told guests that NELPC was "looking to develop, as partners with others, what we term integrated care with pharmacists as members of a primary care team working with social services and the health service".
<p>
Noting that community pharmacists work in a multi-disciplinary and multi-agency environment, Mr Boorman spoke of what is understood by "needs-based and continuously-evolving pharmaceutical care".
<p>
This has been defined by Council member and NELPC secretary Hemant Patel as improving access to care, provision of up to date healthy lifestyle information and responsible provision of drug therapy to improve a patient's quality of life.
<p>
Mr Boorman also proposed a forum to formulate local strategies for a multiple healthcare agency. However, he said: "What is sadly missing is the necessary means to draw up a local strategy to put theory into practice.
<p>
"We believe local pharmacists have the necessary enthusiasm, skills, local contacts, credibility and a sense of purpose and direction to take this initiative forward."
<p>
Mr Brokenshire responded by saying that his new health authority, created on April 1, will only succeed if there is an inter-relationship of the professionals.
<p>
However, he warned that "as plans exceed resources, we have to persuade contractors to change their services".
<p>
He said he was willing to feed Mr Boorman's proposals into the system and suggested that "it would be interesting to review the progress in one year's time".

<h3>Have bike, have leathers, will deliver</h3>
<P>
An advertisement for a pharmacy delivery person with "bike and leathers" provided has excited feelings in the Midlands. 
<p>
Co-op Healthcare wishes to pilot its Early Bird delivery service from its Tunstall, Stoke-on-Trent, branch for people who find it difficult to have their prescriptions dispensed due to work. But Staffordshire Local Pharmaceutical Committee secretary Gaz Clapinski has taken exception. He tells C&D that he thinks it is a backward step to highlight such a service, "particularly when we are saying to the public how vital the pharmacist's intervention is".
<p>
He thinks that wherever possible the pharmacist should make deliveries in person. He personally disapproves of vans or bikes doing such work.
<p>
"Research shows many people do not take in everything the doctor tells them when the prescription is handed over. That is why the Royal Pharmaceutical Society feels it is so important to have a point of contact with a pharmacist as a safeguard," he says.
<p>
But David Short from Co-op Healthcare says a key point is that the despatch rider would be trained up to the standard of a medicines counter assistant. The service being piloted would enable people to leave scripts with the pharmacy early in the morning on their way to work and the medicines would be delivered to their place of work by midday. The rider would have a two-way radio to deal with any queries.
<p>
Mr Short thinks that customers are not always able to leave work at lunchtime to go to a pharmacy and there are parking difficulties. The Early Bird scheme is a response to a clear need.
<p>
He says the company has written to the RPSGB with the details and would accept any guidance. If successful, the pilot could be extended. The company feels it is inappropriate for a local competitor pharmacist to comment on the situation while proposals are still being considered.

<h3>Scottish support for ADR role for hospital pharmacists</h3>
<P>
Hospital pharmacists should report all unexpected events and adverse reactions to newer drugs using the yellow card system, a Scottish Office report recommends. Pharmacists should also educate other healthcare staff on the prevention, detection and reporting of adverse reactions.
<p>
The report, published this week by the Clinical Resource and Audit Group (CRAG), gives the latest guidelines on the practice of clinical pharmacy in Scotland. It emphasises the need for pharmacists to use their time effectively and to prioritise the delivery of pharmaceutical care. It describes a structured method for individual patient care, including discharge planning, and calls for collaboration between hospital and community pharmacists.
<p>
The report, 'Clinical pharmacy in the hospital pharmaceutical service: a framework for practice', also recommends that hospital pharmacists play a part in educating patients and the public on the safe and effective use of medicines. Activities could range from talks to patient groups and schools to issuing leaflets on the safe storage, use and disposal of medicines.
<p>
Pharmacists should develop care plans to meet patients' counselling needs and identify those most likely to benefit from education, such as those with a history of non-compliance or receiving complex therapies. The patient or carer should be given written, as well as oral, information. 
<p>
CRAG also recently circulated guidelines to community pharmacists in Scotland on 'Counselling and advice on medicines and appliances in community pharmacy'. The group is chaired by the chief medical officer for Scotland and acts as a national forum for planning and assessing clinical resources and their use.

<h3>MCA investigates Internet sales</h3>
<P>

The Medicines Control Agency is investigating claims that POMs are being sold on the Internet.
<p>
A report in the Daily Telegraph last week says that a company that is based in the Turks & Caicos Islands is making 14 prescription medicines available by mail order from abroad.
<p>
An MCA spokeswoman says: "On the face of it, the sales appear to be an infringement of the Regulations. Officers are investigating." The MCA is urging the public not to purchase medicines via the Internet.

<h3>Scots get new prescription form</h3>
<P>

A revised prescription form is being introduced in Scotland from October 7.
<p>
The front of the form and the size are unchanged, but the back has been revised to take account of changes for those exempt from charges on income grounds.
<p>
As in England and Wales, all patients will need to sign the new form. Health boards have been asked to withdraw all outstanding old forms from GPs as soon as possible after October 7.
<p>
<li>A new Drug Tariff for Scotland was published on September 1, replacing the June edition.

<h3>APS aims for top spot in the UK</h3>
<P>

Leeds-based Approved Prescription Services has unveiled an ambitious launch programme that aims to introduce at least one 'blockbuster' generic worth £40 million annually.
<p>
The programme reflects APS's aim to become the UK's leading generics company now that it is part of Teva, a multinational gen-erics giant based in Israel. Teva acquired APS for £34m in July.
<p>
APS will launch various unspecified Teva products into the UK by early next year. In addition, it will launch 12 molecules next year, nine in 1998, ten in 1999 and nine again in 2000.
<p>
Last year, APS was the second biggest company in the UK, with a 21 per cent share of sales (Norton was top with 28 per cent).
<p>
Meanwhile, Teva has set up a 'skeleton' company, called Teva UK, to market its UK sales of Copaxone, a treatment for multiple sclerosis. The product, made by the company in Israel, is currently being examined by the Medicines Control Agency.
<p>
<li>Teva is believed to be close to receiving approval from the US regulatory authorities for a gen-eric version of Prozac.

<h3>New Penrith HQ for BCA</h3>

The Border Chemists Alliance looks set to open its new headquarters and depot in Penrith, where it will have 20-30, mostly part-time, staff.
<p>
"The premises have now been agreed and many of the logistical problems of computers, racking and staffing have been addressed," says Jeremy Aspden, the new wholesaler's chairman.
<p>
In addition, the company has appointed four directors to its board: Alyson Young from Carlisle, Andrew Cairns from Dumfries, Bill Darling from South Shields and Hugh Tasker from Selkirk.
<p>
The BCA wants to be a full-line pharmaceutical wholesaler for north east England, south west Scotland, Borders and Cumbria.
<p>
It says it is getting more support from independent pharmacists in Carlisle because the Lloyds Chemists' depot in the town is due to be sold.

<H1 align=center><B>1996-97 offer to NHS contractors</B></H1>


<P align=center><I>The full text of the current Department of Health offer (published on dotPHARMACY February 3)  and PSNC reaction are retained on this page for reference</I></P>
<P>
Pharmacists have been offered a &quot;derisory&quot; 2.5% on the
global sum for dispensing NHS prescriptions in 1996-97 - but other
remuneration elements would be frozen or reduced.
<P>
The Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee is rejecting
the Department of Health's offer, summarising its main proposals
as :-
<P>
<UL>
<LI>A freeze in the level of the dispensing fee
<LI>A reduction in the value of the professional allowance, both on the graduated prescription scale and above the 1,600 prescriptions threshold
<LI>No change in the level of any other fees
<LI>An increase in the amount of the global sum money devolved to local level in an effort to take account of the large number of homes already receiving advice from contractors
<LI>A refusal to consider having national fees for the services which are devolved for local management</LI>
</UL>
<P>
The full text of the DoH offer is :-
<P>
1995/96 saw the fruition of our plans to restructure fees within
the global sum. We have shifted the emphasis away from piece rate
services, and have made explicit recognition of the professional
role that pharmacists play by introducing a professional allowance.
<P>
You have suggested that productivity and efficiency are measured
largely by the volume of NHS prescriptions dispensed. I agree
that when the global sum was paid out almost entirely by way of
dispensing fee, the number of prescriptions dispensed was one
of the few measures that we had available for assessing productivity.
With the shift in emphasis mentioned above, we would expect to
consider a widening of the professional role of pharmacists as
well as increases in dispensing volume. As in recent years any
increase in pay can only be justified if there is a rise in productivity.
<P>
You have expressed the view that the current level of core gross
profit is having a de-motivating effect on contractor pharmacists.
The Department's aim is that, as a healthcare profession, community
pharmacy is properly paid for the professional services it provides;
that it is reimbursed the net acquisition cost of the medicines
dispensed, assuming a cost effective purchasing strategy; and
that the level of the global sum is set at a level that means
that expenses such as the difference in the time at which medicines
are bought and are reimbursed can be met.
<P>
I am aware, of course, that it was agreed during the 1995/96 pay
negotiations that we should look at your concerns about working
capital. We have thoroughly examined the problems you have presented
to us. Our calculations suggest that since the introduction of
the global sum the fall of interest rates has more than compensated
for the increase in the drugs bill. We believe that on the basis
of the assumptions that we normally use to calculate the time
between a pharmacist paying for stock on average, and being paid
for prescriptions dispensed the amount required for working capital
as a consequence of the payment schedule has fallen in cash terms
(let alone real terms) since 1989. We have discussed this with
 officers of the Committee, and look forward to your comments
on our analysis of the situation.
<P>
In the light of the above, Ministers have agreed that we should
make the following offer for 1996/97. The calculations are based
on the assumption of a 1 April implementation date. Should that
prove not to be achievable the actual level of the fees will be
determined by the date of the settlement:
<P>
(i) an increase to the global sum of 2.5% taking it to &#163;688.5m.
This would be the sum which would determine the application of
the trigger mechanism. This is conditional on your agreement to
the devolution of the Domicillary Oxygen Cylinder Service to local
management in 1996/97. Also, it is made on the basis that you
will accept the offer made to you previously that a fee of 40p
should be payable for each prescription for a Schedule 3 Controlled
Drug, including temazepam, from 1 April 1996 onwards.
<P>
(ii) a flat rate dispensing fee of 94.6pence. This is the same
rate as for 1995/96, and any increases in income from dispensing
will, therefore come from increases in activity. We are assuming
a national average increase in prescription volume of 3%;
<P>
(iii)  a professional allowance of &#163;735 which would be payable
each month to pharmacies which have priced 1,100 or more
prescriptions in the relevant month rising to &#163;1,290 at 1,600
prescriptions. In addition, contractors with whom an arrangement
has been made would need to continue to meet the other qualifying
conditions we have previously agreed. This is a reduction in the
level of the professional allowance which is proposed in recognition
of the fact that the threshold number of prescriptions for qualification
for payment are being held at the level of 1995/96, and that in
view of the comments in your letter, we have not sought any new
criteria for eligibility.
<P>
(iv) all other fees should remain at the 1995/96 level with any
increases in pay being consequent in activity.
<P>
You have asked me to consider having national fees for the services
which are devolved for local management. We cannot agree to this.
We wish Health Authorities to have as much freedom as possible
to manage the services locally in the best interests of their
population.
<P>
There has been a very considerable rise in the number of homes
which are receiving advice in the safe keeping and administration
of medicines. In recognition of this we would like to propose
that within the overall total of the global sum, the amount which
was devolved in 1995/96 for management of specified services at
local level should be increased by 5%, Health Authorities being
advised that we would expect the bulk of the increase to be used
for services to homes. We believe that this is broadly in line
with your request.

<H1 align=center>An introduction to the Internet</H1>
<P align=center><B>Paul Hodgkinson FIScT takes pharmacists new to surfing through its paces</B></P>

In the past few years, there has been an explosive growth in the Internet. This has been stimulated by better software and fuelled by the rapid growth of freely available information, often made more attractive by images and sound.
<P>
While public attention has been focused on the Internet, government bodies and companies have also been attracted to it and they have contributed to the quality of information available - including pharmacy material.
<P>
The Internet, or just "the net", has its origins in the late 1960s and was developed by the US military and academics. It uses a common protocol which allows many types of computer to communicate with each other using a robust system of network links. 
<P>
As its name suggests, it links a series of networks using a backbone network to provide long-distance communications. The system allows individual mach-ines to connect to the Internet via local area networks or using "dial up" over telephone lines. 
<P>
The software revolution, based on client/server services, has transformed the net by reducing network traffic and matching software to the operating system of the user's machine. This provides a standard, seamless, user-friendly interface. The best known service is the World Wide Web (WWW); its client software, or browser, handles hypertext pages, based on clickable links, and identifies the types of files selected from the server on the Internet. 
<P>
It can also automatically load files into other applications software already on the user's machine. The WWW browser has now evolved to handle almost all other Internet services: electronic mail (e-mail), news, gopher, which is a menu-driven information service, and file transfer.
<P>
Information on the net is stored as files. Understanding the way files are stored and located embraces three concepts, machine identification, directory structure and file type. 

<H4>Machine identification</H4>

Each machine (usually a computer) which connects directly to the net has a unique Internet protocol (IP) number allocated to it. A typical IP number is: 146.227.70.60
<P>
It is structured like a telephone number. The numbers to the right (60) are the machine number, the other numbers indicate the networks leading to the machine, with the highest level (similar to the international dialling code) to the far left. 
<P>
Where a computer has a constant connection, and therefore number, it is usually allocated a name, which is structured in the reverse order to the numbers, for example: janus.dmu.ac.uk
<P>
In this case, janus is the machine name and the unique country code, uk, is to the right. Computers that connect temporarily using a telephone line and modem are often allocated a number dynamically each time.

<H4>Directories and files</H4>
The principle of organising files in directories applies to all operating systems. The simplest example of information stored and transmitted as files is e-mail. To associate e-mail with individual users an account name, or alias, is added to the address. A typical e-mail address is: phh@dmu.ac.uk
<P>
In this case, phh is the username. The machine name has been dropped, because it is usual to have e-mail delivered to a central mail server, which then forwards the e-mail to the appropriate computer.
<P>
Other files on the Internet are usually identified using a uniform resource locator (URL), which indicates the type of Internet service, the machine and the directory path to the file. The file extension usually conforms to a standard that identifies the type of file, for example, images, sound or text. A typical URL is: <P align=center>http://www.dmu.ac.uk/dept/schools/appsci/pharm/pme/phh .gif</P>
<P>
From left to right:
<UL>
<LI>http indicates a World Wide Web server
<LI>// the file is on the Internet (/// would mean the file is on the user's local disk)
<LI>www.dmu.ac.uk identifies the machine 
<LI>dept/schools/appsci/pharm/pme is the path, or directories, to the file
<LI>phh.gif is the file itself, gif is the file extension and indicates that it is an image.
</UL>
<P>
In some cases, where the URL provides the initial point of contact, it is made simpler by dropping the path and file name. The URL for Chemist &amp; Druggist's home page on the World Wide Web, for example, is: http://www.dotpharmacy.com/
<P>
Problems with interpretation of URL's arise because UNIX, the Internet operating system, is case sensitive, therefore paul.gif is not the same file as Paul.gif. 
<P>
To access the net, a suitable computer with appropriate software is required. 

<H4>The hardware</H4>

Most personal computers can be used to connect to the Internet. However, the modern trend is to deliver the information as multi-media files and the computer may need to be able to process these. At the other extreme, e-mail can be read using the most basic computer. The specification, and therefore the cost, is determined by the intended use. 

<H4>The connection</H4>

In larger organisations, machines are connected together to form local networks, but for most smaller pharmacies, a modem, which converts digital signals for transmission over a conventional telephone line, is required. 
<P>
The minimum modem speed should be 14.4Kbps, although 28.8Kbps is the ideal. The most common instruction set for modems is Hayes, this defines the modem commands, rather like DOS for PCs. All modems connected directly to BT lines must carry the green BABT-approved label. A reasonable one is about £200. 

<H4>The service provider</H4>

The modem is used to connect to an Internet service provider (ISP), which provides access, or a point of presence (POP), to the net. Services fall into two categories. Gateway services use terminal emulation to connect to the host computer on the Internet. In this case, the user"s machine is not directly connected to the net imposing severe constraints, since the user interface is based around the host machine's operating system. 
<P>
The second type, referred to as an Internet protocol service, allocates an IP number to the user's machine during connection, which is the key to full connectivity. The ideal ISP should offer a local POP with the capacity to provide reliable connection at 28.8Kbps during cheap rate periods, and an IP service. Typically this will cost  £15 per month.

<H4>The software</H4>

The software required will depend to some extent on the facilities provided by the service provider and the intended use. IP services require software that runs in the background. Once this is installed, configured and a successful connection is made, most of the Internet user software can be set up easily. The ISP often provides software. 
<P>
The ultimate connection solution is to purchase an "Internet-ready" machine. These come with the hardware and software installed and a subscription to a service provider. All that is required is to fill in a few personal details during the initial connection process.
<P>
<H4>Using the Internet</H4>

There are numerous magazines available that provide well presented and easy to understand literature with cover disks or CDs. The general PC magazines frequently have offers of free trial subscriptions to service providers, they usually include a free disk or CD-ROM with all the necessary software and tutorials. 
<P>
Another method of gaining hands-on experience without capital outlay is to frequent the Cyber Cafes. These are coffee shops which have computers connected to the net with online time sold by the hour. They can be found in most major cities - pubs are now following this lead. Universities also offer courses, although these can be expensive.
<P>
While the first connection is greeted with euphoria, the arrival of a telephone bill provides a sobering influence. The answer is to transfer the file to the user"s hard disk, rather than reading it while still connected.
<P>
Once information has been located on the net, rapid movement between the appropriate pages to cache to the local disk, combined with offline reading, returning online only to follow new links, will reduce costs. Bookmark facilities can usually be used to store details of URL's of interest recalled offline from the cache. 
<P>
The ability of Internet browsers, such as WWW's Netscape, to retrieve from local drives has led to a trend towards providing initial WWW pages on CD-ROM. 
<P>
Electronic mail should be handled in a similar manner. New mail should be transferred to the user's machine and then read offline. Mail and replies should also be prepared offline and then transferred as files for dispatch. The most common process used is Post Office Protocol (POP3). This mechanism can also be extended to public discussion forums.
<P>
Because of its novel nature, the Internet supplements, rather than competes with, other established forms of communication. Pharmacy in the UK has a history of involvement in this technology with facilities like PINS, which was run by the Royal Pharmaceutical Society until 1991, and this stimulated interest.

<h3>Unease over new script software</h3>
A new computer system being promoted to GPs looks set to cause a stir. Called Scrip Manager, it offers doctors the facility to automatically generate repeat prescriptions and 'post' them electronically to pharmacies subscribing to the system.
<p>
It comes from High Wycombe-based Practice Resource Systems, chaired by pharmacist Maurice Leaman, and is also being marketed by VAMP representatives (VAMP is a GP practice system used by around 2,000 surgeries). 
<p>
GP practices joining the scheme are being offered a Pentium PC, a communications package and Scrip Manager software at no cost. Pharmacies will have to pay for access to Healthlink, the electronic mailbox which will 'collect' repeat prescriptions from surgeries. 
<p>
Mr Leaman says the company has not yet determined how the system will be charged for, as it is still being tested. Scrip Manager is currently being trialled in at least two independent pharmacies.
<p>
Boots the Chemists has firmly denied rumours that it is buying the package. Company spokeswoman Sharon Buckle says: "Boots has not bought into this system. We are aware of its existence. However, there is a number of issues which this initiative raises and these require further consideration."
<p>
The system was presented to the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee on Tuesday. Secretary Steve Axon says: "PSNC is very concerned about certain aspects of the proposals, especially the differential treatment of pharmacists and GPs, and the considerable cost to pharmacies.
<p>
"The general philosophy be-hind the arrangement also was a matter of concern to the Committee, which has asked for further detailed information."
<p>
A presentation to the National Pharmaceutical Association is also planned before the system is officially launched to pharmacists in the next fortnight.
<p>
Concerns have been raised that it will infringe the Royal Pharmaceutical Society's guidance on the direction of prescriptions, and cut non-participating pharmacies out of the running for repeat scripts. 
<p>
There are also fears that, if taken up by large groups, it will open the way to closed-door 'prescription factory' pharmacies, and possibly direct home delivery of prescription items.
<p>
Mr Leaman insists these fears are misplaced. "Clearly, as a pharmacist, I would not go down a road which ends in breaking the Code of Ethics."
<p>
A spokeswoman from the RPSGB's law department says the Society will not obstruct progress, but technological developments cannot be allowed to override patient choice.
<p>
"Any link-up between surgeries and pharmacies would have to comply with the Code of Ethics generally," she says.
<p>
Specifically, the operators would have to ensure that:
<br>
<li> patients continue to be offered the same choice (of pharmacies) to get their prescriptions dispensed as before
<li> there was no restriction or direction of prescriptions
<li> any pharmacy would be able to participate in the system on an equal footing to others.
<p>
Scrip Manager enables GPs to store data about pharmacy services for both practice and patient use. It also offers a 24-hour Freefone advice line linking patients to pharmacists with the system. Drug information pharmacists are also available 24 hours a day to advise doctors.
<p>
Repeat script requests are generated automatically when they are due, which PRS claims saves practice staff searching records. All that day's repeat items can be printed out together.
<p>
Scripts for a particular pharmacy are labelled for easy collation, ready for collection. All scripts are bar coded for identification, and encrypted to ensure patient confidentiality is maintained during data transfer to the receiving pharmacy.
<p>
The software flags any unusual dosage regimens or potential interactions and can provide the practice with prescribing data by therapeutic and disease area.
<p>
Coventry GP Dr George Paige, who has been approached by PRS about the system, says it "sounded as if it could be expensive in PACT terms as not all patients need repeat prescriptions".
<p>
He was also concerned about the impact it might have on local pharmacies which do not choose to use Scrip Manager if it is taken up widely elsewhere.
<p>
Mr Leaman says it offers pharmacists many opportunities. "It will mean that pharmacists are no longer an electronic island. It means they can be a fuller part of the primary care team."

<h3>Patience required for patient packs</h3>

Health minister Gerald Malone has advised pharmaceutical manufacturers that the dispensing and reimbursement arrangements that will make the industry's patient pack initiative effective for patients cannot be phased in until February or March next year.
<p>
In a letter to the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, Mr Malone re-affirmed the Government's commitment to patient packs, acknowledging that they were key to the delivery of information to patients as required by EC directives.
<p>
Officials will be in touch with professional groups to brief them on what lies ahead, the minister said.
<p>
This was welcome news to the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee. Secretary Steve Axon knew nothing of the minister's proposals on Tuesday. PSNC wrote to all those concerned only a short while ago, expressing its worry over the lack of progress.
<p>
Welcoming the minister's statement, the ABPI's commercial affairs director, Frances Charlsworth, says: "The industry has been producing medicines in accordance with the original phasing of the patient pack programme since the beginning of the year.
<p>
"But there is no doubt that the problems over introducing the necessary administrative procedures are continuing to cause delays in these packs reaching the patient."

<h3>CPG launches Gatekeeper initiative</h3>

The Community Pharmacists' Group has launched a new initiative, called 'Pharmacy a New Gatekeeper to Healthcare'.
<p>
It aims to advance some of the principles within the 'Pharmacy in a New Age' initiative and "to define and substantiate" what can be done to promote the message to the public.
<p>
The initiative was launched at the Conference the day after the 'New Horizons' document was presented to delegates. 
<p>
"We want to contribute to PIANA," said CPG committee member Mark Koziol. "The CPG is going to choose a bite-sized chunk. We want to show the whole rainbow effects of services, so that everyone can practise pharmacy with dignity."
<p>
The initiative's slogan was chosen carefully, he said. 'Pharmacy' represents the premises and the profession, yet also incorporates those pharmacists who work in the community, but not from a pharmacy.
<p>
'Gatekeeper to Healthcare' would recognise that pharmacists have acted for some time in that capacity like GPs and community nurses but have often gone unrewarded.
<p>
The reason for the term 'New' is that the role has lacked definition. "We need to substantiate and prove our claims," said Mr Koziol. "We need to show we have a business case for community pharmacy."
<p>
The aim of the four-phase plan is "for pharmacy to carve itself a 'legitimate' niche", so that its message "can progress to the higher echelons of Government".
<p>
The first phase involves a questionnaire to provide information, such as how time is spent in community pharmacy. The CPG hopes to define all the roles that are currently provided within community pharmacy from this.
<p>
It then aims to generate more awareness among the public, before taking it to other healthcare professionals and ultimately to Government paymasters.
<p>
Some members of the audience thought 'gateway' would be a better term as it was 'inclusive'. 'Gatekeeper' suggested exclusion of access. Mr Koziol said that the 'gateway' term had been considered, but the committee had decided on 'Gatekeeper'.
<p>
Another criticism was that there was no empowerment in the slogan for the public to look after its health.
<p>
RPSGB deputy secretary Philip Green, who presented the 'New Horizons' initiative, thought that it would be possible for the CPG and Society initiatives to "live together".
<p>
Former Society president Ann Lewis believed that it was no longer possible to 'pigeon-hole' people into categories as there were "fuzzy" or "leaky" boundaries between the different sections within pharmacy.
<p>
The launch pack suggests traditional and additional 'Gatekeeper' roles. Among the traditional areas are ensuring patients know how to use their medicines and making active use of patient medication records. 
<p>
Additional roles include active involvement in compliance issues and co-ordinated health education campaigns.

<h3>Needle exchange threatened</h3>

Aberdeen pharmacists have told Grampian Health Board that they will withdraw from a needle exchange scheme on September 30 unless more money is found.
<P>
They say that the soaring drugs problem and rise in the numbers of scheme users is affecting their businesses due to shoplifting and customer intimidation.
<P>
Three of the eight shops operating the scheme each see 1,500 needles exchanged per week. Pharmacies receive a payment of £2 per day for participating. 
<P>
"We are not looking to make a profit, just to break even. We are trying to recompense our losses," says Garry McDonald of Moss Chemists, which collects four dust bin-sized sharps containers of needles each week.
<P>
"We appreciate that the Health Board's hands are tied because money comes from the Scottish Office," he says and adds that the HB has been sympathetic. It has offered £650 to each pharmacy, but this was rejected on the grounds that it was a one-off payment.
<P>
"We are looking for a tiered structure or a per capita fee, but the Health Board is not interested in this because its finance is tied," says Mr McDonald. He believes the situation will not improve when local negotiations start next year.
<P>
A spokesman for Grampian HB says that it is continuing negotiations and hopes to come to a satisfactory agreement.

<h3>Lothain Health education scheme rolls into third year</h3>

The community pharmacist training programme, run by the pharmacist facilitators for Lothian Health, has just complete its second year.
<p>
A further eight pharmacists have joined the eight from last year's programme in obtaining accreditation to Primary Care, Lothian Health, for providing prescribing advice services to two of their local practices.
<p>
Each pharmacist made six GP practice visits during a nine-month period and a payment of £50 was made for each visit. Topics discussed at the meetings included H pylori eradication therapy, modified-release preparations and NSAIDs, and the management of gastric side-effects.
<p>
The aims of the training programme are:
<br>
<li>to increase the provision of independent drug information to GPs
<li>to improve liaison between GPs and community pharmacists
<li>to develop the role of pharmacists in the primary care team.

<p>
An evaluation of the training programme shows that 82 per cent of GPs want the pharmacist visits to continue. General drug information and information on new drugs were identified by doctors as being more useful than formulary development and SPA analysis.
<p>
Lothian Health has agreed to fund the training programme for a third year and a further five community pharmacists are about to embark on the training.

<h3>Unichem growing stronger</h3>

Unichem has underlined the strength in both its retail and wholesale divisions, with overall pre-tax profits up 11.5 per cent to £24.158 million on a turnover of £718.555m for the six months to June. 
<p>
The pre-tax profit results include the net cost of funding the company's 9.9 per cent stake in Lloyds Chemists (it paid £67.7m for it).
<p>
Unichem's gearing shot up to 52 per cent at the end of June because of the stake in Lloyds and associated bid expenses. But it maintains that its cash flow is strong, with its operations delivering a cash inflow of £28.173m, up more than £15m on the same period last year.
<p>
It spent £12m cash on buying fixed assets and retail pharmacies and says that, excluding the stake in Lloyds, its net borrowings would have been low and its gearing would have been 4 per cent.
<p>
Jeff Harris, chief executive of Unichem, says the future looks promising. "Overall the business is performing well, and this validates our confidence in our growth strategy, for which the acquisition of Lloyds would be an acceleration rather than a diversification," he says. (Unichem and Gehe have already submitted their list of buyers to the Department of Trade and Industry.)
<p>
The firm's wholesale division increased its operating profits by 13.2 per cent to £19.403m, compared with the same period last year. This reflected the efficiency gains that came from the warehouse restructuring programme, which was completed last year.
<p>
The division's turnover rose 2.1 per cent to £645.677m; and like for like sales of prescription pharmaceuticals rose 4 per cent. Unichem says the relatively lacklustre growth reflects the business it lost when its centralised OTC depot, set-up last year, developed operational difficulties.
<p>
However, the company says the wholesale division has overcome these difficulties and has begun a number of marketing schemes to win back business. Like for like sales towards the end of the first half were said to be strong.
<p>
Its wholesale trading margins are said to have grown in the first half, despite cut-price competition from other wholesalers. Unichem expects the margins to continue to grow into the third quarter.
<p>
A number of new schemes for pharmacists are expected to be launched over the next 12 months.
<p>
Meanwhile, Unidrug Distribution Group, the pre-wholesale joint venture between Unichem and United Drug, has signed a deal to handle all of Bristol-Myers Squibb's UK and Irish medical business starting in December. 
<p>
Unichem has appointed Dr Jim Stewart, formerly managing director of Ciba Pharmaceuticals, as non-executive chairman of UDG. Dr Stewart will take his post at the beginning of next month.
<p>
On the retail side, Moss Chemists has performed impressively, with its turnover up 25.3 per cent to £117.855m, and operating profit up 33.6 per cent to £6.9m. Its operating margin rose 0.37 percentage points  to 5.9 per cent, compared with the same period last year.
<p>
Moss' like for like sales of prescription pharmaceuticals grew 7.4 per cent. The chain says the market for these products has been erratic over the period, with the growth of monthly sales ranging from 15 per cent to 1 per cent. The slump was caused by the fall-off in prescription numbers at the end of the Government's fiscal year. Moss says sales of prescription pharmaceuticals have grown an average 7 per cent during six months and are expected to maintain that rate in the third quarter. 
<p>
The chain's sales of OTC products also rose 7 per cent.
<p>
Moss has acquired or agreed to acquire another 40 pharmacies, which should bring its total strength to 461 stores.
<p>
Besides established pharmaceutical lines, Moss is also moving into a limited range of quality prescription spectacles at relatively discount prices. Having completed a trial period for the spectacles, the chain is introducing them to about 400 stores.
<p>
It is also paying more attention to staff training and, consequently, has appointed Caryl Webb to the newly-created post of director of training. Ms Webb was previously Moss' director of operations.
<p>
Unichem's Portuguese wholesale division saw its turnover rise 10.4 per cent to £44.311m, while its operating profits grew 28 per cent to £1.1m.

<h3>Boots leads profit margin league table</h3>

Boots the Chemists has by far the highest pre-tax profit margins of all major pharmacy chains, according to 'Business Ratio Plus Retail & Wholesale Chemists', a report by business researcher ICC Business Publications.
<p>
During the year to July, 1995, Boots' pre-tax profit margin was 8.5 per cent, more than twice that of its nearest rival, Unichem. The gap between Boots' margin and Unichem's was as wide during the previous two financial years.
<p>
In contrast, Lloyds Retail Chemists' pre-tax profit margin of 13.1 per cent placed it top of the major chains in the year to July, 1994, but the company slipped to seventh with 2.5 per cent a year later. That of Lloyds Chemists fell from 6.2 per cent to 3.9 per cent during the same periods.
<p>
However, A Miller, a Midlothian-based subsidiary of Lloyds Chemists, had the highest pre-tax profit margins of all pharmacies, with 9.7 per cent for the year to July, 1995. It was followed closely by T S McNee, based in West Lothian, with 9.1 per cent. Boots was third.
<p>
Out of the UK's top 54 pharmacies, Green Pharmacies had the lowest pre-tax profit margins with -14 per cent (the chain had a pre-tax profit loss of £577,000 on a turnover of £4.136 million for the year to July, 1995).
<p>
ICC says the average pre-tax profit margin was 3.7 per cent for the year to July, 1995. The figure is based on the margins of 54 leading pharmacies listed in its league table.
<p>
The average profitability of pharmacies is falling due to increased competition from supermarkets and out of town stores, it adds.
<p>
Meanwhile, Lloyds Pharmaceuticals had the highest profit margins 57.9 per cent out of 66 top pharmaceutical wholesalers and suppliers for the year to July, 1995. The company, a subsidiary of Reckitt & Colman, was three times as 'profitable' as its nearest rival, Oldham-based Seton Products.

<H1 align=center>Net gains on the Superhighway</H1>
<P align=center><B>In his second article Paul Hodgkinson FIScT points out some of the attractions for pharmacists</B>
<P>
The rapid expansion of the Internet over the last few years has attracted a large number of new users and contributors. There are now many services that are relevant to pharmacy and its related disciplines. In addition, it offers access to a wide range of interests, including travel, recreation and sport, that provides a "value added" aspect for professional users.
<P>
This article covers the two main facilities on the Internet at the moment, electronic mail (E-mail) and the World Wide Web (WWW). It focuses on UK-based services that provide initial contacts, or links, to other pharmacy-related resources around the world and gives examples of the contributors and topics covered. 
<P>
<H4>Electronic mail</H4>
E-mail is a basic facility offered by all networks that participate in the Internet. It involves the transfer of text in an electronic form between accounts on different computers. Apart from personal communications, commands can be sent to software providing automated facilities that will process the commands and respond using E-mail.  Another feature is the ability to copy "electronic text" and redistribute it over a wide area.
<P>
Electronic mail consists of a header that contains the sender and recipient's E-mail address, a subject line and other information, such as the date. This is followed by the contents, or text field, entered by the sender. Most E-mail messages consist of  ASCII text, a basic form that is recognised by almost all computer systems. E-mail software has the facility to transfer word processor documents using an encoding technique that converts the binary element to ASCII text. The use of this is dependent on the recipient having software capable of reading the document once it is decoded. As a result, ASCII text remains the primary standard.
<P>
<H4>Use and etiquette</H4>
To use E-mail effectively it is necessary to understand some of the unique aspects of the technology and, like all forms of communication, there is an etiquette that should be observed.
<P>
E-mail messages should be kept brief, few people read more than a screen or two. White space, that is lines between paragraphs, are particularly important, breaking up text into logical sections, making "on-screen" reading easier. Lines of text should not exceed 70 characters because some E-mail readers force a line wrap at this point, converting a single line into one long and one short line of a few characters. Capital letters throughout should not be used, this is the equivalent of SHOUTING, sometimes referred to as "flaming". Personal details should be appended to the bottom of the text field as a "signature" and contain the sender's name and address. Most E-mail software can be configured to add a "signature file" automatically.
<P>
Consider contents carefully,  while E-mail is an informal vehicle it can easily be archived and reproduced again at a later date. Do not reply to E-mail in anger, if  the contents are annoying, allow a "cooling off" period. One problem with informal use of the written word is that messages are often generated quickly by the originator and there is no associated body language to indicate the spirit in which the message was sent. To counteract this, combinations of symbols, referred to as "smiley faces" are used. For example, turn this page clockwise through 90 degrees now :-)
<P>
The combination of the colon, dash and bracket, which appear as a smile, indicate that the message is not intended to be hostile.
<P>
<H4>Distribution lists</H4>
Ease of copying allows E-mail to be distributed among groups of people with a common interest. Participating in an electronic forum involves "subscribing", which adds an E-mail address to the list of addresses for distribution. There are two E-mail addresses involved in the distribution list mechanism. One is for administration, usually via an automated process, and the second is the distribution address that processes and forwards the E-mail messages to subscribers. 
<P>
The syntax used to subscribe varies, a guideline is that the administration address should not reflect the subject of the list unless it has the word "-request" appended. Therefore, examples of a valid address for subscription would be:
<P>
listserv@machine.site.network
<P>
majordomo@machine.site.network
<P>
maiser@machine.site.network
<P>
or listname-request@machine.site.network
<P>
To obtain the exact syntax for subscription and a list of other commands send the word "help" as the first word on the first line of text to the administrative address.
<P>
An example of an E-mail distribution system for pharmacists is Pharmacy Mail Exchange at De Montfort University. This list is a general discussion forum. In addition, many new Internet services are advertised. For more details send a one-line message:
<P>
info
<P>
 to <A HREF="mailto:pharm-request@dmu.ac.uk">pharm-request@dmu.ac.uk</A>
<P>
<H4>In public</H4>
The best known public discussion forum is USENET, sometimes referred to as "The News". There are several thousand news groups covering many subjects, which are taken by many computer sites. Pharmacists are represented by the news group  sci.med.pharmacy. The News is  read independently of E-mail using a separate News Reader that also handles subscriptions. This avoids high volume in personal mailboxes and any subsequent duplication on the systems themselves. 
<P>
The principle is similar to E-mail with replies either being directed to the originator or back to the news group. In common with the traditions of The News, sci.med.pharmacy is unmoderated and provides an interesting, but sometimes volatile, environment, with contributions from pharmacists and patients around the world. 
<P>
Careful consideration should be given to the contents of postings for distribution, which may  be seen by many thousands of people. Before posting queries, check to see if the subject has been covered recently. In some cases, list owners or news groups issue an FAQ, or frequently asked questions, to cover topics, or threads (questions and replies) that occur frequently. Failure to check FAQs and, in some cases, conventional sources of information first can lead to rebuke from other subscribers.
<P>
<H4>Worldwide</H4>
The World Wide Web provides access to a wide range of resources via a hypertext interface. Its ability to incorporate images, sound and movie clips have been responsible for the increased interest in the Internet in the last few years. The most comprehensive list of pharmacy-related resources is maintained on PharmWeb at Manchester University. The URL is: http:/www.mcc.ac.uk/pharmweb/
<P>
<H4>Locating information</H4>
There are now a variety of general search engines on the Internet, many of which can be accessed via WWW. A search engine consists of two parts: the first is a gatherer that looks around the Internet and builds a list of URLs and associated keywords into a database. There is also a broker that provides a search interface for the user. 
<P>
CyberRx is a search engine that specifically targets pharmacy-related resources, the URL is:<A HREF="http://www.dmu.ac.uk/ln/CyberRx">http://www.dmu.ac.uk/ln/CyberRx</A>
<P>
Probably the most comprehensive general search facility available is accessible at the BBC, URL: <A HREF="http://www.bbcnc.org.uk/babbage/iap.html">http://www.bbcnc.org.uk/babbage/iap.html</A>
<P>
This BBC WWW page provides links to a variety of search engines listed by category, including information, software and people.
<P>
<H4>Search strategy</H4>
<P>
The first step is to select a search engine that is appropriate to the subject area and look at any help files available that relate to the search mechanism. The principle is based on the use of operators such as AND and NOT. 
<P>
Secondly, devise a search strategy that will recover hits from the database and then refine it by restricting or broadening the search. If the search engine is case-sensitive, omitting the first letter will avoid a second pass. For example, "harmacology" will hit the words Pharmacology and pharmacology. Search strategies are usually based on the following:
<UL>
 <LI>Word relationships: Words that occur in close proximity, eg "party" and "beer"
 <LI>Adjacency: Words that occur next to each other, eg "widow" and "black"
<LI> Associations: Apply the criteria AND, eg dinghy AND boats
<LI> Negations: Apply the criteria NOT, eg father NOT Christmas
<LI> Truncation: Apply a "wild card", eg pharm* will find pharmacy and pharmacology
<LI> Intermediate words: An example is a middle name to restrict hits.
</UL>
Do not persist with a strategy that is not working. For example, if an author's name is spelt incorrectly, particularly within the first few characters, the search will fail. A subject-based search may produce a hit from which it is possible to extract the author's correct name or obtain further search categories.
<P>
<H4>Software archives</H4>
There are various software archives on the Internet, many of which can be accessed via the World Wide Web. Software is compressed and bundled into a single file which can still be comparatively large and costly to transfer using a modem. They are primarily public domain and shareware packages. 
<P>
Demonstration copies of commercial software may also be found, but these are generally "crippled" so that essential features, such as printing or file saving, do not work. The major advantage offered by the Internet software archives is the ability to access updates, and to maintain existing software, particularly at system level. 
<P>
The Pharmacy Consortium for Aided Learning provides a valuable source of information about pharmacy-related software in the UK on: <A HREF="http://www.bath.ac.uk/PCCAL/">http://www.bath.ac.uk/PCCAL/</A>
<P>
The Virtual Software Library (VSL) provides a good general starting point and access to public domain and shareware packages. The main site is at: <A HREF="http://vsl.cnet.com/desks.html">http://vsl.cnet.com/desks.html</A>
<P>
This has a list of European mirror sites. Although Imperial College in London is the designated UK site, it is heavily used and the VSL "front desks" at Ljubljana in Slovenia and Vaasa in Finland can often offer a faster means of access.
<P>
Because of the impact of the Internet, many more of today's users will go on to contribute to the growing pool of information available. The merging of digital communications technologies, such as computer, telephone and video conferencing, suggests that the future for the Internet as a vehicle for the dissemination of information is assured. Pharmacists in the UK are already well represented.

<h3>Debating the system for reporting ADRs</h3></CENTER>
<p><br><CENTER>

<STRONG>Should there be an adverse drug reaction reporting system for OTC medicines through community pharmacies? This question was put to an expert panel at a Chemex forum organised jointly by C&D and Roche Consumer Health</STRONG></CENTER>

<H4>Members of the panel</H4>
<STRONG>Sheila Kelly</STRONG> director, Proprietary Association of Great Britain; <STRONG>Roger Odd</STRONG> head of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society's practice division; <STRONG>Claire Anderson</STRONG> lecturer in community pharmacy, King's College, London; and <STRONG>Larry Goodyear</STRONG> lecturer in clinical pharmacy, King's College.

<P >
The Medicines Control Agency has agreed in principle to extend the official adverse drug reaction (ADR) reporting system to pharmacists and the Royal Pharmaceutical Society is looking into the feasibility of a national scheme for hospital pharmacists. 
<P>
Chairman Patrick Grice said that, as far as he was aware, there was no system for community pharmacists to report reactions to over the counter medicines and it would be a world first for the UK if pharmacists became involved. 
<P>
Sheila Kelly maintained that the UK already had a system for reporting reactions to OTC medicines, but it did not differentiate between these and prescription medicines. If customers experienced a severe reaction to an OTC product, they could complain to the company or could go to a GP for medical advice. In either case, the company or doctor was obliged to report the incident to the MCA. 
<P>
She thought that there would be fewer reactions to OTC products as safety was a major factor in deciding whether medicines should be available without prescription.
<P>
Roger Odd argued that, although a system was in place, the reports still had to go through a doctor. ''In many cases, the doctor might not even be aware that the patient had taken a non-prescription medicine,'' he said. ''Why shouldn't a pharmacist - with all his experience of knowing how drugs work, plus the fact that people buy non-prescription medicines from pharmacies - be in as good a position as any other professional in the healthcare team to report reactions directly to the MCA and ultimately to the companies themselves?''
<P>
Such a system was long overdue, he said. Any system would have to be acceptable to the MCA and the industry, and pharmacists would need to be trained what to report and how to report it. But to stop pharmacists being involved would not be in the public interest, particularly as more potent medicines were becoming widely available.
<P>
The Society had put forward a case to the MCA for community pharmacists to be involved in reporting adverse reactions to both prescription and non-prescription medicines, he explained. The MCA was soon expected to circulate a consultative paper to all interested parties - pharmacists, the industry and the medical profession - suggesting possible schemes. 
<P>
One option might be for pharmacists to fill in the existing yellow cards. The Society was insisting on links with prescribers, so pharmacists would know about the patient's condition and what other medicines were being taken.
<P>
Initial discussions with the British Medical Association suggested that doctors would be happy with pharmacists reporting ADRs, providing they were involved in the consultation process and received copies of reports sent to the MCA. The Society would like to see schemes in place as soon as possible after the consultations, but it could take some time to agree the guidelines within which pharmacists should operate, and to train them to report the right information. Hospital pharmacists were already being trained for this function.
<P>
Larry Goodyear, who has been looking at the feasibility of running clinical trials through community pharmacies, said that most safety data on OTC medicines came from trials in which the medicines were prescribed by GPs - a totally different population from that buying treatments from pharmacies. Sometimes OTC products were used for different indications and at different doses. 
<P>
He agreed that pharmacists were ideally placed to collect that type of data. But he wondered whether the average community pharmacist had the breadth of clinical knowledge or enough supporting information about patients. In hospitals, pharmacists would have access to the patient's notes.
<P>
Claire Anderson believed many pharmacists had enough clinical knowledge, while others would need bringing up to the right level. Some were not sufficiently involved in selling OTC medicines in their pharmacies. Hopefully, pharmacy training in schools would prepare graduates for this task.
<P>
Ms Kelly pointed out that for many POM to P switches, the indications were the same as when the product was on prescription. For others, such as ibuprofen, the prescription version had been taken day in day out for several years, possibly at high doses. In general, people now buying these medicines were younger, healthier and perhaps using the products intermittently, so the safety profile was likely to be better. 
<P>
The MCA was reluctant to switch medicines until it was confident there would be no problems with unsupervised use in the general population. Most people believed that the ADR profile of a molecule was established within three years of marketing and that a medicine could not become available off prescription until it had been on the market for at least five years.
<P>
She went on to say that most OTC purchases were repeats - about 86 per cent of people bought a medicine they had used before, so one could assume that if it caused problems, they would not still be using it. She saw pharmacists playing a valuable role in advising on medicines which patients were using for the first time and asking on a later occasion if the medicine had been suitable. ''That would give valuable feedback between the customer and the pharmacist,'' she said. She agreed that pharmacists should be involved in ADR collection and thought that there was no case for separate schemes for OTC and prescription medicines.
<P>
When asked how easy it would be in practice to identify ADRs, Mr Goodyear said it would depend on the pharmacist's clinical knowledge and the severity of the reaction. If people were not particularly worried about a reaction, they would keep it to themselves. Pharmacists tended to have a core of clients who used the pharmacy regularly and whose medical background was well known.
<P>
''In some cases, the pharmacist might be better placed to report ADRs than the GP, who might not have the same insight, as he does not see the patient as regularly,'' he said.
<P>
His experience of hospital practice was that pharmacists could refer to the patient's notes and encourage ADR reporting by filling in forms which were then signed by the registrar. He envisaged a similar system in the community, where the pharmacist identified the problem but collaborated with the GP in reporting. If the pharmacist just said to the GP, ''I think that there's an ADR'', the problem might not get reported.
<P>
Mr Odd agreed it was easier for hospital pharmacists to establish links with prescribers and obtain patient profiles. The Society was discussing with the MCA ways in which such a system could be achieved in the community. Ms Anderson thought there might be some initial problems persuading doctors to release information, because of patient confidentiality. 
<P>
When asked if PAGB member companies would be comfortable with an ADR reporting system involving OTC medicines, Ms Kelly said she did not think there would be any objections. Companies would want to know if their products were not suiting people, she said: ''It would all add to the safety net that we're trying to achieve.''

<H3><B>White paper to deliver the future?</B></H3>
<P>

The Government intends to review medicines prescribing and supply, with the aim of giving pharmacists and other health professionals wider roles. A White Paper, published on Tuesday, also promises talks on how pharmacists' remuneration can best fit future needs.
<P>
The White Paper, 'Delivering the future' (HMSO, £8.65), sets out 70 proposals to improve patient care and complements the NHS (Primary Care) Bill currently going through parliament. The Government is making available a further £100 million to develop community and primary care services.
<P>
One of the White Paper's aims is to make better use of professional skills. A working party will review, over 12 months, the prescribing and supply of medicines to determine the circumstances in which health professionals could take on new roles. 
<P>
The Government proposes to discuss with pharmacists' representatives the role of community pharmacists in helping patients get best use from their medicines. Extracts from the White Paper appear in Chemist &amp; Druggist magazine this week.

<H3><B>PIANA sees launch of audit package</B></H3>
<P>

The Royal Pharmaceutical Society has launched a resource pack to encourage community pharmacists to take part in multiprofessional clinical audit. 
<P>
The pack, which forms part of the 'Pharmacy in a New Age' agenda, contains two booklets:  'Guidance on involving the community pharmacist in multiprofessional audit' and 'Examples of multiprofessional audit'.
<P>
The pack is intended for local policymakers. It will be distributed to HA chief executives, pharmaceutical advisers, directors of public health, LPCs and the Society's branch secretaries.

<H3><B>Patients give pharmacy thumbs up</B></H3>
<P>

Almost all of the respondents in a local health council survey are satisfied or very satisfied with the service they receive from their pharmacy. Of 368 respondents in a Forth Valley LHC survey published last week, 48 per cent said they were very satisfied and 50.2 per cent were satisfied.
<P>
Other findings include: 
<li>over 69 per cent of respondents visited a pharmacy more than five times in the past year
<li>almost two-thirds used only one pharmacy for all or almost all of their scripts
<li>only 30 per cent indicated that  they would know how to get 'urgent' scripts dispensed when pharmacies are normally closed
<li>97.2 per cent thought a prescription delivery service should be provided for the housebound, the elderly or very ill
<li>only a third indicated that discussions in the pharmacy about their prescriptions were carried out in sufficient privacy
<li>subject to confidentiality, 88 per cent of patients were happy for prescription records to be held in the pharmacy
<li>almost half of respondents were unaware of the system of prepayment certificates for prescription charges.

Dexxon, an Israeli pharmaceutical company, has set up a UK subsidiary, called Dexcel-Pharma in Daventry, Northamptonshire. Dexxon, with annual sales of around £20-30 million, is described as Israel's second-largest pharmaceutical firm. 
<P>
It specialises in manufacturing and developing modified release products and recently opened a manufacturing and research complex at Or Akiva, Israel.
<P>
Some of the company's products - Dicloflex and Isosorbide Mononitrate - were previously available in the UK through its  distributors here, Pharmacia & Upjohn and Dominion Pharma. These will now be marketed and distributed by Dexcel-Pharma.

Trident, a wholesaler based in Stoke-on-Trent, has launched a next-day service for generics. Trident is a division of Enterprise, an OTC/generics wholesaler owned by Lloyds Chemists. Martin Taft, Trident's sales manager, says it is offering next-day delivery to gain an edge on its competitors. 
<P>
''We have been offering a weekly service for a couple of years, but we thought this market had reached saturation point because every wholesaler was doing the same thing. That's why we made this move,'' he says.
<P>
The next-day service is nation-wide and is backed by a tele- sales team that the company is developing. Mr Taft says customers' response to its new service has been very good.

Unichem has introduced personal accident insurance cover for its community pharmacy customers. The plan, involving insurance company AIG Europe, provides cover against accidental death, serious injury requiring hospital treatment and certain fractures.
<P>
Pharmacy employees can also join the scheme. Dependent children can be insured for free. Unichem says a comprehensive insurance plan can be set up for 30p per week. Those joining do not have to take a medical.

Boots the Chemists has given the pharmacy department at Queen's University, Belfast, a donation of £5,000 to help create a state of the art pharmacy teaching facility for the new century.
<P>
The money will be used to convert existing facilities into a facsimile pharmacy, complete with a proprietary dispensary and OTC section, so that students will be able to learn their profession in an up to date setting.
<P>
The unit should be completed by the end of the year and an official opening is planned for January or February next year, says Professor James McElnay, director of the school of pharmacy.

<H1><B>Continuing education in community pharmacy</B></H1>

<H1><B> -- the facts and the myths</B></H1>

<P>
All professionals need continuing education to help them maintain and develop the service they provide to clients throughout their
working life. Pharmacists and their staff are no different and need to keep abreast of both technical innovations and product
developments, and to match the changing needs and aspirations of both the public and the Health Service. But what they must
do, should do and could do all need to be clearly understood. Here, we endeavour to explain what it really means to pharmacists
and their teams.
<HR>
<A NAME="a">
<H3><B></A>Assistant training - the mystery explained</B>
</H3>

<P>
By July 1 1996, assistants working on  the pharmacy medicines counter needed to have completed, or be taking, a course that
satisfies the Royal Pharmaceutical Society's knowledge base requirements, centred on NVQ217. 
<P>
Assistants who have taken the following courses, or who had completed them by December 31, 1996, have fulfilled the Society's demands:
<P>
1.  Distributive Occupational Standards Council (DOSC)-approved  retail NVQ level 2 courses, such as those provided by the Royal
Society of the Arts and City and Guilds. New staff will be able to take these courses in the future.
<P>
2. NPA Medicine Counter Assistant Course (units 1, 2 and top-up), and the equivalent course run by Boots the Chemists for their staff.
<P>
3. RPSGB-set Multiple Choice Question papers taken by &quot;experienced assistants&quot; in January or December 1996. Assistants have two chances to take the MCQ, which is  taken in the pharmacy under the supervision of a pharmacist in defined, controlled conditions. The Society defines an &quot;experienced assistant&quot; as a person who has worked on the medicines counter for at least 16
hours a week for at least three of the last five years.
<P>
4. Courses accredited by the College of Pharmacy Practice. <I>C&ampD's</I> Cambridge Counterpart Pharmacy Assistant Development Programme is an accredited course.
<HR>
<A NAME="b"></A>
<H3><B>Continuing education for pharmacists - the accreditation jungle</B></H3>

<P>
Continuing education for pharmacists is not mandatory.  However, although the Royal Pharmaceutical Society (RPSGB), in its Code
of Ethics, suggests that pharmacists should undertake a minimum of 30 hours of continuing education a year, in July 1995 it shied
away from making a straight &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; decision on whether  CE should be mandatory. 
<P>
RPSGB Council agreed &quot;in principle&quot; to 'put in place a process for verifying pharmacists' compliance with the Code's
expectation' on the matter, and to look at how much it would all cost!  That process is now underway, but no timescale has yet
been set by the Society.
<P>
<H5><B>Points to note</B></H5>

<P>
a) As yet, the RPSGB Council has not defined what constitutes one hour's worth of CE. 
<P>
b) The only other pharmacy body requiring members to undertake CE is the College of Pharmacy Practice.  CPP members must complete
20 hours' worth of CE a year on CPP-accredited courses, logging compliance with the College by submitting course completion certificates.
<P>
c) While the Royal Pharmaceutical Society is likely to recognise one hour's learning on a CPP-accredited course as registering
one hour off its 30 hours annual CE expectation, it has not formally said as much, nor has it recognised courses provided by any other body for this purpose.
<P>
d) Any body can accredit continuing education, but until that body is recognised by the RPSGB as a provider of accredited courses
for its purposes, then hours spent learning will be of  no value in meeting the Society's  CE requirements whenever, and if, they
are formalised. 
<P>
e)  To date  only certain courses provided by the UK's  four CPPEs have been accredited by the College of Pharmacy Practice for use by pharmacists, along with some technical articles in the pharmaceutical Press.  <I>Chemist &amp; Druggist's</I> <a href="upmain.html">Pharmacy Update</a> includes accredited and assessed articles with monthly questionnaires and an optional telephone marking system.

<P>
f) Health Commissions may require community pharmacists contracted to supply pharmaceutical services, to fulfil various requirements, which could include completion of courses and on-going professional development through CE.<P>
In short, only pharmacists who are members of the CPP have any mandatory requirement to participate in CE, although all members
of the RPSGB and Pharmaceutical Society of Northern Ireland will wish to develop professionally. Until the Society defines what
is required explicitly, and makes CE mandatory for continuance in practice, the choice of course is left to the individual.

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 3.0//EN" "html.dtd"><HTML><HEAD><TITLE>dotPHARMACY: Business Trends</TITLE></HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR=#80FF80><CENTER><h1>Business Trends</h1><h3>Pharmacists confirm their RPM concerns</h3></CENTER><p><br><CENTER><STRONG>Chemist & Druggist, in association with AAH Pharmaceuticals, publishes a quarterly Business Trends survey looking at business and current affairs. This quarter, pharmacists have voiced their fears that up to 3,000 outlets could face closure if Resale Price Maintenance is abolished</STRONG></CENTER><p>Twenty-six per cent of pharmacists believe their businesses stand very little chance of remaining viable if Resale Price Maintenance is removed on OTC medicines, reports the latest Business Trends survey. However, 74 per cent are fairly confident that they would survive.<p>About a month ago, the Community Pharmacy Action Group warned that up to 3,055 pharmacists, one-quarter of Britains total, would face ruin without RPM (C&D 20 July, page 76).<p>Multiples seem to be less confident about life without RPM than independents. Just under one-third of multiples which responded feel they would not survive without RPM, compared with a fraction under one-quarter of independents.<p>Falling margins remain a major worry. Just over half the respondents say their second-quarter margins were lower than those of the same period last year, while 45 per cent say the level has not changed. Both independents and multiples are suffering, although respondents whose turnovers exceed £1 million appear to be affected less than smaller colleagues.<p>The problem is spread evenly  throughout the  UK, although it is distinctly worse in Wales. Sixty-nine per cent of respondents from that area say their margins fell in the second quarter.<p>And while a lucky few managed to increase their margins in some regions around the UK during the second quarter, no one managed to do so in Wales, the North West and the South West.<p>Matters are not expected to improve. Forty-one per cent of respondents expect depressed margins during the third quarter, and 52 per cent say the level will remain unchanged, compared with the same period last year.<p>Perhaps not surprisingly, a substantial proportion of respondents see little cause for future celebration. Forty-five per cent feel pessimistic about retail pharmacys prospects over the next quarter, rising to 50 per cent over the next six months and 52 per cent over the next 12 months.<p>The biggest pharmacies are the most pessimistic. Out of those with turnovers exceeding £1 million, 67 per cent feel gloomy about the sectors performance over the next quarter, 72 per cent about the next six months, rising to 78 per cent over the next 12 months.Generally, respondents in the North West and Wales feel more pessimistic about pharmacy than their colleagues in other regions.<p>But the situation changed when respondents were asked how they felt about their own business. Pharmacists may not have much confidence about their lot as a group, but a number have fewer reservations about their own ability to make their businesses work. Nearly one-quarter of the sample feel optimistic about their own business over the next quarter and over the next six months. And 28 per cent feel equally confident about their individual prospects over the next 12 months. <p>On the flip side, a substantial proportion still remained pessimistic about their own businesses, particularly in Scotland, the North West and Wales.<p>But pharmacists throughout the UK remain committed to their businesses. While just over a quarter of them have received offers for their outlets, nearly two-thirds have refused to sell.<p>The overall gloom could be misleading because it masks some impressive sales. Seventy-four per cent of the sample says its turnover during the second quarter - excluding NHS prescriptions - was either the same, or higher, than the same period last year. And nearly one-third expect a higher turnover during the third quarter.<p>That confidence is spread throughout the UK, with one notable exception. Just under one-third of pharmacists in Wales think their turnover next quarter will be lower than that of the same quarter last year.<p>NHS prescriptions have fared particularly well. Eighty-six per cent say the volume of prescriptions for the second quarter is at least as high or better than it was during the same period last year. And 85 per cent expect a similar result for the third quarter. Some of the best performances come from pharmacies in south west England and in Scotland. Eighty-one per cent of those in the South West and 70 per cent in Scotland say these prescriptions are up on those of the same period last year.<p>Pharmacists in most regions expect to deal with more NHS scripts in the third quarter, compared with the same period last year. But 38 per cent in Wales say their prescriptions will fall during the next quarter.<p>OTC medicines are another star area. Fifty-five per cent of the sample say their sales of OTCs are up for the second quarter. Those in the Midlands, the South West and Scotland did particularly well. However, pharmacists in the North East had relatively mixed fortunes. One-third saw their OTC sales fall during the second quarter, although these are expected to pick up during the third quarter.Forty-two per cent of the total sample expect their OTC sales to improve again next quarter.<p>In contrast, cosmetic sales are poor. More than one-third say they sold fewer cosmetics in the second quarter, and a little under one-third expect them to remain depressed during the third quarter. Only the larger pharmacies avoided a significant fall in sales during the second quarter.<p>But the real villains are fragrances, whose second quarter sales fell 54 per cent and are forecast to drop 42 per cent during the third quarter.<p>Toiletry sales are also down on those of last year, especially in the North West and Scotland.<p>With the erratic weather during spring and summer, demand for photo processing has not been as high as expected. Twenty-two per cent of pharmacists say their photoprocessing sales were down in the second quarter, although most of them believe their orders will improve during the next quarter.<p>Babycare sales are generally static, but they are proving especially bad for larger pharmacists. Forty-four per cent say their second quarter sales are down. And 56 per cent see no improvement during the third quarter. Wales, Scotland and the North West are the worst-affected regions.<p>Meanwhile, sales of analgesics, indigestion/stomach upset remedies and vitamins are generally buoyant and are expected to remain so.<P><BR><HR><li> Questionnaires were sent to 484 members of the Chemist & Druggist retail business trends panel, of which 200 replied. <li>Sixty-seven per cent of the respondents were independents, 21 per cent were multiples with two to five outlets, 7 per cent were multiples with six to 20 outlets, while 4 per cent had more than 20 outlets. One per cent of the sample did not say how many outlets they owned.  <li>Members of the panel were asked how well their businesses were doing (in terms of turnover, margins etc) for April-June 1996, compared with the same period last year. And they were asked to forecast their performance over the next three months.<P><BR><HR><H3>Pharmacist talk-back</H3>The April to June Business Trends survey asked pharmacists how much they planned to increase staff wages this year, bearing in mind the Joint Industrial Council for Retail Pharmacys recommendation of a 2.7 per cent pay increase for shop and dispensing assistants.<p>Fifty-nine per cent will increase wages by 3 per cent to 5. And 11 per cent plan to exceed 5 per cent.<p>Independents appear to be more generous than multiples: 29 per cent of the independents plan wage increases of 4 per cent or more, compared with 14 per cent of multiples.<p>Meanwhile, 81 per cent of multiples employ a locum every week, while just over half of the independents do. On average, locums work 11 hours a week and receive around £12 per hour. Independents and multiples pay identical rates, with virtually no regional variation.<p>Do pharmacists attend events? Nearly two-thirds had not attended a Royal Pharmaceutical Society branch meeting in the last quarter, and 82 per cent had not gone to a National Pharmaceutical Association branch meeting. But 52 per cent had attended a supplier-sponsored event and 46 per cent had taken part in a Centre for Pharmacy Postgraduate Education workshop. Forty-one per cent went to other professional meetings.<p>Pharmacists in Wales were less likely to attend any sort of event, workshop or meeting than colleagues elsewhere in the country.<P><BR><HR><b>Trends in volume of NHS prescriptions</b><p><table border=0><td colspan=50></td><th colspan=20>Q2 '95</th><td colspan=10></td><th colspan=20>Q3 '95</th><td colspan=10></td><th colspan=20>Q4 '95</th><td colspan=10></td><th colspan=20>Q1 '96</th><td colspan=10></td><th colspan=20>Q2 '96</th><td colspan=10></td><th colspan=20>Q3 '96</th><tr><td colspan=50>Actual balance</td><td colspan=20 align="center">50</td><td colspan=10></td><td colspan=20 align="center">21</td><td colspan=10></td><td colspan=20 align="center">58</td><td colspan=10></td><td colspan=20 align="center">30</td><td colspan=10></td><td colspan=20 align="center">42</td><tr><td colspan=50>Forecast balance</td><td colspan=20 align="center">10</td><td colspan=10></td><td colspan=20 align="center">32</td><td colspan=10></td><td colspan=20 align="center">33</td><td colspan=10></td><td colspan=20 align="center">32</td><td colspan=10></td><td colspan=20 align="center">19</td><td colspan=10></td><td colspan=20 align="center">20</td></table><p><br>The balance is the result of those saying that a particular trend is 'up' minus the proportion who said it is 'down'<p><hr><p><b>Trends in margins</b><p><table border=0><td colspan=50></td><th colspan=20>Q2 '95</th><td colspan=10></td><th colspan=20>Q3 '95</th><td colspan=10></td><th colspan=20>Q4 '95</th><td colspan=10></td><th colspan=20>Q1 '96</th><td colspan=10></td><th colspan=20>Q2 '96</th><td colspan=10></td><th colspan=20>Q3 '96</th><tr><td colspan=50>Actual balance</td><td colspan=20 align="center">-40</td><td colspan=10></td><td colspan=20 align="center">-50</td><td colspan=10></td><td colspan=20 align="center">-49</td><td colspan=10></td><td colspan=20 align="center">-50</td><td colspan=10></td><td colspan=20 align="center">-48</td><tr><td colspan=50>Forecast balance</td><td colspan=20 align="center">-39</td><td colspan=10></td><td colspan=20 align="center">-32</td><td colspan=10></td><td colspan=20 align="center">-40</td><td colspan=10></td><td colspan=20 align="center">-43</td><td colspan=10></td><td colspan=20 align="center">-40</td><td colspan=10></td><td colspan=20 align="center">-35</td></table><p><br>The balance is the result of those saying that a particular trend is 'up' minus the proportion who said it is 'down'<p><hr><p><b>Trends in sales turnover</b> (exc.

<H3><B>Smith pledges support for RPM</B></H3>
<P>

The Labour shadow health minister, Chris Smith, has given his unequivocal support for the retention of Resale Price Maintenance on medicines.
<p>
Mr Smith says he is worried about the decision of the director general of the Office of Fair Trading to refer the issue to the Restrictive Practices Court and has pledged that if an election is called before the Court reached a decision, it is a situation Labour 	"would try to unpick". 
<p>
Mr Smith was speaking on Tuesday at a conference on Healthcare in the Community hosted by the Social Market Foundation and sponsored by Boots the Chemists. Further details in this week's issue of Chemist &amp Druggist magazine.

<A NAME="b"></A>
<H3><B>Somerfield includes medicines in loyalty scheme</B></H3>
<P>

Medicines are being included in a supermarket chain's loyalty scheme, despite concerns that it may encourage unnecessary purchases of medicines.
<p>
Following adverse publicity and customer comments on the marketing of baby milks, Somerfield Stores withdrew infant milk formulas from its Premium Points scheme. However, Somerfield spokesman Gideon Bohannon says the company has no plans to exclude medicines at this stage.
<p>
The company has taken legal advice and says it is not breaking any laws. 

<P>
<A HREF="#top">Top of page</A>
<HR>
<A NAME="c"></A>
<H3><B>VAT exemption ruling</B></H3>
<P>

A VAT tribunal has decreed that incontinence pads are exempt from VAT when supplied by NHS trusts to patients in their own homes and to nursing home patients who are 'of sound mind'. But pads supplied to people in residential homes should still be subject to VAT because they are not being supplied directly to specific patients. 
<p>
SCA Molnlycke had appealed against a Customs & Excise ruling that VAT should be applied to all NHS incontinence products. The company is considering whether to appeal further against the judgment.

<H3><B>High Court appeal lost</B></H3>
<P>

A pharmacist appealing against a decision preventing him from transferring his pharmacy into a nearby Tesco store lost his battle in London's High Court last week. 
<p>
Justice Harrison ruled that the Family Health Services Appeal Authority, which refused pharmacist Rajiv Sharma of Ilford, Essex, permission, had been neither wrong in law nor unreasonable.

<P>
<A HREF="#top">Top of page</A>
<HR>
<A NAME="e"></A>
<H3><B>Organon set for appeal</B></H3>
<P>

Organon seems likely to appeal to the Medicines Commission to overturn the Committee on Safety of Medicines advice on oral contraceptives.
<p>
The CSM advised in 1995 that the use of Pills containing gestodene or desogestrel should be restricted. But new research has shown no significant difference in the incidence of venous thrombo-embolism in women taking second or third generation Pills.
<p>
Researchers examined the medical records of 540,000 women in a study designed to avoid what they describe as possible bias in earlier research. This included adjusting for age factors which might have contributed to the higher risk ratio. <EM>(Lancet)</EM>

<H3><B>Wyeth launches Genus Pharmaceuticals</B></H3>
<P>

Wyeth Laboratories has set up a new company - Genus Pharmaceuticals - which specialises in multi-source products.
<p>
Wyeth has been working on Genus, which will be launched formally next week, since at least last August. The new company is a natural extension for Wyeth, which also has interests in Germany and the USA.

<P>

Co-op Health Care has acquired three more pharmacies, lifting its total to 58. The new outlets are the Cooper Clark pharmacies in Bickerstaffe, St Helens and Rainford, and C A Welsby in High Town, Sandbach.
<P>
Co-op Health Care, owned by United Norwest Co-op, has doubled in size during the past year and plans to acquire more pharmacies over the next two months.

<A NAME="j"></A>
<H3><B>AAH to phase in new warehousing system</B></H3>
<P>

AAH Pharmaceuticals will begin to phase in a new warehousing system based on procedures adopted by its sister companies in France and Germany
<p>
It will be launched next Monday at AAH's new 60,000sq ft warehouse in Ruislip, which is about 300ft from the company's established warehouse. It has also installed most of the system at its depot in Romford. Depots in Leeds, Warrington and Glasgow will take on the system - in that order - by the year end, followed by Bristol next year.
<p>
The company says the new system is the first in the UK to offer a despatch sorting service to speed-up deliveries, which allows depots to process more tote boxes per hour and enables van drivers to identify their loads quicker.

Today, more than at any other time, community pharmacists need to be able to practise effectively both as healthcare professionals and as business people. The NHS supplier/provider free market does not give automatic respect to people or professions. Individual pharmacists and their businesses have to be able to practise what they preach - to deliver services required by patients or their health authorities accurately, cost-effectively and when and where required.
<P>
The first stage in the Certificate in Community Pharmacy Management comprises ten free monthly learning modules that will help you get to grips with the business practise skills needed to manage your community pharmacy in this ever more competitive environment. 
<p>
The modules are free, only to Chemist &amp; Druggist subscribers or to pharmacists/pharmacies which are on the requested mailing list for Community Pharmacy. Both magazines belong to Miller Freeman Pharmacy Group.
<p>
<CENTER><H3>Distance learning for the community pharmacist business professional</H3></CENTER>

The ten-part modular course will be delivered free in Chemist &amp; Druggist and Community Pharmacy every month through to September 1997 thanks to support from SmithKline Beecham Consumer Healthcare.
<p>
Each module will cover a specifice business skill and will include a number of relevant case studies and 40 self-test true/false questions.
<p>
The ten modules comprise the first 50 hours of the 100-hour certificate in Community Pharmacy developed by the School of Pharmacy, The Queen's University, Belfast.
<p>
The second 50 hour section consists of five ten-hour projects set by the university every six weeks from January 1997. They will be marked sequentially and moderated by the university - pharmacists must complete and pass each project before the next is issued. Pharmacists registered for both parts will have access to a course tutor.
<p>
Students who pass will be awarded a Certificate in Community Pharmacy Management by the School of Pharmacy, The Queen's University, Belfast. The first awards are expected in Autumn of 1997.
<p>
Qualifying pharmacists can obtain further information by emailing <A HREF="mailto:chemdrug@dotpharmacy.com">chemdrug@dotpharmacy.com</a> for the attention of Sue Cheesman or Claire Newman

 <H1>FACILITIES WORKING GROUP HOME PAGE </H1> <p>

 </HEAD>

 <BODY>


 <H4>The Facilities Working Group of the Federal Geographic Data
Committee (FGDC) was created in January 1995 and has met monthly to
address data issues that will enhance facility management.  A facility is
an entity with location which is deliberately established as a site for
designated activities.  A facility database might describe a factory,
military base, college, hospital, power plant, fishery, national park, office
building, space command center, or a prison. </H4> <p>

 <A NAME="help"> <H3>Details on the search query form... </H3> </A>

This form collects search terms which are formulated into WAIS queries by several
intermediate perl scripts.
 <A NAME="Keywords">
 <H3>Search Keywords </H3>
Type into this box any words which are relevant to the topic you are
looking for.  Enter as many as you want, up to 40 characters total (the
entry box will scroll as necessary).  At the present time, this field 
is global for the document, so it finds matching words no matter
what field of the metadata it appeared in. In the future, 
searches on Theme_Keyword and Place_Keyword will be implemented.
 <!-- To aid your searches we have provided an
  <A HREF = "http://badger.state.wi.us/agencies/wlib/sco/pages/globalphindx.html">alphabetical </A>
 and a  <A HREF = "http://badger.state.wi.us/agencies/wlib/sco/pages/globfreqindx.html">frequency </A> 
listing of words contained in these metadata documents. -->
 <P> 
These are the essential characteristics of the Search Keyword Field: <BR>
 <UL>
 <LI>Boolean operations are supported
 <blockquote>
By default, all keywords are logically ORed.  To find documents that contain
all of several keywords, use AND.  To exclude documents based on keywords, use 
NOT. Use parenthesis to construct complex queries.
 </blockquote> 
 <LI>Word proximity has no effect
 <blockquote>
The index is created wordwise, thus it will find documents that contain as a seqential string
the keywords you have supplied, and documents that contain the individual keywords, but separated 
in the document.  For example
using  <EM>tax parcel </EM> in the Search Keywords field will find documents that contain the strings
 <EM>tax parcel </EM>, or  <EM>take this parcel down to the tax assessor's office </EM>. 
 </blockquote>
 <LI>Case insensitive
 <LI>Will not find synonyms (yet)
 <blockquote>
A search for hydrology will not find documents that do not contain the word hydrology, but do
contain the words river or lake.  In the future we hope to be able to implement synonym
searching.
 </blockquote>
 </UL>
 <H3>AND/OR for a spatial search... </H3>
This is a little misleading, sorry.  What it means is that you can do a keyword search
 <EM>only </EM>, and not further limit the search results by also specifying a spatial region 
(note that no county or geographic region is initially selected).  OR you can do a spatial search  <EM>only </EM> by specifying the search area, but not specifying any keywords. You
make your search more specific by supplying keywords AND a spatial region. 

 <H3>a bounding box in latitude and longitude (decimal degrees) </H3>
Hats off to anyone who knows the bounding box for Outagamie county in latitude and longitude.  If your mind works this way, however, maybe you've forgotten that latitude goes in the north and south boxes.  Don't get fancy with degrees minutes seconds.  This system only supports decimal degrees, like, e.g. -89.4435
 <H3>Search </H3>
At a minimim, you will get one result returned from the search.  If you are unlucky, your search produced no results, and the returned document will just be an index of all the documents contained in this index.  If you were lucky, your search produced one or more results related to your search.  The search query also scores the documents.  Those documents which fit best with your search query will have the highest score.  The second number returned by the search query is the length of the ASCII text document that formed the original metadata document, and upon which the index was created.

 <TITLE>FEDERAL GEOGRAPHIC DATA COMMITTEE </TITLE>
 <H1>FACILITIES WORKING GROUP </H1>
REVISED 26 January 1995 <p>

 <H3>Scope: </H3>
 <H4> 
	A Facilities Working Group will be established to work within the Federal 
Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) and with other non-Federal communities to 
enhance facility management.  A facility is an entity with location, 
deliberately established as a site for designated activities.  Facility 
Management involves the planning, operation, and maintenance of facilities to 
insure that they perform their intended purpose in an effective and efficient 
manner and in harmony with environmental and other socio-economic constraints. <P>
	The objectives of the Working Group will be to: promote standards of 
accuracy and currentness in facilities data which is financed in whole in part 
by Federal funds; exchange information on technological improvements for 
collecting facilities data; encourage the Federal and non-Federal community to 
identify and adopt standards and specifications for facilities data; and to 
promote the sharing of facilities data among Federal and non-Federal 
organizations. <P>
     A facility database might describe a factory, a military base, a college, 
a hospital, a power plant, a fishery, a national park, an office building, a 
space command center, or a prison.  The database for a complex facility may 
describe multiple functions or missions, multiple buildings, or even a county, 
town, or city. <P>
     The variety and breadth of a facility results in databases with a variety 
of themes or categories of information and as such, the Facilities Working 
Group is interested in the data standards being developed by other FGDC 
subcommittees and working groups.  The Facilities Working Group recognizes the 
need to coordinate with these other FGDC entities to develop standards for the 
more detailed, larger scale, and higher resolution data that are not currently 
a priority of other FGDC subcommittees, yet are required by the facilities 
community.  Since facility data will often be the most accurate and detailed 
data available for a geographic location, this data could represent a 
significant contribution to the National Geospatial Data "Framework".  The 
Facilities Working Group recognizes the need to coordinate with the Framework 
Working Group in this arena. <P>
     The Facilities Working Group will have specific responsibility for 
addressing data issues for data that is not currently represented by other 
FGDC subcommittees such as utilities (water, gas, electric, storm sewer, 
wastewater, industrial waste, telephone, radio, cable TV, satellite), 
environmental hazards (HTRW, land, water, air, and noise pollution), 
airspace safety, firing ranges, explosive ordnance safety, and training ranges. <P>
     Since facility management can involve processing and integrating high and 
low resolution data and large and small scale data, the Facilities Working 
Group recognizes its opportunity to be a link between the FGDC and other 
entities such as the National Institute for Building Sciences (NIBS) and the 
American Public Works Association (APWA). <P>
 </H4>

 <H3>Activities: </H3> <P>
 <h4>
Specific activities of the Working Group include: <P>

Promote the coordination of agencies' facilities related activities and 
exchange of facilities data and guidance, by formal and informal means. <P>

Collect and compile information on Federal agencies' facilities related data 
activities. <P>

Data for a specific facility can be created and maintained using multiple 
systems such as Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Computer-Aided Drafting 
and Design (CADD), Automated Mapping/Facilities Management (AM/FM), and Land 
Information Systems (LIS) and their associated databases.  Develop guidelines 
on integrating data created using these various technologies. <P>

Data sources for a specific facility can be in various resolutions.  Develop 
guidelines on integrating multiple resolution data sets for a single site. <P>

Develop a features and attribute register for facilities data that is not 
currently represented by other FGDC Subcommittees.  Develop this per the FGDC 
Process for Standards Development and also submit this to the Spatial Data 
Transfer Standard(SDTS)/Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 173 Task 
Force for possible incorporation into the FIPS 173. <P>

A facilities database can contain 50 or more themes of data, all with varying 
resolution and accuracy.  The database may also contain sensitive data that 
should have controlled access.  Develop any additional guidance needed for 
documenting facilities data sets with the FGDC Content Standard for Digital 
Metadata. <P>

Support the development of SDTS/FIPS 173 profiles which will be suited to 
facilities data, such as SDTS CADD profiles. <P>

Work with the non-Federal community such as the public utility companies, 
county fire and rescue units, AM/FM International, the American Public Works 
Association (APWA), the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), the American
 Architects Society, the National Institute for Building Sciences (NIBS), the 
Federal Facilities Council (FCC), the Urban and Regional Information Systems 
Association (URISA), and the American Institute of Architects (AIA). <P>
 </H4>

 <H3>Duration: </H3> <P>
 <H4>
The Facilities Working Group will operate for 1-2 years, or until a permanent 
management/coordination process for facilities data is established, such as an 
FGDC subcommittee.  <P>
 </H4>



 <H3>Linkages: </H3> <P>
 <H4>
The Facilities Working Group will have close ties with all FGDC subcommittees, 
working groups, and member agencies; National Institute of Standards and 
Technology (NIST); interested local and state governments; public utility 
companies; professional societies such as APWA, ASCE, and AM/FM International; 
NIBS; and the private sector.  <P>
 </H4>

 <H3>Agency lead: </H3> <P>
 <H4>
The Working Group shall be chaired by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.  The 
Corps of Engineers represents DoD's facilities/civil works interests to the 
FGDC and is also a member of the Tri-Service CADD/GIS Technology Center 
oversight group. The Center is responsible for the coordination of CADD and GIS
technologies throughout the DoD Installations and Facilities community and will 
provide critical support to this Working Group, especially in the area of 
standards. <P>

 </h3>

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) has a server on the Internet on which they store and make available to all interested persons geospatial data and metadata. It is the USACE node of the National Geospatial Data Clearinghouse. Throughout this document the server is called the Geospatial Server or the Server.  Its network name is corps_geo1.usace.army.mil (IP address 144.3.144.20). It uses anonymous ftp, World Wide Web (WWW or web) and limited-access ftp processes to enable users to submit and access geospatial data and metadata.

 <p>
The multiple facets of the Server are described in this report, including:
 <p>
<ul>
<li>The process for submitting metadata to the Server
<p>
<li> The process for submitting geospatial <I>data</I> to the Server. When the process
of receiving data is automated on the Server this section will be revised.
<p>
<li>The processes to find and access data and metadata from the Server
<p>
<li>  The Geospatial Server WWW pages at
http://corps_geo1.usace.army.mil
 </ul>

USACE Geospatial Data Server:<br>
Manual on how to submit and access data and metadata </h3>

<h1>B.  Responsibilities of the Geospatial Data and Systems
Point of Contact </h1>
 <b>
Version: 22 November 1996
 </b>
<p>

USACE Engineer Regulation 1110-1-8156 requires that a Geospatial Data and Systems point of contact (GD&S POC) be designated by each command.  Their responsibilities are defined in detail in the Engineer Regulation. They will act as the liaison between their geospatial data community and Corps Headquarters, and thus will also be the POCs between their command and the Server administrators. 
<p>
As stated in the Engineer Regulation, with reference to the Server the GD&S POC's responsibilities include the following: "As new data pages are developed on the USACE Clearinghouse node by HQUSACE for the Commands, GD&S POCs will review  the pages and provide corrections to the Webmaster. Annually, the GD&S POC will review the Command's geospatial data pages on the USACE Clearinghouse node and forward any updates to the Webmaster."
<p>
In addition, POCs should consider the following areas of concern within their command's geospatial data community:
 <p>
 <ul>
<li>the system of filenames used to name data and 
metadata files by persons within their command,

 <li>records of the Server filenames that will extend beyond each employees time of service, and

<li>coordination with their information management group.
 </ul>

<strong>The data described in the metadata files produced by the US Army 
Corps of Engineers represent the results of data collection and processing 
for a specific US Army Corps of Engineers activity and indicates the general
existing conditions.  As such it is only valid for its intended use, 
content, time, and accuracy specifications.  The user is responsible
for the results of any application of the data for other than its intended
purpose.
 </strong> 
<p>
Please note that data and metadata files are currently being accepted on the Corps Geospatial Server. Read
<a href = "ht-submit.html">Section C</a> of this document for information about metadata submission procedures and  <a href = "ht-dsubmit.html">Section D</a> for information about data submission. 
<p>
 <strong>
 <a name = "metadata">
E1. USACE metadata</a>
</strong>
<br>
The USACE geospatial data and metadata available on the web include <I>collection metadata</I> and all other metadata. Collection metadata is a single metadata file that describes a series of related data files that are routinely collected by an agency. For example, the data may be hydrographic files which have been collected for 20 years. 
USACE Headquarters has created a series of templates of collection metadata files for USACE commands to edit or delete, as appropriate. Links to these are found under each command's data pages. 

<p>
Other metadata files may describe a unique data file or a unique collection of data files, i.e. a collection of data files that are not routinely collected by an agency. On the USACE Server these are called <I>detailed metadata</I>.

<p>
All metadata files name the Point of Contact for the data set described and state how the data can be obtained. In the future, there will be links from the metadata to data sets for data which is available on the Server. Commands will decide which of their data products to make available on the Server.

<p>
<strong>
<a name =  "access">
E2. Accessing data via metadata: keyword search, image maps, USACE command list</a>.
</strong>
<br>
There are four ways to search for data on the USACE Server. To determine is the data is appropriate for your use, you can access the corresponding metadata file and read about the specifications of the data. The four search tools include:

<ol>
<li> A WWW form to do a  keyword search, 
<li> Image maps,
<li> A textual list of USACE commands  and
<li> Anonymous ftp.
</ol>
<p>
Anonymous ftp will be described in the next section of this document.
There are links on the Server homepage to the textual 
<a href = "../org.direct.html">USACE command list</a> 
(<I>see</I> Locating USACE Metadata using a list of 
USACE Commands) and to the 
<a href = "../metadata.html">image maps</a> 
(<I>see</I> Locating USACE Metadata using maps). 
Both of these links lead to the
same command data pages. From the data pages, there are links 
to the command's collection and detailed metadata pages.
<p>
A link to a 
<a href = "query.html">keyword search form</a>
is also is available from the Server homepage (<I>see</I>
Search USACE and NSDI Clearinghouse metadata
databases using a form). The keyword 
search allows you to enter a keyword or keywords which 
describe the subject in which you are interested.
The search can be limited to metadata
 from only specific USACE commands.
The USACE geospatial metadata is spatially indexed.
This means that you can add geographic coordinates 
to the search statement, limiting the search to only the geographic area in 
which you are interested. Details of how to enter keywords
are found at the bottom of the keyword search form.
<p>
 <strong>
 <a name = "ftp">
E3. Accessing Corps metadata using anonymous ftp</a>
</strong>
 <br>
You also can get metadata or data by using anonymous  
ftp (file transfer protocol) originating from your local computer.
 This will allow you to download metadata or data
files to your computer. You do not need to have a Corps UPASS 
user id. Use your computer's ftp utility. 
 If you don't know how to use the ftp utility on your computer,
 you'll have to ask a knowledgeable neighbor or your desktop
 support team. 

<p>
The host computer you are ftp-ing to is
<dl>
 <dd><kbd>corps_geo1.usace.army.mil</kbd>
 </dl>

The login id is

<dl>
<dd><kbd>anonymous</kbd>
</dl>

and for a password you can use your email address.
<p>
 When you log on the anonymous ftp site you are at the top
of the Server ftp directory structure. There you will see the 
names <I>labs</I> and <I>foa</I> (field operating activities),
and acronyms for the divisions. Entering these directories will lead you
to directories of the subordinate commands which 
contain a metadata  and a geo_data directory.  The difficulty 
of using anonymous ftp is that if you do not  know exactly 
where to find what you want, you must browse around the 
directories seeking it. 
<p>
When you are done with the ftp session, close it and 
exit from the ftp software. If you stop 
communicating with the ftp site for some 
period of time during the ftp session,
you may be "timed out," i.e. you will not be connected 
to the Server anymore.  If this occurs you will have to 
ftp to the Server again.

C1. Accessing the Server for metadata submission
 </a>
 </b>
 <br>
Three steps are needed to get access to the Server for metadata submission.

 <p>
1. Inform the Geospatial Data and Systems (GD&S) POC for your organization that you  intend to submit metadata to the Server. The name and contact information for the GD&S POC of each USACE command is shown on the command's data page on the Server web site. You can get to a command's  data page via an
<a href = "../org.direct.html">alphabetical list</a>
or an 
<a href = "../metadata.html">image map</a>. A list of USACE GD&S POCs  is available for downloading in 
<a href = "ftp://corps_geo1.usace.army.mil/pub/gd_and_s/">
WordPerfect6.0 format</a> on the web site also. 
 
 <p>
2.  To put metadata files on the USACE Geospatial  Server you must get a Corps UPASS user id that is recognized by the Server.  This is the same UPASS user id that is recognized by the Server for data submission. The Corps standard UPASS system will be used for issuing and controlling user ids and passwords.  To get a UPASS user id, ask your UPASS administrator for a "UPASS user id on the Geospatial Metadata and Data Server on corps_geo1." To find out who your UPASS administrator is, contact your information management group.

 <p>
3.  The system administrator of the Geospatial Data Server must have your email address before the automatic metadata submission process will work. You can use the <a href = "../user-id1.html">Corps_geo1 Access Form</a> or email your email address with a message saying that you have requested access to the Server to

 <dl>

<a href="mailto:webmaster@corps_geo1.usace.army.mil">

 </dl>
<p>

 <a name = "meta">
C2. Metadata file format
 </a>
 </b>
 <br>
All metadata files submitted to the Server should conform to the Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata, published 8 June 1994.  This is in conformance with USACE Engineer Regulation 1110-1-8156. The FGDC Standard can be viewed in an HTML format at the URL
<p>
<dl>
<dd>
<a href = "http://geochange.er.usgs.gov/pub/tools/metadata/standard/">
http://geochange.er.usgs.gov/pub/tools/metadata/standard/</a>
</dl>
<p>
It also can be downloaded (ftped) in various file formats with the name
meta6894.<i>ext</i> where .<i>ext</i> is the filename extension of a 
particular file format type. The URL for downloading is
 
<p>
<dl>
<dd>
<a href = "ftp://www.fgdc.gov/pub/metadata/">
ftp://www.fgdc.gov/pub/metadata/</a>
</dl>
<p>
Metadata files should be in ASCII text format or they will be unreadable on the Server.
<p>
The Corps metadata generator software package, CORPSMET, creates metadata in the correct format. CORPSMET can be 
<a href = "ftp://corps_geo1.uasce.army.mil">downloaded</a>
from this site. Other GIS and metadata generator software packages also are available.
<p>
It is recommended that you check your metadata using the mp (metadata parser) formal metadata compiler created by Peter Schweitzer, USGS, which will tell you if your metadata file has formatting errors or field omissions. Descriptions of the files and the source code for the metadata compiler and its related programs are available at 
<a href = "http://geochange.er.usgs.gov/pub/tools/metadata">
http://geochange.er.usgs.gov/pub/tools/metadata</a> under the bullet
"A complier for formal metadata."
<p>
In the future, files will have to pass through this metadata parser as part of the USACE Server acceptance process. This will be necessary when the Server must change from WAIS to Isite indexing to comply with the National Spatial Data Clearinghouse standards. Three types of errors will cause the metadata file to be rejected, including unrecognized elements, misplaced elements, and missing elements. As explained by Mr. Schweitzer, "mp is extremely picky by design, and most metadata has some flaws.  The most recent
version of mp classifies errors as, in order of decreasing severity:
<p>
  unrecognized elements<br>
  misplaced elements<br>
  missing elements<br>
  superfluous elements<br>
  empty elements (missing values) <br>
  improper element values
<p>
It's my hope that this classification will help people put proper
perspective in their handling of the errors.  The Clearinghouse
won't work well with metadata that have unrecognized or misplaced
elements, and missing elements will make the metadata less useful,
but the other errors are probably more tolerable." (Personal  communication, Dec. 1996)

C3.  Filename conventions
 </a>
 </b>
 <br>
When the metadata file arrives at the Server, a script runs that uses the filename extension to determine how it will handle the file. Original metadata files should have the extension .met. Other extensions are used for files that are to replace other files (.rep) or to be deleted (.del) and for data files (.dat).  When you ftp the file to the Server you can make the name as long as you want and so can add the .met to the filename you used on your PC. All filenames should consist of a <b>continuous</b> string of characters which may include  numbers, letters, underscore ( _ ), hyphen (-), and dot ( . ). Other special characters should be avoided.
<p>
In the past, metadata filenames were changed as they were moved to the Server metadata storage area. (User-id, date and time were added to the original name.) This no longer occurs. The GD&S POCs and persons submitting metadata are responsible for keeping track of the filenames of the command's metadata. The filename will be needed if the metadata has to be replaced, updated or deleted in the future.  The filenames currently in a command's metadata directory can be seen by  using anonymous ftp to get to the command's metadata directory (see Section E, Accessing Corps geospatial data and metadata).

 <a name = "submit">
C4.  Submitting metadata to the Server
 </a>
 </b>
 <br>
To put a metadata file on the Geospatial Server, follow 
these steps.

 <p>
1. Plan your filename. Remember to use the .met
extension for metadata file submissions.
<p>
2. Use your computer's ftp utility. There are many variations of ftp software. It would be impossible to describe them all. If you don't know how to use the ftp utility on your computer, you'll have to ask a knowledgeable neighbor or your desktop support team. 

<p>
3. The host computer you are ftp-ing to is
<dl>
 <dd>corps_geo1.usace.army.mil
 </dl>

The login id and password you will use are your UPASS user id and password. When you have successfully ftp'ed to corps_geo1, you will be in your home directory on the Server. This is the only place on the Server where you can put files. 

 <p>
5. To submit the metadata file, you will use the <I>copy</I> or <I>put</I> function in your ftp software. 
You can submit multiple files during one session if you want to.
 
<p>
6. When you are done putting metadata on the Server, close the session and exit from the ftp software. If you stop communicating with the ftp site for some period of time during the ftp session,
you may be "timed out," i.e. you will not be connected to the Server anymore.  If this occurs you will have to ftp to the Server again.

 <p>
7. If a metadata submission is successfully processed you will receive an email message saying
so.  If the file is not successfully processed, you will receive an email message the next day stating this and explaining why it was not successfully processed..
 
 <p>
 <b>
 <a name = "replace">
C5. Replacing or deleting metadata files 
 </a>
 </b>
 <br>
To replace or delete a metadata file, you will need to
know the exact filename of the file to be replaced or 
deleted. You can use anonymous ftp to go to your
organization's metadata directory to look for the filename you need.
(Login procedures for anonymous ftp are 
different from the UPASS user id login.  Directions for logging into
anonymous ftp, listing filenames, and viewing ASCII files are given
below in Section E3, Accessing Corps metadata using 
anonymous ftp. ) If you are trying to replace or delete files that originally you did not put on the Server, you will have to contact the webmaster (webmaster@crrel.usace.army.mil) to become the owner of that file or set of files.
<p>
<u>To replace (or update) a metadata file</u>, have the replacement file ready on your local computer. The filename of the replacement file should be in the format

 <dl>
 <dd><I>filename(.met)</I>.rep
 </dl>
 
where  <i>filename(.met)</i> is the filename of the file to be replaced.  It will end with .met so the filename you type here will end with .met.rep. The extension .rep will cause the Server to replace the metadata file currently in your command's metadata directory with the file you just put in your home directory.
<p>
Ftp to the corps_geo1
computer as described in the directions given for submitting metadata 
(Section C4).  Use your UPASS user id and password to log in.  Then use the ftp utility <I>put</I> or <I>copy</I> function to put the file onto the Server. When you are done, close the ftp session and quit the ftp utility.
<p>
<u>To delete a metadata file</u>, first create a dummy file on your local
computer with the same filename as the name of the file you want to delete.  It doesn't matter what is in the dummy file. The dummy filename should be in the format
 
 <dl>
 <dd> <i> filename(.met)</i>.del
 </dl>

where <I>filename(.met)</i> is the name of the dummy file you created on your local computer 
<I>and</I> the filename of the file to be deleted.   It will end with .met so the filename will
end with .met.del. The extension .del will cause the Server to delete
the metadata file you have named.
<p>
Ftp to the Server as described 
above in the directions given above for submitting metadata
(Section C4).  Use
your UPASS user id and password to log in.  Then use the ftp utility <I>put</I> or <I>copy</I> function to put the dummyfile on the Server. Close your ftp session and quit the ftp utility.
<p>
As always, problems or questions can be address to your GD&S POC and then the webmaster.

Please note that data and metadata files are currently being accepted on the Corps Geospatial Server. Read
<a href = "ht-submit.html">Section C</a> of this document for information about metadata submission procedures.
Corps personnel and  non-Corps people can search, view and obtain data and metadata by browsing  the WWW site, WAIS keyword searches and  anonymous ftp.  See 
<a href = "ht-access.html">Section E</a> for more information on accessing data and metadata.
<p>
If you have questions about anything in this document, you can ask your GD&S POC. If  you need further assistance, please email your questions or comments to the Server webmaster at

D1. Accessing the Server for data submission
 </a>
 </b>
 <br>
<p>
1. Inform the Geospatial Data and Systems (GD&S) POC for your organization that you  intend to submit data to the Server. The name and contact information for the GD&S POC of each USACE command is shown on the command's data page on the Server web site. You can get to a command's  data page via an
<a href = "../org.direct.html">alphabetical list</a>
or an 
<a href = "../metadata.html">image map</a>. A list of USACE GD&S POCs  is available for downloading in 
<a href = "ftp://corps_geo1.usace.army.mil/pub/gd_and_s/">
WordPerfect6.0 format</a> on the web site also. 
 <p>
2.  To put data files on the USACE Geospatial  Server you must get a Corps UPASS user id that is recognized by the Server. This is the same UPASS user id that is recognized for submitting metadata.  The Corps standard UPASS system will be used for issuing and controlling user ids and passwords.  To get a UPASS user id, ask your UPASS administrator for a "UPASS user id on the Geospatial Metadata and Data Server on corps_geo1." To find out who your UPASS administrator is, contact your information management group.
<p>
3.  The system administrator of the Geospatial Data Server must have your email address. If he already has your address because you have submitted metadata, you do not need to send it again. If you do need to send it you can use the <a href = "../user-id1.html">Corps_geo1 User-id Request Form</a> or email your email address with a message saying that you have requested access to the Server to

 <dl>
 <dd> 
<a href="mailto:webmaster@corps_geo1.usace.army.mil">
webmaster@corps_geo1.usace.army.mil</a>
 </dl>
<p>
 <b>
 <a name = "submit">
D2. Submitting data.
 </a>
 </b>
 <br>
The producers of geospatial data are responsible for the integrity, maintenance, and storage of the data that they produce. Data in any format will be accepted at this time. There are a few thing to do when submitting data.

<p>
1. You must use the extension .dat at the end of the filename. When you ftp the file to the Server you can make the name as long as you want and so can add the .dat to the filename you used on your PC. All filenames should consist of a <b>continuous</b> string of characters which may include  numbers, letters, underscore ( _ ), hyphen (-), and dot ( . ). Other special characters should be avoided.
<p>
2. A corresponding metadata file should be submitted at the same time or already be on the Server. The metadata file should have the same name as the data file, except have the extension .met instead of .dat.
<p>
3. Submit data by ftp-ing the data file to your home directory on the Server. (A brief description of ftp-ing is available in the section below for those who are not familiar with the process.)
<p>
4. Until the process of putting data on the Server is automated,  you <b><I>must </b></I> also send an email message to the webmaster (webmaster@corps_geo1.usace.army.mil) with your UPASS user id and the names of the data file and corresponding metadata file. 
<p>
 <b>
 <a name = "replace">
D3. Details about ftp-ing 
 </a>
 </b>
 <br>
<p>

To ftp a data file on the Geospatial Server, follow 
these steps.
 <p>
1. Plan your filename. Remember to use the .dat
extension for metadata file submissions.
<p>
2. Use your computer's ftp utility. There are many variations of ftp software. It would be impossible to describe them all. If you don't know how to use the ftp utility on your computer, you'll have to ask a knowledgeable neighbor or your desktop support team. 

<p>
3. You will need the following information to use ftp:  

The host computer you are ftp-ing to is
<dl>
 <dd>corps_geo1.usace.army.mil
 </dl>

The login id and password you will use are your UPASS user id and password. When you have successfully ftp'ed to corps_geo1, you will be in your home directory on the Server. This is the only place on the Server where you can put files. 

 <p>
5. To submit the data file, you will use the <I>copy</I> or <I>put</I> function in your ftp software. 
You can submit multiple files during one session.
 
<p>
6. When you are done putting data on the Server, close the session and exit from the ftp software. If you stop communicating with the ftp site for some period of time during the ftp session,
you may be "timed out," i.e. you will not be connected to the Server anymore.  If this occurs you will have to ftp to the Server again.

 <p>
 <b>
 <a name = "replace">
D4. Replacing or deleting data files 
 </a>
 </b>
 <br>
To replace or delete a data file, you will need to
know the exact filename of the file to be replaced or 
deleted. You can use anonymous ftp to go to your
organization's data directory to look for the filename you need.
(Login procedures for anonymous ftp are 
different from the UPASS user id login.  Directions for logging into
anonymous ftp, listing filenames, and viewing ASCII files are given
below in Section E3, Accessing Corps data and metadata. )
<p>
Until the automatic system is set up to accept data, to replace or delete data you should contact the webmaster at 
<a href = "mailto:cadams@crrel.usace.army.mil">
cadams@crrel.usace.army.mil</a> or 603-646-4320.

<p>
&nbsp; <P>
<B>1. Development of a Facility ID Data Standard.</B>   This effort was approved by the FGDC Standards Working Group.  The scope of the effort is to develop a Facility ID data standard that supports identification of place-based objects that are generally known as facilities.  Details for this effort are included in the <B><A HREF="facility/fid.pro">proposal</A></B> that was submitted to the Standards Working Group as well as a <B><A HREF="facility/fid-dft.wp6"> draft base document for the standard</A></B>.  <p>
<p>
If you are interested in working on the development of this standard contact <B><A HREF="mailto:bargmeyer.bruce@epamail.epa.gov">Mr. Bruce Bargmeyer</A></B>, project team leader.<p>
<P>
There are two <A Href="reflector.html">email lists</A> established to facilitate communication with this group.
<p>
<p>
&nbsp; <P>
<B>2. Development of a Utilities Geospatial Data Content Standard.  </B>This effort was approved by the FGDC Standards Working Group. The scope of the effort is to develop a nationally focused Utilities Geospatial Data Content Standard that supports intra-city applications such as large-scale engineering and life-cycle maintenance of utility systems.  Details for this effort are included in the <B><A HREF="facility/utility.pro">proposal</A></B> that was submitted to the FGDC Standards Working Group.<p>
<p>
The Facilities Working Group project team for this standard has extracted the attributes, entities, domains, and domain values from the utility portion of the <B><A HREF="http://fwgcom.wes.army.mil/projects/standard/tssds/">Tri-Service CADD/GIS Technology Center's Tri-Service Spatial Data Standards (TSSDS)</A></B> as a first draft of a national standard.  Files containing these attributes, entities, domains, and domain values are: <p>

<p>
<p>
&nbsp; <P>
<B>3. Development of an Environmental Hazards Geospatial Data Content Standard.</B>  The FGDC Standards Working Group asked that the Facilities Working Group revise its proposal for development of this standard. The scope of the effort is to develop a nationally focused Environmental Hazards Geospatial Data Content Standard that supports the study, management, and remediation of hazardous waste.  A project team is working on the required revisions to the proposal, however general details for this effort are included in the first <B><A HREF="facility/envhaz.pro">proposal</A></B> that was submitted to the Standards Working Group.<p>
<p>
If you are interested in working on the development of this standard contact <B><A HREF="mailto:bargmeyer.bruce@epamail.epa.gov">Mr. Bruce Bargmeyer</A></B>, project team leader.<p>
<p>
<p>
&nbsp; <P>
<B>4. Development of an SDTS/FIPS 173 CADD Profile.</B>  This effort was approved by the FGDC Standards Working Group. The scope of the effort is to develop a profile for the Spatial Data Transfer Standard/Federal Information Processing Standard 173 (SDTS/FIPS 173) to support the exchange and transfer of CADD spatial data.  Details for this effort are included in the <B><A HREF="facility/sdtscadd.pro">proposal</A></B> that was submitted to the Standards Working Group.  <p>
<p>
Under the auspices of the Facilities Working Group, the Tri-Service CADD/GIS Technology Center investigated this topic.  This work began prior to finalization of  the FGDC standards development process.  Their findings are summarized in: <B><A HREF="facility/cadd-aut.wp6">Development of a Spatial Data Transfer Standard (SDTS) Profile for the Translation of AutoCAD&reg; CADD Elements</A></B> and <B><A HREF="facility/cadd-int.wp6">Development of a Spatial Data Transfer Standard (SDTS) Profile for the Translation of MicroStation CADD Elements</A></B>.<p>
<p>
<p>
If you are interested in working on the development of this standard contact <B><A HREF="mailto:kbacke@tec.army.mil">Mr. Kevin Backe</A></B>, project team leader.<p>
<p>
<p>
&nbsp; <P>
<B>5. Development of an Accuracy Standard for Facility Mapping.</B>   The FGDC Standards Working Group approved a multi-part accuracy standard and Part 4 will be related to facility mapping.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Standard for facility mapping is being revised to meet the needs of a broader community and a <B><A HREF="facility/fgcs-pt4-y12.wp6">draft version</A></B> is available for comment and review.  <p>

2)  Update on FGDC Activities - M.K. Miles/Kevin Backe (USACE): 
<UL>
 <LI>The Coordination Group met on 9 September.  GIS/LIS is 16-22 November in Denver, CO and if anyone has any FGDC-related information that they would like displayed at the FGDC booth, contact Ms Jennifer Fox at 703-648-5514.  There was an update on activities of the Clearinghouse Working Group.  The Working Group is still recommending a move from WAIS to Isite as the public domain search and query tool for the Clearinghouse.  The Group is pursuing ways to improve searches such as listing the keywords to query on for each agency's Clearinghouse metadata.  The Coordination Group prepared for the FGDC Steering Group meeting which is scheduled for 11 September.  Agenda items for that meeting include NSDI Strategic Plan, FGDC and State Council cooperative efforts, and the recent Hammer Award to the FGDC from Vice-President Gore.
  <LI>The Standards Working Group (SWG) met on 9 September.  The Soils Geographic Data Standard, the Geospatial Positioning Accuracy Standard, the National Standard for Spatial Data Accuracy, the SDTS Point Profile, and the Vegetation Classification and Information Standard are all being reviewed by the SWG prior to going forward for a public review.  The Cadastral Data Content Standard and the Classification of Wetlands and Deep Water Habitats standard are being reviewed by the SWG prior to final FGDC endorsement. 
<LI> Mr. Backe discussed the FGDC Soils Subcommittee=s draft Soils Geographic Data Standard with the FWG. The current draft of this standard tends to be agronomy-based and was intended to contain only surface soils characteristics.  However,  engineering application require the capture of geotechnical characteristics of soils (which apparently is not containing in the FGDC Soils Standard.) 
<LI> Mr. Backe discussed the comments generated by the SWG review of the Geospatial Positioning Accuracy Standard proposal and draft standard.  The SWG directed the Base Cartographic Subcommittee and the Geodetic Control Subcommittee to consider merging the National Standard for Spatial Data Accuracy into the Geospatial Positioning Accuracy Standard prior to sending these two standards out for public review.  The Geospatial Positioning Accuracy Standard is planned to be a multi-part standard addressing many aspects of positional accuracy including a part specifically to support positional accuracy for engineering, construction and facility management applications.
<LI>The SWG discussed and approved holding an additional meeting approximately once a quarter to allow for presentations on FGDC standards projects and proposals.  This will likely be the forum that the four recent proposals from the FWG will be presented to and discussed. 
<LI> Mr. Billy Tolar, FGDC Metadata Coordinator, discussed the pursuit of Astandard@ or recommended metadata implementations for the Framework Working Group and others.  There have been several Federal Agencies and the Framework Working Group that have requested the FGDC Secretariat develop a Astandard@ implementation that could then be queried and accessed by a single software capability.  The use of this Astandard@ implementation by an agency or geospatial application community would be optional and could be considered a guideline or specification. 
<LI> The SWG discussed the draft a set of rules for the subcommittees and working groups to use when opening their meetings to non-Federal participation.  Mr. Fred Broome, Census Bureau and Cultural and Demographic Subcommittee, will finalize these rules per comments from this discussion. 
<LI> ACTION:  Mr. Backe will forward a message about the FWG concerns about the current draft of the FGDC Soils standard to the SWG (Mr. Backe).
</UL>

3)  Proposal for a Utilities Data Content Standard (Kevin Backe, USACE):  
<UL>
<LI> Mr. Backe stated there was no change in status from the last meeting for this project.  The SWG has received the proposal for this project but has not formally reviewed this proposal.  Mr. Backe made another call for FWG participants for a Utilities project team.  To date no participants have volunteered to participate on this project.
Mr. Rik Wiant commented that he was unable to decipher the email message that contained the Utilities database information.  Mr. Backe stated he would send the FWG an email that directed members how to pull the information down from the FWG homepage.   
<LI>Messrs Backe and Miles recommended a six month development period for this standard which began in August 1996.  Ms Davis (FEMA), Mr. Britton (NASA), Mr. Wilson (APWA), and Mr. Ou (FS) expressed an interest in having members of their organization participate in this project. 
<LI> Ms Leslie Godwin (Census Bureau) forwarded comments to Ms Capps on the Utilities, Facility ID, and Environmental Hazards Standards that have been proposed by the FWG.  Since Ms Godwin was unable to attend the meeting, discussion on her comments was deferred until the next meeting. 
<LI> ACTION: Provide Mr. Backe with name(s) and contact information for individuals that will participate on the Utilities Project team to develop the standard (Mr. Britton, Ms. Davis, Mr. Ou, Mr. Wilson). 
<LI>ACTION: Provide specific information about how to access the Utilities database information from the FWG homepage (Mr. Backe).
</UL>

4)  Modeling the Utilities Entity Set (Chip Fleming, Tri-Service Center): 
<UL>
<LI> Mr. Fleming discussed a joint project between the Center and the HQUSACE Information Management Directorate to develop DOD/USACE compliant data models using the IDEF1X modeling language.  The initial project goal has focused on modeling the 12+ entity classes from the TSSDS utilities entity set.  Once these Utilities models are complete they will become part of the USACE Data Repository.  The USACE data encyclopedia=s utilities data elements may also be used to standardize geospatial utilities data model for the DOD Data Element Standardization program.  
<LI> Mr. Fleming stated that there would be a number of changes to the Utilities Entity Set in version 1.6 of the TSSDS (Oct. 96).  These changes will effect this modeling effort and may also effect the FWG Utilities Data Content standard effort.
</UL>

5)  Proposal for Environmental Hazards Content Standard (Kevin Backe, USACE):  
<UL>
<LI> Mr. Backe stated there was no change in status from the last meeting on this project.  The SWG has received the proposal for this project but has not formally reviewed this proposal.  Mr. Backe also made another call for FWG participants on a Environmental Hazards project team.  To date no names have been forwarded to Mr. Backe for volunteers to participate on this project.  Messrs Miles and Backe suggested a nine month development period for this project which began in August 1996.   
<LI> ACTION: Provide Mr. Backe with name(s) and contact information for individuals that will participate on the Environmental Hazards Project team.(FWG members).  
</UL>

6)  FIPS 173/SDTS CADD Profile Proposal and Project Status (Kevin Backe, USACE): 
<UL>
<LI> Mr. Backe stated that the proposal for the development of a Federal Information Processing Standard 173/Spatial Data Transfer Standard (FIPS 173/SDTS) CADD Profile was forwarded to the SWG for consideration.  Mr. Backe briefly discussed the two reports generated by the Center in support of this activity.  These reports  examined the translation of Microstation and AutoCAD CADD elements into SDTS elements and provide a discussion of some of the new elements and changes to SDTS to accommodate a CADD profile.  Mr. Backe also discussed the potential development of a simple vector profile for SDTS and the possible relationship of this activity with a CADD profile. 
</UL>

7)   Next Meeting: 
<UL>
<LI> The next meeting will be 7 October from 1-4 in Room 8222D of the Pulaski Building, 20 Massachusetts Avenue, NW, Washington, DC.

2) Update on FGDC Activities - Penny Capps/Kevin Backe (USACE):
<UL>

<LI>   The Steering Group met on 11 September.   Secretary Babbitt
accepted a Hammer Award for the FGDC.  These awards are given by
Vice-President Gore for demonstrating excellence in reinventing
government, cutting costs, etc.  Each FGDC member will receive
their own hammer award.  In order to continue to strategize on
improved communication between the FGDC and the non-Federal
sector, cooperative projects will be briefed at each FGDC
meeting.  The FGDC members also discussed the NSDI Strategic Plan
and tasked the Coordination Group to provide agencies with a
template to complete that describes their compliance with the
Plan and to schedule presentations on some of these plans at the
next Steering meeting.
 <LI> The Coordination Group and the Standards Working Group (SWG)
met on 6 September.  Activities of these 2 groups were briefed at
the 9 September FWG meeting.
 <LI> The Standards Working Group Proposal Review Team met on 4
October.  The following FWG proposals for standards development
were approved (with minor revisions requested) at this meeting:
Utilities Data Content Standard, Facility ID Standard, and SDTS
CADD Profile.  The review team asked the FWG to better define the
scope of the proposal for an Environmental Hazards Data Content
Standard and resubmit it.  Other proposals for standards
development that were approved are: Thematic Supplement for
Geospatially References Cultural and Demographic Data Metadata;
Address (physical, not email) Content Standard; Digital Elevation
Data; and Digital Orthoimagery. 
<LI>     The Cartographic and the Geodetic Control Subcommittees are
to consider merging the National Standard for Spatial Data
Accuracy into the Geospatial Positioning Accuracy Standard prior
to sending these two standards out for public review.  The
Geospatial Positioning Accuracy Standard is planned to be a multi-
part standard addressing many aspects of positional accuracy
including a part specifically to support positional accuracy for
engineering, construction and facility management applications.
</UL>
<P>
3) Status of FWG Proposals and Next Steps (Kevin Backe, USACE):
<UL>
<LI>  Utilities Content Standard.  The SWG Standards Proposal
Review Team approved this proposal but asked for some minor
revisions, primarily clarification of inter- and intra-city
applications. The reviewers would like to see the scope expanded,
if it will not be too much extra work, to include intercity
utilities.  Mr. Backe will reword this section and return it to
the SWG.  Thus far the development team for this standard
consists of: Mr. Kevin Backe (USACE, coordinator), Mr. Fong Ou
(Forest), Mr. Keith Britton (NASA), Ms Carolyn Davis (FEMA), Mr.
Kern Wilson (APWA), Mr. Dan McHugh (NY, MTA), Mr. Rich Grady
(Applied Geographics), Mr. Bruce Bargmeyer (EPA), and Mr. Jim
Rossberg (ASCE).
<LI>     Mr. McHugh asked if communications were going to be included
in the Utilities Standard and Ms Capps reminded the group that at
a previous meeting, the group decided to exclude communications
from this standard and submit it separately.
<LI>     Mr. Rossberg said that the American Society of Civil
Engineers (ASCE) formed a Utility Committee and they are working
on standards.  He will help this group and the FWG to exchange
information.
<LI>     ACTION: Reword Utilities Content Proposal and return to SWG
(Mr. Backe).
<LI>     ACTION: Revise FWG homepage info on activities and announce
to FWG when this is available (Ms Capps).
<LI>     ACTION: Provide Mr. Backe with name(s) and contact
information for individuals that will participate on the
Utilities Project team to develop the standard, ASAP (FWG
Members).
<LI>     ACTION: Provide an article on the FWG to Mr. Rossberg for
inclusion in the ASCE newsletter (Ms Capps).
<LI>     ACTION: Provide ASCE Utility Standard to Mr. Backe (Mr.
Rossberg).

<LI> Environmental Hazards Content Standard.  The proposal for the
Environmental Hazards Geospatial Data Content Standard was not
approved by the standards review team because the objectives and
scope are unclear, i.e. What environmental hazards are being
standardized? Is the standard limited to only hazardous waste
sites? The standards review team also thought it is  unclear what
involvement regulatory agencies, like  EPA, would have in the
development of the standard.  A project team to rewrite the
proposal consists of:  Mr. Bruce Bargmeyer (EPA, coordinator) and
Mr. Kevin Backe (USACE).
<LI>     The FWG proposed that the project team discuss the following
items: should sound and electromagnetic pollution be considered
(Mr. Rik Wiant, USACE)?  ASCE maps the probability of
hazards/natural disasters per an ASCE standard 795 but they
should not be included in this environmental hazards standard
(Mr. Rossberg), consider EPA requirements (Mr. Backe).
<LI>     ACTION: Edit the proposal, present to FWG for approval, and
resubmit to the SWG (Mr. Bargmeyer).
<LI>     ACTION: Provide Mr. Bargmeyer with name(s) and contact
information for individuals that will participate on the Facility
ID Project team to develop the standard (FWG Members).


<LI> SDTS CADD Profile.  The proposal for this standard was
approved by the SWG Review Team on the condition that minor edits
were made. Mr. Backe will make the requested changes and
resubmit.  Substantial work has already been performed by the Tri-
Service CADD/GIS Technology Center and its contractor(s).  The
FWG does not need to create a project team for this effort but
all members will be provided with reports to review and
opportunities to recommend approaches to profile development.  As
soon as the final reports from the contractor are available they
will be posted on the FWG homepage and distributed at the next
FWG meeting.   ACTION: Edit the proposal and resubmit to the SWG
(Mr. Backe).
<LI>     ACTION: Provide the FWG copies of the SDTS CADD Profile
reports (Ms Capps).

<LI>  Facility ID Standard.  The proposal for this standard was
approved, with a request for some modifications.  Mr. Bargmeyer
will reword the proposal to clarify that the standard will not
assign specific ID numbers to specific facilities, rather it will
assist in linking related place-based facility objects.  He will
also clarify that the standard will not focus on a common list of
facility ids (although this is a result of implementing the
standard) but the development of a schema.  He will also list who
expects to benefit from this standard.  Mr McHugh remarked that
he convinced the NY GIS Steering Committee to accommodate fields
for Ids in its efforts.
<LI>     Thus far the development team for this standard consists of:
Mr. Bargmeyer (EPA, coordinator), Mr. McHugh (NY, MTA), Ms Davis
(FEMA), Mr. Backe (USACE), Mr. Wilson (APWA), Mr. Wiant (USACE),
Ms Dee McFadden-Wallace (GSA), and Mr. Rossberg (ASCE).
<LI>     ACTION: Edit the proposal and resubmit to the SWG (Mr.
Bargmeyer).
<LI>     ACTION: Provide Mr. Bargmeyer with name(s) and contact
information for individuals that will participate on the Facility
ID Project team to develop the standard (FWG Members).
</UL>
<P>
4) Schedule for Future FWG Meetings (Capps): The FWG decided to
try meeting every other month instead of monthly.  The standards
project teams will meet/teleconference/email as needed and report
progress at each FWG meeting.
<P>     

5) Misc.:  GIS/LIS is 16-22 November in Denver, CO.  Contact Ms
Jennifer Fox at 703-648-5514 if you have FGDC-related information
that you would like displayed at the FGDC booth.
<P>
Mr. Wiant asked if agencies were making any progress on
converting to metric.  Mr. McHugh was the only member who
mentioned implementations.  Messrs Wiant and McHugh continued
their discussions after the meeting.
<P>

6) Next Meeting: The next meeting will be 9 December from 1-3 in
Room 8124C of the Pulaski Building, 20 Massachusetts Avenue, NW,
Washington, DC. The Facility ID and Environmental Hazards
Standards Development Teams will meet from 10-12 (same day, same
room) and the Utilities Standard Project Team will meet from 3:15-
4:15 (same day, same room).  Mr. Skip Kiem (MTL Systems, Inc.)
will brief the Mobile Information Distribution and Support
Systems (MIDAS) at the next FWG meeting.

Summary Report


 <H3>Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC)
Facilities Working Group Meeting 
8 April 1996 
 </H3>
 <H4>
Headquarters, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE)
Pulaski Building, Washington, DC
 </H4>


1)  Persons Attending:   <A HREF="./04-08-96.attatch1.html">Attendance roster. </A> <P> 

* See  <A HREF="./04-08-96.attatch2.html">agenda </A> <P>


2)  Update on FGDC Activities - M.K. Miles (USACE): 
 <UL>
	 <LI>The Steering Group will meet on 30 April in the main Interior Building and the primary agenda item is developing state councils and partnerships.
	 <LI>The Coordination Group has a questionnaire on state councils and partnerships to complete by 10 April.  This will be used to guide the discussions at the Steering Group meeting.  Mr. Miles provided a copy of the questionnaire and it is available on the FGDC server for those who are interested.  Any responses received after 10 April will be useful beyond the Steering Group meeting.  If you have data or resources that could help produce a more accurate 2000 Census please contact the Census Bureau reps on the FGDC.  The FGDC Coordination Group may sponsor a workshop on this.  Several members of the Coordination Group are working on the charters for the Subcommittees and Working Groups to ensure that the focus is on national and federal efforts as opposed to agency specific goals.   
	 <LI>The Standards Working Group will have an FGDC-wide meeting on 9 April from 1-4, Room 8222D, HQUSACE, 20 Massachusetts, Avenue, NW, Washington, DC.  The FGDC Subcommittee and Working Group Status Summary Report (It includes recommendations for improving the efficiency of the FGDC) will be discussed.
 </UL>

3)  Development of a Facility/Installation ID Code Standard (Group):
 <UL>
	 <LI>Mr. Ron Niemi (HQUSACE, Center for Public Works) said that the Installations Corporate Information Management (ICIM) definitions for facility, installation, and land tract that he presented at the last meeting will be used unless this FGDC Facilities Group recommends something else.  Ms Heather James from Calibre Systems (an ICIM contractor) gave a presentation on activity models used in the ICIM effort.  She suggested that the FGDC Facilities Working Group might want to use these models to ensure that they are considering all pertinent information in the pursuit of facilities data standards.  Ms James provided handouts for her presentation.
	 <LI>At the last meeting, the group thought that a matrix of agency use of facility and installation terminology would be useful in pursuing a Facility ID Code definition so the Chair prepared a  <A HREF="./04-08-96.attatch3.html">matrix </A> from input received from the members of the group.   Mr. Dave Catlin (EPA) said that EPA does not have the need to catagorize things any broader or more narrow than "facility."  EPA just puts a code on the feature and describes it.  This led to a discussion on Mr. Bruce Bargmeyer's (EPA)  recommendations for developing a Facility ID Code and the Group agreed with the approach, which is: 
	 <UL>
		 <LI>Use a non-intelligent identifier to give anything a unique identity.  In order to prevent agencies from having to redo existing coding schema, associate each facility ID with an  "Identifier Context" that describes existing codes.  Examples are GSA, state, FGDC, etc.  Agencies may choose to migrate to a Federal coding schema eventually but in the meantime we would just ask them to obtain one of our non-intelligent identifiers and equate it/link it with their existing identifier.  The National Institutes of Standards and Technology (NIST) might be interested in maintaining this ID Code register.
		 <LI>Have the ID point to a minimum and mandatory set of data elements about the facility.  Let agencies record any information beyond that mandatory set as well.  Examples are name, address, owner, location, and category of facility.  Category of facility could include the categories we are currently considering, i.e. installation, facility, landtrack, etc.  Mr. Bargmeyer said this would be consistent with ISO and ANSI approaches. The Group still thinks that a Facility ID Code Standard would improve data exchange within the facilities community.
	 </UL>
	 <LI>ACTION: A small group agreed to write a short proposal for a Facility ID Code Standard and present it at the next meeting (Dave Catlin, Bruce Bargmeyer (EPA), Kevin Backe (USACE), David Hammond (Coast Guard).  Bruce Bargmeyer agreed to take the lead on this and to contact Mr. Dan McHugh and Mr. Bruce Spear directly for input (these 2 group members had specific recommendations in the past about the ID Code Standard).  Send your ideas to Bruce Bargmeyer (Facility Working Group).
 </UL>

4)  Draft DoD Directive for EO 12906 Compliance (Penny Capps, HQUSACE):
 <UL>
	 <LI>Members of the Tri-Service CADD/GIS Technology Center Executive Working Group have drafted a DoD Directive to provide guidance on complying with EO 12906.  The purposes are to:
	 <UL>
		 <LI> Ensure consistent implementation within DoD
		 <LI> List those data sets that, per the Secretary of Defense, will have restricted release to the public because of threats to national security
		 <LI> Define the process for obtaining a waiver from the Secretary of Defense for complying with EO 12906.
	 </UL>
The Chair asked for advice from the Facilities Working Group on developing a list of data themes related to a facility that should have restricted release to the public, i.e. power grids, weapons storage sheds, etc.  If the data sets are already restricted, provide the public law or act that states this. The Chair will provide a copy of this directive to the Facilities Working Group once it has been coordinated with the Defense Mapping Agency and other DoD agencies.
	 <LI>ACTION: Recommend to the chair any facility-related data themes that should be waived from EO 12906 compliance and cite any public laws or acts that exist that restrict release of data to the public (Facilities Working Group).
 </UL>	




5)  Proposal of Some Tri-Service Spatial Data Standards (TSSDS) Entity Classes as FGDC Facilities Working Group Standards (Miles):
 <UL>
	 <LI>At the last meeting the Facilities Group agreed to review the TSSDS Utilities, Buildings, Improvements, Communications, and Environmental Hazards entity classes and recommend changes or recommend that these sections be initiated into the FGDC standards development process.  Some members stated that had reviewed portions of some of these entities.  Mr. Miles suggested that we might make more progress if we start with one entity such as Utilities.
	 <LI>ACTION: Review the TSSDS Utilities entity.  Be prepared to propose any changes required to meet your agency needs or to propose the TSSDS Utility entity as is, as an FGDC standard. (GROUP).  
 </UL>

6)  Proposal of the TSSDS Structure as an FGDC Standard - (Miles/Ed Riegelmann, Tri-Service CADD/GIS Technology Center):
 <UL>
	 <LI>Mr. Miles distributed the proposal that went forward to the FGDC Standards Working Group on adopting the TSSDS structure.  This proposal was revised from the last version that the Facilities Working agreed on.  The Standards Working Group said it was more appropriate for USACE to be the proposing FGDC agency and the Standards Working Group would use the Tri-Service Center as a subcontractor if approved by the FGDC.  The focus of the proposal is to use the TSSDS structure and the interactive approach (Microsoft Access) as a tool to assist FGDC subcommittees in developing data content standards in a consistent format and to integrate these standards on one CD for distribution to the public.  Mr. Riegelmann gave a demo of this interactive tool and structure and said he would be giving the same demo at the FGDC-wide meeting on 9 April.
 </UL>

7) Misc:
 <UL>
	 <LI>The American Planning Association (APA) conference is 13-17 April in Kissimmee, FL and the first APA Federal Planning Division (FPD) conference will be held 17-19 April in Kissimmee.  The Facilities Working Group Alternate Chair will give a presentation on the FGDC, Facilities Working Group, and EO 12906 at the FPD conference.
 </UL>

8)  Next Meetings:
 <UL>
	 <LI>The next three meetings will be 13 May, 17 June, and 15 July from 1-4 in Room 8222D of the Pulaski Building, 20 Massachusetts Avenue, NW, Washington, DC.

2)  Update on FGDC Activities - M.K. Miles (USACE): 
<UL>
<LI>The Steering Group  met on 12 June.  Secretary Babbitt was the keynote speaker at the May ESRI Users Conference and he voiced his support of the use of GIS and other geospatial data related technologies.  Ms Nancy Tosta is leaving the FGDC to work for the Pugent Sound Regional Council. 
Mr.  Mark Schaffer, the Assistant Deputy Undersecretary for Water Resources within DOI, asked that FGDC Steering Group members contact him with discussion items, recommendations on FGDC focus, etc.  The DOI budget examiner at the Office of Management and Budget, Mr. Bruce Baird,  suggested being prepared to defend GIS and geospatial data related costs within your agency budgets, as the Departments of Interior and Agriculture are being questioned on the Hill.  
<LI>The Coordination Group held a meeting on 11 June.  The FGDC has recognized approximately 11 State NSDI coordinating councils and hopes to conduct some FGDC Coordination Group meetings outside of Washington, DC so that more state reps can participate.  The Competitive Cooperative Agreements Program (CCAP) winners for FY97 have been selected but not notified.  This program is entering its third year and awards approximately $1M to non-Federal agencies to develop the NSDI.  The FGDC has 1 more month to review the Cadastral Content Standard.  It will not go out for another public review.  
<LI>The Standards Working Group (SWG) held a meeting on 11 June.  The Tri-Service CADD/GIS Technology Center is working on the prototype of the integrated FGDC standards model. The Center will integrate the appropriate parts of the following data content and classification standards: Base Carto (DLG-E), Vegetation, Cadastral, and Wetlands.  Some large scale features of the TSSDS will also be included to demonstrate the ability of the tool to flag potential overlaps.  Some agencies wanted to include non-spatial information and the decision was made to stick with geospatial data only for the prototype. 
<UL>
<LI>During the 17 June Facilities Working Group meeting, Mr Bargmeyer (EPA) commented that the TSSDS and X3L8 efforts need to be coordinated at some point in the future.  He stated that the efforts seem compatible.
</UL>
</UL>


3)  Draft Proposal of Utilities Content Standard (Penny Capps, USACE and Harold Smith, Tri-Service CADD/GIS Technology Center):
<UL>
<LI>Ms Capps presented the <A HREF="./06-17-96.attatch3.html">draft proposal</A> for an FGDC Utilities Data Content Standard that Mr. Kevin Backe (USACE) wrote.  She explained that this proposal will be submitted to the FGDC Standards Working Group to indicate the intent to develop a standard.  This enables the Standards Working Group to track the standards that are being developed, avoid duplicative standards development efforts, etc.  Mr. Rik Wiant (USACE) asked that the scope be modified to include a list or description of the utilities addressed by the standard.  Ms Capps said that she will edit the proposal as requested in the hopes of submitting it to the FGDC Standards Group at their 9 July meeting.  If she receives conflicting requests for edits she will bring the proposal back to the next Facilities meeting to resolve them before submitting to the Standards Group.
<LI>Mr. Smith briefed the TSSDS Utilities entity set using an interactive Microsoft Access application.  He explained that we should remove the implementation specific content (coverage name, concatenated names, etc.) prior to submitting the standard to the Standards Working Group.  This information is supplied so that the Army, Navy, Air Force installations can immediately implement the TSSDS in ARC/INFO, MGE, Microstation, and AutoCAD environments.  Implementation information can be provided as a bonus or option but not as a Federal standard.  Mr. Wiant asked if cable TV and other communication features are included in the TSSDS entity set.  Mr. Smith said that information is under the Communications entity.  Ms Carolyn Davis (FEMA) asked if this entity set includes oil refineries.  Mr. Smith said it does not and there are a few other such features that are not included in utilities but probably could be included in the TSSDS Buildings entity set.  He suspects that the user is probably only interested in the location or footprint of the refinery.  Mr. Smith said that to facilitate the review of the Utilities entity set he will provide the IDEF Model of the TSSDS to the Facilities Working Group.  This FIPS model will illustrate which features are included in which entity set, etc.  Captain Brodt (NIH) stated that since the current content is fairly complete and developed by subject matter experts he probably can not offer any additional information to incorporate.  However, he believes his role will be in the adjudication of comments.
<UL>
<LI>ACTION: Submit comments on the draft proposal to Ms Capps by 5 July (Facilities Working Group).
<LI>ACTION: Modify the proposal (Ms Capps) and submit at the 9 July Standards Working Group meeting (Mr. Backe).	
<LI>ACTION: Review the Utilities Entity Set and provide comments to Mr. Smith or bring to next meeting (Facilities Working Group).
<LI>ACTION: Remove the implementation specific content from the Utilities entity set and bring this version (digital and paper) to the 15 July Facilities Working Group meeting (Harold Smith).
<LI>ACTION: Provide the group with the IDEF model of the TSSDS at an August or September meeting (Harold Smith). 
</UL>
</UL>



4)  Draft Proposal for Environmental Hazards Content Standard (Penny Capps, USACE and Harold Smith Tri-Service CADD/GIS Technology Center):
<UL>
<LI>Ms Capps presented the <A HREF="./06-17-96.attatch4.html">draft proposal</A> for an FGDC Environmental Hazards Data Content Standard that Mr. Kevin Backe (USACE) wrote.  Several people commented that the Scope needs to be more descriptive and Mr. Dave Catlin (EPA) said he would provide comments on this.  Ms Capps said that she will edit the proposal as requested in the hopes of submitting it to the FGDC Standards Group at their 9 July meeting.  If she receives conflicting requests for edits she will bring the proposal back to the next Facilities meeting to resolve them before submitting to the Standards Group.
<LI>The Environmental Hazards Entity Set was briefed in great detail at the last meeting so there were not many questions.  Mr. Smith said that TSSDS 1.6 should be available in October and will include a much more robust environmental hazards entity set than the current version 1.4 (he is still accepting comments on 1.4).  He would like to wait until version 1.6 is complete and then prepare an implementation-free copy for review.  Otherwise he would remove this info from 1.4 and have to do it again 2 months from now for version 1.6.   Mr. Bruce Bargmeyer (EPA) said this was okay with him because it would take a couple of months to schedule a review of this content standard.  Mr. Al Lew (NASA) said this would give the group time to work through the standards development process on the utilities entity set.  Mr. Lew also commented that the National Institute of Building Sciences (NIBS) has some environmental work groups and we should notify them of our standards development plans.

<LI>ACTION: Submit comments on the draft proposal to Ms Capps by 5 July (Facilities Working Group).
<LI>ACTION: Modify the proposal (Ms Capps) and submit at the 9 July Standards Working Group meeting (Mr. Backe).
<LI>ACTION: Review the Environmental Hazards Entity Set and provide comments to Mr. Smith or bring to next meeting (Facilities Working Group).
<LI>ACTION: Remove the implementation specific content from the version 1.6 Environmental Hazards entity set and provide to the Facilities Working Group at an October/November meeting (Harold Smith).
<LI>ACTION: Provide the group with the IDEF model of the TSSDS at an August/September meeting (Harold Smith). 
<LI>ACTION: Coordinate with NIBS on development of this standard (Ms Capps).
</UL>

5)  Development of a Unique Identification Number (UIN) Standard for Facilities (Bruce Bargmeyer, EPA):
<UL>
<LI>Mr. Bargmeyer said that he has not received any comments on the UIN paper he presented at the last meeting.  He volunteered to prepare a proposal on this to submit to the FGDC Standards Working Group.  Mr. Bargmeyer distributed a list of data elements that EPA tracks for each facility.  He asked that the group provide him comments or bring comments to the next meeting on modifications to this list.  Ms Capps commented that some elements were data elements and some were metadata elements.  Mr. Bargmeyer said this needs to be addressed. Ms Capps said she would invite Mr. Domaratz, FGDC Project Manager for Framework, to a future meeting so that he could discuss the Framework concept for UINs (Mr. Domaratz has met with the Facilities Group on this topic but there have been a lot of new developments since that time).  We will also need to resurrect our discussions on some sort of typing structure (facility, installation, land tract, network, etc.) so that people know multiple facilities can be associated with an installation, etc.  
<LI>ACTION: Prepare a proposal to submit to the FGDC Standards Working Group for a Unique Identification Number Standard for Facilities.  Provide it at the 15 July Facilities meeting for review (Mr. Bargmeyer).
<LI>ACTION: Send comments on the UIN Standard Paper to Mr. Bargmeyer  (Facilities Working Group).  
<LI>ACTION: Provide comments to Mr. Bargmeyer on the Data Elements to track for facilities or bring them to the next meeting (Facilities Working Group).  
</UL>

5)  Misc.:   
<UL>
<LI>Mr. Wiant asked if anyone could explain the relationship between the FGDC Metadata Standard and the Government Information Locator Service (GILS).  Ms Capps explained that the GILS standard does accommodate geospatial data and the Metadata Standard adopted those elements and expanded on them.  So the 2 standards are in harmony.  <A HREF="mailto:btolar@usgs.gov">Mr. Billy Tolar</A> is the project manager for metadata.
</UL> 

6)   Next Meeting: 
<UL>
<LI>The next meeting will be 15 July from 1-4 in Room 8222D of the Pulaski Building, 20 Massachusetts Avenue, NW, Washington, DC.

* See <A HREF="./05-13-96.attatch2.html">agenda. </A> <P>


2)  Update on FGDC Activities - M.K. Miles (USACE): 
<UL>
<LI>The Steering Group  met on 30 April and the primary agenda item was developing state councils and partnerships.
<LI>The Coordination Group held a meeting on 9 April and discussed the 1996 Competitive Cooperative Agreement Program (CCAP). A Land Cover Working Group was approved for a one year trial period.
<LI>The Standards Working Group (SWG) held an FGDC-wide meeting on 9 April. 
<UL>
<LI>Ms Denise Perreca  discussed the recommendations from the report on activities of the FGDC Subcommittees and Working Groups.  
<LI>Mr. Richard Hogan (C/SWG) made a presentation on the SDTS/FIPS 173 logical data model and suggested that FGDC Subcommittees and Working Groups use this model.  
<LI>Mr. Miles briefed a proposal that the Tri-Service Spatial Data Standards (TSSDS) structure and database development tool be adopted as an FGDC standard.  
<LI>Mr. Ed Riegelmann (Tri-Service Center) made a presentation on the TSSDS and a strawman of an FGDC version.  This tool uses an interactive approach (Microsoft Access) and would support query and analysis of overlapping standards, and would enable distribution of FGDC standards in a consistent and integrated format on one CD.
</UL>
<LI>At the 14 May meeting of the SWG, a prototype phase of the proposal was approved.  The Center will integrate the appropriate parts of the following data content and classification standards:
<UL>
<LI>Base Carto (DLG-E)
<LI>Vegetation
<LI>Cadastral
<LI>Wetlands
</UL>
Some large scale features of the TSSDS will also be included to demonstrate the ability of the tool to flag potential overlaps.
</UL>

3)  Proposal of Utilities and Environmental Hazards Entities of the TSSDS as Facilities Working Group Standards (Harold Smith and Bobby Carpenter, Tri-Service Center/Kevin Backe USACE):
<UL>
<LI>At the last meeting the Facilities Working Group agreed to review the TSSDS Utilities, Buildings, Improvements, Communications, and Environmental Hazards entity classes and recommend changes or recommend that these sections be initiated into the FGDC standards development process.  Some members had reviewed portions of some of these entities.  Mr. Miles suggested that we might make more progress if we start with one entity such as Utilities.
<LI>Mr. Backe provided an overview of a proposal to develop FGDC Utilities and Environmental Hazards Data Content Standards.  Mr. Backe recommended that the Facilities Working Group establish project teams to develop these standards.  Mr. Backe also discussed the steps to develop an FGDC standard (defined in the FGDC Standards Reference Model).  
<LI>Mr. Carpenter provided an overview of the TSSDS and a presentation on the environmental hazards entities.  
<LI>Mr. Smith briefed the Utilities entities.   
<LI>ACTION:  Draft proposals for an FGDC Utilities and Environmental Hazards Data Content Standards.  Send out a request for participants for the Utilities and Environmental Hazards project teams (Kevin Backe).
</UL>

4)  Development of a Unique Identification Number (UIN) Standard for Facilities (Bruce Bargmeyer, EPA):
<UL>
<LI>At the last meeting, a small group agreed to write a proposal for a Facility UIN Standard.  Mr. Bargmeyer provide copies of the subject draft proposal at the meeting for review and comment.   He also provided the group an overview of the subject proposal.  Mr. Bargmeyer recommended the following approach be taken:
<UL>
<LI>assign a UIN that is non-intelligent to geospatial objects of interest
<LI>associate this UIN with other agency/organization identifiers by linking these existing identifier (e.g., GSA, DOD, Army, Navy, Air Force identifiers) to this UIN	
<LI>associate the UIN with a core set of identifying information (e.g., proper name, lat/lon, type of facility) which potentially links to geospatial information in other databases.  
</UL>
<LI>ACTION: Send comments to Mr. Bargmeyer for incorporation into the proposal and be prepared to continue discussions at next meeting (All Facilities Working Group Members).  
</UL>

5)  Misc.:
<UL>
<LI>Group members asked for a reminder about the meeting, 1 week in advance.
<LI>ACTION: Email/fax members a reminder about the meetings (Penny Capps).
</UL>

6)  Next Meetings:
<UL>
	<LI>The next meetings will be 17 June and 15 July from 1-4 in Room 8222D of the Pulaski Building, 20 Massachusetts Avenue, NW, Washington, DC.

Summary Report


 <H3>Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC)
Facilities Working Group Meeting 
14 February 1996 
 </H3>
 <H4>
Headquarters, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) <BR>
Pulaski Building, Washington, DC
 </H4>


1)  Persons Attending:   <A HREF="./02-14-96.attatch1.html">Attendance roster </A> <P>

* See  <A HREF="./02-14-96.attatch2.html">agenda </A> <P>


2)  Update on FGDC Activities - Penny Capps (USACE): 
 <UL>
	 <LI>The FGDC Coordination Group decided that the Facilities Working Group has been moved from ad hoc status to permanent status.
	 <LI>The FGDC Coordination Group agreed to form an ad hoc group to address standards for Land Cover.
	 <LI>The American Planning Association briefed the Coordination Group on their Federally funded efforts to create data standards for Land Use.
	 <LI>The Historical Working Group will have a meeting on March 7 to revitalize itself.
	 <LI>Lots of activity regarding the Metadata Standard.  The FGDC funded the Mitre Corporation to evaluate software that supposedly creates FGDC compliant Metadata Standard.  They will prepare a report on this by mid-year.  The International Standards Organization (ISO) is investigating the FGDC Metadata Standard as an ISO standard.  There will be a technical meeting in Denver during the week of 19 Feb to discuss potential revisions to the Metadata Standard, definition of a "core" set of elements,  and other things that need to happen to make the standard more useable.
	 <LI>The Clearinghouse Working Group has a paper on its FGDC Homepage titled, "What it Means to be a Clearinghouse Node."  Comments were due to the FGDC Clearinghouse Group by 20 Feb.
	 <LI>Contractors have delivered their final version of the FGDC Subcommittee and Working Group Status Summary Report (It includes recommendations for improving the efficiency of the FGDC). This was distributed at the meeting and is available from the FGDC Standards Working Group Homepage.  The Standards Working Group will correct any mistakes but will not be sending this back to the contractor for other revisions.  The Standards Working Group is trying to reschedule the FGDC-wide meeting to discuss this report for 9 April from 1-4, Room 8222D, HQUSACE, 20 Massachusetts, Avenue, NW, Washington, DC.
	 <UL>
		 <LI>ACTION: Review the report, especially references to the Facilities Working Group, and make sure the information is correct.  As this is already available on the Web, provide comments to Facilities Working Group Chair immediately (Group).
	 </UL>
	 <LI>Mr. Bruce Spear (Bureau of Transportation Statistics) said that as chair of the Ground Transportation Subcommittee he has been revising the charter for that group and has addressed the relationship between the Facilities Working Group and the Ground Transportation Subcommittee.  He stated that his subcommittee is interested in transportation features and connectivity of these features but not necessarily in the representation of those features (points, lines, polygons).  He recognized the Facilities Working Group as having responsibility for the detailed engineering and facility related information about certain transportation features.  He hopes that both groups can work together to collapse the detailed Facilities information into a Transportation/centerline type of product and to overlay the Transportation network data on the Facilities maps.  The Facilities Working Group agreed with this relationship.
 </UL>

3)  Proposal of TSSDS as an FGDC Facilities Working Group Standard - Kevin Backe (USACE):
 <UL>
	 <LI> Mr. Backe distributed a draft  <A HREF="./02-14-96.attatch3.html">proposal </A> for the Tri-Service Spatial Data Standards (TSSDS) to be accepted as an FGDC standard.  The proposal suggests that the TSSDS be the integrator of all FGDC standards plus include additional larger-scale information that the facilities community is interested in.  The TSSDS:
	 <UL>
		 <LI>Would be reformatted to remove agency specific information
		 <LI>Would emphasize that although there are implementations of this standard available for the vendor platforms used by the Tri-Service community, that this is not an FGDC endorsement of those platforms
		 <LI>Would provide a structure for all FGDC standards and all geospatial data of various resolutions to be bundled into one standard for use by federal, local, state, academic, and private agencies.
	 </UL>
	The Tri-Service Center would be used to accomplish this work and to create a CD.  The subcommittees and working groups remain the owners of their standards and they, not the Center, would be responsible for resolving problems between standards.  The Group agreed with the proposal concept and will provide comments on the content.
	 <LI>ACTION:   Provide comments to Mr. Backe by 1 March (Group).
 </UL>


4)  Definition of Facility/Installation - (Group):
 <UL>  
	 <LI>The Group decided that it needed firm definitions of Facility and Installation in order to promulgate an ID Code Standard on this type of data.  Some  <A HREF="./02-14-96.attatch4.html">definitions </A> the Group had considered were distributed.  Mr. Ron Niemi (USACE) said that the DoD is close to making a decision on these definitions for inclusion in the Defense Data Dictionary System (DDDS).  Mr. Niemi would like to take a Facilities Working Group proposal to the DoD meetings so that any definitions put in the DDDS would be useable by the rest of the Federal Government.  He distributed candidate definitions (Attachment 5) and said DoD found the FIPS definition of Facility inadequate and there is no FIPS definition of an Installation.  The discussion was overcome by the discussion on the development of an ID Code Standard, which is why the group thought it needed succinct definitions in the first place.  
	 <LI>ACTION: Everyone be prepared to continue this discussion, i.e. bring your ideas on installation and facility definitions.
 </UL>

5)  Development of a Facility/Installation ID Code Standard (Group): 
 <UL>
	 <LI>The Group is still struggling with this plan.  Mr. Spear expressed concern that there were already some accepted Facility codes in place for things like airports and he thought that agencies that maintain these codes would not be willing to tack on additional codes to fit into some grand coding registry.  Mr. Dan McHugh (NY City Transit) sited instances where he would find these codes useful, i.e. locating and accessing facility data, cross referencing data sets, etc.  This discussion went on for quite some time with no resolution.  Members who had worked on the subgroup to define this effort were not at the meeting so the group decided to readdress the problem at the next meeting.
	 <LI>ACTION: Be prepared to defend your position on this topic, we need to reach some consensus (Group)!
 </UL>

6)  Status of SDTS CADD Profile and Tri-Service Spatial Data Standards :
 <UL>
	 <LI>Mr. Riegelmann has a report on CADD elements needed for an SDTS CADD Profile and will provide it to interested Facility Working Group members..
	 <LI>ACTION: Tell Mr. Riegelmann you want to review this report (Group).
 </UL>

7)  Upcoming Conferences: 
 <UL>
	 <LI>The AM/FM International Conference is 24-27 March in Seattle, WA.  
	 <LI>The American Planning Association (APA) conference is 13-17 April in Kissimmee, FL and the first APA Federal Planning Division (FPD) conference will be held 17-19 April in Kissimmee.
	 <UL>
		 <LI>The Facilities Working Group Chair will give a presentation on the FGDC, Facilities Working Group, and EO 12906 at the FPD conference.
	 </UL>
 </UL>

8)  Next Meeting: 
 <UL>
	 <LI>The next meeting will be 11 March from 1-4 in room 7233 of the Pulaski Building, 20 Massachusetts Avenue, NW, Washington, DC.  
	 <LI>The Group might be willing to set the year's meetings for certain Monday afternoons from 1-4 but did not have time to resolve this at the meeting.
	 <LI>ACTION: Be prepared to discuss: 
	 <UL>
		 <LI>Definition of facility and installation
		 <LI>Development of an facility/installation ID Code Standard
		 <LI>TSSDS as an FGDC standard
		 <LI>Calendar for the year (Group).

1)  Persons Attending:  <A HREF="./07-15-96.attatch1.html">Attendance roster.</A> <P>  
 
* See <A HREF="./07-15-96.attatch2.html">agenda. </A> <P> 
 
 
2)  Update on FGDC Activities - Penny Capps/Kevin Backe (USACE):  
<UL>
<LI>The Coordination Group met on 9 July.  If you would like a copy of the entire FGDC membership directory contact Ms Mickey Kilpatrick at 703-648-4636 (COMM), 703-648-5725 (FAX), or mkilpatr@usgs.gov (Internet).  She can provide you a custom sorted membership list by agency, subcommittee, etc. 
<LI>Mr. Peter Lyttle, with the USGS Office of Outreach, has agreed to write a monthly column for Geotimes Magazine featuring maps published by the Federal Government.  These are Ageologic@ maps in the very broadest use of the term, i.e. not just geology but surveying, imagery, etc.   
<LI>The FGDC Secretariat will send a letter to State Geospatial Data Councils requesting their participation in data standards development.  The letter will ask them to contact the subcommittee or working group chairs for information about particular standards.  This might assist the Facilities Working Group in obtaining a broader review of its utilities, environmental, and unique feature ID standards. 
<LI>There will be another Framework FY96 Pilot Project Managers meeting in Baltimore this month.  They will continue their discussions on experiences in developing some aspect of the Framework.  This week a team of Feds is reviewing proposals for FY97 Framework Projects.  The FGDC is beginning discussions on what the Federal Government should do next in order to develop the Framework, i.e. let each agency do its own thing, develop a standard approach, etc. 
<LI>The Standards Working Group (SWG) met on 9 July. The Cadastral Subcommittee is making its final changes on the Cadastral Standard and then it will be presented to the Coordination and Steering Groups for final approval.  Then it will be a Federal Standard!  It is posted on the FGDC public ftp site. 
<LI>The Geodetic Control Subcommittee has asked for reviewers for the Geospatial Positioning Accuracy Standard.  This is available in the Geodetic directory on the Standards Working Group ftp site.  There are supposed to be 4 parts to this standard and accuracy standards for large scale facility mapping is one of those sections. 
<LI>The Soils Subcommittee revised the Soils Standard based on comments and it needs to be reviewed again by the Standards Group before it goes out for public review.  Check the Soil directory of the Standards Working Group page.  The first version was agronomy based and the Tri-Service CADD/GIS Technology Center submitted a request for geotechnical and engineering parameters to be added.  Mr. Dan McHugh (NY City MTA) said that this is an important revision for his geospatial data community. 
<LI>The Vegetation Standard is out for public review and is posted on the FGDC public ftp site. 
<LI>The Wetlands Standard will be sent to the Standards Working Group on 1 August for a review before final endorsement. 
<LI>Mr. Billy Tolar, Metadata Standard Manager, discussed the pursuit of metadata profiles.  These profiles would be optional and would provide a template for specific data communities to follow if so desired.  These profiles would augment the Metadata Standard. 
<LI>Mr. Fred Broome, Census Bureau and Cultural and Demographic Subcommittee, is establishing a group to draft a set of rules for the subcommittees and working groups to use when opening their meetings to non-Federal participation.  The Facilities Working Group has not had any issues with opening its meetings but some subcommittees are concerned about voting, possible overwhelming attendance, etc. 
</UL> 

3)  Proposal for a Utilities Data Content Standard (Kevin Backe, USACE):
<UL>
<LI> Mr. Backe modified the Tri-Service Spatial Data Standards (TSSDS) Utility entity set for consideration as a Federal standard.  He removed Tri-Service specific information as well as implementation specific information.  He provided an example of this version in paper form and will provide a digital version to those interested.  Ms Capps will also make the electronic version available on the Facilities Working Group page.  Mr. Backe is looking for volunteers to continue developing the standard. <BR>
<LI>The <A HREF="./07-15-96.attatch3.html">proposal</A> for an FGDC Utilities Data Content Standard was approved by the Facilities Working Group and will be submitted to the Standards Working Group.  This signifies the intent to develop a standard.  <BR>
<LI>Mr. Tony Joyce (NAVFAC) expressed concern that we do not have enough variety of people developing the standard, specifically utility companies.  Ms Capps explained that the Facilities Working Group meetings are announced on the World Wide Web and in the Federal Register so that anyone may attend.  Although there has been limited non-Federal attendance at the meetings, Ms Capps said that she receives email and phone calls from non-Federal members who are on the distribution list but are not able to attend the meetings.  They are interested in the Utilities Standard and plan to keep abreast of its development.  There is always room for improving our coordination and Ms Capps is willing to distribute information to any person or agency.    <BR>
<LI>Mr. Fong Ou (Forest Service) provided a list of entities that he would like added to the Draft Utility Standard.  Mr. Backe asked that anyone requesting entities be added also provide the definitions of those entities, as well as associated attributes and domains.<BR>
<LI>ACTION: Submit the Proposal for a Utilities Data Content Standard to the Standards Working Group (Mr. M.K. Miles).   
<LI>ACTION: Provide electronic copies of the draft standard to those interested (Mr. Kevin Backe). 
<LI>ACTION: Serve the electronic version of the draft standard on the Facilities Working Group Page (Ms Penny Capps). 
<LI>ACTION: Inform Mr. Backe if you would like to be on the Utilities Project team to develop the standard (Facilities Working Group Members).  
<LI>ACTION: Provide Ms Capps with individuals or agencies that you would like added to the distribution list (Facilities Working Group Members). 
<LI>ACTION: Provide Mr. Backe with specific information about the entities to be added (Mr. Ou). 
<LI>ACTION: Provide IDEF Model of Utilities Standard at next meeting (Mr. Harold Smith). 
</UL>
4)  Proposal for Environmental Hazards Content Standard (Penny Capps, USACE):
<UL>
<LI>Ms Capps presented the revised <A HREF="./07-15-96.attatch4.html">proposal</A> for an FGDC Environmental Hazards Data Content Standard.  Mr Joyce was concerned that we would duplicate the efforts of the Chemical Abstract Society and suggested rewriting the proposal to say that we would not duplicate the efforts of other groups.  Mr. Backe pointed out that this was a given - that the FGDC will not duplicate existing standards efforts.  He also stated that since we do not know the exact overlap between our proposed standard and the Chemical Abstract Society Standard that we not limit ourselves in our proposal.  Mr. Ed Racht (USACE) recommended that we remember to coordinate with the Chemical Abstract Society as we pursue development of this standard.  We can always modify the proposal as we get further along in the project.  The proposal was approved by the Facilities Working Group and will be submitted to the Standards Working Group.  This signifies the intent to develop a standard. 
<LI>The TSSDS Environmental Hazards Entity will be expanded tremendously in version 1.6, due out in the 2 months.  Mr. Backe will provide a stripped down version of that for submittal to the Facilities Working Group as a draft Environmental Hazards Standard.  
<LI>ACTION: Submit the Proposal for a Environmental Hazards Data Content Standard to the Standards Working Group (Mr. M.K. Miles).   
</UL>

5) Geographic Army Reserve Information System (GARIS) Demo (Bill Gavazzi, USACE):
<UL>
<LI> Mr. Gavazzi demonstrated GARIS, which he developed to manage complex facility and environmental information at Army Reserve facilities.  GARIS operates in the Microstation, ORACLE, Windows NT environment and it also uses the TSSDS.  The Army Reserve has 10 Regional Support Commands (which correspond to the EPA and FEMA regions) with approximately 1400 facilities.  Mr. Gavazzi has established a process to accept the facility paper maps and drawings, rasterize and vectorize them, and import them into GARIS.  There were a lot of questions on GARIS for Mr. Gavazzi and comments that it would be nice to have more technology demos at our meetings. 
</UL> 

6)  Proposal for a Facility ID Data Standard (Bruce Bargmeyer, EPA):
<UL>
<LI>Mr. Bargmeyer presented a proposal for the development of a Facility ID Standard.  The group asked that he make several modifications and he has done this so quickly that the modified version is <A HREF="./07-15-96.attatch5.html">attached</A>.  There was a lot of discussion about the definition of facility, guidelines on a hierarchy of components, etc. and Ms Capps reminded the group that the proposal just signifies the intent to develop a standard, not that all the technical details have been worked out.  The group said that they would like a little more time to review the proposal before submitting to the Standards Working Group.  If Ms Capps does not receive comments by 2 August she will assume the Chair can submit this standard. 
<LI>Mr. Bargmeyer asked for volunteers to work on the proposal and Messrs Kevin Backe and Ron Niemi (USACE), Mr. Dan McHugh (NY City MTA), Ms Carolyn Davis (FEMA), and Ms Dee McFadden-Wallace (GSA) volunteered.  Ms Davis recommended that everyone get their existing ID Code information together in preparation for the first meeting. 
<LI>Mr. Joyce recommended that since we have made some progress on our pursuit of a Feature ID Standard we should get the FGDC Framework Project Manager to our next meeting. 
<LI>ACTION: Review  the Proposal for a Facility ID Data Standard and provide comments to Ms Capps by 2 August (Facilities Working Group). 
<LI>ACTION: If no comments are received by 2 August or comments received by 2 August are easily incorporated, submit the Proposal for a Facility ID Standard to the Standards Working Group (Mr. M.K. Miles).   
<LI>ACTION: Tell Mr. Bargmeyer if you volunteer to be on the project team to develop the standard and get your existing ID Code info together (Facilities Working Group). 
<LI>ACTION: Invite Mr. Mike Domaratz, FGDC Framework Manager, to the next meeting (Ms Penny Capps). 
</UL> 
 
7)   Next Meeting:
<UL>
	<LI>The next meeting will be 9 September from 1-4 in Room 8222D of the Pulaski Building, 20 Massachusetts Avenue, NW, Washington, DC.

Summary Report

 <H3>Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC)
Facilities Working Group Meeting 
21 December 1995 
 </H3>
 <H4>
Headquarters, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) <BR>
Pulaski Building, Washington, DC
 </H4>

1)  Persons Attending:   <A HREF="./12-21-95.attatch1.html>Attendance roster </A>  <P>

* See attached  <A HREF="12-21-95.attatch2.html>agenda  </A>
 <P>


2)  Update on FGDC Activities - M.K. Miles, Penny Capps (USACE): 
 <UL>   
	 <LI>There will be an FGDC-wide meeting on 16 January from 1-4 at the USGS Auditorium in Reston, VA to discuss the FGDC Subcommittee and Working Group Status Summary Report (this was prepared by several contractors and distributed at several Facilities Working Group meetings). * Due to the furlough and inclement weather, this meeting was cancelled and has not been rescheduled.
	 <LI>The next FGDC Steering Group meeting will be held 9 January from 10-12 at the Main Department of Interior building.
	 <LI>The FGDC has new color coordinated folders and fact sheets that are useful when briefing coworkers on the FGDC.  You can obtain these at no charge by calling Ms Jennifer Snyder at 703-648-5514.
 </UL>

3)  Miscellaneous Facility Working Group Business - Penny Capps (USACE): <BR>
 <UL>
	 <LI>Minutes are available on the USACE Clearinghouse node (http://corps_geo1.usace.army.mil/FGDC/welcome.html)  and are linked to the FGDC homepage.  The Facilities Working Group membership list is on the server, with hot E-mail addresses of the members.  
	 <UL>
		 <LI>ACTION:  If you have not done so already, please E-mail, phone, or fax the chair your preference for either continuing to receive hardcopy minutes via postal mail or accessing them on the Facilities Working Group homepage (Facilities Working Group).
	 </UL>

	 <LI>Ms Capps attended GIS/LIS '95 in Nashville, TN in November and as a result added a few more non-Federal members to the Facilities Working Group.

	 <LI>Ms Capps had not completed a proposal to the FGDC for a Facility ID Standard.
	 <UL>

		 <LI>ACTION: Prepare a straw man based on the new Installation and Facility concept discussed at the meeting and present at the next meeting (Capps).
	 </UL>

	 <LI>The effort of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the U.S. Army Construction Engineering and Research Laboratory (CERL) to develop a facility ID code standard is based on existing Army codes.  The 2 agencies have had to map between a lot of existing codes and are interested in the Facilities Working Group proposal to develop a standard.
	
	 <LI>Ms Capps distributed draft copies of,  FGDC Facilities Working Group  <A HREF="./12-21-95.attatch3.html>1995 Accomplishments </A> and  FGDC Facilities Working Group  <A HREF="./12-21-95.attatch5.html">1996 Work Plan </A>.
	 <UL>
		 <LI>ACTION: Review and comment by next meeting (Facilities Working Group).
	 </UL>
 </UL>

4)  Status of SDTS CADD Profile and Tri-Service Spatial Data Standards - Ed Riegelmann (Tri-Service CADD/GIS Technology Center): <BR>
 <UL>
	 <LI>There are 3 steps to the contracted SDTS CADD Profile development and the contractors are in the middle of step 2.  The steps are:  <P>
	 <UL>
		 <LI>create/review a list of elements that need to be handled by a profile
		 <LI>create/review a list of SDTS elements that will handle the CADD elements
		 <LI>compare the lists to identify what will need to be developed.
	 </UL> <P>

	A final report is due in May with recommendations for the next steps.  Microstation and AutoCad represent 95% of the world's CADD market and since these product vendors are performing the SDTS CADD Profile work, we should get a reliable and useful report. <BR>
	Mr. Jerry Lenczowski (DMA) said that a CADD Profile could help DMA move from the world view to the bird's eye view and he will be glad to provide instances of phenomena that need to be handled by the CADD Profile to support the 3-D modeling/simulation community.
	 <UL>
		 <LI>ACTION:  Mr. Riegelmann will continue to provide status reports as well as the final report for the Facilities Working Group to review (Riegelmann).  Messrs Riegelmann and Lenczowski to coordinate on CADD elements (Riegelmann and Lenczowski).
	 </UL>

	 <LI>Messrs Riegelmann and Kevin Backe (USACE) are preparing a proposal that the Tri-Service Spatial Data Standards (TSSDS), or portions of it, be accepted as an FGDC standard.  They are also reformatting the TSSDS into the pieces that each FGDC subcommittee or working group will need to review, removing agency specific information, etc.  Mr. Riegelmann provided updates on the TSSDS as follows:
	 <UL>
		 <LI>There will be a March mid-release with some fixes but no change of content
		 <LI>DoD will adopt the TSSDS under its Corporate Information Management pillar which is one part of a huge DoD business process engineering effort
		 <LI>Canadians and the U.S. are thinking of proposing the TSSDS as an International Standard.
	
		 <LI>ACTION:  Messrs Riegelmann and Backe to present the proposal and reformatted TSSDS to the Facilities Working Group as soon as possible for approval (Riegelmann and Backe).
	 </UL>
 </UL>

5)  Definition of Facility - Group:  
 <UL>
	 <LI>The group agreed that it needed a tighter definition of  <A HREF="./12-21-95.attatch6.html>"Facility" </A> before it could develop a Facility ID Code Standard (Attachment 5).  The group could not figure out how to tighten the existing definition because facility really does include everything and groups of things. Discussions moved to defining "Installation" instead which seems to have solved some but not all problems.  Mr. Dan McHugh (NY City Transit Authority) provided diagrams of various plant components associated with transportation as an example of what some people consider a facility or an installation/networked facility.
	 <LI>The result of the discussion was that an Installation is a group or network of facilities and the Facilities Working Group should maintain a Registry for Installation IDs and develop some rules and guidelines for Facility IDs.   This would provide, " a big box to put big things (like installations) in and a smaller box to put small stuff (like facilities) in (Mr. McHugh)."  Standardizing on the Installation IDs would enable us to share data and agreeing upon rules/guidelines for facility IDs would give agencies the flexibility they need to assign codes.  Mr. Wiant reminded the group that this is sort of what the Army does and was an acceptable model to the Special Interest Group that investigated this topic for us.
	 <LI>Installations and facilities are things that are stable and not moveable and can be seen from the air or underground.  This excludes mobile things that should really be considered as equipment and excludes the insides of structures or buildings (Mr. McHugh and Mr. Ron Niemi).
	 <LI>We could start with a domain of installations that are of national scope, assign numbers to them, and then let each proponent/sponsoring agency determine the numbers for facilities inside the installations (Mr. Tom Conry).  As it turns out, the FGDC Cadastral Subcommittee has a domain of such things in its Cadastral Content Standard (Ms. Capps).
	 <LI>ACTION: Everyone be prepared to continue this discussion, i.e. bring your ideas on installation and facility definitions that would be appropriate for the proposed heirachical concept (Group)! <P>

 </UL>

6)  Miscellaneous - Group: 
 <UL>
	 <LI>Mr. Rik Wiant (USACE) said that the American Planning Association will meet 13 April in Orlando and there will be a follow on meeting from 17-19 April of the Federal Planning Division.  He hopes to have a TSSDS workshop, FGDC metadata workshop, and an open forum of the Facilities Working Group.   He will bring more information on the conferences to the next meeting.

 </UL>

7) Next Meeting: The next meeting will be 14 February from 1-4 in room 1225 of the Pulaski Building, 20 Massachusetts Avenue, NW, Washington, DC.

Summary Report


 <H3>Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC)
Facilities Working Group Meeting 
11 March 1996 
 </H3>
 <H4>
Headquarters, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE)
Pulaski Building, Washington, DC
 </H4>


1)  Persons Attending:   <A HREF="./03-11-96.attatch1.html">Attendance roster </A> <P> 

* See  <A HREF="./03-11-96.attatch2.html">agenda </A> <P>


2)  Update on FGDC Activities - M.K. Miles/Penny Capps (USACE):
 <UL> 
	 <LI>The Steering Group received a briefing on the National Imagery Agency, which is to be created this Fall.  This new agency is to be created by combining several national imagery offices and the Defense Mapping Agency.  "National" in the title indicates the varied customer base.  The Department of Interior, NASA, etc. will not be included because the focus of this new group is classified image assets.  
	 <LI>The Clearinghouse Working Group had a meeting of experts in the Clearinghouse community a couple of weeks ago to discuss the future of the Clearinghouse and the Metadata standard.  Two key discussion items were the move by FGDC from WAIS to ISITE and the inclusion of sgml tags in metadata files.  Apparently ISITE will provide more capabilities and will be maintained more so than WAIS and the sgml tags will provide for more effective searching and browsing.  Things might be in place for this to happen in 1QFY97. 
	 <LI>The FGDC Subcommittee and Working Group Status Summary Report (It includes recommendations for improving the efficiency of the FGDC) will be discussed at an FGDC-wide meeting on 9 April from 1-4, Room 8222D, HQUSACE, 20 Massachusetts, Avenue, NW, Washington, DC.
 </UL>

3)  Definition of Facility/Installation - (Group):  
 <UL>
	 <LI>The Group decided that it needed a firm definition of Facility and Installation in order to promulgate an ID Code Standard on this type of data.  Mr. Ron Niemi (USACE) presented the definitions that will be included in the Defense Data Dictionary System (DDDS) unless he tells DOD that there is another set of Federal definitions (from the Facilities Working Group) that should be used.  He said that DoD found the FIPS definition of Facility inadequate and there is no FIPS definition of an Installation.  Mr. Dave Catlin (EPA) said they use the term "facility" but not "Installation" and are working to define sub-components of a facility and might use the term "sub-facility." However, they could probably map to another set of terms if the appropriate hierarchy was in place.  Mr. Al Lew (NASA) said they are revising their directives on definitions of facility and installation and this discussion is timely.  The Facilities Group thought the definitions were simple and flexible enough to either use or map to but would like to run through a short exercise to confirm this.  Mr. Dan McHugh (NY Transit) distributed a proposed set of terms and hierarchy using transit data as an example.  Mr. McHugh used a "sandwich" analogy to describe what the Facilities Working Group might want to standardize.  We would standardize on the meat of the sandwich and that would be terms like installation and facility.  The top piece of bread would be networks of installations that could be collapsed down, for example, into a network for national transportation use.  Even higher would be some sort of non-geospatial data that would be used for corporate planning purposes.  The bottom piece of bread would be sub-components of a facility that would be too numerous and controversial to deal with, such as manholes or telephone poles. 
	 <LI>ACTION: By 1 April, members should provide the Chair with comments on the  <A HREF="./03-11-96.attatch5.html">DOD and NY Transit terminology/hierarchy for facility and installation </A>.  Agencies may provide this input as an Excel spreadsheet, Word Perfect or Word Document, via email, or fax.  Include examples of terms, terms you use that won't/will map into the suggested terminology/hierarchy (GROUP).
 </UL>

4)  Development of a Facility/Installation ID Code Standard (Group):
 <UL>
	 <LI>The Group still thinks that this would improve data exchange within the facilities community and that the first step is to finalize some terminology/hierarchy as explained in item 3 above.  Mr. Lew said that NASA does not have a NASA-wide convention for numbering and identifying facilities and installations and that they are interested in this concept.
 </UL>


5)  Proposal of the Tri-Service Spatial Data Standards (TSSDS) as an FGDC Facilities Working Group Standard - Miles, Harold Smith (Tri-Service CADD/GIS Technology Center):
 <UL>
	 <LI>At the last Facilities meeting, the Group agreed to forward a proposal to the FGDC Standards Working Group for using the TSSDS as the integrator of all FGDC content standards and to standardize on some large scale/detailed features and attributes in a variety of thematic categories.  Mr. Miles updated the Group on some recent discussions he had with members of the Standards and Coordination Groups.  The latest proposal suggests that the TSSDS structure be adopted by the FGDC for developing content standards and that the TSSDS be used to integrate all FGDC content standards.  It would be the responsibility of the Standards Working Group, not the Facilities Working Group, and the Tri-Service Center to coordinate this.  The Subcommittees would still be the developer and authority on the content of the standard - the Center would just be used to bundle all these FGDC standards into one comprehensive package and in one format.  This should be a huge step towards identifying overlaps and for promoting the FGDC standards in the non-Federal geospatial data community.  This will be discussed at future Coordination and Standards meetings.
	 <LI>Mr. Miles distributed a  <A HREF="03-11-96.attatch6.html">chart </A> of the TSSDS entity classes and the FGDC Subcommittee standardizing in that area.  He proposed that the Facilities Working Group select some entities or themes that are not currently be addressed by the FGDC to standardize on.  The Group stated that they might be interested in initially standardizing on the information in the TSSDS entities of Utilities, Buildings, Improvements, Communications, and Environmental Hazards.  In the future, they would consider the other unaddressed areas.  Mr. Smith explained the structure and content of the TSSDS and explained that this could be reviewed on the CD that was mailed to the Group last September or they could download the TSSDS from the  <A HREF="http://mr2.wes.army.mil">Tri-Service Center Server </A>.
	 <LI>ACTION: Review the TSSDS information in Utilities, Buildings, Improvements, Communications, and Environmental Hazards.  Be prepared to propose any changes required to meet your agency needs at the next meeting.  Be prepared to propose a standard to the FGDC (GROUP).  
 </UL>

7) Misc: 
 <UL>
	 <LI>Mr. McHugh asked that someone from the Tri-Service CADD/GIS Technology Center make a presentation on the TSSDS at the New York Metropolitan Transit Authority CADD/GIS User Group meeting (April 23).   Mr. Miles said that a letter of invitation is not required unless it is useful for the requestor's internal purposes.  In this case, send a letter to Mr. Miles requesting a presentation on the Facilities Working Group topic of interest to you.

	 <LI>The American Planning Association (APA) conference is 13-17 April in Kissimmee, FL and the first APA Federal Planning Division (FPD) conference will be held 17-19 April in Kissimmee.  The Facilities Working Group Chair will give a presentation on the FGDC, Facilities Working Group, and EO 12906 at the FPD conference.
 </UL>

8)  Next Meeting: The next two meetings will be 8 April and 13 May from 1-4 in the Pulaski Building, 20 Massachusetts Avenue, NW, Washington, DC.

3)  FGDC Subcommittee and Working Group Status Summary Report -  <UL>
	 <LI>Denise Perreca/Richard Hogan (Standards Working Group):
Several contractors met with all the subcommittees and working groups to 
discuss their standards development issues and progress, scope of the group, 
etc.  Mr. Peter Croswell (PlanGraphics) and Ms Denise Perreca (FGDC) attended 
the 21 Sep Facilities Working Group meeting for this purpose.   Ms Perreca 
distributed a draft of the summary report prepared by the contractors.  The 
Standards Working Group and contractors will brief this FGDC Standards Summary 
Report to all FGDC members on 17 Nov from 9-12 at the USGS auditorium. An RSVP 
is requested.  Comments will be accepted until 7 December and the final paper 
is due by the end of 1995. 
 <UL> <LI> ACTION: Facilities Working Group members to review the paper, especially the 
sections on the Facilities Working Group, and provide comments to the Standards 
Working Group by 7 December 1995.
 </UL>
 <LI>Ms Perreca also distributed the latest version of the FGDC Standards 
Reference Model.  This describes the types of standards that the FGDC is 
developing and the process for approval of those standards.
  <UL> <LI>ACTION: Facilities Working Group members to provide comments to Ms Perreca by 17 November.
 </UL>
 <LI>Mr. Hogan (USGS) mentioned that we should get more involved with the 
International Standards Organization (ISO) especially STEP. 
 <UL> <LI> ACTION:  Mr. Hogan to provide Facilities Working Group Chair with STEP POC info and Chair to arrange a briefing on this topic at a Facilities Working Group meeting. 
 </UL> <br>
 </UL>
4) Unique Facilities Identification Special Interest Group (David Hammond, USCG):
Mr. Hammond summarized the information that this group gathered.  The Facilities Working Group members decided to propose a Facilities ID Standard to the FGDC.  Here are some of the remarks that led to that decision, as well as issues that must be resolved and reflected in a proposal:
 <UL> 
  <LI> Facility must be defined more precisely before we pursue a standard.  
There was concern about defining a facility to include events such as a toxic 
spill or mobile sorts of facilities (apparently EPA wants to do this but was 
not there to explain or confirm this).  Mr. Dan McHugh (NY City Transit 
Authority) recommended that we consider the individual entities that are 
facilities as well those things that are networked to comprise a facility.  
The group will spend most of the 21 December meeting resolving this and early 
discussions on the definition are 
 <A HREF="./minutes_10-31-95.attatch3.html">attached </A>.
  <LI> There are existing codes (GSA, DoD, EPA) what are not universal and have 
intelligence imbedded in them.  The Facilities Working Group does not think 
that an intelligent scheme is the way to go (especially after meeting with 
Bellcore on their implementation) but does not want to require agencies to redo 
existing codes.  This is an important criteria to consider in developing a 
facilities standard and could be as simple (?) as adding a new, non-intelligent 
code to existing intelligent codes.
  <LI> Major Costigan (Army) spoke to the modeling community within the Defense 
Environmental Corporate Information Management (DECIM) group and they 
recommended a non-intelligent schema.   Mr. Harold Smith (Tri-Service Center) 
recommended that the DoD reps talk to the DECIM about this standard in the 
hopes of acquiring resources from them to get the standard developed. 
  <LI> There were pros and cons with regard to a central register for these
 codes. The closer the ID register is to the owner the more likely it is that 
the information will be current (con).  A central register provides more 
consistency and less of a burden to more agencies (pro).  Mr. Hogan said the 
banking industry has figured out how to handle this distributed ID problem but 
it might not be the solution for the geospatial data community.
  <LI> Mr. Hogan was disappointed to hear Mr. Wiant (Army) say that the Army has 
little funds to support this sort of effort because during a recent trip to 
Korea, he learned that they are embarking on a huge digitization effort of the 
country and are looking to coordinate with the U.S. Army.  This could be an 
opportunity for the Army to take a lead in this type of work.  Ms Capps 
remarked that the Army Corps sees the benefit in such a standard and might 
be able to allocate some funds towards its development.
  <LI> Major Costigan suggested using latitudes and longitudes as ID codes.  
Members of the group explained that this would not be effective because there 
are multiple features at the same lat/long, there are multiple features at 
different elevations of the same lat/long, and some facilities are mobile.
  <LI> Ms Capps remarked that there is some sort of building ID development 
on-going between the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and 
the U.S. Army Construction Engineering Research Laboratories (CERL).  She and 
Mr. Hammond have not been able to reach POCs.
  <LI> ACTION: Chair to distribute a draft proposal for a FGDC Facilities ID 
Standard to the Facilities Working Group members.  Members  to provide 
additional information (agency need for such a standard, resources to develop 
standard, etc.) and comments on this proposal.  Chair and Mr. Hammond 
to resolve comments and prepare a draft for presentation in early 1996.  
  <LI> ACTION: Chair to distribute early discussions on definition of facility 
so that members can prepare for the 21 December discussions.
  <LI> ACTION:   Chair and Mr. Hammond to contact NIST and CERL about their 
building ID standard development efforts.
 </UL>
5) Unique Feature IDs for the National Geospatial Data Framework 
(Mike Domaratz, FGDC): 
Mr. Domaratz was invited to brief the group about Framework efforts in case 
there might be some commonality between the Framework and Facility Working 
Group approaches to unique feature id schemas.  The FGDC is funding Framework 
pilots and recently held a meeting of the pilot project managers in Charleston, 
SC.  The group: <UL> 
  <LI>Talked about the possible need for different ID schemes for raster and 
vector data
  <LI>Said that Linear Referencing Systems (LRS) might be a suitable ID scheme 
for transportation data but there are multiple LRS even at the state level
  <LI>Thought that the USGS/EPA River Reach codes seem appropriate but there 
will need to be a crosswalk between state codes and the River Reach codes
  <LI>Questioned feature ID codes that could illustrate nested (one feature 
inside of another feature) features
  <LI>Said that the FIPS 55 codes for boundaries were fine. 
 </UL>  

6)  Tri-Service Spatial Data Standards (Capps/Smith):
Mr. Smith gave a quick summary of the Tri-Service Spatial Data Standards (TSSDS).
  The group decided that they would propose the TSSDS as an FGDC standard but 
needed to see it in a different form before they could agree to anything more 
definite, i.e. propose the entire TSSDS or just a portion of it as an FGDC 
standard.  The group recommended that Messrs Smith and Backe reformat the 
TSSDS into the pieces that each FGDC subcommittee or working group would need 
to review, remove agency policies, etc. and then present it to the Facilities 
Working Group for more consideration.   Here are some of the discussions that 
led to this, issues to be resolved or considered, etc.: <UL>
  <LI> There were a lot of remarks on physical model vs. logical model.  The 
TSSDS provides both and can be implemented in several commercial platforms as 
well as GRASS.  This can be an advantage to some users and will be provided as 
a bonusor guide when proposed as an FGDC standard.  It is important for the 
FGDC to not appear to be promoting a particular vendor product but helpful to 
provide available tools to the users.  Mr. Smith would like to keep the TSSDS 
in digital form and said that he could provide the user with buttons on the 
screens to view only those sections of the TSSDS that are being proposed as an 
FGDC standard and still give access to other possible useful information.  
Ms Perreca said that the FGDC Standards Working Group has not set a standard 
for proposing or distributing an FGDC standard.
  <LI> Mr. Racht (USACE) wondered who is going to pay for moving this standard 
through the FGDC process and won't there be a big burden to the DoD facilities 
community every time the TSSDS is modified to be compatible with an emerging 
FGDC standard?  Ms Capps explained that there are some funds in the Tri-Service 
Center budget to specifically cover coordination with the FGDC and that at an 
earlier meeting Mr. Riegelmann (Tri-Service Center) explained that changes to 
the TSSDS would result in a backwardly compatible version.  Mr. Wiant said that 
being able to share data with the local communities warrants moving the TSSDS 
through the FGDC process.  He said this would help us work with our Federal 
Brothers and State Siblings per the Federal Facilities Compliance Act.
  <LI> Mr. Backe explained that because of its large scale/detailed focus, 
the TSSDS could really help bring the FGDC down to the local level and give 
the locals a useful data standard.
  <LI> Ms Capps explained that because of the commitment to coordinate with the 
FGDC, the Center would have to work with subcommittees on the TSSDS regardless 
of the decision of the Facilities Working Group to propose it as a standard.
  <LI> Ms Perreca said that the TSSDS should be briefed as either a standard 
that must incorporate existing/emerging FGDC standards or as something for 
groups to consider adopting if they currently do not have a standard.
  <LI> Mr. Smith explained that the TSSDS uses common tables that are shared and 
therefore has no overlap.  This is something that the FGDC should shoot for.
  <LI> Mr. Hogan relayed the interest at the ANSI X3L1 level to promote the 
TSSDS as a joint Canada/U.S. feature standard.  Mr. Hogan expressed his belief 
that the TSSDS is mature enough to do this.  He also explained that there was 
confusion about the TSSDS, i.e. was it already an FGDC standard because it 
looked so official?  Ms. Capps explained that it was distributed on CD for the 
DoD facilities community to use and therefore was not marked as a Draft.  
It was also distributed outside of this community for comment and/or use.  It 
was not intended to look like an FGDC blessed standard and the accompanying 
cover letter explained this.
  <LI>ACTION:  Messrs Smith and Backe to reformat the TSSDS and present to the 
Facilities Working Group as soon as possible.
 </UL>

7)  Update Work Plan and Charter and write 1995 Accomplishments (Capps):
The FGDC would like updates to group charters and descriptions of 
accomplishments by 17 November.  The group can not do this until they agree 
on a definition of facility at the 21 December meeting. <UL>
  <LI>ACTION: The Chair will fax group members a draft list of accomplishments 
for review.
 </UL>

8) Misc.: GIS/LIS 95 is 13-16 November in Nashville, TN.  There will not be an 
FGDC Coordination Group meeting there but there will be some FGDC members on 
panel discussions and a DoD Data Standards panel discussion (including the 
TSSDS). <P>


9) Next Meeting: The  <A HREF="../next_meeting.html">next meeting </A> will be 
21 December from 1-4 in room 8222D of the Pulaski Building, 20 Massachusetts 
Avenue, NW, Washington, DC.

<h1><u>Introducing Corning Besselaar...</u></h1>
<p>Corning Besselaar is the industry leader in clinical <a
href="ddc.htm">drug development </a>services for both the
pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. To meet a clients
specific needs in the <a href="ddc.htm">drug development</a>
cycle, Corning Besselaar draws upon a world of resources around
the globe.</p>
<p>As part of the <a href="cps.htm">Corning Pharmaceutical
Services (CPS) </a>network, Corning Besselaar can bring together
the combined <a href="drugex.htm">experience</a> and <a
href="servic.htm">capabilities</a> of the world's leading drug
development companies in each stage of the Pharmaceutical and
Biotechnological development.</p>
<p>Corning Besselaar is the world's largest contract research
organisation (CRO) and provides a range of services to the
pharmaceutical industry, assisting in the conduct of the clinical
trials required in the approval procedure for new drugs using the<a
href="technol.htm"> latest technology.</a></p>
<p>The company provides assistance at all stages of the drug
development process, from early pre-approval trials involving
perhaps just 20 healthy volunteers in a hospital setting at the <a
href="phasei.htm">Corning Besselaar Clinical Research Unit </a>in
Leeds UK through to large scale peri-approval studies which may
involve thousands of patients handled by the <a
href="phaseiii.htm">Phase III</a> units and the<a href="edmc.htm">
European Data Management Centre (EDMC).</a> Corning Besselaar's
involvement may be limited to assisting in the monitoring of the
trials or in the preparing of<a href="regulato.htm"> regulatory</a>
documentation. But often it extends to providing a complete
service to a pharmaceutical company involving clinical
monitoring, provision of <a href="regulato.htm">regulatory</a>
and study planning advice and full data management, statistical
analysis and reporting of the results. Over the last 20 years the
company has performed work for clients on over 500 studies in a
broad spectrum of <a href="drugex.htm">therapeutic areas.</a></p>
<p>In providing <a href="ddc.htm">drug development</a> services,
Corning Bessselaar is able to draw upon its <a href="drugex.htm">extensive
experience</a> gained through it many years of operating.
Experience in conducting European and global studies according to <a
href="gcp.htm">GCP</a> as well as a proven track record of
adhering to strict timelines are important determinants in the
selection of a CRO. Corning Besselaar offers all of these
benefits.</p>
<p>Corning Besselaar is part of the <a href="cps.htm">Corning
Pharmaceutical Services</a> Family of companies, which are
committed to providing customer service with integrity and <a
href="iso9001.htm">quality</a>.</p>
<p>Corning Pharmaceutical Services has the vision of providing
the fastest <a href="ddc.htm">development</a> of new
pharmaceuticals with the aim of improving the quality of human
health worldwide.</p>

<h1 align="center"><u>The Drug Development Cycle</u></h1>
<h2><u>Introduction</u></h2>
<p>Drugs are identified as potentially useful in the treatment of
disease, via intensive research within pharmaceutical companies
and academia. Before a drug can be marketed, it must be
thoroughly tested to ensure that it is both safe and that it is
effective against targeted diseases or conditions.This process is
often referred to as the drug development cycle and is made up of
a number of phases.</p>
<h2><a href="hazel.htm">Preclinical</a></h2>
<p>Prior to the administration of drugs to humans, preclinical
studies are conducted using both animal (in vivo) and non-animal
tests (in vitro). In vitro studies include tests on bacteria and
human cells. In-vivo studies are used as predictors of the safety
of the product in people. These tests give information about the
way the drug works and how safe it is. <a href="hazel.htm">Corning
Hazleton</a> is the World&#146;s leading company involved in
preclinical drug safety assessments.</p>
<h2><a href="phasei.htm">Phase I</a></h2>
<p>Once the preclinical data for a drug have been assessed and
the drug has been deemed to be safe, it enters the clinical
phase. This is where the drug is tested in humans. The first
studies in man are usually performed in healthy volunteers and
are termed Phase I studies. Volunteers are paid for their
participation in these studies. They are designed to give a
preliminary evaluation of the drug&#146;s safety and of how the
drug is treated by the body (pharmacokinetics). Most Phase I
studies are conducted in specialised Phase I units, where
experienced medical personnel are available to ensure the safety
of the volunteers. Such a unit is the<a href="phasei.htm">
Corning Besselaar Clinical Research Unit</a> in Leeds, UK, which
is regarded as Europe&#146;s leading <a href="phasei.htm">Phase I</a>
unit. </p>
<h2><a href="phaseii.htm">Phase II</a></h2>
<p>If the drug causes no adverse effects in the Phase I studies
and has the required pharmacokinetic properties, it can progress
to Phase II studies. At this stage the drug is tested in patients
with the intended disease or condition for the first time. These
studies are performed in a small number of patients (typically 10
to 20) and explore the safety and effectiveness of the drug
(efficacy), often against placebo (non-drug) controls. At this
stage the effective therapeutic dose to be used in further trials
will be explored.<a href="phaseii.htm"> Corning Besselaar Phase
II Europe</a> is a dedicated group set up for the conduct of
these specialised clinical trials.</p>
<h2><a href="phaseiii.htm">Phase III</a></h2>
<p>Phase III trials are large scale studies to study the efficacy
and safety of the new drug, prior to the drug being registered
with the regulatory authorities. These studies are often
long-term and involve a sufficiently high number of patients to
be able to prove the efficacy of the drug. The safety profile of
the drug during these studies is examined closely to determine
the risk to benefit ratio of the drug. Frequently the new drug is
compared to other drugs which are already marketed for the
drug&#146;s intended disease or condition. Corning Besselaar is
the World&#146;s leading clinical contract research organisation.
One of the critical components of phase III is the collection of
data. This function is provided by our dedicated <a
href="edmc.htm">European Data Management Centre (EDMC)</a> which
processes clinical trial data and produces a clinical trial
report for submission to the regulatory authorities.</p>
<h2><a href="health.htm">Health Economics</a></h2>
<p>The study of economic factors in clinical trials <a
href="health.htm">(pharmacoeconomics)</a> is becoming more
prevalent. The pressures to lower drug prices means that a drug
has to be proved not only effective and safe but also that it is
cost-effective. Corning Pharmaceutical Services has recently
acquired Health Technology Associates (HTA), forming Corning HTA,
who are specialists in this field.</p>
<h2><a href="pact.htm">Phase IV</a></h2>
<p><a href="pact.htm">Phase IV</a> studies are typically
performed after the regulatory authority grants marketing
approval for the drug. They are used to continue to build the
database on the safety of the drug which may reveal rare
side-effects or interactions or to support the further use of the
drug for it&#146;s indication. <a href="pact.htm">Corning PACT</a>
perform these studies in the US whilst <a href="intro.htm">Corning
Besselaar</a> perform these studies in the UK.</p>

<h1><u>European Regulatory Services</u></h1>
<p><u>REGULATORY AFFAIRS - EUROPE, BUSINESS CENTRE</u></p>
<p>The Corning Besselaar Regulatory Affairs Business Centre
assists client companies to obtain approvals from regulatory
agencies for human medicines, animal medicines and medical
devices so that these products are available for the public.</p>
<h3>European Regulatory Services</h3>
<p>The regulatory environment is ever evolving and the regulatory
challenges in Europe resulting from International Harmonisation,
new European Regulatory Procedures and associated legislation
have never been greater, but we provide our clients with
up-to-date knowledge of the current requirements and speed new
drugs to the market place.</p>
<p>Our regulatory specialists offer experience in developing
innovative regulatory strategies to expedite product development
and marketing approval in the pharmaceutical, veterinary and
device areas.</p>
<p>A successful development programme leads to maximal market
penetration in the shortest cycle time. Corning Besselaar and
Corning Hazleton have experience in identifying development
programmes to obtain marketing approval and in tackling the
various regulatory hurdles to speed new products to market in the
most time-efficient and cost-effective manner.</p>
<h3>Corning Besselaar and <a href="hazel.htm">Corning Hazleton</a>
can assist with:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Strategic advice and constancy</li>
    <li>Preparation of regulatory documentation</li>
    <li>Submission of marketing authorisation applications and
        follow-up</li>
    <li>Regulatory authority liaison</li>
    <li>Co-ordination of clinical trial supplies</li>

</ul>
<h3>World-wide Regulatory Experience</h3>
<p>We aim to provide the highest levels of quality and service
available anywhere in the industry and to help our clients to
achieve their regulatory target in the most time-efficient and
cost-effective way possible. Corning Besselaar and Corning
Hazleton have offices located across Europe, North America,
Australia and Japan. We provide services to support regulatory
requirements across Europe (EU and Central and Eastern Europe),
USA, Canada, Middle East, Africa, Australia, Asia, South America
and Japan.</p>
<h2><u>Experience in developing innovative regulatory strategies </u></h2>
<p>Our expertise in regulatory affairs was recognised by the
European Commission, who chose in 1992 Corning Besselaar in
partnership with Deloitte &amp; Touche to advise on the structure
and operations of the European Medicines Evaluation Agency (EMEA)
at Canary Wharf, London. The EMEA is responsible for
co-ordinating all activities associated with the new centralised
procedure and for co-ordinating adverse event reporting
(pharmacovigilance), GCP, GLP and GMP compliance throughout
Europe.</p>
<p>More recently, Corning Besselaar and Deloitte &amp; Touche
have undertaken a study for the National Drugs Advisory Board
(NDAB) on the recommended structure, systems and procedures for
the proposed Irish Medicines Board.</p>
<p>We work within a Total Quality Management System, which is
applied across all areas of work. The department responsible for
co-ordinating the preparation of regulatory documentation is
accredited to the <a href="iso9001.htm">BS EN ISO 9001</a>
international quality standard for preparation of regulatory
submissions.</p>
<p>Corning Besselaar Quality Assurance and auditing activities
encompass both the audits of investigator sites, clinical
research facilities, regulatory documents, databases and clinical
trial reports, and the process audits of activities in the
operational areas of Corning Besselaar.</p>
<p>Experienced staff with proven records in world-wide regulatory
procedures and strategies and our commitment to Total Quality
Management assures that we will exceed our clients every
expectation.</p>

<h1><u>Good Clinical Practice (GCP)</u></h1>
<p>Good Clinical Practice (GCP) is a standard for the design,
conduct, performance, monitoring, auditing, recording, analyses
and reporting of <a href="ddc.htm">clinical trials</a>. It
provides the assurance that the data and reported results are
credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and
confidentiality of trial subjects are protected. </p>
<p>GCP standards were developed and enforced as recommendations
in the European Community as of July, 1991. The driving force
behind them were disclosures of fraud, quality of clinical
studies varied greatly between investigators and countries and
clinical studies have failed to be pivotal for purely technical
reasons. The results of these problems caused the need to repeat
studies, increased cost of Research and Development and increased
time to market. </p>
<p>The development GCP has a chequered history starting in 1963
with IND regulations, 1964 Declaration of Helsinki, 1976 German
Drug Law, 1978 Spanish Decree, 1980 Nordic Guidelines on Clinical
Trials of Drugs, 1984 Greek Law, 1987 French, German Guidelines,
1988 UK Guideline, 1989 Nordic Guideline, 1991 EC GCP Note for
Guidance and 1993 EC Directive 91/507 on GCP. </p>
<p>The EC GCP for Trial on Medicinal Products is a document with
58 articles in 5 chapters and an annex. It covers: a Glossary,
Protection of Trial Subjects and Consultation of Ethics
Committees, Responsibilities, Data Handling, Statistics and
Quality Assurance. </p>
<p>All Corning Besselaar Europe employees must attend GCP
training seminars. This enables them to gain knowledge of the
fundamentals of GCP in order to follow it in their working
practice. Each employee is also provided with a concise booklet
entitled 'European GCP Note for Guidance' on starting with the
company. </p>

<h2><a href="edmc.htm"><u>EDMC</u></a><u> CERTIFICATION TO BS EN
ISO 9001</u></h2>
<h2>At the beginning of February assessors from BSI QA
recommended <a href="edmc.htm">EDMC</a> for certification to <a
href="http://www.best.com/~iso9000/alt/ISOLinks.html">BS EN ISO
9001</a>, the internationally recognised quality systems
standard. This certification was sought to support EDMC's work to
GCP; one of the demands of GCP being that a quality management
system be in place.</h2>
<p>Any business, from the smallest to the largest, can apply to
register, whether it is a manufacturing or service industry.
Businesses can apply to register one area of their activities or
all of them. Within Corning Besselaar Europe, the <a
href="http://www.corningbesselaar.co.uk">Corning Besselaar
Clinical Research Unit </a>in Leeds gained its certificate in
1995, and is now to be followed by EDMC in 1996.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.best.com/~iso9000/alt/isolinks.html">BS EN
ISO 9001</a> does not impose a standardised bureaucratic system
on a company. In fact, it is not a single system at all, but is
unique to each user. The standard is simple common sense set down
in an organised way, seeking to define best working practices. <a
href="edmc.htm">EDMC</a> decides the best way to run its
business, not the standard or BSI QA. Then, by regular assessment
visits, BSI QA helps to ensure these best practice methods are
being maintained and improved upon.</p>
<p>BSI registered firms report a wide range of benefits . <a
href="http://www.best.com/~iso9000/alt/isolinks.html">BS EN ISO
9001</a> helps to make companies more competitive. Many
registered firms report a significant reduction of waste in both
time and materials. The quality system reduces the risk of
expensive mistakes and enables prompt, effective correction of
any defects. It also ensures a complete record of every activity
to resolve any disputes. Ultimately, pursuit of a policy of
continuous improvement results in more satisfied customers and
more repeat business. </p>

<p>Corning PACT is the world's largest pharmaceutical research
services company dedicated to the design, organisation, conduct
and analysis of Phase IIIb and Phase IV &quot;periapproval&quot;
clinical research studies. </p>
<p>These studies bridge the gap between data derived from
registration (<a href="regulato.htm">regulatory approval</a>)
studies and information needs arising from actual medical
practice. They meet a variety of drug development objectives
including: (a) expanding safety and efficacy data, (b) evaluating
product utility and acceptability in targeted patient subgroups,
(c) reinforcing labelling or advertising claims, (d) collecting
quality-of -life and therapeutic cost data and (e) making novel
therapies available quickly to patients in need (compassionate
use programs). These studies are frequently comparative in design
and may involve several therapies. Corning PACT has conducted
over 70 of these studies, many multinational in scope, involving
more than 500,000 patients.</p>
<p>Currently Corning PACT is involved in two European programs on
behalf of two leading multinational pharmaceutical companies. The
first is a Safety Assessment of Marketed Medicines (SAMM) study
in the United Kingdom. This study is one of the first of its type
in Europe and will involve 2,500 General Practitioners and 20,000
patients. The second is a multinational expanded access program
involving a novel AIDS therapy. This program may have as many as
2,000 physicians and 10,000 patients enrolled throughout Europe,
North America, and Australia.</p>

<h1><u>PHASE II Europe</u></h1>
<p>In late 1994, the Phase II Europe Business Unit was
established to fill the perceived gap between the <a
href="phasei.htm">Phase I Clinic in Leeds</a> and the <a
href="PhaseIII.htm">Phase III</a> group providing the connection
between the two 'clinical phases'. With its objective of becoming
the first choice of pharmaceutical companies for European Phase
II services, the Phase II Europe Unit also set about to compete
for its own, stand-alone business.</p>
<p>Phase II trials are usually the first in which a drug is given
to a specific population of patients. Generally, Phase II studies
involve fewer patients than <a href="PhaseIII.htm">Phase III</a>
and also take less time. Phase II trials are usually the first in
which a drug is given to the patients for whom it is being
developed. These trials assess the drug's activity and short-term
safety, and they are important for determining optimal dose
ranges. Phase II studies typically involve fewer patients and
take less time than Phase III trials.</p>
<p>The Phase II Business Unit's main objective is to become the
first choice of pharmaceutical companies for European Phase II
services. In eighteen months the Phase II Unit has grown from one
person to sixteen with a projected growth by the end of 1996 to
nearly forty personnel. The Unit attracts clients not only with
reputation of <a href="intro.htm">Corning Besselaar</a> but also
with the experience and professionalism within the group and the
multi-lingual capabilities of its French, German and Italian
speakers.</p>
<p>With access to the <a href="hazel.htm">pre-clinical</a> and <a
href="phasei.htm">Phase I</a> results, the Phase II Unit speeds
the early development to completion and can produce a &quot;go/no
go&quot; decision within 12 months. Hence the term <a
href="fastrak.htm">&quot;fast-track&quot;.</a> Phase II Business
Unit aims to assist in the fast-track access for drugs from
pre-clinical studies through to safety and efficacy studies in
patients.</p>
<p>In order to provide the services customers expect of the unit,
close liaison with other Corning Besselaar groups such as <a
href="regulato.htm">Regulatory Affairs</a> and the Phase I Clinic
in Leeds is required.</p>
<p>At present, the Phase II Unit has fifteen ongoing and three
completed studies in therapeutic areas such as asthma and HIV.</p>

<h1><u>Health Economics at Corning Besselaar</u></h1>
<p>Health Economics is the study of choice in healthcare. It aims
to look at how decision makers such as doctors, purchasers of
healthcare services and patients make their choice from the
bewildering way of products and services that are associated with
healthcare under conditions of limited resources.</p>
<p>The increasing demographic pressure of the ageing population
and rising cost of technology are placing an increased emphasis
on health economics in assisting the rational use of healthcare
resources. This effect spills over into the pharmaceutical
industry where companies find themselves being increasingly
pressurised to provide health economic information for drugs and
products that they are introducing or establishing within the
pharmaceutical market place.</p>
<p>This trend is recognised within Corning Besselaar where there
is a commitment to providing high quality, timely, and
appropriate health economic studies, Corning Besselaar, together
with its sister companies, <a
href="http://www.bio.com/home/corning/companies.html">Corning HTA</a>
and <a href="pact.htm">Corning PACT</a> are able to provide the
full range of pharmaceutical economic services. These include:</p>
<h2><a href="phasei.htm"><u>Phase I</u></a></h2>
<p>The application of market assessments and epidemiological
tools to determine the strategic direction of drug programmes.</p>
<h2><a href="phaseii.htm"><u>Phase II</u></a></h2>
<p>The development of complex disease models to use as a basis
for the planning of Phase III and larger population studies.</p>
<h2><a href="edmc.htm"><u>Phase III</u></a></h2>
<p>The execution of health economic studies in parallel with the
Phase III development programme either incorporated within
traditional Phase Ill trials or as standalone health economic
studies.</p>
<h2><a href="pact.htm"><u>Phase IV</u></a></h2>
<p>The continuation of health economic studies into the real
world and naturalistic environment.</p>
<p>Corning Besselaar's strategy in providing health economics
studies, is to allow the pharmaceutical customers to purchase a
package of developments such that the introduction of
pharmacoeconomic and health economic studies can be controlled
and structured within the strategy of the development of
pharmaceutical compounds in today's changing environment.</p>
<p>Services offered by<a href="intro.htm"> Corning Besselaar</a>
are also sensitive to the current political pressures for cost
containment and a growing demand in society for a more
appropriate health care and the interests of the public in
improving the quality and opportunity for choice in healthcare
services. The experience and size of Coming Besselaar allows us
to deliver a high level of service at the stage of interaction
with the investigator site and the regulatory authorities.</p>
<p>This integrated range of services also extends beyond clinical
development into the communication of health economic health
studies within a wider audience. Therefore we are available to
conduct training seminars and exercises with field based
representatives and management staff, have the ability to produce
a wide range of papers and materials and can act as facilitators
with groups of diverse individuals for the description of the
factors important in the development of new compounds, e.g.
enlisting public perception.</p>
<p>The links with <a href="pact.htm">Coming PACT</a> and <a
href="http://www.bio.com/home/corning/companies.html">Corning HTA </a>provide
the services of Coming Besselaar with an instant access to over
twenty years of experience in health economics across the world.
In addition our European staff based in Maidenhead and Brussels
provide a range of experience with European decision-makers such
as the Transparency Commission in France and the District Health
Authorities in the UK. When linking this experience to our <a
href="regulato.htm">regulatory</a> colleagues, a powerful
grouping is formed which enables the speedy and appropriate
communication of health economics data to decision makers and
regulators.</p>
<p>In addition, the European group is very active in the
publications and education field. The recent publication of <strong>Health
Economics for the Uninitiated</strong> by Tony Lockett, one of
the team members within Corning Besselaar Health Economics is
more than testimony to this.</p>

<title>Interactive Voice Response System - IVRS</title>
<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">
<meta name="FORMATTER" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">
</head>
<body background="images/backgrnd.gif">
<h1 align="center"><u><MAP NAME="FrontPageMap"><AREA SHAPE="RECT" COORDS="1, 3, 103, 37" HREF="index.htm"></MAP><a href="/corningb/_vti_map/ivrs.htm.map"><img

usemap="#FrontPageMap" height="38" border="0"></a></u></h1>
<h1><u>IVRS: Interactive Voice Response System</u></h1>
<p>The IVRS is a computer system which uses a standard touch-tone
telephone to manage &quot;just-in-time&quot; clinical trial drug
supplies. IVRS has been shown to dramatically reduce drug wastage
during clinical trials by dynamically assigning study medication
to patients. Investigators communicate with IVRS using the key
pad on a touch-tone telephone. The IVRS responds using digitized
human voice.</p>
<h2>Key advantages of Corning Besselaar's IVRS System</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Offers centralized data collection.</li>
    <li>&quot;just-in-time&quot; management of clinical drug
        supplies.</li>
    <li>Low equipment overhead in the field.</li>
    <li>Multi-lingual and multinational access.</li>
    <li>Simple interface.</li>
    <li>IVRS Assists in Drug Supply Management</li>
</ul>
<p>Each box of drug is numbered uniquely, independent of patient
numbers. A pharmacist or study coordinator calls the IVRS each
time the patient receives drug. Boxes of drug are dynamically
matched to the patient at the moment of assignment.</p>
<p>With an IVRS system only a small start-up supply of drug is
sent to each site. If a patient drops out of the study, no
additional drug supplies are lost. Study sites are resupplied
with drug in a just-in time fashion based on their actual and
projected drug usage. Significant drug savings may be achieved
and clinical trials may begin with minimal supplies while
additional drug is being manufactured. Matching drug to patient
at the moment of assignment allows for pooling of drug supplies
across study protocols.The IVRS also makes real-time enrollment
and visit schedule information available to sponsors while
pharmacists and researchers remain blinded. </p>
<h3>IVRS Assists Dynamic Patient Randomization</h3>
<p>Odds of assignment to a treatment arm are based on information
not available before the trial begins. The most common adjustment
uses treatment counts across sites to adjust treatment
assignments within sites. The balance may be adjusted strictly
within treatment or by overall counts of other stratifying
variables (sex, age, disease progression, etc.)</p>
<h3>IVRS can be used for Study Patient Diaries</h3>
<p>The IVRS is also useful for study patient diaries. New
patients are registered by study coordinators and trained to use
the IVRS for keeping their diaries with the pertinent information
recorded in real time. The IVRS provides automatic reminders if
the patient is late entering data. </p>

<h1><u>CANDAs/CAPLAs</u></h1>
<h1><u>Computer Assisted Submissions</u></h1>
<p><a href="intro.htm">Corning Besselaar</a>'s first CANDA was
prepared in 1987, making our organization a pioneer in computer
assisted development of NDAs. Corning Besselaar's CANDAs have
been well-received by the FDA with 8 completed submissions and a
permanent link established with the FDA for electronic mail.</p>
<h3>Key Advantages of Corning Besselaar's CANDA/CAPLA:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Corning Besselaar utilizes a flexible design for the core
        CANDA, which is easily adaptable to the specific needs of
        each FDA reviewer.</li>
    <li>A hypertext environment allows the reviewer to
        &quot;point and click&quot; to create a path through the
        document following a particular train of thought.</li>
    <li>Menu selections, data queries, reports and special
        functions are tailored to facilitate review.</li>
    <li>Lotus Notes&#174; compatible.</li>
    <li>Scanned CRFs for patients who have dropped out or who
        have serious adverse events.</li>
    <li>Individual patient data retrieval.</li>
    <li>Retrieval of aggregate data across all patients.</li>
    <li>SAS programs can be run against relevant SAS data sets.
        Macros allow statistical reviewer easy access to SAS data
        sets. An integrated sub-setting feature is provided.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Services Corning Besselaar provides to develop a CANDA/CAPLA:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Translation of data into relational database.</li>
    <li>Creation of interactive query screens and procedures.</li>
    <li>Testing/custom designing of the system:</li>
    <li>Integration of documents in hypertext format</li>
    <li>Scanning of CRFs</li>
    <li>Conversion of SAS programs to CANDA systems - exporting
        data to additional software packages</li>
    <li>Installation of the system at the FDA.</li>
    <li>Training.</li>
    <li>Continued support of FDA review.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="intro.htm">Corning Besselaar</a> has provided an
average of two CANDAs per year over the past four years. As
technology continues to evolve, <a href="intro.htm">Corning
Besselaar</a> has the ability to customize and incorporate the
latest hardware and software features to accommodate both sponsor
and FDA reviewer.</p>

<h2><u>Fast Track </u><a href="drugex.htm"><u>Drug Development</u></a></h2>
<p>This is the ability of <a href="cps.htm">Corning
Pharmaceutical Services</a> to help clients take a compound
through development (preclinical through Phase I and II) in a
quick, efficient and cost effective manner. In some cases, the
client can expect a go/no go decision within six months.</p>
<p>This process speeds drugs safely and efficiently through the <a
href="ddc.htm">drug development cycle</a> and assists in bringing
drugs to market in highly competitive fields. Using the fast
track strategy CPS can provide quality products by using multiple <a
href="cps.htm">CPS</a> units to achieve a common goal.</p>
<h2 align="center"><img src="images/fasttrak.gif" align="bottom"
width="250" height="251"></h2>
<h2><u>The Development Group: Your Path to Success</u></h2>
<p>Corning Besselaar<a href="phaseii.htm"> Phase II Europe</a>
provides what no other CRO offers; continuity from pre-clinical,
through Phase I to Phase II. Drug development experts from
Corning Hazleton Europe; the Corning Besselaar <a
href="phasei.htm">Phase I Unit in Leeds</a>, UK; the <a
href="phaseiii.htm">Phase III </a>Department; and the <a
href="regulato.htm">Regulatory</a> Department together with the
Phase II Unit comprise our unique Pharmaceutical Development
Co-ordination Group (PDCG). This Development Group is responsible
for managing pre-clinical, Phase I and Phase II study development
strategies to help create a seamless transition to Phase III.</p>
<p>The PDCG formulates pharmaceutical development strategies;
maintains a complete awareness of commercial positions and
development needs in the pharmaceutical industry; and reviews new
developments, techniques, and service capabilities.</p>
<p>Since the PDCG builds on the &quot;fast track&quot; concept -
speeding the clients drug from pre-clinical to the end of Phase
II studies, linkage of the Phase II Unit with PDCG translates
into faster, more successful, and less costly Phase II studies.</p>

development and reached a &quot;go/no-go&quot; decision within 12
months.</p>
<p>This client began development of its compound at the <a
href="hazel.htm">Corning Hazleton</a> facility, where
pre-clinical and animal toxicity studies were performed. Phase I
studies were successfully completed at <a href="phasei.htm">Corning
Besselaar, Leeds, UK</a>. Having come so far so quickly on the
CPS &quot;fast track,&quot; they naturally chose the <a
href="phaseii.htm">Corning Besselaar Phase II Unit</a> for
completion of the Phase II studies.</p>
<p>The initial pilot Phase II study and escalating dose study on
HIV-positive patients were both performed by the<a
href="phaseii.htm"> Corning Besselaar Phase II Europe</a> group
in Maidenhead, UK. The client continued to utilise the CPS
network for routine patient laboratory tests, assays on
haematology, and blood chemistries by outsourcing to <a
href="http://www.bio.com/home/corning/companies.html">Corning
SciCor</a> in Geneva. Additionally, the pharmacokinetic analysis
of samples was assayed by <a href="hazel.htm">Corning Hazleton </a>in
Harrogate, UK. </p>
<p>By outsourcing its development to Corning Besselaar Europe,
the client met the necessary regulatory requirements and
successfully completed the Phase II studies on their compound
without filing a costly IND. For this emerging drug company, the
CPS &quot;fast-track&quot; meant a &quot;go/no-go&quot; decision
in less than 12 months from pre-clinical through Phase II
development instead of an 18 - 24 months development timeline
with most other CROs.</p>

<h4>A Guide to Process Validation for Pharmaceuticals Produced in
Mammalian Cell Culture </h4>
<h1><u>Introduction </u></h1>
<p>This document is designed to provide an introduction to the
issues to be considered when planning a process validation for a
pharmaceutical produced in mammalian cell culture and intended
for use in man. It serves to demonstrate the approach and thought
processes involved in designing a study for the validation of
each stage of a purification process for the removal or
inactivation of virus. This is a general discussion, and the
exact validation programme for a specific product will need to be
established following detailed discussion between Corning
Hazleton and the client. </p>
<p>Before beginning a process validation it is necessary to have
thought about, and acted upon, a number of key issues. These are
dealt with as they arise under the relevant sections. </p>

<h4>A Guide to Process Validation for Pharmaceuticals Produced in
Mammalian Cell Culture </h4>
<h1 align="left"><u>Why Validate the Purification Process </u>? </h1>
<p align="left">The regulations for licensing of
biopharmaceuticals recommend that safety tests be carried out at
various stages of the manufacturing process. The main emphases of
this testing are on the source material, the bulk product and the
purification process. By thorough testing of the cell banks and
bulk product it is possible to demonstrate that no detectable
virus is present. However, for a number of reasons outlined
below, it is also necessary to validate the process for viral
clearance. </p>
<ul>
    <li>The possibility exists that a new virus will arise and
        that it is not detected in the cell bank or source
        material testing. An example of this was the transmission
        of AIDS by contaminated Factor VIII. This occurred when
        HIV first arose in the population and was not detectable
        by the techniques then employed. By demonstrating that
        the process can clear a wide range of viruses with
        different stabilities and physicochemical properties, a
        manufacturer can impart confidence that any novel virus
        will be cleared from the product. </li>
    <li>Process validation provides some security in case of a
        failure in another part of the system. If a latent virus
        is present in the cell banks but has remained undetected,
        or if a new virus is introduced due to a failure of GMP,
        then the knowledge that the process is capable of
        removing high titres of virus imparts a degree of
        confidence to the safety of the product. </li>
    <li>Some cell lines with important medical potential are
        endogenously infected with virus. Murine hybridoma cell
        banks contain both A- and C-type particles. The A-type
        form intracisternaly where they remain sequestered and do
        not develop further. C-type particles are usually present
        in smaller numbers than A-type particles, but some
        C-types are infectious and are classified according to
        the host range they exhibit i.e ecotropic, xenotropic,
        polytropic or amphotropic. Another example of a cell line
        which is endogenously infected with retrovirus-like
        particles is CHO. All CHO cell lines contain both A- and
        C-type particles but there is no evidence that these are
        infectious. Hence the CHO cell line differs from a murine
        hybridoma in that it has not been shown to produce
        retroviruses capable of horizontal infection. Since it is
        not possible to access a source of retrovirus-free CHO
        cell lines or to have retrovirus free murine hybridomas,
        the only way to demonstrate the safety of a product from
        hybridoma or CHO cells is to show that the purification
        process will clear any potential virus present in the
        starting materials. </li>
    <li>During the cell line characterisation, aliquots are taken
        and assayed for the presence of a range of possible
        contaminants. Even if the results of these tests are
        negative, there remains the possibility that the cell
        bank contains virus not detected due to the statistical
        limitations of sampling. Thus testing of the cell banks
        can never demonstrate that they are absolutely free of
        contamination. </li>
</ul>
<p align="left">It follows therefore, that to give a high level
of confidence in the safety of the final product it is also
necessary to demonstrate that any undetected viral contamination
will be cleared during purification of the product. </p>
<p align="left">The process validation is an integral part of the
testing strategy and should be considered in relation to the cell
line characterisation. As discussed below, the planning of the
validation programme, and the levels of clearance required, will
depend partly on the results of the virus detection assays
carried out on the Master cell bank, bulk product and maximum end
of production cells. </p>

<h4>A Guide to Process Validation for Pharmaceuticals Produced in
Mammalian Cell Culture </h4>
<h1><u>Viruses to be used in the Validation </u></h1>
<h2>Considerations regarding the choice of virus </h2>
<p>From the discussion above, it follows that the purification
process should be validated for the clearance of a range of
viruses. This is done by spiking chosen stages of a scaled down
version of the purification process with a known high titre of
challenge virus. The titre of virus is then re-assayed after each
treatment, and the reductions caused by each purification stage
are used to determine an overall clearance factor for the
process.The choice of virus used in the validation depends on a
variety of factors. </p>
<h4>Cell line used in production </h4>
<p>The number and type of virus to be used in the testing of a
hybridoma cell line will depend on the origin of the cell line
i.e. mouse, rat or human. A minimum of three viruses is required
in the validation but more may be necessary. Where a virus is
known to be present in the cell line, one should demonstrate that
the process can clear high enough titres of that virus, or of a
similar model virus, to give confidence that no virus will remain
in the final product. Thus a process validation for a murine
hybridoma product should include a murine retrovirus.A well
characterised hamster cell line, such as CHO, which has been
shown to be free from adventitious agents poses a relatively low
risk. On this basis we believe a strong case can be made for
validating the purification process with only three viruses.In
contrast a product purified from human blood may be considered as
relatively high risk, and it may be necessary to include four or
more viruses in the validation.Where possible the viruses should
be relevant ie. viruses which are able and likely to infect the
production cell. However, where a cell line does not exhibit a
wide host-range (CHO cells fit into this category) or where it is
not possible to assay for the virus of principle concern (eg
there is no in vitro culture assay for hepatitis B virus) certain
model viruses are proposed. </p>
<h4>Range of viruses to be included </h4>
<p>The process should also be validated against a range of virus
types with different physicochemical properties and stabilities.
Points to consider in selecting these viruses include the type of
nucleic acid present in the genome and whether they possess a
lipid envelope. The range of viruses used should include at least
one that is known to be difficult to inactivate. Poliovirus, for
example, is suitable in this regard since it is small and
non-enveloped. Hepatitis A is now widely used at <a
href="HAZEL.HTM">Corning Hazleton</a> as this is significantly
more resistant to heat treatment than poliovirus and a
quantitative plaque assay has been developed. </p>
<h4>Availability of high titre stocks in serum-free medium </h4>
<p>The maximum possible clearance which can be demonstrated for a
particular purification step depends on the starting titre of the
virus stock. Hence it is advantageous to start with virus stocks
which are as high titre as possible. The titres of some of the
stocks available at Corning Hazleton are shown in Appendix 1. </p>
<h4>Plaque assays vs TCID50 </h4>
<p>Plaque assays allow for a more accurate determination of
residual titre than a TCID50 assay. Therefore to obtain viral
clearance factors with high degrees of statistical significance
it is preferable to use the plaque assay. However, there are some
viruses which cannot be titred by plaque assay, including
maedi-visna virus and porcine parvovirus (PPV), and for these
Corning Hazleton uses a TCID50 assay. </p>
<h2>Example of the choice of virus </h2>
<p>To illustrate these points the viruses we recommend for a
either a murine hybridoma or for a CHO-derived product are
discussed below. </p>
<h4>Hybridoma process validation </h4>
<p>We are assuming that no contaminants have been detected in the
cell banks other than A-type and C-type retroviruses, and the
purification methods are varied and stringent. However the
requirements will depend on the type of hybridoma e.g
murine-murine, human-murine or human-human. A minimum of 3
viruses should be used in the process validation and appropriate
viruses are described below.All hybridomas should be tested for
clearance of retroviruses. For murine hybridomas the clearance of
murine leukaemia virus (MuLV) should be demonstrated as this
virus is present in murine lymphoid cells. This virus is also
useful in the validation of murine-human hybridomas.Herpesviruses
may occur in murine lymphoid cells and so should be included in
the validation process. Where human cells are used it is also
necessary to demonstrate clearance of herpesviruses and it is of
particular importance to demonstrate clearance of herpesvirus if
EBV has been used in producing the hybridoma. Herpesviruses are
double stranded DNA enveloped viruses and HSV-1 and infectious
bovine rhinotracheitis virus (IBRV) are suitable models.A
picornavirus such as polio should also be used. This is a small,
non-enveloped RNA virus which is difficult to kill and so can
demonstrate the stringency of the process.In addition, it is
necessary to demonstrate clearance of the retrovirus subgroup,
lentivirus when human cells are used. Maedi-visna virus is an
appropriate model virus for this purpose.Other viruses should be
included as required depending on the history of the cells used
to make the hybridoma. </p>
<h4>CHO cell process validation </h4>
<p>We are assuming that no contaminants have been detected in the
cell banks other than A-type and C-type retroviruses, and the
purification methods are varied and stringent. Hence it is
possible to use only three viruses.The choice of Parainfluenza
type 3 (PI3) virus meets the requirement for a relevant virus as
it is infectious for CHO cells. It is medium sized, enveloped and
relatively labile.The choice of a retrovirus is almost mandatory
in these circumstances since apparently all CHO lines possess
non-infectious A type retroviruses. We include a murine
xenotropic retrovirus as a model retrovirus to fulfil this
condition.Poliovirus is a good model virus because it is
relatively stable to inactivation and is one of the smallest
viruses.If the clearance is predicted to be due to processes
which inactivate by interaction with nucleic acid, it may be
sensible to also include a DNA virus. Suitable candidates would
be either SV40 virus (which is, like poliovirus, a relatively
resistant virus) or herpes simplex (which is enveloped).This
range includes enveloped and non-enveloped viruses and those with
DNA and RNA genomes. All of these viruses are available at
Corning Hazleton at high titre. Other viruses available at
Corning Hazleton are shown in Appendix 1. </p>

<h4>A Guide to Process Validation for Pharmaceuticals Produced in
Mammalian Cell Culture </h4>
<h1>Initial Studies </h1>
<h2>Introduction </h2>
<p>There are various factors which need to be fully considered
before validation, and we are happy to advise clients on all
aspects of the experimentation. In our experience much time and
effort can be saved by detailed discussions between ourselves and
the client, and we encourage clients to come to us as early as
possible to accomplish this. </p>
<h2>The selection of the stages of the process to be validated </h2>
<p>Where two individual stages remove or inactivate virus by
different chemical or physical means, the reduction of viral
titre for each stage may be multiplied together to arrive at a
total clearance factor for the two stages. Where the stages
operate by similar methods the clearances must be added, because
of the possibility that a fraction of virus remaining after the
first stage will be resistant to the second stage. Hence it is
recommended that, where possible, the stages selected for
validation should clear virus by different modes of action, in
order to maximise the demonstrable clearance. Corning Hazleton
can advise on the best approach when choosing the stages to
validate. </p>
<h2>Process scale-down </h2>
<p>The US and European regulations require that the data provided
on validity of scale down should be satisfactory, and it will be
necessary to compare the behaviour of the scaled down and full
scale processes.Technical problems may arise where the degree of
scale down is too extensive, since the use of very small volumes
leads to a decrease in the accuracy of the virological detection
methods. It is also important to ensure the addition of virus
does not substantially dilute, or alter in other ways, the
composition of the load buffer. For this reason, the volume of
virus suspension added should not normally exceed 10% v/v of the
starting solution. The actual volumes used will depend on the
process, but typically we recommend aiming to work with solutions
of about 10ml, and spiking with 0.5ml of virus. High titre,
serum-free virus is of great value in this respect.It should also
be noted that the scale down ratio does not need to be the same
for all parts of a process. Thus an early stage which deals with
very large volumes may need to be scaled down more than a later
stage which deals with correspondingly smaller volumes. In all
cases however, adequate data must be provided to show there is
good correlation between the activity of the product or other
markers in the full-scale process and in the scale down. </p>
<h2>Cytotoxicity and viral interference assay </h2>
<p>It is most important to determine the toxicity of the
solutions used in the process before starting the validation.
This is done by adding serial dilutions of the test solutions to
the indicator cell monolayers. The monolayers are then cultured,
and the maximum concentration of the test solution which does not
cause toxic effect is noted.A concentration of test solution
which is non-cytotoxic may still interfere with viral infectivity
assay. Viral interference may take place because test solutions
alter cell surface receptors, or because they change the
electrostatic charges on the surface of cell and virus. To
investigate this, indicator monolayers are prepared in serial
dilutions of the test solution. They are then inoculated with a
known number of plaque forming units of selected virus. The
numbers of plaques which are formed at different concentrations
of the test solution are then compared, and the maximum
concentration of test solution which does not cause cytotoxicity
or viral interference is then selected for use in the validation.
An example is shown in Appendix 2. Further problems are caused if
the product itself interferes with the assay such as in the case
of certain cytokines. In these circumstances it may be acceptable
to carry out the validation in the absence of the product whilst
ensuring the overall protein concentration is maintained. </p>

<h4>A Guide to Process Validation for Pharmaceuticals Produced in
Mammalian Cell Culture </h4>
<h1><u>Method of Validation</u> </h1>
<h2>Introduction </h2>
<p>During the validation each virus is added to the selected
stages, and residual titre is determined by culture assay. At <a
href="HAZEL.HTM">Corning Hazleton</a> we assay samples
immediately to give as accurate a titre as possible; a proportion
of the sample is also frozen to assay later in the event of
unforeseen difficulties. All fractions are assayed in triplicate
to obtain statistically significant results, and the validation
of each step is usually performed on two occasions for each virus
to demonstrate repeatability. </p>
<h2>Validation of purification processes </h2>
<p>For regulatory submission it is required that, where a
purification step relies on viral removal, the distribution of
the virus so removed should be investigated. This will involve
comparing the distribution of virus and product, in order to
demonstrate a margin of safety between the product peak and the
virus. Since the column eluate can be of high volume, it may be
necessary to give particular consideration to the volume of each
fraction which should be assayed. It will be particularly
important to assay a large proportion of any fraction which
contains the product, in order to demonstrate that virus and
product do not co-elute. </p>
<p>Where the virus is retained on a column, it will be required
to show that the column regeneration buffer is either virucidal
or purges the virus from the column. </p>
<h2>Kinetics of viral inactivation </h2>
<p>In order to achieve high enough viral clearance it is often
necessary to include a virus inactivation step in the process. A
number which have been successfully used by manufactures are
shown </p>

</center></div>
<p>Where a stage of the process inactivates virus, it is
necessary to demonstrate the kinetics of the reaction. The most
effective treatments are those which exhibit first order
kinetics, with a linear reduction in virus titre over time. Where
the reaction is not first order, there exists the possibility
that a proportion of the population is resistant to the effects
of the particular treatment, hence it may be necessary to
demonstrate greater overall clearance to impart confidence in the
system. </p>
<p>A preliminary to this will be to demonstrate that the product
is stable under the conditions of inactivation. Viruses are then
treated by the inactivation process, and samples are removed at
various time points and assayed for residual titre. An
understanding of the inactivation process is necessary to choose
which time points to assay - with some inactivation processes
virus kill is accomplished rapidly and hence early time points
will be necessary. With any process it will be advantageous to
demonstrate that all virus is inactivated before the end on the
incubation time, rather than simply assaying virus at the
beginning and end of the process. In order to assist in the
planning of validation of an inactivation step is sometimes
useful to perform an initial screening study to investigate the
effect of the process on the virus of concern (<a
href="procva10.htm">see Appendix 3</a>). </p>

<h1><u>Results </u></h1>
<h2>Quantification of overall viral clearance </h2>
<p>During the validation the clearance factors of individual
stages of the purification process will be determined. Depending
on whether these stages act by different mechanisms, these
factors are then added or multiplied. The final result is
expressed as a clearance factor for each virus over the whole
purification process. For all validations Corning Hazleton has a
statistics department which can assist in the planning of the
validation and in the interpretation of results. </p>
<h2>Acceptable overall clearance factors </h2>
<p>Since applications for licensing are dealt with on a
case-by-case basis, and the recommended viral clearance may vary
depending upon circumstances, it is not possible to state
categorically the clearance factor which should be achieved. This
will usually vary between the different challenge viruses. One
useful consideration is that the level of contamination of final
product should be less than or equal to one infectious unit per
one million doses. Where a known contaminant has to be removed
the initial titre can be determined and used to calculate the
necessary degree of virus removal. Thus for a murine hybridoma
product it is possible to calculate the titre of retroviruses
present in the culture supernatant by electron microscopy, and
use this to calculate the required clearance factor. Clearly this
is only a useful method where a known contaminant has to be
removed, and is not applicable to challenges using model viruses.
In these instances, it would be necessary to set a theoretical
upper limit of contamination and hence a desirable overall virus
reduction factor which would incorporate a safety margin to take
account of factors such as differences between the scale down and
manufacturing plant and differences between model and relevant
viruses. In such cases it is recommended that the purification
process should have at least one stage which gives a clearance of
at least 105 for viruses of direct concern, and an overall
clearance sufficient to include a high margin of safety if
possible. </p>

<h1>Process Validation Service </h1>
<p>The information given in this document is, of necessity,
general in outline. Initially, a period of extensive consultation
with clients is required to advise on the planning of all aspects
of the experiments. We have found this to be a very valuable
preliminary to practical work which saves much time and effort in
the long run. </p>
<p>The validation itself usually involves personnel from the
manufacturing company running the scaled down process at<a
href="HAZEL.HTM"> Corning Hazleton</a>. Corning Hazleton provide
a controlled temperature laboratory for exclusive use, plus all
the staff required to provide load buffer spiked with high titre
virus and to accept and assay samples as they are generated by
the purification step. The purification is performed to GMP,
normally by the manufacturer, all other aspects of the work are
carried out by Corning Hazleton staff to GLP. Corning Hazleton
can, if desirable, carry out the whole process on behalf of the
client. We recommend that each stage is validated in duplicate. </p>
<p>We have available a range of high titre virus stocks prepared
in serum-free medium, and have much experience of performing
accurate and reliable plaque and focus-forming assays for their
detection. During the running of a validation a large excess of
cultures of indicator cells are provided to enable unforseen
circumstances to be accommodated, and Corning Hazleton staff are
available 24 hours a day if required. </p>
<p>During the study we fax results to clients as soon as they
become available, and complete, in-depth, draft and fully audited
final reports (one for each virus studied if required) will be
provided at the end of the study. </p>

<h4>Viral interference </h4>
<p>The test solution was serial diluted and added to monolayers
of vero cells. Twenty plaque forming units of poliovirus were
added to each monolayer. After one hour incubation the
supernatant was removed and replaced with medium. The number of
plaques recorded on plates with test solution was compared to the
number recorded on plates in medium. </p>

<h4>Conclusion </h4>
<p>A 1 in 10 dilution of test solution is non-cytotoxic, but
interferes with the ability of polio to infect vero cells. Hence
in the process, the test solution/virus mixture was diluted 1 in
100 before assay. </p>

<h2>Example of an initial screening study for an inactivation

<h4>Effect of formaldehyde on poliovirus </h4>
<p>A stock of poliovirus at 7.5 x 107 plaque forming units
(pfu)/ml was treated with formaldehyde solution at 100&#181;g/ml
at two temperatures, in the presence and absence of added
protein. At various time points an aliquot was removed and the
residual titre determined by plaque assay. </p>

<h4>Conclusion </h4>
<p>As expected, virus kill is accomplished more rapidly at higher
temperature, and at low temperature the addition of protein has
some protective effect. </p>

<h2><u>MANAGED CARE - What Does It Mean?</u></h2>
<p><strong>Tony Lockett, Head of </strong><a href="HEALTH.HTM"><strong>Health
Economics</strong></a><strong>, Corning Besselaar, Maidenhead UK</strong></p>
<h3><u>Introduction </u></h3>
<p>Managed care is an often quoted but misunderstood term. It is
used as a &quot;cover all&quot; term for a range of health
delivery services, which seeks to manage the care received by
consumers. This in contrast to fee for service (FFS) systems
where the care is unmanaged. More recently managed care systems
have become synonymous with the range of tools used to control
utilisation of services by consumers and manage the practice of
the health professionals offering care.<br>
Managed care first started in the US health care system, where
purchasers and payers sought methods to control expenditure.
Managed care systems are now employed by all health maintenance
organisations (HMOs) and preferred provider organisations (PPOs)
in the USA. Indeed it has been said that HMOs grew out of the
need to manage health care resources. The approaches taken y
these organisations to manage health care resources have one or
more of the following features:</p>
<ul>
    <li>a hierarchical, vertically integrated structure.</li>
    <li>financial incentives that involve showing risk.</li>
    <li>a series of utilisation controls.</li>
</ul>
<p>These features are usually manifest as a move from payment on
a fee for services basis to payment for package of care, or
payment for a flat fee or capitation for the total care of a
patient.</p>
<h3>Managed care in the US </h3>
<p>The introduction of managed care into US health care has been
part of a revolutionary change which has occurred during the last
20 years. In the 1960s the majority of Americans were covered by
private insurance. Under this system care was paid for under a
'Fee For Service' and providers of care were more or less free to
give any treatment at any cost. The government sponsored the
health care for those who could not afford it under Medicare (for
the disabled and elderly) an Medicaid (for the poor)<a
href="#Gabel J., Jajich-Toth C., De-Lissoroy G., Rice, T., Cohen H., The changing world of group health insurance. Health Affairs 1988: (Summer).">2</a></p>
<p>Into this system European immigrants introduced pre-paid group
practices, to resemble the sick funds seen in continental Europe.
HMOs, as these organisations were subsequently rechristened, have
gradually become a major model in the delivery of US health care,
and by the late 1980s over 50% of Americans were enrolled in HMO
plan. HMOs are responsible for managing a fixed amount of money
to provide health care to a determined population. They do this
by a variety of contractual agreements with providers of care.<a
href="#Gabel J., Jajich-Toth C., De-Lissoroy G., Rice, T., Cohen H., The changing world of group health insurance. Health Affairs 1988: (Summer).">2</a><br>
There are several types of HMO. The earliest version was the
staff model, where a group of physicians would care for a single
HMO's patients. In this situation the medical staff are usually
salaried employees of HMO. A variation on this is the group model
where groups of doctors remain an independent legal body and
serve an HMO on a fee for services basis.<br>
Another model for HMO structure is the individual physician
association (IPA). Originally, as the name suggests, IPA models
were made up of solo practitioners contracting on a fee for
service basis. This model of HMO has now evolved into a network
of care model. They are the most numerous type of HMO seen in the
USA and account for 78% of the HMOs.<a
href="#Weiner J.P., Ferris D.M., GP budget holding in the UK, lessons from America. Kings Fund Institute Research Report 7, 1990.">1</a><br>
Outside the managed care plans offered by HMOs other arrangements
have evolved to offer managed care. These include the plans
described below.</p>
<p><em><strong>Preferred provider organisations (PPO) </strong></em><br>
Where there is a 'broker' acting between the purchasers and
providers of care. The providers of care are still charging a fee
for service basis.</p>
<p><em><strong>Competitive medical plans (CMP) </strong></em><br>
A plan where there are capitation payments made to providers of
care, based on the average cost of treatment per head and risk
sharing agreement. These plans differ from HMOs as they are not
federally regulated.</p>
<p><em><strong>Health insurance organisations (HIO)</strong></em> <br>

<h2>The pros and cons of managed care </h2>
<p>The basic assumption underlying managed care is that the
process will manage health care resources more efficiently than
individual decision making. If this is to be the case then in
addition to sound theoretical frameworks more concrete skills are
needed. These skills include financial, contracting, human
resources and actuarial skills.<br>
The issues thrown up by a move to managed care are complex. They
can be broken down into re-imbursement/capitation problems,
risks, information systems, management, accounting, pharmacy,
conflicts of interest and equity.</p>
<p><strong><u>Reimbursement/capitation</u></strong> <br>
As identified earlier, most managed care systems have a fixed
budget to purchase health care for this population. In order to
maximise the use of their budget the organisations spend on a
capitation, not fee for service basis. This implies that the
organisation offers a set amount of resource for every patient in
its list to the providers of care. Most managed care capitation
is based on age and sex. Studies have shown that demographic
variables such as deprivation scores, make little difference to
the resource use. However, the incorporation of previous service
use and population morbidity measures increase the value of
capitation formulae.<br>
It is likely that no formula can predict the total amount of
resources consumed or committed to the care of patients. The most
sophisticated formula developed, including previous use and
mobidity factors, only predicts 50% of the expenditure per
person. This has considerable influence on the role of risk
management in managed care.3</p>
<p><strong><u>Risk management</u></strong> <br>
The development of a managed care system involves the
establishment and management of risk pools. The size of these
pools is determined by actuarial derived formulae to calculate
the outgoing claims.<br>
In managed care in the USA the risk of pools are often split into
an overall pool and a physician pool. The overall pool is a
measure of the total risk, while the physician pool is the risk
attributable to an individual physician. While it is generally
accepted that the overall pool must be fairly large, the size of
the physician pool is open to question. The physician pool
provides a major incentive to the behaviour of HMO-contracted
medical care. As an empirical rule, the individual pool should be
larger then 300 patients.1</p>
<p><strong><u>Managed information system (MIS)</u></strong> <br>
Information is the element needed in all health care systems.
However, information systems are complex and expensive to
administer, as well as being time-consuming to develop. Despite
these problems, experience with managed care has suggested that
the pre-requisite for success is the information systems. In
studies of network HMOs the major determinate of stability was
the size of the enrolment pool, then the information system. MIS
has been referred to as the glue that holds managed care together<a
href="#Weiner J.P., Ferris D.M., GP budget holding in the UK, lessons from America. Kings Fund Institute Research Report 7, 1990.">.1</a></p>
<p><strong><u>Management expertise </u></strong><br>
The HMO model in the USA has demonstrated that expertise in
accounting, human resources, information technology, quality and
negotiation are all essential in the success of managed care
organisation. However, these skills do not come cheap, and
management overheads for managed care organisations are high.1</p>
<p><strong><u>Accounting problems </u></strong><br>
Although there are general accounting needs in managed care,
there are also specific ones. A major problem is the 'incurred by
not reported expenditure' or IBNR. IBNR occurs because of the
backlog and time delays between expenditure being incurred and
appearing in the financial statements. Thus, organisations maybe
incurring massive debts when it is being reported that the
organisation is in profit. This is generally handled by the
construction of lag schedules.1</p>
<p><strong><u>Pharmacy services </u></strong><br>
Managed care programmes have had considerable impact in
increasing the amount of expenditure devolved to pharmacy
budgets. In response to this increase, changes have been made to
prescribing controls. One of these has been the development of
drug utilisation reviews and clinical guidelines. Also, most
managed care groups mandate generic substitution and a few have
developed practice formulas. One more extreme measure involves
the practice of therapeutic substitution. This involves a
pharmacist being given the ability to substitute classes of drugs
on the grounds of efficiency or effectiveness. Other
controversial measures include types of patient controls, for
example, limited quantities of drugs or the use of trial doses.
These measures are believed to reduce waste, although evidence is
scant.1</p>
<p><strong><u>Quality assurance (QA) </u></strong><br>
Quality assurance is one of the major strengths of the HMO system
in the USA. Particular emphasis is placed on the role of QA in
improving the effectiveness and efficiency of care. Therefore the
quality assurance programme is usually extensive and based about
six key steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Identification of problems.</li>
    <li>Establishment of measurable criteria.</li>
    <li>Data Collection.</li>
    <li>Identification of a strategic direction.</li>
    <li>Introduction of Improvements.</li>
    <li>Re-monitoring.</li>
</ol>
<p>The focus of much of the QA activity has been on primary care.
It is very common in a typical HMO of 50,000 individuals that
monthly audit of 30 patients in a specific issue are examined.
The QA aspects of managed care are continually under review.
Recent developments have included:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The incorporation of quality into MIS</li>
    <li>The development of community and population QA measures.
        i.e. 'list' not individual measures.</li>
    <li>The adaptation of industrial models of QA.<a
        href="#Weiner J.P., Ferris D.M., GP budget holding in the UK, lessons from America. Kings Fund Institute Research Report 7, 1990.">1</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Equity </u></strong></p>
<p>HMOs have identified problems in delivering care to those
individuals of lower social classes. This led to the suggestion
that managed care programmes may be inequitable. In attempts to
address this issue many HMOs are looking at delivery mechanisms
to lower classes, which may avoid physician care.</p>
<p><strong><u>Conflict of interest </u></strong><br>
One of the major concerns about managed care models is that there
is evidence emerging from the USA that they heighten the clash of
interests between insurers and physicians. This centres on the
use of protocols to deny treatment to expensive patients, in the
interest of the HMO and physicians reducing the care to complex
patients in order to maximise profits. This problem is so acute
that federal regulations are being proposed.</p>
<p><strong><u>Models of managed care </u></strong><br>
In the light of the need to deliver health care, managed care has
developed two major models as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li><em><strong>Macro managed care models </strong></em><br>
        These are models designed to cross the primary and
        secondary care interface. They would cover, for instance,
        the hospitalisation drug therapy and home care for a
        surgical patient.</li>
    <li><br>
        <em><strong>Micro models of managed care </strong></em><br>
        These focus on specific areas, such as the control of
        primary care drug prescribing, or asthma care. They cover
        areas such as prescribing, practice nursing care,
        education with the aim of improving quality and cost
        containment.<br>
        Both of these models are widely employed in the USA.</li>
</ul>
<h2><u>Managed care in the UK </u></h2>
<p>Managed care has been lifted up the health care agenda as a
result of EL 94(94).<a href="#Epstein A">4</a><br>
This EL was in response to the increasing number of approaches
being made by drug companies and HMOs to DHAs in the UK.
Referring to disease management packages and discounted drug
prices, it urged caution. Despite the letter, many DHAs are
looking at managed care to make better use of resources. Indeed
some authorities have said that one of the few ways to make
primary care-led purchasing really effective would be to
introduce managed care. However, the HS, set up as it was as a
social system, presents considerable barriers to the introduction
of this process.</p>
<p>Foremost in many peoples' mind would be problems associated
with corporate governance. The NHS has recently been rocked by
many scandals involving the supply of services, most notably
computer services. The idea of entering into partnership with
commercial companies, which in some ways may involve the
exclusive use of products and services does not sit easily with
many people.</p>
<p>If the problem of governance could be overcome there are a
number of practical issues to consider. The first of these would
be the availability of information to develop and maintain the
care. Medical records are confidential and there is some debate
about the legality of external agencies auditing them In addition
to this, much of the information is not available, especially in
community care.</p>
<p>The gaps in information are compounded by the lack of
information on performance measurement in primary care. It is
unclear what drives primary care performance and until clearer
measures are available managed care becomes difficult.<br>
The current tendering regulation also presents barriers to the
introduction of managed care. Currently it is required that
non-clinical contracts in excess of &#163;140,000 should be
tendered (this is currently under review). Therefore it is likely
that if DHAs wanted to introduce managed care these services
would have to be tendered for. This would be a problem in cases
where drug companies wanted to introduce care.</p>
<p>Managed care is also in conflict with much of the performance
measurement applied to DHAs at present. The development of risk
management requires, for effective enforcement, the ability of
DHAs to make savings and deficits, currently not allowed. Managed
care may also inflate pharmacy budgets at the expense of hospital
care budgets. This would cause problems with the current drive on
prescribing costs. The development of managed care would also
cause problems with the efficiency index which monitors
purchasers. It is likely that managed care would shift resources
away from FCEs, unacceptable at the current time of monitoring
local services by the number of patients treated.<br>
This shift would cause further problems in withdrawing funding
from acute hospitals, possibly leading to hospital closure.<br>
<br>
These problems would have most impact on the macro models of
managed care. They would appear to offer few obstacles to micro
models. However, it has been argued that at present there is
little need for micro models in the UK. Most of the techniques
used by micro models are already standard practice. The use of
generic prescribing, and reducing prescribing amounts are already
widely used. It is also known that prescribing costs are already
low in the UK. So the benefits from micro models would be
considerably reduced when compared with the USA.</p>
<p>One possible solution to these problems would be to develop
provider based managed care models, which the provider of care
can then market. If these were to be NHS Trusts then many of the
immediate problems would be solved. It would like to provider
performance, and solve the issues of reduction in acute
contracts.</p>
<h2><u>Conclusion </u></h2>
<p>Managed care has been used for the USA for many years. Some of
the features have been introduced into the UK system already and
if the development is to continue then changes in the regulatory
structure are required.</p>

<h1 align="center"><u><MAP NAME="FrontPageMap"><AREA SHAPE="RECT" COORDS="1, 3, 103, 37" HREF="index.htm"></MAP><a href="/corningb/_vti_map/ivrs.htm.map"><img

<h1><u>IVRS: Interactive Voice Response System</u></h1>
<p>The IVRS is a computer system which uses a standard touch-tone
telephone to manage &quot;just-in-time&quot; clinical trial drug
supplies. IVRS has been shown to dramatically reduce drug wastage
during clinical trials by dynamically assigning study medication
to patients. Investigators communicate with IVRS using the key
pad on a touch-tone telephone. The IVRS responds using digitized
human voice.</p>
<h2>Key advantages of Corning Besselaar's IVRS System</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Offers centralized data collection.</li>
    <li>&quot;just-in-time&quot; management of clinical drug
        supplies.</li>
    <li>Low equipment overhead in the field.</li>
    <li>Multi-lingual and multinational access.</li>
    <li>Simple interface.</li>
    <li>IVRS Assists in Drug Supply Management</li>
</ul>
<p>Each box of drug is numbered uniquely, independent of patient
numbers. A pharmacist or study coordinator calls the IVRS each
time the patient receives drug. Boxes of drug are dynamically
matched to the patient at the moment of assignment.</p>
<p>With an IVRS system only a small start-up supply of drug is
sent to each site. If a patient drops out of the study, no
additional drug supplies are lost. Study sites are resupplied
with drug in a just-in time fashion based on their actual and
projected drug usage. Significant drug savings may be achieved
and clinical trials may begin with minimal supplies while
additional drug is being manufactured. Matching drug to patient
at the moment of assignment allows for pooling of drug supplies
across study protocols.The IVRS also makes real-time enrollment
and visit schedule information available to sponsors while
pharmacists and researchers remain blinded. </p>
<h3>IVRS Assists Dynamic Patient Randomization</h3>
<p>Odds of assignment to a treatment arm are based on information
not available before the trial begins. The most common adjustment
uses treatment counts across sites to adjust treatment
assignments within sites. The balance may be adjusted strictly
within treatment or by overall counts of other stratifying
variables (sex, age, disease progression, etc.)</p>
<h3>IVRS can be used for Study Patient Diaries</h3>
<p>The IVRS is also useful for study patient diaries. New
patients are registered by study coordinators and trained to use
the IVRS for keeping their diaries with the pertinent information
recorded in real time. The IVRS provides automatic reminders if
the patient is late entering data. </p>

<h1><u>Health Economics at Corning Besselaar</u></h1>
<p>Health Economics is the study of choice in healthcare. It aims
to look at how decision makers such as doctors, purchasers of
healthcare services and patients make their choice from the
bewildering way of products and services that are associated with
healthcare under conditions of limited resources.</p>
<p>The increasing demographic pressure of the ageing population
and rising cost of technology are placing an increased emphasis
on health economics in assisting the rational use of healthcare
resources. This effect spills over into the pharmaceutical
industry where companies find themselves being increasingly
pressurised to provide health economic information for drugs and
products that they are introducing or establishing within the
pharmaceutical market place.</p>
<p>This trend is recognised within Corning Besselaar where there
is a commitment to providing high quality, timely, and
appropriate health economic studies, Corning Besselaar, together
with its sister companies, <a
href="http://www.bio.com/home/corning/companies.html">Corning HTA</a>
and <a href="pact.htm">Corning PACT</a> are able to provide the
full range of pharmaceutical economic services. These include:</p>
<h2><a href="phasei.htm"><u>Phase I</u></a></h2>
<p>The application of market assessments and epidemiological
tools to determine the strategic direction of drug programmes.</p>
<h2><a href="phaseii.htm"><u>Phase II</u></a></h2>
<p>The development of complex disease models to use as a basis
for the planning of Phase III and larger population studies.</p>
<h2><a href="edmc.htm"><u>Phase III</u></a></h2>
<p>The execution of health economic studies in parallel with the
Phase III development programme either incorporated within
traditional Phase Ill trials or as standalone health economic
studies.</p>
<h2><a href="pact.htm"><u>Phase IV</u></a></h2>
<p>The continuation of health economic studies into the real
world and naturalistic environment.</p>
<p>Corning Besselaar's strategy in providing health economics
studies, is to allow the pharmaceutical customers to purchase a
package of developments such that the introduction of
pharmacoeconomic and health economic studies can be controlled
and structured within the strategy of the development of
pharmaceutical compounds in today's changing environment.</p>
<p>Services offered by<a href="intro.htm"> Corning Besselaar</a>
are also sensitive to the current political pressures for cost
containment and a growing demand in society for a more
appropriate health care and the interests of the public in
improving the quality and opportunity for choice in healthcare
services. The experience and size of Coming Besselaar allows us
to deliver a high level of service at the stage of interaction
with the investigator site and the regulatory authorities.</p>
<p>This integrated range of services also extends beyond clinical
development into the communication of health economic health
studies within a wider audience. Therefore we are available to
conduct training seminars and exercises with field based
representatives and management staff, have the ability to produce
a wide range of papers and materials and can act as facilitators
with groups of diverse individuals for the description of the
factors important in the development of new compounds, e.g.
enlisting public perception.</p>
<p>The links with <a href="pact.htm">Coming PACT</a> and <a
href="http://www.bio.com/home/corning/companies.html">Corning HTA </a>provide
the services of Coming Besselaar with an instant access to over
twenty years of experience in health economics across the world.
In addition our European staff based in Maidenhead and Brussels
provide a range of experience with European decision-makers such
as the Transparency Commission in France and the District Health
Authorities in the UK. When linking this experience to our <a
href="regulato.htm">regulatory</a> colleagues, a powerful
grouping is formed which enables the speedy and appropriate
communication of health economics data to decision makers and
regulators.</p>
<p>In addition, the European group is very active in the
publications and education field. The recent publication of <strong>Health
Economics for the Uninitiated</strong> by Tony Lockett, one of
the team members within Corning Besselaar Health Economics is
more than testimony to this.</p>

<font size=5 color="#2F4F2F">The Individual Investment Account Act</font><br>
<font size=4>(S. 159 and H.R. 328)</font><br>
<hr width=50%>
This important, bipartisan legislation has been sponsored in the 104th Congress<br>
by Senator John Breaux and Representative Jim McCrery.  Briefly, this Act establishes accounts available to all taxpayers that would permit:<br> 
</center>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Unlimited tax deductions for all contributions.
<br>
<li>No penalty taxes nor forced distributions at any age.  Taxes are paid solely upon withdrawals.
<br>
<li>No income tax nor estate tax at death.  Beneficiary has benefactor's tax basis. (See Note A)
<br>
<li>Home Purchase/Sale Tax Deferred Rollovers (See Note B)
<br>
<li>Tax-deductible purchase of life insurance, provided the proceeds are added to the tax-deferred account.<br>
</ul>
<p>
Note A: With all withdrawals being taxed at ordinary income tax rates,
there is no rational need for income tax nor estate tax at death.
 The beneficiary can maintain the account and assumes the benefactor's
tax basis, if any.
<br><p>
Note B: Principal Residence Rollovers:<br>
<P>
Home Purchase:  up to $15,000-indexed for inflation-of otherwise
taxable distributions may be rolled over from the account without
tax for first purchase of principal residence.  However, the tax
basis of residence is reduced by like amount.
<br>
<P>
Home Sale:  proceeds from sale of a principal residence may be rolled over
into the investment account without tax.  The tax basis of the account is
thereupon adjusted to reflect the tax basis of former residence, plus the
existing law's $125,000 exemption on the home's sale after age 55.<br>

 1st Session 
 To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a deduction for 
 contributions to individual investment accounts, and for other 
 purposes. 
                    IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
                            January 4, 1995 
 Mr. McCrery introduced the following bill; which was referred to  
     the Committee on Ways and Means 
                                A BILL 
 To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a deduction for 
 contributions to individual investment accounts, and for other 
 purposes. 
   Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
 United States of America in Congress assembled, 
 SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
   This Act may be cited as the `Individual Investment Account Act  
 of 1993'. 
 SEC. 2. ESTABLISHMENT OF INDIVIDUAL INVESTMENT ACCOUNTS. 
   (a) In General: Part VII of subchapter B of chapter 1 of the 
 Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to additional itemized 
 deductions for individuals) is amended by redesignating section 220 
 as section 221 and by inserting after section 219 the following new 
 section: 
 `SEC. 220. INDIVIDUAL INVESTMENT ACCOUNTS. 
   `(a) Deduction Allowed: In the case of an individual, there shall 
 be allowed as a deduction an amount equal to the aggregate amount 
 paid in cash for the taxable year by such individual to an 
 individual investment account established for the benefit of such 
 individual. 
   `(b) Definitions and Special Rules: For purposes of this section-- 
       `(1) Individual investment account: The term `individual 
     investment account' means a trust created or organized in the 
     United States for the exclusive benefit of an individual, but 
     only if the written governing instrument creating the trust 
     meets the following requirements: 
           `(A) No contribution will be accepted unless it is in cash. 
           `(B) The trustee is a bank (as defined in section 408(n)) 
         or another person who demonstrates to the satisfaction of 
         the Secretary that the manner in which that person will 
         administer the trust will be consistent with the 
         requirements of this section. 
           `(C) No part of the trust assets will be invested in any 
         collectable (as defined in section 408(m)). 
           `(D) The assets of the trust will not be commingled with 
         other property except in a common trust fund or common 
         investment fund. 
       `(2) Time when contributions deemed made: A taxpayer shall be 
     deemed to have made a contribution on the last day of a taxable 
     year if the contribution is made on account of such taxable  
     year and is made not later than the time prescribed by law for 
     filing the return for such taxable year (not including 
     extensions thereof). 
   `(c) Tax Treatment of Distributions:  
       `(1) In general: Except as otherwise provided in this 
     subsection, any amount distributed out of an individual 
     investment account shall be included in gross income by the 
     distributee unless such amount is part of a qualified 1st-time 
     homebuyer distribution. 
       `(2) Qualified 1st-time homebuyer distribution: For purposes 
     of this subsection-- 
           `(A) In general: The term `qualified 1st-time homebuyer 
         distribution' means any payment or distribution received by 
         a 1st-time homebuyer from an individual investment account 
         to the extent such payment or distribution is used by the 
         individual within 60 days to pay qualified acquisition  
         costs with respect to a principal residence for such 
         individual. 
           `(B) Dollar limitation: The aggregate amount which may be 
         treated as qualified 1st-time homebuyer distributions for 
         all taxable years shall not exceed $15,000. 
           `(C) Basis reduction: The basis of any principal  
         residence described in subparagraph (A) shall be reduced by 
         the amount of any qualified 1st-time homebuyer distribution. 
           `(D) Definitions: For purposes of this paragraph-- 
               `(i) Qualified acquisition costs: The term `qualified 
             acquisition costs' means the costs of acquiring, 
             constructing, or reconstructing a residence. Such term 
             includes any usual or reasonable settlement, financing, 
             or other closing costs. 
               `(ii) 1st-time homebuyer: The term `1st-time 
             homebuyer' means any individual if such individual had 
             no present ownership interest in a principal residence 
             during the 3-year period ending on the date of 
             acquisition of the principal residence to which this 
             paragraph applies. 
               `(iii) Principal residence: The term `principal 
             residence' has the same meaning as when used in section 
             1034. 
       `(3) Transfer of account incident to divorce: The transfer of 
     an individual's interest in an individual investment account to 
     his former spouse under a divorce decree or under a written 
     instrument incident to a divorce shall not be considered a 
     taxable transfer made by such individual notwithstanding any 
     other provision of this subtitle, and such interest at the time 
     of the transfer shall be treated as an individual investment 
     account of such spouse and not of such individual. Thereafter 
     such account shall be treated, for purposes of this subtitle,  
     as maintained for the benefit of such spouse. 
   `(d) Tax Treatment of Accounts:  
       `(1) Exemption from tax: An individual investment account 
     shall be exempt from taxation under this subtitle unless such 
     account has ceased to be such an account by reason of paragraph 
     (2). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, any such account 
     shall be subject to the taxes imposed by section 511 (relating 
     to imposition of tax on unrelated business income of  
     charitable, etc. organizations). 
       `(2) Loss of exemption of account where individual engages in 
     prohibited transaction: 
           `(A) In general: If, during any taxable year of the 
         individual for whose benefit the individual investment 
         account is established, that individual engages in any 
         transaction prohibited by section 4975 with respect to the 
         account, the account shall cease to be an individual 
         investment account as of the first day of that taxable year. 
           `(B) Account treated as distributing all its assets: In 
         any case in which any account ceases to be an individual 
         investment account by reason of subparagraph (A) on the 
         first day of any taxable year, paragraph (1) of subsection 
         (c) shall be applied as if there were a distribution on  
         such first day in an amount equal to the fair market value 
         (on such first day) of all assets in the account (on such 
         first day). 
       `(3) Effect of pledging account as security: If, during any 
     taxable year, an individual for whose benefit an individual 
     investment account is established uses the account or any 
     portion thereof as security for a loan, the portion so used 
     shall be treated as distributed to that individual. 
       `(4) Rollover contributions: Paragraph (1) shall not apply to 
     any amount paid or distributed out of an individual investment 
     account to the individual for whose benefit the account is 
     maintained if such amount is paid into another individual 
     investment account for the benefit of such individual not later 
     than the 60th day after the day on which he receives the  
     payment or distribution. 
   `(e) Cost-of-Living Adjustment:  
       `(1) In general: In the case of any taxable year beginning in 
     a calendar year after 1992, the dollar amount contained in 
     subsection (c)(2)(B) shall be increased by an amount equal to-- 
           `(A) such dollar amount, multiplied by 
           `(B) the cost-of-living adjustment determined under 
         section 1(f)(3) for the calendar year in which the taxable 
         year begins. 
       `(2) Rounding: If any dollar amount (as increased under 
     paragraph (1)) is not a multiple of $10, such dollar amount 
     shall be increased to nearest multiple of $10 (or, if such 
     dollar amount is a multiple of $5 and not of $10, such dollar 
     amount shall be increased to next higher multiple of $10). 
   `(f) Custodial Accounts: For purposes of this section, a  
 custodial account shall be treated as a trust if the assets of such 
 account are held by a bank (as defined in section 408(n)) or  
 another person who demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the 
 Secretary, that the manner in which he will administer the account 
 will be consistent with the requirements of this section, and if  
 the custodial account would, except for the fact that it is not a 
 trust, constitute an individual investment account described in 
 subsection (b). For purposes of this title, in the case of a 
 custodial account treated as a trust by reason of the preceding 
 sentence, the custodian of such account shall be treated as the 
 trustee thereof. 
   `(g) Reports: The trustee of an individual investment account 
 shall make such reports regarding such account to the Secretary and 
 to the individual for whose benefit the account is maintained with 
 respect to contributions, distributions, and such other matters as 
 the Secretary may require under regulations. The reports required  
 by this subsection shall be filed at such time and in such manner 
 and furnished to such individuals at such time and in such manner  
 as may be required by those regulations.' 
   (b) Deduction Allowed in Arriving at Adjusted Gross Income: 
 Subsection (a) of section 62 of such Code (defining adjusted gross 
 income) is amended by inserting after paragraph (15) the following 
 new paragraph: 
       `(16) Individual investment account contributions: The 
     deduction allowed by section 220 (relating to individual 
     investment accounts).' 
   (c) Individual Investment Accounts Exempt From Estate Tax: Part 
 III of subchapter A of chapter 11 of such Code is amended by 
 redesignating section 2046 as section 2047 and by inserting after 
 section 2045 the following new section: 
 `SEC. 2046. INDIVIDUAL INVESTMENT ACCOUNTS. 
   `Notwithstanding any other provision of law, there shall be 
 excluded from the value of the gross estate of the value of any 
 individual investment account (as defined in section 220(b)). 
 Section 1014 shall not apply to such accounts.' 
   (d) Nonrecognition of Gain on Sale of Principal Residence Where 
 Amount Equal to Otherwise Taxable Gain Deposited Into Individual 
 Investment Account: Part III of subchapter B of chapter 1 of such 
 Code is amended by inserting after section 121 the following new 
 section:

                   REINVESTMENT IN INDIVIDUAL INVESTMENT ACCOUNT. 
   `(a) General Rule: Gross income does not include gain from the 
 sale or exchange of property if, during the 5-year period ending on 
 the date of the sale or exchange, such property has been owned and 
 used by the taxpayer as his principal residence for periods 
 aggregating 3 years or more. 
   `(b) Limitation: The amount of gain excluded from gross income 
 under subsection (a) shall not exceed the amount paid in cash 
 (during the 1-year period beginning on the date of the sale or 
 exchange) to an individual investment account (as defined in  
 section 220(b)) established for the benefit of the taxpayer or his 
 spouse. 
   `(c) Certain Rules On Ownership and Use To Apply: Rules similar  
 to the rules of section 121(d) shall apply for purposes of 
 determining ownership and use under this section.' 
   (e) Tax on Prohibited Transactions: Section 4975 of such Code 
 (relating to prohibited transactions) is amended-- 
       (1) by adding at the end of subsection (c) the following new 
     paragraph: 
       `(4) Special rule for individual investment accounts: An 
     individual for whose benefit an individual investment account  
     is established shall be exempt from the tax imposed by this 
     section with respect to any transaction concerning such account 
     (which would otherwise be taxable under this section) if, with 
     respect to such transaction, the account ceases to be an 
     individual investment account by reason of the application of 
     section 220(d)(2)(A) to such account.'; and 
       (2) by inserting `or an individual investment account 
     described in section 220(b)' in subsection (e)(1) after 
     `described in section 408(a)'.

       (2) by adding at the end of subsection (a) the following:

     regarding an individual investment account at the time and in 
     the manner required by such section shall pay a penalty of $50 
     for each failure unless it is shown that such failure is due to 
     reasonable cause.' 
   (g) Adjustment of Basis of Residence Acquired Through Use of 
 Account: Subsection (a) of section 1016 of such Code is amended by 
 striking `and' at the end of paragraph (24), by striking the period 
 at the end of paragraph (25) and inserting `; and', and by adding

1st Session 
To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a deduction for 
contributions to individual investment accounts, and for other 
purposes. 
                 IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES 
                           January 5, 1995 
Mr. Breaux introduced the following bill; which was read twice and 
    referred to the Committee on Finance 
                               A BILL 
To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a deduction for 
contributions to individual investment accounts, and for other 
purposes. 
  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
  This Act may be cited as the `Individual Investment Account Act  
of 1995'. 
SEC. 2. ESTABLISHMENT OF INDIVIDUAL INVESTMENT ACCOUNTS. 
  (a) In General: Part VII of subchapter B of chapter 1 of the 
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to additional itemized 
deductions for individuals) is amended by redesignating section 220 
as section 221 and by inserting after section 219 the following new 
section: 
`SEC. 220. INDIVIDUAL INVESTMENT ACCOUNTS. 
  `(a) Deduction Allowed: In the case of an individual, there shall 
be allowed as a deduction an amount equal to the aggregate amount 
paid in cash for the taxable year by such individual to an 
individual investment account established for the benefit of such 
individual. 
  `(b) Definitions and Special Rules: For purposes of this section-- 
      `(1) Individual investment account: The term `individual 
    investment account' means a trust created or organized in the 
    United States for the exclusive benefit of an individual, but 
    only if the written governing instrument creating the trust 
    meets the following requirements: 
          `(A) No contribution will be accepted unless it is in cash. 
          `(B) The trustee is a bank (as defined in section 408(n)) 
        or another person who demonstrates to the satisfaction of 
        the Secretary that the manner in which that person will 
        administer the trust will be consistent with the 
        requirements of this section. 
          `(C) No part of the trust assets will be invested in any 
        collectible (as defined in section 408(m)). 
          `(D) The assets of the trust will not be commingled with 
        other property except in a common trust fund or common 
        investment fund. 
      `(2) Time when contributions deemed made: A taxpayer shall be 
    deemed to have made a contribution on the last day of a taxable 
    year if the contribution is made on account of such taxable  
    year and is made not later than the time prescribed by law for 
    filing the return for such taxable year (not including 
    extensions thereof). 
  `(c) Tax Treatment of Distributions:  
      `(1) In general: Except as otherwise provided in this 
    subsection, any amount distributed out of an individual 
    investment account shall be included in gross income by the 
    distributee unless such amount is part of a qualified 1st-time 
    homebuyer distribution. 
      `(2) Qualified 1st-time homebuyer distribution: For purposes 
    of this subsection-- 
          `(A) In general: The term `qualified 1st-time homebuyer 
        distribution' means any payment or distribution received by 
        a 1st-time homebuyer from an individual investment account 
        to the extent such payment or distribution is used by the 
        individual within 60 days to pay qualified acquisition  
        costs with respect to a principal residence for such 
        individual. 
          `(B) Dollar limitation: The aggregate amount which may be 
        treated as qualified 1st-time homebuyer distributions for 
        all taxable years shall not exceed $15,000. 
          `(C) Basis reduction: The basis of any principal  
        residence described in subparagraph (A) shall be reduced by 
        the amount of any qualified 1st-time homebuyer distribution. 
          `(D) Definitions: For purposes of this paragraph-- 
              `(i) Qualified acquisition costs: The term `qualified 
            acquisition costs' means the costs of acquiring, 
            constructing, or reconstructing a residence. Such term 
            includes any usual or reasonable settlement, financing, 
            or other closing costs. 
              `(ii) 1st-time homebuyer: The term `1st-time 
            homebuyer' means any individual if such individual had 
            no present ownership interest in a principal residence 
            during the 3-year period ending on the date of 
            acquisition of the principal residence to which this 
            paragraph applies. 
              `(iii) Principal residence: The term `principal 
            residence' has the same meaning as when used in section 
            1034. 
      `(3) Transfer of account incident to divorce: The transfer of 
    an individual's interest in an individual investment account to 
    his former spouse under a divorce decree or under a written 
    instrument incident to a divorce shall not be considered a 
    taxable transfer made by such individual notwithstanding any 
    other provision of this subtitle, and such interest at the time 
    of the transfer shall be treated as an individual investment 
    account of such spouse and not of such individual. Thereafter 
    such account shall be treated, for purposes of this subtitle,  
    as maintained for the benefit of such spouse. 
  `(d) Tax Treatment of Accounts:  
      `(1) Exemption from tax: An individual investment account 
    shall be exempt from taxation under this subtitle unless such 
    account has ceased to be such an account by reason of paragraph 
    (2). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, any such account 
    shall be subject to the taxes imposed by section 511 (relating 
    to imposition of tax on unrelated business income of  
    charitable, etc. organizations). 
      `(2) Loss of exemption of account where individual engages in 
    prohibited transaction: 
          `(A) In general: If, during any taxable year of the 
        individual for whose benefit the individual investment 
        account is established, that individual engages in any 
        transaction prohibited by section 4975 with respect to the 
        account, the account shall cease to be an individual 
        investment account as of the first day of that taxable year. 
          `(B) Account treated as distributing all its assets: In 
        any case in which any account ceases to be an individual 
        investment account by reason of subparagraph (A) on the 
        first day of any taxable year, paragraph (1) of subsection 
        (c) shall be applied as if there were a distribution on  
        such first day in an amount equal to the fair market value 
        (on such first day) of all assets in the account (on such 
        first day). 
      `(3) Effect of pledging account as security: If, during any 
    taxable year, an individual for whose benefit an individual 
    investment account is established uses the account or any 
    portion thereof as security for a loan, the portion so used 
    shall be treated as distributed to that individual. 
      `(4) Rollover contributions: Paragraph (1) shall not apply to 
    any amount paid or distributed out of an individual investment 
    account to the individual for whose benefit the account is 
    maintained if such amount is paid into another individual 
    investment account for the benefit of such individual not later 
    than the 60th day after the day on which he receives the  
    payment or distribution. 
  `(e) Cost-of-Living Adjustment:  
      `(1) In general: In the case of any taxable year beginning in 
    a calendar year after 1994, the dollar amount contained in 
    subsection (c)(2)(B) shall be increased by an amount equal to-- 
          `(A) such dollar amount, multiplied by 
          `(B) the cost-of-living adjustment determined under 
        section 1(f)(3) for the calendar year in which the taxable 
        year begins, by substituting `1994' for `1989' in 
        subparagraph (B) thereof. 
      `(2) Rounding: If any dollar amount (as increased under 
    paragraph (1)) is not a multiple of $10, such dollar amount 
    shall be increased to nearest multiple of $10 (or, if such 
    dollar amount is a multiple of $5 and not of $10, such dollar 
    amount shall be increased to next higher multiple of $10). 
  `(f) Custodial Accounts: For purposes of this section, a  
custodial account shall be treated as a trust if the assets of such 
account are held by a bank (as defined in section 408(n)) or  
another person who demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the 
Secretary, that the manner in which he will administer the account 
will be consistent with the requirements of this section, and if  
the custodial account would, except for the fact that it is not a 
trust, constitute an individual investment account described in 
subsection (b). For purposes of this title, in the case of a 
custodial account treated as a trust by reason of the preceding 
sentence, the custodian of such account shall be treated as the 
trustee thereof. 
  `(g) Reports: The trustee of an individual investment account 
shall make such reports regarding such account to the Secretary and 
to the individual for whose benefit the account is maintained with 
respect to contributions, distributions, and such other matters as 
the Secretary may require under regulations. The reports required  
by this subsection shall be filed at such time and in such manner 
and furnished to such individuals at such time and in such manner  
as may be required by those regulations.' 
  (b) Deduction Allowed in Arriving at Adjusted Gross Income: 
Subsection (a) of section 62 of such Code (defining adjusted gross 
income) is amended by adding at the end thereof the following new 
paragraph: 
      `(14) Individual investment account contributions: The 
    deduction allowed by section 220 (relating to individual 
    investment accounts).' 
  (c) Individual Investment Accounts Exempt From Estate Tax: Part 
III of subchapter A of chapter 11 of such Code is amended by 
redesignating section 2046 as section 2047 and by inserting after

`SEC. 2046. INDIVIDUAL INVESTMENT ACCOUNTS. 
  `Notwithstanding any other provision of law, there shall be 
excluded from the value of the gross estate of the value of any 
individual investment account (as defined in section 220(b)). 
Section 1014 shall not apply to such accounts.' 
  (d) Nonrecognition of Gain on Sale of Principal Residence Where 
Amount Equal to Otherwise Taxable Gain Deposited Into Individual 
Investment Account: Part III of subchapter B of chapter 1 of such 
Code is amended by inserting after section 121 the following new

sale or exchange of property if, during the 5-year period ending on 
the date of the sale or exchange, such property has been owned and 
used by the taxpayer as his principal residence for periods 
aggregating 3 years or more. 
  `(b) Limitation: The amount of gain excluded from gross income 
under subsection (a) shall not exceed the amount paid in cash 
(during the 1-year period beginning on the date of the sale or 
exchange) to an individual investment account (as defined in  
section 220(b)) established for the benefit of the taxpayer or his 
spouse. 
  `(c) Certain Rules On Ownership and Use To Apply: Rules similar  
to the rules of section 121(d) shall apply for purposes of 
determining ownership and use under this section.'

    individual for whose benefit an individual investment account  
    is established shall be exempt from the tax imposed by this

    (which would otherwise be taxable under this section) if, with 
    respect to such transaction, the account ceases to be an 
    individual investment account by reason of the application of 
    section 220(d)(2)(A) to such account.'; and 
      (2) by inserting `or an individual investment account

<P>
Dear Colleague:
<P>
I have re-introduced the Individual Investment Account Act-H.R.
328 in the 104th Congress-to make long overdue improvements to
our tax law to boost personal savings.
<P>
This legislation provides for unlimited tax deductions for IRA-type
savings, tax-deferred earnings growth, no penalty tax, no forced
distribution at any age, and no income tax or estate tax at death.
 Ordinary income taxes are paid solely when withdrawals take place
from the Investment Account into the first purchase of a principal
residence and the tax-free roll-over into the Investment Account
of the proceeds from the sale of a principal residence.
<P>
As we all know, personal savings is far too low for our nation's
economy to achieve robust economic growth and increased national
wealth.  A major impeding factor is the senseless &quot;double
tax&quot; on savings imposed by the ordinary income tax.  Under
the &quot;double tax,&quot; personal income is first taxed when
earned.  Then, if the resulting post-tax disposable income is
used for consumption of goods and services, no further federal
income taxes are imposed.  If the income is saved, the earnings
that accrue to the savings are taxed again.  Thus, the cost of
saving is higher than the cost of consumption-a policy which needlessly
restricts both savings and growth.
<P>
I believe the differential in the tax treatment of savings vs.
consumption can best be resolved by creating a universal, unlimited,
tax-deductible, IRA-type plan as provided in H.R. 328.  This bill
removes the income tax's recognized bias against saving.  I urge
you to read the article on this plan written by syndicated columnist
Donald Lambro and provided on the back of this Dear Colleague.
 (H.R. 3179 of the 103rd Congress is identical to H.R. 328.)
<P>
If you are interested in encouraging savings and promoting economic
growth, please call Heather Hanson of my staff (x52777) to join
me as a cosponsor of H.R. 328.
<P>
Sincerely,<p>

<title>Letter from John Breaux</title>

<pre>
Dear Colleague: <p>

As you well know, we in Congress have been deeply concerned about the very
low level of saving within the United States.  As a result, there have
been many bills introduced in this 104th Congress to increase personal
saving.  A number of Senators have cosponsored more than one. 

<p>

In addressing this vital need to increase household saving, and the
related tax revenue impact arising therefrom, it is important to recognize
a position that is widely accepted by economists:  the ordinary income tax
is biased against savings and favors consumption.  Thus, the only
remaining questions are:  how bad is the bias; how can we correct it; is
the government's tax revenue impacted; and what are the economic losses or
gains from change? 

<p>

This letter applies to a bill I have sponsored, S. 159.  This legislation
is unique in a number of ways, Most importantly, S. 159 totally removes
the income tax bias against personal saving in a simple, sound way.  My
legislation would permit unlimited tax deductible contributions to
Individual Investment Accounts (IIAs) by all taxpayers. 

<p>

Please review the enclosed summary of S. 159 and article by the Institute
for Research on the Economics of Taxation (IRET) which describes S. 159 as
&quot;...one of the boldest, most imaginative, and most constructive
pro-growth tax initiatives in many years.&quot; 

<p>

I hope that you will join me in this effort by cosponsoring S. 159. 
Please contact Geoff Culbertson (4-4623) for any additional information. 

                                      Sincerely, 


                                      JOHN BREAUX

<P>
&quot;The right to pursue personal liberty, opportunity and economic prosperity is the promise of America.  To create new jobs and increase the standard of living for all, we must relieve the punitive tax burden on productive Americans who invest in their fellow men.  Tragically, the existing U.S. tax code penalizes this investment and thereby forestalls economic growth.<br> 
<p>
The Individual Investment Account (IIA) Act corrects this serious flaw - attacks code which has increasingly robbed America of greater GDP growth, new jobs, increased living standards, and even government tax receipts.<br>
<p>
Succinctly, IIAs allow unlimited, fully tax-deductible contributions to IRA-type accounts.  All investment activity is tax free until withdrawn by the saver or beneficiary, thereby eliminating redundant taxation on the same capital.  With IIAs, there are no penalty taxes, no forced distributions, nor estate taxes.<br>
<p>
This common sense bipartisan legislation is the springboard to an American economic renaissance.  All members of Congress, and their constituents, should actively urge its enactment.&quot;<br>

<P>
&quot;America's small business is the powerful economic engine that innovates, creates jobs and spurs economic growth.  The vital fuel for this engine is capital.  Capital is derived from the accumulated and ongoing savings and investments of people.  In fact, there is no other source.<br>
<p>
The existing income tax as applied to personal saving and investing is severely biased against saving and investing.  The effect of this nonsensical bias compounds over time thereby progressively curtailing all economic growth -- and particularly so the job creating growth of small businesses and entrepreneurs.<br>
<p>
The Individual Investment Account Act simply and effectively strips away this tax bias against saving and investing.  IIAs are IRA-type plans that allow each person to contribute unlimited, fully tax-deductible amounts.  Investment activity accumulates tax free until withdrawn by the owner or the beneficiary.  There are no penalty taxes, or forced distributions, nor estate taxes upon death.<br>

<P>
No country can grow and prosper without a healthy savings rate.  There is a very simple way to raise savings and investment in America.  It is to remove the tax bias against savings by allowing taxpayers unlimited annual contributions to IRA-type plans.<br>
<p>
Several reputable studies have shown conclusively that IRAs in their current form increase personal savings. Removing the caps and expanding the eligibility for tax deductible saving could double America's savings rate overnight.&quot;<br>

<P>
&quot;The ACCF supports IRA-type plans such as those in this Act as a way of encouraging the savings necessary for increased investment.  High levels of investment, particularly in productive equipment, is a key element in increasing U.S. economic growth.  S. 159 and H.R. 328, which provide an unlimited tax deduction for saving and eliminate penalty taxes and forced distributions, could make a significant contribution to our economic future.&quot;<br>

<P>
&quot;As has long been recognized, the United States suffers from a low level of new capital formation which in turn has depressed economic growth.  This lack of capital formation is mainly a result of the U.S. tax code being far more biased against productive saving and investment than our foreign competitors face in their tax laws.  Senator John Breaux and Representative Jim McCrery propose to eliminate much of this tax bias [via the] Individual Investment Account Act, which would establish universal, unlimited, tax deductible IRA-type plans.<br>
<p>
Those members of Congress who are truly committed to reigniting economic growth in America, creating millions of productive new jobs, and reducing poverty and increasing economic opportunity and prosperity, will support this needed legislation.<br>
<p>
There will be those who say it will favor the rich, but they will ignore the fact that a rich man can only benefit from the legislation by productively investing his money and refraining from consumption.  As a result, this investment will create jobs for poor men.<br>
<p>
There will be those who say this legislation will add to the federal deficit.  Such an argument ignores the reality that the federal deficit is in large part a result of too little economic growth, and of increased demand for government support by people without jobs or economic opportunity.  Expanding IRA-type plans over the long run will reduce the federal deficit by increasing jobs, total wage payments, and payroll taxes, and diminishing the need for government payments as a result of expanded economic opportunity.&quot;<br>

Why It's So Hard To Save<br>
<p>
</font>
<b>By Edwin Feulner<br></b>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As any economist can tell you, when you subsidize something, you get more of it.  Give welfare checks to people who don't work, for example, and the number of people who don't work increases.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The flip side is equally clear: if you tax something, you get less of it.  For example, a few years back the government slapped a &quot;luxury&quot; tax on cabin cruisers and yachts costing more than $100,000.  The result: Boat buyers decided not to buy new boats, and several U.S. boat builders went belly up -- throwing their workers into the unemployment line.
<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Which brings me to the point: Just as taxes on new boats kill demand for new boats, taxes on savings lead Americans to save less.  Go ahead, try to squirrel away a few dollars for a rainy day (or a sunny day in Florida or Arizona when you retire).  The government will thwart you at every turn, taxing your savings more heavily than just about anything else in the economy.
<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Think about it: Assume you take $1,000 and put it in a certificate of deposit earning 5 percent.  After one year, you've earned $50.  Now, you already paid steep federal income taxes on that original $1,000 (between 15 percent and 39 percent) when you earned it.  But that's not enough.  The government taxes your modest $50 gain too, leaving only $30.50 in your pocket if you're in the highest tax bracket.
<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Welcome to the tax code: You're taxed when you work for your money, and you're taxed again when your money works for you.  It's one of the worst features of our tax system, taxing people twice on money they're trying to save.
<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
About the only way to get some relief from this double tax burden is through Individual Retirement Accounts (IRA's), which let you sock away a few dollars and have the money earn interest tax-free.
<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But IRAs have their limits, the worst being that the government only lets you contribute $2,000 per year.  The government also slaps you with a steep penalty if you withdraw the money before Uncle Sam says you can (currently age 59-and-a-half), so forget about using the money to buy a home or cope with a financial emergency.  And don't think you can pass the money in your IRA on to your children without going another few rounds with the tax man.  The government forces you to start withdrawing the money at age 70-and-a-half so it can collect income taxes again.  Then when you die, the money falls prey to estate taxes and, when your children finally receive what's leftover, inheritance taxes.
<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Alas, that's Washington: It takes a good idea like saving money -- which provides the capital to grow the economy and create jobs -- and piles on so many regulations, penalties, and layers of taxation that saving hardly becomes worth the effort.  If there's so little reward for thriftiness, why not spend, spend, spend?
<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There's a better way.  A proposal by Tom Kelly, president of the Savers &amp; Investors League of Villanova, Pa., would eliminate the red tape and double taxation that makes saving so hard.  IRAs?  In Kelly's view, they're at best a good start.  He proposes Individual Investment Accounts, a more muscular savings tool that would let you deposit as much of your money as you want tax free (no $2,000 limit), withdraw it for any purpose (hello new house), withdraw it at any age (early retirement anyone?), and let you pass it on to your children with no inheritance or estate taxes (sorry Uncle Sam, my kids come first).
<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It's not a hard concept to grasp: If you want people to save more, you have to tax their savings less.  So no more preaching from politicians about our low national savings rate until they do for savers what they've already done for yacht buyers.

<BLOCKQUOTE>GOP candidate Bob Dole's tax plan has put tax policy squarely at the forefront of the presidential debate this year, but as far as Tom Kelly is concerned, the plan doesn't go far enough.  Kelly, the ebullient founder and president of the Savers and Investor League (SIL), says that &quot;it is a step in the right direction,&quot; but complains that it &quot;doesn't touch the entire question of taxing savings.&quot;<BR>
<P>
&quot;Reducing the income tax on investment return by 15% is certainly an improvement, but is far short of the proper tax reduction of 100%,&quot; says Kelly.  After you have had your wage or salary income taxed once, he observes, &quot;whatever you have left can only be spent or saved.&quot;  If you save it, he argues, the government will continually tax it, penalizing and discouraging savings.  The result, he maintains, is that &quot;the American people are being ripped off.  People ask, 'Why aren't young people saving?'  Well, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure that one out.&quot;<BR>
<P>
According to Kelly, &quot;All of your savings and investments should be tax deductible and tax deferred.&quot;  Accumulating wealth in the form of either savings or investments, Kelly says, &quot;is the only way to become self-sufficient.  Penalizing savings takes away our self-sufficiency.&quot;<BR>
<P>
The Savers and Investors League lobbies Congress to change the antisavings bias of the tax code, while its affiliated Savers &amp; Investors Foundation carries out research on the impact of taxes on the American economy, taxpayers and government.  The mission of SIL, says Kelly, is to &quot;educate and motivate grassroots voters/taxpayers to challenge and change the way our government measures the tax revenue impact of tax-deferred savings.&quot;<BR>
<P>
A self-described &quot;entrepreneurial businessman,&quot; Kelly founded SIL in 1988 after a run-in with government destroyed his investment business.  &quot;This is not my vocation.  It's a labor of love, believe me.  I refuse to accept the notion that our government and our people can let this happen.&quot;<BR>
<P>
Kelly had been in business 15 years selling policyowner self-directed variable annuities when the IRS and Treasury Department obtained a court ruling overturning 70 previous rulings favorable to firms such as Kelly's and shut it down.  Kelly sued, and the U.S. District Court agreed with him, stating that the Treasury and IRS rulings were in fact arbitrary, capricious, illegal, and unreasonable and that the IRS had usurped the power of Congress.<BR>
<P>
In response to an IRS-Treasury petition, the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled, as technical matter and not on the substance of the suit, that the District Court did not have jurisdiction and overturned its decision.  Kelly hired Robert Bork, then a Yale Law School professor, to assist with his appeal to the Supreme Court, but, without stating its reasons, the Supreme Court refused to accept the case.  Thus, the Treasury and IRS won - but not on the merits of their tax law position - and Kelly was forced to liquidate his business in 1978.<BR>
<P>
This experience prompted Kelly to become an activist and after studying up on the matter, Kelly &quot;concluded that the way our nation taxes savings is absolutely, flat-out stupid.&quot;  The current mode of taxing, he argues, &quot;not only kills the accumulated capital and savings of individuals and collectively, our nation, it also kills the tax base of our government, and the government collects less taxes than they otherwise would...  Our nation has lost trillions and trillions of dollars of economic growth because of it.&quot;<BR>
<P>
Kelly does not fault legislators, who are not economists, for failing to understand the economics involved, but thinks that once tax policy got off track, precedent and habit kept it there.  He lays partial blame on accounting practices that began with the Budget Act of 1974, which basically assumes that all money somehow belongs to the government and that failure to tax any existing account, such as personal savings, is a government &quot;tax-expenditure.&quot;<BR>
<P>
As a result, says Kelly, government tax policy views allowing individuals to keep and save their own money as a subsidy.  &quotThis is 100% wrong!&quot; he says.<BR>
<P>
Observing that all the other major economic powers largely exempt savings and capital gains from taxation, Kelly sees his efforts beginning to bear fruit here as well.  SIL test mailings have shown tremendous popular support for the idea of tax-deferred savings, Kelly says, and &quot;we have a bill [H.R. 328 and S. 159] introduced, with very good sponsorship in Congress.  It's sponsored by John Breaux [D. - La.] in the Senate and Jim McCreary [R. - La.] in the House, and has a lot of support.  Dick Armey [R. - Tex.], who's an economist, is a cosponsor.&quot;<BR>
<P>
&quot;This whole taxation of savings question is right on the front burner,&quot; says Kelly, noting that all major tax proposals now include some form of totally tax-exempt savings, including The USA Tax Act (S. 722) sponsored by Senators Pete Domenici [R. - N.M.] and Sam Nunn [D. - Ga.].  &quot;I believe it's just like the Berlin Wall.  No one thought the Berlin Wall would ever come down, but because it was built on quicksand - poof! - the whole thing imploded, and the wall came down.  The same thing's going to happen with the way our nation taxes savings.&quot;<BR>

<FONT SIZE=4>They Might Help But They Aren't Sufficient</FONT><BR>
</CENTER>
<P>
Washington, D.C., August 7, 1996 - U.S. savers and investors, individually and collectively, suffer under an oppressive tax system; one that doubles, triples and quadruples the taxes applied to the same investment return or gain.  Whoever labeled investment return or gain as &quot;unearned income&quot; had to have a sinister sense of humor.  Securing a reasonable income from saving and investing is not an easy task, and is one that calls for eternal vigilance.
<P>
Reducing the income tax on investment return by 15% is certainly an improvement but is far short of the proper tax reduction of 100%.  After you have had your wage or salary income taxed, whatever you have left can only be spent or saved.  If you spend it there is no investment income for Uncle Sam to tax year after year thereafter.  If you save it, you are creating economic growth for yourself and everyone else - including the government.  It is this added economic growth, derived solely from increased saving, that creates more jobs, and more production at lower costs, and higher standards of living for everyone - including the saver.  All of this expanded economic activity also creates more tax dollars for Uncle Sam than otherwise collected under the annual income tax as applied to saving.
<P>
You don't have to be a rocket scientist to accept the fact that eliminating the tax on saving will increase our peoples rate of saving significantly.
<P>
Is it any wonder all economists recognize the existing inherent tax bias against saving.  A 15% reduction in that bias against investment income is only a small step in the right direction.

<i>The Right Tax Plan For Dole</i></font><br>
By VICTOR A. CANTO<br>
</center>
<blockquote>
<p>
Less than a month before the Republican Convention, Bob Dole has yet to present a tax-cut plan.  Why?  Most likely because he hasn't seen one he likes.  The answer may be an unlimited, front-loaded individual retirement account.
<p>
Everyone expects a Republican candidate to set down a tax-cut plan.  And, aside from naming a running mate, a tax cut is Dole's best chance for a fresh, strong appeal to the voters.  But he needs a plan that makes economic sense, wins support within his party and in the country at large and also fits with the Dole we all know.
<p>
The right IRA reforms fill that bill.  They would open a new opportunity for all Americans to save, boosting our national rates of saving and investing, and thus economic growth.  The plan would promote economic efficiency by taxing each economic transaction only once and by end-running the job-killing capital gains tax.
<p>
Early in the campaign, Dole commissioned a group headed by Jack Kemp to draw up a tax plan for the future.  Kemp landed on a refined version of the Hall-Rabushka flat tax.  Dole balked at that, though he has supported a flatter tax structure over the years.
<p>
Kemp then threw his support to Steve Forbes, who based his surprisingly successful campaign on the flat tax.  But when Forbes left the race, so too did the flat tax.
<p>
An unlimited, front-loaded IRA plan can reap some of the benefits of a flat tax - but has stronger political &quot;wings.&quot  It would increase our nation's savings rate and also free up cash trapped in slow-performing investments.
<p>
Current law limits each of us to a maximum IRA contribution of $2,000 a year.  Income taxes don't apply to the money paid into the fund, but do to the money withdrawn from it.
<p>
The $2,000 limit is an arbitrary figure.  Raising it - increasing the chance for tax-deferred investment - would likely boost our national savings rate, which many analysts say is too low.  Removing the limit altogether should boost the savings rate considerably.
<p>
But IRAs are limited for a reason: the fear that, given the chance, too many people would defer too many taxes for too many years.  The loss of tax revenues, though temporary, would seem to increase the federal budget deficit.
<p>
We can solve that problem by front-loading the IRA - by taxing money as it goes into the fund, not as it is withdrawn.
<p>
Think of the tax on IRAs as a sales tax - a tax that is levied when people spend money, rather than when they earn it.  A tax imposed at the end of the time of possession is said to be &quot;back-loaded.&quot;
<p>
A front-loaded tax, by contrast, resembles an income tax, levied when people earn money.  The tax is levied as money is placed into the account, not when it is removed.
<p>
The two taxes generate equivalent amounts of revenue for the government - but the timing of the actual tax receipts is quite different.  Front-loading generates revenue sooner, back-loading later.
<p>
Either way, the program delivers the same amount to the saver at retirement.
<p>
The government could generate extra tax revenues by adding one more twist: allowing all current IRA holders to convert their accounts to the new program.  this would generate a one-time revenue windfall.
<p>
The unlimited, front-loaded IRA indirectly addresses another issue dear to Republican hearts; the capital gains tax.
<p>
The plan adheres to the single taxation philosophy.  Under it, all income earned on the IRA would be tax-free.  The sale of assets in the account would also be tax-free, provided the proceeds are reinvested in the IRA.
<p>
The unlimited IRA is a way to prospectively unlock capital gains and allow for a more efficient resource allocation.  And the &quot;front-loading&quot; feature avoids the need to index gains for inflation, because gains within the retirement account would be liquidated without additional taxes.
<p>
In short, the unlimited, front-loaded IRA provides a way to defuse the capital gains issue, while delivering most of the benefits of single taxation and indexation.
<p>
In is also a way to help each American save for his or her own retirement - a cause Bob Dole can support with real enthusiasm.

<font size=6>Is a Balanced Budget the Key to<br>
Our Economic Future?<br>
</font>
<b>by CHARLES I. PLOSSER</b>
</center>
<hr>
<p>
I am probably not much different from most of you when I say that I listened - first with interest, then with laughter, and finally with complete dismay - to the verbal sparring among supposedly bright and able politicians during the recent budget debates.
<p>
<ul>
<li> Why must we be subjected to all the nonsensical and misleading posturing intended to gain support in the overnight opinion surveys by pitting one interest group against another?
<p>
<li> Why does the Secretary of the Treasury incite the fear of default on U.S. debt obligations when he knows fully well that there is no immediate threat?
<p>
<li> Why should members of Congress take the ludicrous stand that the budget must be balanced in seven years - not six, eight, or none, but seven and only seven years?
</ul>
...
<p>
If you could cut through all of the political grandstanding and use of the media to pander to specific interest groups, you would find, of course, claims that important philosophical issues are at stake.  These issues involve fundamental questions over the role and size of government and the structure of the tax system.  Indeed, that is where the real issues lie.
<p>
Unfortunately, these important questions are unlikely to be resolved or to dramatically change the way government affects the allocation of resources during the current Congress.  The very nature  of the legislative process, which entails compromise and a strong preference for the status quo, makes progress difficult and slow.  Instead, the Congress, Administration and policy gurus have, as a practical matter, chosen to make the budget deficit the focal point for the debate.
<p>
...
<p>
Attempting to reduce the deficit, of course, leads to a debate over the nature of the spending reductions and/or tax changes required to accomplish this goal.  The real danger of making deficit reduction the yardstick by which we measure the success of the budget process is that we may succeed in reducing the deficit, but not in resolving the more fundamental problems.
<p>
...
<p>
If I asked a group of Americans why they thought the budget deficit was a problem, I would get a variety of different answers.  But I think a common thread in their answers would be a concern over the health of our economy and the fear that our current high standard of living is likely to be at the expense of not just our own future, but that of our children and generations to come.
<p>
This is a real and justifiable concern.  But the fact is that even if we eliminate the budget deficit - however good that may make us feel - we will not necessarily deal a decisive blow to these more deeply rooted concerns.  In fact, eliminating the deficit is not even the most important step that the government can take towards addressing these concerns.  Much more important than the magnitude of the deficit - and whether it goes to zero in seven years, ten years or at all - is where and how the government spends the resources it takes from us and the nature of the incentives created by the way those revenues are raised.
<p>
If we wish to ensure the health and well-being of our future and that of our children, then we must increase the amount of savings and productive investments we undertake today so that we achieve continued growth of our standard of living.   Slow growth in domestic investment means slower growth in the amount of capital per worker.  This means slower growth in labor productivity and slower growth in real wages.  Make no mistake about it, growth is the key.  The difference between an economy that grows at 2 percent a year and one that grows at 3 percent a year becomes enormous due to compounding.  After 30 years the economy growing at 2 percent is about 80 percent wealthier while the economy growing at 3 percent is almost 150 percent wealthier.
<p>
I am troubled that too many people, in and out of government, are under the misguided impression that, as soon as we balance the budget, we can start congratulating ourselves for saving the nation from economic calamity and moral degradation.
<p>
You have no doubt heard or read that Americans don't save enough.  Among the major developed countries of the world, the U.S. has one of the lowest rates of gross saving.  For example, gross national saving as a percentage of GDP is 33 percent in Japan, 29 percent in Switzerland, 20 percent in Germany, 19 percent in France and only about 14 percent in the U.S.  This relatively low rate of saving means that any investment in productive capacity that exceeds our domestic savings must be supplied by foreigners.  Low domestic saving is the primary cause of our trade deficit - not the fact that some foreign markets are more closed to U.S. goods than we would like.
<p>
If we think of savings as the resource we choose to set aside for investment, then the investment rate represents that portion of output actually invested.  Here again, the U.S. has one of the lowest investment rates among the major industrial countries.  For example, gross fixed capital formation as a percentage of GPD is 31 percent in Japan, 23 percent in Germany, 21 percent in France, but only about 15 percent in the U.S.
<p>
...
<p>
...if we are not careful about how we shrink the deficit we could easily do so in a way that could actually make our low savings and investment patterns worse.  By increasing the tax on savings and investment and directing more government spending toward consumption or to entitlements for individuals with high rates of consumption, we could reduce the deficit but would actually further reduce the motivation to save and invest for the future.
<p>
As a matter of fact, our budget deficit is simply not that big relative to other countries, even countries that have substantially higher savings and investment rates.
<p>
...
<p>
If the deficit is the wrong focus for the debate, how should we think about addressing the real concerns about our economic future?  There are, of course, many factors that influence our individual decisions to save and invest.  It is important that Congress and the American people debate the impact of government spending decisions and tax policies, not simply in terms of their impact on the budget deficit, but in terms of their impact on investment and saving, and thus our ability to grow and enhance our standard of living.
<p>
Under the current patterns of spending and taxation, our government systematically biases individuals away from saving and investing and towards consumption.  This bias in the way the government spends our tax dollars and the way it raises those dollars is a significant contribution to the lower savings patterns that exist here relative to other industrialized nations.
<p>
...
<p>
Our current system which relies heavily on the income tax, is a system that taxes income that we use for consumer purchases only once, but taxes income that we save two and sometimes three times.  For example, under the income tax, wages, salaries, dividends, interest and capital gains are all taxed as personal income.  If we spend that money on a new car, there is no further income tax liability on the car or on the return or value we get from driving the car.
<p>
On the other hard, if we take those same after-tax dollars and save them or invest them in a business, then the return or the value received for those savings is taxed first at the level of the business and is then taxed again when the business distributes the profits back to the investors in the form of dividends or capital gains.  This system penalizes saving and investing and thus encourages consumption.  Since interest on debt is tax deductible to the business, this system also favors debt over equity as a means of financing business expansion.
<p>
For these reasons, economists have long argued in favor of some sort of consumption tax that would not have the same disincentives to save.  Under a consumption tax all savings would be exempt from tax until they were used to consume goods and services.  This approach is in sharp contrast to the current income tax, which penalizes future consumption by taxing it more heavily.
<p>
...
<p>
In the past, there has never been a strong political constituency for tax reform.  After all, as George Bernard Shaw once said, &quot;A government that robs Peter to pay Paul can always count on the support of Paul.&quot;  In this case, we are denying the benefits of our investments to future generations who, to my knowledge, have not yet found a lobbyist to represent their interests and thus seem to be easy prey for the government looking for someone to tax.
<p>
There is now an increasing awareness that fundamental tax reform is important if we are to come to grips with our low savings and under-investment problems.  We are coming to realize that deficit reduction alone is likely to result in a bitterly disappointing change in our savings patterns.
<p>
...
<p>
...we can rest assured that every group that believes they have a vested interest in specific provisions of the current tax code will argue strongly for preserving the status quo.  Who we won't hear from are those whose wages and living standards will be raised by the increase in capital a less distortionary tax code would promote.  These individuals are not nearly so organized - some of them haven't even been born.
<p>
We must come to grips with the concern that we are not investing enough to ensure real growth in capital and labor productivity that will enhance real wages and living standards in the future.  Additionally, we must also tackle the fundamental issue of tax reform.  If we reduce the deficit without reducing the double and triple taxation on savings and investment, we will have failed.  If the 1996 Presidential campaign does not make tax reform a defining issue, we will miss the greatest opportunity for fundamental tax reform since the 16th Amendment, which created the income tax 82 years ago.
<p>
There is little doubt in my mind that in the short run, the prospects for the economy are good.  The long run opportunities, however, are more troublesome.  We must move beyond the simple-minded and misguided forces on a balanced budget and come to grips with the underlying weakness in our savings and investment patterns that threatens the standard of living of our children.  The current debates in Washington have opened a small crack in the door of the entrenched interests of the bureaucracy that invites a serious discussion of these fundamental concerns.  Combine this with the fact that 1996 is a presidential election year and we have perhaps a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to make fundamental tax reform a major political issue.  The political risks will be high, but so could the economic rewards to the nation.  It should make for a very interesting 1996.

The Institute for Research on the Economics of Taxation (IRET) is a 
non-profit, non-partisan, tax exempt 501(c)(3) public policy research 
organization devoted to informing the public about economic policies, 
especially those concerning the federal tax system, that will contribute 
to economic growth, efficiency and competitiveness.  To this end, IRET 
provides policy makers in the private as well as the public sector with 
objective, closely-reasoned analyses of the economic effects of public 
economic policy initiatives.<br>
<p>
Constructive public policies, in IRET's view, are those that reduce 
government interference in the operation of the private, free market 
system.  Such policies must recognize two basic facts of American 
economic life - one, that individuals' decisions about personal effort, 
saving, investment, and consumption, as reflected in voluntary and free 
exchange in the market place, provide the signals for efficient conduct 
of business, and two, that business is the prime mover on which the 
nation's economic progress depends.<br>

<H1>Time To Terminate Tax Bias Against Saving<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I><B>... a tax deduction for income that is saved ... can be incorporated in a complete overhaul of the income tax [or] adopted as a stand-alone measure that would accomplish a large part of the tax restructuring agenda, but without some of the complications of a full-scale rewriting of the tax code.</CENTER> </B></I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>

<P>
Tax time has rolled around again, and the income tax bias against saving continues to depress economic growth, wages, and personal income.  In January, the National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform called for elimination of the income tax bias against saving.  The commission's report reviewed several generic approaches to providing neutral tax treatment for saving and investment.  One approach is to allow a tax deduction for income that is saved, deferring tax on that income until it is withdrawn at a later date for consumption.  Such an approach can be incorporated in a complete overhaul of the income tax.  Alternatively, it can be adopted as a stand-alone measure that would accomplish a large part of the tax restructuring agenda, but without some of the complications of a full-scale rewriting of the tax code.<br>
<p>
Such a stand-alone measure has already been introduced in the Congress by Senator John Breaux (D-LA) as S. 159, and by Representative Jim McCrery (R-LA) as H.R. 328.  Their bills, based on a proposal by the Savers &amp; Investors League, would permit unlimited tax deductible contributions to individual investment accounts (IIAs) by all taxpayers.<br>
<p>
The Nunn-Domenici tax reform proposal, the Armey flat tax bill, and the American Dream Savings Accounts in the GOP House Contract With America would also reduce the bias against saving to various degrees.  The Nunn-Domenici and Armey reforms are likely to require extended debate before any chance of passage.  The American Dream Savings Accounts would eliminate some of the existing penalties on saving, but only for limited uses.  The Individual Investment Account proposal, on the other hand, is a clean, stand-alone measure that would itself by a major income tax reform.<br>
<P>
Renewed interest in the Congress in reducing the tax bias against
saving is all the more important since enactment of the Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA93). OBRA93 increased
the tax bias against saving by raising individual and corporate
marginal income tax rates, permanently extending phase-outs of
itemized deductions and personal exemptions, tightening rules
limiting contributions to private pension arrangements, and limiting
capital gains treatment of several types of financial transactions.
These provisions are bound to retard private sector saving, capital
formation, and economic growth.
<P>
The Breaux and McCreary bills, similar to the unlimited savings
deduction legislation introduced in the 102nd Congress by Representatives
Dick Schulze (R-PA) and Ed Jenkins (D-GA), continues the campaign for one of
the boldest, most imaginative, and most constructive pro-growth
tax initiatives in many years. The bill would permit taxpayers
to defer taxes on saving without restrictions as to the amount of
saving or time of withdrawal. The bill would all but eliminate
the individual income tax bias against personal saving. It would contribute
to higher levels of saving, investment, productivity, and income
than now exist.
<P>
IIAs would have these features:
<UL>
<LI>Unlimited tax deduction of amounts saved.
<LI>Tax-free investment growth until withdrawal.
<LI>No penalty tax on withdrawal at any age.
<LI>No forced distribution at any age.
<LI>No income tax at death. Heirs may maintain the IIA with the
benefactor's cost basis.
<LI>No estate tax on IIA assets.
<LI>Rollover of up to $15,000 (indexed for inflation) from an
IIA into the first purchase of a principal residence (with an
equal reduction in the tax basis of the house).
<LI>Tax-free rollover into the IIA of the proceeds from the sale
of a principal residence.
<LI>In addition to currently-allowed IRA vehicles, tax deductible
premiums for life insurance if proceeds are payable into an IIA.
</UL>

<P>
IIAs, unlike IRAs, would not be limited to retirement saving.
IRAs have been justified as an incentive for taxpayers to save
for retirement. This is too narrow a focus. IRAs should be thought
of as a very limited means of offsetting the current bias in the
income tax against saving.
<P>
Income is taxed when earned. If the income is used for consumption,
there is no further federal income tax imposed (though there may
be small sales or excise taxes). However, if the income
is saved, the earnings of the saving are taxed repeatedly (and,
if later used for consumption, may also face excise or sales taxes).
The income tax thus raises the cost of saving compared to that
of current consumption.
<P>
A neutral tax code would not penalize saving relative to consumption.
There are two ways to make the taxation of saving and consumption
neutral. Either income that is saved should be exempt from tax
(as in traditional IRAs, 401(k) plans, etc.) and the earnings
of the saving and the principal taxed upon withdrawal, or the
amounts saved should be taxed when earned but the earnings should
be tax exempt (as with tax free securities or the &quot;back-ended&quot;
type of IRA offered in the Bentsen-Roth bill in the 102nd Congress).
<P>
The bias in the income tax extends to all taxable saving, not
just that for retirement. To create a neutral tax
system, all saving, whether for retirement, buying a house, college
tuition, a new car, or protection against a rainy
day, should receive the same treatment as in a tax-deferred income
plan.
<P>
IRAs, as currently constituted, have several short-comings. There
are limits on the amounts that can be deducted. Consequently,
IRAs give no added incentive to save to those who are already
doing long-term saving in amounts above the limits. Amounts withdrawn
from an IRA before age 59-1/2 are subject to a penalty in addition
to tax. This makes IRAs unattractive to lower income savers who
cannot afford to save separately for emergencies, to buy a home,
to pay tuition and other near-term goals, as well as a more distant
retirement. There is a mandatory age (70-1/2) for beginning to
withdraw from IRAs to force commencement of recapture of the tax
deferral.
<p>
All saving contributes
to capital formation, productivity, and national income, regardless
of the motive behind it. There is no economic reason for the government
to discriminate against or discourage any type of saving.  In addition, paying for the projected costs of providing for the retirement of the baby boom and generation Xers will only be possible if private saving is increased substantially and soon.
<P>
The IIA proposal avoids all these pitfalls. IIAs will
generate a greater incentive to save among upper-income savers,
be of far greater safety and appeal to lower-income savers, and
encourage more saving by the elderly and their heirs than current
IRAs.
<P>
Some might object that the near-term cost to the Treasury would
make unlimited IIAs too expensive for the federal budget. This
fear if groundless for several reasons.
<P>
First, when the contribution to an IIA constitutes new saving
that would not have been done in the absence of the incentive,
there would be no loss to the Treasury over the lifetime of the
IIA. The tax on the contribution would be deferred, not lost.  The contribution would grow with interest, and
the tax on the compounded principal would equal in present value
the tax foregone when the contribution was made. There would be
no loss of tax, relative to current law, from letting the interest
accumulate tax-free, because the saving would not otherwise have
been done, and there would have been no interest to tax without
the IIA treatment.
<P>
Second, insofar as a portion of the saving would have been done
in the absence of the IIA treatment, the deferred tax on the compounded
contribution would be recouped with interest. The annual taxation
of the interest would be foregone, but would be more than offset
as that portion of the IIA which constituted new saving added
to the GNP and raised revenues from other taxes on the added income.
<P>
For the most part, then, the present value of the taxes collected
by the Treasury would not be reduced, only altered in its timing
as a result of IIA treatment of saving.
<p>
 Might the delay in collection
of the tax and greater near-term government borrowing decrease national saving and an increase in &quot;crowding
out&quot; of private borrowing?  In practice, the answer is &quot;No.&quot; The amount of added
government borrowing would equal the IIA contribution times the
taxpayer's marginal tax rate - 15%, 28%, 31%, 36%, etc. If the
fraction of new saving in each IIA contribution equaled the tax
rate, e.g., if $28 of a $100 contribution were new saving by a
middle income contributor, then that saving 
would equal the added borrowing by the government, and national
saving would not fall. The leading researchers into the effect
of traditional IRAs on saving behavior have concluded that some
60% to 80% of IRA saving was new saving by contributors, well
above the minimum needed to produce &quot;crowding in&quot; of
added saving, not crowding out. Similar results would be expected
from IIAs.
<P>
Because IIA saving would in large part be new saving, IIAs would
add to the amount of investment and growth of the economy, and
would raise productivity, employment, wages, and profits. The
added income would be subject to tax. When the higher corporate
and personal income taxes and the added payroll taxes are factored
in, IIAs are seen to be clear revenue raisers for the government
over time.<BR>

The merits of reducing the income tax bias against saving have
become more urgent in light of the work of The Bipartisan Commission
on Entitlement and Tax Reform.  The Commission projects that unless
current policies are changed exploding entitlement spending to
pay for the retirement and health care of the baby boom and subsequent
generations will produce budget deficits that will preempt all
projected private saving early in the next century with devastating
economic consequences.  Increasing private saving now is an urgent
necessity to avoid this outcome.
<P>
Legislation based on a proposal by the Savers &amp; Investors
League would permit unlimited tax deductible contributions to
individual investment accounts (IIAs) by all taxpayers.  Identical
bills embodying this proposal, called the Individual Investment
Account Act, have been reintroduced in the Senate and the House
in the 104th Congress by members of both parties:  by Senator
John  Breaux (D-LA) as S. 159, and by Representative Jim McCrery

be tax exempt (as with tax free securities or the &quot;back-ended&quot;
type of IRA offered in the Bentsen-Roth bill in the 102nd Congress).
<P>
The bias in the income tax extends to all taxable saving, not
just that for retirement.  Consequently, to create a neutral tax
system, all saving, whether for retirement, buying a house, college
tuition, a new car, a vacation, or protection against a rainy
day, should receive the same treatment as in a tax-deferred income
plan.
<P>
IRAs, as currently constituted, have several short-comings.  There
are limits on the amounts that can be deducted.  Consequently,
IRAs give no added incentive to save to those who are already
doing long-term saving in amounts above the limits.  Amounts withdrawn
from an IRA before age 59-1/2 are subject to a penalty in addition
to tax.  This makes IRAs unattractive to lower income savers who
cannot afford to save separately for emergencies, to buy a home,
to pay tuition and other near-term goals, as well as a more distant
retirement.  There is a mandatory age (70-1/2) for beginning to
withdraw from IRAs to force commencement of recapture of the tax
deferral.
<P>
All saving contributes to capital formation, productivity, and
national income, regardless of the motive behind it.  There is
no economic reason for the government to discriminate against
or discourage any type of saving.  In addition, paying for the
projected costs of providing for the retirement of the baby boom
and generation Xers will only be possible if private saving is
increased substantially and soon.
<P>
The IIA proposal avoids all these pitfalls.  IIAs will generate
a greater incentive to save among upper-income savers, be of far
greater safety and appeal to lower-income savers, and encourage
more saving by the elderly and their heirs than current IRAs.
<P>
Some might object that the near-term cost to the Treasury would
make unlimited IIAs too expensive for the federal budget.  This
fear is groundless for several reasons.
<P>
First, when the contribution to an IIA constitutes new saving
that would not have been done in the absence of the incentive,
there would be no loss to the Treasury over the lifetime of the
IIA.  The tax on the contribution would be deferred, not lost.
 The contribution would grow with interest, and the tax on the
compounded principal would equal in present value the tax foregone
when the contribution was made.  There would be no loss of tax,
relative to current law, from letting the interest accumulate
tax-free, because the saving would not otherwise have been done,
and there would have been no interest to tax without the IIA treatment.
<P>
Second, insofar as a portion of the saving would have been done
in the absence of the IIA treatment, the deferred tax on the compounded
contribution would be recouped with interest.  The annual taxation
of the interest would be foregone, but would be more than offset
as that portion of the IIA which constituted new saving added
to the GNP and raised revenues from other taxes on the added income.
<P>
For the most part, then, the present value of the taxes collected
by the Treasury would not be reduced, only altered in its timing
as a result of IIA treatment of saving.  
<P>
Might the delay in collection of the tax and greater near-term
government borrowing result in a decrease in national saving and
an increase in &quot;crowding out&quot; of private borrowing?
<P>
In practice, the answer is &quot;No.&quot;  The amount of added
government borrowing would equal the IIA contribution times the
taxpayer's marginal tax rate &#190; 15%, 28%, 31%, 36%, etc. 
If the fraction of new saving in each IIA contribution equaled
the tax rate, e.g., if $28 of a $100 contribution were new saving
by a middle income contributor, then that saving would equal the
added borrowing by the government, and national saving would not
fall.  The leading researchers into the effect of traditional
IRAs on saving behavior have concluded that some 60% to 80% of
IRA saving was new saving by contributors, well above the minimum
needed to produce &quot;crowding in&quot; of added saving, not
crowding out.  Similar results would be expected from IIAs.
<P>
Because IIA saving would in large part be new saving, IIAs would
add to the amount of investment and growth of the economy, and
would raise productivity, employment, wages, and profits.  The
added income would be subject to tax.  When the higher corporate
and personal income taxes and the added payroll taxes are factored
in, IIAs are seen to be clear revenue raisers for the government
over time.

<P>
The merits of reducing the income tax bias against saving seem
to be gaining bipartisan attention in Washington. Legislation
based on a proposal by the Savers &amp; Investors League would
permit unlimited tax deductible contributions to individual investment
accounts (IIAs) by all taxpayers. Identical bills embodying this
proposal, called the Individual Investment Account Act, have been
introduced in the Senate and the House by members of both parties:
by Senator John Breaux (D-LA) as S. 929, and by Representative
Jim McCrery (R-LA) as H.R. 3179.
<P>
Deferral of tax on any income that is saved is also a key feature
of the Nunn-Domenici tax reform proposal presented on Oct. 5.
The Nunn-Domenici proposal contains additional, major changes
in the income tax to reduce excessive taxation of saving and investment,
but offsets the perceived static revenue loss with higher taxes
on labor. The Nunn-Domenici reform is likely to require extended
debate before any chance of passage. The Individual Investment
Account proposal, on the other hand, is a clean, stand-alone measure
that would itself be a major income tax reform.
<P>
Renewed interest in the Congress in reducing the tax bias against
saving is all the more important since enactment of the Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA93). OBRA93 greatly increased
the tax bias against saving by raising individual and corporate
marginal income tax rates, permanently extending phase-outs of
itemized deductions and personal exemptions, tightening rules
limiting contributions to private pension arrangements, and limiting
capital gains treatment of several types of financial transactions.
These provisions are bound to retard private sector saving, capital
formation, and economic growth.
<P>
The Breaux and McCreary bills, similar to the unlimited savings
deduction legislation introduced in the last Congress by Representatives
Dick Schulze and Ed Jenkins, continues the campaign for one of
the boldest, most imaginative, and most constructive pro-growth
tax initiatives in many years. The bill would permit taxpayers
to defer taxes on saving without restrictions as to amount of
saving or time of withdrawal. The bill would all but eliminate
the income tax bias against individual saving. It would contribute
to higher levels of saving, investment, productivity, and income
than now exist.
<P>
The IIAs would have the following features:
<UL>
<LI>Unlimited tax deduction of amounts saved.
<LI>Tax-free investment growth until withdrawal.
<LI>No penalty tax on withdrawal at any age.
<LI>No forced distribution at any age.
<LI>No income tax at death. Heirs may maintain the IIA with the
benefactor's cost basis.
<LI>No estate tax - IIA assets would be excluded from the gross
estate.
<LI>Rollover of up to $15,000 (indexed for inflation) from an
IIA into the first purchase of a principal residence (with an
equal reduction in the tax basis of the house).
<LI>Tax-free rollover into the IIA of the proceeds from the sale
of a principal residence.
<LI>In addition to currently-allowed IRA vehicles, tax deductible
premiums for life insurance if proceeds are payable into an IIA.
</UL>

<P>
IIAs, unlike IRAs, would not be limited to retirement saving.
IRAs have been justified as an incentive for taxpayers to save
for retirement. This is too narrow a focus. IRAs should be thought
of as a very limited means of offsetting the current bias in the
income tax against saving.
<P>
Income is taxed when earned. If the income is used for consumption,
there is no further federal income tax imposed (though there may
be a small sales or excise tax to be paid). However, if the income
is saved, the earnings of the saving are taxed repeatedly (and,
if later used for consumption, may also face excise or sales taxes).
The income tax thus raises the cost of saving compared to that
of current consumption.
<P>
A neutral tax code would not penalize saving relative to consumption.
There are two ways to make the taxation of saving and consumption
neutral. Either income that is saved should be exempt from tax
(as in traditional IRAs, 401(k) plans, etc.) and the earnings
of the saving and the principal taxed upon withdrawal, or the
amounts saved should be taxed when earned but the earnings should
be tax exempt (as with tax free securities or the &quot;back-ended&quot;
type of IRA offered in the Bentsen-Roth bill in the 102nd Congress).
<P>
The bias in the income tax extends to all taxable saving, not
just that for retirement. Consequently, to create a neutral tax
system., all saving, whether for retirement, buying a house, college
tuition, a new car, a vacation, or protection against a rainy
day, should receive the same treatment as in a tax-deferred income
plan.
<P>
IRAs, as currently constituted, have several short-comings. There
are limits on the amounts that can be deducted. Consequently,
IRAs give no added incentive to save to those who are already
doing long-term saving in amounts above the limits. Amounts withdrawn
from an IRA before age 59-1/2 are subject to a penalty in addition
to tax. This makes IRAs unattractive to lower income savers who
cannot afford to save separately for emergencies, buying a home,
paying tuition and other near-term goals, as well as a more distant
retirement. There is a mandatory age (70-1/2) for beginning to
withdraw from IRAs to force commencement of recapture of the tax
deferral, yet the saving done by the elderly is as economically
valuable as saving done by the young. Indeed, all saving contributes
to capital formation, productivity, and national income, regardless
of the motive behind it. There is no economic reason for the government
to discriminate against or discourage any type of saving.
<P>
The Breaux and McCrery bills avoid all these pitfalls. IIAs will
generate a greater incentive to save among upper-income savers,
be of far greater safety and appeal to lower-income savers, and
encourage more saving by the elderly and their heirs than current

<FONT SIZE=5>Tips on Writing a Member of Congress</FONT><BR>
<HR WIDTH=75% ALIGN=center>
</CENTER>
<P>
Senators and Representatives pay attention to their mail.  It is good politics.  Responding to mail is crucial to reelection.  A member knows your vote can be won or lost by his/her response.  The most effective letter is a personal one, not a form letter.  It should be concise, informed, and polite.  Some specific tips:<br>
<P>
1.  Try to stick to one typewritten page.  Two pages at most.  Don't write on the back of a page.  If writing longhand, take care to write legibly.<br>
<p>
2.  In a short first paragraph, state your purpose.  Stick with one subject or issue.  Support your position with the rest of the letter.<br>
<p>
3.  If a bill is the subject, cite it by name and number.<br>
<p>
4.  Be factual and support your position with information about how legislation is likely to affect you and others.  Avoid emotional philosophical arguments.<br>
<p>
5.  If you believe legislation is wrong and should be opposed, say so, indicate the likely adverse effects, and suggest a better approach.<br>
<p>
6.  Ask for the legislator's views but do not demand support.  Remember, Senators and Representatives respond to a variety of views, and even if your position is not supported on one issue or bill, it may be the next time.<br>
<p>
7.  Be sure your name and return address are included and legible.<br>
<p>
8.  The suggested address style is:<br>
<p>
<blockquote>
The Honorable ________________<br>
United States Senate<br>
______________ Senate Office Building<br>
Washington, D.C. 20510<br>
<p>
Dear Senator ________________,<br>

<center>Constituent Clout...The Power of the Pen...</center><br>
</font><hr>
<p>
During a recent symposium on various tax matters to be considered by Congress, an opinion was expressed by a participant that &quot;there's a certain hopelessness about trying to write a letter to Members of Congress and expecting action.&quot;<br>
<p>
Another symposium participant with extensive lobbying experience on the Hill responded as follows as recorded by a court reporter:<br>
<p>
<blockquote>&quot;Let me tell you something:  10 letters, 20 letters to a House Member from his District is a wake up call like you can't believe.  Fifteen telephone calls on one issue in a given two-day period is a wake up call like you can't believe.<br>
<p>
What is very sad about this country is that they---a lot of folks, not everyone---have no clue of the influence they have on their Members of Congress either in the House or the Senate.  Let me tell you, if they sit down and write a letter or they pick up the phone and call that guy, they have a person there who takes count of the calls and what the subject is.  And, that's given to the Member every day, even if he doesn't---does not speak to the Member.<br>
<p>
And all the lobbyists in the world could call in 20 times a day---and I hate to say this in front of my superiors here, but I don't have the influence that 10 people out there calling in from his District who votes in his District will have on that Member.  And that's a definite wake-up call.  All they have to do is pick up the phone.  All they have to do is write a letter.&quot;<br>
<p>
</blockquote>
This commentary is absolutely correct.  You, and your fellow voter/taxpayers within your Congressional District have enormous clout.  Far too often this latent power lies dormant!<br>

Constituent Clout...You Have Political Power!</font></center><br>
<hr>
<p>
Early in 1996, the Sunday New York Times Magazine presented an excellent article that touched on political action.  One paragraph read as follows:<br>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;The N.R.A. doesn't have demonstrations.  They write letters.  In fact, direct action, as a political tactic, is second-choice.  The first choice is to exercise political power, to scare them into voting the right way.  Direct action is what you do when you have no power.  Blacks in the South had to use direct action until they got a voting rights act.  Another problem is, we listen to the critics who say, 'Oh, these politicians don't want to listen to the voters, all they do is listen to campaign contributions.'  In fact, votes will beat money any day.  Any politician forced to choose between his campaign contributors and strong public sentiment is going to vote public sentiment.  Campaign contributions are fungible, you can get new ones.  You can't get new voters.&quot;<br>
<p>
</blockquote>
We, individually and collectively, must exercise our right of protest.  The Savers &amp; Investors League is trying to do its part.  You have political power! Your active participation is vital!<br>

<p>
Welcome.<BR>
<P>
The Savers &amp; Investors League has developed and installed this Web site to help individuals across the country better understand a most serious problem: the irrational taxation of saving and investing.
<P>
Savers and investors do not fare well when it comes to tax legislation.  Not only is the existing income tax severely and improperly biased against saving and investing, savers and investors, as a group, have little political muscle within Congress or Administrations.  This must change.
<P>
There are many excellent organizations and associations that support the needs and desires of savers and investors, such as mutual fund, banking, stock broker, and insurance associations.  However, when priorities are paramount, as is so evident when legislation is formulated, the vital business interests of trade associations, not savers and investors, predominate. 
<P>
Savers and investors are found in all walks of life, in every geographic location, and their interests are fully compatible with the interests of labor; one can't exist and prosper without the other.  It is increasingly being realized that the tax-efficient accumulation of capital is vital to the interests of <EM>all</EM> segments of our society, whether it be labor, capital, or government.  The government produces nothing on its own; its basic sustenance  is from the taxation of capital and labor. When government needlessly and improperly impedes the economic growth of capital, it increasingly impedes the economic growth of labor.  Concurrently, the government  curtails its own tax base.
<P>
The Savers &amp; Investors League is aggressively fighting to remove the government's existing improper and self-defeating tax bias against saving and investing.  The League's activities have political strength directly related to its grass-roots membership within each Congressional District.  Members of Congress do pay attention to the expressed interests of their constituents.  You can easily recognize that each vote counts.  Thus, the League urges and warrants your enthusiastic and active support.  Only by the collective, focused, and sustained action of voter/taxpayers will corrective legislation become law.  The sound taxation of saving and investing will increase jobs and increase our peoples' standard of living.
<P>
 We invite you to explore our Web site.  Read about the actual legislation pending in Congress that could dramatically change the way our Nation taxes your savings and investments.  Review related articles and research reports that support the need for sound, concise tax laws.  Join us as our newest member by filling out and sending in our <A HREF="/savers/member.html">Membership Form</A>. 

We hope the information provided will interest you and prompt you to want to know more and do more about this vital subject.  We stand ready to respond to your enquiries and comments.

<li> Works toward the development and adoption of clear, concise, tax laws that   
 promote increased private saving and investing.<BR>   
<br>   
<li> Works with members of Congress and the Administration to support    
or defeat legislation which affects the taxation of private savings and    
investments.<BR>   
<br>   
<li> Communicates with voter/taxpayers, as well as with financial    
institutions, employers, unions, and the media.<br>    
<br>

<center><b><i>All of your savings and investments should be tax deductible and tax   
deferred<br>  
until you, or your beneficiary, consume it.</i></b></center><br>  
<p>  
The Savers &amp; Investors League was organized in 1988 by <a   
href="/savers/library/tkbio.html">Tom Kelly</a> who recognized the compelling,   
critical need for increased personal savings and investment to foster healthy economic growth in the    
United States. <br>   
<p>   
Without question, private savings and investment is the  foundation for increased personal and national     
prosperity.  Whether these savings are in bank accounts, stocks, bonds, CDs, IRAs, insurance, annuities,    
pension funds, mutual funds, etc., they constitute the vital capital base needed and utilized by individuals,    
families, businesses, and government.<BR>   
<p>   
 On a personal level, insufficient savings creates uncertainty for future retirement, as well as uncertainty   
as to the family financial resources of home and health care needs and desires.  A diminished supply of    
private capital on a national scale causes interest rates to rise and economic growth to slow. Also,    
wages,jobs, and standards-of-living suffer.<br><br>   
 Disastrously, the government continues to pass or maintain self-defeating, senseless laws that   
limit and penalize tax-deferred savings plans such as IRA's, 401(k) s and pensions.<BR>   
<p>   
The annual income tax imposed upon investment return and   
realized gain needlessly and scandalously decreases  the country's   
vital capital base year after year. Not only do taxpayers suffer,   
the government's tax base is progressively reduced too.<BR>   
<P>   
The Nation must maximize personal savings and investment,   
so that private capital will grow and expand as quickly, and as   
soundly, as possible.<BR>   
<P>   
The Individual Investment Account, Senate Bill  
 <a href="/savers/legislation/s159.html">S. 159</a> and House Bill  
 <a href="/savers/legislation/hr328.html">H.R. 328</a>, accomplishes   
this simple but vital objective.<br>  
<p>  
The League helped develop this legislation and works diligently to secure its   
enactment.  The bipartisan sponsors are: Senator John Breaux</a>, Democrat,  
 Senate Finance Committee, and Representative Jim McCrery, Republican,  
 House Ways &amp; Means Committee.<br>  
<p>  
This simple, straight-forward legislation creates IRA-type accounts that provide -   
<br>  
<ul>  
<li>Unlimited, tax-deductible contributions for everyone<br><br>  
<li>No penalty taxes on any account withdrawal<br><br>  
<li>No forced distributions at any time<br><br>  
<li>No income tax nor estate tax at death<br><br>  
<li>Account holder, or beneficiary, only pay taxes on account withdrawals<br><br>  
</ul>  
<p>  
The Individual Investment Account Act has been described by leading tax economists   
as <i>&quot;one of the boldest, most imaginative, and most constructive pro-growth   
tax initiatives in many years.&quot;</i>

<TITLE>Tom Kelly Biography</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#2F4F2F" vlink="#3232CD">
<img src="/savers/images/tkellysm.gif"><FONT SIZE=5><B>&#32;Tom Kelly, President 
and Founder</B></FONT> <HR>
<P>
Tom Kelly, League President and Founder, likes to explain that he is not an actuary, accountant, lawyer or economist.  Instead, he describes himself as an &quot;entrepreneurial businessman&quot; within the pension and life insurance areas who has &quot;a 
facility for conceptualizing and implementing new solutions to old problems&quot;.<BR>
<P>
He began his career in 1948 as a pension and employee benefits consultant with Towers, Perrin, Forster, &amp; Crosby.  In 1962, Tom raised capital to underwrite the First Investment Annuity Company (FIAC).  The Investment Annuity, invented by Tom, was a 


policyowner self-directed variable annuity which had never been offered 
by any insurer previously.<BR> <P>
After fifteen years of product and financial success, the Treasury and 
IRS reversed over 70 favorable rulings issued over prior years to FIAC and other insurer emulators.  FIAC sued the Treasury and the IRS for &quot;arbitrary, capricious, and illegal 
acts&quot;.  The D.C. District Court agreed and stated that indeed the 
Treasury and IRS ruling was in fact arbitrary, capricious, illegal, and 
unreasonable.  Furthermore, the court stated that the IRS had usurped the 
power of Congress, and that deference to their 
expertise on this matter was unwarranted.  The Treasury and the IRS appealed.  The Appellate Court didn't look at 

the merits of the case but ruled that the District Court didn't have 
jurisdiction.  The District Court Judge had previously concluded 
that if FIAC couldn't be 
in District Court, FIAC was being denied due process of law - a 
constitutional matter...<BR> <P>
FIAC employed Robert Bork, Esq., then a Yale law professor and outstanding 
constitutional scholar, to assist in a Supreme Court petition.  For 
unspecified reasons, the 
Supreme Court did not accept the case.  Thus, the Treasury and IRS won - 
but not on the merits

 of their tax law position.  FIAC was thereupon forced to liquidate in 
1978.<BR> <P>
It was this encounter with arbitrary, capricious and illegal government 
acts that prompted Tom's strong interest and on-going great concern about 
the misguided 
driving force behind the government's tax policy in regard to saving.<BR>
<P>
That same year, 1978, Tom formed Insurer Central Services (ICS) that 
assists 
insurers enter the specialized field of variable annuities and variable life insurance.<BR>
<P>
The Savers &amp; Investors League was started in 1988 to educate and 
motivate grass roots voter/taxpayers to challenge and change the way our 
government measures the tax revenue impact of tax deferred savings.  
Towards this end, over the 
intervening years, Tom has worked with legislators, economists, and think tanks to develop legislation that meets the proper criteria for the sound taxation of personal saving.<BR>

<P>    
Because the League lobbies Congress on behalf of voter/taxpayers,
 it is a 501(c)(4) non profit corporation.     
Therefore, contributions to the League are not deductible as charitable contributions for Federal income     
tax purposes. However, contributions to the League may be deductible as an ordinary and necessary     
business expense, or an expense incurred in the production of income.<BR>    
<p> The League's affiliated Savers &amp; Investors Foundation carries out research endeavors that     
explore the impact of taxes on our economy, as well as on taxpayers, our government, and our nation. The     
Foundation is a 501(c)(3) research and educational nonprofit organization. 
Contributions to it are tax     deductible.    
<BR>    
<P>    
Neither the League nor the Foundation have a minimum or    
maximum contribution limit. All contributors choose the contribution    
amount most suitable for themselves.<b> While voluntary contributions    
from all sources are vital to the League's and Foundation's work,    
each voter/taxpayer's active participation via on-going communications    
with his or her Senators and Representative, regardless of contribution    
level, is what really counts. </b> Members of Congress respond to    
strong constituent interest. As a result of the League's activities, 
savers and investors become an increasingly powerful, focused force 
before Congress and the Administration.<BR>

<hr>
<p><br>
The Savers &amp; Investors League is a nonpartisan, nonprofit 
501(c)(4) grass-roots lobbying organization.  Its purpose is to promote 
private saving and 
investment to foster healthy economic growth in the United States.  To
this end, the League develops sound legislative proposals, as well as
circulates information relating to existing and proposed legislation 
which it believes has either a positive or negative effect on saving 
and investing.  It intends to affect such legislation through grass
roots and direct lobbying efforts.<br>
<p>
The League is committed to action-oriented, legislative projects.
Every effort is made to distribute its views and proposals to Congress, 
the Administration, and other policy and opinion leaders nationally and 
locally to ensure that they are widely examined and discussed.  The 
League also disseminates its view via an active media and Internet 
program.<br>
<p>
Every voter/taxpayer (regardless of age or tax bracket) who saves and 
invests has a vital, personal interest in removing the severe income tax 
bias against saving and investing.  As we all know, Congress and the 
Administration pay close attention to public pressure.  Thus, <i>your</i>
 membership is most important because you join with many others to create 
and build the powerful political force so badly needed for success.<br>
<p>
While the Savers &amp; Investors League does not require any kind of annual 
fee to initiate or maintain membership, it does rely on 
voluntary contributions 
from individuals and corporations for its support.<br>
<p>
Because the League lobbies on your behalf, contributions paid to the League 
are not deductible 
as charitable contributions for Federal income tax purposes.  However, 
such contributions may be deductible as an ordinary and necessary 
business expense, or an expense incurred in the production of income to 
the extent permitted by law.<br>

<center><b><i>All of your savings and investments should be tax deductible and tax    
deferred<br>   
until you, or your beneficiary, consume it.</i></b></center><br>   
<p>   
The Savers &amp; Investors League was organized in 1988 by <a    
href="/savers/about.html#tkelly">Tom Kelly</a> who recognized the compelling,    
critical need for increased personal savings and investment to foster healthy economic growth in the     
United States. <br>    
<p>    
Without question, private savings and investment is the  foundation for increased personal and national      
prosperity.  Whether these savings are in bank accounts, stocks, bonds, CDs, IRAs, insurance, annuities,     
pension funds, mutual funds, etc., they constitute the vital capital base needed and utilized by individuals,     
families, businesses, and government.<BR>    
<p>    
 On a personal level, insufficient savings creates uncertainty for future retirement, as well as uncertainty    
as to the family financial resources of home and health care needs and desires.  A diminished supply of     
private capital on a national scale causes interest rates to rise and economic growth to slow. Also,     
wages,jobs, and standards-of-living suffer.<br><br>    
 Disastrously, the government continues to pass or maintain self-defeating, senseless laws that    
limit and penalize tax-deferred savings plans such as IRA's, 401(k) s and pensions.<BR>    
<p>    
The annual income tax imposed upon investment return and    
realized gain needlessly and scandalously decreases  the country's    
vital capital base year after year. Not only do taxpayers suffer,    
the government's tax base is progressively reduced too.<BR>    
<P>    
The Nation must maximize personal savings and investment,    
so that private capital will grow and expand as quickly, and as    
soundly, as possible.<BR>    
<P>    
The Individual Investment Account, Senate Bill   
 <a href="/savers/legislation/s159.html">S. 159</a> and House Bill   
 <a href="/savers/legislation/hr328.html">H.R. 328</a>, accomplishes    
this simple but vital objective.<br>   
<p>   
The League helped develop this legislation and works diligently to secure its    
enactment.  The bipartisan sponsors are: Senator John Breaux</a>, Democrat,   
 Senate Finance Committee, and Representative Jim McCrery, Republican,   
 House Ways &amp; Means Committee.<br>   
<p>   
This simple, straight-forward legislation creates IRA-type accounts that provide -    
<br>   
<ul>   
<li>Unlimited, tax-deductible contributions for everyone<br><br>   
<li>No penalty taxes on any account withdrawal<br><br>   
<li>No forced distributions at any time<br><br>   
<li>No income tax nor estate tax at death<br><br>   
<li>Account holder, or beneficiary, only pay taxes on account withdrawals<br><br>   
</ul>   
<p>   
The Individual Investment Account Act has been described by leading tax economists    
as <i>&quot;one of the boldest, most imaginative, and most constructive pro-growth    
tax initiatives in many years.&quot;</i>   
<p>   
<hr>    
 <FONT size=5><b><a name="obj">Objectives</a></b></FONT><BR>    <hr>   
<P>    
<center><b><i>Your wealth is &quot;wealth&quot; no matter how small or large.<br>    
You must protect it from improper, confiscatory, taxes.</i></b></center><br>    
<p>    
The League's primary objective is to remove the government's senseless     
tax bias against private savings and investments. By building a broad base of voter/taxpayer activists,    
spanning all age groups and income     
levels, the League:<BR>     
<p>    
<ul>    
<li> Works toward the development and adoption of clear, concise, tax laws that    
 promote increased private saving and investing.<BR>    
<br>    
<li> Works with members of Congress and the Administration to support     
or defeat legislation which affects the taxation of private savings and     
investments.<BR>    
<br>    
<li> Communicates with voter/taxpayers, as well as with financial     
institutions, employers, unions, and the media.<br>     
<br>    
<li> Builds coalitions with like-minded groups, unions, and associations.<br>    
<BR>    
<li> Tracks and reports upon relevant legislation as it makes its     
way through the congressional maze.<BR>     
<br>    
<li> Informs the media on current savings and investment taxation issues in     
order to generate broad, public appreciation and understanding     
of this vital subject.<BR>    
</ul>    
<p>  
<hr>    
<FONT size=5><b><a name="sands">Structure and  
Support</a></b></FONT><BR>    <hr>   
   
<P>     
Because the League lobbies Congress on behalf of voter/taxpayers, 
 it is a 501(c)(4) non profit corporation.      
Therefore, contributions to the League are not deductible as charitable contributions for Federal income      
tax purposes. However, contributions to the League may be deductible as an ordinary and necessary      
business expense, or an expense incurred in the production of income.<BR>     
<p> The League's affiliated Savers &amp; Investors Foundation carries out research endeavors that      
explore the impact of taxes on our economy, as well as on taxpayers, our government, and our nation. The      
Foundation is a 501(c)(3) research and educational nonprofit organization.  
Contributions to it are tax     deductible.     
<BR>     
<P>     
Neither the League nor the Foundation have a minimum or     
maximum contribution limit. All contributors choose the contribution     
amount most suitable for themselves. <b>While voluntary contributions     
from all sources are vital to the League's and Foundation's work,     
each voter/taxpayer's active participation via on-going communications     
with his or her Senators and Representative, regardless of contribution     
level, is what really counts.</b>  Members of Congress respond to     
strong constituent interest. As a result of the League's activities,  
savers and investors become an increasingly powerful, focused force  
before Congress and the Administration.<BR>

<img src="/savers/images/tkellysm.gif"><FONT SIZE=5><B><a name="tkelly">&#32; Tom 
Kelly</a>, President and Founder</B></FONT> <HR> 
<P> 
Tom Kelly, League President and Founder, likes to explain that he is not an actuary, accountant, lawyer or 
economist.  Instead, he describes himself as an &quot;entrepreneurial businessman&quot; within the pension 
and life insurance areas who has &quot;a  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
facility for conceptualizing and implementing new solutions to old problems&quot;.<BR> 
<P> 
He began his career in 1948 as a pension and employee benefits consultant with Towers, Perrin, Forster, 
&amp; Crosby.  In 1962, Tom raised capital to underwrite the First Investment Annuity Company (FIAC).  
The Investment Annuity, invented by Tom, was a  
 
 
policyowner self-directed variable annuity which had never been offered  
by any insurer previously.<BR> <P> 
After fifteen years of product and financial success, the Treasury and  
IRS reversed over 70 favorable rulings issued over prior years to FIAC and other insurer emulators.  FIAC 
sued the Treasury and the IRS for &quot;arbitrary, capricious, and illegal  
acts&quot;.  The D.C. District Court agreed and stated that indeed the  
Treasury and IRS ruling was in fact arbitrary, capricious, illegal, and  
unreasonable.  Furthermore, the court stated that the IRS had usurped the  
power of Congress, and that deference to their  
expertise on this matter was unwarranted.  The Treasury and the IRS appealed.  The Appellate Court didn't 
look at  
 
the merits of the case but ruled that the District Court didn't have  
jurisdiction.  The District Court Judge had previously concluded  
that if FIAC couldn't be  
in District Court, FIAC was being denied due process of law - a  
constitutional matter...<BR> <P> 
FIAC employed Robert Bork, Esq., then a Yale law professor and outstanding  
constitutional scholar, to assist in a Supreme Court petition.  For  
unspecified reasons, the  
Supreme Court did not accept the case.  Thus, the Treasury and IRS won -  
but not on the merits 
 
 of their tax law position.  FIAC was thereupon forced to liquidate in  
1978.<BR> <P> 
It was this encounter with arbitrary, capricious and illegal government  
acts that prompted Tom's strong interest and on-going great concern about  
the misguided  
driving force behind the government's tax policy in regard to saving.<BR> 
<P> 
That same year, 1978, Tom formed Insurer Central Services (ICS) that  
assists  
insurers enter the specialized field of variable annuities and variable life insurance.<BR> 
<P> 
The Savers &amp; Investors League was started in 1988 to educate and  
motivate grass roots voter/taxpayers to challenge and change the way our  
government measures the tax revenue impact of tax deferred savings.   
Towards this end, over the  
intervening years, Tom has worked with legislators, economists, and think tanks to develop legislation that 
meets the proper criteria for the sound taxation of personal saving.<BR>

<title>Economic Effects From Universal, Unlimited IRAs</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<h1><center>The Economic Effects Of Legislation Enacting
Universal, Unlimited, Tax-Deductible IRAs</center></h1>
<p>
<pre>

			Increase in GDP			Additional Jobs
	Year		(In $ Billions)		 	 (In Thousands)
        ----            ---------------			---------------

	1996			  153				  489
	2000			  418				1,182
	2010			1,090				1,936
	2020			2,158				2,377
	2030			4,246				2,897
	2040			8,352				3,532
	2060		       32,318				5,078
</pre>
The GDP (Gross Domestic Product) figures represent the change in nominal 
GDP relative to the baseline for that year.  For example, GDP will be 
$2.2 trillion higher in the year 2020 than it would otherwise be in the 
adsence of universal IRAs.  And, by the year 2020, there will be 2.4 
million more jobs in that year than in the absence of universal IRAs.  By 
the year 2060, the increase in GDP from universal, unlimited, 
tax-deductible IRAs will be $32 trillion in excess of GDP otherwise 
available, and 5 million more jobs will be created than otherwise 
available.<br>
<p>
The estimated economic effects illustrated in the above table assume that 
the assets held within universal IRA-type accounts without any penalty 
tax on distribution would have a maximum holding period of just five 
years, and that each contribution would be uniformly withdrawn over five 
years.  In other words, on average, each dollar contributed to the IRA 
would be withdrawn at a rate of 20% per year. (<i>The maximum assumed 
holding period of five years indicates a weighted average holding 
period of 2 1/2 years.  It is the League's view that over a period 
of time such a weighted average holding period will be low and thus 
the assumption is quite conservative.</i>)<br> 
<p>
Since the duration of the average holding period is a determinant of 
gains to be derived from universal IRAs, a sensitivity test indicates 
that if the five-year assumed holding period was increased or decreased 
by just one year, the aggregate IRA assets would be increased by 15%-20% 
within ten years.  It is estimated that adding just one year to the 
assumed holding period would ultimately reduce the effective personal 
income tax rate on savings by 60%.<br>
<p>
<h3><i>Clearly, it is in the interests of everyone, including the 
government, to encourage maximum tax-deductible IRA saving to be held for 
the longest duration possible.</i></h3><br>

<b>NOTE:</b>  The above table was taken from a study commissioned by the 
Savers &amp; 
Investors League by the respected consulting firm of Fiscal Associates, 
Inc..  In that study, they addressed the future dynamic gains to be 
derived from the enactment of universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRA-type 
legislation.  The study was completed in 1993 and all subsequent yearly 
figures were calculated assuming the enacted legislation would have 
occurred in 1993.<br>

</pre>
<p>
The above estimates of the governments's static revenue estimates for 
universal IRAs show a substantial loss in federal revenue.  However, the
estimates also indicate that the dynamic economic results flowing from 
universal IRAs will create sufficient added tax revenues to more than 
offset the static losses.  For example, in the year 2000, the extra tax 
revenue from the expanded, dynamic economic growth will more than offset 
the $67 billion in forgone ordinary income taxes.  With the gap growing 
each year, by the year 2060, the net dynamic federal tax revenue gain in 
excess of static revenue loss from the ordinary income tax will be in 
excess of $2.3 trillion.<br>
<p>
Forecasting the GDP growth for the next sixty five years, it is estimated 
that the net present-value of our nation's GDP to be derived from 
universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs is almost $6.3 trillion dollars 
greater than it would be in the absence of this legislation.<br>

In the year 2000, it is estimated that the after-tax income of taxpayers, 
under its current definition, will be increased by $151 billion due to 
the added growth generated by universal IRAs.  Furthermore, most of that 
gain in after-tax income - 85% - will go to taxpayers with incomes under 
$100,000, and over 60% will go to people with $50,000 or less of adjusted 
gross income.  Additionally, the bulk of the percentage change in 
after-tax incomes will flow to those taxpayers with adjusted gross 
incomes between $10,000 and $100,000.  The percentage increase in the 
after-tax income for taxpayers within these classes ranges between 12% 
and 23%.<br>
<p>
The above table clearly portrays a dramatic improvement in everyone's 
standard of living, <i>and particularly those in middle-income 
America</i>.  These results, which will grow as the IRA assets grow, are 
directly derived from the enactment of universal IRA legislation.<br>

<p>

<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> The above table was taken from a study commissioned by the 
Savers &amp; 
Investors League by the respected consulting firm of Fiscal Associates, 
Inc..  In that study, they addressed the future dynamic gains to be 
derived from the enactment of universal, unlimited, tax-deductible 
IRA-type legislation.  The study was completed in 1993 and all subsequent 
yearly figures were calculated assuming the enacted legislation would 
have occurred in 1993.<br>

SAVERS &amp; INVESTORS LEAGUE<br>
</b></font>
<font size=3><b>Before the Ways &amp; Means Committee<br>
U.S. House of Representatives<br>
on<br>
SAVINGS AND INVESTMENTS<br>
January 31, 1995</b></font><br>
</center>
<hr>
Mr. Chairman, and members of the Committee, I thank you for your
invitation to testify on the Contract With America provisions
that are designed to encourage greater saving and investing. 
We support these goals.  However, it is our strong view that the
Contract does not go far enough to properly correct the existing,
extremely serious tax bias against saving.
<P>
Others on this panel, as well as many other panels in many other
Congresses, have made proper, impassioned pleas for Congress to
restore and expand tax-deductible IRAs, as well as to reduce the
negative impact of the capital gains tax on saving and investing.
Basically, these pleas have been shunted aside by Congress for
two erroneous reasons:  (1) the allegation that they cost too
much in lost tax revenue; and (2) they're perceived by some as
tax loopholes for the rich.
<P>
In the League's judgment, both of these arguments are totally
specious.  These arguments are contrary to the government's own
fiscal interests, as well as being contrary to the taxpayer's,
and our nation's, financial well-being.  Further, removing the
income tax bias <I>against</I> saving does <I>not</I> mean that
such removal is biased <I>for</I> saving.  The resulting taxation
becomes &quot;neutral.&quot;
<P>
It is important to state at the outset that all economists agree
that the ordinary income tax is biased against saving.  The question
is-how much bias?  Is this bias harmful?  To help understand this
bias and its magnitude, Table 1 utilizes two tax brackets to better
illustrate the impact of the ordinary income tax on saving, and
how this cancerous tax eats away at the government's tax revenue.
An actual mutual fund was used for this factual illustration.<p>
<b><center>The Impact of Income Tax Bias On Tax Revenues</b></center>
<p><UL>
<LI>In Table 1, two taxpayers' $100 of income (wage) were taxed
at 15% or 50%, respectively.  The after-tax balance ($85 and $50)
was invested in the mutual fund.  Each end-of-year fund distribution
was taxed to the taxpayer as shown, with the balance reinvested.
This investment was maintained from 1926 to 1992, for a sixty-seven
year duration.  The investment and tax impact during similar durations
in the future will not reflect a significant difference from those
portrayed herein.  Thus, the past is prologue.

(# Includes the 1992 tax on realized gain when the fund
is sold  Note that the long string of government tax collections
from saving would never have occurred if the taxpayers had consumed
(spent) their $85 or $50 net-after-tax income.  It is this second
tier of year after year taxation that produces the income tax
bias against saving.</h6>
<p><UL>
<LI>Obviously, the taxes collected each year bounced around from
year to year.  This reflects the investment climate of the times,
as the U.S. went through good times and bad times, including the
worst depression and World War II.<p>
<LI>Note that as time went on, the expected larger tax revenues
each year from the high bracket taxpayer vs. the low bracket taxpayer
gradually narrowed.  This narrowing spread of tax revenues from
the higher and lower tax bracket taxpayers continued until the
30th year.  <I>From that point forward, the government increasingly
collected more tax revenue from the 15% bracket taxpayer then
from the 50% bracket taxpayer!  </I>
<P>
<LI>These tax revenue losses from the high bracket taxpayer vs.
the low bracket taxpayer continued to grow progressively from
year to year, and culminated in an even larger loss when each
taxpayer sold their fund in the 67th year, and the investment's
unrealized gain was realized and taxed.</ul><p>
<b><center>Valid Conclusions To Be Drawn From Table 1</b></center>
<UL>
<LI>The income tax bias against saving is shocking.  The longer
you save, the worse it becomes, and the government's tax base
related to saving gets smaller.<p>
<LI>There is no escape.  Selling one investment to buy another
usually triggers more tax.  Thus, the government's tax base is
reduced from that point forward, forever.  And, the ever-diminishing
tax base, over what it would be otherwise, is effectively passed
on from one taxpayer to another as savings and investments are
transferred.<p>
<LI>Don't be misled by the fact that when taxes are paid, the
related savings or investment may or may not be liquidated to
pay the tax.  The source of funds to pay the tax may come from
elsewhere.  Regardless, the capital that's otherwise available
for future taxation is reduced by the amount of the tax.<p>
<LI>By increasing tax rates on saving to escape this tax receipts
dilemma, the government wipes out its tax base faster, thereby
eventually collecting less and less tax revenue.<p>
<LI>This tax bias against saving occurs regardless of whether
the return on saving is interest, dividends, or realized capital
gain.<p>
<LI>Is it any wonder that our taxpayers and our government increasingly
feel that they're on a fiscal treadmill that's always accelerating
without forward progress?  They are!  Raising income tax rates
on saving only makes the treadmill move faster, and the problem
gradually gets worse.<p>
<LI>Taxpayers may come and go, but their year-by-year losses of
capital due to the income tax on saving can never be replaced.
Thus, the government's tax base related to saving perpetually
shrinks from what it would otherwise be if this pernicious and
needless tax bias were not present.  Is it any wonder that governments
gradually fail due to fiscal exhaustion?  Ratcheting up taxes
on saving only hastens the demise.  <I>Think about it.</I></UL>
<P>
If the facts in Table 1 don't make your hair stand on end, what
happens to taxpayers' saving under the ordinary income tax will
make your hair curl.  See below.
<p>
<b><center>The Impact of the Income Tax Bias On Saving</b></center>
<P>
Having observed how taxes gradually gnawed away at the government's
tax base over the past sixty-seven years, let's look at how each
taxpayer's investment fared under the ordinary income tax over
the same period of time.<P>

<table border><caption><b>Table 2: Taxpayers' After-Tax Mutual<br>Fund Values On 
12/31/92</b> </caption>
<th>15% Taxpayer <th>50% Taxpayer<tr>
<td>$49,052 <td>$4,598<tr>
</table><p>
In order to evaluate the impact of the income tax that created
these after-tax values, it is proper to measure the value of each
taxpayer's $100 of pre-tax income if it could have been invested
in the mutual fund <I>without any tax</I>.  This value then becomes
a proper benchmark value against which the impact of any tax methodology
may be measured.
<pre>			Table 3:Benchmark Values

	Each Taxpayer's Mutual Fund Values On 12/31/92

	From $100 Investment Without Tax = $120,649
</pre><p>
When one measures the taxpayers' after-tax values in Table 2 vs.
the Benchmark Values of Table 3, each taxpayer's values are the
following percentage of Benchmark Values (Table 2 &#247; Table
3):<p>
<table border><caption><b>Table 4: After-Tax Values As A % Of Benchmark 
Values</b></caption> <th>15% Taxpayer <th>50% Taxpayer<tr>
<th>41% <td>4%<tr>
</table><p>
In short, the 15% taxpayer lost 59% of his benchmark values due
to the ordinary income tax.  That's four times his tax bracket!
The 50% taxpayer lost 96% of his benchmark values!  Such tax
bias against saving amounts to outrageous, idiotic confiscation
worthy of tax revolt!  <I>It must be stopped immediately!  </I>The
tax grievances leading to the Boston Tea Party pale in comparison.
<P>
Clearly, the ordinary income tax is grossly biased against saving.
If these taxpayers hadn't saved, their after-tax spending would
have been 85% and 50% of their before-tax income, respectively,
not 41% and 4% of their unbiased, benchmark values.  Not only
are taxpayers grievously abused by this income tax on saving,
as shown above, the government's own tax base is needlessly and
scandalously whittled away by the ordinary income tax, as shown
in Table 1.<p>
<b><center>Tax-Deductible IRA-Type Plans</b></center>
<P>
Now, let us measure the tax treatment of tax-deductible IRA-type
plans.<p>
<table border><caption><b>Table 5: $100 Of Pre-Tax Income<br>
That Is Deducted As An IRA Contribution<br> 
And Invested In A Mutual Fund On January 1, 1926</b></caption><tr><th><th>
15% Taxpayer <br>$ and % <th>50% Taxpayer<br>$ and %<tr>

</table>
<h6>*  Equals the Benchmark Values in Table 3</h6><p>
From the above you will note that-
<UL>
<LI><I>Each</I> dollar saved and deducted by each taxpayer on
1/1/26 grew, without tax, to $1,206 by 12/31/92.<p>
<LI>Upon the IRA withdrawal, the government not only recaptured
its tax that was deferred on 1/1/26 (i.e., $15 and $50, respectively),
the government also received the full free-market investment growth
on these deferrals, i.e.-
</UL><p>
<pre>
	Table 6: Government Tax Collections On 12/31/92

15% Tax Bracket Taxpayer: $15 x $1,206 = $18,097 See (a) above

50% Tax Bracket Taxpayer: $50 x $1,206 = $60,324 See (a) above
</pre><p><ul>
<LI>Note that the taxpayers effectively contributed $85 and $50
out of their <I>own</I> pocket to their tax-deductible IRAs. 
The remaining part of the $100 contribution (i.e., $15 and $50)
represented the government's deferred tax.  Thus, upon withdrawal
on 12/31/92, the taxpayers received <I>their portion</I> of the
IRA contribution ($85 &amp; $50), plus the full investment growth
thereon, <I>without further tax</I>.  For example-
</UL>
<P>
<pre>
	Table 7: Taxpayers' After-Tax Values On 12/31/92

 15% Tax Bracket Taxpayer: $85 x $1,206 = $102,552 See (b) above

 50% Tax Bracket Taxpayer: $50 x $1,206 =   $60,324 See (b) above
</pre><p>
<UL>
<LI>It is important to recognize that tax-deductible saving is
<I>neutral</I> taxation, and it is fair to all taxpayers, regardless
of their tax bracket.  Each taxpayer defers otherwise taxable
income.  This tax deferral is subsequently taxed upon a withdrawal,
at which time it is taxed at progressive, ordinary income tax
rates.  What is avoided is the senseless, self-defeating second
layer of ordinary income tax that's imposed on the taxpayer's
investment income and realized gain.<p>
<LI>With tax-deductible IRA-type plans, all taxpayers effectively
enjoy a <I>zero</I> tax rate on <I>their own portion</I> of their
contribution to the IRA, e.g., the $85 and $50 illustrated above.
This is the same amount that would have been consumed (spent)
if it had not been saved via the tax-deductible IRA-type plan.
Thus, for this &quot;spending&quot; amount that is saved and
invested, tax-deductible IRAs produce a zero tax on realized capital
gain and a zero tax on dividend and interest income.  This is
proper, neutral taxation, and every taxpayer, regardless of tax
bracket, is treated fairly. 
</ul>
<P>
Surely, too, and properly so, unlimited, tax-deductible IRA-type
plans are more favorable, simpler, and more fiscally sound than
reducing the capital gains tax and indexing the asset basis for
inflation.  While reducing the capital gains tax is also very
appealing and very sound, such a partial removal of the income
tax bias against such saving is not the best course to follow.
<p>
<b><center>Measuring The Cost Of IRAs</b></center>
<P>
Government tax policy is driven by staff revenue estimates.  IRAs
are staff-labeled as &quot;tax-expenditures&quot; and staff-described
as being &quot;most similar to those direct spending programs
which have no spending limits, and which are available as entitlements
to those who meet the statutory criteria established for the programs.&quot;
They liken it to Medicare, Social Security, etc.!  <I>Nothing
could be more inaccurate than those staff descriptions!</I>  
<P>
IRA-type tax deductions are not &quot;spendings,&quot; they're
voluntary savings!  The government's tax analysis faces 180_ in
the wrong direction!  This leads to Committee decisions and government
tax policy that is also faced 180_ in the wrong direction!
<P>
As illustrated with tax-deductible IRA-type plans, the government
gets back every nickel of the tax deduction, plus growth thereon,
at free-market rates of total return!  The alleged revenue loss
the government incurs is the second layer of tax that it should
not impose in the first place, because it is progressively destructive
to the government's tax receipts and imposes confiscatory taxation
on all taxpayers who save!  <I>And &quot;saving&quot; is the life
blood of any progressive civilization. </I>
<P>
Even the government's 1995 Budget document demonstrates that its
&quot;tax expenditure&quot; revenue estimates for tax policy deliberations
are grossly misleading.  For example:
<p><pre>
	Table 8: U.S. Budget Analytical Perspectives-Fiscal Year 1995
			1994 Tax Expenditure Loss From IRAs
			-----------------------------------
	
	1994 Tax Expenditure 		$5.415 Million

	*Discounted Present-Value
	Of The Above Tax Expenditure 	$1.735 Million

	*This figure had never been disclosed before
</pre><p>

The above $5.4 million IRA tax expenditure corresponds to the
Joint Committee on Taxation figures that are used by the Ways
&amp; Means Committee in their tax policy deliberations.  However,
the <I>present-value figure</I> reflects the more realistic fact
that all IRA tax <I>deductions</I> are recovered by the government
with free-market rates of growth thereon!  In effect, therefore,
the government admits that its tax expenditure figures used for
Committee tax policy deliberations are over three times too high
when measured on a more realistic basis ($5.4 &#247; $1.7 = $3.3)!
 Further, the $1.7 million present-value figure represents the
senseless and self-defeating second layer of tax that should never
be imposed in the first place.
<P>
A few years ago, a highly respected Washington, DC, actuary analyzed
the government's methodology in determining tax expenditures relating
to tax deferred saving.  His conclusion was &quot;...these tax
expenditure facts are conceptually flawed, arbitrary, and almost
useless for budget purposes...Any tax law based on such arbitrary
and capricious figures can only be good by accident.&quot;  Amen.
<P>
In short, universal, unlimited, tax-deductible saving (as found
in the bipartisan H.R. 328, the Individual Investment Account
Act) totally removes the income tax bias against saving.  It is
very important to recognize and accept the fact that such tax-deductible
saving represents <I>neutrality</I> in regards to the basic taxpayer
decision of whether to &quot;save&quot; or &quot;consume&quot;
income.  Thus, the removal of the tax bias against saving via
H.R. 328, <I>does</I> <I>not</I> mean that such removal favors
saving over consumption; it <I>does not</I>, it is neutral.
<P>
Clearly, when the question is raised as to the cost of enacting
tax-deductible saving legislation, the paramount question is quite
different-namely, what's the cost of the existing, unrelenting
fiscal drag on the economy that arises from the existing tax bias
against saving?  Common sense and rational tax revenue estimation
clearly show that eliminating the income tax bias on saving can
only be positive, not negative, legislation.<p>
<b><center>The Tax Revenue Impact of Unlimited, Tax-Deductible Saving
<br>As Proposed in H.R. 328</b></center>
<P>
The League strongly supports H.R. 328 (and S. 159, its companion
bill in the Senate) that provides for universal, unlimited, tax-deductible
IRA-type &quot;investment accounts.&quot;  This legislation also
includes the removal of other senseless biases against saving
usually found with existing IRAs, such as penalty taxes, forced
distributions, etc.  See the summary of H.R. 328, attached.
<P>
To illustrate the fiscal impact of H.R. 328, the well-known and
respected economics advisory firm, Fiscal Associates, in 1993
prepared an economic forecast of the revenue aspects of H.R. 328
on two bases:  <I>static</I> (government method) and <I>dynamic</I>
(a far more rational method for measuring the impact of taxes
on saving).<p>

*The above net present-value calculations assume a discount rate
of 11.6 percent-the estimated rate of return to society given
by a long-term return on mutual funds.  The favorable swing (i.e.,
loss to gain:  -b to +a) in estimated revenues is mind-boggling
(e.g., $136 billion in year 2000)!  A copy of the complete Fiscal
Associates report is available to you upon request.

Fiscal Associates' forecasted results also portray a dramatic
increase in taxpayers' after-tax income and related standard of
living that will flow from the prompt enactment of H.R. 328.

<P>
<I>Note how middle-income America will enjoy the bountiful fruits
of unlimited, tax-deferred saving and free-market enterprise that
flows from unlimited, tax-deductible saving via the enactment
of H.R. 328.</I>
<P>
The above positive fiscal results can not be ignored by Congress,
nor the public.  While there may be differences among economists
as to the efficacy of dynamic vs. static scoring and the underlying
assumptions and methods, the &quot;dynamic&quot; results are not
only dramatically favorable, <I>they do reflect common sense and
a far more rational method of estimating the program's fiscal
results.</I>  
<P>
H.R. 328 is bottomed on plain common sense and reflects the economic
facts of life that when you reduce the costs of saving, you get
more of it.  Further, H.R. 328 induced-saving is always measurable
and held in trust for productive, free-market investment that
will grow to everyone's advantage, including the government's,
as it collects its taxes on the enhanced values at ordinary income
tax rates when benefits are paid.  Compounding this tax collection
growth are the added taxes arising from enhanced GDP and the broad
based increase in taxes generated thereby.
<P>
It is important to recognize that unlimited, tax-deductible saving
<I>without</I> penalty taxes, forced distributions, and no income
nor estate tax at death, will greatly increase the propensity
of most taxpayers to save increasing amounts over that which they
would save under the biased-against-saving ordinary income tax.
New saving and increased saving have no offsets to eventual government
tax receipts, because, by definition, these amounts of saving
would have otherwise been spent, thereby forgoing any further
enhanced tax receipts by the government via personal, free-market
investment growth.
<P>
Similarly, to the extent that the &quot;new saving&quot; portion
of a taxpayer's tax-deductible contribution matches or exceeds
his or her tax bracket (e.g., when 15% or more of the tax-deductible
contribution represents <I>new</I> saving for a 15% tax bracket
taxpayer), that new saving portion will match or exceed the government's
borrowing that's needed to replace the temporary loss of revenue
from tax deferral.  Thus, net national saving is maintained or
enhanced.<p>
<b><center>Conclusion</b></center>
<P>
There is no rational reason to defer an aggressive Congressional
push to enact universal, unlimited, tax-deductible saving as proposed
by H.R. 328.  To the extent that existing budgetary rules, or
precedents for tax revenue estimation methods, if any, appear
to impede the consideration and enactment of H.R. 328, it is most
appropriate to very seriously consider their inapplicability and
their inappropriateness to this legislation.  Surely, sound, vital
legislation that increases personal saving within the U.S., as
well as the government's tax revenue receipts derived therefrom,
must not be held hostage to rules and precedents that are inappropriate
and self-defeating to all concerned, including the government.
<P>
The 1994 election reflects a strong voter/taxpayer demand for
a bipartisan government to be bold and sensible in removing the
dead-weight burden of irrational, self-defeating government from
their backs.  The anti-saving bias of the ordinary income tax
is a classic example of faulty government, and it must be removed.
 H.R. 328 is a most attractive, sound way to show that this Committee
and Congress is thoughtful and resolute in seeking proper solutions
to our nation's economic problems.
<P>
We appreciate your request that we testify on this most important
matter.  On behalf of savers and investors, and their vital interests
in the fiscal soundness of our government, we thank you for your
serious interest.  As always, action is what counts.
<P>
<B>SUMMARY OF THE INDIVIDUAL INVESTMENT ACCOUNT ACT, H.R. 328</B>
<UL>
<LI>Unlimited tax deductions for all contributions from any taxpayer.<p>
<LI>Tax-free investment growth until withdrawal.<p>
<LI>All withdrawals are taxed at ordinary income tax rates.<p>
<LI>No penalty tax on any withdrawal.<p>
<LI>No forced distribution at any age.<p>
<LI>With all withdrawals being taxed at ordinary income tax rates,
there is no rational need for income tax nor estate tax at death.
Beneficiary can maintain the account and assumes the benefactor's
tax basis, if any.<p>
<LI>Principal Residence Rollovers:<p>
<ul><LI>Home Purchase:  Up to $15,000-indexed for inflation-of otherwise
taxable distributions may be rolled over from the account without
tax for first purchase of principal residence.  However, the tax
basis of residence is reduced by like amount.<p>
<LI>Home Sale:  Proceeds from sale of a principal residence may
be rolled over into the investment account without tax.  The tax
basis of the account is thereupon adjusted to reflect the tax
basis of former residence, plus the existing law's $125,000 exemption
on the home's sale after age 55.<p>
<LI>This home sale rollover provision is particularly attractive
to &quot;empty nesters&quot; who won't sell their home due to
the income tax on the gain that mainly arises from inflation.
This provision lets them roll over an unproductive asset (home)
for productive investments in the account.  Thus, they may be
able to live better in retirement.  The government will probably
make money on this, because otherwise the &quot;empty nester&quot;
may opt for a &quot;stepped-up basis&quot; for his home upon death.
This rollover provision is a valuable option for many people.
</ul><p>
<LI>Tax-deductible premiums for life insurance are an acceptable
investment within the account, provided the proceeds are payable
into the account for investment therein and eventual taxable distribution.

<font size=4><b><a name="top">Summary</a> Statement of W. Thomas Kelly, President<br>
SAVERS &amp; INVESTORS LEAGUE</b></font><br>
<font size=3><b>Before the Ways &amp; Means Committee<br>
U.S. House of Representatives<br>
on<br>
January 31, 1995</b></font><br>
</center>
<hr>
Mr. Chairman, and members of the Committee, I thank you for inviting
me to comment on those provisions of the Contract With America
that are designed to encourage savings and investment.  The League's
views may be summarized by three important points.
<p>
<b><center>Our First Important Point:</b></center> 
<p>
First, we support the Contract's American Dream Savings
Account provision.  It is certainly a move in the right direction.
However, in our view, these provisions do not go far enough.
Legislation should be adopted promptly to fully remove the ordinary
income tax bias against saving.  
<P>
This cancerous tax bias is a constant, progressive drain on the
fiscal soundness of our government and on the economic growth
of our nation.  This tax bias must be removed- totally.
<P>
This total removal is accomplished by (1) allowing unlimited
tax deductions and tax deferrals for IRA-type saving; (2) income
taxes would be imposed only upon any plan withdrawal at then existing
progressive tax rates, like wages; and (3) there would be no penalty
taxes nor forced distribution at any age.  
<P>
These three, simple, basic criteria are embodied in the bipartisan
Individual Investment Account Act of 1995 (H.R. 328), as sponsored
by Mr. McCrery of this Committee, and S. 159 sponsored by Senator
Breaux of the Finance Committee.
<p>
<b><center>Our Second Important Point:</b></center>
<p>
Our second important point is that no consideration of
how to improve our nation's rate of saving can ignore the staff
procedures for measuring the alleged &quot;tax expenditure costs&quot;
of IRAs.  These staff procedures are so flawed that the Committee's
tax policy considerations are seriously compromised.  
<P>
Even the Treasury Department's 1995 Budget document, for the
first time ever, disclosed that its tax expenditure figures for
IRAs were overstated by over three times when measured on a more
rational, realistic basis.  And, even these severely reduced costs
continue to reflect the self-defeating second layer of tax on
saving that should not be imposed upon our government, our taxpayers,
and our nation.
<P>
Much debate arises over static vs. dynamic scoring of the alleged
costs of IRA-type plans.  Static scoring stands logic and sound
tax policy on its head.  For example, it assumes that IRA tax
deductions are an expense rather than creating a government asset.
The dynamic scoring of IRAs is fiscally sound and entirely proper.
<P>
The dynamic scoring of H.R. 328 by well-respected economists
show that tax receipts grow quickly, and become progressively
larger each year over those otherwise collected under the ordinary
income tax.  
<P>
These increasing tax receipts reflect the growth in saving, in
production, in GDP and in jobs; and the resulting reduction in
the cost of capital brought about by unlimited, tax-deductible
saving.  
 
<P>
And, because the gains arising from increased capital flow
in very large measure to labor, it is estimated that unlimited,
tax-deductible saving will increase the after-tax income
of <I>all</I> middle-income taxpayers by 12% to 23% within six
or seven years following enactment.
<p>
<b><center>Our Third Important Point:</b></center>
<p> 
Our third important point is to recognize that unlimited,
tax-deductible IRA-type plans are <I>not</I> tax loopholes for
the rich.  The full removal of the income tax bias against saving
not only restores the taxation of saving to one of proper neutrality
in terms of saving vs. consumption, it is also neutral in regards
to the taxation of realized capital gain vs. dividends or interest
income.
<P>
Unlimited, tax-deductible, tax-deferred saving is not
a favoring of savers in any tax bracket; it is solely one of restoring
fiscally sound tax neutrality at all tax brackets.
<p>
<center><b>Summary</b></center>

<P>
In summary, the removal of only a portion of the tax bias
against saving, as found in the American Dream Savings Account
legislation, is only a partial correction of the tax bias
against saving when a full correction is both imperative
and sound.
<P>
The unlimited, tax-deductible Individual Investment Accounts of
H.R. 328 are tax revenue gainers, not losers. Thus, there is no reason, other than 
an irrational, existing staff scoring dogma, to deny our nation, including
all taxpayers and our government, the singular advantages
that will flow from this sound legislation.
<P>
The League urges the Committee to thoroughly explore the economic
growth and rational tax revenue implications of H.R. 328.

<font size=4>NEW CONGRESS: IT'S THE ECONOMY, STUPID </font></center>
<p>
Washington, D.C., December 15, 1994 - Our nation is in a &quot;saving&quot;  crisis. 
This crisis is self-inflicted due to the erroneous way our government measures
alleged tax revenue loss from tax-deferred plans like IRAs. 
<p>
In short, the government treats IRA tax deferrals as an expense, when in reality,
the tax deferrals, by their very nature, are government assets.  Certainly, every
IRA owner recognizes that he or she has a tax liability if and when an IRA
withdrawal is ma de.  It's obvious that when the taxpayer has a liability to the
government, the government has an asset of like amount.  That's not and expense! 

Does this governmental error make a difference?  Absolutely-and the cost to
taxpayers, our nation, our economy, and to the government's tax collections, is
mind boggling high! 

The respected economic advisory firm, Fiscal Associates, prepared an analysis that
measured the future fiscal effects of legislation that allows any person to have
unlimited tax deductions for any IRA contributions.  See Table 1. </PRE>

<h6> *The net present-value calculations
assume a discount rate of 11.6 percent-the estimated rate of return to society
given by a long-term return on mutual funds.  This study was prepared in 1993 and
published in Wealth Is Not A Dirty Word, Mill Run Press, P aoli, PA.  The swing
(i.e., loss to gain) in estimated revenues (b-a) is mind boggling (e.g., $136
billion in year 2000)! 
</h6>
The government measures tax revenue on the unrealistic &quot;static&quot; basis
shown above, i.e., the government assumes people don't change their actions when
tax laws are changed, and ignores expanded tax collections from a soundly growing
economy.  [R emember how a static estimate raised taxes on boats, thereby killing
hobs and losing tax revenue?] The &quot;dynamic&quot; basis reflects the realistic
fact that people respond to tax law changes.  In this case, new net saving will
grow dramatically. 
<p>
Increased saving, created by unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs would increase
production, increase jobs, reduce interest costs, and increase tax revenue. 
Taxpayers after-tax income (and related standard of living) by the year 
2000 would be increased as shown in Table 2. </PRE>

Clearly, Congress must immediately put a stop using the thoroughly discredited
static &quot;tax expenditure&quot; method for estimation tax revenues from
tax-deferred plans such as IRAs.  The static method directs governmental tax policy
180 degrees in th e wrong direction.  Without changing any other provision of the
law, correctly measuring the tax impact of unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs would
swiftly increase the after-tax income of middle America by 12% to 20%! 
<p>

On November 8th, the American people voted for rational, substantive change, not
just slogans.  There's no sounder change than H.R. 3179 and S. 929 (103rd
Congress).  These identical bills achieve the desired results portrayed above and
will be reintroduc ed in the 104th Congress. 
<p>

Every caring American should write his or her Representative and Senators now and
urge immediate enactment.  There is no reason for delay.  Every day of delay makes
matters worse.

<P>
Congress, as well as the current (and former) Administration, feel compelled to raise taxes,
coupled with illusionary spending cuts.  Voter/taxpayers are sick and tired, to the point of
revulsion, of the hackneyed demagoguery that always accompanies every budget debate.
  The claim is always made that the sky will fall unless taxes are raised.  Don't elected officials 
ever feel sick from being forced to participate in such a mindless exercise?
<P>
Grass roots voter/taxpayers are awakening to the fact that raising taxes has never, repeat never, cut
 our nation's deficit or debt.  Surely, members of Congress must know this, too.  As all Americans 
with common sense know, only enhanced private saving and private enterprise, coupled with 
governmental spending restraint, can reduce our nation's true deficit and debt.  Federal taxes are not only far too high, they impose a double, even triple tax on saving.
<P>
It is time for every member of Congress, as the elected representative of his or her constituents, to break away from the arcane and incredibly erroneous governmental revenue estimations that have no credibility whatsoever, except among
government people.  They blithely forecast deficit and debt reduction, when realism shows the exact
opposite.  Every member's vote on this important budget and tax matter should reflect plain common sense, not a blind 
acceptance of budgetary legerdemain that cannot be explained nor defended to constituents.
<P>
Regardless of party affiliation, a vote for common sense budget policy will: (a) reject the 
present budget package; and (b) subsequently focus on real, current spending cuts
 and a tax and budget policy that will enhance personal saving and investment, not destroy them.
<P>
It's important to recognize that when people save (regardless of tax bracket), they are placing their savings on the marketplace for others to use. 
 Obviously, the others (in all walks of life and in all tax brackets) who use this saving expect to profit therefrom, while paying for its use.  The 
dynamics of such &quot;free market&quot; capitalism builds upon itself.  
This is what makes nations prosper, 
thereby creating real jobs at all levels.  Clearly, saving should only be taxed once - when it's 
consumed (spent).
<P>
Thus, taxing such saving before it is consumed not only destroys the taxpayers' return, it removes badly needed 
private capital from the marketplace, thereby concurrently destroying the 
government's &quot;private savings&quot; tax base as
 well.  This is a surefire recipe for gradual economic strangulation, not only at the personal and family 
levels, but at the national level as well.
<P>
Our nation is now feeling the ever-tightening economic noose around its neck.

 of certain capital assets, and to allow the capital loss deduction  
 for losses on the sale or exchange of an individual's principal  
 residence.

   Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the  
 United States of America in Congress assembled,  
 SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.  
   This Act may be cited as the `Capital Formation and Jobs Creation  
 Act of 1995'.  
 SEC. 2. 50 PERCENT CAPITAL GAINS DEDUCTION.  
   (a) General Rule: Part I of subchapter P of chapter 1 of the  
 Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to treatment of capital  
 gains) is amended to read as follows:  
                  `PART I--TREATMENT OF CAPITAL GAINS  
                 `SEC. 1201. CAPITAL GAINS DEDUCTION.  
 `SEC. 1201. CAPITAL GAINS DEDUCTION.  
   `(a) General Rule: If for any taxable year a taxpayer has a net  
 capital gain, 50 percent of such gain shall be a deduction from  
 gross income.  
   `(b) Estates and Trusts: In the case of an estate or trust, the  
 deduction shall be computed by excluding the portion (if any) of   
 the gains for the taxable year from sales or exchanges of capital  
 assets which, under sections 652 and 662 (relating to inclusions of  
 amounts in gross income of beneficiaries of trusts), is includible  
 by the income beneficiaries as gain derived from the sale or  
 exchange of capital assets.  
   `(c) Coordination With Treatment of Capital Gain Under Limitation  
 on Investment Interest: For purposes of this section, the net  
 capital gain for any taxable year shall be reduced (but not below  
 zero) by the amount which the taxpayer takes into account as  
 investment income under section 163(d)(4)(B)(iii).  
   `(d) Transitional Rule:   
       `(1) In general: In the case of a taxable year which includes  
     January 1, 1995--  
           `(A) the amount taken into account as the net capital   
         gain under subsection (a) shall not exceed the net capital  
         gain determined by only taking into account gains and   
         losses properly taken into account for the portion of the  
         taxable year on or after January 1, 1995, and  
           `(B) if the net capital gain for such year exceeds the  
         amount taken into account under subsection (a), the rate of  
         tax imposed by section 1 on such excess shall not exceed 28  
         percent.  
       `(2) Special rules for pass-thru entities:   
           `(A) In general: In applying paragraph (1) with respect   
         to any pass-thru entity, the determination of when gains   
         and losses are properly taken into account shall be made at  
         the entity level.  
           `(B) Pass-thru entity defined: For purposes of  
         subparagraph (A), the term `pass-thru entity' means--  
               `(i) a regulated investment company,  
               `(ii) a real estate investment trust,  
               `(iii) an S corporation,  
               `(iv) a partnership,  
               `(v) an estate or trust, and  
               `(vi) a common trust fund.'  
   (b) Deduction Allowable in Computing Adjusted Gross Income:  
 Subsection (a) of section 62 of such Code is amended by inserting  
 after paragraph (15) the following new paragraph:  
       `(16) Long-term capital gains: The deduction allowed by  
     section 1201.'  
   (c) Technical and Conforming Changes:   
       (1) Section 13113 of the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1993  
     (relating to 50-percent exclusion for gain from certain small  
     business stock), and the amendments made by such section, are  
     hereby repealed; and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 shall be  
     applied as if such section (and amendments) had never been  
     enacted.  
       (2) Section 1 of such Code is amended by striking subsection  
     (h).  
       (3) Paragraph (1) of section 170(e) of such Code is amended   
     by striking `the amount of gain' in the material following  
     subparagraph (B)(ii) and inserting `50 percent of the amount of

     amended to read as follows:  
       `(2) Capital gains and losses:

         case of a taxpayer other than a corporation, the amount  
         deductible on account of losses from sales or exchanges of  
         capital assets shall not exceed the amount includible on  
         account of gains from sales or exchanges of capital assets.  
           `(B) Deduction under section 1201: The deduction under  
         section 1201 shall not be allowed.'  
       (B) Subparagraph (B) of section 172(d)(4) of such Code is  
     amended by striking `paragraphs (1) and (3)' and inserting  
     `paragraphs (1), (2)(B), and (3)'.  
       (5) Paragraph (4) of section 642(c) of such Code is amended   
     to read as follows:  
       `(4) Adjustments: To the extent that the amount otherwise  
     allowable as a deduction under this subsection consists of gain  
     from the sale or exchange of capital assets held for more than   
     1 year, proper adjustment shall be made for any deduction  
     allowable to the estate or trust under section 1201 (relating   
     to deduction for excess of capital gains over capital losses).  
     In the case of a trust, the deduction allowed by this   
     subsection shall be subject to section 681 (relating to  
     unrelated business income).'  
       (6) Paragraph (3) of section 643(a) of such Code is amended   
     by adding at the end thereof the following new sentence: `The  
     deduction under section 1201 (relating to deduction of excess   
     of capital gains over capital losses) shall not be taken into  
     account.'  
       (7) Paragraph (4) of section 691(c) of such Code is amended   
     by striking `sections 1(h), 1201, and 1211' and inserting  
     `sections 1201 and 1211'.  
       (8) The second sentence of section 871(a)(2) of such Code is  
     amended by inserting `such gains and losses shall be determined  
     without regard to section 1201 (relating to deduction for  
     capital gains) and' after `except that'.  
       (9) Subsection (d) of section 1044 of such Code is amended by  
     striking the last sentence.  
       (10)(A) Paragraph (2) of section 1211(b) of such Code is

         the net long-term capital gain, and  
           `(B) one-half of the excess of the net long-term capital  
         loss over the net short-term capital gain.'  
       (B) So much of paragraph (2) of section 1212(b) of such Code

        meet the requirements of subparagraph (A) solely by reason  
        of a delay or cancellation of the purchase or construction  
        of the residence, the amount of the distribution may be  
        contributed to an individual retirement plan as provided in  
        subsection (d)(3)(A)(i) (determined by substituting `120  
        days' for `60 days' in such section), except that--  
              `(i) subsection (d)(3)(B) shall not be applied to   
            such contribution, and  
              `(ii) such amount shall not be taken into account in  
            determining whether subsection (d)(3)(A)(i) applies to  
            any other amount.

        amount of qualified higher education expenses for any  
        taxable year shall be reduced by any amount excludable from  
        gross income under section 135.  
      `(6) Recontribution of qualified distributions:   
          `(A) In general: If an individual received a qualified  
        distribution, such individual shall make required

        An individual making a required recontribution under this  
        paragraph shall designate (in the manner prescribed by the  
        Secretary) such contribution as a required recontribution  
        under this paragraph and shall specify the qualified  
        distribution in respect of which such recontribution is  
        being made.  
          `(C) Treated as rollover contribution: For purposes of  
        this title, any required recontribution under this

pension assets of a defined benefit plan (other than a   
multiemployer plan) to an employer--  
      `(1) a trust which is part of such plan shall not be treated  
    as failing to meet the requirements of section 401(a) or any  
    other provision of law solely by reason of such transfer (or   
    any other action authorized under this section), and  
      `(2) such transfer shall not be treated as a prohibited  
    transaction for purposes of section 4975.

qualified transfer made during the taxable year.  
  `(b) Qualified Transfer: For purposes of this section--  
      `(1) In general: The term `qualified transfer' means a  
    transfer--

        subsection (c) are met in connection with the plan.

before the qualified transfer (or in the case of a participant who  
separated during the 1-year period ending on the date of the  
transfer, immediately before such separation).  
  `(d) Definition and Special Rule: For purposes of this section--

    qualified transfer--  
          `(A) any assets transferred in a plan year on or before  
        the valuation date for such year (and any income allocable  
        thereto) shall, for purposes of section 412, be treated as  
        assets in the plan as of the valuation date for such year,  
        and  
          `(B) the plan shall be treated as having a net experience  
        loss under section 412(b)(2)(B)(iv) in an amount equal to  
        the amount of such transfer and for which amortization  
        charges begin for the first plan year after the plan year   
        in which such transfer occurs, except that such section  
        shall be applied to such amount by substituting `10 plan  
        years' for `5 plan years'.'

<font size=5><b>FREEDOM &amp; FAIRNESS RESTORATION ACT<br> 
OF 1995 (Flat Tax) - Summary <br> </font>
<font size=4>H.R. 2060, S. 1050<br></b></font>
<hr>   
(This analysis  is an excerpt from &quotA Side By Side Analysis   
of Alternative Tax System Proposals&quot; 
published  August 1, 1995 by <a href="/savers/legislation/blc.html">The Business 
Leadership Council</a>.)   
   <br>
<hr>
</center>
<b>Sponsors:</b> Mr. Armey and Mr. Shelby<br>   
   <p>
<b>Basic Principles:</b>  The plan is based on the principles set   
forth in &quot;The Flat Tax&quot; by Robert E. Hall and   
Alvin Rabushka (2nd Ed., 1995).  The plan has an individual   
wage tax and a business tax imposed on all   
forms of business which allows the deduction of &quot;business   
inputs&quot; but not taxes, fringe benefits, interest and dividends.   
   <p>
Unlike a value added tax, wages are deductible to the firm   
and the employee is taxed on his wages (after a   
generous standard deduction and dependent exemption).  The   
proposal would have a comprehensive   
consumption tax base.   
   <p>
<b>Rate Structure, Individuals:</b>  20 percent flat tax rate for   
1996, 17 percent thereafter on wages.   
   <p>
<b>Tax Base, Generally:</b>  Individual taxable income is defined   
as wages, retirement distributions and   
unemployment compensation less the standard deduction and   
the dependent exemptions.   
   <p>
<b>Interest, Dividends and Other Investment Income and Expense: 
</b>
Investment income is neither taxable   
to the recipient nor deductible to the payor.   
   <p>
<b>Municipal Bond Interest:</b> Municipal bond interest would not   
be taxable.   
   <p>
<b>Standard Deduction Family Living Allowance: </b> The standard   
deduction would be:   
   <p>
$21,400 for a joint return or surviving spouse;   <br>
$14,000 for a head of household;   <br>
$10,700 for a single person or married couple filing   
separately.   <br>
   <p>
<b>Personal Exemption:</b> None.   
   <p>
<b>Dependent Exemption:</b> $5,000 per dependent.   
   <p>
<b>Capital Gains:</b>  Not taxed on financial instruments.  Gross   
proceeds from real and personal property are   
included in income.  Basis existing prior to enactment of   
the flat tax is not deductible against gross   
revenue from the sale of property.   
   <p>
<b>Home Ownership:</b>  The home mortgage interest deduction is   
repealed.  Capital gains from the sale of a   
home would not be taxed.   
   <p>
<b>State and Local Taxes:</b>  State and local taxes are not   
deductible.   
   <p>
<b>Estate and Gift Taxes:</b>  The unified estate and gift tax is   
repealed.   
   <p>
<b>Pensions, IRAs, and Other Qualified Plans:</b>  Receipts from   
qualified plans by individuals would generally be taxable.   
   <p>
<b>Compensation (Wages & Salaries): </b> Wages would be taxable to   
the employee and deductible to the business.   
   <p>
<b>Charitable Contributions:</b>  Charitable contributions would   
not be deductible.   
   <p>
<b>Educational Expenses:</b>  Educational expenses would not be   
deductible.   
   <p>
<b>Savings, Generally:</b>  The return to savings would not be   
taxed.   
   <p>
<b>Inflation Indexing: </b> The dependent exemption and standard   
deduction are indexed for inflation.   
   <p>
<b>Social Security Benefits:</b>  Social Security benefits are   
exempt.

    described in paragraph (2)-- 
          (A) economic growth as measured by the change in real 
        Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at an annual rate is estimated 
        to be less than 1.5 percent, and 
          (B) the rate of national unemployment (seasonally 
        adjusted) is estimated to be greater than 6.5 percent. 
      (2) TESTING PERIODS- For purposes of paragraph (1), the 
    periods described in this paragraph are-- 
          (A) the period consisting of the quarter during which the

      (1) PRESIDENTIAL DECLARATION- After notification under 
    subsection (a), the President may issue a declaration that 
    temporary income tax reductions are required for a specified 
    calendar year to provide a quick and necessary fiscal stimulus 
    to the economy. Any such declaration shall be transmitted to  
    the Congress. 
      (2) TEMPORARY TAX MODIFICATIONS- If the President transmits a 
    declaration under paragraph (1) to the Congress--

              (i) IN GENERAL- Effective for taxable years beginning 
            in the calendar year specified in such declaration-- 
  (I) the rates applicable to the first income bracket in the tax 
tables contained in section 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 
shall be reduced by a percentage (not to exceed 3 percent)  
specified in such declaration, and 
  (II) the amounts set fourth as tax in such tables shall be 
adjusted to reflect such rate reduction. 
              (ii) WITHHOLDING ADJUSTMENTS- The withholding tables 
            or procedures prescribed by the Secretary of the 
            Treasury or his delegate under section 3402(a) of such 
Code shall be modified so that, to the maximum extent possible, the 
full calendar year effect of such reduction is reflected through 
withholding reductions during the portion of the calendar year  
after such declaration.

        subsequently satisfied- 
              (i) IN GENERAL- Effective for taxable years beginning 
            in the first subsequent calendar year for which the

            satisfied-- 
  (I) each rate of tax in the tax tables contained in section 1 of 
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 shall be increased by the 
percentage determined under paragraph (4) for such year, except the 
tax rate for individuals with Adjusted Gross Income of less than 
$50,000 and taxpayers filing jointly with Adjusted Gross Income of 
less than $75,000 shall not exceed the rates established in the  
year prior to the temporary tax reduction, and 
  (II) the amounts set forth as tax in such tables shall be  
adjusted to reflect such rate increases. 
              (ii) WITHHOLDING ADJUSTMENTS- Effective for such

            or his delegate under section 3402(a) of such Code  
            shall be modified to reflect the increase in tax rates 
            under clause (i). 
      (3) ECONOMIC GROWTH REQUIREMENTS- The economic growth 
    requirements of this paragraph are satisfied for any calendar 
    year if, before the beginning of such calendar year, the 
    President determines (and publishes such determination in the 
    Federal Register) that for such calendar year and the 
    immediately preceding calendar year-- 
          (A) economic growth as measured by the change in the real 
        Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is estimated to be greater

    this paragraph is the percentage increase in the tax rates 
    contained in section 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 
    which the President estimates will result in an aggregate 
    increase in receipts under chapter 1 of such Code equal to the 
    aggregate decrease in receipts under such Code by reason of 
    subparagraph (A) of paragraph (2) without increasing the tax 
    rate for individuals with Adjusted Gross Income of less than

    (2) are satisfied.

SEC. 101. RESTRUCTURING AND REPLACING THE INCOME TAX OF THE UNITED 
                  STATES. 
  (a) Findings: The Congress finds that-- 
      (1) to provide for the prosperity of future generations, the 
    United States must achieve higher levels of saving and 
    investment, which will in turn increase productivity, economic 
    growth, and living standards; 
      (2) the Tax Code is an important element of our national 
    saving policy; 
      (3) the current Tax Code is irreparably flawed and should be 
    replaced with a new progressive system  which promotes saving 
    and investment, and thus more rapid economic growth, while 
    ensuring fairness through progressive taxation; 
      (4) all individuals at all income levels should be given a 
    fair opportunity to save, invest, and raise their standard of 
    living and that of their children; 
      (5) future economic growth requires a tax system that 
    facilitates successful competition in the global marketplace; 
      (6) the tax system of the United States must be as simple and 
    efficient as possible; and 
      (7) to ensure that national saving is increased, reform of  
    the tax system must not increase the Federal budget deficit. 
  (b) Main Features of USA Tax System:  
      (1) Replacement of old tax system: Chapter 1 of subtitle A 
    (related to income taxes) of the Code is repealed and replaced 
    for years beginning after 1995. 
      (2) New tax system: The USA Tax consists of-- 
          (A) a simplified tax collected from individuals, that for 
        years after 1995 replaces the income tax imposed on 
        individuals by section 1 of the Code, and 
          (B) a simplified tax collected from corporations and  
        other businesses, that for years after 1995 replaces the 
        income tax imposed on corporations by section 11 of the Code. 
      (3) USA tax on gross profits: Corporations and other 
    businesses pay tax on their annual gross profits from business 
    conducted in the United States, except that-- 
          (A) export revenues are excluded, and 
          (B) imports are taxed. 
      (4) USA tax on income: Individuals pay tax on their annual 
    income from wages, dividends, interest, and other financial 
    income (including sales of property), except that-- 
          (A) tax is deferred on income the consumption of which is 
        deferred and added to the national stock of savings, 
          (B) a portion of each family's income is exempt from tax, 
        and 
          (C) deductions are allowed for-- 
              (i) education costs, 
              (ii) religious, charitable, and other philanthropic 
            donations, and 
              (iii) home mortgage interest payments. 
      (5) Credit for fica payroll taxes paid: The amount of tax due 
    is reduced by the payroll tax that is-- 
          (A) in the case of an employee, withheld from wages, or 
          (B) in the case of a corporation or other business, paid 
        by the employer. 
  (c) Concepts and Structure of New Tax System:  
      (1) Guiding principles of the usa tax system: The USA Tax is 
    based on the following principles: 
          (A) National wealth and well-being depend on the work, 
        skill, and savings and investment of people. 
          (B) Businesses are people and their capital working 
        together. 
          (C) Capital makes people more productive. 
          (D) Everyone benefits from a growing stock of national 
        savings which in turn allows for a growing stock of  
        physical and human capital. 
          (E) Under the USA Tax, the deferral of taxation on 
        investments in physical and human capital represents an 
        investment by the Federal Government in the Nation's  
        capital stock and the Federal Government shares in the 
        return on its investment in the form of higher economic 
        output and revenues in the future. 
      (2) Single tax in 2 parts: The USA Tax is composed of a 
    business tax and an individual tax which are 2 parts of a  
    single tax system that subjects all income produced and  
    received to taxation once and only once. The 2 parts are as 
    follows: 
          (A) Business tax at the source of income: Tax is paid by 
        corporations and other businesses which produce and sell 
        goods and services that are-- 
              (i) the source of nearly all the gross domestic 
            product of the United States, and 
              (ii) the ultimate source of income received by 
            individuals. 
          (B) Individual tax on income received: Tax is paid by 
        individuals-- 
              (i) when they receive wages and salaries as 
            compensation for gross domestic product created by  
            their work, and 
              (ii) when they receive interest, dividends, and other 
            financial income as compensation for gross domestic 
            product created by their savings and investment. 
      (3) Saving and investment: The USA Tax allows people to save 
    and businesses to invest as follows: 
          (A) Fair opportunity for people to save:  
              (i) No prepayment of tax: When a person defers  
            receipt of income by adding it to the national stock of 
            savings-- 
  (I) a deduction is allowed for the amount saved, and 
  (II) tax is deferred. 
              (ii) Withdrawal of savings and earnings: When 
            withdrawn from savings, both the principal amount saved 
            and the earnings on savings are included in gross  
            income subject to tax. 
              (iii) Analogy to individual retirement accounts: The 
            deduction for saving is the equivalent of allowing a 
            deduction for the contribution a person makes to an 
            individual retirement account (IRA), except that-- 
  (I) savers have greater control and flexibility, 
  (II) no specially designated account is required, 
  (III) savings are not limited to retirement purposes, 
  (IV) the deduction for saving is unlimited in amount, and 
  (V) savings can be withdrawn at any time for any purpose. 
          (B) Fair opportunity for businesses to invest:  
              (i) No prepayment of tax: When a business invests in 
            plant and equipment-- 
  (I) a deduction is allowed for the cost, and 
  (II) tax is deferred. 
              (ii) Tax on earnings and recovery of cost: When 
            recovered out of business revenues, both the cost of  
            the investment and the earnings on the investment are 
            included in gross profit subject to tax. 
              (iii) Expensing: The deduction for investment is the 
            equivalent of allowing the cost of plant and equipment 
            to be expensed instead of depreciated. 
      (4) Fair opportunity to compete in the global marketplace:  
    The USA Tax serves the strategic interests of the United States 
    in international markets as follows: 
          (A) Border adjustable tax:  
              (i) American-made exports: Goods and services  
            produced in the United States can be sold into world 
            markets free of tax. 
              (ii) Foreign-made imports: Goods and services  
            imported into the United States bear a fair and 
            proportionate share of the tax burden in the United 
            States. 
              (iii) Leveling the international playing field:  
            Border adjustments for exports and imports are 
            consistent with international standards and practice. 
      (5) Simpler and more understandable tax: Compared to the 
    income tax it replaces, the USA Tax for individuals-- 
          (A) is written in a simpler, more understandable form, and 
          (B) contains only a few exemptions, deductions, and 
        credits. 
      (6) USA tax is revenue neutral: The USA Tax is designed to 
    neither increase nor decrease the total amount of tax paid and 
    collected under the current Code. 
      (7) Maintaining tax progressivity for individuals:  
          (A) Graduated tax: Like the tax imposed by section 1 of 
        the current Code, the USA Tax for individuals is a  
        graduated tax. 
          (B) Family living allowance: The USA Tax recognizes that 
        every family's budget includes necessities. The USA Tax 
        provides a family living allowance that exempts from 
        taxation the first dollars earned and spent to maintain a 
        basic standard of living. 
          (C) Individual tax burden by income level: The tax burden 
        across income classes ranging from low income to high  
        income is about the same as under the current Code. 
      (8) Business and individual portions of tax burden:  
          (A) Business portion of tax burden: Corporations and  
        other businesses pay about the same portion of the total  
        tax as under the current Code. 
          (B) Individual portion of tax burden: Individuals pay 
        about the same portion of the total tax as under the  
        current Code. 
      (9) Emphasizing personal independence and responsibility:  
          (A) Reinforcing a culture of work and thrift: Instead of 
        being solely a calculation of how much they must pay to the 
        government, the USA Tax converts the income tax into an 
        annual calculation of-- 
              (i) how much people produce and contribute to the 
            economy, 
              (ii) how much they take out of the economy, and 
              (iii) how much they save and put back into the  
            economy for their own and the nation's future. 
          (B) Greater control and responsibility: Because people  
        are allowed to defer tax on income through saving, they 
        have-- 
              (i) more control over their own income and taxes, 
              (ii) a greater ability to plan and provide for their 
            own future, and 
              (iii) a fair opportunity to do so. 
      (10) More opportunity for wage earners at lower income levels:  
          (A) Refundable credit for employee payroll tax: The  
        amount of the payroll tax paid or withheld under the Code 
        from an employee's wages (and paid into the Social Security 
        and Hospital Insurance Trust Funds) is-- 
              (i) credited against the employee's income tax, and 
              (ii) refunded to the employee to the extent in excess 
            of the employee's income tax. 
          (B) Refundable income tax credit for the working poor:  
        The USA Tax-- 
              (i) increases the credit allowed by section 32 of the 
            current Code, and 
              (ii) concentrates the credit on families with children. 
          (C) No effect on trust fund or benefits: The income tax 
        credit allowed for payroll taxes deposited in the Social 
        Security Trust Fund does not-- 
              (i) reduce the amount in such fund, or 
              (ii) reduce the payment of any person's benefits from 
            the fund.

      `(3) Charges for purchases of goods and services: Amounts 
    billed or to be billed to the taxpayer for purchases of goods 
    and services if such amounts are paid within the billing cycle 
    in which such amounts are first billed. 
      `(4) $10,000 of other debt: Not more than $10,000 of 
    indebtedness which is not exempt under another paragraph of  
    this subsection. 
`SEC. 56. SPECIAL RULES. 
  `(a) Special Rules for Bank and Brokerage Accounts:  
      `(1) In general: In the case of a brokerage account or a bank 
    account, for a taxable year-- 
          `(A) `Withdrawal' mean the excess, if any, of-- 
              `(i) Taxpayer withdrawals from the account during the 
            taxable year, over 
              `(ii) Taxpayer deposits to the account during the 
            taxable year. 
          `(B) `Addition to savings' means the excess, if any, of-- 
              `(i) Taxpayer deposits to the account during the 
            taxable year, over 
              `(ii) Taxpayer withdrawals from the account during  
            the taxable year. 
          `(C) Any earnings on assets in the account (including 
        interest, dividends, and the proceeds from the sale of  
        stock or other savings assets) that are credited to the 
        account shall not be taken into account in determining  
        gross income or additions to saving, except to the extent 
        taken into account in subparagraph (A) or (B) because such 
        earnings are withdrawn. 
          `(D) For purposes of this paragraph, if savings assets  
        are transferred to a brokerage account, such assets shall 
        not be treated as `deposits' to the accounts. 
      `(2) Basis:  
          `(A) Initial basis: A taxpayer's initial basis in a bank 
        or brokerage account held on January 1, 1996, shall be the 
        sum of the basis of the assets held in the account except-- 
              `(i) assets whose basis is amortized pursuant to 
            section 12 shall have no basis in such assets for these 
            purposes, and 
              `(ii) a bank account shall have no basis if the 
            taxpayer elects to treat the basis of his bank account 
            as an addition to his general basis account in 
            accordance with section 57(d). 
          `(B) Additions to basis: The basis in a bank account or 
        brokerage account shall increase by the amount of-- 
              `(i) interest on tax-exempt bonds credited to the 
            account, and 
              `(ii) the transferor's basis in any savings assets 
            transferred to a brokerage account. 
          `(C) Reductions in basis: Basis in a bank account or 
        brokerage account will be reduced by the amount by which  
        the withdrawal for the year (as determined under paragraph 
        (1)) exceeds the taxable withdrawal for the year (as 
        determined under paragraph (3)). 
          `(D) Basis in closed account: If a taxpayer closes a bank 
        account or a brokerage account and the taxpayer has basis 
        remaining in the account after application of subparagraph 
        (C) for the year of withdrawal, the remaining basis shall  
        be added to the taxpayer's general basis account. 
      `(3) Taxable withdrawals: The basis in an account shall be 
    allocated to the last withdrawals from a bank account or 
    brokerage account. Accordingly, if a taxpayer has a withdrawal 
    (as defined in paragraph (1)) from a bank account or a  
    brokerage account in a taxable year, the amount of such 
    withdrawal that constitutes a taxable withdrawal equals the 
    excess of-- 
          `(A) the amount of the withdrawal, over 
          `(B) the amount by which the basis of the account exceeds 
        the value of the account as of the end of taxable year. 
      `(4) Definitions: For purposes of this subsection-- 
          `(A) Bank account: `Bank account' means a checking, 
        savings, or money market account with a bank, credit union, 
        or other financial institution. 
          `(B) Brokerage account: `Brokerage account' means an 
        account with a brokerage firm which holds savings assets on 
        behalf of the taxpayer and reports transactions with  
        respect to such assets in periodical reports to the taxpayer. 
          `(C) Value of an account:  
              `(i) Value of bank account: The value of a bank 
            account is the cash held in the account as of the last 
            day of the taxable year. 
              `(ii) Value of a brokerage account: The value of a 
            brokerage account is the sum of the amount of cash in 
            any cash account or account whose value is regularly 
            denominated in dollar value, plus the cost of other 
            savings assets held in the account. 
              `(iii) Cost of savings asset: The cost of a savings 
            asset held in a brokerage account-- 
  `(I) on January 1, 1996, is the taxpayer's basis in such asset if 
he basis is reported to the brokerage firm in accordance with 
regulations prescribed by the Secretary, 
  `(II) transferred to the brokerage account after January 1, 1996, 
is the taxpayer's basis in the savings asset at the time of transfer, 
  `(III) acquired through the brokerage account, is the cost of  
such asset (less commissions), and 
  `(IV) in all other cases, the fair market value of the asset as 
determined by the brokerage firm. 
          `(D) Withdrawals from an account: Withdrawals from an 
        account include service charges, brokerage commissions, and 
        other fees charged to the account. 
      `(5) Provisions not applicable to some accounts: The 
    provisions of this subsection shall not apply to a bank account 
    or a brokerage account-- 
          `(A) if a taxpayer elects in accordance with regulations 
        prescribed by the Secretary not to have the provisions 
        apply, or 
          `(B) the bank, brokerage firm, or other financial 
        institution with which the account is held fails to provide 
        annual reports to the taxpayer in sufficient detail for the 
        taxpayer to make the determinations required by this 
        subsection. 
  `(b) Rollover of Basis in Certain Cases: If a taxpayer sells a 
savings asset in which it has a basis and within 2 weeks of the  
sale acquires 1 or more savings assets, the taxpayer may elect to-- 
      `(1) roll over its basis from the asset sold to the asset 
    purchased, 
      `(2) not treat so much of the proceeds of the sale of the 
    savings asset as equals the cost of new savings assets as a 
    withdrawal, and 
      `(3) not treat so much of the cost of the new savings asset  
    as equals the proceeds of the sale of the old savings asset as 
    new savings. 
Such election shall be made on the tax return for the taxable year 
of the sale of the old asset. 
  `(c) Rules for Gratuitous Transfers:  
      `(1) No withdrawal for donor: If a donor transfers a savings 
    asset other than cash (or a bank account or other similar 
    account with a balance denominated in cash) to a donee, whether 
    during the donor's life or by reason of the donor's death, the 
    donor shall not be treated as withdrawing the amount so 
    transferred. 
      `(2) Anti-abuse rule: Under regulations to be prescribed by 
    the Secretary, paragraph (1) shall not apply to any inter vivos 
    transfer if the transfer is made primarily to effect a transfer 
    of tax liability to a taxpayer in a lower tax bracket. The 
    Secretary may presume that a transfer was made primarily to 
    effect a transfer of tax liability if the savings asset (or any 
    savings asset acquired with the proceeds of such asset) is  
    sold, disposed of, or withdrawn within the 3-year period 
    following the transfer and the proceeds are used to pay  
    expenses that the transferor is likely to have paid but for the 
    transfer. 
      `(3) Transfer of cash or bank account: If a donor transfers 
    cash (or a bank account or other similar account with a balance 
    denominated in cash) to a donee, the donor will be treated as 
    having withdrawn the amount so transferred. The donee will be 
    treated as making an addition to savings to the extent that the 
    donee makes an addition to savings with cash or maintains the 
    account so transferred. 
`SEC. 57. GENERAL BASIS ACCOUNT. 
  `(a) Explanation: The general basis account is intended to allow 
he taxpayer to withdraw from savings an amount of savings equal to 
he amount which had previously been included in income because the 
amount was saved before the Unlimited Savings Allowance became 
applicable or because no savings deduction was allowed because the 
savings was treated as made with borrowed funds, tax-exempt income, 
or from withdrawals of previously taxed savings. 
  `(b) In General: Each taxpayer shall have a general basis  
account, which shall start with a balance of zero, which balance 
shall-- 
      `(1) in the case of a taxpayer with net savings in a taxable 
    year, be increased as of the end of the taxable year by the 
    lesser of-- 
          `(A) the taxpayer's net savings for the taxable year; or 
          `(B) nontaxable sources of funds (as defined in section 
        52(a)(2)(B)), 
      `(2) in the case of a taxpayer with net withdrawals for the 
    taxable year, decreased as of the end of the taxable year, but 
    not below zero, by the amount of net withdrawals, 
      `(3) in the case of the sale of a savings asset by a taxpayer 
    for an amount less than its basis, increased by the amount by 
    which the basis exceeds the proceeds of the sale, and 
      `(4) be increased as provided in subsections (c) and (d). 
  `(c) Special Rules To Ensure Benefit of Savings Deduction Upon 
Sale of Principal Residence: 
      `(1) Explanation: If a taxpayer who is planning to retire or 
    acquire a smaller principal residence sells a principal 
    residence in which the taxpayer has a significant basis and  
    then saves most of the proceeds of the sale, the taxpayer may 
    not have sufficient income in the year to fully absorb the 
    savings deduction attributable to the new savings. This 
    provision allows the taxpayer to use the portion of the savings 
    deduction that would otherwise not be used to reduce future 
    deferred income. 
      `(2) Rule: A taxpayer who sells his principal residence in a 
    taxable year may increase his general basis account by the 
    portion of the saved basis of the principal residence that the 
    taxpayer determines that he cannot use in the taxable year. In 
    his tax return for the year of the sale, the taxpayer shall 
    elect what portion of the saved basis to treat as savings in 
    determining his Unlimited Savings Allowance 
and what portion to add to his general basis account as of the end 
of that year. Once a return is filed in which an election is made, 
he election shall be irrevocable for that taxable year (except if 
he amount of saved basis is reduced by a subsequent purchase of a 
replacement principal residence). 
      `(3) Saved basis: The `saved basis' from the sale of a 
    taxpayer's principal residence shall equal the least of-- 
          `(A) the Unlimited Savings Allowance determined in 
        accordance with section 50 (but without regard to this 
        subsection) for the taxable year of the sale of the 
        taxpayer's principal residence, 
          `(B) the net proceeds from the sale of the residence 
        (including any proceeds applied to pay off indebtedness but 
        excluding proceeds that were applied to pay transactional 
        costs, such as brokerage fees and transfer taxes), or 
          `(C) the excess of the taxpayer's basis in the principal 
        residence over the taxpayer's basis in any new principal 
        residence to which the residence rollover rule of section  
        76 applies. 
  `(d) Election To Increase General Basis Account by Bank Account 
Balance: A taxpayer may elect to increase his general basis account 
by the balance in his bank accounts as of January 1, 1996. Such 
election shall be made on the taxpayer's return for the period 
covering such date. If the election is made, the taxpayer shall  
have no basis in his bank accounts. 
  `(e) Other Adjustments: See section 56(a)(2)(D) (relating to bank 
accounts and brokerage accounts that are terminated with basis) and 
section 78, relating to losses. 
`SEC. 58. ANTI-ABUSE RULES. 
  `(a) Borrowing To Generate Deduction:  
      `(1) General rule: A taxpayer shall not be permitted to treat 
    as a savings asset (and the Secretary shall have authority to 
    deny such treatment if claimed by the taxpayer) if such savings 
    asset was acquired with funds borrowed for the purpose of 
    increasing the taxpayer's Unlimited Savings Allowance or 
    decreasing the taxpayer's deferred income. 
      `(2) Ordering: Subsection (a) shall be applied after the net 
    savings calculation in section 50 and shall apply only to the 
    extent that that section does not itself deny the taxpayer a 
    benefit from the borrowing. 
      `(3) Exempt borrowing: Subsection (a) shall apply to any 
    exempt borrowing to the extent that the borrowing is directly 
    traceable to the acquisition of a savings asset or such 
    borrowing is transitory. 
  `(b) Conversion to Cash: Any cash in excess of $250 held by a 
axpayer on January 1, 1996, shall be treated as a savings asset.  
If such cash is used to acquire a savings asset, it will be treated 
as withdrawn and then used to acquire a savings asset, so that no 
net deduction arises. 
  `(c) Borrowing in Lieu of Withdrawing: If the Secretary  
determines that because of the Unlimited Savings Allowance and 
deferred income rules, taxpayers are borrowing against their  
savings to consume rather than withdrawing their savings, the 
Secretary shall have authority to prescribe rules that treat 
indebtedness that is secured by interests in savings assets as 
amounts withdrawn. 
   `SUBCHAPTER C--BASIS, BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS AND NONRECOGNITION 
                            TRANSACTIONS 
`SEC. 71. EFFECT OF BASIS. 
  `(a) In General: The amount of gross income to be recognized on 
he sale or exchange of property equals the excess of-- 
      `(1) the net proceeds from the sale, over 
      `(2) the taxpayer's adjusted basis, if any, in the property. 
  `(b) Nonrecognition Transaction: Subsection (a) shall not apply  
o nonrecognition transactions described in this chapter. 
  `(c) Savings Assets: Subchapter B generally governs the treatment 
of the basis of savings assets. 
`SEC. 72. BASIS. 
  `(a) Basis, Sale, or Exchange: Except to the extent inconsistent 
with provisions of this chapter, adjusted basis and the existence  
of a sale or exchange shall be determined in accordance with 
principles applicable under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
  `(b) Definition of Basis: For purposes of this chapter, `basis' 
means the adjusted basis of property. The adjusted basis of  
property is generally its cost, as adjusted for actions or 
transactions that increase or decrease the basis of property.  
Except as provided in section 12 (relating to the 3-year 
amortization of basis in savings assets) and section 73 (relating  
o business entities and basis in business entities), the  
axpayer's adjusted basis on January 1, 1996, in an asset acquired 
before that date, shall be its adjusted basis as of December 31, 
1995, as determined under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
  `(c) Effect of Treating Asset Purchase as Savings: If the  
purchase of a savings asset is treated in whole or part as an 
addition to savings, the taxpayer shall have no basis in the amount 
so treated. 
`SEC. 73. BASIS IN BUSINESS ENTITIES. 
  `(a) Partnership Interest:  
      `(1) Initial basis in old partnerships: A partner's basis in  
    a partnership interest as of January 1, 1996, equals-- 
          `(A) the partner's basis in the partnership as of the end 
        of the taxable year ending on December 31, 1995, minus 
          `(B) the amount of the partner's share of the  
        indebtedness of the partnership taken into account in 
        determining such basis. 
      `(2) Negative basis: If the amount determined under paragraph 
    (1) is negative, the taxpayer has a negative basis in the 
    partnership and such negative basis shall increase the gain on 
    the sale or disposition of the partnership interest (except to 
    the extent such negative basis is taken into account in 
    determining the transition basis deduction). 
      `(3) Adjustment to basis:  
          `(A) In general: A partner shall have no basis in a 
        partnership formed on or after January 1, 1996, and shall 
        not adjust his basis in any partnership interest after such 
        date by reason of any-- 
              `(i) contribution to the partnership, 
              `(ii) distribution from the partnership, or 
              `(iii) any change in the partner's share of the 
            partnership's indebtedness. 
          `(B) Exceptions: A partner shall have basis or an  
        addition to basis resulting from-- 
              `(i) contributions of cash or land to a land company 
            (as provided in section 114), or 
              `(ii) a contribution of personal-use property to a 
            partnership (as provided in section 111). 
      `(4) Partnership: For purposes of this subsection, 
    `partnership' includes a corporation that was treated as an S 
    corporation under such Code. 
  `(b) Proprietorship:  
      `(1) Old proprietorship: A proprietor's basis in any business 
    activity conducted before January 1, 1996, which is treated as  
    a business activity as of such date equals-- 
          `(A) the proprietor's adjusted basis in the assets of  
        such business entity as of the end of the taxable year 
        ending on December 31, 1995, minus 
          `(B) the balance of any indebtedness the interest on  
        which the proprietor had treated as business interest under 
        section 163(h)(2)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
      `(2) Negative basis: If the amount determined under paragraph 
    (1) is negative, the proprietor has a negative basis in the 
    proprietorship and such negative basis shall increase the gain 
    on the sale or disposition of the entity (except to the extent 
    such negative basis is taken into account in determining the 
    transition basis deduction). 
      `(3) Adjustment to basis:  
          `(A) In general: A taxpayer shall have no basis in a 
        business entity (as defined in section 151) formed on or 
        after January 1, 1996, and shall not adjust his basis in  
        any such entity by reason of any-- 
              `(i) contribution to the business entity, or 
              `(ii) distribution from the business entity. 
          `(B) Exceptions: A proprietor shall have basis or an 
        addition to basis resulting from-- 
              `(i) contributions of cash or land to a land company 
            (as provided in section 114), 
              `(ii) a contribution of personal-use property to a 
            business entity (as provided in section 111). 
      `(4) Proprietorship: `Proprietorship' includes-- 
          `(A) any family business that is not a partnership, and 
          `(B) any business activity conducted by a taxpayer other 
        than as an employee if such activity constitutes a business 
        entity. 
  `(c) Anti-Avoidance Rule: If partnership distributions to an 
individual partner in its taxable year or taxable years ending in 
1995 exceeds the partner's distributive share of income for such 
period, the amount of such excess distribution shall be treated as  
a cash distribution to the partner on January 1, 1996, and shall  
not reduce the partner's basis in his partnership interest. 
`SEC. 74. GRATUITOUS TRANSFERS. 
  `(a) In General: If after December 31, 1995, a taxpayer receives  
a savings asset or any other property by gift, inheritance, or  
other gratuitous transfer, the taxpayer's basis in the property 
shall be the lesser of-- 
      `(1) the fair market value of the property at the time of 
    transfer, or 
      `(2) the transferee's basis in the property at the time of 
    transfer. 
  `(b) Proof Required: A taxpayer's basis in a savings asset 
received by gift, inheritance, or other gratuitous transfer shall  
be presumed to be zero unless the taxpayer can demonstrate to the 
satisfaction of the Secretary the basis claimed by the taxpayer. 
`SEC. 75. TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING BUSINESS ENTITIES. 
  `(a) Cash Capital Contributions, Business Interests Acquired:  
      `(1) A taxpayer shall have no basis by reason of cash 
    contributed to the capital of a business on or after January 1, 
    1996, except as provided in section 114 (relating to land 
    companies). A contribution of property acquired for purposes of 
    contribution shall be treated as a contribution of cash equal  
    to the amount of property contributed. 
      `(2) A taxpayer shall have no basis in stock or other  
    interest in a business entity purchased on or after January 1, 
    1996, except as provided in section 77 (relating to certain 
    exchanges) or in the case of an acquisition of a land company. 
  `(b) Contributions of Property:  
      `(1) In general: If a taxpayer contributes personal-use 
    property to a business entity the taxpayer's basis in his 
    interest in the entity will increase by the lesser of-- 
          `(A) the fair market value of the property contributed, or 
          `(B) the basis of the property contributed. 
      `(2) Personal-use property: `Personal-use property' shall  
    have the meaning given to it in section 111(c). 
      `(3) No loss: A taxpayer may not increase his general basis 
    account by the amount of any `loss' attributable to basis 
    obtained through the contribution of personal-use property. 
  `(c) Basis in Business Divisions: In the case of a spinoff, 
split-off, or split-up of a business entity in which a taxpayer has 
basis, the taxpayer's basis in the original business entity shall  
be allocated among the new and surviving entities in accordance  
with the relative fair market values of the taxpayer's interests in 
hose entities. If interests in the entities are publicly traded, 
air market values shall be based on public trading prices. In  
other cases, the Secretary shall accept any reasonable allocation 
made by the taxpayer if the taxpayer notifies the Secretary of the 
allocation in an attachment to its tax return for the taxable year 
of the transaction. 
  `(d) Distributions:  
      `(1) In general: In the case of any distribution of property 
    by a business entity to a taxpayer, the taxpayer shall have a 
    withdrawal equal to the amount of-- 
          `(A) cash received, and 
          `(B) the fair market value of property received and not 
        converted to business use. 
      `(2) Savings assets received: The taxpayer may not treat as  
    an addition to savings any savings asset received from a 
    business entity in a distribution or any business property 
    received and contributed to another business entity. 
      `(3) Effect of basis:  
          `(A) Distributions other than in complete liquidation: 
        Except as provided in paragraph (4), in the case of a 
        dividend or other distribution (including any distribution 
        that would be treated as a return of capital under general 
        business law principles or the Internal Revenue Code of 
        1986) by a business entity, a taxpayer's basis in such 
        entity shall not be applied to any amounts or property 
        received in the distribution. 
          `(B) Complete liquidation: In the case of a distribution 
        in complete liquidation of a business entity, a taxpayer's 
        basis in the entity shall be allocated among the cash, 
        savings assets, and property received in the liquidation. 
        Basis allocated to amounts treated as withdrawn shall be

`SEC. 76. ROLLOVER ON RESIDENCE SALE. 
  `(a) Nonrecognition of Gain: If property (in this section called 
`old residence') used by the taxpayer as his principal residence is 
sold by him and, within a period beginning 2 years before the date 
of such sale and ending 2 years after such date, property (in this 
section called `new residence') is purchased and used by the 
axpayer as his principal residence, gain (if any) from such sale 
shall be recognized only to the extent that the taxpayer's adjusted 
sales price (as defined in subsection (b)) of the old residence 
exceeds the taxpayer's cost of purchasing the new residence. 
  `(b) Adjusted Sales Price Defined:  
      `(1) In general: For purposes of this section, the `adjusted 
    sales price' means the amount realized, reduced by the  
    aggregate of the expenses for work performed on the old 
    residence in order to assist in its sale. 
      `(2) Limitations: The reduction provided in paragraph (1) 
    applies only to expenses-- 
          `(A) for work performed during the 90-day period ending  
        on the day on which the contract to sell the old residence 
        is entered into; 
          `(B) which are paid on or before the 30th day after the 
        date of the sale of the old residence; and 
          `(C) which are-- 
              `(i) not allowable as deductions in computing taxable 
            income, and 
              `(ii) not taken into account in computing the amount 
            realized from the sale of the old residence. 
  `(c) Rules for Application of Section: For purposes of this 
section: 
      `(1) An exchange by the taxpayer of his residence for other 
    property shall be treated as a sale of such residence, and the 
    acquisition of a residence on the exchange of property shall be 
    treated as a purchase of such residence. 
      `(2) A residence any part of which was constructed or 
    reconstructed by the taxpayer shall be treated as purchased by 
    the taxpayer. In determining the taxpayer's cost of purchasing  
    a residence, there shall be included only so much of his cost  
    as is attributable to the acquisition, construction, 
    reconstruction, and improvements made which are properly 
    chargeable to capital account, during the period specified in 
    subsection (a). 
      `(3) If a residence is purchased by the taxpayer before the 
    date of his sale of the old residence, the purchased residence 
    shall not be treated as his new residence if sold or otherwise 
    disposed of by him before the date of the sale of the old 
    residence. 
      `(4) If the taxpayer, during the period described in 
    subsection (a), purchases more than 1 residence which is used  
    by him as his principal residence at some time within 2 years 
    after the date of the sale of the old residence, only the last 
    of such residences so used by him after the date of such sale 
    shall constitute the new residence. If a principal residence is 
    sold in a sale to which subsection (d)(2) applies within 2  
    years after the sale of the old residence, for purposes of 
    applying the preceding sentence with respect to the old 
    residence, the principal residence so sold shall be treated as 
    the last residence used during such 2-year period. 
  `(d) Limitation:  
      `(1) In general: Subsection (a) shall not apply with respect 
    to the sale of the taxpayer's residence if within 2 years  
    before the date of such sale the taxpayer sold at a gain other 
    property used by him as his principal residence, and any part  
    of such gain was not recognized by reason of subsection (a). 
      `(2) Subsequent sale connected with commencing work at new 
    place: Paragraph (1) shall not apply with respect to the sale  
    of the taxpayer's residence if such sale was in connection with 
    the commencement of work by the taxpayer as an employee or as a 
    self-employed individual at a new principal place of work. 
  `(e) Basis of New Residence: Where the purchase of a new  
residence results, under subsection (a), in the nonrecognition of 
gain on the sale of an old residence, in determining the adjusted 
basis of the new residence as of any time following the sale of the 
old residence, the adjustments to basis shall include a reduction  
by an amount equal to the amount of the gain not so recognized on 
he sale of the old residence. For this purpose, the amount of the 
gain not so recognized on the sale of the old residence includes 
only so much of such gain as is not recognized by reason of the 
cost, up to such time, of purchasing the new residence.

purposes of this chapter, references to property used by the 
axpayer as his principal residence, and references to the  
residence of a taxpayer, shall include stock held by a 
enant-stockholder in a cooperative housing corporation if-- 
      `(1) in the case of stock sold, the house or apartment which 
    the taxpayer was entitled to occupy 
as such stockholder was used by him as his principal residence, and 
      `(2) in the case of stock purchased, the taxpayer used as his 
    principal residence the house or apartment which he was  
    entitled to occupy as such stockholder. 
  `(g) Husband and Wife: If the taxpayer and his spouse, in 
accordance with regulations which shall be prescribed by the 
Secretary pursuant to this subsection, consent to the application

      `(1) for purposes of this section-- 
          `(A) the taxpayer's adjusted sales price of the old 
        residence is the adjusted sales price (of the taxpayer, or 
        of the taxpayer and his spouse) of the old residence, and 
          `(B) the taxpayer's cost of purchasing the new residence 
        is the cost (to the taxpayer, his spouse, or both) of 
        purchasing the new residence (whether held by the taxpayer, 
        his spouse, or the taxpayer and his spouse); and 
      `(2) so much of the gain on the sale of the old residence as 
    is not recognized solely by reason of this subsection, and so 
    much of the adjustment under subsection (e) to the basis of the 
    new residence as results solely from this subsection shall be 
    allocated between the taxpayer and his spouse as provided in 
    such regulations. 
This subsection shall apply only if the old residence and the new 
residence are each used by the taxpayer and his spouse as their 
principal residence. In case the taxpayer and his spouse do not 
consent to the application of paragraph (2) of this subsection,  
hen the recognition of gain on the sale of the old residence shall 
be determined under this section without regard to the rules 
provided in this subsection. For purposes of this subsection,

individual who dies after the date of the sale of the old residence 
and is married on the date of death, consent to the application of

              are made for more than-- 
                    `(A) 10 qualified foster individuals who have not  
                  attained age 19, and

              his official duties outside the United States. 
          Paragraph (2) shall not apply to any punitive damages in connection

                    `(C) he receives an amount described in subsection (a)(4) 
                  by reason of a combat-related injury, or 
                    `(D) on application therefore, he would be entitled to 
                  receive disability compensation from the Veterans' 
                  Administration.

              reason of a combat-related injury. 
                `(4) Amount excluded to be not less than veterans' disability

USA TAX - Summary<br></font>
<font size=4>S.722<br> 
</b></font>
<hr>
(This analysis is an excerpt from &quot;A Side By Side Analysis Of Alternative Tax System Proposals&quot;  
published August 1, 1995 by <a href="/savers/legislation/blc.html">The Business 
Leadership Council</a>.)  
  </center>
<hr>
<b>Sponsors:</b> Mr. Domenici and Mr. Nunn  
  <p>
<b>Basic Principles:</b>  The bill imposes a steeply graduated consumed 
income tax on individuals.  It imposes   
a subtraction method value added tax on business.  The proposal would have a fairly comprehensive   
consumption tax base but would retain a reduced mortgage interest deduction, a charitable deduction and   
enact a deduction for higher educational expenses.  The proposal would provide a credit to employers and   
employees for FICA taxes paid and an earned income tax credit.  The proposal would have a consumption   
tax base, but the exceptions are significant.  
  <p>
<b>Rate Structure, Individuals: </b> Different tax tables apply for each of 
the years 1996 to 1999, inclusive.  For all years, the top rate is 40 
percent of taxable income.  The 1996 tax tables are: <br> 
  <p>
For married filing jointly and surviving spouses:  <br>
<p>  
$0-$5,399 :     19%  <br>
$5,400 to $24,000 :    $1,026 plus 27%  <br>
Over $24,000 :           $6,048 plus 40%  <br>
  <p>
For heads of household:  
 <p> 
$0-$4,749 :    19%  <br>
$4,750 to $21,100 :   $903 plus 27%  <br>
Over $21,100 :          $5,317 plus 40%  <br>
  <p>
For unmarried individuals:  
  <p>
$0-$3,199 :   19% <br> 
$3,200 to $14,400 :   $608 plus 27%  <br>
Over $14,400 :          $3,632 plus 40%  <br>
  <p>
For married couples filing separately:  
  <p>
$0-$2,699 :   19%  <br>
$2,700 to $12,000 :   $513 plus 27%  <br>
Over $12,000 :          $3,024 plus 40%  <br>
  <p>
<b>Tax Base, Generally:</b>  The individual tax base would include 
compensation,  most fringe benefits,   
dividends, interest, rents, royalties and other capital income, capital gains and certain other income.    
Gifts, municipal bond interest and certain other income would be excluded from the tax base.  Mortgage   
interest on acquisition indebtedness, certain higher education expense and certain charitable contributions   
would be deductible.  Net savings would generally be deductible.  Net dissavings would generally be   
taxable.  
  <p>
<b>Interest, Dividends and Other Investment Income and Expense:</b>  
Interest, royalties, dividends, annuity   
payments, income from life insurance, endowment contracts, distributive share of partnership income (or   
loss) from intangible property and similar investment income would be included in gross income and   
subject to tax.  However, if the income was reinvested (in the sense that the taxpayer increased net   
savings), the taxpayer would receive a deduction and the tax would be deferred.  
  <p>
<b>Municipal Bond Interest:</b>  Municipal bond interest would not be 
taxable.  
  <p>
<b>Standard Deduction Family Living Allowance:</b>  The family living 
allowance (equivalent of a standard   deduction) would be:  
  <p>
$7,400 for a joint return or a surviving spouse;<br>  
$5,400 for a head of household;  <br>
$4,400 for a single person;  <br>
$3,700 for a married couple filing separately.<br>  
  <p>
<b>Personal Exemption:</b>  $2,550 per person.  
  <p>
<b>Dependent Exemption:</b>  $2,550 per dependent.  
  <p>
<b>Capital Gains:</b>  Included in gross income.  However, if the income was 
reinvested (in the sense that the   
taxpayer increased net savings), the taxpayer would receive a deduction and the tax would be deferred.  
  <p>
<b>Home Ownership:</b>  The home mortgage interest deduction is curtailed 
but retained.  Only acquisition   
indebtedness (but not home equity loan) interest would be deductible.  Tax-free rollover of primary   
residence retained.  Capital gains from the sale of a primary residence are taxed.  However, if the proceeds   
were saved, the tax would be deferred.  
  <p>
<b>State and Local Taxes: </b> Generally not deductible.  
  <p>
<b>Estate and Gift Taxes:</b>  The unified estate and gift tax is retained.  
  <p>
<b>Pensions, IRAs and Other Qualified Plans:</b>  All existing rules 
relating to pensions and qualified plans   
are repealed.  Net savings are deductible and the tax deferred until the taxpayer has net dissavings.   
  <p>
<b>Compensation (Wages & Salaries):</b>  Compensation would be taxable to 
individuals.  Compensation   would not be deductible to businesses.  
  <p>
<b>Charitable Contributions:</b>  Charitable deductions would generally be 
allowed up to 50 percent of a   taxpayers adjusted gross income.  
  <p>
<b>Educational Expenses: </b> A deduction of up to $2,000 per year per 
student for certain higher educational   expenses is allowed.  
  <p>
<b>Savings, Generally:</b>  The return to savings would be taxed unless 
saved.  The taxpayer would be afforded   
a deduction equal to his net savings.  Generally, net savings is the excess, if any, of additions to savings   
over taxable withdrawals from savings.  If taxable withdrawals exceed additions to savings, the net   
withdrawal is included in the taxpayers taxable income.  Savings are broadly defined to include most   
financial assets but exclude collectibles.  
  <p>
<b>Inflation Indexing:</b>  The family living allowance, personal exemptions 
and tax brackets are indexed for   inflation.  
  <p>
<b>Social Security Benefits:</b>  Social Security benefits are fully taxable.

 104th CONGRESS  
 1st Session  
 To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to encourage capital  
 formation through reductions in taxes on capital gains, and for  
 other purposes.  
                  IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES  
               June 22 (legislative day, June 19), 1995  
 Mr. Hatch (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. Faircloth)   
     introduced the following bill; which was read twice and   
     referred to the Committee on Finance  
                                A BILL  
 To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to encourage capital  
 formation through reductions in taxes on capital gains, and for  
 other purposes.  
   Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the  
 United States of America in Congress assembled,  
 SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; AMENDMENT OF 1986 CODE.  
   (a) Short Title: This Act may be cited as the `Capital Formation  
 Act of 1995'.  
   (b)  Amendment of 1986 Code: Except as otherwise expressly  
 provided, whenever in this Act an amendment or repeal is expressed  
 in terms of an amendment to, or repeal of, a section or other  
 provision, the reference shall be considered to be made to a   
 section or other provision of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

     SUBTITLE A--CAPITAL GAINS DEDUCTION FOR TAXPAYERS OTHER THAN  
                             CORPORATIONS  
 SEC. 101. CAPITAL GAINS DEDUCTION.  
   (a) In General: Part I of subchapter P of chapter 1 (relating to

 1202 as section 1203 and by inserting after section 1201 the  
 following new section:  
 `SEC. 1202. CAPITAL GAINS DEDUCTION.  
   `(a) General Rule: If for any taxable year a taxpayer other than   
 a corporation has a net capital gain, 50 percent of such gain shall  
 be a deduction from gross income.  
   `(b) Estates and Trusts: In the case of an estate or trust, the  
 deduction shall be computed by excluding the portion (if any) of   
 the gains for the taxable year from sales or exchanges of capital  
 assets which, under sections 652 and 662 (relating to inclusions of  
 amounts in gross income of beneficiaries of trusts), is includible

 exchange of capital assets.  
   `(c) Coordination With Treatment of Capital Gain Under Limitation  
 on Investment Interest: For purposes of this section, the net  
 capital gain for any taxable year shall be reduced (but not below  
 zero) by the amount which the taxpayer takes into account as  
 investment income under section 163(d)(4)(B)(iii).  
   `(d) Transitional Rule:   
       `(1) In general: In the case of a taxable year which includes  
     January 1, 1995--  
           `(A) the amount taken into account as the net capital   
         gain under subsection (a) shall not exceed the net capital  
         gain determined by only taking into account gains and   
         losses properly taken into account for the portion of the  
         taxable year on or after January 1, 1995, and  
           `(B) if the net capital gain for such year exceeds the  
         amount taken into account under subsection (a), the rate of  
         tax imposed by section 1 on such excess shall not exceed 28  
         percent.  
       `(2) Special rules for pass-thru entities:   
           `(A) In general: In applying paragraph (1) with respect   
         to any pass-thru entity, the determination of when gains   
         and losses are properly taken into account shall be made at  
         the entity level.  
           `(B) Pass-thru entity defined: For purposes of  
         subparagraph (A), the term `pass-thru entity' means--  
               `(i) a regulated investment company,  
               `(ii) a real estate investment trust,  
               `(iii) an S corporation,  
               `(iv) a partnership,  
               `(v) an estate or trust, and  
               `(vi) a common trust fund.'.  
   (b) Deduction Allowable in Computing Adjusted Gross Income:  
 Subsection (a) of section 62 is amended by inserting after   
 paragraph (15) the following new paragraph:  
       `(16) Long-term capital gains: The deduction allowed by  
     section 1202.'.  
   (c) Technical and Conforming Changes:   
       (1) Section 1 is amended by striking subsection (h).  
       (2) Paragraph (1) of section 170(e) is amended by striking  
     `the amount of gain' in the material following subparagraph

	ACU: RE-ELECT GINGRICH 
</h3></center>
<a href="/conservative/press/keene010697.html">Statement by David A. Keene</a>
<br><a href="/conservative/press/res010697.html">ACU Board Resolution</a>
<p>

<blockquote>

WASHINGTON, DC.--- "Two major factors have led us to the unprecedented position we announce today on the re-election of Newt Gingrich as Speaker of the House," said David A. Keene, Chairman of the American Conservative Union (ACU). "Regardless of any minor differences we have had with the Speaker in the past, there is no question that under his leadership, the national debate is now being conducted in conservative political terms. From our perspective as the leading grassroots conservative ideological organization, this is vital. To defeat Gingrich is to effectively cede control of the House to the liberals who oppose him. 
<P>
"The second relates to the hypocrisy of Gingrich's liberal Democrat critics. They have transformed the struggle from a routine partisan difference into an ideological battle. They oppose him not just because he is a Republican, but because he has helped reinvigorate the Republican Party and brought conservative initiatives to the forefront of the nation's political agenda. These same liberal leaders have had little or nothing to say about illegal and unethical shenanigans within the Clinton Administration, the Democratic National Committee, and the House Democratic leadership itself."
<P>
ACU's 33-member Board of Directors has endorsed a <a href="/conservative/press/res010697.html">resolution</a> supporting Gingrich's re-election as 
Speaker, observing that "conservative Congressional leadership is required to promote and advance conservative legislative initiatives the American people support in the 105th Congress and beyond" and that Gingrich's critics are attempting to force him from office "for purely partisan political reasons while ignoring extremely serious ethical lapses plaguing the Clinton Administration, the House Democratic leadership, and the Democratic National Committee." It marks the first time that the organization has taken a formal position on a Congressional leadership election.
<P>
"By supporting Newt Gingrich for re-election as Speaker, ACU is not condoning or excusing unethical conduct," Keene said. "If the Speaker has acted contrary to House rules, then he should be held to account just like any other member. What concerns us is that the ethics charges have been exploited by his critics not simply to bring him down personally, but to derail the conservative agenda in Congress. That's why we cannot stand by and watch that happen."  
<P>
ACU, founded in 1964, is the country's oldest grassroots-oriented conservative lobbying organization. On behalf of its nearly one million members and supporters, it lobbies on a wide range of issues before the Congress.<P><center>

<title>Speaker Gingrich Accepting the Speakership of the 105th Congress
</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<center>
<h3>Remarks by Speaker Gingrich</h3>
</center>

<blockquote><blockquote>

<P><br><p>


<P>Let me  say to those who voted for me, from
the bottom of my heart, thank you. To those who voted for someone else,
I hope that I can work with you in such a way that you feel that I am capable
of being speaker of the whole House and representing everyone. </P>

<P>To the freshmen and their families and all the young people who are
here today, you are part of a wonderful experience. Just as in less than
two weeks we will welcome the president for an inaugural, we here in the
legislative branch also celebrate a remarkable moment which the entire
world watches; a time when an entire nation voluntarily decides how to
govern itself and does so in such a manner that there is a sense among
the entire country that freedom is secure and that every citizen can participate.
</P>

<P>This is the 105th time we've done this as a country -- every two years.
The first one actually did not occur until April the 1st, 1789, because
while everyone was supposed to show up in March for the brand new Congress,
they couldn't find a quorum. And then they all came together. And there
are wonderful stories by people who were there written in their diaries
and their letters about the fact that they were just folks from all over,
of many different backgrounds. Back then they would all have been male
and they would all have been white and they would all have been property
holders. </P>

<P>Today we have extended democracy and freedom to levels that the Founding
Fathers could not have imagined. </P>

<P>And any citizen anywhere on the planet watching through C-SPAN and through
the networks and seeing this room and its diversity, can appreciate the
degree to which America opens its doors and its hearts to all people of
all backgrounds to have a better future. </P>

<P>In addition to the elected members, we are very fortunate to have a
professional staff on both sides of the aisle and a professional staff
serving on a nonpartisan basis. And let me say that I think that Robin
Carle stood well as the clerk of the House in representing all of us in
establishing with dignity. </P>

<P>And I thought that in the interchanges between she and Chairman Fazio
that the world could see legitimate partisanship engaged in legitimacy
-- legitimately, exactly the way it should be; in a professional, in a
courteous, in a firm way on both sides. And I think that's part of what
we have to teach the world. </P>

<P>In just a few moments, my dear friend John Dingell, who represents a
tradition in his district, who has fought all these years for all that
he believes in, who in the last Congress served so ably in helping pass
the Telecommunications bill, is going to swear me in. And I am going to
ask -- then I will have a chance to swear you in. But before that, if I
might, I'd say to my dear friend -- let me say my wife is here and my mother
and my relatives. </P>

<P>And two years ago, they were here with my father. He is not here today,
as I think all of you know. He was an infantryman. He served this country.
He believed in honor, duty, country. </P>

<P>Let me say to the entire House that two years ago, when I became the
first Republican speaker in 40 years, to the degree I was too brash, too
self-confident or too pushy, I apologize. To whatever degree, in any way
that I brought controversy or inappropriate attention to the House, I apologize.
</P>

<P>It is my intention to do everything I can to work with every member
of this Congress. And I would just say, as with telecommunication in Congressman
Dingell's case, on welfare reform, on line item veto, on telecommunications
reform, on steps towards a balanced budget, again and again we found a
bipartisan majority willing to pass significant legislation, willing to
work together. </P>

<P>There's much work to be done. I've asked Chairman Henry Hyde of the
Judiciary Committee to look at the issue of judicial activism. He has agreed
to hold hearings looking at that issue. </P>

<P>I think all of us should focus on increasing American jobs through world
sales. And I have asked Chairman Archer to look at the whole issue of taxation
and how it affects American job creation. </P>

<P>I've also asked the Ways and Means Committee to look at oversight on
NAFTA, on the World Trade Organization, because the fact is, we have to
move the legislative branch into the information age. If there are going
to be continuing bodies around the world, then Chairman Gilman in International
Relations and Chairman Archer and others have to get in the habit, I think,
of a kind of aggressive oversight, reporting to the nation on whether or
not our interests are being protected. </P>

<P>I've also asked Chairman Archer to prepare a series of hearings looking
at the entire issue of how we revise the entire tax code; whether we go
towards a flat tax or whether we replace the income tax with a sales tax,
or what we do; but to begin a process that, frankly, may take four to six
years, but is the right direction for the right reason. </P>

<P>Finally, I've asked Chairman Spence, on the National Security Committee,
both to look at the issue of national missile defense and to look at the
question of military reform. </P>

<P>And let me say to all of my friends on both sides of the aisle, we have
every opportunity through reform to shrink the Pentagon to a triangle;
we have every opportunity to apply the lessons of downsizing, the lessons
of the information age. And just because something is in uniform doesn't
mean it has to be saluted, but instead, we should be getting every penny
for our taxpayers, and we in the Congress should be looking at long-term
contracting as one way to dramatically lower the cost of defense. </P>

<P>But I want to talk about one other area. And here I just want to say
there's something more than legislation. Each of us is a leader back home.
And I want to just talk very briefly about three topics, and it's about
these children and their America, children on both sides of the aisle,
children from all backgrounds in every state. </P>

<P>I think we have to ask the question, as leaders, beyond legislation:
How do we continue to create one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty
and justice for all? I believe most Americans, whether native-born or immigrant,
still desire for us to be one nation. So let me briefly talk about three
areas that I think are vital. </P>

<P>Let me say first, I think -- I'm going to talk just for a second about
race, drugs and ignorance. First, let me ask all you: Do we not need to
rethink our whole approach to race? And let me draw the parallel to Dick
Fosbury. He was a high jumper. In the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City, he
developed an entire new approach which is now used by everyone. Yet for
six years, the U.S. Olympic Committee rejected it. </P>

<P>My point is very simple. I don't believe any rational American can be
comfortable with where we are on the issue of race. And I think all of
us ought to take on the challenge as leaders, beyond legislation, beyond
our normal jobs, of asking some new questions in some new ways. After all,
what does race mean when if based on merit alone, ethnic Asians would make
up a clear majority at the University of California at Berkeley? What does
race mean when colleges recruit minorities in the name of inclusiveness
and diversity and then segregate them in their own dormitories? What does
race mean when many Americans cannot fill out their census forms because
they're an amalgam of races? And furthermore, if those of us who are conservative
say that bureaucracy and compulsion is not the answer, then what are we
going to say to a child born in a poor neighborhood with a broken home
and no one to help them rise, who has no organic contact to prosperity
and has no organic contact to a better future? </P>

<P>Now, I mentioned this in passing two years ago, and one of the failures
that I would take some of the responsibility for is that we did not follow
up. But I want to put it right on the table today that every one of us,
as a leader, has an obligation to reach out beyond party and beyond ideology
and, as Americans, to say, ``One of the highest values we're going to spend
the next two years on is openly dealing with the challenge of meaning that
when we say in our declaration that we are endowed by our Creator with
certain unalienable rights, including life, liberty and the pursuit of
happiness, that every child in every neighborhood, of every background,
is endowed by God. </P>

<P>And every time America fails to meet that, we are failing to meet God's
test for the country we should be.'' </P>

<P>Let me say second about drugs; I think we have to redefine and rethink
our approach to drugs. One of my close friends had her 19-year-old sister
overdose, and her 19-year-old sister today is in a coma and celebrated
her 20th birthday in that coma. Drugs aren't statistics. As Charlie Rangel
told me at breakfast just two years ago, drugs are real human beings being
destroyed. Drugs are real violence. If we did not have drugs in this country,
the amount of spouse abuse, the amount of child abuse, the amount of violence
would drop dramatically. And so I want to suggest that we should take seriously
reaching across all barriers and establishing an all-out effort. </P>

<P>You know, the Columbia University Center for Addiction and Substance
Abuse has done a fascinating study. The center found that one of the best
predictors of whether a child will stay free of drugs is whether he or
she practices a religion. Joe Califano, Lyndon Johnson's former adviser
and Jimmy Carter's secretary of Health and Human Services, says that religion
is part of the solution to our drug problems and to drug treatment itself.
Alcoholics Anonymous refers to a ``higher power.'' I don't know what all
the answers are. But I do know that if we love these children, in addition
to fighting racism and reaching out to every child, we need to decide that
we are prepared to have the equivalent of an abolitionist movement against
drugs and to do what it takes so that none of these children end up in
a coma celebrating their birthday or end up dead. </P>

<P>Lastly, we need to pay closer attention to a word you don't hear much
anymore: ignorance. Traditionally, ignorance ranked with pestilence, hunger,
war as abominations upon humanity. But in recent years, the word ignorance
has been cleaned up and refined into some aspect of educational failure.
I mean by ignorance something deeper. It's not about geography in the third
grade. It's about learning the work ethic. It's about learning to be a
citizen. It's about learning to save. It's about all the things that make
us functional. It's about the things that allow virtually everybody in
this room to get up each morning and have a good life. </P>

<P>There are too many place in America where people are born into dysfunction,
educated into dysfunction and live in dysfunction, and we should find a
way to reach out in this modern era and use every tool at our tips, from
computers to television to radio to personal volunteerism, so that every
family that today happens to be dysfunctional has a chance within the next
few years to learn to be functional. </P>

<P>And I think we should take ignorance as as serious a problem as drugs
or race. </P>

<P>We in the Congress have one place; we have an obligation beyond any
other, and that's this city. And I want to commend Eleanor Holmes-Norton
for the leadership she has shown and the courage she has shown day after
day and week after week. She and Tom Davis and Jim Walsh worked their hearts
out over the last two years, and I believe it is fair to say that in some
ways, we have begun to make progress. It is not easy. It has to be done
carefully. It cannot violate the right of the citizens of this city. But
let's be candid, first, this is our national capital. We have a unique
obligation on both sides of the aisle, to care about Washington, because
we are today to Washington what a state government would be back home to
your town. We have an unusual obligation to Washington. </P>

<P>Second, it is our national capital. And people looked at me as though
I'd lost my mind a year and a half ago when I met with Mayor Barry and
I said, ``You know, our vision ought to be the finest capital city in the
world.'' And that ought to be our vision. </P>

<P>And furthermore, if we're going to talk honestly about race and we're
going to talk honestly about drugs and we're going to talk honestly about
ignorance, we owe it to every citizen of this District, every child in
this District, to have a decent chance to grow up and go to a school that
succeeds, in a neighborhood that is drug-free and safe, with an expectation
of getting a job in a community that actually cares about them and provides
a better future. And we should take on as a capital -- as a Congress, our
responsibilities to the District of Columbia, and we should do it proudly.
And we should not be ashamed to go back home and say, ``You're darn right
we're helping our national capital because we want you to visit it with
pride, and we want you to know that you can say to anyone anywhere in the
world: Come to America and visit Washington, it is a great city.'' </P>

<P>Let me close with this final thought -- and I appreciate my friend,
John, standing there. And I apologize for having drawn you forward, particularly
since you're standing on one foot. </P>

<P>But this has been a very difficult time. And to those who agonized and
ended up voting for me, I thank you. Some of this difficulty, frankly,
I brought on myself. We will deal with that in more detail later. And I
apologize to the House and the country for having done so. Some of it is
part of the natural process of partisan competition. </P>

<P>This morning, a very dear friend of mine said that he was going to pray
to God that I would win today, and I asked him not to. I asked him to pray
to God that whatever happens is what God wants, and then we would try to
understand it and learn from it. </P>

<P>Let me put that forward in the same thing for all of us as we approach
the next two years. I was really struck about a month ago when I walked
down to the Lincoln Memorial and I read the Second Inaugural, which is
short enough to be on the wall. And 12 times in that inaugural, Lincoln
refers to God. I went back and read Washington's first inaugural, which
is replete with reference to America existing within God's framework. I
read Jefferson's first inaugural -- since he's often described as a Deist
-- which refers to the importance and the power of Providence. All of you
can visit the Jefferson Memorial where he says -- around the top it is
inscribed --''I have sworn upon the altar of God Almighty eternal hostility
against all forms of tyranny over the minds of men.'' </P>

<P>We have much to be proud of as Americans. </P>

<P>This is a great and a wonderful system. We have much to be ashamed of
as Americans; from drug addition to spouse and child abuse, to children
living in ignorance and poverty surrounded by the greatest, wealthiest
nation in the world; to a political system that clearly has to be overhauled
from the ground up if it is going to be worthy of the respect we want and
cherish. </P>

<P>I would just suggest to all of you that until we learn in a nonsectarian
way -- not Baptist, not Catholic, not Jewish -- in a nonsectarian way --
until we learn to reestablish the authority that we are endowed by our
Creator, that we owe it to our Creator, and that we need to seek divine
guidance in what we are doing, we are not going to solve this country's
problems. In that spirit, with your prayers and help, I will seek to be
worthy of being speaker of the House, and I will seek to work with every
member sent by their constituents to represent them in the United States
Congress. </P>

<p>


<h2>Setting an Example</h2> 
<i>Jan. 3, 1997</i>
</center>
<p>
<br>
<p>

I usually refrain from commenting on people before they have been formally charged, but the recent news regarding Michael Irvin has me thinking -- Is there anyone in the public eye left that our children can look up too. 
<P>
It seems that wherever we look, another athlete or movie star has had another run-in with the law. Whether it is Irvin's cocaine problem and the latest rape incident, or the late Snoop Doggy-Dog with his gangster lifestyle, our children are witnessing the demoralization of America first hand.  Each time one of their favorite stars fall, a child must lose a bit of faith in humanity. It must be an incredibly confusing experience for a young child to see the man, who's image is plastered all over their bedroom walls, taken away in handcuffs.
<P>
Even I, as an adult, was affected a few years back, when I heard that Magic Johnson was living a lifestyle that exposed him to HIV.  Events such as these affect more than just the participants - they seem to cheapen our society piece by piece.  It has gotten so bad that most parents wouldn't want their children to grow up to be President.  For our society to be at the point where the office of the Presidency isn't highly respected is a sad commentary on our country.  
<P>
NBA player Charles Barkley, who often gets into trouble on the basketball court, likes to say that he doesn't have to be a role model.  Baloney.  Being a role model is not something one chooses, but being a good role model is.  As long as we inhabit this earth, children will look up to and emulate those they see on television.  Athletes and other celebrities must just accept this responsibility along with the millions that get paid by the parents of these children.
<P>
Some athletes have accepted this responsibility.  Jim Harbaugh, quarterback for the Indianapolis Colts, always starts every interview following a victory with the words "I want to thank my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ."  This is something that my children should be respecting - a man who has succeeded in sports and still understands his priorities.  The opposite, once again is exemplified by our favorite good Samaritan, Michael Irvin.  After winning the Super Bowl, he was on national television swearing and using the f-word with frequency.   I was completely embarrassed to be watching such a disregard for common courtesy.
<P>
Parents already have a difficult task in raising their  children.  They don't need to compete with Michael Irvine and his flamboyant lifestyle. The sad thing is that Irvin and the Cowboys might just win it all again this year.  Wouldn't that be a great lesson to teach our children?


<p>
God bless you in your efforts,<p>

<h3>Working Journalists Eligible for $50,000</h3><br>
<hr size=3 width=50%></center><p>
</CENTER>
<blockquote>
Potomac, MD, November 12, 1996</b> -- The Phillips Foundation today announced that it is now accepting applications for the 1997 Phillips Foundation Journalism Fellowship Program.  Working journalists with less than five years of professional experience in print journalism are eligible to apply.  The Phillips Foundation offers one full-time $50,000 fellowship and two part-time $25,000 fellowships to undertake and complete a one-year project of the applicant's 
choosing focusing on journalism supportive of American culture and a free society.
<p>
The Phillips Foundation is a non-profit organization founded in 1990 to advance the cause of objective journalism in several ways, including this annual journalism fellowship.  The Foundation established this program to provide grants for projects to be undertaken by working print journalists who share the Foundation's mission to advance constitutional principles, a democratic society and a vibrant free enterprise system.  The Foundation awarded two fellowships in 1996:  a full-time fellowship to Stacy Mattingly for her proposal to write a book on a highly-charged school prayer case in northern Mississippi; and a part-time fellowship to Daniel Richardson to write a series of articles on the growing Patriot movement in America.
<p>
The three Trustees of the Phillips Foundation serve as judges for this annual competition.  The Trustees include:  Thomas L. Phillips, President and Chief Executive Officer of Phillips Publishing International, Inc.; Robert D. Novak, prominent national journalist and author of one of the longest running syndicated columns in the country; and Alfred S. Regnery, a Washington attorney and President of Regnery Publishing, Inc., a Washington, D.C.-based book publishing firm.
<p>
The Foundation is looking for journalism projects which are both original and publishable.  The winning projects will be delivered in four installments with the potential to be published sequentially in a periodical or all together as a book.<p>

Applications are now being accepted for the 1997 Phillips Foundation Journalism Fellowship.  Applications must be postmarked by March 1, 1997. The winner will be announced on May 6, 1997 at an awards dinner in Washington, D.C.  The starting date for the fellowship will be September 1, 1997.  Applicants must be citizens of the United States.
<p>
For an application, contact:  The Phillips Foundation, 7811 Montrose Road
Potomac, MD  20854, Attention: John Farley.  Phone:  301-340-2100.

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva"><B>Freedom.</B> That's the important conclusion of the <i>1997 Index of Economic Freedom</i>, published jointly by <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a>, the prominent Washington, D.C., think tank, and <a href="http://wsj.com"><i>The Wall Street Journal</i></a>, the international financial daily.
<p>
The <i>Index</i> proves that the path to prosperity has the same starting point worldwide: economic freedom. The higher a country <A HREF="/heritage/index/rankings.html">ranks</A> on the <i>1997 Index of Economic Freedom</i>, the faster it is likely to grow, improving the living standards of its people. The more a government interferes in the free market, the slower the economy and the poorer the citizens.
<p>
In addition to lively essays by Heritage analysts and editors from the <i>Wall Street Journal's</i> Editorial Page, the Index provides country-by-country analyses of the world's economies. With up-to-date data on 150 countries, it's a practical, readable reference on tax rates, tariffs, banking, foreign investment codes, regulations, and more. 
<p>
The  <i>1997 Index of Economic Freedom</i> is an indispensable handbook for anyone who invests or does business abroad. And it's an essential guide to growth for those who want to understand why some countries prosper and others lag behind.

<b>This was originally posted to the Town Hall Forum (#3474)</b>
<P>

    TO: MY DEMOCRAT FRIENDS <P>
    FROM: MARK F. (THOR) HEARNE, II<P>
    DATE: OCTOBER 11, 1996<P>
    RE: THE CASE FOR CHARACTER<P>
<P>
<blockquote>
"Bill Clinton would rather climb a tree to tell a lie than stand on the ground to tell the truth." So said an Arkansas official familiar with Clinton on CNN during the 1992 presidential campaign. Democratic Senator Bob Kerry has said, "Clinton is an unusually good liar. Unusually good. Do you realize that?" Senator Kerry did not make this observation during the heat of a primary battle but this past January in Esquire Magazine. Kerry is not only a Democratic Senator, but is also a leader of his party and Chairman of the Democrat Senatorial Campaign Committee. Senator Kerry knows whereof he speaks. 
<P>
Forget what this says about Clinton - what does it say about us. We are told that Clinton is leading by a significant margin in his campaign to be our next president. (51% to Dole's 38% according to last week's Wall Street Journal/ABC poll.) We are told that "character" does not count. We are told that a candidate's "personal life" has no relevance to the office of President and has no "traction" as a political issue. Indeed, we are even made to feel ashamed for raising the issue. (On July 15th Clinton said, "I think character is a legitimate issue and I look forward to having that discussion." But, whenever the issue of character is mentioned Clinton dodges the discussion by claiming any question about his character is a viscous, Republican-motivated "personal attack.") 
<P>
    Consider the current best seller list. A list which includes an astounding number of books about the
    corruption of the Clinton administration. Boy Clinton, Unlimited Access and Blood Sport are
    only a few. But let's concede Clinton the benefit of his denials and explanations. Taking only those facts Clinton has acknowledged, and even
    granting him his spin on these facts, Clinton is far and away the most dishonest president or presidential candidate in the history of our nation. 
<P>
    Let us assume that only 10% of what is reported about Bill Clinton is true. Assume that only 10% of the reports of drug use, rampant promiscuity, financial fraud,  and blatant violations of state and federal law are accurate. Assume only 10% of the Wall Street Journal's four year, two volume documentation of Whitewater, Travelgate and FBI Filegate is not innuendo and conjecture. Assume that Clinton's unlikely explanation of Whitewater is correct. (It wasn't a crooked deal to funnel taxpayer guaranteed funds from a Savings and Loan into his political campaign. Rather, we are told, Bill and Hillary, naive in matters of money -- notwithstanding Hillary's wildly successful commodities speculation -- were duped by the crafty McDougalls into a foolish real estate investment scheme funded by kited checks and illegal loans. Frankly, even if valid, I fail to find any comfort in this explanation. Do we want a sharp crook or a financially unsophisticated waif in charge of our national economy?) 
<P>
    Granted even these assumptions, impeachment should be likely, reelection unthinkable. Consider the following: 
<P>
        Richard Nixon's administration collapsed, Nixon resigned the presidency and Chuck Colson
        was jailed over misuse of only one FBI file and the related cover-up. By contrast, Clinton and
        Craig Livingstone spirited away the FBI files of their political opponents by the hundreds,  and the
        cover-up and stone-walling continues. 
<P>
        Spiro Agnew resigned the Vice-Presidency over charges of tax evasion stemming from
        $16,000 he accepted from contractors when he was Governor of Maryland. By contrast,
        Clinton has conceded that he filed misleading tax returns that did not properly disclose illegal
        loans made by a now-defunct S&L,  the proceeds of which were used in his campaign for
        Governor. The reason he was not charged with tax evasion was that he released the tax returns
        after the statute of limitations had expired. Equally well established is the fact that Hillary
        enjoyed more than $100,000 in "profits" from commodities trading orchestrated
        by Tyson Foods in exchange for favorable treatment accorded Tyson Foods by her husband, 
        then the Governor. 
<P>
        Gary Hart bowed out of the 1988 presidential race because of one wild weekend in the
        Bahamas and a sleep-over in Washington DC. By contrast, Clinton is being sued in federal
        court for enticing a young woman - against her wishes -- into his hotel room, dropping his
        trousers and suggesting she engage in a lurid sex act. Clinton's known sex-partners could form
        a single-file line longer than the inaugural parade route. (At least JFK was honest about his
        philandering. During a 1961 meeting in Bermuda with British Prime Minister Harold McMillian
        Kennedy said, "I wonder how it is with you, Harold? If I don't have a woman for three days, I get terrible headaches.") 
<P>
        Ginsburg is not a member of the US Supreme Court because he used marijuana during
        college. By contrast, during Clinton's term national drug use has doubled due to Clinton's
        eviscerating drug enforcement. Remember also Jocelyn Elders, Clinton's selection for Surgeon
        General. In addition to her crusade to distribute condoms (for which she earned the moniker
        "the Rubber Maid") and to have mast. taught in public schools, she campaigned for the
        legalization of drugs. During her term as Clinton's Surgeon General, Elders son was convicted
        of felony cocaine and crack distribution. (If she couldn't keep her own son from pushing
        crack, how could she be expected to reduce national drug use?) It is simply beyond belief
        that, with someone of Elder's views as his pick for the nation's chief medical officer, Clinton
        expects us to believe he truly wants to battle illegal drugs. 
<P>
        On a personal level Clinton acknowledges that he used marijuana but claims he "didn't inhale".
        Yet in an MTV interview with high school students Clinton states that if he had it do over again
        he, "probably should have inhaled." Roger Clinton described his brother's appetite for cocaine
        by stating, "He (Bill Clinton) has a nose like a Hoover." (Referring to the vacuum cleaner not
        the president who preceded Roosevelt.) But, we can discount this allegation because Roger
        Clinton, along with Friend Of Bill Dan Lasater, have been convicted of felony drug charges for
        the distribution of cocaine. 
<P>
    (As an entry for the "How'd They Do That" file consider this: Roger Clinton served only two years
    for his cocaine distribution charges and Dan Lasater served only six months. Roger cut a deal with
    the prosecutor to testify against Lasater. Lasater was convicted but pardoned by Governor Clinton.
    (Clinton says the pardon was so Lasater could qualify for a hunting license.) However, even as
    Lasater was being investigated for drug dealing Clinton's Arkansas Finance Authority awarded
    Lasater authority to underwrite a $30 million bond issue. An undertaking for which Lasater pocketed
    $750,000. The purpose of this bond issue for which the state of Arkansas awarded $750,000 to a
    drug dealer? An Arkansas state police communication facility. Clinton's pardon of Lasater raises an
    interesting point. Why won't Clinton promise to not pardon Susan McDougal (who is currently in jail
    because she refuses to testify about Clnton's role in the Whitewater scandal) and other Whitewater
    defendants? Clinton has already indicated a willingness to put the power of a presidential pardon to a
    personal purpose. Clinton has pardoned Jack Pakis a Hot Springs, Arkansas bookie and close friend
    of the Clinton family. 
<P>
    Given this, why is Clinton the favored candidate for president? Have our standards for the office of
    president fallen this far this fast? What does it say about us and our esteem for our nation that we
    would trust Bill Clinton with the United State of America. 
<P>
    A question should be asked of each vice-presidential candidate in the upcoming debate. "Would you
    want your daughter to marry a man with the personal character of your running mate?" Recall the
    question to Mike Dukakis about how he would view the death penalty if his wife Kitty was raped.
    Well, why not a similar question to Hillary. How would she feel if Chelsea brought home a boyfriend
    with the same character and integrity as Bill Clinton? (Some may be upset with me for bringing Hillary
    into the discussion. After all, they may retort, she is not running for office. Would it have been fair
    they ask to deny Lincoln the presidency because Mary Todd was a lunatic? To which I reply, Yes, if
    Lincoln had threatened to put Mary Todd in charge of the Union Army as Clinton tried to do with
    Hillary and health care.) 
<P>
    Two responses, and only two responses, are possible. One, all the charges against Clinton are false
    and Clinton is, in truth, a noble and honest - though much maligned - man. (This is the official White
    House position.) Two, the charges are, in whole or part, true but it just doesn't matter. Clinton's
    character is irrelevant to his fitness to serve as president. 
<P>
    If you opt for option number one, "Clinton is a wrongly- maligned honest man", than you probably
    also thought O.J. Simpson was framed. Haley Barber's line, "Clinton may not believe anything, but his
    friends have convictions - for bank fraud, embezzlement, conspiracy..." resonates because it is true. 
<P>
    Two-thirds of the Rose law firm, the source of Clinton's closest colleagues including his wife, are either dead under suspicious circumstances (Vince Foster), in jail after serving in the Clinton
    administration (Webster Hubble) or under indictment or investigation by a special prosecutor
    (William Kennedy). A similar fate has befallen many of Clinton's other top advisors. Housing
    Secretary Henry Cisneros and Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy are currently subject to an independent counsel
    investigation; former Commerce Secretary Ron Brown was a subject of an independent counsel
    investigation prior to his death; Clinton understudy and friend Arkansas Governor Guy Tucker and
    Clinton business partners Jim and Susan McDougal have been jailed for 24 count conviction for bank fraud and
    conspiracy. Clinton testified on behalf of the McDougals and Governor Tucker. After the trial, jurors
    told reporters that they did not believe Clinton's testimony and several jurors stated that, based upon
    the evidence they considered, Clinton was definitely involved in the wrongdoing. 
<P>
    It is simply not possible to consider the incredible number of Friends Of Bill who are under
    indictment, under investigation by independent counsel, in jail or awaiting sentencing and conclude
    that all the charges against Clinton are false. 
<P>
    Clinton apologists reply that it is unfair to paint Clinton with the same brush as his jailed colleagues.
    Democrat Senator Chris Dodd claims that to view Clinton in light of his friends is to engage in "guilt
    by association". These defenders argue that Clinton has just suffered the misfortune of being
    surrounded by dishonest people and is not, himself, dishonest. This explanation, even if credible, is of
    little comfort. Do we want as president a man so lacking in judgment that he has a profoundly
    uncanny ability to choose as his closest advisors a collection of crooks and felons. 
<P>
    Bluntly put, Bill Clinton is an unmitigated, dissembling liar. What Clinton says is meant to deceive not
    to inform. During an interview on September 23rd with PBS's Jim Lehrer Clinton said, "There is not
    a single solitary shred of evidence of anything dishonest that I have done in my public life." Most of us
    hearing this proclamation would understand it to be a blanket denial of any wrongdoing. Clinton
    clearly intended to communicate this understanding. However, reread Clinton's statement. "There is
    not a single solitary shred of evidence...." Clinton does not deny dishonestly, rather he denies that
    there is any evidence of his dishonesty. Quite a different proposition. Continuing with a further
    qualification Clinton said, "...that I have done in my public life." The injection of "public life" presumes
    a distinction with Clinton's private life. Given the mountainous evidence of Clinton's dishonestly, we
    can only conclude that Clinton believes using drugs, funding his Arkansas gubernatorial campaigns,
    funding his presidential campaign, managing the White House travel office and FBI files and
    formulating national policy are all part of his private life. 
<P>
    Option Two, "Clinton is dishonest but character doesn't count when choosing the President", is
    equally untenable. Consider the purpose of the election. For starters, this November we will decide
    who will take the constitutionally prescribed oath next January. A candidate for president does not
    become president by winning the election. The candidate must also take the oath of office and does
    not become president until he does so. (Recall the photograph of Lyndon Johnson taking the oath of
    office in Air Force One on the tarmac in Dallas standing next to a blood- splattered Jackie
    Kennedy.) 
<P>
    We do not make much of oaths now days. Yet, the men who crafted our form of government,
    founded our nation and authored the Constitution placed great significance on oaths and,
    correspondingly, the integrity of the individual taking the oath. A man's honesty and integrity were
    vitally important to our founding fathers. Thomas Jefferson, founder of the Democrat party, wrote,
    "We mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor." Of what value is
    Bill Clinton's "sacred honor" and to what cause would he pledge it? (Obviously not his wife, nor his
    country when called to military service.) More importantly, would you believe him if he did? 
<P>
    This is a more troubling question for my principled liberal friends. (Especially for those who make so
    much of Republican scandals whether it be Watergate, Iran- Contra or the Teapot Dome.) The most
    outrageous Republican is a piker compared to the mythomaniacs, miscreants and poltroons which
    populate the Clinton administration. (Will someone please tell me George Stephanopoulos's job
    description and how whatever it is he does furthers the legitimate business of the presidency.) 
<P>
    Those Democrats who support Clinton (and their allies in the media who overlook the Clinton
    scandals) have lost the right to ever again mention Watergate, Iran-Contra or any other allegation of
    Republican corruption. 
<P>
    Most liberals acknowledge Clinton's fundamental dishonesty. However, they appear willing to
    tolerate or overlook his moral failings because they believe Clinton will advance a liberal ideology and
    Bob Dole will oppose the liberal's agenda. But, in choosing Clinton as their standard bearer, what are
    liberals saying about their own integrity and the validity of their ideology? 
<P>
    How can the noble ideals proffered by the liberal be reconciled with the tawdry and untrustworthy
    reputation of their candidate? What does is say about the validity of liberalism that the adherents
    chosen advocate is a consummate fraud? In choosing Clinton as their candidate (a candidate who
    liberals support because they believe he will govern with a liberal bent even though he publicly
    campaigns as a conservative) aren't liberals saying that their agenda is best advanced by disguising
    and concealing their ideology and, by implication, recognizing that if American voters truly
    appreciated the liberal agenda they will reject the ideology? 
<P>
    If I believed I had a worthy policy to advance I would not choose an unworthy spokesman to
    advance the policy lest the message be sullied by the messenger. If I was trying to sell a drug to cure
    cancer I wouldn't choose Jack Kevorkian to be my spokesman. 
<P>
    Indeed, Clinton's failure to keep the faith even with political bed-mates is why two high-ranking
    administration officials resigned when Clinton signed the Republican welfare reform bill that
    he had previously promised to veto. Abandoning Clinton is the only rational response available
    to honest liberals who truly believe in the merits of their ideology. 
<P>
        Others don't defend Clinton but disparage us.  They argue:
<P>
    "So what if Clinton lies, uses drugs and cheats on his spouse, most American's behave this way and it
    is hypocritical to hold a leader to a standard higher than the standard by which we measure our own
    behavior." 
<P>
    While I don't agree that Clinton's behavior is characteristic of the typical American, I will grant this
    point for the sake of argument. Granted even that assertion, I dispute the central premise. Americans
    aspire to greatness and have always been an optimistic people. Our leaders should be the best from
    among us not the worst. 
<P>
     The political results of a second Clinton term are certainly to be feared.  However, an even sadder result of a Clinton reelection would be that a majority of
    Americans would seem to believe that a man of Clinton's integrity is representative of the character of our nation. 
<P>
    It has been said that hypocrisy is vice's tribute to virtue. Well, if so, Clinton should be Master of
    Ceremonies for a Telethon for Virtue. Within hours of being elected president Clinton proclaimed
    that his administration would be the most ethical ever. This promise was made in the context of
    Clinton's campaign attacks upon the Bush administration that it claimed was unethical. 
    Clinton called attention to a State Department official who allegedly tried to pull Clinton's visa file to document Clinton's trip to the Soviet Union; a trip that was made while Clinton was leading anti-American rallies overseas. Clinton was "shocked" at the Bush campaign's "outrageous" use of official personnel and records to gain an advantage on a political adversary. Ironically,  Clinton can not understand why everyone seems so outraged by the hundreds of FBI files on Republican opponents that he and Craig
    Livingston had squirreled away in the White House. 
<P>
    What does it mean when the victor of this fall's campaign will take the oath of office to lead our
    nation into the next millennium? For me I want to believe the man who places his hand on the Bible
    and says, "I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United
    States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United
    States." 
<P>
    November 5th is national examination day. The question is one of character. Not Clinton's character
    but our character; our character as a nation and as individual voters. And, if the answer is Bill
    Clinton, we all fail. 
<P>

The Business Leadership Council (BLC) is dedicated to free market principles, economic opportunity, private property rights, and individual liberty.  It represents businesses that are entrepreneurial, growth-oriented, and supporters of free enterprise, as



 opposed to those which want to protect the status quo or are seeking special government privileges.  Its members are business leaders who are willing to take bold, principled positions in support of issues such as limiting the size of government and expa



nding global economic freedom.
<P>
The Business Leadership Council has formed the Tax Alternatives Working Group (TAWG) in order to analyze each of the major competing tax alternative proposals currently under consideration and to provide input from a business point of view to the leading 



proponents of these reforms, to others in the Congress and to the general public.  The objective is to make a positive contribution to improving all of the alternative tax proposals; and to ensure that the various tax plans will be better able to meet the



 goals of promoting economic growth in a way that takes into account the practical concerns of the business community.

<title>ABIC - Term Limits To Be First Item of Business in New GOP-led Congress</title>

<h3>Speaker Promises to Make Term Limits
the First Item of Business<br>if the
GOP Retains Control of the House
<p>
</h3></center>
<p>
<i>This is the speech given by Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich on March 29, 1995 in the closing moments of the House Term Limits debate.  In it, the Speaker promises to make the Term Limits Amendment the first item of business, H.J.Res. 1, in the new Congress if the Republicans maintain control of the House.</i>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
I listened with great fascination to the extraordinarily articulate gentleman from Massachusetts (Rep. Barney Frank-D), and I tried to remember back to the platonic concern about the ability of one to argue any side of a question with equal facility. I looked up the word `sophistry'. 
<p>
A subtle, tricky, superficially plausible but generally fallacious method of reasoning. 
<p>
And I realized that speed of language is not the same as wisdom. Let me give just a few examples. 
<p>
This amendment does not preempt the States. It sets a cap. The Supreme Court will decide what that cap means, but the cap is not in any way worded to be binding and, in fact, in no way would change any of the current relationship of the States to their ability to do what they wish to do. 
<p>
I can assure the House that if the Supreme Court rules later on this year that the Congress need act, that we will visit that question and it may well be on a legislative rather than constitutional basis which will take 218 and not 290 votes. 
<p>
Let me say second that I believe this is a historic vote. I have been frankly surprised by our friends on the left. I would have thought, having been defeated last fall for the first time in 40 years, that paying some attention to the American people would have been useful. 
<p>
But I will tell you where I think we are historically. This is not a new experience in America. In the late 19th century, a radical idea emerged, that Senators should be elected by popular vote, that State legislatures should no longer select the Senators. This was a change in the Constitution, an effort to take power away from professional politicians, the State legislature, and return it to the people. 
<p>
It took about 20 years for the idea to permeate Washington. But in that 20-year period, it became obvious and even the most entrenched old-time political machine came to realize that in fact there was no alternative. 
<p>
I think term limits is a very similar pattern to the election of U.S. Senators. When it first came up, I rejected it. I am troubled by it. I think in some ways it is anti-democratic. I think that part of the argument is fair. On the other hand, from city council to county commission, to school board, to State legislature, to governor, to the Congress, everywhere in America the people say they are sick of the professional politicians, they are tired of
those who use the taxpayers' money to stay entrenched, and they want to find a device to take power back from the professional political class. They say it in New York City, they say it in Los Angeles. They say it in Idaho, they say it in Florida. Everywhere in America. 
<p>
Now, we are being visited tonight by the fifth grade from Cliffside School in Rutherford County, North Carolina. I would bet a great deal of money that by the time they are old enough to vote, we will have passed term limits, because in the end, the will of the American people is sovereign, no matter how much sophistry, and no matter how many reservations. The fact is that if over time in State after State in county after county the American people say this is an experiment they are willing to risk, sooner or later they will get their way. 
<p>
One of our good friends the gentleman from Montana got up and said. `This is the sound of the Contract dying.' Let me tell you, my friend, tonight 85 percent or more of the Republican Party will vote with the American people for term limits. My guess is tonight 60 to 70 percent of the Democratic party will vote against the American people and against term limits. We will go to the country in 1996 with a simple pledge. It will be a new version of the contract. We are not going to have one of these between now and 1997, but a new version. It will say H.J.Res. 1, Term Limits, will be voted on as the first item in the new Congress if we are the majority. 
<p>
The Democratic Party has it in its power tonight, if half the Democrats, only half, vote with 85 percent of the Republicans, term limits will pass tonight. It will take deliberate decision of the Democratic Party to deny the American people an opportunity, and we are not even fully passing it, we just send it to the Senate, then the Senate has to send it to the States. 
<p>
We are not afraid to allow the American people to have a chance in their State legislatures to render judgment. We are not afraid to allow the Senate to look at this amendment. But I can promise you, if the Democratic Party tonight defeats term limits, the Contract may have been postponed in one of its 10 items, but it will be back and when we have picked up enough additional seats in 1996, we will pass it as H.J.Res. 1 in 1997.

<h2>Term Limits Questions and Answers</h2>
</center>
<br>
Term Limits opponents often tend to ask the same questions over and over again.  ABIC has developed this page to help set aside some of the anti-term limit myths once and for all.  Below, you'll find some of the most frequently asked questions by opponents and our responses.  If you have any questions about this issue, please feel free to e-mail us and we'll try to answer your question, too!<p>
<br>
<b><i>"With congressional term limits, wouldn't we lose all that experience?"</b></i>
<p>
First of all, what has all that experience gotten us?  A huge federal deficit.  A spiraling federal debt.  Budget bills with little pork-barrel spending items that their sponsors know wouldn't pass on their own.  And a federal bureaucracy and a set of regulations that aren't serving the people and issues they were set up to serve.
<p>
Second, sure we have lots of members who have years of experience in that office.  But how many insightful intellects and energetic hearts have we lost because the process is so closed?  Who in his or her right mind would run against a 15- or 30-year incumbent?  Is Henry Hyde really the only person from north Chicago who can serve that constituency?  Is Vic Fazio really the only person in Sacramento qualified to serve the citizens of his district in the national legislature?  And if that expericnce is so wonderful, who's to say that it can't be used in another office, perhaps the other chamber of Congress or a statewide seat or the state legislature or even in the federal executive branch?
<p>
<br>
<b><i>"We have term limits--they are called elections."</b></i>
<p>
This assumes that today's elections are 100% open and fair, giving voters true choices.  Americans inside and outside the beltway know that the current electoral process is incredibly skewed toward the incumbent.  The financial and other advantages available to incumbents grossly tip the playing field toward incumbents, making it virtually impossible to have truly competitive electoral races.  The point of term limits is to open up the process.  Term limits will create more <i>open</i> and <i>fair</i> elections. 
<p>
<br>
<b><i>"What we really need is serious campaign finance reform."</b></i>
<p>
Everyone agrees that campaign finance reform is needed.  But that alone won't do it.  And no one believes that politicians will pass a law which makes it harder for them to win their elections.
<p>
There are several problems with some of the campaign finance reform ideas:  if you set a spending limit (the idea most discussed in political circles), instead of hurting the incumbent or even leveling the playing field, this actually helps the incumbent.  A challenger has to spend more than an incumbent just to break even: the incumbent already has much more name recognition, a franking ability, and so on.  Incumbents spend years serving their constituents.  When there's a flood, the local media interviews the congressman, senator and local officials to see what they are doing to help.  And so on.  The member communicates every so often with constituents to let them know what he/she is doing.  To a certain extent, this is part of the process of governing.  But it does give the incumbent an advantage that the challenger must overcome.  And spending limits will only hurt the challenger.
<p>
There is an interesting anecdote which illustrates this: Rep. Bob Inglis (R-SC) tells the story of his first campaign for the U.S. House in 1992.  Running against an incumbent, he was faced with all sorts of problems unique to challengers.  While the incumbent was invited to factory after factory, workplace after workplace, event after event, his campaign had to bite, pinch, scream, and kick to get invited to <i>one</i> factory.  Now he's invited to factories and workplaces all the time.  When he was running as a challenger, he had to spend his nights working at his law practice to keep his billable hours up to support his family while he campaigned during the day.  Meanwhile, his incumbent opponent was given a month's <i>recess</i> to come home and campaign <i>full-time</i>.
<p>
How does campaign finance reform help any of this?  We need <i>both</i> term limits and some <i>real</i> campaign finance reform.  And we won't get the latter without first having the former.
<p>
<br>
<b><i>"The 1994 elections proved that we don't need term limits."</b></i>
<p>
In the "revolutionary" 1994 elections, 90% of those incumbents who ran won.  In 1996, the rate was 95%.  The message to incumbents is: if you run, you have better than a 9 in 10 chance of winning.  The message to potential challengers is: if you run, you have less than a 1 in 10 chance--pretty poor odds if you're thinking about running for Congress against an incumbent.  Term limits are necessary to even the playing field.
<p>
<center>* * *</center><br>
<p>
The bottom line is that term limits will open up a process which is currently closed to average American citizens.  For example, in the current 105th Congress, 70% of the women serving in the House of Representatives were elected in open seats.  And 83% of the minorities in the House were elected in open seats.  Creating more open seats creates more opportunities for <i>all</i> Americans to participate in their democratic process and makes our federal government less responsive to the needs of inside-the-Beltway special interests and more responsive to the needs of everyday Americans.

<title>ABIC - Demographic Breakdown of American Support for TL</title>

</center>
<p>
<br>

In the first House floor vote on term limits, 82% of the Republicans voted <i>yes</i>.  Conversely, 82% of the Democrats voted <i>no</i>.
<p>
These numbers are even more significant when viewed in light of the wishes of the American people.  In January 1996, the Tarrance Group conducted a national poll of registered voters on behalf of the Term Limits Amendment National Campaign.  According to the data, 77% of the American people favor term limits while only 17% oppose the idea.  Of those, 59% <i>strongly</i> favor term limits while only 9% strongly oppose it. (See <a href="/abic/peoplepie.html.cgi">chart</a>.)
<p>
But most importantly, when broken into demographic groups, every group supports congressional term limits, including Conservative Democrats (who support the issue by an <b>80%</b> margin) and even Moderate and Liberal Democrats (65%)!  This means that the House Democrats were not just voting against the wishes of the American people as a whole, <i>they were voting against the wishes of their own voters!</i>

<center><h2>The Good Guys and The Bad Guys:<br>
The "EZ" Reference Guide to the House Term Limits Vote</h2></center>
<p>
There is an easy way to remember who the good guys and the bad guys are in the House of Representatives on the issue of term limits:
<p>
There are 35 Democrats who voted "yes".<br>
There are 39 Republicans who voted "no" (or "present").<br>
<p>
All other Democrats are bad on the issue.<br>
All other Republicans are good on the issue.<br>
<p>
If your Congressman is a Democrat whose name is on the list, he or she is a good guy.<br>
If your Congressman is a Republican whose name is on the list, he or she is a bad guy.<br>

Source: "Corporate Welfare Reform?", Janice C. Shields and James M. Sheehan, <a href="http://www.washtimes.com">Washington Times</a>, P. A17, September 4, 1996.
<p>
<i>Excerpts from the Washington Times piece:</i>
<p>
The Federal Government's Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) "doles out corporate welfare through direct loans, loan guarantees and political risk insurance...
<p>
OPIC's welfare for multinational corporations can be very costly.  As of Sept. 30, 1995, the agency reported more than $4 billion in outstanding loan guarantees and $10 billion in outstanding insurance.  OPIC estimates that $14.6 million of its outstanding direct loans won't be repaid.  In the event that borrowers default on the direct or guaranteed loans, the ultimate risk is borne by the U.S. government (read: "taxpayers").
<p>
To balance the federal budget and downsize government, Congress claims to be scaling back wasteful spending programs and eliminating others.  No so for corporate pork, which has somehow survived the cuts and will even grow faster.  The bill to reauthorize OPIC through the year 2001 nearly doubles the ceiling on OPIC's investment insurance to $25 billion, and more than doubles OPIC's financing authority to $20 billion."

<EM>A True Life Congressional Thriller</EM>. . .</H3>
<P>
<b>Chapter 3</b>
<P>
The Metcalf Amendment Reappears...<br>
....as the Thompson Amendment!!
</center><p>
In Chapters 1 and 2, we learned that ABIC has been following the disappearance of the so-called Metcalf Amendment. In July, we pointed the finger at the 67 House members who voted against the Amendment offered by Rep. Jack Metcalf (R - WA) to stop the automatic pay increase scheduled for members of Congress.  The House adopted the amendment and under its provisions, Congress would receive no payraise this year.  (Note:  Congressional salaries in 1996 are $133,644 per year.)
<P>
We also learned that when the bill came out of the Senate committee, the Metcalf amendment had <b><i>vanished without a trace</i></b>.  No one knew how it disappeared or whodunnit! In <a href="/abic/ptf/7-29-96.html.cgi">Chapter 1</a>, ABIC pointed the finger at the prime suspects.
<P>
While no amount of detective work will reveal how the Metcalf Amendment disappeared in the Committee, <b>the day was ultimately saved by none other than...<P>
<center><h3>Senator Fred Thompson (R-TN)!</b></h3></center>

<P>
In his floor statement, Sen. Thompson said, "The amendment we offer today is based upon the simple proposition that while we are asking the American people to make these (sacrifices), we must ask the same of ourselves...  We need to lead by example by showing the American people that we in Congress are willing to make a personal contribution to the effort of balancing the budget."
<P>
In short order, the Amendment passed the full Senate with a voice vote.  So now that both the House and the Senate have passed this measure, it is now very likely that it will clear the conference committee and become law.<p>
So, this week ABIC points the finger at a group of <i><b>good</i></b> guys: the six co-sponsors of the Thompson Amendment.

<H3>U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Finally Apologizes<BR> to Elderly Maine Couple in "Takings" Case</H3> </td>
</tr>
</table>
In a classic story of unrestrained government, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (ACE) has finally apologized to an elderly Maine couple for illegally seizing their retirement "nest egg" property.  In a July letter, ACE admitted that Corps officials "were clearly guilty of innappropriate behavior in (this) case."

After 10 years of legal wrangling in which ACE claimed that the property was a protected wetland, even though it was surrounded by a road, railroad tracks and houses, the Corps finally settled a lawsuit filed by the couple, the Roberges.  Worse, during the course of the lawsuit, the Roberges' attorneys discovered a memo signed by an ACE caseworker, Jay Clement, in which he stated, <STRONG>"Roberge would be a good one to squash and (make into) an example."  </STRONG>Apparently, Mr. Clement continues to be employed by the Corps despite its July acknowledgement that the case was mishandled.

This is exactly the kind of big government arrogance that insinuates itself into 
Americans' lives every day.  As Thomas Jefferson professed: "I own that I am not a friend of
a very energetic government.  It is always oppressive."   ... How prophetic!

<h2>About Americans Back In Charge Foundation</h2>
</center>

In 1990, the voters of Colorado began a nationwide revolution with their vote in favor of
term limits for Members of Congress.  Their vote was soon joined by 25 million more votes for
term limits in 23 states around the country over the last four years.<p>

Americans Back In Charge grew out of the original Colorado citizens' group, Coloradans
Back In Charge.  Founded in 1991, ABIC has been active in the state efforts by providing
grassroots support to other state citizens' groups.  Once those state term limits laws were passed,
ABIC Foundation was an integral part of the effort to defend those initiatives in courts of law
around the country, including the U.S. Supreme Court.  ABIC's legal project, the Term Limits
Legal Institute, served as co-counsel for the State of Arkansas when the Arkansas Attorney
General defended his state's term limits law before the U.S. Supreme Court in 1994.  Further,
TLLI served as counsel for the Washington state term limits group, LIMIT, when former House
Speaker Tom Foley sued his constituents in an effort to overturn the term limits law they passed
in 1992.<p>

ABIC Foundation continues its work of compiling information and analyzing the data on
the issues of term limits, the balanced budget amendment, and other key issues.  This web site is
an effort to provide some of that information and analysis to Americans who feel that these issues
are important to the future of our republic so that they may be empowered to put Americans Back
in Charge!
