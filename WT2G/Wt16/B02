<P>
Long held in high regard by the American public, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has 
managed to squander much of its goodwill in recent years.  The FDA -- wrapped in its own "red-tape 
reality" -- is now under scrutiny.  Democrats, Republicans, patient groups, as well as the industries micro-
managed by the agency, criticize the FDA for its inefficiency, bumbling bureaucracy, and cavalier attitude 
towards business and the American people.
<P>
Under Commissioner David Kessler's leadership, the FDA has become chief advocate for the "nanny 
state."  Centralized, government decision-making for medical consumers and practitioners is the rule of the 
day.  In 1992, Dr. Kessler declared: "If individual patients and doctors made medical decisions on their 
own behalf, then the rationale for the FDA would cease to exist."
<P>
The grand illusion that the government can effectively render personal decisions or highly technical 
determinations laid the foundation for the FDA's failures.  Indeed, the FDA's severe shortcomings, as 
outlined in the following pages, prove that the agency should cease to exist.
<P>
The Small Business Survival (SBS) Foundation continues to review each of the federal government 
agencies as to their impact on entrepreneurship and economic growth.  In terms of selecting an agency that 
drives high-paying jobs and growth industries overseas, the FDA tops the list.  As the FDA has made it 
more difficult to gain medical device and drug approvals, more and more companies flee for friendlier 
regulatory shores.  Lost investment opportunities, lost businesses, and lost jobs, make for a sad 
commentary on the FDA's lack of vision.
<P>
From entrepreneurial medical device firms to vitamin distributors and food companies, the FDA has made 
it known that it is at war with American business -- with consumer casualties mounting.  The new 
leadership in Congress is addressing the many tax and regulatory impediments to entrepreneurship.  Efforts 
are underway to reform and restrain the IRS, OSHA, EPA, and other agencies.  The FDA certainly should 
not be shielded from bold reforms.  In this booklet, SBS Foundation highlights not only the problems, but 
also offers common sense solutions to allow for America's great tradition of risk-taking and innovation to 
continue, while maintaining a check on public safety.

<P>
The U.S. federal government's alphabet soup of agencies -- including OSHA, EPA, IRS, FBI, ATF, and 
more -- seem to be coming under ever closer scrutiny in recent months.  These agencies are being 
examined in terms of their missions, tactics, strategies, budgets, and effects.
<P>
Included in this scrutinized soup bowl is the FDA, or the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  The FDA 
has set the standard for a gridlocked, costly, and even deadly federal bureaucracy.  The agency has gained 
infamy for its ability to throw monkey wrenches into the machinations of some of the most dynamic 
industries of the late twentieth century, such as medical devices and pharmaceuticals.  Indeed, the FDA is 
slowing medical progress, hampering entrepreneurial enterprises, and destroying jobs due to regulatory 
obstacles and bureaucratic gridlock.
<P>
The agency operates under a system of perverse incentives.  First, it possesses a monopoly in terms of drug 
and medical device approvals.  Second, since the FDA suffers consequences when problems develop with 
an approved product, the agency has every incentive to prolong the approval process.    Of course, a 
lengthy and costly approval process generates its own costs in terms of lost businesses, jobs, and lives.  In 
addition, the FDA seems to be plagued by assumptions that afflict much of our society in the late twentieth 
century -- namely, that all risks can be ameliorated in life, and that only the massive costs and bloated 
bureaucracies of government can assure relative safety.
<P>
In the following pages, we shall briefly review the responsibilities of the FDA, the agency's tactics and 
strategies, its impact on America's entrepreneurs, the FDA's budget, and finally propose some much-
needed, market-based reforms.
<P>
<hr>
<a name="three"><H3><CENTER>FDA History and Responsibilities  </a></CENTER></H3>
<P>
The first major federal drug legislation was passed into law in 1906 -- the Pure Food and Drug Act.  It 
forbade false and misleading claims about drugs, holding manufacturers liable for adulterated and 
misbranded drugs.  The Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 required that manufacturers notify the 
government before marketing a drug.  Companies had to test for safety, and if within 60 days the FDA did 
not disapprove based on those test results, the drug was marketable.  In 1962, new regulations shifted the 
FDA to a pre-market approval process.  In 1976, Congress formalized federal regulations regarding 
medical devices, and in 1990 codified FDA pre-market approval of all devices.
<P>
Today, the FDA carries a long list of responsibilities, summarized as: regulating drug, food, cosmetics, 
biological product, and medical device labeling; approving new drugs, biological products, and medical 
devices; setting drug, biological product and medical device manufacturing guidelines; and establishing 
safety and effectiveness standards for drugs, biological products, and medical devices.
<P>
<hr>
<H3><a name="four"><CENTER>FDA 
vs. 
Entrepreneurs 
and Patients</a> </CENTER> </H3>
<P>
As is the case with most regulatory agencies, the FDA seemed like a good idea at first, but it has grown 
into a massive, misguided undertaking.  The FDA has placed enormous burdens on food, pharmaceutical, 
and medical device enterprises -- discouraging investment and risk taking in some of America's leading 
industries.  The FDA seems more intent on exporting American ingenuity and entrepreneurship, rather than 
encouraging the production of U.S.-made drugs and medical devices.
<P>
Examples of the havoc being wrought by the FDA abound:<ul>
<P>
<li>In the August/September 1995 issue of Reason magazine, Rick Henderson reported that "the FDA's 
Center for Devices and Radiological Health takes more than three times longer to approve a Class III or 
'substantial risk' medical device (such life-saving products as heart valves or CAT scanners) than do the 
agency's counterparts in Europe."  What is the impact of such delays?  "In the past 10 months, reports a 
survey published in June by the Health Industry Manufacturers Association, 50 percent of the more than 
500 device makers surveyed had moved some clinical trials of new medical devices overseas; 56 percent 
refused to test new devices on Medicare patients; and 75 percent planned to move their trials to Europe."
<P>
<li>Thomas G. Donlan noted industry trends driven by the FDA's regulatory maze in the July 3, 1995 issue 
of Barron's: "The failure of U.S. regulation can ... be seen in the scrambles that have roiled the industry to 
put research and manufacturing offshore, to make partnerships with foreign drug firms and to merge and 
merge and merge again in an attempt to create firms that are large enough to weather all the risks of 
regulation."
<P>
Of course, market-driven mergers in an industry are by no means worrisome.  However, substantial 
industry changes being driven by regulatory costs should cause regulators and their supposed overseers -- 
i.e., elected officials -- to re-evaluate their regulatory activities.
<P>
<li>Robert Higgs, in a report for the Competitive Enterprise Institute, noted the hurdles companies face even 
when making improvements in already existing products or in their manufacturing processes: "Changes in 
the product or the manufacturing process, no matter how small, might cause the product to be consigned to 
an indefinite stay in preapproval purgatory.  FDA failed to differentiate between new devices and 
manufacturing changes for existing devices.  Manufacturers therefore had a reduced incentive to make the 
minor improvements that, cumulating over time, could greatly improve the performance of their products 
and the efficiency of their manufacturing operations."
<P>
<li>Higgs also reported that FDA policies and conduct have boosted costs for medical device firms 
considerably -- perhaps adding $10 million to $20 million to a firm's budget, as well as several additional 
years before a new device gets to the market.  Such costs greatly reduce venture capital investment in new 
and expanding enterprises making medical devices.  One can only speculate as to the total number of 
potentially life-saving innovations and inventions that fail to reach consumers because regulatory costs 
reduce potential returns to such an extent that capital simply dries up.<P>
Higgs noted that from 1989 to 1991, U.S. medical technology firms invested roughly the same amount 
abroad annually -- $321 million-$333 million.  "Then in 1992, when FDA abruptly made its enforcement 
and approval policies more onerous, capital outflow jumped more than 200 percent to $993 million."
<P>
<li>One also has to wonder whether large firms feel the FDA's battering as severely as smaller and start-up 
enterprises.  Rick Henderson asserts in Reason that large, established pharmaceutical companies have 
benefited from the FDA's regulatory maze.  New, smaller firms lack the resources, expertise, and patience 
to surf the FDA's regulatory tidal wave.  Hence, entrepreneurs wipe out -- the system results in fewer 
competitors for established firms.
<P>
<li>A 1993 report from the House Energy and Commerce Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee 
acknowledged the woes tied to the FDA's approval process for medical devices: "The situation is 
intolerable.  The backlog for pending device applications exceeds 1,100. ... The FDA's enforcement 
practices have demoralized and perplexed much of the medical device industry."
<P>
<li>In testimony before the House Joint Economic Committee Hearing on Technical Innovations in Health 
Care on June 24, 1994, Robert C. DeHaven of the American Electronics Association declared that the 
FDA's "inordinately slow" regulatory process was threatening "the global competitiveness" of the medical 
device industry -- a $70 billion industry with more than 11,000 companies.
<P>
<li>A recent American Electronics Association survey reportedly found that 40 percent of medical device 
firms reduced their number of U.S. employees because of FDA delays, 29 percent boosted investment in 
foreign operations, and 22 percent moved U.S. jobs out of the country. 
<P>
<li>FDA approval times have mounted.  For example, in 1988, it took an average of 78 days for the FDA to 
approve a product change (i.e., a 510-K application); by 1992, approval time had grown to an average of 
126 days.  This number further ballooned to 173 to 213 days by 1994.   These applications are supposed 
to be approved within 90 days, according to FDA guidelines.  
<p>	
Approvals of new devices take anywhere from 437 to 840 days. New device approvals, however, are 
supposed to be completed within 180 days.
<P>
Meanwhile, the median approval time for generic drug applications stretched out from 12 months to 38 
months between 1986 and 1993.  Of course, these numbers exclude FDA requirements placed on firms 
that extend development time.
<P>
<li>The overall time it takes for a drug company to create, develop, and gain approval for a drug almost 
doubled from the 1960s to the 1990s, from an average of 8.1 years to 15 years.
<P>
<li>When compared with many other nations, a clear lag in drug approval in the United States exists.  For 
example, from 1985 through 1993, just 27 percent of the FDA's new drug approvals received their first 
marketing approval in the U.S.  Between 1982 and mid-1992, 82 percent of new biopharmaceutical drugs 
originated in the U.S., 14 percent in Europe, and 4 percent in Japan; 86 percent were first tested in the U.S. 
and 14 percent in Europe; yet, only 25 percent were first marketed in the U.S. and 75 percent in Europe.  
Of all drugs approved in the U.S., 12 percent had been available in foreign markets for 6-10 years, and 
another 9 percent were available for more than a decade.  In the area of psychotropic drugs (drugs 
treating mental ills), 17 percent were available in foreign markets for 6-10 years prior to U.S. availability, 
with another 17 percent for more than a decade.
<P>
These approval lags do not seem to necessarily translate into enhanced safety.  For example, Great Britain 
gets drugs to market quicker than the U.S., yet safety discontinuations as a percentage of total new drug 
introductions were similar in each country -- 4 percent in Great Britain and 3 percent in the U.S.
<P>
<li>A February 10, 1993 Wall Street Journal editorial ("Kessler's Devices") explained 1992's sharp increase 
in medical devise approval times this way: "The onset of these delays is no accident: they coincide with the 
aftermath of the Kessler-Congress jihad against breast implants.  With that searing event, word went out to 
FDA reviewers that all devices were to get new scrutiny.  John Dingell added to the fear by inviting some 
agency bureaucrats to visit his re-education camp on Capitol Hill.  Reviewers naturally began to ask more 
questions, demand more data and stonewall applications.  The resulting gridlock has been industrywide, 
affecting everything from catheters to imaging products for advanced surgery, tissue forceps, surgical 
staplers, lasers, and so on."
<P>
Of course, it was subsequently reported that several studies failed to show any link between silicone breast 
implants and various ailments that had been attributed to them by the FDA and a host of contingency-fee 
lawyers.
<P>
<li>The FDA continues to be embroiled in a controversy over the approval of Ambu International Inc.'s 
cardiopump, designed to help revive patients in cardiac arrest.  It has been approved and is on the market in 
many other countries including Canada, Great Britain, and France -- while ambulances in Austria are 
required to carry the pump.  
<P>
<li>In 1990, as The Wall Street Journal's Brent Bowers reported (May 18, 1993), the FDA notified the 
McCurdy Fish Co. in Lubec, Maine -- reportedly the lone U.S. company in the smoked-herring industry -- 
that it would have to significantly alter its process for producing smoked herring.  Since the turn of the 
century, the company had eviscerated the fish after the salting and smoking process; now the FDA 
demanded evisceration before salting and smoking.  Never mind that in the 20 years that John McCurdy 
ran the company -- producing three million pounds or 54 million filets of herring -- there was not one 
reported case of food poisoning.  McCurdy could not afford to buy the new equipment -- the business 
closed and Lubec, Maine lost 22 jobs.
<P>
<li>For almost the past decade, H. Earl Wright has been wrestling with the FDA over his Sensor Pad, 
designed to aid women with breast self-examination.  The pad has long been approved for sale in European 
and Asian nations.
<P>
<li>The Wall Street Journal reported on April 12, 1994 that one company -- International Rehabilitative 
Sciences Inc. -- already had FDA approval for its muscle stimulators, but since the company does business 
as RS Medical, it sought clearance a second time in 1990 in order to clarify ownership.  The FDA denied 
the application and rescinded its original approval.  Believing it was mistreated, the company decided to 
test the FDA's process by re-applying and having its consulting firm apply as well.  RS Medical was denied 
approval while the consulting firm received approval.  RS Medical took the FDA to court and won.
<P>
<li>The chief executive of the Minnesota-based Minntech Corp., Louis Cosentino, best summed up the effect 
of the FDA on entrepreneurs and the U.S. economy: "The attitude of the FDA is so antibusiness and so 
negative at this point that any prudent CEO has to be looking outside the U.S. as a safe haven."  Minntech 
laid off 50 Minnesota employees while expanding in Europe.
<P></ul>
Meanwhile, the so-called benefits for consumers from all these added delays and costs remain difficult to 
detect.  In fact, bureaucratic delays by the FDA apparently cost thousands of lives annually, as products 
and treatments are being denied to American consumers.
<P>
<hr>
<H3><a name="five"><CENTER>Export Restrictions</CENTER></a>  </H3>
<P>
The FDA erects barriers to the export of U.S. medical products as well.  Even if a product has been 
approved for use in a foreign country, the FDA generally does not allow for exportation to that nation if the 
product has not received FDA approval.  Again, in the case of medical devices, a lengthy FDA approval 
process is needed in order to export.  
<P>
The CEO of a medical device company was denied permission to export by the FDA -- so he moved the 
company from the U.S. to Switzerland.  The CEO observed: "The FDA denied us permission to export. ... 
So we had to export our manufacturing plant." 
<P>
<hr>
<H3><a name="six"><CENTER>FDA Intrusions</CENTER></a></H3>
<P>
However, the FDA does not stop at mere incompetence and bureaucratic gridlock.  In the 1990s, under the 
guidance of FDA Commissioner David Kessler, the FDA's enforcement efforts have become increasingly 
aggressive and intrusive.
<P>
Reports abound of the FDA's confrontational methods under Dr. Kessler's reign.  For example:<ul>
<P>
<li>In the May 1995 issue of Reason magazine, analyst Alexander Volokh reported: "Since 1990, when 
David Kessler took over as FDA commissioner, enforcement has been one of the FDA's top priorities.  In 
his first two months, Kessler added 100 new criminal investigators to his enforcement staff, many of them 
formerly with the Secret Service and Drug Enforcement Administration.  Armed raids on alternative health 
clinics and dietary supplement dealers followed, as well as increased warning letters, product seizures, and 
criminal prosecutions in the drug and device industries."
<P>
<li>In the January 1995 issue of The American Spectator ("Double-Crossing to Safety"), James Bovard 
reported on the FDA's raid on Proctor & Gamble's "Citrus Hill Fresh Choice" orange juice.  The FDA 
disputed the use of the word "fresh" on the label, saying it was misleading.  Proctor & Gamble noted a 
survey showing that consumers knew that "Fresh Choice" did not mean fresh squeezed, and besides, "Made 
from Concentrate" was also on the label.  Bovard reported: "Kessler ... took sweeping action: He ordered 
U.S. marshalls to seize the juice -- 12,000 gallons, as it turned out -- and destroy it.  Federal law declares 
that a 'misbranded' or 'mislabeled' product is automatically unsafe, and provides FDA with the authority to 
confiscate the merchandise."
<P>
Of course, the orange juice was both safe and healthy.  Dr. Kessler's actions, however, sent a signal that it 
was "get tough" time at the FDA, no matter how ridiculous the agency might seem.  Power would win out 
over reason.
<P>
<li>Bovard noted another raid.  This time the FDA launched an assault on vitamins not orange juice: "On 
May 6, 1992, a platoon of sixteen FDA inspectors and local police in flak jackets carried out a no-knock 
raid, smashing in the door of the Tahoma Clinic in Kent, Washington.  They held the staff at gunpoint, 
ostensibly so that nobody could try to hide the vitamins.  The raiders seized more than $100,000 in 
products and office supplies -- including address books and diaries -- and spent 14 hours cleaning out the 
office; they even tore the phones out of the wall.  FDA agents were supposedly concerned about the clinic's 
use of injected B-vitamins, which have been widely used in Germany with no adverse health problems."
<P>
<li>Commissioner Kessler was appointed by President George Bush, but reportedly lobbied hard to keep his 
job under President Clinton.  Kessler worked to ingratiate himself with the president-to-be with a list of 
aggressive regulatory actions.  On December 8, 1992, during the White House transition, Kessler offered 
his view of the FDA in remarks before the Food and Drug Law Institute's 36th Annual Educational 
Conference.  His emphasis on re-regulation and more aggressive enforcement was clear, as noted by the 
following excerpts:
<P>
"We needed to send out a message that, ultimately, it was in no one's interest to deregulate a public health 
regulatory agency."
<P>
"We're paying more attention to our field these days.  We've become once again an FDA that vigorously 
enforces the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, and not just an agency that approves products and 
educates consumers and the industry."
<P>
"Our enforcement people have fewer hoops to jump through, fewer boxes that must be checked off."
<P>
"We rely much less on voluntary agreements and much more on court-enforceable consent decrees."
<P>
"To complement the regular FDA field force we've created an Office of Criminal Investigations, not to be 
confused with the new Office of Investigations.  Thirty new special agents began intense training last week 
at a federal law enforcement training center in Georgia."
<P>
"In just over a year we've cleared the deck of uncompleted and abandoned regulatory proposals; we're 
getting new regulations out faster than ever before ..."
<P>
Commissioner Kessler, of course,  kept his job.
<P>
<li>This time writing in The Wall Street Journal (December 8, 1994), James Bovard observed another FDA 
tactic: "FDA employees are also sowing fear with a deluge of official Warning Letters (up more than 300% 
since Dr. Kessler took office).  Once the FDA issues a Warning Letter, it can seize a company's products or 
get a court injunction to paralyze its operations.  The FDA has refused to establish clear guidelines or rules 
for issuing its letters.  As a result, manufacturers can find themselves in a nightmare at the whim of a mid-
level FDA employee."
<P>
<li>In a letter to The American Spectator (April 1995), Dennis Plank, Editor-Publisher of the FDA Hotline, 
writes on how well federal regulatory agencies work together when it comes to regulatory crack downs: "A 
frightening current trend is how successful the FDA has become in pushing the buttons at other federal 
agencies to attack vitamin, supplement, and herbal manufacturers and suppliers.  We have reported on 
stepped-up enforcement actions by OSHA, FTC, Customs, Postal Service, and the DEA.  The Federal 
Trade Commission has now become the FDA's bully boy with no less than twenty cases pending against 
vitamin and natural product manufacturers."
<P>
<li>One of the FDA's most aggressive moves just occurred.  It did not involve a physical raid on a company's 
facilities.  Instead, it amounts to the beginnings of a power raid on an entire American industry.  According 
to published reports, on Wednesday, July 15, 1995, the FDA declared nicotine to be a drug, linking this 
conclusion to concern over tobacco products being sold to minors.  
<P>
Of course, it is currently illegal to sell tobacco products to minors.  In reality, the FDA's declaration of 
nicotine as a drug lays the ground work for extensive control over the manufacturing and distribution of 
tobacco products by the FDA.  
<P>
Most recognize that smoking is bad for your health, as are so many other undertakings.  Tobacco, like 
other things, is a legally grown, packaged, and sold product in the United States.  What happens now that 
the FDA is calling nicotine a drug?  Are tobacco farmers and convenience store owners to become outlaws, 
part of organized crime, or perhaps pharmacists?  Are the FDA's enforcement tactics, as described above, 
to be extended to tobacco farms and convenience stores?  What about smokers?  The effect of the FDA 
calling nicotine a drug goes well beyond concern over youth smoking -- it is an issue of extending the 
control of the nanny state.
<P>
Indeed, why stop at nicotine?  What about other habit forming substances?    For those of us who are 
overweight and enjoy drinking caffeine-laden beverages, will the FDA soon classify cheeseburgers, 
caffeine, and sugar as drugs -- how about hot dogs?
<P></ul>
As government agencies often do, the FDA has proven to be both hypocritical and incompetent.  Dr. 
Kessler and the FDA would better serve the public's health by improving the efficiency of their medical 
device and drug approval processes.  Unfortunately, Dr. Kessler's reign seems more about control.  It was 
reported in a recent article in Business Week (July 31, 1995) regarding Dr. Kessler, "Even close friends 
wonder if the bearded Long Island native might not do better to spend his time expediting approval for new 
drugs and medical devices, and fixing other FDA shortcomings."
<P>
The Washington Times reported on July 31, 1995 that former chief FDA investigator Jim Phillips sent a 
letter to the U.S. House Commerce panel on July 14 saying a half-dozen projects had been placed on hold 
due to the agency's obsession with investigating tobacco.  For example, Phillips is quoted as declaring the 
FDA's foreign inspection program as a "disaster waiting to happen."  He told the Times, "For the better part 
of the spring of 1994, Dr. Kessler spent virtually all of his time on cigarettes.  I can recall several instances 
in which I tried to contact Dr. Kessler on important matters and was told by his secretary that if my topic 
was anything other than cigarettes, the commissioner would have no time for me."
<P>
<hr>
<H3><a name="seven"><CENTER>FDA Budget  and Employees</a></CENTER></H3>
<P>
When confronted with such a checkered and costly performance record, many FDA defenders will say that 
the agency is simply in need of more resources.  However, FDA budget and employment levels tell quite a 
different story.
<P>
Figure 1, on the following page, shows the FDA's budget authority for select years since 1955 in inflation-
adjusted 1994 dollars.  Budget growth at the FDA indeed has been robust.  For example:
<P><ul>
<li>Just from 1989 to 1994, real FDA budget authority increased by 52.6 percent -- or by an average annual 
real rate of more than 10.5 percent.
<P>
<li>Between 1970 and 1994, real FDA budget authority increased by 221.1 percent.
<P>
<li>And between 1955 and 1994, the FDA's real budget authority rose by 2,978 percent.  Though the FDA's 
powers were enhanced considerably in the early 1960s, an average annual boost in real FDA budget dollars 
since 1955 of more than 76 percent is incredible.
<P>
 Figure 2 (page 16) illustrates the growth in employment at the FDA.  Again, a shortage of manpower does 
not seem to plague the agency.  For example:
<P>
<li>Between 1989 and 1994, FDA full-time employees grew by a substantial 25.3 percent.
<P>
<li>Between 1970 and 1994, FDA full-time employees increased by 115.7 percent.
<P>
<li>And between 1955 and 1994, full-time employees at the FDA increased by 933.4 percent.
<P></ul>
<hr>
<H3> <a name="eight"><CENTER>Incentives Problem</a></CENTER></H3>
<P>
Considering the great leaps in real budget authority and employment at the FDA, it would seem clear that 
the FDA does not lack for sufficient resources.  Instead, what the FDA lacks are proper incentives -- as is 
the case with most government undertakings.  Costs and performance in government -- unlike the private 
sector -- take a back seat to concerns over expanding power, budgets, and employment.  Without a profit 
motive, costs inevitably rise and performance declines.
<P>
In addition, the FDA possesses every incentive to prolong the drug and medical-device approval processes, 
since the agency monopolizes these activities and can face significant consequences when a problem 
develops in an approved product.  In contrast, the FDA loses virtually nothing when businesses and 
patients suffer because of agency delays.  Businesses and patients who die from FDA delays receive little 
attention.
<P>
In summary, taxpayers and consumers are spending more to get less from the FDA.  FDA delays, added 
costs, export restrictions, narrow-minded regulations, overly aggressive regulators, and mounting budgets 
are costing the United States in terms of lost businesses, jobs, and even lives.
<P>
Real reform means reduced costs and improved performance.  That translates into greater private-sector 
involvement in the safety of U.S. food, drugs, and medical devices.
<P>
<hr>
<H3><a name="nine"><CENTER>Market-Based Reforms</a></CENTER></H3>
<P>
The list of FDA shortcomings is quite lengthy.  Much to the chagrin of Commissioner Kessler, the FDA 
indeed should be "just an agency that approves products and educates consumers and the industry."  In the 
regulatory environment, anything more seems to breed hostility, often insurmountable costs, over-
zealousness, arrogance, big budgets, and massive intrusions on the part of regulators -- such as seizures of 
orange juice and armed raids on vitamin clinics.  
<P>
Entrepreneurs in the medical device, pharmaceutical, and food industries meet the most essential human 
needs -- sustenance and medical care.  The costs and risks of improving upon and/or creating new products 
in such areas remain substantial -- including the potential of enormous liability costs in a legal system gone 
awry.  Unfortunately, the FDA has managed to significantly add to these costs -- not only through delays 
and additional regulatory requirements, but through unpredictable, intrusive actions.    Entrepreneurs, 
however, are not the enemy; they are the driving force behind society's great leaps in technology, new 
products and services. 
<P>
The FDA's philosophy should not be one of making an example of a company in order to send a signal to 
other firms.  Instead, the agency should build a cooperative relationship with some of America's most 
dynamic and crucial industries.  Unfortunately, the FDA seems incapable of such a massive shift in attitude 
and culture.  Former U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Louis Sullivan was correct when he 
recently noted in The Washington Times (June 27, 1995) that the FDA may be beyond reform:
<P>
"Instead of making yet another effort to reform a system that seems incapable of reform, we should begin 
thinking about the design of a new system.  In my view, such a system would require considerable 
decentralization, perhaps along the lines of the European systems, where non-government institutions play 
a much greater role in the process of reviewing and approving new medical products."
<P>
One should be somewhat encouraged by the fact that the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives also 
acknowledges considerable problems with the FDA.  In fact, Speaker Newt Gingrich went so far as to refer 
to the FDA as a "Stalinistic" agency and the "leading job killer" in the nation.  Under the FDA's yoke, 
entrepreneurs and businesses possess every incentive to cease research and development, shift operations 
and jobs out of the country, or close down altogether.
<P>
Bold steps need to be taken:  
<P><ul>
<li>The FDA should be scrapped in favor of a smaller agency geared toward safety and education.  
According to economist James Bovard, writing in the December 8, 1994 Wall Street Journal: "Rep. 
Gingrich favors replacing the FDA with an agency staffed with medical entrepreneurs, with strict limits on 
their time in government."  While one has to wonder why entrepreneurs would be willing to staff a 
government agency, the sentiment is correct.  
<P>
The Speaker's idea raises another question: Can FDA regulators ever be qualified enough to register sound 
judgments regarding  dynamic enterprises in, for example, the biomedical industry?  Tapping medical 
entrepreneurs is a good idea, but perhaps better achieved by allowing private firms to undertake safety 
approvals. 
<P>
The private sector -- medical entrepreneurs certified by the government -- is more capable of establishing 
an efficient drug and medical device approval processes.  Conceivably, the approval process would be 
contracted out, or preferably, companies themselves could hire private-sector entities for approvals.  
Universities, hospitals, researchers, and other firms could be certified by the government as drug or 
medical device approval entities.
<P>
<li>Efficacy should be left to the marketplace.  The government has a role in helping to secure consumers 
against substantial risks they could not know about -- i.e., safety -- as well as fraud.  Determining the 
efficacy of products, though, should be left to doctors, hospitals, experts, consumer groups, individuals, et 
al.
<P>
<li>Manufacturers and approval enterprises should be subject to the incentives of a sound legal system.  
However, huge awards for "pain and suffering" and punitive damages, contingency-fee lawyers, a plague 
of frivolous lawsuits, and much more, work against that soundness.  Product liability costs can terminate 
the life of a business, or simply extinguish it before an entrepreneur gives it life.  In such an environment, 
capital flees to industries where costs and risks are much smaller.
<P>
Industry often is regulated in one of two ways -- either by direct government regulation or through the 
legal system, i.e., the threat of a lawsuit.  Unfortunately, businesses must incur the costs of both systems 
today.  In the pharmaceuticals and medical device industries, the burdens of both government regulations 
and product liability are massive.
<P>
While firms should be liable for negligence or for misleading approval bodies, "regulatory compliance" 
and "state of knowledge" defenses should be allowed for firms that met all regulatory and safety 
requirements.
<P>
<li>The FDA currently disallows manufacturers from distributing information regarding off-label uses of 
drugs, such as independent studies and journal articles.  This dangerous ban should be lifted.  Doctors and 
patients need a steady flow of information about possible treatments.  Government, in no way, should 
hinder the free flow of information.
<P>
<li>A federal agency's enforcement powers, as well as its processes and standards for determining what 
products fall under its jurisdiction, should be scrutinized and reviewed annually by Congress.  Each 
individual policy decision approved by the President should receive the same examination.  Bizarre orange 
juice and vitamin raids should not be allowed to happen, nor should our elected officials be able to say that 
they were unable to stop such actions.
<P>
<li>The U.S. should negotiate and enter into agreements with other nations to recognize each other's drug 
and medical device approvals.
<P>
<li>Lastly, incentives for investment in dynamic industries, like pharmaceuticals and medical devices, need 
to be enhanced.  The aforementioned reforms are based on this premise.  Also, though having nothing to do 
with the FDA, one of the most productive steps that could be taken along this path is the elimination of 
capital gains taxes.  We have already noted the risky nature of drug and medical-device ventures.  High 
risks must be accompanied by at least the opportunity for substantial rewards.  A zero percent capital gains 
tax rate would help provide such opportunities -- boosting entrepreneurship, competition, and growth.
<P></ul>
The FDA is taking a heavy toll on the U.S. economy in terms of lost entrepreneurship, investment, jobs, 
and international competitiveness.  In a world where both capital and labor can move with increasing ease 
and freedom, the U.S. regulatory regime operates within an increasingly competitive global environment.  
A government agency that delays the approvals of beneficial drugs and medical devices to the degree that 
the FDA does, ensures that U.S.-based firms function at a severe disadvantage.  Of course, not only does 
this mean less investment, slower economic growth, and fewer jobs, but it also means that U.S. consumers 
often are denied access to life-saving  devices and treatments.
<P>
Competition can do wonders.  The U.S. regulatory regime acts as a severe drag on our economy.  Congress 
must act to make the U.S. food and drug regulatory environment more competitive on the world stage, or 
continue to lose cutting-edge firms and high-paying jobs to other nations.
<P>

<H3><a name="ten"><CENTER>Still Tea Time at the FDA</a></CENTER></H3>
<P>
On February 23, 1993, The Wall Street Journal ran a story on its front page entitled "Perpetual Tea Time 
May Come to an End for Top U.S. Tea Taster," written by Bruce Ingersoll.  That's right, the federal 
government -- more specifically the FDA --employs tea tasters.
<P>
It seems that since the passage of the Tea Importation Act of 1897, federal taxpayers have paid for the U.S. 
Board of Tea Experts, with part of the board's tab picked up by the tea industry.  As a department of the 
FDA, the board's essential duty is to ensure that imported tea tastes alright.
<P>
Though certainly not a budget breaker, the FDA's tea tasters well represent the government's cavalier 
manner as to how it spends money.  The Journal reported that the Board of Tea Tasters costs about 
$200,000 annually, with its top tea taster making $60,000.  Upon entering office, President Clinton, like 
Presidents Nixon and Carter previously, was intent on terminating tea time at the FDA.
<P>
However, SBS Foundation called the FDA's Brooklyn, New York office -- home to the FDA's top tea taster 
-- in late July of this year.  The U.S. Board of Tea Experts still exists, answering the phone, "Tea room."  
<P>
Clearly, the FDA's tea room needs to go -- an example of government waste.  However, the Journal did 
report that many have praised Mr. Robert Dick -- the FDA's now 80-year-old tea taster -- as an 
"unbureaucratic bureaucrat."  A private-sector tea taster for Redco Foods Inc. reported, "In my experience, 
he evaluates tea the same day he receives it."  If lawmakers ever finally muster the courage to turn off the 
teapots at the FDA's tea room, maybe Mr. Dick could give some pointers to the FDA's drug and medical 
device departments on how to speed along approvals.

</CENTER>
<blockquote>
I would like to thank Ray Keating and the Small Business Survival Committee, and commend them for the 
hard work they have put into this important booklet.  I unfortunately have been very involved with 
Superfund for several years now.  I am glad, however, that we have this opportunity to address the 
problems with the program and fix it the way it should be fixed.  
<P>
Soon after being elected in 1990, I learned that I had 14 National Priority List (NPL) sites in my district.  
After hearing dozens of real-life horror stories of what these sites were doing to small businesses and 
municipalities, I formed the NH Superfund Task Force.
<P>
We worked for about a year to study the problems and make some suggested solutions.  We came up with a 
series of recommendations which I turned into H.R. 4161, the "Comprehensive Superfund Improvement 
Act," and introduced it in the 103rd Congress.
<P>
While that bill addressed many different areas, the most important part addressed liability.  Specifically, the 
elimination of retroactive liability and the replacement of joint and several liability with a fair share 
allocation system.
<P>
This year I've introduced H.R. 2256.  This is significant legislation because it presents a road map for what 
I believe is the best way to make Superfund work in the fairest and quickest way possible.  My legislation 
will repeal Superfund's unfair, unjust, and un-American retroactive and joint and several liability system 
for actions that were legal at the time.  They will be replaced with a fair share liability system that will only 
hold people responsible for what they actually contributed to a Superfund site.
<P>
Despite the billions of taxpayer dollars that have been spent on Superfund, we now see that a mere 18 
percent of Superfund sites have been cleaned up.  This raises the obvious question of whether or not we are 
getting our money's worth?  These facts -- especially when combined with a GAO report released recently 
which says that only one-third of all Superfund sites pose an actual risk to human health -- make it obvious 
to me that we are not getting our money's worth.
<P>
So what is costing Americans so much money while causing these sites to sit idle for years with no clean 
up?  It is Superfund's misguided liability system.  We can make all the reforms and changes we want to the 
Superfund program, but if we do not fundamentally reform the liability system, we will be back here again 
having the same conversation in a few years.  Taxpayers are spending billions on lawyers while very few 
of these sites are getting cleaned up.
<P>
Recently the House Small Business Committee held a hearing on the impact of Superfund liability on small 
businesses.  What we heard were stories of small businessmen and women from all over the nation about 
how they have been brought to the brink of bankruptcy by this program -- all brought about by the current 
liability system.
<P>
We also learned that the Department of Justice spends over $30 million  per year on Superfund 
enforcement.  That's more than they spend on Clean Water, Clean Air, and RCRA enforcement combined!
<P>
In addition to this feeding frenzy for lawyers, the Superfund liability system has created an atmosphere in 
which the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) acts like prosecutor, judge, and jury.  They 
assume you are guilty until you can prove yourself innocent, and threaten you with huge fines and criminal 
action if you do not do what they say.
<P>
Once you have been named as a "potentially responsible party" (PRP) by the EPA, your journey is just 
beginning.  You will have to withstand endless EPA inquiries, endure hours of tedious work looking for 
old records from decades ago which may no longer exist, and pay lawyers to represent you and help prove 
your innocence.  Even then you are faced with third-party suits or insurance litigation to recover some or 
all of your costs.  
<P>
EPA and the Department of Justice have taken a program designed to clean up the nation's most toxic sites 
and turned it into a program that feeds the legal system and creates an atmosphere of where they have 
complete and total control over the fate of thousands of small businesses.
<P>
There is such a thing as too much government control, as we all know too well.  Superfund's liability 
system -- in addition to all its other failures -- has led to an out-of-control federal bureaucracy at EPA and 
the Department of Justice at the expense of hard-working Americans.
<P>
Another gentleman who testified before the Small Business Committee told us about how he had been a 
PRP for 8 years, and spent over $10,000 defending himself against a false charge.  Then, moments before a 
Congressional hearing on Superfund reform earlier this year, he was told by EPA Administrator Browner 
that he was no longer a PRP at that site.
<P>
While he was happy to have been let off, the gentleman was livid at the fact that he had spent nearly a 
decade and thousands of dollars fighting, only to be told before a Congressional hearing that he was free -- 
just so Administrator Browner could use it for political points and say "see how cooperative we are?"  Why 
was this man put through the expense and years of personal terror by EPA?  Why are tens of thousands of 
others similarly persecuted by EPA?  It is the liability system -- that's why.
<P>
In summary, the retroactive liability system in current law costs us billions of dollars ... delays clean ups 
for over 10 years ... gives government entirely too much control ... and creates an atmosphere in which 
there is absolutely no effort made to cooperate and in which the constitutional right of "innocent until 
proven guilty" is thrown right out the window.
<P>
The people of the United States deserve nothing less than a full repeal -- they deserve a clean environment 
and they deserve to be assured that their hard-earned tax dollars are going to clean up these sites rather than 
pay for endless armies of lawyers.
<P>
I urge my colleagues to examine every possible method to repeal retroactive liability before they take the 
final vote on Superfund legislation.  Holding people responsible for things they did that were perfectly 
legal is un-American, unfair, unjust, and must be changed.  Superfund is the most flawed law on our books 
and it is unconscionable for us, as legislators, to ignore a process which has destroyed so many people and 
so many businesses.  I urge small businessmen and women around the nation to take action now -- we must 
do what's right.  Let's not use a band-aid for a problem that requires a tourniquet.  Write and call your 
Congressmen and Senators now, and tell them you want fundamental liability reform in any Superfund 
reform package.
<P>
Best wishes.

<H3><CENTER><a name="two">Message from the President</a></CENTER></H3>

After years of watching billions of taxpayers dollars wasted, and thousands of small businesses legally and 
economically terrorized, the United States Congress has finally recognized that it is time to overhaul the 
federal law named "Superfund."
<P>
Since its inception fifteen years ago, Superfund has principally served not as a means to cleaning up 
hazardous materials, but rather as a feeding trough for lawyers and bureaucrats alike.  These individuals 
seem to care little about the environment, being more concerned with enriching themselves at the expense 
of innocent parties and unsuspecting taxpayers.  Through this booklet, "Highly Toxic: The Superfund 
Assault on Common Sense, Business and Entrepreneurship," the Small Business Survival Committee 
(SBSC) reveals Superfund's misguided beginnings and how it has turned into a surreal nightmare for those 
caught in its web.
<P>
Regardless of "good" intentions, Superfund has cleaned up only a fraction of the so-called waste sites 
designated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), despite the fact that the federal government 
and the private sector together have spent at least $90 billion on clean up costs.  With future expenditure 
estimates as high as $1.25 trillion, Superfund indeed should be closely scrutinized.
<P>
Practically every aspect of Superfund is a mess -- a prime candidate for the "dysfunctional-government 
poster program."  The EPA's criteria for selecting Superfund sites, its designation of "potentially 
responsible parties," and the allocation of clean up costs are all grossly misguided.
<P>
Over 17,000 pages of regulations have been issued in the Federal Register on Superfund.  Most 
disturbingly, the hand of Superfund extends retroactively -- unfairly dragging businesses, cities and other 
innocent parties into legal battles.  Estimates place up to half of the resources exhausted on clean up going 
to legal and administrative fees.  In particular, small businesses and entrepreneurs simply cannot absorb the 
large, inflated costs of clean up.  Nor can they afford to engage in legal squabbles that involve being 
targeted by the EPA as a "polluter."
<P>
Superfund certainly is more hazardous to small businesses, taxpayers and local governments than the waste 
materials it was supposed to clean up.  When the new Congress talks of reining in the unbridled regulatory 
monster, clearly Superfund must be at the top of the list.  "Highly Toxic" examines the history, costs and 
effects of Superfund in order to educate the public, media and lawmakers about a program careening out of 
control.  This booklet also offers common-sense reform measures to clean up a government program 
proven to be toxic for businesses and taxpayers alike.

<CENTER><H3><a name="three">Introduction</a></H3></CENTER>

Can you imagine the federal government getting involved in an issue for all the wrong reasons and 
eventually making matters worse rather than better?  Of course you can.  Indeed, many of us see this as the 
case with numerous federal government endeavors -- from various taxes, rules and regulations to welfare, 
education and health care.
<P>
In 1980, the federal government injected itself deeply into the process of cleaning up hazardous and not-so-
hazardous waste sites across the nation with the passage of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, 
Compensation and Liability Act -- better known as "Superfund."  Undertaken for the wrong reasons, 
Superfund unleashed the bloated bureaucracy and gross inefficiencies of the federal government on often 
unsuspecting individuals and businesses; turned essentially local or, at most, state problems into national 
woes;  set arbitrary and unattainable criteria for compliance; sent legal costs skyrocketing; forced many 
businesses to close their doors; reduced capital available for investment in certain industries; restrained job 
growth; and damaged U.S. international competitiveness.
<P>
Small businesses -- seeking out additional capital for growth or often just fighting to stay alive -- are 
particularly vulnerable to a Superfund gone awry.  Legal costs, expenditures for cleaning up sites to which 
they contributed little, groping through the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) bureaucracy, and a 
thick fog obscuring future costs and risks, can stop a small business in its tracks and even kill it.
<P>
Perhaps the most glaring problem with Superfund, though, is its mechanism for assigning liability to 
perfectly innocent parties.  Under this perverse federal legislation, if you disposed of waste -- toxic or non-
toxic, large or insignificant amounts -- in good conscience and in complete accordance with the law, you 
could still be held liable for the costs of cleaning up the disposal site if it later became a Superfund site.  
Notions of responsibility and fairness mean absolutely nothing under Superfund.
<P>
Despite massive amounts of both private and public expenditures, few of the waste sites targeted for clean 
up by the EPA under Superfund actually have been cleaned up.
<P>
Indeed, individuals from across the economic and political spectrums believe that Superfund has been an 
abysmal failure.  Differences arise, however, as to whether the program merely needs some fine tuning, a 
complete overhaul, or outright termination.
<P>
The following pages will provide an overview of Superfund's history, examine its impact on business,  
entrepreneurship and the economy, and offer much-needed reform measures.
<P>
<hr>
<H3><CENTER><a name="four">The Origin of Superfund</a></CENTER>
</H3>
As children, many of us read comic books that told tales of our favorite superheros.  Seemingly without 
failure, our hero gained super powers due to the fallout -- usually of the radiation variety --  from some 
industrial accident or government experiment gone awry.  The fictional hero would then go on to a long 
career of fighting crime, righting wrongs,  and battling various evil-doers.
<P>
In similar fashion, Superfund gained its powers due to the political fallout from a particular waste site.  
Unfortunately, in this case, fiction became part of reality.  Love Canal gave birth to Superfund.
<P>
Most of us have heard, at least casually, the story of how a private company's waste dump created an 
environmental catastrophe affecting families and children in Love Canal, New York -- leading to an 
evacuation.  Thankfully, in a recent article, CATO Institute economist Jerry Taylor reminded us of the true 
story behind Love Canal.1  
<P>
The company in question -- the Hooker Electrochemical Company -- "legally disposed of 21,800 tons of its 
wastes in the abandoned canal trenches of the area from 1942 to 1953."  The company chose this particular 
area due to the impermeable clay soil, which would protect groundwater, and its rural nature, limiting 
potential exposure.  However, the expanding suburbs of Niagara Falls started to encroach on the site, and 
the local school board sought the land for an elementary school.  Hooker initially refused to sell, but the 
board threatened to use its power of eminent domain.  Hooker fully informed the school board of all the 
risks -- including having them present at on-site tests.  Nonetheless, the board "bought" the land from 
Hooker for $1.2  
<P>
Taylor explains the subsequent damage wrought by the school board:
<P>
  "Hooker Electrochemical's careful attempts to contain the waste and warn of the site's dangers were 
immediately undone by the school board.  Thousands of cubic yards of the clay cap [laid by Hooker] were 
scraped away in the course of constructing the school and later during the landscaping of a housing 
development that was built on the site.  The board's attempted sale of the land in 1957 for residential 
purposes was vigorously opposed by Hooker."3  
<P>
Alas, Hooker pleaded to no avail.  The land was sold to developers, and the construction of city sewer lines 
breached the site.  Taylor observes: "What we have, then, is not a parable of rapacious, shortsighted 
capitalists putting profit above public health, but the story of a conscientious company whose best efforts 
were undone by shortsighted public officials who put immediate political return above the general 
welfare."4  
<P>
By largely riding public outcry over this misunderstood incident, the federal government passed the 
Superfund legislation in 1980.  As the reader will quickly see, Superfund is no super program.  Heroes 
cannot be found in this story, only villains and victims.
<P>
<hr>
<H3><CENTER><a name="five">The Superfund Prescription</a></CENTER></H3>

Superfund was built on the dubious assumption that the federal government should trump states and 
localities in terms of dealing with waste sites across the nation.  
<P>
Initially, Superfund was intended to force companies to clean up their hazardous wastes and to deal with 
"orphan" sites -- sites abandoned where responsible parties could not be found.  Congress originally 
authorized a trust fund of $1.6 billion for orphan-site clean ups -- thought more than adequate at the time.  
With the 1990 budget deal, the fund ballooned to more than $15 billion.5   The EPA -- with no objection 
from our federal elected officials -- greatly expanded the scope of Superfund.
<P>
In theory, the Superfund can be used to clean up a site on the National Priority List (NPL).  The EPA then 
tracks down "potentially responsible parties" (PRPs) and assigns responsibility and costs for waste site 
clean ups.  Increasingly, though, the EPA forces PRPs to undertake the clean up from the very start.  Non-
compliance without "sufficient cause" results in a fine of at least $25,000 per day.6   
<P>
In determining liability, the EPA utilizes highly questionable criteria:<ul>

<li> Superfund allows for strict liability -- regardless of intent or negligence.

<li> Superfund liability is retroactive, meaning that actions taken before the law was enacted still apply.  So 
even if firms were in full compliance of the law prior to 1980, Superfund still exposes them to liability.

<li> Joint and several liability also applies under Superfund.  Therefore, the EPA can require that one business 
pay for the clean up irrespective of the degree of its own contribution to the waste site and without 
consideration to the total number of contributors.  No concept of "fair share" exists under Superfund.  
Seeking relief, this unfortunate EPA selectee files contribution suits against other businesses connected to 
the waste site.  All parties tend to turn to their insurance companies for reimbursement.

<li> Indeed, current or past owners of a Superfund site who contributed absolutely nothing to the waste 
problem can be held liable.

<li> The burden of proof lies with the accused to prove their innocence rather than the EPA proving guilt 
under Superfund.</ul>
<P>
The EPA's main criteria for assigning liability for a Superfund site often seems to merely be "deep pockets" 
-- whoever is able to pay will pay for a site clean up.  Of course, this is not an ironclad rule.  After all, 
sometimes deep pockets cannot be found, in which case anyone will do -- including small businesses with 
the most distant relationship to the site.  And even if the EPA finds "deep pockets," these same "deep 
pockets" seek to recover their own costs by bringing contribution suits against these same small enterprises.
<P>
In addition, the type of waste disposed of at a site by a firm is far too often not factored into this liability 
scheme.  So a firm depositing fairly innocuous materials may still be held liable.  Indeed, the actual degree 
of risk for damaging exposure to hazardous wastes hardly plays into the determination process for a 
Superfund site at all.  James Bovard notes, "A study by the Congressional Office of Technology 
Assessment concluded that half of all Superfund cleanups 'address hypothetical risks rather than actual 
ones.'"7 
<P>
Also, the degree of cleanliness required by the EPA often falls far beyond the realm of common sense.  For 
example, waste sites need to be cleaned to "background conditions," far in excess of human safety 
requirements and beyond prevailing conditions prior to contamination; groundwater under a site must be 
made clean enough to drink (often technologically impossible); and dirt is required to be so clean that a 
person could eat (!) half a teaspoon every month for 76 years and not get cancer.8  
<P>
If you think such a system possesses enormous potential to develop into a costly, legal quagmire, you are 
absolutely correct.
<P>
<hr>
<H3><CENTER><a name="six">Superfund's Toxic Effects -- 
Dismal Results at Staggering Costs</a></CENTER> </H3>

As is the case with so many federal government endeavors, Superfund has fallen far short of its original 
goals while generating a host of new ills.  And these ills are felt by individuals and enterprises caught in the 
Superfund web, taxpayers, entire industries, and the economy in general.  
<P>
The overall costs are weighty:
<ul><p>
<li> Of the 1,292 "worst" waste sites on the NPL, only 237 have been cleaned up -- about 18 percent -- 
according to Heritage Foundation analyst John Shanahan.9  One should note that this is a most optimistic 
accounting of cleaned up sites.  On February 14, 1994, for example, Business Week reported that out of 
1,270 sites on the Superfund list just 49 "have been completely cleaned up."

<li> Yet, the federal government has spent almost $10 billion on Superfund and forced private parties to kick 
in another $80 billion.10  The average NPL site takes 10 years to clean up at an average cost of $30 
million, according to economist James Bovard.11  However, on September 29, 1995, The Washington 
Times reported it generally takes 8 years for clean up to actually begin, and then another 12 to 15 years to 
clean up the site.

<li> On average, transaction costs account for 32 percent of total private-sector Superfund costs, with 
litigation making up 65 percent of this amount or 21 percent of total costs.12  As reported in a recent 
Investor's Business Daily article (September 29, 1995), U.S. Representatives Mike Oxley (R-OH) and 
Sherwood Boelhert (R-NY) claim that as much as one-third of Superfund money pays for legal fees alone.

<li> Once caught in the Superfund liability morass, it becomes much more difficult for a firm to attract 
capital, make investments, and therefore, grow and create jobs.  Superfund's strict, retroactive, and joint 
and several liabilities create considerable uncertainties for firms.  Such unknown costs chase away 
investors and make expansion plans quite dubious.
<P></ul>
Small businesses suffer most under these added costs and risks.  Without the Superfund cloud hanging over 
it, investing in, starting up, and expanding a small venture is already a risky undertaking.  Superfund 
liabilities only raise the hurdles faced by small business even higher.
<P>
A survey of small businesses conducted by the American Council for Capital Formation confirmed these 
facts.  In a January 1994 report, it was noted that 39.1 percent of small business respondents reduced or 
delayed investment in plant and equipment due to being named a PRP.  Almost half of respondents with 0-
19 employees canceled or postponed investment.
<P>
The blow to the economy and job creation from this reduced investment are manifest.
<ul><p>
<li> Superfund also creates disincentives for investment in industrialized urban areas.  The threat of enormous 
liability discourages firms from buying land in and renewing long-time or formerly industrialized areas.  
Instead, it's safer to build new facilities elsewhere.  So many U.S. cities already impose large burdens on 
the private sector -- including high taxes, heavy regulations, bloated government budgets, and more -- and 
Superfund adds to these costs.

<li> Incentives are skewed for local governments and communities as well.  With the federal government and 
private parties picking up the tab for a Superfund site clean up, localities possess every incentive to push 
for clean ups to go well beyond reasonable levels.  They are not restrained by cost concerns, as someone 
else foots the bill. Economist Robert Hahn has noted that local communities often seek "gold-plated" clean 
ups as they reap nearly all the benefits while the costs are swallowed by a large number of taxpayers and 
consumers.13  Only when localities are named as PRPs does one witness restraint.

<li> Finally, according to a study by the Center for the Study of American Business, "Superfund imposes 
much more stringent regulations on manufacturing and other firms doing business in the United States than 
these companies would be required to meet in other countries."14  Most notably, in nations like Canada, 
Mexico, Germany, Japan, Great Britain, and others, liability rarely reaches entities that legally disposed of 
their waste; instead, liability is linked to fault.15  
<p></ul>
Individual Superfund horror stories abound, and the most horrific tend to pertain to small businesses -- 
those least able to afford or survive a governmental assault of the Superfund magnitude.  For example:
<p><ul>
<li> A small camera and film-developing store reportedly was held liable for the massive clean-up costs of a 
Superfund site in Glenwood Landing, New York.16 

<li> Hundreds of businesses and nonprofit groups, including a hospital, several public schools, and a pizza 
parlor, have been forced to pay large costs for cleaning up the Ludlow Sanitary Landfill in New York.17  
Bob Novak, owner of the Jolly Butcher Shop, had to fork over $11,000, originally destined for store 
improvements, because the glue from cardboard boxes he shipped to Ludlow was deemed hazardous.18  

<li> Formal Ware Rental Services of Tulsa, Oklahoma was notified by the EPA that it would be held 
responsible for the clean up of a local Superfund site.  Why?  Apparently for nothing more than paying 
someone $14 in 1972 to haul trash to the site.19

<li> Robert M. Cox Jr. lost his business because the Superfund liability scheme forced him to pay for the 
neglect of others.  He had to sell his furniture coating business -- Gilbert Spruance Co. of Oreland, 
Pennsylvania -- due to excessive legal fees and liability costs.  His waste had been disposed of at 11 
different sites despite an agreement with a waste hauler for disposal in one landfill.20  

<li>Kaplan's Careful Cleaners of Camp Hill, Pennsylvania was held liable for waste deposited according to 
the "letter of the law" 10 years ago at a site now on the Superfund list.21  

<li> H. Petert Nerger, president of Marisol Inc. of Middlesex, New Jersey, reported recently that even though 
his solvent recycling operations have not generated any wastes since the 1984 land ban under the Resource 
Conservation and Recovery Act, and despite the fact that previously the state told him where to deposit his 
waste, "our existence is threatened by retroactive liability."22  

<li> Automobile dealers in the Fresno, California area have become victims of what can be termed "drive by 
liability."  EPA bureaucrats reportedly put a former truck driver behind the wheel of a car and asked him to 
select establishments where he picked up used oil in the past and how much.23  

<li> In 1987, Eugene Ardelt bought the Mesa Fiberglass Products Company and soon after became a PRP at 
the Lowery Landfill Superfund site in Denver.  It did not matter that Ardelt had never dumped toxic waste 
at the landfill, nor that the previous owner's dumping was perfectly legal.  Ardelt spent $25,000 in legal 
fees and eventually settled with the EPA for $2,000.24  

<li> A small chemical company in Massachusetts -- Nyacol Products Inc. -- is being held as a PRP at the 
Nyanza Chemical Waste Dump Superfund Site because it currently owns the property.  This despite the 
fact that the EPA acknowledges that Nyacol had nothing at all to do with the site's contamination.25 
</ul><p>
These few examples fail to even scratch the surface.  Stories of Superfund atrocities seem endless.  And 
one should remember that while the costs are high for individuals and the economy, the safety benefits 
derived by individuals and improvements to the environment remain in question.  No one wins under the 
Superfund scenario of high costs and few clean ups.

<H3><CENTER><a name="seven">Department of Justice Defends 
Superfund Injustice</a></CENTER>
</H3>
It is worth examining the arguments made by Superfund's supporters.  These were most recently 
encapsulated on October 19, 1995, when Assistant Attorney General Lois J. Schiffer from the 
Environmental and Natural Resources Division of the U.S. Department of Justice testified regarding 
Superfund before the House of Representatives Committee on Small Business.  In general, Ms. Schiffer 
found little fault with Superfund.  
<P>
Indeed, Schiffer declared: "We believe that the Superfund liability and enforcement scheme has been very 
effective in carrying out the 'polluter pays' principle. "  As with all supporters of Superfund, Schiffer 
throws around the term "polluter" in a reckless manner.  No consideration is given to the intent of 
individuals and the legality of their actions.  If a small business owner disposed of a small amount of waste 
in a completely legal and ethical manner, for example, he becomes a "polluter" when Superfund is invoked.
<P>
Later in her testimony, Ms. Schiffer paints a picture of a government agency working with the private 
sector in full cooperation: "During the 15 years of its existence, the enforcement program has evolved from 
a litigation focus into a program in which most responsible parties enter into settlements or voluntarily 
comply with administrative orders, rather than litigating with the government."  Of course, mention of 
harsh EPA fines and threats of holding particular parties responsible for the entire clean up of a waste site 
go unmentioned.
<P>
Schiffer also praised a 1986 change in Superfund legislation which according to the Assistant Attorney 
General "prevents responsible parties from delaying cleanups by seeking judicial review and stays of EPA's 
remedies or orders before the government seeks judicial enforcement."  Of course, if one is on the 
receiving end of such "remedies or orders" the story can be quite different.  In testimony also given on 
October 19, John B. DeVinck, a car dealer from Superior Wisconsin, offered a slightly different assessment 
of restrictions on PRPs:
<P>
"My dealership arranged to transport used oil to [the Arrowhead Refining Company site] during a single 
nine-month period in 1976 when my regular used oil company was on strike.  I did not send used oil to 
Arrowhead during any other period of time, and have witnesses and sworn affidavits attesting to that fact.  
Regrettably, EPA and the PRP group who sued me refused to accept my supporting evidence and the 
testimony of witnesses.  With no jury or other fact finding on the EPA's part and no documentary records 
or evidence, they calculated the maximum amount of oil each dealership generated and assumed it was sent 
to Arrowhead during its 1944-77 operating life, assessing liability based on that maximum amount."
<P>
It was decided that DeVinck sent 31,855 gallons over the period 1960 to 1976.  Based on his own samples 
from various years, DeVinck calculated that over the actual nine months he sent his used oil to Arrowhead, 
he was responsible for about 1,000 gallons.  He has been involved in the PRP process for over five years 
now.  His costs include more than $100,000 in attorney and consultant fees, liability finally set at $70,000 
(down from an original "guess-timate" of $460,000 and then $230,000), plus $8,000 in interest.
<P>
In closing his testimony, DeVinck noted: "In my case, the $78,000 of cleanup liability I was assessed is an 
absolute travesty of justice.  The problem was that I couldn't prove a negative.  It was impossible to prove 
that I didn't contribute the huge amounts of used oil alleged."
<P>
Assistant Attorney General Schiffer also praised the fact that the 1986 Superfund amendments directed the 
EPA to select more "permanent" clean up remedies.  Of course, in many instances, this increases the cost of 
clean ups.  Federal lawmakers and bureaucrats clearly should not be dictating how far a clean up must go; 
this should be left to localities and the states who have a better understanding of local communities.
<P>
Some Superfund proponents have argued that Superfund was needed to establish a liability structure for 
cleaning up waste sites.  In fact, in her testimony, Schiffer inadvertently shows that no such need existed: 
"Before 1980, there was liability for contamination caused by hazardous waste disposal under the common 
law of public nuisance" and even strict liability "for harm caused by ultrahazardous activities."  She 
asserted that Superfund "was needed to provide response authority and funding for cleaning up hazardous 
waste sites, and to make rules of liability consistent and clear on a national basis."  With common law 
precedence and state or local government action possible, however, the need for federal action did not, and 
does not, exist.
<P>
Ms. Schiffer justified each aspect of Superfund's strict, retroactive, and joint and several liability scheme, 
as noted below.  Any true defender of justice should be disturbed by these justifications.  A response is 
supplied to each major justification for Superfund's liability regime offered by the Assistant Attorney 
General: 
<P><ul>
<li> Schiffer went so far as to justify strict liability under Superfund because, "Litigating 'fault,' as in tort 
cases, is extremely time-consuming and resource-intensive."  
Response.  According to the Assistant Attorney General's testimony, under strict and joint and several 
liabilities, justice seems to be sacrificed for governmental expediency.  This would be bad enough, 
however, in reality under Superfund, justice is sacrificed for absolutely no expediency whatsoever.  Clean 
ups take more than 10 years on average to be completed, while litigation costs skyrocket. 

<li> Retroactive liability rests, to say the least, on quite precarious grounds based on Schiffer's justifications: 
<p><ol><li> "it is perfectly fair to ask the parties who make a mess to clean it up;" <li> "the companies who created 
problems caused by Superfund sites benefitted economically from the manufacturing and other activities 
that generated these hazardous wastes;" and <li>"at least some of the companies who disposed of hazardous 
wastes were well aware of the dangers the wastes posed long before the public was."  <p></ol>
Response.  Schiffer's arguments supporting retroactive liability ignore the facts that entities not responsible, 
in any significant meaning of the word, are paying for cleaning up messes across the nation.  If economic 
benefit is a justification for retroactivity, then the retroactive liability net has to be cast much wider to 
capture consumers, various levels of government and taxpayers, other related businesses, etc.  And  if a 
handful of companies may have been aware of dangers the public was not, that is certainly no justification 
for punishing all businesses involved.  
<P>
<li> Finally, Schiffer argues that "joint and several liability is a longstanding common law rule that has been 
applied by the courts in CERCLA cases brought by the government, at sites where there is more than one 
responsible party and the harm is divisible."  She also asserted that joint and several liability is an efficient 
course of action, and if repealed would increase litigation costs.<P>
Response.  As for joint and several liability, Schiffer cites a supporting case -- Summers v. Tice, 33 Cal. 2d 
80 (Sup. Ct. Cal. 1948).  However, she notes that the defendants in this case actually "acted wrongfully."  
To say that a small business disposing waste according to the letter of the law and in good conscience is in 
any way acting wrongfully is a clear perversion of the law.
<P></ul>
When these shaky arguments are the best that can be mustered in defense of Superfund, serious questions 
should arise in everyone's minds -- especially our federal elected officials.
<p>
<hr>
<H3><CENTER><a name="eight">What To Do?</a></CENTER></H3>

As we have seen, Superfund's problems are numerous and substantial.  In this booklet's introduction, it was 
noted that disagreement exists as to whether Superfund was in need of merely some fine tuning, a complete 
overhaul, or outright termination.
<p>
The long and costly list of problems identified here safely rules out mere fine tuning.  Economics and 
common sense dictate termination of Superfund, but politics may require something short of that -- a 
complete overhaul.  The following reform measures are offered as a three-step process:<p><ol><li> short-term 
reforms, <li> a major overhaul of Superfund, and <li> Superfund's termination.</ol><p>
<hr>
<H3><CENTER><a name="nine">1) Short-term Superfund Reform Measures</a></CENTER>
</H3>
In order to get the Superfund reform process moving, several steps can be taken immediately that create a 
somewhat saner environment.  These include repealing retroactive liability for all actions taken before 
1987 -- eliminating litigation at an estimated 80 percent of Superfund sites; from 1987 on, basing liability 
on the proportion of waste a party contributed to a site; using science-based risk assessment and cost-
benefit analysis to determine required clean up remedies; and capping the number of Superfund NPL sites 
to gain some control over potential costs.

<hr>
<H3><CENTER><a name="ten">2) Completely Overhauling Superfund</a></CENTER>
</H3>
The following reforms would go far in overhauling the Superfund program:<ul>

<li> Completely repeal strict, retroactive, and joint and several liability schemes.  Fairness and common sense 
dictate that no one should be held liable for exercising good judgment and following the law, and certainly 
not for actions taken before a law was passed.

<li> Superfund should only assign liability to individuals and businesses who broke the law, who were 
negligent, fraudulent, deceptive , etc.  This is the only true "polluter pays" scenario.  To reiterate, parties 
that simply sent waste to a site in an honest manner, in full compliance with the law, should have 
absolutely no liability whatsoever.  In essence, they are not polluters.  So even proportional liability 
reforms -- where liability is determined by the amount and type of waste an enterprise contributed to the 
site -- while improvements over the current system, still remain fundamentally unfair and must eventually 
give way.
</ul>
If the federal government insists on operating a Superfund program, based on the dubious belief that 
individual waste sites amount to a federal issue, then funding should be attained from true polluters, and 
where no real polluters can be found, unfortunately, through federal taxes.  However, in the end, more 
needs to be done than a complete overhaul of Superfund.  Federal taxpayers should not have to pay for 
local waste sites.
<p>
<hr>
<H3><CENTER><a name="eleven">3. The Case for Terminating Superfund</a></CENTER></H3>

In fact, a waste site clean up is not a federal issue, unless, of course,  operated by the federal government or 
undertaken due to a new federal law or mandate.  In these two instances, federal responsibility is clear.  
Otherwise, waste site clean ups should be left as local, or at most,  state issues.  Localities are in a better 
position to judge the costs and benefits of clean ups.  If completely unable to carry the costs of a necessary 
clean up, then state government should be turned to for assistance.    
<P>
In fact, state and local clean-up efforts have proved to be far more efficient, timely, and less costly.  Local 
individuals possess a better understanding of their community's circumstances and needs than do EPA 
bureaucrats.
<P>
Indeed, the proper order of responsibility -- again,  barring federal operation, mandates or laws --  should 
be:
<P><ol>
<li>Private parties guilty of breaking the law, negligence, fraud, etc.;
<li>Local government action;
<li>State government action.
</ol><p>
The case for terminating the federal Superfund program is strong, especially at a time when Congress is 
seeking to re-establish a proper relationship between federal, state, and local governments.  True federalism 
dictates that those issues that can be dealt with at the state or local level should be left at the state or local 
level.  Not that these particular governmental layers are necessarily any more efficient than the federal 
government, but state or local officials should possess some better understanding of a community's needs, 
including the area of a waste-site clean up.
<p>
In the end, Superfund should be discontinued and the several taxes supporting it terminated.  This is the 
most responsible step the federal government can take when it comes to waste sites across the nation.

<P>
Washington, D.C. -- Pundits in the media continue to speculate
about Democrats regaining control of the Congress.  The Small
Business Survival Committee (SBSC) also toyed with the idea to
determine how small business issues would fare under the specter
of what could be ultra-liberal leadership in Congress if the House
and Senate change hands this November.<BR>

<P>
&quot;We're toast,&quot; said SBSC President Karen Kerrigan. 
&quot;I shudder when I think about the possibility of certain
ranking committee chairman taking control of the key tax writing
and regulatory committees.  The 105th Congress would be an unabashed
adversary of business and taxpayer interests,&quot; she said.
<BR>

<P>
According to <I>SBSC's Ratings of the 104th Congress</I>, the
leadership and ranking members slated for committee chairmanship
if the Democrats take control in the House are classified in the
hostile category.  The average score of these possible chairmen
and the party's leadership is an abysmal 2.3% out of 100%.  A
list of those members and their respective SBSC rating are as
follows:<BR>

<P>
<I><B>Average SBSC Rating        2.3%<BR>
</B></I>
<P>
The average rating of current committee chairmen in the House
is 86.4%.  In the Senate, where long-time foes of small business
like Senator Ted Kennedy would chair the Labor and Human Resource
Committee if Democrats took control, the current SBSC average
is 80%.<BR>
<P>
According to SBSC, the ratings of committee chairmen are very
important because individuals in these powerful positions determine
the legislative agenda of the committee.  They can advance proposals
that either hurt or help small businesses and entrepreneurs.<BR>
<P>
&quot;If Democrats take control they will owe, big time, the special
interests groups that spent hundreds of millions of dollars to
buy back the majority,&quot; said Kerrigan.  These groups -- big
labor, radical environmentalists, and other members of the more
spending/ big government coalition -- would expect the Democrats
to implement their far left agenda.  That agenda, consisting of
higher taxes, government-run health care and a massive expansion
of the regulatory state, would disproportionately fall on small
businesses according to SBSC.<BR>

<P>
<CENTER><B>Tax Pledge to Small Business A Decisive Factor in '96<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<hr>
<P>
<B>Washington, D.C.</B> -- Taxes will remain the number one issue for small businesses in the 1996 elections, and individuals seeking public office who pledge not to raise taxes while advocating fundamental tax reform will fare better with this large and growing constituency according to a national small business advocacy organization.
<P>
"With high taxes and a burdensome tax system impeding the growth and survival of small businesses at ever stage of their development, you can bet that this issue will be a priority for each and every small business person who votes on November 5," said Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC) President Karen Kerrigan.
<P>
Kerrigan made her remarks on Capitol Hill today at a press conference with a coalition of groups supporting the Taxpayer Protection Pledge -- an effort sponsored by Americans for Tax Reform.  When signed by a Member of Congress or candidate for public office, the Pledge commits the signer to oppose and vote against any effort to raise the federal income tax on individuals or corporations.
<P>
"In 1992 Bill Clinton promised a middle-class tax cut, instead middle-class small business owners got hit with the biggest tax increase in history.  President Clinton made a campaign promise to cut taxes, instead he raised them.  Taking the Pledge separates the true friend of the taxpayer from the big tax and spenders," said Kerrigan.
<P>
According to SBSC, small business owners are drawn towards elected officials and candidates who support tax system reform -- changes that would encourage risk-taking, investment and job creation rather than the attributes of the current system which punish entrepreneurial activities.
<P>
"Taxes are still a hot issue despite what the political pundits say.  Pledge signers, and those who make tax reform a key issue of their campaign have a tremendous advantage over their political challengers," added Kerrigan.
<P>
SBSC is a nationwide, nonpartisan small business advocacy organization.  For additional information please call <B>Renee Stikes</B> at<B> (202)-785-0238</B>.

<CENTER><B>COMMEMORATING ANNIVERSARY OF CLINTON TAX ADMISSION
<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
<B>WASHINGTON, D.C. </B>--  President Clinton returned to Houston,
Texas, today approaching the one year anniversary of his repentant
statement about the 1993 tax hike:<BR>
<P>
<B>&quot;Probably there are people in this room, still mad at
me at that budget because you think I raised your taxes too much.
 It might surprise you to know that I think I raised them too
much too.&quot; -- Bill Clinton, at a Houston fund-raiser, October
17, 1995.<BR>
</B>
<P>
Bill Clinton first claimed he was a tax cutter.  Then he launched
the single largest tax increase in American history, $265 billion.
 He said he would cut taxes on the middle-class.  Instead, he
hit middle-class small business owners with a punishing tax increase.
<BR>
<P>
&quot;Bill Clinton is a proven tax-cut dodger,&quot; said Karen
Kerrigan, President, Small Business Survival Committee, a Washington,
D.C.-based small business advocacy organization.  &quot;In 1992,
he convinced American taxpayers that he's a tax cutter.  He told
them that he is their friend and with him at the helm of government
economic relief would be arriving in the form of a tax cut.  After
he got in office, he felt our pain by delivering a body blow to
the American taxpayer in the form of a $265 billion tax increase.
 The largest tax increase in history and one that bludgeoned small
businesses!&quot;<BR>
<P>
Bill Clinton now wants us to believe that he won't raise taxes
in a second term.  He told CBS's <I>60</I> <I>Minutes</I>, &quot;I'm
willing to pledge right now that I, I have no intention of raising
taxes.&quot;  (8/18/96)<BR>
<P>
In 1992 Bill Clinton's intention was to cut taxes.  Now his intention
is not to raise them.  Bill Clinton reminded us all that &quot;Fool
me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me.&quot;  (10/28/92).
 Bill Clinton is a tax and spend liberal.  In his second term
he will raise taxes.  If the American taxpayer liked Clinton's
&quot;middle-class tax relief,&quot; they'll love his &quot;targeted
tax cuts.&quot;  Certainly small businesses won't be fooled by
more election-year promises by a proven tax hiker.
<P>
   
<P>
Back in Houston, President Clinton needs to be reminded that once
he was right.  &quot;I raised [taxes] too much...&quot;<BR>
<BR>

<CENTER>Small Business Says Thank You to 104th<BR>
</CENTER>
</b>
<hr>
<P>
Washington, D.C. -- The Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC)
today joined a coalition of taxpayer, consumer and senior organizations
to express their thanks to the 104th Congress.  SBSC is specifically
gratified for initiatives undertaken and passed to help entrepreneurs
and small businesses.<BR>
<P>
&quot;Looking back at the last two years, the 104th Congress passed
historical measures to help small business and promote entrepreneurship,&quot;
said SBSC President Karen Kerrigan.<BR>
<P>
The &quot;Salute to the 104th Congress&quot; event was held on
Capitol Hill today to thank Members both individually and collectively
for their bold steps to help protect entrepreneurs and encourage
small business start-ups.  SBSC joined Americans for Tax Reform,
Citizens Against Government Waste, Seniors Coalition, Chamber
of Commerce and other groups in sponsoring the event.  House Speaker
Newt Gingrich and other members of the House leadership were on
hand to address those attending the recognition ceremonies.<BR>
<P>
SBSC praised Republican-led reforms which were signed by the President.
 They also thanked Congress for passing a comprehensive small
business agenda yet vetoed by Clinton.  Among the reforms passed
by the House and either vetoed or opposed by the President:  capital
gains tax reduction, estate tax reform, comprehensive regulatory
relief, legal reform, the TEAM Act and property rights protection.
<BR>
<P>
&quot;While we are pleased that President Clinton signed several
of the initiatives targeted to help small businesses, unfortunately
he vetoed or stood in the way of other reform priorities recommended
by his own White House Conference on Small Business,&quot; added
Kerrigan.<BR>
<P>
SBSC applauded the Congress for its passage of health insurance
reforms to help small business including the phasing-in of deductibility
to 80 percent, and passing Medical Savings Accounts.  In addition,
regulators are now more accountable to small businesses because
Congress put teeth into Regulatory Flexibility.  Regulators must
also publish their rules and regulations in &quot;Plain English&quot;
and Congress can now conduct a final review of regulations and
vote to reject them.<BR>
<P>
&quot;Most importantly, the 104th Congress began to chip away
at the old status quo through its cuts in wasteful government
spending to balance the budget.  The two words that were dropped
from President Clinton's vocabulary after the '92 elections were
'Balanced Budget' until the 104th Congress came to town,&quot;
remarked Kerrigan.<BR>
<P>
In conclusion, SBSC has given the 104th Congress high marks for
its bold agenda.  &quot;No big tax increases like 1993, no attempts
for a government take-over of the health care system and making
small businesses pay for it like 1994 -- the 104th Congress initiated
mostly positive steps to encourage job creation and small business
growth and start-ups,&quot; Kerrigan concluded.<BR>
<P>

<CENTER><B>Clinton Land Grab Called Shameful By Small Business
Group<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<hr>
<P>
Washington, D.C. -- Small Business Survival Committee
(SBSC) President Karen Kerrigan made the following statement in
response to President Clinton's election-year land grab of southern
Utah:<BR>
<P>
&quot;President Clinton is getting a little too generous
during this election season.  On the campaign trail he has been
promising cradle-to-grave programs while doling out pork in key
electoral battleground states.<BR>
<P>
But his generosity has gone a little too far this
week.  Knowing that Utah will not fall into the Democratic column,
he has conveniently sacrificed the property rights of voters in
the state to placate environmental groups that need a return on
investment for their election-year financial support.<BR>
<P>
By executive fiat, the President has blatantly circumvented
the Congress to create a national monument without regard to the
job impact such a move would have on Utah's residents.  President
Clinton has consulted only with environmentalists on the land-grab,
and has even ignored and usurped his own Interior Department.
<BR>
<P>
It is clear that if President Clinton is bold enough
to make such moves leading up to the November elections, a second
term in office would mean a severe erosion of already-endangered
private property rights.<BR>
<P>
Utah residents, lawmakers and businesses are capable
of environmental stewardship.  They do not need President Clinton
-- or his cash supporters in the environmental movement -- to
tell them how to run their state.&quot;<BR>
<P>
President Clinton used his powers under the Antiquities
Act of 1906 to proclaim that 1.8 million acres of Utah will be
given protected status as a national monument.

<P>
 Small Business Advocate Applauds Senate Labor &amp; Human Resource
Committee<BR>
<P>
Washington, D.C. -- Today, the Senate Labor and Human Resource
Committee is holding an oversight hearing of the National Labor
Relations Board.  In response to the hearing, Small Business Survival
Committee president, Karen Kerrigan, made the following statement:
<BR>
<P>
&quot;The Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC) calls on the
National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to cease its open agenda
of union activism, and to work toward balanced enforcement of
the labor laws.  Rather than acting as an objective and independent
agency, the NLRB has assumed the appearance of a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the AFL-CIO.<BR>
<P>
Since 1994, Clinton appointees to the National Labor Relations
Board have waged an unprecedented assault on small businesses.
 Most notoriously, the Board's proposed &quot;single location
bargaining unit rule&quot; would limit the rights of employers
while promoting unionization of small businesses.<BR>
<P>
Less well known but equally hostile to small business owners,
is the enforcement policy of the General Counsel.  The illicit
union tactics known as salting and corporate campaigns have been
tolerated and tacitly promoted by this Board.  Unions have been
able to wear down small businesses through the filing of frivolous
charges with the NLRB.  The agency has been quick to adopt novel
union theories of labor law violations, yet slow to dismiss even
the most baseless of charges against employers.  The result has
been exorbitant legal expenses, increased labor-management hostility,
and declining respect for this independent agency.<BR>
<P>
The public recognizes the importance of small business to the
economy, and to the lives of millions of working Americans.  The
public has the right to know of this government-endorsed program
of labor union promotion.  SBSC hails today's hearing of the Senate
Labor &amp; Human Resources Committee as the first step toward
ending the NLRB's assault on small business and its workers.&quot;

<b><CENTER>Small Businesses Harboring Chemical Weapons?</CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER>American Businesses To Be Subjected to Foreign Inspections
Under Proposed Chemical Weapons Convention<BR>
</CENTER>
</b>
<hr>
<P>
Washington, D.C. -- The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) has
goals worth supporting, but in the end it will harm U.S. national
security while subjecting private industry -- many of which are
small businesses -- to onerous new regulatory burdens, on-site
inspections by a new foreign entity with the real potential for
international industrial espionage, according to a small business
watchdog group.  The U.S. Senate has scheduled a CWC ratification
vote on September 14.<BR>
<P>
&quot;Our assessment of the CWC is one of great apprehension and
concern for U.S. businesses.  We urge the U.S. Senate to take
a careful look at the treaty in terms of what American business
will be subjected to, and how our competitiveness is threatened
by new reporting requirements and on-site visits by Hague-based
foreign inspectors,&quot; commented Karen Kerrigan, President
of the Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC).<BR>
<P>
Nations that sign the CWC will agree to abide by the treaty whose
goals are to end the production and stockpiling of chemical weapons.
 Unfortunately, rogue nations like Iraq, Libya, Syria and North
Korea are not planning to sign the treaty.  Moreover, defense
and foreign policy experts view the CWC as non-enforceable and
non-verifiable.<BR>
<P>
As then-Director of the Central Intelligence Agency James Woolsey
stated before the Foreign Relations Committee in June of 1994:
  &quot;The chemical weapons problem is so difficult from an intelligence
perspective that I cannot state that we have high confidence in
our ability to detect noncompliance, especially on a  small scale.&quot;
<BR>
<P>
In order to comply with CWC provisions, new regulatory burdens
would be placed on already over-regulated U.S. businesses.  In
particular:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>U.S. private industry would be subjected to foreign inspections
at the direction of  Technical Secretariat overseeing the Organization
for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) located in the
Hague, Netherlands.
<LI>Businesses must prove to the U.S. government and international
inspectors that they are not producing or stockpiling chemical
weapons.  Chemical companies plus other businesses that use certain
chemicals in manufacturing processes must fill out new forms for
each chemical covered by the treaty.  Firms in food processing,
pharmaceutical, paint, petroleum, biotech, electronics, textiles,
rubber, brewing and distilling industries would be impacted as
well.
<LI>The. U.S. Department of Commerce estimates that it will take
anywhere from 2.5 - 9 hours to fill out the paperwork for each
chemical depending upon its classification.
<LI>Congress's Office of Technology Assessment estimated that
inspections will cost U.S. firms anywhere from $10,000 to $500,000
per visit.
<LI>Distinct possibilities exist that rights of due process could
be violated in relation to warrantless searches and personnel
being compelled to answer questions, and provide information and
access.
<LI>With the advent of foreign inspections, proprietary information
could be compromised hurting U.S. competitiveness.
</UL>
<P>
<P>
&quot;By all accounts the treaty is flawed, and we strongly urge
the U.S. Senate to take a sober look at the CWC.  We believe an
honest assessment of the treaty will reveal that the costs to
U.S. businesses, the loss of our economic freedom and compromising
constitutionally protected American rights do not justify ratification
-- especially with the prevalent belief that the treaty will harm
U.S. national security,&quot; said Kerrigan.<BR>

<b>Washington, D.C.</b> &#173;&#173; The Small Business Survival Foundation
(SBS Foundation) &#173;&#173; a nonpartisan research and education
organization focusing on public policy issues relating to small
business and entrepreneurship &#173;&#173; has called on candidates
to focus closely on the issues in this year's campaign.  To help
this process along, the Foundation re&#173;released its comprehensive
guide to issues impacting entrepreneurs and the economy &#173;&#173;
&quot;Entrepreneurs and Elections '96: A 
Candidate's Handbook to Critical Small Business Issues.&quot;
<P>
SBS Foundation President Karen Kerrigan declared: &quot;Entrepreneurs,
business 
owners, and their employees are looking for a substantive, issues&#173;based
campaign in 1996.  
<P>
&quot;Entrepreneurs and Elections '96&quot; will help candidates
at both the federal and state levels, 
as well as the media and citizens in general, to sort through
the real issues affecting small 
business, entrepreneurship, and the economy.&quot;<BR>
<P>
SBS Foundation Chief Economist Raymond J. Keating, author of &quot;Entrepreneurs
and Elections '96,&quot; echoed these comments by noting, &quot;As
the campaign season moves 
into high gear, the tendency increases for rhetoric to overwhelm
substance.  Our 
&quot;Entrepreneurs and Elections '96&quot; booklet attempts to
keep attention and offer guidance on 
substantive issues.&quot;<BR>
<P>
Each chapter in &quot;Entrepreneurs and Elections '96&quot;deals
with important public 
policies and how they impact entrepreneurs and the economy &#173;&#173;
tax policy, government 
spending, regulations, monetary policy, trade, immigration, health
care, government 
reform, as well as key issues at the state and city levels.  The
booklet also examines the role 
of small business and entrepreneurship in today's economy and
over the next century.    
<P>
Keating concluded: &quot;Our economy has been growing at a slow&#173;to&#173;mediocre
pace 
since the late 1980s and we need to be debating policy options
that will place the economy 
on a high&#173;growth track.  Of course, real economic growth
and job creation are generated 
through investment and entrepreneurship.  &quot;Entrepreneurs
and Elections '96&quot; offers an 
entrepreneur&#173;friendly agenda.&quot;

<b>Washington, D.C.</b> &#173;&#173; To mark the start of
National Small Business Week, the Small Business Survival Foundation
&#173;&#173; a nonpartisan, nonprofit research and education organization
focusing on small business issues &#173;&#173; released a new
report today the &quot;Small Business Survival Index: Ranking
the Environment for Entrepreneurship Across the Nation.&quot;
<BR>

<P>
Raymond J. Keating, chief economist for the Small
Business Survival Foundation 
and author of the report, noted: &quot;The Small
Business Survival Index provides a measure of 
government&#173;related costs affecting the decisions
of investors, entrepreneurs, and businesses &#173;
&#173; the engines of economic growth and job creation.&quot;<p>
 The study combines nine major costs 
(whether rates, ratios, or indexes) levied on small
businesses and entrepreneurs into one 
comparative index number:<BR>

<P>
<B>Top
Personal Income Tax Rate</B>.  State personal income tax rates
impact economic 
decision&#173;making related to working, saving,
investing, and risk taking. 
<P>
<B>Top
Individual Capital Gains Tax Rate</B>.  State capital gains taxes
are direct levies on 
investment and entrepreneurship &#173;&#173; the
sources of growth in the economy.  
<P>
<B>Top
Corporate Income Tax Rate.</B>  State corporate income tax rates
affect a broad range of 
business decisions &#173;&#173; most clearly decisions
relating to investment and location.
<P>
<b>Property
Taxes (per $100 of personal income).</B>
State and local property taxes impact 
decisions as to where businesses and entrepreneurs
choose to locate, as well as decisions 
relating to investments in facilities.
<P>
<B>Sales
Taxes (per $100 of personal income)</B>.  State and local sales
taxes impact the
economic decisions of individuals and families, as
well as various retail businesses.
<P>
<B>Death
Taxes</B>.  Estate taxes amount to nothing more than a government
hostile takeover of 
a business at the time of the owner's death and impact
investment and location decisions.
<P>
<B>Top
Unemployment Tax Rate Paid by Employers on Taxable Wages</B>.
 The unemployment
tax rate on taxable wages affects labor&#173;versus&#173;capital
as well as location decisions.
<P>
<B>Workers'
Compensation Costs (cost index)</B>.  High workers' compensation
rates also 
impact labor&#173;versus&#173;capital and location
decisions.
<P>
<B>Total
Crime Rate</B>.  Just like taxes, a high crime rate acts as a
disincentive to entrepreneurs, 
who naturally seek out environments where life and
property are protected.  <BR>

<P>
Keating acknowledged that other obstacles are placed
in the path of entrepreneurs 
and businesses at the state and local levels, particularly
regulations.  Unfortunately, no 
reliable, comparative measure for state and/or local
regulatory costs is currently available.  
<P>
<B>Under the Small Business Survival Index, the lower
the index number, the lighter the </B>
<B>governmental burdens, and the better the environment
is for risk taking. 
</B>

<P>
Karen Kerrigan, president of the Small Business Survival
Foundation, noted: 
&quot;According to our Index, South Dakota, Wyoming,
Nevada, and Washington rate best for 
entrepreneurs because they don't tax personal income,
capital gains, or corporate income.  
Texas, New Hampshire, Tennessee, Alaska, and Florida
rank very high as well.  
<P>
Unfortunately, places like Minnesota, New Mexico,
Maine, Montana, Vermont, New York 
State, Iowa, Hawaii, California, and Rhode Island
treat job&#173;creating entrepreneurs and 
small business owners rather shabbily.&quot;  <BR>

<P>
Keating added: &quot;The District of Columbia ranks
as most hostile to entrepreneurship 
when compared to the 50 states.  However, if you
add New York City into the mix, it 
offers the worst environment for entrepreneurship
&#173;&#173; by far.  For entrepreneurs, the Big 
Apple is rotten.&quot;  <BR>

<b>Washington, D.C.</b> -- The Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC)
-- a nationwide, nonpartisan small business advocacy organization
-- today released a statement regarding the observance of Small
Business Week.  SBSC President Karen Kerrigan prepared the following
statement:<BR>
<P>
&quot;Every year small businesses and entrepreneurs become more
vital to the growth and dynamism of the U.S. economy.  Small businesses
and entrepreneurs are the risk-takers and chief job producers
of America, and without their activity our economy would stagnate
and ultimately deteriorate.  National Small Business Week commemorates
the sacrifices made by entrepreneurs, and gives politicians the
opportunity to talk about the sacrifices they've made for small
business.<BR>
<P>
The United States truly is the land of opportunity and entrepreneurship.
 Between 1970 and 1991, the number of sole proprietorships increased
from 5.7 million to 15.2 million -- an increase of 167%.  It is
interesting to note that as over 500,000 Americans lost their
jobs due to downsizing in 1994 (according to the U.S. Bureau of
Labor Statistics), new business incorporations skyrocketed to
a record 750,000 in the same year.  Not surprisingly, more Americans
are taking advantage of technological advances and economic trends
to start their own business.  They have no interest in &quot;corporate
responsibility,&quot; but rather creating their own long-term
economic security.<BR>
<P>
It is essential that elected officials recognize the strong economic
forces that will dominate the 21st Century workforce -- trends
that Senator Connie Mack's Joint Economic Committee fittingly
describe as a workforce controlled by diversity, mobility and
entrepreneurship.  Though these trends have been identified by
the 104th Congress -- with scores of proposals offered to take
advantage of our exciting economic future -- the agenda of growth
and entrepreneurship has been vehemently rejected by President
Clinton.<BR>
<P>
President Clinton has been given sufficient opportunity to support
the entrepreneur's agenda, but through the use of his veto pen
and through countless policies passed and presented by his Administration
-- he has decided to support and advance a European model that
mistakenly places the government at the center of the economy.
<BR>
<P>
President Clinton likes to claim that he's tough on crime and
criminals.  What is more evident, however, is that he has gotten
even tougher on innocent small business owners.  In fact, &quot;Three
Strikes You're Out&quot; -- the trendy slogan for various tough-on-crime
proposals --  is now an appropriate label for President Clinton's
small business record.<BR>
<P>
What are those strikes against the Administration?  STRIKE #1:
 The 1993 Clinton tax hike.  Touted as a soak-the-rich scheme,
small businesses took a bath on  the 'I feel your pain' increase.
 According to the IRS, 70% of those impacted by the hike were
small businesses.  A 1994 Small Business Survival Committee survey
of small businesses revealed that 69% of respondents took some
action in response to the Clinton tax hike.  STRIKE #2:  The Clinton
Health Care Plan.  Adorned with its proposed employer mandates
as the primary mechanism to achieve 'universal coverage,' the
plan would have been devastating to our nation's small businesses.
 Mrs. Clinton claimed that she could not be held responsible for
&quot;every undercapitalized entrepreneur in America,&quot; and
no one asked her to be.  Small businesses want to succeed or fail
on their own, but without the government as a &quot;silent partner&quot;
forcing them into collapse.  STRIKE #3:  The minimum wage hike.
 President Clinton used to be against the wage hike as a &quot;New
Democrat,&quot; but that was before the labor unions took over
his election-year agenda.  The Clinton wage hike is another silly
ploy to appease his boisterous left-wing at the expense of small
business owners.<BR>
<P>
Of course, President Clinton has also vetoed many of the important
reforms recommended by his own White House Conference on Small
Business (WHCSB).  The President has opposed practical and moderate
reforms at OSHA and EPA; securing property rights; reforming outdated
labor laws and <U>repealing</U> Davis-Bacon; giving small business
Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs) in health care reform, to name
a few items.  The WHCSB recommended, but the President promptly
<U>vetoed: </U> an increase in small business expensing; capital
gains tax reduction; estate tax reform; tax equity in health care
reform; pension reform; and tort reform -- all important to small
business growth and survival.<BR>
<P>
President Clinton will make every attempt this week to talk about
how friendly he has been to small businesses, and they will be
rightly incensed by his crass election-year rhetoric.  Moving
bureaucrats around agencies like pawns on a chessboard does not
help the entrepreneur's bottom-line.  &quot;Reinventing Government&quot;'
schemes have not lifted the paperwork and regulatory burden on
small businesses.  Conversely, increasing taxes and regulations
only serve to hurt entrepreneurship and economic growth.<BR>
<P>
President Clinton's track record on small business speaks louder
than his words.  Indeed he has embraced an economic model placing
government at the center of the economy.  The opening exists,
therefore, for a certain White House challenger to expose the
President's bias against small businesses and offer an agenda
that properly places the entrepreneur at the economy's center
--  producing a dynamic and exciting economy offering opportunity
for those who seek the path of entrepreneurship.  A Presidential
candidate who advocates this agenda would truly make National
Small Business Week, a week to celebrate.&quot;<BR>

<b>Washington, D.C.</b> - Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC) President
Karen Kerrigan today released the following statement after the
United States House of Representatives increased the starting
wage: <BR>
<P>
&quot;Small businesses are the job creating engines of the United
States - making up nearly two-thirds of American businesses. 
Mandating the wage hike would effectively throw a monkey wrench
in that engine. The wage hike amounts to an unfunded mandate.
 As such, it should not make its way out of Washington.  And without
a doubt, small businesses will shoulder most of the cost of mandate.
To offset the cost of the wage hike, small business owners will
either be forced to reduce current employee hours, forgo hiring
additional workers, or raise the prices of goods and services.
 All of these consequences -- viewed by us as anti-worker -- 
will not put more money in the pockets of minimum wage workers.
The wage hike gives President Clinton a chance to again say 'I
feel your pain' during this election year.  But every time the
President 'feels our pain,' his compassion is followed by another
blow to small businesses and entrepreneurs.  For the small business
sector, this false compassion has meant increased taxes and costs,
courtesy of Bill Clinton.&quot;  <BR>

Small Business Group Applauds 
General Tax Principle & Policies Offered By Kemp Commission
</h2>
<i>January 17, 1996		</i></center>

<B>Contact: Renee Stikes<br>
(202) 785-0238</b>
<HR>
<P>
<b>Washington, DC</b> -- The Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC) voiced its support 
today for the general guiding principles and policies for tax reform outlined by the<A href ="/taxcom"> National 
Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform,</a> or the Kemp Commission.  SBSC is a 
40,000-member small business organization advocating a free-market, pro-entrepreneur policy 
agenda.
<p>
SBSC President Karen Kerrigan observed: "Overhauling our nation's tax code stands as a 
top issue for the small business community.  The Kemp Commission has outlined what we 
believe are the basics of a flat tax that will serve to significantly boost the nation's economy."
<p>
SBSC saw particular merit in several of the Commission's suggestions: to impose just a 
single, low tax rate on income; to end double taxation of businesses and their owners; to permit 
expensing of investment outlays; to exclude the returns on saving from taxation; to require a 
two-thirds majority vote in Congress to raise the tax rate; and most importantly, to abolish the 
capital gains tax.  While the Commission recognized that estate and gift taxes make "little sense," 
SBSC would have liked a much clearer declaration for the elimination of all "death" taxes that 
prove particularly burdensome for family-owned businesses.
<p>
Raymond J. Keating -- chief economist for the SBSC and author of a booklet entitled 
"The Great Tax Debate: Making Sense of Competing Tax Plans" (published by SBS Foundation) 
-- was enthused by the fact that the Commission's principles and policies lined up closely to 
those outlined in "The Great Tax Debate."  A side-by-side comparison is provided below.
<p>
Keating declared: "We're very pleased to see that the Commission recognizes the critical 
role that entrepreneurship plays in the economy -- as the engine of growth and job creation -- and 
the enormous obstacle our current tax code is to investment and risk taking."
<p>
"The Kemp Commission's report is not long on details, however.  Now comes the heavy 
lifting of making detailed, principled tax overhaul a reality," concluded Kerrigan.
<p>
<P>
<P>
<h4>Kemp Commission</h4>

<ul><i>Six Points of Principle:</i>
<p>
<li>Economic growth through incentives to 
work save and invest.
<br>
<li>Fairness to all taxpayers.
<br>
  <li>Simplicity so that anyone can figure it out.
<br>
<li>Neutrality that lets people and not 
government make choices.
<br>
<li>Visibility to let people know the cost of 
government.
<br>
<li>Stability so people can plan for the future.</ul>
<p>
<UL><i>Six Points of Policy:</i>
<p>
<li>A single tax rate.
<br>
<li>A generous personal exemption to remove 
the burden on those least able to pay.
<br>
<li>Lower tax rates for American families.
<br>
<li>Ending biases against work, saving, and 
investment.
<br>
<li>Making the new tax system hard to 
change.
</ul>
<p>
<h4>The Great Tax Debate</h4>
<p>
<ul><i>Eight Principles of Sound Taxation:</i>
<P>
<li>Low Flat Tax to Promote Economic 
Growth -- the lower and more proportional, 
or flatter, the tax rate system the better.

<br>
<li>No Taxation of Capital -- taxing returns on 
investment and savings makes absolutely no 
economic sense.

<br>
<li>Inflation Factor -- the detrimental effects 
of inflation should be factored into any tax 
system's design.

<br>
<li>Clarity -- the clearer the tax system the 
better.  Taxes should be as obvious as 
possible.

<br>
<li>Simplicity -- tax payments should be made 
as easy and as simple as possible without 
any loss of clarity.

<br>
<li>Limited Bureaucracy and Intrusiveness  -- 
the fewer tax collectors and the more limited 
their powers the better.

<br>
<li>Minimize Incentives for Tax Avoidance  -- 
taxes should be low enough so as to not 
provide significant incentives for tax 
avoidance.

<br>
<li>No Additional Boost to Government 
Spending -- a tax system's design should not 
make it any easier for government to 
increase expenditures.
</ul>

<B>Small Business Group Blasts Minimum Wage Hike Proposal</B><P>

<b>Washington, D.C.--</b>  The Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC)
 a 40,000 member small business advocacy group that promotes a
freemarket, proentrepreneur agenda  declared their disgust today
with President Clinton's efforts to further derail current budget
negotiations, and hurt small businesses and lowskilled and young
workers as well, by proposing a minimum wage increase in his latest
budget proposal.
<P>
The President's proposal would raise the current $4.25 rate to
$4.70 on July 1, 1996 and to $5.15 on July 1, 1997.
<P>
SBSC President Karen Kerrigan observed:  &quot;The minimum wage
is not a budget issue and should not be included in budget proposals
and negotiations.  More important, however, is the fact that the
President is offering, once again, a proposal that will hurt small
businesses by raising their costs.  The President seems intent
on not only delaying the completion of the federal government
budget, but on damaging the budgetary well-being of many small
enterprises.&quot;
<P>
Kerrigan added, &quot;It is obvious that the President added the
minimum wage hike -- a critical objective of labor unions -- into
the budget plan.  It represents his big payoff to big labor. 
He desperately needs their reelection support next year.&quot;
<P>
SBSC Chief Economist Raymond J. Keating added:  &quot;Increasing
the minimum wage makes no sense from an economics standpoint as
well.  Indeed, no selfrespecting economist would argue that a
minimum wage hike helps lowskilled, lowincome, young workers.
 In fact, study after study shows that these individuals are hurt
most by a minimum wage increase as their unemployment levels climb.&quot;
<P>
Keating continued, &quot;Work experience is crucial so that individuals
can gain marketable skills, learn the disciplines of the marketplace,
and advance in life.  Increasing the minimum wage denies these
experiences as young and lowskilled worker s are priced out of
the labor market. As government artificially boosts wages with
a minimum wage hike, employers seek out alternatives to hiring
young, lowskilled individuals.  The likelihood of falling prey
to the welfare state then naturally increases.
<P>
While a minimum wage increase might sound compassionate, in reality
it is another cruel blow by government leveled at the disadvantaged.&quot;
<P>
&quot;No one will gain from President Clinton's proposed increase
in the minimum wage,&quot; concludes Keating.  &quot;The budget
process will slow; small business costs will rise; and young and
lowskilled workers will suffer.&quot;

Small Business Group Documents Superfund as Highly Toxic For Entrepreneurs and Business</h2>

<blockquote>
<b>Washington, D.C.--</b>  The Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC)
 a 40,000member small business advocacy group that promotes a
freemarket, proentrepreneur agenda  released a report today highly
critical of the federal government Superfund program.  &quot;Highly
Toxic: The Superfund Assault on Common Sense, Business and Entrepreneurship&quot;
was written by SBSC Chief Economist Raymond J. Keating. 
<P>
U.S. Representative Bill Zeliff (RNH), a leader in Superfund reform
efforts and Chairman of the Small Business Survival Caucus, wrote
the foreword to the report.
<P>
&quot;Highly Toxic&quot; documents some of the history, the massive
costs and egregious inefficiencies of the Superfund program, which
was designed to help clean up hazardous waste sites across the
country.  Instead, according to the report, a mere 18 percent
of the worst waste sites have been cleaned up at a combined government/privatesector
cost of approximately $90 billion.
<P>
Keating declares: &quot;Superfund unleashed the bloated bureaucracy
and gross inefficiencies of the federal government on often unsuspecting
individual and businesses; turned essentially local or, at most,
state problems into national woes; set arbitrary and unattainable
criteria for compliance; sent legal costs skyrocketing; forced
many businesses to close their doors; reduced capital available
for investment in certain industries; restrained job growth; and
damaged U.S. international competitiveness.&quot;  &quot;Highly
Toxic&quot; fully explains and offers examples of each of these
Superfund consequences.
<P>
&quot;Superfund is riddled with problems,&quot; Keating notes,
&quot;but worst of all is its liability scheme.  Under Superfund's
strict, retroactive, and joint and  several liability, if a business
disposed of waste  toxic or nontoxic, large or insignificant amounts
 in good conscience and in complete accordance with the law, it
can still be held liable for the costs of cleaning up the disposal
site if it later became a Superfund site.  Notions of responsibility
and fairness mean absolutely nothing under Superfund.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Highly Toxic&quot; suggests phasing in a threestep reform
process for Superfund: 
<P>
1) repeal retroactive liability for all actions taken before 1987
 eliminating litigation at an estimated 80 percent of Superfund
sites, use sciencebased risk assessment and costbenefit analysis
to determine required clean up remedies, and cap the number of
Superfund sites to gain some control over costs; 
<P>
2) in the name of fairness and common sense, repeal the strict,
retroactive, and joint and several liability schemes altogether,
and only assign liability to individuals and businesses who broke
the law, who were negligent, fraudulent, deceptive, etc.; and

<P>
3) eventually put an end to Superfund  waste sites are local or,
at most, state issues, not federal.
<P>
Keating concludes:  &quot;At the very least, Superfund must be
completely overhauled. 
<P>
As things currently stand, no one wins under the Superfund scenario
of high costs and few clean ups.&quot;

Small Business Advocate Supports Return to Citizen Congress</h2>
<i>November 16, 1995</i>		</center>

<HR>
<P>
<B>Washington, D.C.</B> - The Small Business Survival Committee
(SBSC), a 40,000 member small business advocacy organization,
announced support for an effort to historically change Congress.
 SBSC president Karen Kerrigan voiced support for the Citizen
Congress Act and its sponsors - Representatives Mark Sanford and
Wayne Allard and Senator Bill Frist.
<P>
&quot;The American people are tired of business as usual in Washington,
D.C.  The failure to enact congressional term limits adds to the
importance of implementing a bold initiative such as the Citizen
Congress Act, which we hope will change the face of Washington,&quot;
remarked Kerrigan.
<P>
If enacted, an initiative such as the Citizen Congress Act will
help restore the faith of the American people in their elected
officials.  For too long, voters have been made promises while
important measures such as term limits and a Balanced Budget Amendment
have not materialized.  By eliminating perks and wasteful practices
from within, Congress can begin to reverse the empty rhetoric
of the past several years.
<P>
According to SBSC, Abolishment of the federal pension system,
banning franked mass mailings, no automatic pay increases, and
limited military aircraft travel are significant reforms which
reduce government spending.  At a time when the country's fiscal
condition is instable, there is little reason not to tighten Congress'
belt.
<P>
Because federal lawmakers have failed to implement the wishes
of the public in regards to term limits, the Citizen Congress
Act will remind Members of their responsibility to the public.
 Voters, particularly small business owners, want the Congress
to be more accountable in every regard.
<P>
&quot;The Citizen Congress Act symbolizes a time-honored American
virtue - self-sacrifice.  We encourage all Members of Congress
to support this important initiative,&quot; Kerrigan added.

</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<center><h3>News Release<P>
Reconciliation Bill's Capital Gains Tax Cuts Are Essential
to Entrepreneurship and Small Business Growth, Says Small Business
Advocacy Group</h3>
<i>November 16, 1995</i>		</center>
<P>
<B>Contact: Renee Stikes<br>
(202) 785-0238</b>
<HR>
<P>
<B>Washington, D.C.</B> -- The Small Business Survival Committee
(SBSC), a 40,000-member small business advocacy organization,
today praised the capital gains tax cutting measures recently
announced by the House and Senate budget conferees.
<P>
The tax package will cut capital gains taxes on individuals and
corporations $35.7 billion. This cut would be retroactive to January
1, 1995. Additionally, individuals and corporations would have
reduced capital gains tax rates for investment in qualified small
business stock. Although the package fails to index capital gains
taxes to inflation immediately, SBSC President Karen Kerrigan
stated that the country's weak to moderate growth would receive
a firm boost from the capital gains tax cutting measures.
<P>
&quot;Taxes on capital gains are perhaps the most regressive for
small businesses and entrepreneurs. High capital gains taxes prevent
many entrepreneurs from overcoming their number one obstacle to
start-up and growth -- access to capital,&quot; said Kerrigan.
<P>
Kerrigan, however, added &quot;In no way should Congress fail
to realize the importance of indexing capital gains for inflation.
The lack of indexation creates additional disincentives for investment
-- restraining small business growth and job creation -- we hope
indexation is addressed before 2001.&quot;
<P>
According to SBSC, after factoring for inflation, a nominal profit
on a transaction can turn out to be a real loss, yet the investor
still pays taxes on the nominal gains. These <I>real rates</I>
of capital gains taxation are severe impediments to keeping America's
economy vibrant and growing.
<P>
Kerrigan added that opponents who try to attempt to classify the
issue as one of rich vs. poor do not have a firm grasp of economics
and are ignoring the facts of who benefits from capital gains
reduction. According to 1992 IRS tax returns, 83% of those claiming
capital gains had total incomes of less than $100,000 -- 53% claiming
capital gains had total incomes of less than $50,000.
<P>
Most importantly, a capital gains tax reduction will strongly
benefit America's budding entrepreneurs and small businesses.
SBSC Chief Economist Raymond Keating adds, &quot;an inability
to stand by a cut in capital gains taxes would be a most damaging
blow to entrepreneurship, investment, and the economy.&quot;

Real World Investment Pros Scoff <br>
at Treasury Secretary Rubin's "Train Wreck" Scenario</h2>
<i>November 3, 1995</i>		</center>
<P>
<B>Contact: Renee Stikes<br>

<HR>
<P>
<b>Washington, D.C.</b> -- Several leading investment experts, members of the Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC) -- a 40,000 member nonprofit, nonpartisan advocacy organization -- predict that a failure to pass tax cuts and a balanced budget will do much more harm to financial markets than failing to pay interest and/or principle on U.S. Treasury securities.  In response to Treasury Secretary Rubin's debt limit "crisis," and White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta's remarks that Republicans will cause an earthquake in the financial markets due to the possibility of delay in raising the $4.9 trillion debt ceiling, SBSC experts comment:
<P>
"In our opinion, the financial markets are up strong since last November because they are correctly anticipating less government and lower taxes...If the markets were concerned, particularly the bond market, interest rates would have moved up long before now...Long term, the financial markets care much more about tax policy (by a wide margin) than any other single issue...Lower taxes means lower interest rates, stronger economic growth, and higher stock prices...Now, if Congress fails to pass a significant tax cut, then we would be worried."
<i>Mark J. Deschaine, Investment Counselors Incorporated, St. Louis, Missouri</i>
<BR><P>
"During meetings with clients in Boston last week, several portfolio managers, each investing literally billions of dollars of other people's money, all told me the same thing regarding the budget/tax debate in Washington.  They said they would be incredibly bearish if there is any hint of a "sellout" on real deficit reduction to get a deal and would be much more worried about the future of the markets, stocks and bonds, if that happens than if any so-called train wreck scenario unfolds on a short term basis."
<BR><i>James H. Slagter, The Research Network, Wayne, New Jersey</i>
<P>
"The world's financial markets have made clear their strong disapproval of congressional spending through a clear inverse correlation between Congressional spending (or proposing to spend) and the value of the dollar -- a proxy for the U.S. credit rating.  With each new spending bill, such as the crime bill or the failed Balanced Budget Amendment, the dollar tanks...If Congress truly wants to prevent a "train wreck" they had better pursue this balanced budget proposal -- full steam ahead."
<BR><I>James C. Kennedy, Kennedy Capital Management, Inc., St. Louis, Missouri</i>
<P>
"Worries over a significant backlash in financial markets due to a so-called budget 'train wreck' are grossly overblown.  If some kind of temporary default on federal government securities actually occurred -- though quite doubtful -- the impact on the bond market would likely be small and shortlived.  Indeed, a real threat to U.S. financial markets looms if capital gains tax reduction, including indexation for inflation, were to somehow fall by the wayside.  Since the Republican congressional victories in November 1994, equity markets have been robust, especially small-cap, high-tech stocks.  Markets have been counting on a significant capital gains tax cut; if this fails to materialize then we should be worried."

<b>For Immediate Release:  September 22, 1995<br>

                            <P>
Washington, D.C. </b>-- In a newly released booklet, the Small Business Survival (SBS) Foundation substantiates the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) crushing impact on entrepreneurship and economic growth, driving high-paying jobs and growth industries overseas.
                                     <P>
SBS Foundation -- a nonprofit, nonpartisan research and education organization examining issues crucial to the entrepreneurial sector of  the economy -- has published a booklet entitled FDA Hazards:  How FDA Red Tape Impacts Entrepreneurs and the U.S. Economy.
                                               <P>
SBS Foundation Chief Economist Raymond J. Keating, author of "FDA Hazards," offers numerous examples of where and how the FDA has gone awry.  From orange juice raids to export hurdles to shutting down the last smoked-herring company in the United States, the FDA has moved beyond a traditional role of reasonable safety regulation and education to a harsh, confrontational stance with U.S. entrepreneurs and businesses.
                                                            <P>
And while FDA enforcement tactics have become more aggressive and intrusive, its ability to meet deadlines in terms of medical device and drug approvals deteriorates.  Keating notes that the average FDA approval times in these critical areas fail to even come close to what is required.  As approval times become more lengthy and costly to U.S. firms, FDA's inflation-adjusted budget increased by almost 53 percent between 1989 and 1994, and the number of full-time FDA employees increased by more than 25 percent.
                                                                       <P>
"FDA Hazards" examines the record of the FDA in terms of its ability to move medical devices and drugs through its approval process in a timely manner;  its strategies and tactics when dealing with entrepreneurs and businesses;  its budget and number of employees;  the incentives under which FDA employees operate;  and more.
                                                                                <P>
Several market-based reforms are suggested in "FDA Hazards":
                                                                                         <ul>
<li>The FDA should be scrapped in favor of a smaller agency geared toward safety and education.  The private sector should be tapped for medical device and drug approvals.
                                                                                              <P>
<li>The government has a role in helping to secure consumers against substantial risks they could not know about -- i.e., safety -- as well as fraud.  Determining the efficacy of products, though, should be left to doctors, hospitals, experts, consumer groups, et al.
                                                                                    <P>
<li>The marketplace needs to rest upon sound legal and regulatory systems.  Unfortunately, both systems have gone awry, and some of our most dynamic industries -- medical devices and pharmaceuticals -- suffer accordingly.  Legal reform is needed.
                                                                          <P>
<li>The FDA ban against manufacturers distributing information regarding off-label uses of drugs such as independent journal articles and studies, should be lifted.
                                                                  <P>
<li>A federal agency's enforcement powers, as well as it processes and standards for determining what products fall under its jurisdiction, should be scrutinized and reviewed annually by Congress.
                                                       <P>
<li>The U.S. should negotiate and enter into agreements with other nations to recognize each other's drug and medical device approvals.
              </ul>   <p>
In addition to a total restructuring of the FDA, Keating also advocates the elimination of capital gains taxes, which will help attract capital to such high-risk industries as medical devices and pharmaceutical.
                                    <P>
Keating summarizes the FDA's woes as follows:  "A government agency that delays the approvals of beneficial drugs and medical devices to the degree that the FDA does, ensures that U.S.-based firms function at a severe disadvantage.  Of course, not only does this mean less investment, slower economic growth, and fewer jobs, but it also means that U.S. consumers often are denied access to life-saving devices and treatments."
                                                                                                                 <P>

<h2> DO MEGA CORPORATIONS LIKE WESTINGHOUSE AND DISNEY
                    NEED CORPORATE WELFARE?</h2>
</center>
<p>

<b>  WASHINGTON, DC --</b> Who is more in need of financial help -- the American taxpayer or Mickey Mouse?  The two high-profile buyouts of ABC and CBS this week paint a clear example of how ludicrous it is for Congress to be giving billion dollar handouts to the networks.
<p>
Karen Kerrigan, President of the Small Business Survival Committee last week announced that SBSC has created the Campaign for Broadcast Competition (CBC).  The Campaign opposes legislation now before the House which gives wealthy broadcasters - at no cost - public airwaves valued at $100 billion.
<p>
Kerrigan said, "Corporations like Disney and Westinghouse are paying top dollar for networks, while the networks are looking for a handout from Uncle Sam.  They plead that only government gifts will save them from technical advances.  But, the facts are clear."
<p>
"On August 1st, Westinghouse Electric Company agreed to buy CBS for $5.4 billion.  In 1994 alone, CBS's total revenue amounted to $3.7 billion, and their profit was $426 million. Westinghouse showed a revenue of $8.8 billion with a profit of $619 million."
<p>
"On July 31, 1995 Disney announced its intent to purchase CapCities/ABC for $19 billion.  CapCities reported a profit in 1994 of $638 million, while Disney reported a profit of $1.1 billion."
<p>
"With profits like these, why is Congress giving the networks six new digital channels? As the television industry consolidates, does it really make sense for the U.S. government to enrich these companies further?"
<p>
Kerrigan and the CBC advocate auctioning the air waves, as the FCC did recently for wireless communications.  "Auctioning off the airwaves would foster competition, generate billion in revenues to reduce the deficit, and end an insidious form of corporate welfare," continued Kerrigan.
<p>

<B>Jack Kemp Returns!</B>
<P>
After taking a leave of absence to campaign as Bob Dole's vice-presidential running-mate,  
Empower America co-director Jack Kemp is now back with us.  Stay tuned to this site to see 
what ideas he will be putting on the table in the near future.
<P>
<B>Body Count</B>
<P>
Empower America co-director William J. Bennett has recently released his newest book, Body 
Count, which he co-authored with Professor John DiIulio and John Walters.   The book takes a 
look at the problem of crime in America, especially the prospect of a rising wave in violent 
crimes committed by juveniles.
<P>
<B>Issues</B>
<P>
We are currently improving our web site by creating an archive of various documents produced 
by Empower America.  The archive will be categorized by issue.  Several such issues are already 
up and running.  Click on the issues link in the left margin to see a list of choices.
<P>
<B>New Empower America Study</B>
<P>
On November 7, Empower America held a press conference on Capitol Hill to release a new 
study, In Defense of A Nation, on the contributions of immigrants to the U.S. military.  Look for 
a full text copy of the report to be up on this site soon.  In the meantime, check out what 
Empower America has had to say about immigration in the past.
<P>
<B>Press Conference</B>
<P>
Empower America co-directors Lamar Alexander, William J. Bennett, Jeane Kirkpatrick and Vin 
Weber, and Empower America board member Donald Rumsfeld were all assembled for a press 
conference on November 13th. See excerpts from their remarks on the future of conservatism in 
America.

	ACU: RE-ELECT GINGRICH 
</h3></center>
<a href="/conservative/press/keene010697.html">Statement by David A. Keene</a>
<br><a href="/conservative/press/res010697.html">ACU Board Resolution</a>
<p>

<blockquote>

WASHINGTON, DC.--- "Two major factors have led us to the unprecedented position we announce today on the re-election of Newt Gingrich as Speaker of the House," said David A. Keene, Chairman of the American Conservative Union (ACU). "Regardless of any minor differences we have had with the Speaker in the past, there is no question that under his leadership, the national debate is now being conducted in conservative political terms. From our perspective as the leading grassroots conservative ideological organization, this is vital. To defeat Gingrich is to effectively cede control of the House to the liberals who oppose him. 
<P>
"The second relates to the hypocrisy of Gingrich's liberal Democrat critics. They have transformed the struggle from a routine partisan difference into an ideological battle. They oppose him not just because he is a Republican, but because he has helped reinvigorate the Republican Party and brought conservative initiatives to the forefront of the nation's political agenda. These same liberal leaders have had little or nothing to say about illegal and unethical shenanigans within the Clinton Administration, the Democratic National Committee, and the House Democratic leadership itself."
<P>
ACU's 33-member Board of Directors has endorsed a <a href="/conservative/press/res010697.html">resolution</a> supporting Gingrich's re-election as 
Speaker, observing that "conservative Congressional leadership is required to promote and advance conservative legislative initiatives the American people support in the 105th Congress and beyond" and that Gingrich's critics are attempting to force him from office "for purely partisan political reasons while ignoring extremely serious ethical lapses plaguing the Clinton Administration, the House Democratic leadership, and the Democratic National Committee." It marks the first time that the organization has taken a formal position on a Congressional leadership election.
<P>
"By supporting Newt Gingrich for re-election as Speaker, ACU is not condoning or excusing unethical conduct," Keene said. "If the Speaker has acted contrary to House rules, then he should be held to account just like any other member. What concerns us is that the ethics charges have been exploited by his critics not simply to bring him down personally, but to derail the conservative agenda in Congress. That's why we cannot stand by and watch that happen."  
<P>
ACU, founded in 1964, is the country's oldest grassroots-oriented conservative lobbying organization. On behalf of its nearly one million members and supporters, it lobbies on a wide range of issues before the Congress.<P><center>

<title>Speaker Gingrich Accepting the Speakership of the 105th Congress
</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<center>
<h3>Remarks by Speaker Gingrich</h3>
</center>

<blockquote><blockquote>

<P><br><p>


<P>Let me  say to those who voted for me, from
the bottom of my heart, thank you. To those who voted for someone else,
I hope that I can work with you in such a way that you feel that I am capable
of being speaker of the whole House and representing everyone. </P>

<P>To the freshmen and their families and all the young people who are
here today, you are part of a wonderful experience. Just as in less than
two weeks we will welcome the president for an inaugural, we here in the
legislative branch also celebrate a remarkable moment which the entire
world watches; a time when an entire nation voluntarily decides how to
govern itself and does so in such a manner that there is a sense among
the entire country that freedom is secure and that every citizen can participate.
</P>

<P>This is the 105th time we've done this as a country -- every two years.
The first one actually did not occur until April the 1st, 1789, because
while everyone was supposed to show up in March for the brand new Congress,
they couldn't find a quorum. And then they all came together. And there
are wonderful stories by people who were there written in their diaries
and their letters about the fact that they were just folks from all over,
of many different backgrounds. Back then they would all have been male
and they would all have been white and they would all have been property
holders. </P>

<P>Today we have extended democracy and freedom to levels that the Founding
Fathers could not have imagined. </P>

<P>And any citizen anywhere on the planet watching through C-SPAN and through
the networks and seeing this room and its diversity, can appreciate the
degree to which America opens its doors and its hearts to all people of
all backgrounds to have a better future. </P>

<P>In addition to the elected members, we are very fortunate to have a
professional staff on both sides of the aisle and a professional staff
serving on a nonpartisan basis. And let me say that I think that Robin
Carle stood well as the clerk of the House in representing all of us in
establishing with dignity. </P>

<P>And I thought that in the interchanges between she and Chairman Fazio
that the world could see legitimate partisanship engaged in legitimacy
-- legitimately, exactly the way it should be; in a professional, in a
courteous, in a firm way on both sides. And I think that's part of what
we have to teach the world. </P>

<P>In just a few moments, my dear friend John Dingell, who represents a
tradition in his district, who has fought all these years for all that
he believes in, who in the last Congress served so ably in helping pass
the Telecommunications bill, is going to swear me in. And I am going to
ask -- then I will have a chance to swear you in. But before that, if I
might, I'd say to my dear friend -- let me say my wife is here and my mother
and my relatives. </P>

<P>And two years ago, they were here with my father. He is not here today,
as I think all of you know. He was an infantryman. He served this country.
He believed in honor, duty, country. </P>

<P>Let me say to the entire House that two years ago, when I became the
first Republican speaker in 40 years, to the degree I was too brash, too
self-confident or too pushy, I apologize. To whatever degree, in any way
that I brought controversy or inappropriate attention to the House, I apologize.
</P>

<P>It is my intention to do everything I can to work with every member
of this Congress. And I would just say, as with telecommunication in Congressman
Dingell's case, on welfare reform, on line item veto, on telecommunications
reform, on steps towards a balanced budget, again and again we found a
bipartisan majority willing to pass significant legislation, willing to
work together. </P>

<P>There's much work to be done. I've asked Chairman Henry Hyde of the
Judiciary Committee to look at the issue of judicial activism. He has agreed
to hold hearings looking at that issue. </P>

<P>I think all of us should focus on increasing American jobs through world
sales. And I have asked Chairman Archer to look at the whole issue of taxation
and how it affects American job creation. </P>

<P>I've also asked the Ways and Means Committee to look at oversight on
NAFTA, on the World Trade Organization, because the fact is, we have to
move the legislative branch into the information age. If there are going
to be continuing bodies around the world, then Chairman Gilman in International
Relations and Chairman Archer and others have to get in the habit, I think,
of a kind of aggressive oversight, reporting to the nation on whether or
not our interests are being protected. </P>

<P>I've also asked Chairman Archer to prepare a series of hearings looking
at the entire issue of how we revise the entire tax code; whether we go
towards a flat tax or whether we replace the income tax with a sales tax,
or what we do; but to begin a process that, frankly, may take four to six
years, but is the right direction for the right reason. </P>

<P>Finally, I've asked Chairman Spence, on the National Security Committee,
both to look at the issue of national missile defense and to look at the
question of military reform. </P>

<P>And let me say to all of my friends on both sides of the aisle, we have
every opportunity through reform to shrink the Pentagon to a triangle;
we have every opportunity to apply the lessons of downsizing, the lessons
of the information age. And just because something is in uniform doesn't
mean it has to be saluted, but instead, we should be getting every penny
for our taxpayers, and we in the Congress should be looking at long-term
contracting as one way to dramatically lower the cost of defense. </P>

<P>But I want to talk about one other area. And here I just want to say
there's something more than legislation. Each of us is a leader back home.
And I want to just talk very briefly about three topics, and it's about
these children and their America, children on both sides of the aisle,
children from all backgrounds in every state. </P>

<P>I think we have to ask the question, as leaders, beyond legislation:
How do we continue to create one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty
and justice for all? I believe most Americans, whether native-born or immigrant,
still desire for us to be one nation. So let me briefly talk about three
areas that I think are vital. </P>

<P>Let me say first, I think -- I'm going to talk just for a second about
race, drugs and ignorance. First, let me ask all you: Do we not need to
rethink our whole approach to race? And let me draw the parallel to Dick
Fosbury. He was a high jumper. In the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City, he
developed an entire new approach which is now used by everyone. Yet for
six years, the U.S. Olympic Committee rejected it. </P>

<P>My point is very simple. I don't believe any rational American can be
comfortable with where we are on the issue of race. And I think all of
us ought to take on the challenge as leaders, beyond legislation, beyond
our normal jobs, of asking some new questions in some new ways. After all,
what does race mean when if based on merit alone, ethnic Asians would make
up a clear majority at the University of California at Berkeley? What does
race mean when colleges recruit minorities in the name of inclusiveness
and diversity and then segregate them in their own dormitories? What does
race mean when many Americans cannot fill out their census forms because
they're an amalgam of races? And furthermore, if those of us who are conservative
say that bureaucracy and compulsion is not the answer, then what are we
going to say to a child born in a poor neighborhood with a broken home
and no one to help them rise, who has no organic contact to prosperity
and has no organic contact to a better future? </P>

<P>Now, I mentioned this in passing two years ago, and one of the failures
that I would take some of the responsibility for is that we did not follow
up. But I want to put it right on the table today that every one of us,
as a leader, has an obligation to reach out beyond party and beyond ideology
and, as Americans, to say, ``One of the highest values we're going to spend
the next two years on is openly dealing with the challenge of meaning that
when we say in our declaration that we are endowed by our Creator with
certain unalienable rights, including life, liberty and the pursuit of
happiness, that every child in every neighborhood, of every background,
is endowed by God. </P>

<P>And every time America fails to meet that, we are failing to meet God's
test for the country we should be.'' </P>

<P>Let me say second about drugs; I think we have to redefine and rethink
our approach to drugs. One of my close friends had her 19-year-old sister
overdose, and her 19-year-old sister today is in a coma and celebrated
her 20th birthday in that coma. Drugs aren't statistics. As Charlie Rangel
told me at breakfast just two years ago, drugs are real human beings being
destroyed. Drugs are real violence. If we did not have drugs in this country,
the amount of spouse abuse, the amount of child abuse, the amount of violence
would drop dramatically. And so I want to suggest that we should take seriously
reaching across all barriers and establishing an all-out effort. </P>

<P>You know, the Columbia University Center for Addiction and Substance
Abuse has done a fascinating study. The center found that one of the best
predictors of whether a child will stay free of drugs is whether he or
she practices a religion. Joe Califano, Lyndon Johnson's former adviser
and Jimmy Carter's secretary of Health and Human Services, says that religion
is part of the solution to our drug problems and to drug treatment itself.
Alcoholics Anonymous refers to a ``higher power.'' I don't know what all
the answers are. But I do know that if we love these children, in addition
to fighting racism and reaching out to every child, we need to decide that
we are prepared to have the equivalent of an abolitionist movement against
drugs and to do what it takes so that none of these children end up in
a coma celebrating their birthday or end up dead. </P>

<P>Lastly, we need to pay closer attention to a word you don't hear much
anymore: ignorance. Traditionally, ignorance ranked with pestilence, hunger,
war as abominations upon humanity. But in recent years, the word ignorance
has been cleaned up and refined into some aspect of educational failure.
I mean by ignorance something deeper. It's not about geography in the third
grade. It's about learning the work ethic. It's about learning to be a
citizen. It's about learning to save. It's about all the things that make
us functional. It's about the things that allow virtually everybody in
this room to get up each morning and have a good life. </P>

<P>There are too many place in America where people are born into dysfunction,
educated into dysfunction and live in dysfunction, and we should find a
way to reach out in this modern era and use every tool at our tips, from
computers to television to radio to personal volunteerism, so that every
family that today happens to be dysfunctional has a chance within the next
few years to learn to be functional. </P>

<P>And I think we should take ignorance as as serious a problem as drugs
or race. </P>

<P>We in the Congress have one place; we have an obligation beyond any
other, and that's this city. And I want to commend Eleanor Holmes-Norton
for the leadership she has shown and the courage she has shown day after
day and week after week. She and Tom Davis and Jim Walsh worked their hearts
out over the last two years, and I believe it is fair to say that in some
ways, we have begun to make progress. It is not easy. It has to be done
carefully. It cannot violate the right of the citizens of this city. But
let's be candid, first, this is our national capital. We have a unique
obligation on both sides of the aisle, to care about Washington, because
we are today to Washington what a state government would be back home to
your town. We have an unusual obligation to Washington. </P>

<P>Second, it is our national capital. And people looked at me as though
I'd lost my mind a year and a half ago when I met with Mayor Barry and
I said, ``You know, our vision ought to be the finest capital city in the
world.'' And that ought to be our vision. </P>

<P>And furthermore, if we're going to talk honestly about race and we're
going to talk honestly about drugs and we're going to talk honestly about
ignorance, we owe it to every citizen of this District, every child in
this District, to have a decent chance to grow up and go to a school that
succeeds, in a neighborhood that is drug-free and safe, with an expectation
of getting a job in a community that actually cares about them and provides
a better future. And we should take on as a capital -- as a Congress, our
responsibilities to the District of Columbia, and we should do it proudly.
And we should not be ashamed to go back home and say, ``You're darn right
we're helping our national capital because we want you to visit it with
pride, and we want you to know that you can say to anyone anywhere in the
world: Come to America and visit Washington, it is a great city.'' </P>

<P>Let me close with this final thought -- and I appreciate my friend,
John, standing there. And I apologize for having drawn you forward, particularly
since you're standing on one foot. </P>

<P>But this has been a very difficult time. And to those who agonized and
ended up voting for me, I thank you. Some of this difficulty, frankly,
I brought on myself. We will deal with that in more detail later. And I
apologize to the House and the country for having done so. Some of it is
part of the natural process of partisan competition. </P>

<P>This morning, a very dear friend of mine said that he was going to pray
to God that I would win today, and I asked him not to. I asked him to pray
to God that whatever happens is what God wants, and then we would try to
understand it and learn from it. </P>

<P>Let me put that forward in the same thing for all of us as we approach
the next two years. I was really struck about a month ago when I walked
down to the Lincoln Memorial and I read the Second Inaugural, which is
short enough to be on the wall. And 12 times in that inaugural, Lincoln
refers to God. I went back and read Washington's first inaugural, which
is replete with reference to America existing within God's framework. I
read Jefferson's first inaugural -- since he's often described as a Deist
-- which refers to the importance and the power of Providence. All of you
can visit the Jefferson Memorial where he says -- around the top it is
inscribed --''I have sworn upon the altar of God Almighty eternal hostility
against all forms of tyranny over the minds of men.'' </P>

<P>We have much to be proud of as Americans. </P>

<P>This is a great and a wonderful system. We have much to be ashamed of
as Americans; from drug addition to spouse and child abuse, to children
living in ignorance and poverty surrounded by the greatest, wealthiest
nation in the world; to a political system that clearly has to be overhauled
from the ground up if it is going to be worthy of the respect we want and
cherish. </P>

<P>I would just suggest to all of you that until we learn in a nonsectarian
way -- not Baptist, not Catholic, not Jewish -- in a nonsectarian way --
until we learn to reestablish the authority that we are endowed by our
Creator, that we owe it to our Creator, and that we need to seek divine
guidance in what we are doing, we are not going to solve this country's
problems. In that spirit, with your prayers and help, I will seek to be
worthy of being speaker of the House, and I will seek to work with every
member sent by their constituents to represent them in the United States
Congress. </P>

<h2>Setting an Example</h2> 
<i>Jan. 3, 1997</i>
</center>
<p>
<br>
<p>

I usually refrain from commenting on people before they have been formally charged, but the recent news regarding Michael Irvin has me thinking -- Is there anyone in the public eye left that our children can look up too. 
<P>
It seems that wherever we look, another athlete or movie star has had another run-in with the law. Whether it is Irvin's cocaine problem and the latest rape incident, or the late Snoop Doggy-Dog with his gangster lifestyle, our children are witnessing the demoralization of America first hand.  Each time one of their favorite stars fall, a child must lose a bit of faith in humanity. It must be an incredibly confusing experience for a young child to see the man, who's image is plastered all over their bedroom walls, taken away in handcuffs.
<P>
Even I, as an adult, was affected a few years back, when I heard that Magic Johnson was living a lifestyle that exposed him to HIV.  Events such as these affect more than just the participants - they seem to cheapen our society piece by piece.  It has gotten so bad that most parents wouldn't want their children to grow up to be President.  For our society to be at the point where the office of the Presidency isn't highly respected is a sad commentary on our country.  
<P>
NBA player Charles Barkley, who often gets into trouble on the basketball court, likes to say that he doesn't have to be a role model.  Baloney.  Being a role model is not something one chooses, but being a good role model is.  As long as we inhabit this earth, children will look up to and emulate those they see on television.  Athletes and other celebrities must just accept this responsibility along with the millions that get paid by the parents of these children.
<P>
Some athletes have accepted this responsibility.  Jim Harbaugh, quarterback for the Indianapolis Colts, always starts every interview following a victory with the words "I want to thank my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ."  This is something that my children should be respecting - a man who has succeeded in sports and still understands his priorities.  The opposite, once again is exemplified by our favorite good Samaritan, Michael Irvin.  After winning the Super Bowl, he was on national television swearing and using the f-word with frequency.   I was completely embarrassed to be watching such a disregard for common courtesy.
<P>
Parents already have a difficult task in raising their  children.  They don't need to compete with Michael Irvine and his flamboyant lifestyle. The sad thing is that Irvin and the Cowboys might just win it all again this year.  Wouldn't that be a great lesson to teach our children?


<p>
God bless you in your efforts,<p>

<b><h2><CENTER>PHILLIPS FOUNDATION SEEKS APPLICANTS FOR JOURNALISM FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM</h2>
<h3>Working Journalists Eligible for $50,000</h3><br>
<hr size=3 width=50%></center><p>
</CENTER>
<blockquote>
Potomac, MD, November 12, 1996</b> -- The Phillips Foundation today announced that it is now accepting applications for the 1997 Phillips Foundation Journalism Fellowship Program.  Working journalists with less than five years of professional experience in print journalism are eligible to apply.  The Phillips Foundation offers one full-time $50,000 fellowship and two part-time $25,000 fellowships to undertake and complete a one-year project of the applicant's 
choosing focusing on journalism supportive of American culture and a free society.
<p>
The Phillips Foundation is a non-profit organization founded in 1990 to advance the cause of objective journalism in several ways, including this annual journalism fellowship.  The Foundation established this program to provide grants for projects to be undertaken by working print journalists who share the Foundation's mission to advance constitutional principles, a democratic society and a vibrant free enterprise system.  The Foundation awarded two fellowships in 1996:  a full-time fellowship to Stacy Mattingly for her proposal to write a book on a highly-charged school prayer case in northern Mississippi; and a part-time fellowship to Daniel Richardson to write a series of articles on the growing Patriot movement in America.
<p>
The three Trustees of the Phillips Foundation serve as judges for this annual competition.  The Trustees include:  Thomas L. Phillips, President and Chief Executive Officer of Phillips Publishing International, Inc.; Robert D. Novak, prominent national journalist and author of one of the longest running syndicated columns in the country; and Alfred S. Regnery, a Washington attorney and President of Regnery Publishing, Inc., a Washington, D.C.-based book publishing firm.
<p>
The Foundation is looking for journalism projects which are both original and publishable.  The winning projects will be delivered in four installments with the potential to be published sequentially in a periodical or all together as a book.<p>

Applications are now being accepted for the 1997 Phillips Foundation Journalism Fellowship.  Applications must be postmarked by March 1, 1997. The winner will be announced on May 6, 1997 at an awards dinner in Washington, D.C.  The starting date for the fellowship will be September 1, 1997.  Applicants must be citizens of the United States.
<p>
For an application, contact:  The Phillips Foundation, 7811 Montrose Road
Potomac, MD  20854, Attention: John Farley.  Phone:  301-340-2100.

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva"><B>Freedom.</B> That's the important conclusion of the <i>1997 Index of Economic Freedom</i>, published jointly by <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a>, the prominent Washington, D.C., think tank, and <a href="http://wsj.com"><i>The Wall Street Journal</i></a>, the international financial daily.
<p>
The <i>Index</i> proves that the path to prosperity has the same starting point worldwide: economic freedom. The higher a country <A HREF="/heritage/index/rankings.html">ranks</A> on the <i>1997 Index of Economic Freedom</i>, the faster it is likely to grow, improving the living standards of its people. The more a government interferes in the free market, the slower the economy and the poorer the citizens.
<p>
In addition to lively essays by Heritage analysts and editors from the <i>Wall Street Journal's</i> Editorial Page, the Index provides country-by-country analyses of the world's economies. With up-to-date data on 150 countries, it's a practical, readable reference on tax rates, tariffs, banking, foreign investment codes, regulations, and more. 
<p>
The  <i>1997 Index of Economic Freedom</i> is an indispensable handbook for anyone who invests or does business abroad. And it's an essential guide to growth for those who want to understand why some countries prosper and others lag behind.

<b>This was originally posted to the Town Hall Forum (#3474)</b>
<P>

    TO: MY DEMOCRAT FRIENDS <P>
    FROM: MARK F. (THOR) HEARNE, II<P>
    DATE: OCTOBER 11, 1996<P>
    RE: THE CASE FOR CHARACTER<P>
<P>
<blockquote>
"Bill Clinton would rather climb a tree to tell a lie than stand on the ground to tell the truth." So said an Arkansas official familiar with Clinton on CNN during the 1992 presidential campaign. Democratic Senator Bob Kerry has said, "Clinton is an unusually good liar. Unusually good. Do you realize that?" Senator Kerry did not make this observation during the heat of a primary battle but this past January in Esquire Magazine. Kerry is not only a Democratic Senator, but is also a leader of his party and Chairman of the Democrat Senatorial Campaign Committee. Senator Kerry knows whereof he speaks. 
<P>
Forget what this says about Clinton - what does it say about us. We are told that Clinton is leading by a significant margin in his campaign to be our next president. (51% to Dole's 38% according to last week's Wall Street Journal/ABC poll.) We are told that "character" does not count. We are told that a candidate's "personal life" has no relevance to the office of President and has no "traction" as a political issue. Indeed, we are even made to feel ashamed for raising the issue. (On July 15th Clinton said, "I think character is a legitimate issue and I look forward to having that discussion." But, whenever the issue of character is mentioned Clinton dodges the discussion by claiming any question about his character is a viscous, Republican-motivated "personal attack.") 
<P>
    Consider the current best seller list. A list which includes an astounding number of books about the
    corruption of the Clinton administration. Boy Clinton, Unlimited Access and Blood Sport are
    only a few. But let's concede Clinton the benefit of his denials and explanations. Taking only those facts Clinton has acknowledged, and even
    granting him his spin on these facts, Clinton is far and away the most dishonest president or presidential candidate in the history of our nation. 
<P>
    Let us assume that only 10% of what is reported about Bill Clinton is true. Assume that only 10% of the reports of drug use, rampant promiscuity, financial fraud,  and blatant violations of state and federal law are accurate. Assume only 10% of the Wall Street Journal's four year, two volume documentation of Whitewater, Travelgate and FBI Filegate is not innuendo and conjecture. Assume that Clinton's unlikely explanation of Whitewater is correct. (It wasn't a crooked deal to funnel taxpayer guaranteed funds from a Savings and Loan into his political campaign. Rather, we are told, Bill and Hillary, naive in matters of money -- notwithstanding Hillary's wildly successful commodities speculation -- were duped by the crafty McDougalls into a foolish real estate investment scheme funded by kited checks and illegal loans. Frankly, even if valid, I fail to find any comfort in this explanation. Do we want a sharp crook or a financially unsophisticated waif in charge of our national economy?) 
<P>
    Granted even these assumptions, impeachment should be likely, reelection unthinkable. Consider the following: 
<P>
        Richard Nixon's administration collapsed, Nixon resigned the presidency and Chuck Colson
        was jailed over misuse of only one FBI file and the related cover-up. By contrast, Clinton and
        Craig Livingstone spirited away the FBI files of their political opponents by the hundreds,  and the
        cover-up and stone-walling continues. 
<P>
        Spiro Agnew resigned the Vice-Presidency over charges of tax evasion stemming from
        $16,000 he accepted from contractors when he was Governor of Maryland. By contrast,
        Clinton has conceded that he filed misleading tax returns that did not properly disclose illegal
        loans made by a now-defunct S&L,  the proceeds of which were used in his campaign for
        Governor. The reason he was not charged with tax evasion was that he released the tax returns
        after the statute of limitations had expired. Equally well established is the fact that Hillary
        enjoyed more than $100,000 in "profits" from commodities trading orchestrated
        by Tyson Foods in exchange for favorable treatment accorded Tyson Foods by her husband, 
        then the Governor. 
<P>
        Gary Hart bowed out of the 1988 presidential race because of one wild weekend in the
        Bahamas and a sleep-over in Washington DC. By contrast, Clinton is being sued in federal
        court for enticing a young woman - against her wishes -- into his hotel room, dropping his
        trousers and suggesting she engage in a lurid sex act. Clinton's known sex-partners could form
        a single-file line longer than the inaugural parade route. (At least JFK was honest about his
        philandering. During a 1961 meeting in Bermuda with British Prime Minister Harold McMillian
        Kennedy said, "I wonder how it is with you, Harold? If I don't have a woman for three days, I get terrible headaches.") 
<P>
        Ginsburg is not a member of the US Supreme Court because he used marijuana during
        college. By contrast, during Clinton's term national drug use has doubled due to Clinton's
        eviscerating drug enforcement. Remember also Jocelyn Elders, Clinton's selection for Surgeon
        General. In addition to her crusade to distribute condoms (for which she earned the moniker
        "the Rubber Maid") and to have mast. taught in public schools, she campaigned for the
        legalization of drugs. During her term as Clinton's Surgeon General, Elders son was convicted
        of felony cocaine and crack distribution. (If she couldn't keep her own son from pushing
        crack, how could she be expected to reduce national drug use?) It is simply beyond belief
        that, with someone of Elder's views as his pick for the nation's chief medical officer, Clinton
        expects us to believe he truly wants to battle illegal drugs. 
<P>
        On a personal level Clinton acknowledges that he used marijuana but claims he "didn't inhale".
        Yet in an MTV interview with high school students Clinton states that if he had it do over again
        he, "probably should have inhaled." Roger Clinton described his brother's appetite for cocaine
        by stating, "He (Bill Clinton) has a nose like a Hoover." (Referring to the vacuum cleaner not
        the president who preceded Roosevelt.) But, we can discount this allegation because Roger
        Clinton, along with Friend Of Bill Dan Lasater, have been convicted of felony drug charges for
        the distribution of cocaine. 
<P>
    (As an entry for the "How'd They Do That" file consider this: Roger Clinton served only two years
    for his cocaine distribution charges and Dan Lasater served only six months. Roger cut a deal with
    the prosecutor to testify against Lasater. Lasater was convicted but pardoned by Governor Clinton.
    (Clinton says the pardon was so Lasater could qualify for a hunting license.) However, even as
    Lasater was being investigated for drug dealing Clinton's Arkansas Finance Authority awarded
    Lasater authority to underwrite a $30 million bond issue. An undertaking for which Lasater pocketed
    $750,000. The purpose of this bond issue for which the state of Arkansas awarded $750,000 to a
    drug dealer? An Arkansas state police communication facility. Clinton's pardon of Lasater raises an
    interesting point. Why won't Clinton promise to not pardon Susan McDougal (who is currently in jail
    because she refuses to testify about Clnton's role in the Whitewater scandal) and other Whitewater
    defendants? Clinton has already indicated a willingness to put the power of a presidential pardon to a
    personal purpose. Clinton has pardoned Jack Pakis a Hot Springs, Arkansas bookie and close friend
    of the Clinton family. 
<P>
    Given this, why is Clinton the favored candidate for president? Have our standards for the office of
    president fallen this far this fast? What does it say about us and our esteem for our nation that we
    would trust Bill Clinton with the United State of America. 
<P>
    A question should be asked of each vice-presidential candidate in the upcoming debate. "Would you
    want your daughter to marry a man with the personal character of your running mate?" Recall the
    question to Mike Dukakis about how he would view the death penalty if his wife Kitty was raped.
    Well, why not a similar question to Hillary. How would she feel if Chelsea brought home a boyfriend
    with the same character and integrity as Bill Clinton? (Some may be upset with me for bringing Hillary
    into the discussion. After all, they may retort, she is not running for office. Would it have been fair
    they ask to deny Lincoln the presidency because Mary Todd was a lunatic? To which I reply, Yes, if
    Lincoln had threatened to put Mary Todd in charge of the Union Army as Clinton tried to do with
    Hillary and health care.) 
<P>
    Two responses, and only two responses, are possible. One, all the charges against Clinton are false
    and Clinton is, in truth, a noble and honest - though much maligned - man. (This is the official White
    House position.) Two, the charges are, in whole or part, true but it just doesn't matter. Clinton's
    character is irrelevant to his fitness to serve as president. 
<P>
    If you opt for option number one, "Clinton is a wrongly- maligned honest man", than you probably
    also thought O.J. Simpson was framed. Haley Barber's line, "Clinton may not believe anything, but his
    friends have convictions - for bank fraud, embezzlement, conspiracy..." resonates because it is true. 
<P>
    Two-thirds of the Rose law firm, the source of Clinton's closest colleagues including his wife, are either dead under suspicious circumstances (Vince Foster), in jail after serving in the Clinton
    administration (Webster Hubble) or under indictment or investigation by a special prosecutor
    (William Kennedy). A similar fate has befallen many of Clinton's other top advisors. Housing
    Secretary Henry Cisneros and Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy are currently subject to an independent counsel
    investigation; former Commerce Secretary Ron Brown was a subject of an independent counsel
    investigation prior to his death; Clinton understudy and friend Arkansas Governor Guy Tucker and
    Clinton business partners Jim and Susan McDougal have been jailed for 24 count conviction for bank fraud and
    conspiracy. Clinton testified on behalf of the McDougals and Governor Tucker. After the trial, jurors
    told reporters that they did not believe Clinton's testimony and several jurors stated that, based upon
    the evidence they considered, Clinton was definitely involved in the wrongdoing. 
<P>
    It is simply not possible to consider the incredible number of Friends Of Bill who are under
    indictment, under investigation by independent counsel, in jail or awaiting sentencing and conclude
    that all the charges against Clinton are false. 
<P>
    Clinton apologists reply that it is unfair to paint Clinton with the same brush as his jailed colleagues.
    Democrat Senator Chris Dodd claims that to view Clinton in light of his friends is to engage in "guilt
    by association". These defenders argue that Clinton has just suffered the misfortune of being
    surrounded by dishonest people and is not, himself, dishonest. This explanation, even if credible, is of
    little comfort. Do we want as president a man so lacking in judgment that he has a profoundly
    uncanny ability to choose as his closest advisors a collection of crooks and felons. 
<P>
    Bluntly put, Bill Clinton is an unmitigated, dissembling liar. What Clinton says is meant to deceive not
    to inform. During an interview on September 23rd with PBS's Jim Lehrer Clinton said, "There is not
    a single solitary shred of evidence of anything dishonest that I have done in my public life." Most of us
    hearing this proclamation would understand it to be a blanket denial of any wrongdoing. Clinton
    clearly intended to communicate this understanding. However, reread Clinton's statement. "There is
    not a single solitary shred of evidence...." Clinton does not deny dishonestly, rather he denies that
    there is any evidence of his dishonesty. Quite a different proposition. Continuing with a further
    qualification Clinton said, "...that I have done in my public life." The injection of "public life" presumes
    a distinction with Clinton's private life. Given the mountainous evidence of Clinton's dishonestly, we
    can only conclude that Clinton believes using drugs, funding his Arkansas gubernatorial campaigns,
    funding his presidential campaign, managing the White House travel office and FBI files and
    formulating national policy are all part of his private life. 
<P>
    Option Two, "Clinton is dishonest but character doesn't count when choosing the President", is
    equally untenable. Consider the purpose of the election. For starters, this November we will decide
    who will take the constitutionally prescribed oath next January. A candidate for president does not
    become president by winning the election. The candidate must also take the oath of office and does
    not become president until he does so. (Recall the photograph of Lyndon Johnson taking the oath of
    office in Air Force One on the tarmac in Dallas standing next to a blood- splattered Jackie
    Kennedy.) 
<P>
    We do not make much of oaths now days. Yet, the men who crafted our form of government,
    founded our nation and authored the Constitution placed great significance on oaths and,
    correspondingly, the integrity of the individual taking the oath. A man's honesty and integrity were
    vitally important to our founding fathers. Thomas Jefferson, founder of the Democrat party, wrote,
    "We mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor." Of what value is
    Bill Clinton's "sacred honor" and to what cause would he pledge it? (Obviously not his wife, nor his
    country when called to military service.) More importantly, would you believe him if he did? 
<P>
    This is a more troubling question for my principled liberal friends. (Especially for those who make so
    much of Republican scandals whether it be Watergate, Iran- Contra or the Teapot Dome.) The most
    outrageous Republican is a piker compared to the mythomaniacs, miscreants and poltroons which
    populate the Clinton administration. (Will someone please tell me George Stephanopoulos's job
    description and how whatever it is he does furthers the legitimate business of the presidency.) 
<P>
    Those Democrats who support Clinton (and their allies in the media who overlook the Clinton
    scandals) have lost the right to ever again mention Watergate, Iran-Contra or any other allegation of
    Republican corruption. 
<P>
    Most liberals acknowledge Clinton's fundamental dishonesty. However, they appear willing to
    tolerate or overlook his moral failings because they believe Clinton will advance a liberal ideology and
    Bob Dole will oppose the liberal's agenda. But, in choosing Clinton as their standard bearer, what are
    liberals saying about their own integrity and the validity of their ideology? 
<P>
    How can the noble ideals proffered by the liberal be reconciled with the tawdry and untrustworthy
    reputation of their candidate? What does is say about the validity of liberalism that the adherents
    chosen advocate is a consummate fraud? In choosing Clinton as their candidate (a candidate who
    liberals support because they believe he will govern with a liberal bent even though he publicly
    campaigns as a conservative) aren't liberals saying that their agenda is best advanced by disguising
    and concealing their ideology and, by implication, recognizing that if American voters truly
    appreciated the liberal agenda they will reject the ideology? 
<P>
    If I believed I had a worthy policy to advance I would not choose an unworthy spokesman to
    advance the policy lest the message be sullied by the messenger. If I was trying to sell a drug to cure
    cancer I wouldn't choose Jack Kevorkian to be my spokesman. 
<P>
    Indeed, Clinton's failure to keep the faith even with political bed-mates is why two high-ranking
    administration officials resigned when Clinton signed the Republican welfare reform bill that
    he had previously promised to veto. Abandoning Clinton is the only rational response available
    to honest liberals who truly believe in the merits of their ideology. 
<P>
        Others don't defend Clinton but disparage us.  They argue:
<P>
    "So what if Clinton lies, uses drugs and cheats on his spouse, most American's behave this way and it
    is hypocritical to hold a leader to a standard higher than the standard by which we measure our own
    behavior." 
<P>
    While I don't agree that Clinton's behavior is characteristic of the typical American, I will grant this
    point for the sake of argument. Granted even that assertion, I dispute the central premise. Americans
    aspire to greatness and have always been an optimistic people. Our leaders should be the best from
    among us not the worst. 
<P>
     The political results of a second Clinton term are certainly to be feared.  However, an even sadder result of a Clinton reelection would be that a majority of
    Americans would seem to believe that a man of Clinton's integrity is representative of the character of our nation. 
<P>
    It has been said that hypocrisy is vice's tribute to virtue. Well, if so, Clinton should be Master of
    Ceremonies for a Telethon for Virtue. Within hours of being elected president Clinton proclaimed
    that his administration would be the most ethical ever. This promise was made in the context of
    Clinton's campaign attacks upon the Bush administration that it claimed was unethical. 
    Clinton called attention to a State Department official who allegedly tried to pull Clinton's visa file to document Clinton's trip to the Soviet Union; a trip that was made while Clinton was leading anti-American rallies overseas. Clinton was "shocked" at the Bush campaign's "outrageous" use of official personnel and records to gain an advantage on a political adversary. Ironically,  Clinton can not understand why everyone seems so outraged by the hundreds of FBI files on Republican opponents that he and Craig
    Livingston had squirreled away in the White House. 
<P>
    What does it mean when the victor of this fall's campaign will take the oath of office to lead our
    nation into the next millennium? For me I want to believe the man who places his hand on the Bible
    and says, "I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United
    States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United
    States." 
<P>
    November 5th is national examination day. The question is one of character. Not Clinton's character
    but our character; our character as a nation and as individual voters. And, if the answer is Bill
    Clinton, we all fail. 
<P>

<h2>The Estate Tax: Not Worth All the Trouble</h2><BR>
by Raymond J. Keating<br>
Chief Economist
<P>
Small Business Survival Foundation<BR>
</center>
<P>
<P>
Benjamin Franklin pointed out that &quot;in this world nothing
is certain but death and taxes.&quot;  However, dying and taxing
used to be two separate events &#173;&#173; both generally faced
with trepidation.  Leave it to government to bring these two anxious
moments together in one levy &#173;&#173; the estate tax.
<P>
Of course, the estate tax inflicts great harm on family businesses.
 This government hostile takeover &#173;&#173; estate tax rates
range from 18 percent to 55 percent, reaching 60 percent for some
estates &#173;&#173; at the time of an owner's death can be too
much to overcome.  Indeed, as pointed out last year by Investor's
Business Daily (April 12, 1995), 60 percent of family businesses
fail to survive to the second generation, and 90 percent do not
make it to the third.  The estate tax acts as a leading cause
of family business deaths.  In addition, this enormous tax on
business assets offers little incentive for an owner to continue
investing in and expanding his business as he grows older.  
<P>
To say the least, the estate tax acts as a burden on the economy.
 However, the so&#173;called pay&#173;off for the government is
nominal at best.  As noted in the accompanying chart, real revenues
from federal death taxes have not grown much since 1975.  In fact,
1995 estate and gift tax revenues were actually less than their
1977 level.  On a per capita basis, inflation&#173;adjusted estate
tax revenues were down by one&#173;third between 1977 and 1995.
 In addition, estate tax revenues amounted to just over 1 percent
of total federal revenues in 1995.  Factor in compliance and litigation
efforts relating to the estate tax, and the federal government's
take drops much further (some estimate that as much as 75 percent
of estate taxes are eaten up by such costs).  Add in lost businesses,
jobs, and output, and the estate tax becomes a net loser in terms
of federal revenues.
<P>
When weighing the federal government's net revenues from the estate
tax against the considerable economic damage wrought by this levy,
 the case for eliminating the estate tax becomes crystal clear.

<h2>The Estate Tax: Another Case of Envy Run Amok</h2><BR>
by Raymond J. Keating
<br>
Chief Economist
Small Business Survival Foundation<BR>
</center>
<hr>
<P>
<P>
Envy always makes for dismal economics and bad tax policy.  We've
made this point time and again at the Small Business Survival
Foundation (for example, see &quot;The Great Tax Debate: Making
Sense of Competing Tax Plans by Raymond J. Keating, June 1995).
 Unfortunately, most of today's U.S. tax system can only be justified
on the basis of envy &#173;&#173; sound economics plays no part
at all.
<P>
The income tax, for example, diminishes incentives for working,
saving, investing, and risk taking, while at the same time, is
inefficient and intrusive.  The current U.S. income tax came into
existence in 1913.  It may have seemed fairly innocuous at first.
 Rates ranged from 1 percent to 7 percent, with the lowest rate
not taking effect until a married couple's income hit $60,000
(in inflation&#173;adjusted 1995 dollars, that is) and the top
rate not kicking in until income topped $7.4 million (again, in
1995 dollars).  In subsequent years, as we all know, income tax
rates skyrocketed, reaching ever deeper into the pockets of all
working Americans, not just the wealthy.  And for the most part,
government squandered these resources.
<P>
Following quickly on the heals of the income tax was the estate
tax, imposed in 1916.  This was another envy&#173;driven levy.
 When first imposed, the estate tax was targeted at the rich,
with rates ranging from 1 percent to 10 percent.  Today, the estate
tax takes hold at a lower threshold, with far more severe tax
rates, ranging from 18 percent to 55 percent (even 60 percent
for certain estates).  That is, since the estate tax's inception,
the lowest rate has jumped by 1,700 percent and the top rate by
more than 205 percent.  In addition, the highest tax rate would
have taken hold at an estate valued at almost $70 million under
the original estate tax structure, versus today's, with the top
rate kicking in at just over $3 million.
<P>
Efforts to cut the estate tax are worthy.  However, since no sound
economics basis exists for such a tax, and since the estate tax
serves as a major destroyer of family businesses and jobs, the
most productive step would be to eliminate the estate tax.  
<P>
Envy must give way to economics in order for entrepreneurship
and the economy to flourish.<BR>

<h2>Capital Gains Taxation and Venture Capital</h2><BR>
by Raymond J. Keating<br>
Chief Economist
<p>Small Business Survival Foundation<BR>
</center>
<hr>
<P>
<P>
   Venture capital epitomizes the great spirit of entrepreneurial
capitalism.  Visionary individuals place their resources at great
risk by investing in new ideas, inventions, and innovations &#173;&#173;
by investing in entrepreneurs.  In their own right, venture capitalists
are entrepreneurs themselves.  By making capital available to
promising enterprises, they help to create dynamic change and
growth in the economy.
<P>
   In addition to the many market&#173;based obstacles and risks
confronted by such investors, the government piles on its own
costs.  At the top of the government's destructive actions rests
the capital gains tax.  Capital gains taxation impedes risk taking
by venture capitalists by cutting into potential returns.  The
vast risks associated with venture capital investments need to
be offset by opportunities for substantial returns.  Today's lofty,
non&#173;indexed capital gains tax clearly restrains venture capital
investing, and therefore, entrepreneurship and economic growth.
 
<P>
   As noted in the accompanying chart, real capital commitments
to private venture capital funds were rising robustly prior to
a sharp increase in the capital gains tax in 1987.  The Tax Reform
Act of 1986 possessed one key flaw &#173;&#173; the capital gains
tax was increased by 40 percent, from 20 percent to 28 percent.
 In addition, since capital gains are not indexed for inflation,
the real capital gains tax rate turns out to be much higher than
this oft&#173;stated nominal rate of 28 percent. 
<P>
   Prior to the 1987 capital gains tax hike, real venture capital
commitments rose at a 29.4 percent average annual rate from 1981
to 1986.  Afterwards, the real annual rate of increase averaged
6.5 percent.  A lower capital gains tax rate would have meant
greater venture capital investment.  Indeed, if the average real
rate of increase in venture funds during the early 1980s had been
maintained, 1995 commitments might have topped $40 billion &#173;&#173;
ten times the actual 1995 level.
<P>
   Any serious effort to shift economic growth into high gear
means boosting private sector incentives for investing and risk
taking in order to get capital in the hands of entrepreneurs.
 That, in turn, means eliminating the capital gains tax.<BR>

<h2>Capital Gains and Entrepreneurship</h2><BR>
by Raymond J. Keating<br>
Chief Economist - Small Business Survival Foundation<br>
</center>
<hr>
<P>
<P>
Entrepreneurs are the driving force behind economic growth.  Therefore,
one of the most damaging levies government can impose on individuals
and the economy is the capital gains tax &#173;&#173; a direct
tax on risk taking.  After being reduced in the late 1970s and
early 1980s, the capital gains tax rate was increased by 40 percent
&#173;&#173; from 20 percent to 28 percent &#173;&#173; under
the 1986 Tax Reform Act.  
<P>
The accompanying chart shows one measure of entrepreneurial activity
 &#173;&#173; new business incorporations from 1967 to 1995. 
Since the 1986 capital gains tax hike, new business incorporations
have been quite lackluster.  The break between a powerful rise
in new business incorporations prior to 1987 and thereafter is
striking.
<P>
Lagging entrepreneurship means a lagging economy.  Along with
the Bush and Clinton tax hikes and mounting regulatory costs,
high capital gains taxes explain much of our recent sluggish economic
growth.  Annual real economic growth has averaged just 2.3 percent
since the 1986 capital gains tax hike, particularly slowing after
1989 as the relative dearth in entrepreneurship took hold.  The
Clinton Administration estimates that this anemic 2.3 percent
annual real growth rate will continue into the foreseeable future,
grossly under&#173;performing the post&#173;Civil War annual real
average rate of 3.5 percent.  
<P>
If the capital gains tax had not been increased, incentives for
investing and risk taking would not have diminished, more capital
would have been available for investment, and chances improved
for entrepreneurial activity to increase at a healthy clip.  In
fact, if new business incorporations had managed to continue at
the average annual rate of increase from the previous two decades,
we would have seen almost 2.5 million more new business incorporations
over the period 1987 to 1995.  From 1968 to 1986, new business
incorporations rose at a 6.8 percent annual rate versus a meager
1.1 percent from 1987 to 1995.  In 1995 alone, new business incorporations
would have been almost 470,000 higher than they actually were.
 These higher levels of entrepreneurship would have meant more
products, innovations, efficiencies, economic growth, and jobs.
<P>
A deep cut in the capital gains tax and indexing for inflation
would surely boost incentives for risk taking and spur economic
growth.<BR>

<h2>The Dole Economic Plan and the Entrepreneur</h2>
by Raymond J. Keating<br>
Chief Economist<br>
Small Business Survival Committee<br>
</center>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<dd>With the announcement of the Dole economic plan, tax cuts are back on the front burner of the nation's public policy debate.  And though one can find all sorts of opinions on whether this is a good or bad thing, from the perspective of small business, entrepreneurship, and economic growth, the major proposals put forth in the Dole plan make for sound economic policy.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Cutting the capital gains tax.  The Dole plan calls for a 50 percent cut in the top capital gains tax rate on individuals from 28 percent to 14 percent.  
<p>
<dd>Barring a complete tax overhaul, there is no tax cut that will do more to spur entrepreneurship, investment, economic growth, and job creation than a sharp reduction in the capital gains tax rate.  The great hurdle to starting up and/or expanding a business remains access to capital.  Investing and entrepreneurship are high-risk endeavors.  High risks require the opportunity for substantial returns.  Slash the capital gains tax in half and you enhance the potential returns from risk-taking.
<p>
<dd>A 50 percent reduction in the capital gains tax rate would provide a major boost to small business, entrepreneurship, and the economy.
<p>
<li> Across-the-board cut in personal income taxes.  A 15 percent across-the-board cut in personal income tax rates works favorably for small business and the economy in three key ways:
<p>
<ol>
<li> Boosts incentives for individuals to work, save, invest, and take risks.  Again, this is a straightforward relative price argument -- as the old saying goes, the less you tax something, the more of it you get.
<p>
<li> Resources are shifted from the unproductive sphere of government to the productive private sector.  Or another way to put it, individuals operating in the private marketplace spend and invest their money far more efficiently and wisely than do government bureaucrats.
<p>
<li> Since about 79 percent of all business tax returns are either sole proprietorships or partnerships (the other 21 percent being corporations), then an across-the-board personal income tax cut directly impacts the bottom line of millions of U.S. businesses.  Lower taxes mean more funds available for capital investment, additional employees, et al. 
</ol>
<p>
<li> Additional measures.  The Dole plan calls for other tax cuts and reforms impacting small businesses and entrepreneurs, including: 
<p>
<ul>
<li> Unrestricted tax-free medical savings accounts (MSAs) and 100 percent deductibility for health insurance for the self-employed.  MSAs inject choice and accountability into the health-care system, and 100 percent deductibility places all businesses on an equal plain in terms of the tax treatment of health care expenses.
<p>
<li> Estate tax reductions.  The estate tax amount to nothing more than a government hostile takeover of family businesses.  All cuts in the estate tax are welcome, hopefully on the path to complete repeal of the estate tax.
<p>
<li> Repeal of the 1993 tax increase on Social Security beneficiaries.  Again, this will boost incentives to work and keep resources in the private sector.
<li> Expanded IRAs and institution of spousal IRAs.  Such measures will boost incentives to save and expand loanable funds available to business.
<p>
<li> Regulatory reform.  Requiring peer-reviewed, science-based risk assessment and cost benefit analysis for new regulations, regulatory review of all new regulations every four years, and a task force to review and recommend sunsetting ineffective and costly regulations, all point toward gaining some much-needed control over a federal regulatory apparatus strangling businesses, investment, and entrepreneurship.
<p>
<li>Legal reform.  Measures such as limiting punitive damages in most cases, abolishing joint and several liability for non-economic damages in civil cases, and curbing contingency fee abuses, all amount to a good start at alleviating many of the burdensome costs of our legal system that damage or destroy countless businesses and the jobs they create.
</ul>
<p>
</ul>
<dd>U.S. businesses and entrepreneurs need tax cuts, regulatory relief, and legal reform.  The cost of government is massive, inhibiting new business formation, economic growth, and job creation.  Once fully implemented, the proposals in the Dole economic plan would: 
<ul>
<li> Increase incentives for working, saving, investing, and entrepreneurship.
<p>
<li> Boost rates of economic growth and job creation.
<p>
<li> Help both equity and bond markets, as incentives for investment are enhanced and faster economic growth eases inflation threats (assuming sound monetary policy).  After all, inflation results from too much money chasing too few goods -- faster growth means more goods and services.
</ul>
<p>
<dd>The bottom line is: Tax cuts help small businesses and entrepreneurs.

<h3>Improving the Flat Tax</h3> <P>
<b>by Raymond J. Keating<br> 
Chief Economist<br>
Small Business Survival Committee</b></center><P>	
<hr>
<P>
It is encouraging to see that significant proposals for overhauling the U.S. tax system are actually under serious consideration today, not only in the many think tanks that sprinkle Washington, D.C.'s urban landscape, but in the halls of Congress and on the presidential campaign trail.  In a couple of years, our federal tax code may shed thousands of pages and actually make sense to all Americans.  Indeed, the income tax as we now know it may no longer exist.	Tax Principles.  In a recent Small Business Survival Foundation booklet, "The Great Tax Debate: Making Sense of Competing Tax Plans," our current tax system and a variety of proposed substitutes were analyzed and scored.  Each system was evaluated according to a set of principles for sound taxation: <P>
<ul>
<LI> maintain a low, flat tax rate to limit economic distortions and promote growth; <LI> cease taxing returns on capital, particularly capital gains, in order to eliminate double taxation and spur entrepreneurship and investment -- the economy's lifeblood; 
<LI> create no tax-based 
incentives for government to inflate the currency; 
<LI> clarity -- taxes and who pays them should be obvious; <LI> paying taxes should be as simple as possible for the taxpayer; 
<LI> the tax-gathering bureaucracy should be limited in both size and powers; 
<LI> incentives for tax avoidance should be minimized; 
<LI> and finally, a tax system 
should not make it any easier for government to increase expenditures.	
</ul><P>
<b>Flat Tax and Retail Sales Tax Score Best</b><P>
  According to these criteria, the flat tax and national retail sales tax score best, followed at quite a distance by the value-added tax, the consumed-income tax, and our current mess of a tax code.  Of the top two proposals, the flat tax carries the most significant political support at this time.<P>
<b>Armey Plan</b><P>
  As currently proposed by U.S. House of Representatives Majority Leader Dick Armey, a flat tax would impose a 17 percent rate on both personal and business income.  For individuals, capital gains, dividends, and interest income would not be taxed, having already been captured at the business level.  Personal allowances could be deducted at $21,400 for a couple, and $5,000 for each dependent.  Therefore, a family of four would not pay any tax on earnings up to $31,400.	For business, the 17 percent tax rate would apply to gross revenues minus purchases of goods and services, capital equipment, structures, land, and wages paid to employees.  Deductions would not be allowed for fringe benefits, interest paid, or payments to owners.	Such a plan would simplify greatly how individuals and businesses pay taxes.  <P>Reducing the top tax rate to 17 percent boosts incentives for work and risk taking.  An absence of taxation on individual capital gains, dividend, and interest income, and expensing of capital goods by business, will spur entrepreneurship and investment. <P>
 	A great threat to the beauty and efficiency of the flat tax remains politicians' incessant desire to serve special interests by tinkering with the tax code -- creating loopholes and raising rates.   The current Armey plan would counter such tendencies by requiring a three-fifths super-majority congressional vote in order to raise taxes.  <P>
<b>	Three Steps to a Better Flat Tax</b><P>
  As good as this plan is, however, room for improvement on the flat tax exists.  Three steps would place the flat tax on firmer economic ground -- in greater compliance with the aforementioned principles of sound taxation -- though albeit on more radical political terrain.  However, aren't Republicans telling us we are in the midst of a political revolution?  	<P>
First, the original Armey flat tax plan called for the end of individual income tax withholding, which had begun as a wartime measure during World War II.  <P>

Ending withholding would drive home the true cost of government to the taxpayer.  Instead of having taxes withdrawn before receiving one's paycheck, taxpayers would receive their full pay and then have to write out a check to the federal government for income taxes  on a monthly or quarterly basis.  Individuals would gain a much clearer picture of how much government costs.  In its most recent manifestation, though, the Armey plan no longer proposes an end to withholding.  This much-needed reform should be reinstated.	<P>

Second, tax reformers should stop worshiping the idol of "revenue neutrality."  A desire for revenue-neutral tax reform already forced Rep. Armey to reduce his proposed personal allowances and deductions.  Taxpayers and the U.S. economy need both a sound tax system and lower taxes.  Setting a goal of revenue neutrality means that one tacitly accepts that current levels of government spending and taxation are just right, a dubious proposition to say the least.<P>

In 1995, the federal government will spend $1.54 trillion.  Rather than accepting as inevitable a relentless climb to $2 trillion -- as both Democrats and Republicans seemingly have done -- the goal should be to reduce spending -- descending to the $1 trillion mark.  <P>

Room for downsizing government is substantial and the need for tax reduction paramount.  	<P>
Third, it remains in dispute as to who bears the ultimate burden when it comes to paying business income taxes -- owners, employees, consumers, or some combination of these individuals?  No matter how the burden shakes out, business income taxes remain hidden from the view of those who pay them.  Clarity dictates that taxing income at the business level should be terminated, with dividends taxed, if at all, at the individual level.	Smaller Government and a Flat Tax.  Tax overhaul needs to be part of a comprehensive effort to ease governmental burdens.  Government spending has to be cut substantially.  Income at the business level, capital gains, and interest earned should not be taxed at all.  And the tax rate on all remaining income -- wages, salaries, and dividends -- needs to be as low as possible.  Throughout history, until the early-to-mid twentieth century, a levy of 10 percent was always considered a heavy tax.  A ten percent flat tax on wages, salaries and dividends, with no deductions, would still allow the federal government to collect more than $300 billion in income taxes, conservatively estimated, not to mention revenues from the social security payroll tax.	What would result from this even more revolutionary version of the flat tax?  <P>Entrepreneurship, investment, economic growth, and job creation would be driven to heights that in recent high-tax-rate decades were considered unimaginable.<P><P><center>[ <a href="/sbsc/home.html>SBSC Home</a> | <a href="/sbsc/i-tax.html">Tax Watch Index</a> ]</center></body></html>

<h3>Who Will Be Tax Reform's "Braveheart"?</h3> 
<b>by Raymond J. Keating<br> 
Chief Economist<br>
Small Business Survival Committee</b></center>	
<hr>
<P>
The need to overhaul our tax code has long been apparent, but the necessary political courage was always in short supply.  However, a historic transformation may be under way in Congress as tax overhaul now receives serious consideration.  	As portrayed in Mel Gibson's movie "Braveheart," William Wallace laid the groundwork for Robert the Bruce to gain Scotland's independence from England in the late 13th and early 14th centuries.  One might say that House Majority Leader Dick Armey and House Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer are vying for the role of William Wallace on the matter of tax reform, hoping that their own Robert the Bruce will be elected president in 1996 leading to independence from the many burdens of our current income tax structure.
<p><b>	Can an Income Tax Be Benign?</b>
<P>  As constituted today, the federal income tax system is a mess.  It is punitive, complicated, inefficient, intrusive, and serves as an impediment to entrepreneurship, investment, economic growth, and job creation.  Interestingly however, when initially imposed, the federal income tax appeared rather straightforward and not all that burdensome -- almost benign.  Of course, appearances can be deceiving.
<p>
<b>Original Personal Income Tax</b>  
<P>
As originally proposed, the income tax was meant to impose a very low level of tax rates on only the very highest levels of income.  The 16th amendment to the U.S. Constitution allowing for an income tax eventually won approval because proponents argued that it was a way to force the so-called "robber barons" to pay taxes.  The income tax was not supposed to be a mechanism for reaching into the pockets of most Americans.
<p>
	Figures 1 and 2 illustrate this point quite clearly.  <a href="#1">Figure 1</a> shows the personal income tax structure as initially imposed in 1913, while <a href="#2">Figure 2</a> illustrates what this tax system would look like in 1994 dollars.
<p>
	Undoubtedly, the income tax was not meant to be paid by most citizens, nor were rates so high as to significantly undermine the spirit of enterprise.  For example, if the original income tax system had been left in effect and indexed for inflation, today single taxpayers would pay no tax on any earnings up to almost $45,000 and married couples on earnings up to almost $60,000.  A 1 percent tax rate would be in effect on incomes up to about $300,000.  The top rate of 7 percent would not take hold until earnings of almost $7.5 million.
<p>
<b>Original Corporate Income Tax</b>
<P>
  As for the corporate income 
tax, it was imposed in 1909 at a rate of 1 percent and a $5,000 exemption.  Again, translated into 1994 dollars, corporate income would face the 1 percent rate with an exemption of $81,967.
<p>
<b>Envy = Bad Economics</b>
<P>
  The income tax was an attempt to finance the expansion of government through an appeal to envy.  Envy, though, tends to know no boundaries, and never makes for good economic policy.  The income tax was transformed rather quickly from a light tax on very high incomes to a heavy tax on almost all levels of income.  Naturally, tax avoidance among upper-income individuals -- the ultimate targets of the income tax -- increased along with rising tax rates.
<p>
	As the U.S. undertakes a historic debate over its tax system in the coming months and years, it must be remembered at all times that the income tax remains a dangerous levy.  It raises the costs of working, saving, investing, and risk taking, thereby restraining economic growth.  
<p>
<b>A Boost to Government Spending</b>
<P>
  The income tax also acts as high-octane fuel for the growth of government spending.  Under the income-tax regime, between 1913 and 1994, inflation-adjusted federal government expenditures increased by 13,592 percent!  Over this same period, personal and corporate income taxes grew from 7 percent of total federal revenues and 0.1 percent of the economy, to more than 54 percent of total federal revenues and over 10 percent of U.S. GDP.	
<P>
<b>No Income Tax Led to High Growth</b>
<P>
  As the nineteenth century came to a close and the twentieth century dawned, the United States government imposed no income taxes on its citizens.  It was a period when America took great strides in becoming the world's most powerful economy.  Entrepreneurs pushed the economy to astounding rates of economic growth.  In fact, from 1870 to 1913 -- from when it was agreed that the Civil War income tax would end until the income tax was re-imposed -- the U.S. economy expanded by over 435 percent in real terms, or by an average rate of more than 10 percent per year -- with no inflation.	
<P>
<b>Reforms for the 21st Century</b>
<P>
  As the twentieth century comes to a close and we look toward the twenty-first century, many are concerned with America's economic vitality in an increasingly competitive world economy.  Surely, we must considerably downsize government, deregulate our economy, and re-link the dollar to gold to ensure greater price stability.
<p>
	Perhaps most important, though, we should replace our current tax system with a low, flat tax -- bringing us closer to the original intent of the income tax.  To some degree, this is Representative Armey's suggestion -- his bid, if you will, to be the William Wallace of tax reform.  In contrast, some say simply put an end to one of the twentieth century's biggest impediments to entrepreneurship and growth - the income tax -- and replace it with a direct consumption tax, such as a national retail sales tax.  This is Representative Archer's claim to being a Wallace-like tax reformer.	As long as rates are kept low, the resulting entrepreneurial boom from either plan will stagger even the most wild-eyed optimists and launch the U.S. economy into the twenty-first century.  Of course, as to who will play the role of Robert the Bruce, and actually implement a massive tax revolution, remains to be determined in November 1996.
<p>
<b>Guarding Against Losing Tax Independence</b>
<P>
  One needs to remember, though, that after William Wallace and Robert the Bruce, Scotland eventually lost its independence.  Tax reformers face a similar, ominous threat to their long-run success.  Specifically, flat tax proponents must guard against future presidents and members of Congress merely raising tax rates after most all deductions have been eliminated.  The only way to guard against such backsliding is to require a super-majority vote of the Congress in order to raise taxes.  
<p>
	Retail-sales-tax advocates, of course, must ensure that an 
income tax is not re-imposed at some point down the road.  They must repeal the 16th amendment to the U.S. Constitution allowing for an income tax.	
<p>
Today, the flat tax holds the upper hand politically, and is well worth fighting to implement.  A flat tax rate of 17 percent (preferably even lower), with no taxation of capital gains, interest earned, and dividends, would boost significantly crucial incentives to work, save, invest, and take risks.  	
<p>
In the long run, however, given the destructive nature and history of the income tax, economic freedom and independence for entrepreneurs and all citizens may only be guaranteed by eliminating the income tax, to be "replaced" by government spending cuts and a low retail sales levy of less than 10 percent.  Such a "dream" tax code, though, is not yet in the cards.  Today's revolution is not quite that revolutionary.

<html><head><title>TAX Watch:  Stay Bullish - Cut & Index the Capital Gains Tax</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<center><i>September 1995</i><hr>
<h3>Stay Bullish - Cut & Index the Capital Gains Tax</h3> 
<b>by Raymond J. Keating<br> 
Chief Economist<br>
Small Business Survival Committee</b></center>	
<hr>
<P>
Since the Republicans seized control of Congress in the November 1994 elections, stock prices have been positively buoyant.  Indeed, between November 4, 1994 -- the Friday before election day -- to September 20, 1995, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose from 3807.52 to 4792.69 -- up over 25 percent.  The broader S&P 500 Index climbed from 462.28 to 586.77 -- up almost 27 percent.  The Nasdaq Composite  jumped from 766.08 to 1065.09 -- up almost 39 percent.	
<p>
One may be tempted to call this a Republican bull market.  In fact, that may be the case.  However, it is not party affiliation that matters, but the policies being pursued by those in elected (e.g., Congress and the President) and appointed (e.g., the Federal Reserve) offices.  The Republicans rode into Congress last November promising deregulation, smaller government, elimination of the budget deficit, and tax cuts.  While this combined package has no doubt influenced stock prices, maximum impact springs from the proposal to cut the capital gains tax rate from 28 percent to 19.8 percent and index capital gains for inflation.  It's basic Adam Smith economics -- higher potential profits attract investors.	
<p>
<b>Can't Afford Any Backsliding on Capital Gains.</b>  
<p>
Some faltering in the new Congress' "revolutionary" agenda can be detected.  Instead of eliminating four cabinet level departments as originally envisioned, a massive struggle is underway to eliminate just the Commerce Department.  Funding for the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and PBS lingers.  Indeed, overall federal government spending will continue to rise.  Much-needed reform of how the federal government regulates the private sector is stalled.  Repeal of the blatantly racist and costly Davis-Bacon Act is in serious doubt.  Such shortcomings will take a toll on the economy as well as on Republican political capital.  However, an inability to cut and index the capital gains tax would be the most damaging blow to entrepreneurship, investment and the economy.	
<p>
As the old saying goes, if you want less of something, tax it.  Investors have been counting on a lower, indexed capital gains tax since late last year.  This anticipation explains a good portion of the rise in stock prices during this period.  Failure to deliver on such a pro-entrepreneur tax cut would amount to a sharp blow to capital markets.  In particular, start-up and high-growth, high-tech enterprises would feel the most pain.  In the event of a failure to cut and index the capital gains tax, potential returns on such high-risk endeavors would be reduced and, therefore, so would equity prices.  The amount of capital available for investment would be far less under a higher, non-indexed capital gains tax rate -- indeed, by various estimates, trillions of dollars less.	
<p>
<b>Main Street vs. Wall Street?</b>  
<p>
Of course, opponents paint capital gains tax reduction as a rich-vs.-poor issue, or even as "Wall Street" vs. "Main Street."  Such a confrontation is mythical.  When the successful Main Street entrepreneur with a good idea needs capital to expand and create more jobs, he seeks out investors.  To do so, he often goes to Wall Street.  A lower, indexed capital gains tax -- that is, a higher potential return on capital -- makes it far easier to attract investors.	
<p>
What hurts Wall Street, hurts Main Street, and vice versa.  And of course, what helps one also helps the other.  The best way for federal officials to help would be the complete elimination of capital gains taxes.  Short of such a sound economic policy initiative, reducing the top capital gains tax rate to 19.8 percent and indexing for inflation will do quite nicely for now.	
<p>
<b>Again, the Importance of Retroactive Indexing.</b>  
<p>
As for indexing, its importance cannot be stressed enough.  This has been noted in previous SBSC publications.  The Senate is wavering on indexation.  The House has called only for prospective indexing (calculated from January 1, 1995) on assets held for at least three years.  To make sure that the real capital gains tax rate does not rise above 19.8 percent, that trillions of dollars are unlocked for new investment, and that resources find their way to their best uses, retroactive indexing must be passed and the three-year time limit for indexation eliminated.  	
<p>
The most pro-growth, pro-entrepreneur step this Congress could possibly muster this year is real, significant capital gains tax relief.  It also happens to be a good avenue for keeping a bull market chugging along.

<h3>First Step Toward Budget Sanity:<br> Eliminate the Commerce Department</h3> 
<b>by Raymond J. Keating<br> 
Chief Economist<br>
Small Business Survival Committee</b></center>	
<hr>
<P>

In fiscal year 1995, the U.S. federal government will spend an 
estimated $1.52 trillion.  By the year 2000, President Clinton's budget would see total outlays reach $1.91 trillion.  Even the more frugal House of Representatives Concurrent Resolution on the Budget -- Fiscal Year 1996 calls for spending to rise to $1.78 trillion by 2000.
<p>
This seemingly relentless march toward a $2-trillion federal budget 
needs to be halted.  The United States should be moving in the opposite direction -- downsizing the public sector and freeing up resources for productive, private-sector ventures.  A public-sector retreat -- making room for substantial tax cuts -- will allow the private sector and entrepreneurship to advance.  Real spending reduction means reversing course toward a $1-trillion federal government.
<p>
  Despite the cries from big-government and special-interest circles, much can be cut from the U.S. federal budget.  The Department of Energy, Department of Education, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Department of Transportation, the Small Business Administration, bloated welfare programs, and so many other areas of federal largess offer fertile ground for savings opportunities through considerable downsizing or outright elimination.  As the first major step, perhaps no other department deserves to be dismantled more than the U.S. Department of Commerce.
<p>
<b>The Grand Delusion</b>
<P>
Supporters of the Commerce Department, most prominently Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, claim that the department serves taxpayers and the economy well by increasing U.S. exports, seeding new technologies, and boosting economic growth.  Secretary Brown recently declared: "The work of this department is essential to the economic growth and well-being of this country."1  The Secretary even asserted at the White House Conference on Small Business on June 13, 1995 that the Commerce Department leveraged a "$250 million export promotion budget into $25 billion in overseas sales."  He also declared that an end to the Department's Manufacturing Extension Project would leave "America's 380,000 small manufacturers, with nearly twelve million employees, without accessible and supportive local extension programs providing up-to-date strategies and technologies."  
<P>
Such declarations are, to say the least, most difficult to believe.  After all, if America's small manufacturers relied on a government program for "up-to-date strategies and technologies" and exporters depended on Commerce bureaucrats to sell their wares, our economy today would be a third-world basketcase.  Brown and other Commerce Department proponents fall prey to the grand delusion of industrial policy.  
<P>
In reality, government does not possess the proper knowledge and incentives to be picking industry winners and losers; nor should taxpayer dollars be placed at risk in such futile endeavors.  As for expanding U.S. exports, a productive role for the government is limited to lowering trade barriers.  The Commerce Department should not be acting as the international marketing department for certain American businesses, with taxpayers, including other businesses, footing the bill.  And in terms of boosting economic growth, the economy would be far better served if taxes were cut -- boosting incentives to work, invest, and take risks -- and the Commerce Department terminated.  In the end, individuals buying, selling, creating, and investing in the marketplace always work better than government bureaucrats pushing paper and spending taxpayer dollars.
<P>
In addition to its bankrupt industrial-policy mission, the Commerce Department also serves as a "catch all" federal department.  It houses large governmental undertakings that have absolutely nothing to do with "commerce," such as the Bureau of the Census and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 
<P>
<b>Commerce Budget</b>  
<P>
The taxpayers' price tag for the Commerce Department is by no means cheap.  Federal outlays for the Commerce Department in 1995 are estimated at $3.6 billion.  Figure 1 shows Commerce Department outlays since 1980 and Clinton Administration estimates for 1995 through 2000.
<P>
<b>Dismantling the Commerce Department</b>  
<P>
The U.S. Department of Commerce 
offers a clear opportunity to save taxpayer dollars.  The Commerce Department should be closed, with most of its duties terminated or privatized, and the remaining moved to other departments.  
<ul>
<li> The Bureau of the Census and all other economic and statistical analysis functions at the Commerce Department, at the very least, should be moved into an independent statistical agency, along with other statistical and data-collection functions undertaken by the federal government.  
<p>
However, Jim Miller, former budget director under President Ronald Reagan, offers an intriguing alternative for the Bureau of the Census.  He notes that while the Constitution requires a population census every 10 years, it does not say a government agency has to perform it.  Why not contract it out to a private firm?2  
<p>
<li> All economic development, travel and tourism, and technology programs should be privatized if possible, or otherwise terminated, including the Economic Development Administration, the Minority Business Development Agency, the U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration,  Technology Administration, the National Technical Information Service, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the National Telecommunications and Information Agency.
<p>
<li> End the federal government's roles as international marketing department for multinational firms, and a center for raising protectionist trade barriers against foreign goods.  The International Trade Administration should be closed.
<p>
<li> Legitimate trade activities -- such as negotiating, implementing, and enforcing free-trade accords -- should be moved to the Treasury Department.  The Bureau of Export Administration, though, with its responsibility for overseeing the export of goods that could impact national security, should be moved to the Department of Defense.
<p>
<li> The Patent and Trademark Office should be shifted to the Justice Department.
<p>
<li> As for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), much of this $2-billion behemoth should be privatized, with remaining duties shifted to other departments.  For example, the largest part of the NOAA's budget goes toward the National Weather Service.  Heritage Foundation economist Joe Cobb reports that roughly 300 private companies prepare and disseminate weather forecasts, with 85 percent of the American public receiving its weather forecasts from private meteorologists and for-profit companies.  The opportunity for substantial privatization is at hand.
</ul><P>
<p>
<b>A Revolution Needs Real Commitment.</b>  
<p>
The Republican Congress is sending out mixed signals on the Commerce Department.  Some only want to cut the Commerce budget, but leave the department in tact.  Others want to replace the Commerce Department with another, smaller cabinet-level agency, such as a Department of International Trade.  These half-measures should be abandoned.  
<p>
If our federal elected officials are serious about downsizing government, then the Commerce Department truly must be eliminated.  An inability to make the easy cuts -- like eliminating Commerce -- would bode ill for the more politically difficult, but clearly necessary cuts down the road.  House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Majority Leader Dick Armey issued a statement on July 26 declaring their "firm commitment to incorporate the [Commerce Department] dismantling legislation into the reconciliation bill."3  
<p>
This commitment to eliminate Commerce needs to be unequivocal if we are ever to bring some sanity back to the U.S. federal budget.  Otherwise, failure to kill the Department of Commerce would signal severe weakness and perhaps the end of a shortlived revolution.  <P><hr>

<h3>Clinton's Budding Trade War or Pacific Rim Free Trade?</h3> 
<b>by Raymond J. Keating<br> 
Chief Economist<br>
Small Business Survival Committee</b></center>	
<hr>
<P>
"The consumer is king."  This concept underlies the free enterprise system. While entrepreneurs drive the economy with their new ideas, innovations, products and services, they ultimately must submit their wares to the tests of the marketplace.  The entrepreneur must meet current consumer demands, create new demands, or fail trying.   	<p>
Of course, the consumer reaps enormous benefits.  Competition among producers lowers prices, expands choices, and enhances quality.  International suppliers of goods and services are a major factor in this process, providing greater competition.  This fact probably never has been so clearly illustrated than in the automobile industry.  In essence, the U.S. automobile industry was saved by foreign competition.  As cost and quality suffered in the 1970s and early 1980s, American consumers could look elsewhere for their transportation needs -- foreign automobile companies.  Naturally, U.S. consumers would have reaped even greater rewards had the government not imposed various trade barriers.  However, even somewhat limited competition forced American automobile producers to improve their products -- to meet the needs of the consumer.	Unfortunately, President Bill Clinton and U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Cantor seem ready to overthrow the  consumer as king, replacing him with managed-trade bureaucrats.  The looming threat of 100 percent tariffs on Japanese luxury car imports makes no economic sense.	<p>

Most absurd, the Clinton Administration wants the Japanese government to essentially guarantee market share for U.S. auto parts firms.  Imagine the fury in this nation, if the Japanese pressured the U.S. government to force private businesses to buy a certain amount of Japanese products.  To complete this strange scenario, the proposed 100 percent tariff on 13 Japanese luxury cars would be retroactive to May 20.  Retroactive taxes seem to be a favorite of this Administration -- the 1993 income tax hike was retroactive as well.<p>

A Tax Increase With All the Accompanying Evils.  One needs to remember that a tariff is a tax.  Consumers of Japanese luxury automobiles will face a 100 percent tax on their purchases, if President Clinton carries through with his tariff threat.  The end result of such an act would be to eliminate such vehicles from the U.S. marketplace -- limiting competition and consumer choices.	<p>

The Administration once again is playing the class warfare card, as it did with its 1993 tax increase.  After all, some people say so what if some wealthy individuals will have to either pay a exorbitant tax or consider purchasing a non-Japanese luxury car.  Of course, we all have heard such faulty reasoning before -- such as with the 1990 federal budget deal, which included a luxury tax on yachts.  Of course, the rich were not soaked, but the businesses and the employees who built the boats were devastated.  If the Clinton tax increase on Japanese luxury cars goes into effect on June 28, the hardest impact will be felt by U.S. importers, car dealers, and their employees.	<p>

Indeed, tens of thousands of jobs would be placed in jeopardy.  As 
reported by The Washington Times, 8,000 Americans work in Lexus dealerships and 10,000 in Acura dealerships.  In addition to Lexus and Acura models, Mitsubishi, Mazda, and Infiniti models would fall prey to Clinton's tariffs.  If implemented, these tariffs would be a clear instance where higher taxes closed businesses and placed individuals on the unemployment lines.  The Japanese import car industry asserts that as many as 81,000 jobs would be placed at risk.	An even wider threat looms for the U.S. economy, i.e., Japanese retaliation against U.S. exports.  Japan is the United States' second largest trading partner.  As we all supposedly learned from the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, protectionism hurts everyone in the end.<p>

<b>A Matter of Opening or Serving the Japanese Market?</b><P>
  While most Americans assume that the Japanese market is shut as tight as a clam -- especially in the area of automobiles -- this issue actually remains open to question.  For example, the U.S. may have a point regarding restrictions pertaining to access to Japanese car dealerships.  However, U.S. automakers have never been aggressive in establishing their own dealer networks in Japan.<P>

	More important is the question of supplying autos the Japanese want to drive.  As noted earlier, in order to succeed, a business must meet current or create new consumer demands.  U.S. critics of Japanese trade policies often resort to market share arguments.  That is, since U.S. automakers have captured such small market share in Japan (about 1.6 percent of the new-car market and 1.4 percent of the auto-parts market, according to Investor's Business Daily, June 16, 1995), severe trade barriers must exist.  However, other forces are clearly at work.

<P>For example, the Japanese drive on the left side of the road, 
as a result Japanese consumers are partial (obviously) to right-hand-drive vehicles.  The Economist reported in its June 17, 1995 issue that only two American car models -- in a total of three versions -- come with right-hand drive in Japan.  Meanwhile, the number of models of left-hand-drive Japanese cars in America equals 68, available in a total of 179 different versions.  One easily could conclude that U.S. automakers need to work much harder to meet the demands of Japanese consumers.<p>

<b>"Drop Your Gun, or I'll Shoot!"</b><P>

  Even if we assume that trade barriers remain the largest obstacle to U.S. autos and auto parts in Japan, why punish U.S. consumers?  Whenever a politician threatens to impose retaliatory tariffs on imports, I am reminded of those movie scenes where a character grabs an innocent bystander during a gunfight, puts a gun to that person's head, and yells to his opponent, "Drop your gun, or I'll shoot!"	 <p>

During trade wars, the innocent bystanders with economic guns pointed at their heads are consumers.  Just because the Japanese government may be treating their consumers rather shabbily is no excuse for the U.S. government to treat its consumers the same way.  The U.S. already imposes myriad tariffs and quotas that cost consumers billions of dollars annually.  Indeed, the U.S. is not exactly friendly to many Japanese auto imports, imposing quotas and a 25-percent tariff on imported trucks.  Rather than increasing such penalties, the U.S. should be lowering barriers to trade.<P>

<b>Free Trade on the Pacific Rim</b><P>
  Trade seemed to be the one area of the economy where President Clinton showed some leadership and economic understanding.  Though not perfect, NAFTA and GATT were major steps in the right direction.  Rather than issuing threats, raising trade barriers, circumventing the World Trade Organization (which Clinton helped establish to settle trade disputes), and perhaps creeping toward a full-scale trade war, President Clinton should reassert his leadership on the world scene as an advocate of free trade, and push for a Pacific Rim free trade agreement.  	<P>

The President certainly has struggled on the foreign policy front, including such hotbeds as Somalia, Bosnia and Chechnya.  Not to mention that after pushing for NAFTA, his administration helped to devastate Mexico's economy by assisting the Mexican government with its wrongheaded peso devaluation and bungled policies thereafter.  The President may believe that there are political points to be scored by taking on Japan.  <P>

However, any benefits will be shortlived since his actions are so transparent.  Indeed, The New York Times observed on its editorial page (May 18, 1995) in reference to the President's threatened tariffs on Japanese luxury cars: "It seems designed more to mend the President's relations with American unions than to resolve trade differences with Japan."  <P>

Reasserting U.S. commitment to free trade -- by example rather than by threats -- would bolster the U.S. internationally.<P>

	A free trade initiative for the Pacific Rim would change the course of American-Japanese trade negotiations -- moving away from the threat of a trade war and toward a freer, growing international marketplace.  The President has mentioned support for such an initiative in the past, but now seems to be going off in a far different, economically dangerous direction.  For the sake of the economy, he needs to get back on the free-trade track, and a Pacific Rim initiative makes particular sense at this time.  	<P>

Unfortunately, if Clinton fails to move in this direction, there are 
few signals emanating from Republicans in Congress to indicate that they understand the issue much better.  Indeed, Republicans have been eerily silent in regards to the President's threats against Japan and, effectively, against U.S. consumers.  Indeed, some Republicans have voiced support.<P>

<b>Free Trade: Providing Opportunities for America's Entrepreneurs</b>
<P>
  A recent article in Investor's Business Daily noted that the Japanese were coming to the United States to study entrepreneurship.  A Pacific Rim free trade agreement would grant them first-hand experience.  Tearing down trade barriers around the Pacific would create enormous opportunities for American business and entrepreneurs; consumers would reap great rewards; and economic growth would receive a hearty boost.<P>

	U.S. consumers, as well as businesses and employees working in the U.S. import industry, should not be sacrificed to misguided, politically driven trade policies.  Free trade works best, and the U.S. should reclaim global leadership on this issue.

<title>Capital Gains and the U.S. Senate</title>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
May 1995<p>
 
<center>
<h2>Capital Gains and the U.S. Senate</h2>
by Raymond J. Keating 
Chief Economist 
Small Business Survival Committee
</center><p>
<hr>
 
<i>"Upward mobility is what America is all about, and the ability to access and accumulate capital -- an ability undermined by the capital gainst tax -- is the stairway by which people move up."</i><p>
<p>
--Jack Kemp, The Washington Time, 5/2/95<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>"Experience indicates that lower capital gains taxes have a positive impace on federal revenues.  The most 
impressive evidence involves the period from 1978 to 1985.  During those years the marginal federal tax 
rate on capital gains was cut from almost 50 percent to 20 percent -- but total individual capital gains tax 
receipts increased from $9.1 billion to $26.5 billion."</i><p>
<p>
--American Council for Capital Formation, January 1995<p>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
	In 1989, then-Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D-ME) single-handedly killed a capital gains tax cut.  Mitchell's dedication to class warfare and blind-eye towards the benefits for all capital -- income levels from capital gains tax reduction cost the economy untold growth and opportunity -- businesses that were never created or expanded, new jobs never added to the economy, and products and services never made available to consumers.<p>

	President George Bush refused to make another serious push for capital gains tax reduction.  
Indeed, he sacrificed his no-new-taxes pledge and ultimately his presidency the following year by signing 
on to a deficit reduction package that raised taxes, failed to actually cut spending, and didn't reduce the 
deficit.<p>

	Today we have a new Congress looking to do buisness in a new way.  the House of 
Representatives has passed a tax cut package -- including capital gains tax rate reduction (top rate of 19.8 percent for individuals and 25 percent for corporations) and indexing gains for inflation.  Indexing capital gains and reducing the capital gains tax rate was by far the most pro-growth plank in the House 
Republicans' "Contract with America."  For the small buisness, entrepreneurial sector of the economy, 
capital gains tax reduction means greater access to capital for investment and growth.  If America truly has a new Senate in 1995, then the mistakes of 1989 will not be repeated and capital gains tax reduction will be enacted.<p>

<b>Tax Cuts for Growth and Spending Cuts for Deficit Reduction</b> However, some Senators seem to be unable to grasp the concept that cutting taxes and reducing the deficit can be achieved simultaneously.  Many claim such actions to be contradictory.  They are not.  The supply-side economics concept of "policy levers" can help to make this clearer.<p>

	Briefly, the policy lever concept states that policies should directed at the area of the economy where they hold a comparative advantage.  For example, the lone goal of monetary policy, or the monetary lever, should be to achieve price stability.  Meanwhile, the fiscal lever should be geared toward promoting economic growth by enhancing incentives for working, saving, investing, and entrepreneurship.  Misunderstanding how the economy works, old-line Keynesian economists claim that such actions are contradictory.  Yet, tight money and tax cuts in the 1980s cured stagflation and placed the U.S. economy on a robust growth path.<p>
 
	Likewise, the concept of policy levers can help us with the current dilemma regarding tax cuts and the deficit.  As noted, the fiscal lever should be positioned to promote growth.  Therefore, reducing capital gains tax rates and indexing returns for inflation makes sense -- i.e., the tax lever should be moved in a pro-growth direction.  Meanwhile, the spending lever should then be adjusted so as to deal with the deficit.  Quite simply, if the fiscal lever is going to promote economic growth, then taxes must be cut and deficits dealt with through spending cuts.<p>
 
	Tax increases only work to slow economic growth, thereby boosting government spending, 
shrinking the tax base, and actually expanding the deficit.  Meanwhile, pro-growth tax cuts along with 
spending restraint amount to the most sensible fiscal policy -- the combination of a growing economy, an expanding tax base, and prudent spending policies will shrink the deficit.<p>
 
	Tax cuts and deficit reduction do not have to be mutually exclusive.  The formula for sound fiscal policy is clear: tax cuts for economic growth and spending cuts for deficit reduction.<p>
 
<b>Boosting Entrepreneurship.</b>  Make no mistake, shifting tax policy into a growth mode through capital gains tax rate reduction and indexing, while reducing government spending, will serve to boost the small business, entrepreneurial sector of the economy -- where job creation occurs.  Indeed, considering that access to capital remains probably the biggest obstacle for small business and entrepreneurs, it is difficult to think of a more damaging levy to small business than the capital gains tax.  Entrepreneurs need capital to start up new businesses, to expand existing enterprises, and to create jobs.</p>
 
	<i>In effect, capital gains tax reduction is the best "jobs program" government can institute.</i>
 
	If the Senate wants to ensure that entrepreneurs gain access to capital, then it will:  
 
<ul>

<li>Reduce the top capital gains tax rate to 19.8 percent on individuals, as the House did (the 
corporate rate on capital gains would drop to 25 percent); 

<li>Index gains for inflation.  Unfortunately, the House tax cut only allows for indexing from the 
beginning of 1995, no matter when the asset was acquired.  The Senate should provide for full indexing for inflation from the time the asset actually was acquired, and insist on this in joint conference with the 
House.  Full indexing would unlock trillions of dollars of capital for investment in new and expanding 
businesses.
</ul>
<p>
	In the end, however, Congress should shift the fiscal policy lever into full growth mode by 
eliminating capital gains taxes altogether.<p>

<title>Stop Government Hostile Takeovers of Family Businesses</title>

<h2>Stop Government Hostile Takeovers of</h2>
<h2>Family Businesses: Repeal the Estate Tax</h2>
</center>

<hr>
<i>"Interestingly, for a tax that is supposed to inflict such little pain, people have devoted a great deal of ingenuit to getting around [the estate tax]."</i><p>

-- Economist Bruce Bartlett in his book  Reaganomics<p>


<i>"The U.S. is virtually the only country in the world that imposes significant income and death taxes on the worldwide income and assets of every citizen, even if the citizen is domiciled elsewhere."</i><p>

--Robert Lenzner and Phillippe Mao, "The New Refugees," Forbes 11/221/94<p>


<i>"It's basically cheaper to give away a business than to die owning it."</i><p>

--Frank Rainaldi quoted Investor's Buisness Daily, 4/12/95<p>
<hr>

	At various points in the history of modern-day capitalism, concerns have been raised regarding hostile takeovers of business entities.  Worries over general corporate instability, excessive debt, and job losses often arise when an individual or firm attempts seize the reins of a corporation against the wishes of current management.  In fact, though, hostile takeovers remain a source of dynamism in a free enterprise system -- often removing moribund, inefficient management, finding ways to add value and increase production, and boosting the economy.<p>

	<i>One kind of hostile takeover distinctly anti-free enterprise, though, and worthy of harsh criticism is the federal estate tax, along with the gift and generation-skipping taxes.</i>  After working hard, paying taxes, and establishing a business over a lifetime, thegovernment moves in to claim up to 60 percent of an individual's assets upon death -- a hostile takeover, if you will.  And a target for government raiders under the guise of the estate tax are family businesses.<p>

<b>Insurance to Pay Taxes.</b>  To fend off such government takeovers, family business owners channel large amounts of resources into relatively unproductive endeavors in order to pass business on to the next generation.  Legions of accountants explore creative ways to shield assets from death taxes.  Indeed, individuals may purchase life insurance for the sole purpose of paying estate taxes. Insurance is not cheap, however, and remains out of reach for many individuals working hard to keep their businesses afloat, or if purchased, diverts resources away from productive investment.  A clear indication of a tax system gone awry is when insurance is being bought to cover the costs of taxation.<p>

<b>Killing Businesses.</b>  Most often, the need to pay estate taxes winds up killing family-owned businesses.  In fact, 60 percent of family-owned businesses fail to make it to the second generation, and 90 percent do not make it to the third generation.<a href="#foot1">1</a>  Estate taxes in play a significant role in this development.  Perhaps most detrimental is the fact that the government is stripping a company of much-needed capital at the worst possible juncture -- under a change of ownership and oversight. Most businesses simply never recover.<p>

	Heavy estate taxation also acts as a disincentive for investment and entrepreneurship, just as onerous income and capital gains taxes do.  With 55 percent of a business enterprise essentially slated for a government takeover, there remains little incentive for individuals to continue to invest and expand a family business when the owner reaches a certain age.  Rather, business owners possess every incentive to sell their family businesses before death to spare their heirs the costs and burdens of a hostile government takeover via estate taxes.<p>

<b>Tax Rates.</b>  Federal estate tax rates range effectively from 37 percent up to 55 percent, plus an additional 5 percent on very large estates.  <i>It is important to understand the fact that this is not 55 percent of income, it is 55 percent of all assets in an estate.</i>  The first $600,000 is exempt from taxation.  (The Contract with America proposal, which recently passed the U.S. House of Representatives, increases the estate tax exemption to $750,000.)<p>

	The gift tax is levied at the same rates as the estate tax, excluding $10,000 per recipient annually.  In addition, a generation-skipping tax is imposed on gifts and bequests to grandchildren.  The generation-skipping tax is levied at an additional, flat rate of 55 percent on amounts in excess of $1 million.<p>

<b>Tax Revenues.</b>  As is always the case when government pushes tax rates too high, tax revenues are relatively insignificant.  As already noted, high estate tax rates intensify tax avoidance efforts and create disincentives for investment, saving, and entrepreneurship.  <i>In 1994, estate and gift taxes accounted for a mere 1.2 percent of total federal government receipts, or $15.2 billion.  Between 1974 and 1994, there has been virtually no inflation-adjusted increase in federal estate and gift tax revenues (only a 0.6 percent increase).</i>  In addition, a good portion of these revenues are eaten up by the federal government's compliance efforts related to estate and other death taxes -- some estimates say as much as 75 percent of estate and gift tax collections are offset by the costs of the IRS, the Treasury Department, and litigation.<a href="#foot2">2</a><p>

<b>Economic Growth and Job Creation.</b>  In the 1970s, Australia and Canada repealed their estate taxes.  While not exactly bastions of free-market economics, both these nations came to realize that estate levies were hurting investment, economic growth and job creation.

	In the most extreme cases, the U.S. tax structure has pushed many upper-income individuals to reject their citizenship, taking up official residence in less-taxing lands.  Again, estate taxes play a major part in such decisions.  <i>Forbes</i> magazine ran a cover story about such individuals entitled "The New Refugees" in its November 21, 1994 issue.  While some might say, "Good riddance to such traitors," the economics underlying the situation should be reviewed.<p>

	A simple question arises: Why does the U.S. impose such a punitive tax code to the point where productive individuals will take the dramatic step of renouncing their citizenship in order to prosper elsewhere? Though the problem of taxing productive individuals out of a country is not new one.  In the late eighteenth century, the great economist Adam Smith warned in <i>The Wealth of Nations</i>:

	<blockquote>"The proprietor of stock is properly a citizen of the world, and is not necessarily attached to any particular country.  He would be apt to abandon the country in which he was exposed to a vexatious inquisition, in order to be assessed to a burdensome tax, and would remove his stock to some other country where he could either carry on his business, or enjoy his fortune more at his ease.  By removing his stock he would put an end to all the industry which it had maintained in the country which he left."</blockquote>

This observation takes on even greater significance considering today's worldwide competition for increasingly mobile capital -- made even more mobile through global electronic transfers of funds.<p>

	A 1993 study by the Center for the Study of Taxation estimated the economic impact of repealing estate taxes in the United States.  The study estimated that under a no-estate-tax scenario by the year 2000, GDP would be $79.2 billion higher, 228,000 more jobs would be created, and $630 billion more in savings and capital would accumulate.<p>

<b>End Government Hostile Takeovers.</b>  In the private sector, a hostile takeover often means that the owners (i.e., shareholders) of the targeted company will benefit as their shares in the firm increase in price.  Under the government's hostile takeovers of thousands of family-owned businesses each year via the estate and other death taxes, heirs are decimated as the government often lays claim to more than half the company's assets.  Resources are funneled away from productive, private-sector ventures to often-dubious, unproductive government programs.<p>

	The only justification for estate taxes is envy -- a desire to perpetuate class warfare and worn-out, failed government redistribution schemes.  But as we all know, envy is a poor foundation upon which to base a tax code.  Sound economics is preferable.  The economics of estate taxes tells us that such levies create disincentives to invest, save, and take risks; reduce economic growth and job creation; and are expensive to administer. The time has come to repeal the estate and other death taxes in the United States.  Government's hostile takeovers of family businesses and assets must come to an end.  If not, the government will continue to destroy America's free enterprise system and our great heritage of family-owned businesses.<p>

<h2>The Facts About Capital Gains Tax Reduction</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<i>"History shows that class warfare does not make for good economic policy."</i><p>

-- Sydney Hoff-Hay, SBSC Board Member, in testimony before the U.S. House Committee on Small Business, 1/26/95.<p>


<i>"While I fully support the elimination of the capital gains tax, the reduction and indexation ... in the Contract With America would result in lower capital costs, increased capital formation, new and higher-paying jobs, and increased investment in start-up enterprises, as well as business expansions."</i><p>

-- Richard Rahn, Ph.D., SBSC Board Member, in testimony before the U.S. House Committee on Small Business, 2/22/95.<p>


<i>"As long as risk-taking is punished, growth will be smothered.... I genuinely believe we will open the 21st century without a tax on capital gains, as we opened the 20th century."</i><p>

--Jude Wanniski, economist, before the U.S. Senate, 2/15/95.<p>
<hr>

	Much-needed capital gains tax reduction has been placed on hold since then-Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell almost single-handedly killed it in 1989. During the 1992 campaign, thenpresidential candidate Bill Clinton mentioned the possibility of indexing capital gains for inflation. Nevertheless, President Clinton has voiced opposition to capital gains tax reduction.<p>

Finally, the House Republican "Contract With America" called for significant capital gains tax reduction -- a 50 percent capital gains exclusion from taxation, effectively dropping the top tax rate for individuals from 28 percent to 19.8 percent, and prospective indexing for inflation. At a minimum, <i>the Small Business Survival Committee supports the Houseplanfor capital gains tax reduction, but urges the complete elimination of capital gains taxes.</i><p>

Our bold stance on the capital gains front is based on the facts, which are so often left out of the capital gains tax debate:<p>

<b>Improved Incentives for Investment and Entrepreneurship.</b> Investment and entrepreneurship are the driving forces behind economic growth and job creation. The economy needs individuals who are willing to undertake the great risks of investing sweat and/or capital in new and expanding businesses -- cssentially in new ideas.<p>

	Capital gains taxes raise the costs of such enterprises -reducing potential returns, and thereby reducing risk taking, investment, and economic growth. <i>Basic economics tells us that cutting or eliminaneg the capital-gains tax will enhance incentivesfor investment and entrepreneurship.</i><p>

<b>Widespread Benefits.</b> Critics of capital gains tax reduction illustrate great ignorance when asserting that a capital gains tax cut "will only benefft the rich."<p>

	<i>First</i>, improving incentives for investment and entrepreneurship has widespread economic benefits -- greater competition, more products and services for consumers, greater economic growth, and <i>more jobs</i>. After all, employees need employers. Providing incentives for individuals to expand existing businesses or to create new enterprises is the engine of job creation.  Absurdly, critics seem to think that individuals and the economy somehow benefit from taking resources away from venture capitalists, investors, and entrepreneurs, and giving it to the government.  <i>The problem remains that while government can redistribute, and even destroy, it cannot create</i>.<p>

	Second, capital gains are spread across a wide income spectrum.  According to 1992 federal income tax returns (most recent available), 56 percent of returns claiming capital gains were from incomes of $50,000 or less, 73 percent of returns with capital gains were from incomes of less than $75,000, while incomes of less than $100,000 claimed 83 percent of returns with capital gains.<p>

	Third, any discussion of which income levels derive direct benefits from capital gains tax reduction will be misleading because capital gains are included in the measurement of income.  Therefore, individuals who perhaps claim one-time or very infrequent capital gains income can be launched into a considerably higher income bracket <i>for only the year in which the capital gain is claimed</i>.  Opponents of capital gains tax cuts misleadingly claim that the rich capture the benefits of tax cuts without mentioning the facts about income measurement.<p>

	<i>Fourth</i>, even if <i>all</i> the direct benefits of capital gains tax reduction accrued to the "rich" -- which they do not -- one must ask: Who possesses better incentives to invest money more wisely, a rich person investing his own money or a government bureaucrat spending the taxpayers' money?<p>

<b>Double Taxation</b>.  Capital gains taxes represent a form of double taxation,  Individuals pay taxes on income they earn, and then choose to either save, invest, or consume their after-tax dollars.  The federal government does not tax consumption, but certainly does tax the benefits of saving and investing.  <i>Eliminating capital gains taxes, as well as taxes on interest earned from saving, alleviates the bias against saving and investment</i>.<p>

<b>Equalizing Tax Treatment of Capital Gains with Government Debt</b>.  Interest on most state and local government debt instruments are not subject to federal taxation, while capital gains are taxed.  This tax structure makes no economic sense.  Government securities present few risks for investors, while investments in private-sector equities, business expansion, and new enterprises offer considerable risks.  In addition, government debt generally finances rather unproductive government projects and programs, while capital gains are generated by successful private-sector enterprises that boost the economy, expand the tax base, and create real jobs.  <i>Clearly, capital gains income should receive the same tax treatment as interest on state and local government debt</i>.<p>

<b>Capital Gains Tax Reduction and Federal Tax Revenues</b>.  Static government analyses project revenue losses from capital gains tax reduction.  However, as the top tax rate on capital gains declined from almost 50 percent to 20 percent between 1978 and 1985, capital gains tax receipts <i>increased</i> from $9.1 billion to $26.5 billion.<a href="#foot1">1</a>  In contrast, the 1986 Tax Reform Act hiked the capital gains tax rate by 40 percent -- from 20 percent to 28 percent -- but by 1992 capital gains tax revenues registered about the same amount as were collected in 1985 (far less in real terms).  Naturally, the increase in the capital gains tax rate resulted in far lower capital gains realizations.<p>

	After all, the economy is dynamic, not static.  Therefore, individuals will alter their economic behavior according to the incentives established by governmental policies.  Even the complete elimination of capital gains taxes on individuals does not mean that the federal government will lose all of the $26 billion or so it collects from this levy because investment and entrepreneurship will respond positively, spurring growth and creating revenue feedback for the federal government through other levies.<p>

<b>International Treatment of Capital Gains</b>.  Most of our top international competitors -- including Japan and Germany -- do not tax capital gains as harshly as the U.S. does.  In fact, <i>nations like Hong Kong, the Netherlands, and Germany do not tax capital gains income at all</i>.<p>

	Even nations like Great Britain and Australia who tax capital gains at 40 percent and 48.3 percent, respectively -- higher rates than the U.S. -- adjust asset prices for inflation.  Once inflation is factored into the equation, the <i>real</i> U.S. capital gains tax rate jumps much higher than the stated rate of 28 percent -- often well in excess of 50 percent.  In fact, many U.S. taxpayers wind up paying taxes on <i>real</i> capital losses.<p>

	In addition, most states and some cities levy their own capital gains taxes -- pushing the total capital gains tax rate even higher.<p>

<b>Unlocking Past Gains and Improving Economic Efficiency</b>.  Literally trillions of dollars are locked into investments at present because high tax rates, especially after adjusting for inflation, create significant disincentives for investors to sell.  <i>Eliminating capital gains taxes would unlock huge amounts of capital -- that are artificially locked in because of current tax treatment of capital gains income -- to be reinvested in new and growing ventures</i>.

	When one moves past the class warfare rhetoric and nonsensical arguments against capital gains tax reduction, the economics are clear.  <i>Sharply reducing or eliminating capital gains taxes increases potential returns on investment and entrepreneurship, thereby promoting economic growth and job creation</i>.

<h2>Competition and Common Sense:</h2>
<h2>The Two Essential Ingredients for Constructive</h2>
<h2>Health Care Reform</h2>

By Raymond J. Keating
</center>
<hr>

<i>"Anyone familiar with my career in public service knows I strongly favor the social goals of relieving poverty and enhancing the quality of life for all people.  Not one American should be denied access to health care.  But in trying to collect the costs from business, we assume every employer can effectively play a national version of the street corner shell game, with the consumer paying the bill.  But consumers have choices and some businesses have real limitations on what they can charge for products or services.  When government is unmindful of these dynamics, it often means loss of employment for those we seek to help."<p>
</i>
--George McGovern, Insight, 4/26/93<p>


<i>"According to ... the CATO Institute, MSAs would lower the nation's annual health care bill by $33 billion"</i><p>

--National Center for Policy Analysis, Health Care Briefing Book<p>

<hr>

	The misguided effort by President and Mrs. Clinton to further inject government into the U.S. health care system thankfully died in 1994.  However, the underlying struture that makes health care so costly still lives on -- i.e., an expanded definition of "insurance," the prevailing use of third-party payments, and government regulations which prevent innovative methods for making health care affordable and accessible.  in addition, self-employed entrepreneurs and uninsured individuals are not given equal tax treatment in terms of their health care expenditures as is received by employer-based insurance plans.<p>

	In order to control costs, increase choices, and further enhance quality, <i>market-based</i> health care reforms are needed.  The byer-seller relationsh8ip between consumers and suppliers of health care services needs to be re-established.  Under a thrd-party system of payments, neither consumer nor provider have an incentive to be concerned about costs.  Therefore, costs naturally rise.<p>

	There are two veins to thise thrid-party payment system.  First, government involvement in the health care market has increased, especially since the inception of Medicaid and Medicare in the mid-1960s.  Second, the concept of "insurance" has been vastly expanded. By definition, insurance is supposd to cover  catastrophic and unforeseen events.  Today, health insurance plans cover small and predictable expenses.  Such a perversion of health insurance would be the equivalent of extending one's home-owners insurance to cover the costs of mowing the law, trimming and painting the house.<p>

	Make no mistakes, third-party payments have increased dramatically over the past three decades.  For example, according to economist Ed Rebenstein in his book <i>Right Data</i>, in 1950 government fianced 25.3 percent of health care expenditures, private insurance 15.8 percent, and 58.9 percentcovered out of pocket.  As of 1965, government's share had risen to 26.2 percent, private insurance rose to 28.1 percent, while out-of-pocket fiancing fell to 45.7 percent.  By 1990, government fianced health care expenditures reached 42.4 percent, private insurance hit 37.2 percent, with out-of-pocket fiancing falling to a mere 20.4 percent.  According to the <i>Statistical Abstract of the United States</i> 1994, in 1991, government fianced expenditures equaled 43.9 percent, private insurance and other private sources 36.9 percent, and 19.2 percent out of pocket.<p>

	The effect of this usurpation of the buyer-seller relationship has been clear -- rising costs.  For example, per capita U.S. health care expenditures between 1965 and 1991 increased by 1,306 percent, versus a rise in the consumer price index of 332 percent.<p>

	The Small Business Survival Committee believes that two reform measures by the 104th Congress and the Administration would go a long way in curing what ails the health care marketplace.<p>

<b>Medical Savings Accounts.</b> Incentives need to be established so that individuals can save to cover the costs of standard, predictable health care expenses out of pocket, while also purchasing catastrophic health care insurance.  Allowing individuals to establish tax-free medical savings accounts (MSAs) would provide the basis for such a system.<p>

	The most common MSA scenario would have employers and employees shifting payments from a standard health plan to a split system of an MSA and a catastrophic plan.  For example, a standard plan costing $5,000 could be replaced with $3,000 going into an employee's MSA ($2,500 from the employer and $500 from the employee) and $2,000 covering a catastrophic plan with a $3,000 deductible.<p>

	The employee withdraws funds from the MSA, penalty free, to pay out-of-pocket medical expenses.  Since the employee has an established "budget" and is able to keep what he does not use by the end of the year, the employee has an incentive to spend more prudently and comparison shop for health care purchases.  After all, <i>the critical issue in making health care more accessible is to make it more affordable.</i>  If consumers become more concerned with costs, health care providers are forced to be more cost sensitive in pricing health care services.<p>

	Also, many individuals would be able to build up a large amount of savings in their MSAs, which in turn would help offset health care costs in case the employee lost his job.  Such a plan could be designed to help the poor as well -- eventually replacing Medicaid, and its daunting bureaucracy and costs, with health care vouchers that could be deposited in MSAs.  Again, this would go a long way in helping to alleviate some of the high costs associated with third-party payers, in the case of Medicaid, the government.<p>

	In places where MSA plans already are being tried, the results have been quite positive.  For example:<p>

<ul>
<li>A recent study (January 11, 1995) by the Evergreen Freedom Foundation in Olympia, Washington reviewed MSA plans currently in use.  They found that the use of MSAs generated "reduced health care spending by sponsors/employers and employees; wiser use of health services by consumers; greater use of preventive services; increased consumer involvement in health care decisions and purchases; dollar savings and improved choice for healthy and ill people; MSA preference by low-income employees; [and] strong employee participation and satisfaction."

<li>Also, the Evergreen report noted that the MSA plan instituted by Forbes, Inc. has reduced insurance premiums by 27 percent since 1991.

<li>According to a survey by The Luntz Research Companies, 98 percent of the employees at Golden Rule Insurance (Indianapolis, Indiana) enrolled in the companys MSA plan are satisfied with the program.  Ninety percent of Golden Rules employees have chosen to enroll in the plan, with the average enrollee accumulating $1,002 in refunds in 1994.  About half of those receiving refunds planned to spend the money on living expenses, holiday gifts and other items, while the other half planned on keeping their money in an interest-bearing MSA reserve account or investing the money in other ways.  Total employee refunds for 1993 and 1994 amounted to $1.2 million.  In addition, for the second straight year using MSAs, Golden Rule has had no rate increase.
</ul><p>

<b>Equalized Tax Treatment of Health Care Expenditures for the Self-Employed and Uninsured.</b>  The current tax system allows full tax deductibility for employer-provided health insurance, but denies such treatment to out-of-pocket health care expenditures and self-employed individuals.  In order to ensure that individuals and entrepreneurs can afford health care, their health care expenses -- whether for insurance or out-of-pocket payments -- should be allowed full tax deductibility.<p>

	The current system of only allowing full tax deductibility for employer-provided insurance benefits larger companies and their employees, leaving entrepreneurs and uninsured workers behind.  Extending 100-percent deductibility to entrepreneurs merely levels the playing field.  In turn, full deductibility may help to foster entrepreneurship.  Many individuals are unwilling to undertake the risks of starting a new business because once they leave the security of being an employee in an established firm, they may lose health care benefits.  Allowing for 100-percent deductibility would give an added incentive for individuals to start their own businesses.<p>

	Unbelievably, Congress and the Administration even allowed the 25-percent deduction for health insurance premiums paid by the self-employed to expire last year.  As a first step, Congress should reinstate this 25-percent deduction immediately (which will still require many individuals to file amended tax returns), and then phase in the 100-percent deduction.<p>

	
	MSAs and full tax deductibility for individuals and entrepreneurs are the kind of market-oriented health care reform measures that will provide greater access to care, enhanced choice for health care consumers, while providing incentives to control costs.  Health care reform may be the arena where the degree of real change brought about by this past election will be measured.  In fact, House Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer (R-Tx.) is expected to introduce a bill shortly that will include MSAs.<p>

	A government-driven health care plan is one of a primary reason that the Clinton Administration is taking on water.  Market-driven health care reforms could buoy the new Congress.<p>

<title>Eliminating Capital Gains Taxes</title>

<h2>Eliminating Capital Gains Taxes:<br>
Lifeblood for an Entrepreneurial Economy</h2><p>
by Raymond J. Keating<p>
</center>
<hr>

<i>"[W]e have to cut the rate on capital gains, which is ... a vacuum sucking up our capital savings into the general treasury."<p></i>

-- U.S. Rep. Bill Archer.<p>
<p>

<i>"Better yet, eliminate capital-gains taxes entirely."</i><p>

-- Ed Rubenstein, Economics Analyst, National Review<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>"Investors are naturally reluctant to support new ventures in decaying urban neighborhoods where theft, drug abuse, violent crime and buisness bankruptcy rates are all very high.  This source of venture capital will not be tapped until sufficient incentives make inner-city investment more attractive to individual backers.  Conversely, reducing the tax on capital gains effectively increases the flow of fiancial 'seed corn' to budding entrepreneurs."<p>
</i>
-- Wall Street Journal op-ed, 8/25/93, by the chairman and four members of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights.<p>
<p>
<hr>
Most entrepreneurs seeking to start up or expand an enterprise will tell you of a major obstacle -- raising capital.  The answer to this problem is not a proliferation of governmental entities siphoning taxpayer funds to fledgling businesses.  Instead, encouragement for private-sector investment in small business needs to be enhanced.<p>

Investment and entrepreneurship are the lifeblood of a vibrant economy.  There is no more important economic task than investing both	sweat and capital in new ideas, innovations, and enterprises.  Yet, the risky nature of such ventures often scares off bank lending officers.  Therefore, venture capital, whether raised from one's family and friends or from professional investors, remains a critical source of funding for entrepreneurial enterprises.<p>

In the economic world of risk-and-reward tradeoffs, the <i>opportunity</i> for high returns must be present in order to entice investment in such high-risk ventures.  Capital gains taxes significantly cut into those returns, thereby diminishing incentives to invest.<p>

The Republican majorities in both houses of the new Congress are considering a reduction in the federal capital gains tax rate, and indexing the rate for inflation.  These are crucial steps to igniting entrepreneurship and investment in the U.S. economy, and thereby stimulating economic growth and job creation.  Though, <i>in order to make the United States a capital haven and an economic-growth juggernaut, taxes on capital gains should be eliminated altogether.</i><p>

<h3>Indexation</h3>

The nominal rate of federal taxation on capital gains income is 28 percent.<a href="#foot1">1</a>   However, when inflation is factored into the capital gains equation the <i>real</i> capital gains tax rate rises substantially.<p>

For example, an individual that made a $10,000 venture capital investment in 1987, and sold it for $15,000 in 1993, would owe $1,400 in federal capital gains taxes at the 28 percent rate.  However, when factoring inflation (we use the gross domestic product deflator) into this equation, the real capital gains tax rate on this transaction jumps to 53 percent.<a href="#foot2">2</a><p>

The lack of indexation creates additional disincentives for investment and entrepreneurship, restraining small-business growth and job creation.  In fact, some individuals can wind up paying taxes on <i>real capital losses</i>.  That is, after factoring inflation into the equation, a nominal profit on a transaction can turn out to be a real loss, yet the investor still pays taxes on the nominal gain.<p>

Depending on the Federal Reserve's success in maintaining stable prices, the real capital gains tax rate can fluctuate considerably as well.  Figure 1 offers an example of how the Fed's efforts, or lack thereof, to fight inflation can impact capital gains tax rates.  Listed are the real capital gains tax rates from 1977 through 1993 on three-year investments yielding a total nominal return of 30 percent.  It is assumed that the investment is closed out at the end of the stated year, for example, the 1985 real capital gains tax rate relates to an investment made at the beginning of 1983 and sold at the end of 1985.<p>

<hr>	These real rates of capital gaasdfbacsadfasdfsfdwerwerqwerq4ins taxation 	represent severe impediments to keeping America's economy vibrant and growing.  A 28 percent capital gains tax rate acts as a considerable disincentive to investment, while real rates ranging from 40 percent to 494 percent to even paying taxes on a real capital loss, amount to economic suicide.  Indexation would eliminate inflation as a factor in capital gains determination -- equalizing stated and real capital gains tax rates.  The lower real rate would reduce uncertainty, and generate investment, economic growth, and job creation.<p>

<h3>From Cutting to Eliminating the Capital Gains Tax</h3>

	Members of the new Congress are considering a reduction in the capital gains tax rate from 28 percent to 19.8 percent by providing for a 50-percent exclusion on capital gains income.   Combined with indexation, reducing the top capital gains tax rate to 19.8 percent could be the most pro-growth step taken by the new Congress.<p>

	However, given the critical and high-risk nature of investment and entrepreneurship, and  the importance of maintaining a competitive environment in a global economy, capital gains should be excluded from taxation altogether.  A zero percent capital gains tax rate would ensure that entrepreneurial risk taking, so crucial to economic growth, would not be impeded by the U.S. federal tax code.<p>

	Figure 2 offers a comparison of capital gains tax rates among various nations.  The current U.S. non-indexed capital gains tax rate is not competitive internationally.  Even the two nations -- Australia and the United Kingdom -- with higher nominal rates than the United States allow for capital gains to be indexed for inflation.  Hence, the U.S. real capital gains tax rate often will exceed the rate in Australia and the U.K., depending on U.S. inflation.<p>

	From a capital gains perspective, these other nations offer a more conducive and dynamic environment for investment and entrepreneurship.  In a competitive, global economy, a zero percent capital gains tax rate would make the United States a magnet for capital.  Eliminating the capital gains tax would be the most pro-growth, proactive jobs program taken by the new Congress.<p>

<h3>The Growth Effects</h3>

	The potential benefits of eliminating the capital gains tax are clear.  Figure 3, for example, notes that venture capital investment was on the rise as the U.S. capital gains tax rate declined up to 1986; followed by a dramatic downturn as the rate was hiked 40 percent in 1987, from 20 percent to 28 percent.  Eliminating the capital gains tax would  augment incentives to invest in new and expanding ventures.<p>

	In a report released earlier this year,<a href="#foot3">3</a> and reported on in the Small Business Survival Committee's July 1994 <i>Small Business and the Economy</i> newsletter, economists Gary and Aldona Robbins estimated the economic impact of eliminating the federal capital gains tax.  By the year 2000, the Robbins' projected that a zero percent capital gains tax rate would lead to: <p>

<ul>
<li>an additional $3.2 trillion in capital formation;
<li>the creation of 1.1 million additional jobs;
<li>an extra $1.6 trillion in GDP between 1994 and 2000, with annual GDP $391 billion higher than otherwise by the year 2000;
<li>an additional 0.43 percentage points on the long-term annual growth rate for the economy.
</ul><p>

<h3>Government Revenues</h3>

	Gary and Aldona Robbins also noted that much of the lost revenue to the federal government would be recaptured due to enhanced economic growth resulting from the elimination of the capital gains tax.  In fact, when accounting for higher state and local revenues due to a higher rate of growth, they estimate that all levels of government would <i>net</i> $25 billion annually by the year 2000.<p>

	The Robbins' "dynamic" assumptions regarding the recapturing of revenues due to enhanced economic growth are much more realistic than the "static" models normally employed by critics of capital gains tax reduction.  After all, the economy is dynamic -- in the sense that individuals respond to incentives.  People are not static economic variables.<p>

	However, even if one is forced to employ unrealistic, static assumptions regarding revenue projections, the case for eliminating the capital gains tax still stands.  The purpose for eliminating capital gains taxes is to spur investment, entrepreneurship, and economic growth and opportunity.  If that means cutting government spending more deeply than might be called for under a more realistic, dynamic assessment of revenues, so be it.<p>

<h3>Who Benefits?</h3>

	Opponents will employ class warfare tactics, and argue that a capital gains tax is merely a sop to the wealthy.  However, capital gains taxes are not levies on the wealthy, but levies on wealth creation.  As argued here, the benefits of eliminating capital gains levies will be felt throughout the economy as economic growth accelerates.  Simply speaking, you can't have job creation without capital investment and entrepreneurs.<p>

	In addition, capital gains tend to be spread across a wider income spectrum than many believe.  As noted in Figure 4, based on 1992 federal income tax returns (most recent available), 56 percent of returns claiming capital gains were from incomes of $50,000 or less, including the capital gain.  As Figure 5 shows, total incomes of less than $100,000, including capital gains, claimed 83 percent of returns with capital gains.<a href="#foot4">4</a><p>

<h3>Wages and Interest vs. Capital Gains</h3>

	In addition to their false assumptions about large revenue losses and the identification of capital gains just with the wealthy, opponents of cutting or eliminating capital gains taxes often argue that no reason exists for differing tax treatments between capital gains and, for example, wage or interest income.<p>

	In fact, there is a distinct difference between wage or even interest income and capital gains -- risk.  Capital gains come from growth and appreciation of investments, which tend to carry greater risks than those associated with earning wages or even interest.  In particular, investments in small, entrepreneurial ventures carry significant risk.  As already noted, high-risk ventures must at least present the opportunity for high rewards.<p>

<h3>Small Business and the Economy Will Benefit From a 0% Capital Gains Tax Rate</h3>

	Small business is the engine of economic growth and job creation.  In order to undertake and/or expand a small business, one needs capital.  Without adequate capital, new ideas and businesses either never make it to the marketplace or they die a premature death.  And with such deaths also go products, services, and jobs.  By eliminating the capital gains tax, Congress and the Administration would greatly strengthen incentives for investment and entrepreneurship -- boosting economic growth and opportunity.<p>

	History shows that class warfare does not make for good economic policy.  In fact, during the 1980s, while tax rates declined, upper-income individuals paid a greater share of total income taxes, as the benefits of tax shelters declined and the rewards for working, saving and investment rose.  In this environment, from 1980 to 1989, 18 million jobs were created, and the employment ratio<a href="#head5">5</a> reached a record-high 63 percent in 1989.<p>

	The 1986 Tax Reform Act made positive strides by reducing personal and corporate tax rates, but went awry by trying to "pay" for these reductions with an increase in the capital gains tax rate.  Indeed, the economy paid a price for this capital gains tax hike in the form reduced venture capital investment and restrained entrepreneurship.<p>

	The time has come to unleash entrepreneurial capitalism by eliminating the capital gains tax.<p>

<title>Kerrigan:  Why state health-care reforms are failing -- SBSC</title>
</HEAD>

<i>November 1995</i>
<hr>
<h2>Why state health-care reforms are failing</h2>
by Karen Kerrigan
<P>
</center><hr><P>
 While President and Mrs. Clinton appear to have
put aside their interest in the nation's so-called &quot;health-care
crisis&quot; for now, the issue has not gone away - especially
for small businesses and entrepreneurs struggling to purchase
insurance for themselves and their employees.
<P>
Washington terms such as &quot;employer mandates&quot; &quot;community
rating&quot; and &quot;guaranteed issue&quot; have suddenly become
staple household vocabulary due to television commercials and
radio talk show hosts.  Ad ideological clashes still exist on
how to make health insurance more accessible and affordable for
all Americans.
<P>
The Clinton plan modeled previously enacted state-based reforms
to achieve universal coverage.  Opposing sides of the debate have
each provided their own analysis of what would occur upon implementation
of the state reforms on a national scale.
<P>
According to Clinton plan advocates, health-care heaven-on-earth
would ensue, while critics have claimed a massive case of the
health-care horrors.
<P>
With the passing of another year, though, the results of these
state reforms have become much clearer.  The reforms included
in the Clinton plan have produced distorted consequences for both
policy holders and insurance companies.
<P>
Experts point to two very specific reforms that have caused headaches
for state legislators and governors who believed making everyone
pay the same insurance rates, and letting consumers get insurance
whenever they needed, was sound public policy.
<P>
Community rating and guaranteed issue became the foundation of
these now-failing reforms.  Pure community rating requires that
everyone pay the same premiums for health insurance regardless
of their age or health risks.  So a healthy 28-year-old pays the
same rate as a 58-year-old smoker.
<P>
For most younger people, who have fewer health risks, logical
economic decision-making forces them to drop coverage.  The massive
decrease in policy holders, especially healthy ones, has driven
companies to jack their rates even higher, causing additional
budget-wary consumers to drop insurance.
<P>
Guaranteed issue essentially requires insurance companies to supply
health insurance to all individuals no matter what their medical
disposition at the time.  Under this scenario, the incentive for
individuals to avoid paying for health insurance until they are
confronted with a serious medical problem are clear.
<P>
The increased costs for insurers are substantial and obviously
passed along to consumers in terms of either higher insurance
rates of fewer insurance choices.
<P>
States have not found the promised utopian effect from these reforms.
 Instead, thousands are dropping their health-care plans altogether
because of skyrocketing premium rates.  In effect, fewer people
have health-care insurance and fewer are in the market to purchase
policies because of high rates as well as the incentive to buy
insurance only when needed.
<P>
States now find that health-care accessibility and affordability
problems have become far worse, not better.  For example:
<UL>
<LI> New York imposed community rating on the small and individual
insurance market in 1993.  Since then, several major insurers
simply stopped serving the market altogether, and by some estimates
more than 500,000 New Yorkers dropped their coverage due to skyrocketing
costs.    
</UL>

<P>
The New York Department of Insurance reported that in some cases,
rates for a single, 30-year-old male increased by 170 percent.
<UL>
<LI>In 1992, New Jersey passed guaranteed issue and a phase-in
to pure community rating by 1997.  This summer, more than 100,000
New Jersey also mandates that anyone who wants insurance must
buy one of five state-designated plans.
<LI>In Vermont, The Burlington Free Press is calling for the repeal
of health-care reform enacted several years ago, which included
community rating and guaranteed issue, and prohibited individual
insurers from charging healthy people low rates.
</UL>


<P>
Now, these 7,500 healthy Vermonters who thought they were part
of a safety net are getting hit with a 60 percent rate increase
from Blue Cross.  The result?  They can't afford their health-care
plans so they are hoping state taxpayers will pick up the tab.
<P>
Not all groups appear to be sold on the negative consequences
of such mandates.  The National Association of Insurance Commissioners,
for example, is crafting model state legislation that advances
the implementation of these failed reforms.  According to a recent
draft of the legislation (called the Small Employer and Individual
Health Insurance Availability Act), community rating and guaranteed
issue will be a part of the model act that is supposed to provide
guidance to states.
<P>
Interestingly, the NAIC's draft bill notes that &quot;this act
is not intended to provide a comprehensive solution to the problem
of affordability of health care or health insurance.&quot;
<P>
In the state of Washington, the legislature repealed an entire
health-care reform act due to the market perversions and impact
it had on state policy holders and taxpayers.
<P>
In other states, market-based reforms such as medical savings
accounts - which allow smaller enterprises to pool for insurance
purchases - and state risk pools to capture those who may be uninsured
are the wave of the future.  To date, 30 states have adopted state
risk pools, and 15 have enacted medical savings account legislation.
<P>
Even Washington, D.C., has gotten the message - no heavy-handed
reform bills coming from this Congress.  The primary reform measures
coming from the new Congress are medical savings accounts, purchasing
pools for small employers and the self-employed, the move toward
tax equity for entrepreneurs to allow laid-off employees to keep
their insurance.
<P>
Elected officials at both the state and national level appear
to be listening to their constituents and those who favor market-based
solutions in health-care reform.  But one wonders, will the NAIC
actually have an audience when it comes to presenting its solutions
- after it's finalized the model bill for making health-care more
&quot;available?&quot;

<CENTER><B>Michela Alioto (D-CA-1)<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
Meet Michela Alioto (D), one of the heirs to the
AFL-CIO's
$35 million "windfall"
from American workers that union bosses are using in their effort
to buy back Congress.  With the help of this special "education
fund",
Alioto (D) is mounting a serious challenge to Representative Frank
Riggs (R), who currently represents California's
first congressional district.
<P>
According to FEC reports filed between January and
June, 1996, Alioto (D) has received $74,125.00 in campaign contributions
from organized labor.  Describing the diversity of her contributor
base, Alioto said,<i> "To
be perfectly honest, we had labor and that was it."</i>
 She further candidly asserted that she is "very
proud of that, and <U>will never forget it</u>."
<P>
Should she unseat Riggs (R) on November 5, these
will no doubt be words for her to live by in the 105th Congress.
<BR>
<P>
<a name="two"></a>
<CENTER><B>Contempt for New York Union<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
The New York Sheet Metal Workers Local 28 has tried
for 25 years to blame its abysmal record of race discrimination
on everyone but itself.  The U.S. Supreme Court refused to accept
any more excuses and let stand a contempt of court citation. 
The union once again is ordered to stop discriminating against
minorities and to satisfy a court decree of reaching a goal of
29.23% minority membership.
<P>
The case stems from a suit filed by the federal government
in 1971 charging that the union discriminated against blacks and
Hispanics seeking union membership.  Minorities made up only 3
percent of the membership by 1974.  After constant legal challenges,
the union is currently subject to the order to raise minority
membership.
<P>
Over the past quarter century, the union has dragged
its feet and already been cited for contempt.  It has sought to
blame employers, the courts and the law itself for its failure
to provide equal opportunity.
<P>
As the national union bosses seek to portray the
labor movement as the champion of workers, once again we see that
that their own house is not in order. <BR>
<P>
<a name="three"></a>
<CENTER><I><B>In Style for 1996:</B></I></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>The Union Yes-Man<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
For years unions have spent heavily on public relations
to promote its slogan, "Union
Yes."
 This year the AFL-CIO is sinking up to $500,000,000 dollars into
its effort to buy back control of government.
<P>
In addition to buying up television time and traveling
door-to-door, the unions have unveiled a fresh crop of political
candidates who are taking the union money in their run for public
office.
<P>
Inside-the-beltway political pundits are calling
these challengers "Union
Yes-Men."
<P>
How does a Union Yes-Man stand out from the rest
of the pack.  The following "test"
is provided by an avid reader of <I>Labor Watch</I>:<BR>
<P>
If your army of campaign "volunteers"
all have Washington D.C. license plates, you might be a Union
Yes-Man.
<P>
If the phrase, "Pardon me," is a campaign payback, not a Miss Manners' nicety, you might be a Union Yes-Man.
<P>
If you plan to dress up as a "ghost
employee"
for Halloween, you might be a Union Yes-Man.<BR>
<P>
<a name="four"></a>
<CENTER><B>No, We Mean Other Oppressive Employers!<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
When it comes to watching out for the rights of workers,
AFL-CIO has a glaring blind spot-
its own employees!  The labor federation is under severe criticism
for forcing its "Union
Summer"
workers to put in excessive <U>unpaid</U> overtime.
<P>
In a complaint to the Department of Labor, Rep. Cass
Ballenger (R-NC) demanded an investigation into reports that participants
were given a weekly stipend of $210 and free housing and required
to put in 12-hour days.  The Workforce Protections subcommittee
chairman calculated that at least one participant apparently receive
an hourly wage of $2.76, without any overtime premium,
when the minimum wage was $4.25 an hour.
<P>
A response from the Labor Department may come soon,
but the union reaction to the charges was immediate.  
<P>
Deborah Dugan of the AFL-CIO in response to the charges
remarked, "We
feel very confident that we complied with the relevant laws,"
<I>The Washington Times</I> reported.
<P>
Why do union leaders always appear so defensive when
the Labor Department goes after them?<BR>

</B></CENTER>
<P>
Michael Petyo, a Republican challenger running against incumbent
Rep. Peter Visclosky in Indiana, is proud of his union family
heritage.  His letterhead boldly states his credentials,
"Businessman,Union Man, Veteran."
<P>
But labor leaders have turned on Petyo, by distributing his positions
on issues that he says he was never contacted about.  In fact,
Petyo supports 7 of the 8 positions that the AFL-CIO claims he
opposes in their "voter"
guide.
<P>
Here is the text of a letter sent to Jerry T. Payne, Secretary
Treasury of the Committee on Political Education, Indiana AFL-CIO:
<BR>

<P>
<I>Per our conversation by phone this morning, please understand
that I am VERY disappointed that my brothers in the AFL-CIO would
choose to do something as irresponsible as to report my positions
on union issues incorrectly.  Saying you assumed negative responses
because I failed to send in a survey I never got is beyond insulting.
 This is particularly true in light of your "voter"
guide claim that "all
information contained [was] obtained from press releases, surveys,
and questionnaires."
 I consider this to be a small time, underhanded way to operate.
 I expect and demand more from my union brothers and especially
from my leadership.</I>
<P>
<I>As I said, my campaign received no survey.  Further, if I had,
I certainly would have responded quite differently from the false
information being sent out by the AFL-CIO about me.  I am a member
of Carpenter's Local
1005 out of Hobart, Indiana.  My son is also a member of 1005.
 My wife is a member of Foodserver's
Local 1 out of Chicago, Illinois.  My family is a union family.
 You have attacked something that I have worked to instill in
my family.</I>
<P>
<I>I can not begin to try to understand nor explain to my family,
my friends, my neighbors, my fellow workers, and others why my
own union brothers and sisters would want to publish such outright
lies about me.  I am at a loss with what to do or say.  Your actions
in printing <B>Stand Up: For Indiana's
Working Families: AFL-CIO Voter Guide by Issues</B> were absolutely
wrong.</I>
<P>
<I>John Sweeney said to me as a union man that weneed to support
our own.  As a union man, I agreed with him and decided it was
time to get one of our own elected.  As a union man, I feel my
working brothers and sisters should know the truth about both
me and my campaign.  I believe that this entire affair is a contrived
inaccuracy.</I>
<P>
<I>I expect to see from my union leadership a public retraction
of these statements.  I look forward to them showing their support
for one of their own.</I>
<P>
<I>God Bless You and thank you in advance for your help in correcting
this injustice.<BR>
</I>
<P>
In a letter to Petyo, the AFL-CIO representative Payne writes:
<BR>

<P>
<I>Our record indicated, prior to receiving your fax today, that
you had NOT responded in writing to our questionnaire.  Therefore
we assumed you were opposed to the issues or else you simply did
not wish to have a written record of where you stand on the issues.
<BR>
</I>
<P>
If Petyo was a Democrat, we have to assume that they would of,
in fact, supported one of their own.<BR>

<CENTER><B>Hotel Strike Keeps Going and Going and </B></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><B>Going and . . .<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
Striking workers continue to picket at the Frontier Hotel in Las
Vegas, Nevada in what is currently the longest strike in the United
States. Over 500 workers walked off the job on September 21, 1991
because the hotel was seeking a contract with terms different
from the pact agreed to by other Strip hotels.
<P>
AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer, Richard Trumka, during his annual
visit to the strike, said that the strikers "are
teaching workers of America what solidarity is all about."
 Trumka also boasts that during the strike, not one striker has
crossed the picket line and that they have maintained pickets
24 hours a day.  
<P>
Striker Stats: Strikers have been receiving three meals a day
(free); 101 babies have been born to strikers, and union leaders
have encouraged other union members to participate in the strike
when visiting Las Vegas.
<P>
Anyone care to wager an end date to this strike?<BR>

<CENTER><B>LIUNA PAC Money Flows Freely to Democrats<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
Labor union leaders are "betting
the House" that Democrats
take control of Congress next year.  Their $35 million-dollar
ad campaign is augmented by over $40 million in PAC contributions.
<P>
  The Laborers International Union of North America (LIUNA) 
(the topic of many <I>Labor Watch </I>articles dealing with its
ties to organized crime and its relationship to the White House)
is feeding the campaign
coiffeurs of 209 Democrats through its PAC, the Laborers Political
League.  To date, $750,000 of the PAC money has made its way to
Democrat incumbents and challengers to vulnerable Republicans
this election cycle.
<P>
Countless LIUNA officials have been convicted of state and federal
offenses during the past 20 years.  And, LIUNA has been described
as a "union with clear
ties to organized crime"
by New York's Organized
Crime Task Force and the President's
Commission on Organized Crime.  
<P>
In 1994, a Justice Department report stated that: "LIUNA
has been infiltrated at all levels by corrupt individuals and
organized crime figures who have exploited their control and influence
over the union for personal gain and to the detriment of the union.
 LIUNA union officers and employees at all levels, including the
general presidency, have been chosen, subject to the approval
of, and have been controlled by, various members and associates
of organized crime."
<P>
Recently, questions have been posed by the media and legal experts
regarding Arthur Coia's
(head of LIUNA) friendship with President Clinton and the First
Lady, and whether the Justice Department is giving LIUNA favorable
treatment because of Coia's
personal ties to the Clintons.
<P>
The legal cloud over LIUNA has not stopped  Democrats from taking
LPL's money.  
<P>
In the House, Laborers Political League money is being doled out
to key Democrats in the leadership, and those ranking members
who would chair committees if the Democrats take control of Congress
next year.  
<P>
Here is a list of those Democrats and the amount of money recieved
(so far) from the Laborers Political League in 1996:<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Democrat  Position  Laborers $ $ $ $</FONT></B>
<P>
Dick Gephardt Minority Leader $9,000
<P>
David Bonior  Minority Whip $10,000
<P>
Martin Frost  DCCC Chairman $10,000
<P>
David Obey  Appropriations $6,500
<P>
Martin Sabo  Budget  $3,000
<P>
John Dingell  Commerce  $5,000
<P>
Bill Clay  Economic and Educational Opportunities $10,000
<P>
Lee Hamilton  International Relations $4,000
<P>
John Conyers  Judiciary  $5,000
<P>
Joe Moakley  Rules   $9,000
<P>
John LaFalce  Small Business $2,000
<P>
James Oberstar Transportation $7,000
<P>
Charlie Rangel Ways and Means $7,000 <BR>

<P>
What type of Return of Investment will LIUNA get for its generosity?
 Good question.  Too bad the media isn't
paying attention.

<B>Christmas in October<BR>
</B>
<P>
October 3, 1996 will go down in the history books as a red letter day in the struggle to break free of the shackles of reactionary union leaders and their congressional lackeys.  On this day, the Senate broke the Kennedy fillibuster over a labor provision in the transportation bill, and the Labor Department erased its illicit and illegal striker replacement regulations.
<P>
The Kennedy fillibuster was designed to prevent a technical correction which would have clarified that Federal Express has always been, and shall continue to be, covered by the Railway Labor Act (RLA).  Under the RLA, unions must organize all workers of a company in a nationwide system.  Union organizers have been trying to ignore that law and organize smaller portions of FedEx under the rival National Labor Relations Act.
<P>
The National Labor Relations Board has been considering this issue for almost five years.  Now that the AFL-CIO controls a majority of the votes on the Board, including the vote of former Kennedy staffer Sarah M. Fox, the agency was poised to reverse the law to favor the unions.
<P>
Also, on October 3, the Labor Department officially nullified regulations implementing the striker replacement executive order.  That order was blocked by a federal appeals court as an unlawful power grab by the President.
<P>
While the nullification of the rules closes the official book on this sordid story of special interest pandering, the theme remains alive in the Democrat platform for 1996.  That document states:  "We support the President's actions to stop the government from procuring goods and services from companies that [hire permanent replacements]."  The action, though deemed illegal by the courts, is still supported by the President and his side-kicks John Sweeney, Dick Gephardt, and Tom Daschle.
<P>
<a name="two"></a>
<B>Psst, the Law is Still the Law<BR>
</B>
<P>
Leave the Sweeney/Clinton Labor Board out of the case and the law remains the law.  In other words, a federal appeals court recently ruled that arbitrators still do not have the power to stick union contracts onto nonunion employers.
<P>
In the case involving Zcon Builders in California, the court upheld  long-standing precedent recognizing the separateness of different subsidiaries.  The union claimed that a nonunion firm was the alter ego of a unionized company, and sought to enforce its collective bargaining agreement against both.  An arbitrator issued an award of back pay against both firms, thus assuming power to act against the company that never signed the contract.  The appeals court rejected this power grab, ruling the arbitrator overstepped his authority.
<P>
The case is significant as a reaffirmation of the legitimate practice of double breasting, where businesses operate both union and nonunion subsidiaries.  It is symbolic because it comes only four months after the Sweeny/Clinton Labor Board issued its most pro-union decision to date on this or any other topic.  In the Board's Manganaro decision, reported in Labor Watch (5/17/96), the union activists on the Board ignored past precedent and ruled that unions can force contracts on nonunion subsidiaries.  The decision opened the door for imposing union membership and dues onto nonunion workers without a secret ballot election.
<P>
The good news is that the AFL-CIO policy machine has not yet annexed the federal courts.  Whether the NLRB can return to  neutral ground remains to be seen.
<P>
<a name="three"></a>
<B>Corporate Campaign Against Bridgestone/Firestone Hits the Information Superhighway<BR>
</B>
<P>
The United Steel Workers have expanded the venue of their corporate campaign against Bridgestone/Firestone from the traditional picket activities at subsidiary companies to the Internet.  The union's new world wide web site asks "cyber protesters" to send pro-union messages to the company.
<P>
Several municipal bodies, retailers and other companies have boycotted products and services of Bridgestone/Firestone.  Saturn reportedly is replacing Firestone Tires with another brand on all new cars at customers' request.
<P>
Despite the two year strike and corporate campaign, Bridgestone officials report that the company has maintained record sales and round the clock operations.  Late last month, Bridgestone/Firestone sent recall notices to all remaining strking workers.
<P>
<a name="four"></a>
<B>Labor Unions Top List of OSHA Training Grant Recipients<BR>
</B>
<P>
Labor unions have never shied away from the U.S. government money tree, and it seems that green-backs are ripe for the picking from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).  OSHA will disburse over $2 million in training grants to 26 non-profit groups to fund training  and research programs, with emphasis on ergonomics, back injury prevention, and safety and health programs.
<P>
Labor unions can expect to receive over one million dollars of the grant money.

<B>Rank-and-File vs. Sweeney<BR>
</B>
<P>
<dd>On September 1, 1996, AFL-CIO President John
Sweeney wrote an op-ed in <I>The Washington Times</I> defending
the union's use of members dues to subsidize political activities.
 On September 10, a union member responded.  Here is a brief excerpt
from the letter:
<P>
<i>As a member of an AFL-CIO-affiliated union,
I found John Sweeney's Commentary article (&quot;Debating the
AFL-CIO's Campaign Role:  Resource Allocation,&quot;- Sep. 1)
misleading and untruthful.</I>
<P>
<dd>Mr. Sweeney errs by stating that &quot;no
individual is ever forced to pay the pennies it costs each month
for his or her union's political activities.&quot;  While the
assessed amount for the &quot;grass-roots action and advertising
in the media&quot; he speaks of are small, not all unions are
complying with federal law prohibiting the use of dues for political
purposes.  I demanded a refund from the national president of
my union;  he refused to even consider this, claiming it would
jeopardize the union's standing with the AFL-CIO.  Thus, Mr. Sweeney's
claim is a lie.  While the individual amount of money may be small,
the principle being violated is not. 
<P>
<dd>...Four years of Clinton/Gore has been too
much.  This union member will be voting for Dole/Kemp this fall
because the Democrats have nothing to offer but higher taxes,
fear, misery and less freedom.  Mr. Sweeney is another power-grabbing
liberal, like the man he supports for the White House this fall.

<B>Clinton Administration Finally
Gives Up On Its Illegal Power Grab<BR>
</B>
<P>
<dd>As<I> Labor Watch</I> reader's recall, on
March 8, 1995, President Clinton issued an executive order to
bar the government from contracting with companies that fire and
permanently replace their striking workers.  The order applied
to contracts over $100,000.
<P>
<dd>The President was temporarily blocked by a
federal judge, and a federal appeals court unanimously overturned
his order on February 2, 1996.  The judge in the case said that
Clinton's actions violated federal labor law &quot;which guarantees
the right to hire permanent replacements.&quot;  They also called
the administration's arguments &quot;silly&quot; and &quot;far-fetched.&quot;
 The President's order would have covered federal government contracts
totaling $437 billion or 6.5% of GNP.
<P>
<dd>According to the senior counsel at the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce -- one of the parties that filed suit against
the order -- the decision &quot;means that when federal labor
law grants a business a certain right, the President can't just
come in and take it away by executive fiat.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<dd>The Administration decided this week not to
take the case to the Supreme Court, but Labor Secretary Robert
Reich loyally defended the President's action even though the
order was viewed as &quot;far-reaching&quot; by the courts.<BR>
<P>
<a name="three"></a>
<B>Mini Task Force on Health Care
Reform<BR>
</B>
<P>
<dd>All systems are &quot;GO&quot; for the Clinton
Administration's push for guaranteed (government-run) universal
health care coverage.  The President has tapped Secretaries Robert
B. Reich of Labor and Donna Shalala of Health &amp; Human Services
to lead the National Commission on Health Care Quality.  Membership
of the advisory panel is expected to include labor union leaders
and representatives from the health, insurance and &quot;business&quot;
communities.  The Commission, among other things, will &quot;study
the need for consumer protections, guarantee quality of care,
and assure access to health care services.&quot;
<P>
<dd>Reich and Shalala replace the dynamic duo,
First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and guru Ira Magaziner, whose
failed top-to-bottom health care reform is credited as a key reason
why Democrats where voted out of Congress in 1994.  With labor
unions and the left elated with the new commission, it is projected
that the Reich-Shalala proposals will be reminiscent of the old
Clinton-health care plan.  Even with the passage of Kennedy-Kassebaum,
President Clinton's &quot;business agenda&quot; in his second
term, if reelected ,will focus heavily on health care reform.
<P>
Is it too early to dust off Harry and Louise?
<BR>
<P>
<a name="four"></a>
<B>Chicken Little<BR>
</B>
<P>
<dd>Secretary of Labor Robert B. Reich's nationwide
sweatshop sweep recently took him to DeCoster Egg Farm in Turner,
Maine.  With a media cadre and state Democrat legislators in tow,
the U.S. Department of Labor's investigation into housing and
labor violations resulted in a $3.6 million fine against the company.
<P>
<dd>DeCoster Egg Farms is no small-time closet
operations.  It is the town's biggest taxpayer and employer, with
360 employees.  According to a city official, &quot;The town's
own inspectors had long insured that the egg farm kept up to local
codes.&quot; 
<P>
<dd> However, DeCoster agreed to comply with the
DOL findings, including purchasing new housing for workers.  Unfortunately,
the story does not end here.  The Reich investigation-turned-media
expos&eacute; damaged company sales and tarnished the company's
image - despite quick compliance.
<P>
<dd>The Administration's &quot;reinvention initiatives&quot;
calling for partnerships between government and business to correct
labor violations have proven to be empty promises.  We can expect
the 1996 presidential campaign to showcase  Reich as he conducts
more inappropriate media-laden crackdowns to make the news - 
not a difference -  on companies that supposedly violate labor
laws<BR>

<B>Unhatched and Mobilized - </B>
<br>
<B>Federal Employees Gear Up for '96<BR>
</B>
<P>
<dd>With more than 3 million federal employees now &quot;unhatched&quot;
to fully participate in partisan political activities if they
want to, President Clinton has unleashed a tremendous political
force than can help him win this November with the liberalization
of the Hatch Act in 1993.  A diversity of interests have long
opposed overhauling the 1939 Hatch Act - a bill that bars federal
workers from participating in various political activities, and
in theory, protects them from political coercion.
<P>
<dd>The main assertion has been that liberalizing the Act would give
more power to unions, and thus Democrats.  Federal union members
who can now attend Chicago as delegates to the Democrat National
Convention have not been shy about sharing what they plan to do
with their new found freedom.  As quoted in <I>The</I> <I>Washington
Post</I> on August 26, Myke Reed of the American Postal Workers
Union (APWU) says, &quot;Surveys showed that 40% of union households
voted Republican in 1994...It's not going to happen again.&quot;
<P>
<dd>The National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU) also plans to flex
its partisan muscle.  The NTEU is targeting 39 congressional seats
- those who are &quot;anti-federal employee lawmakers.  The President
of the NTEU is quoted as saying that President Clinton's changes
in the law allow them to &quot;have a real opportunity this time
to influence the outcome of a number of elections.&quot;<BR>
<P>
<a name="two"></a>
<B>Mean-Extreme Republicans are at it Again...First
They're Cutting Medicare, Now They're Raiding Pensions<BR>
</B>
<P>
<dd>The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) is encouraging
Democratic candidates to say that Republicans in Congress &quot;voted
to allow corporate raids of employee pension funds&quot; and &quot;voted
to allow companies to take the money without informing their employees
or retirees.&quot;
<P>
<dd>According a survey conducted by Stan Greenberg (oh great health
care pollster for President Clinton), the pension message tested
by him is the strongest campaign weapon yet.  A memo from the
DCCC states, &quot;The pension raids are the strongest reason
to vote against a GOP Member of Congress this fall.&quot;  The
second strongest message is &quot;Cutting medicare to pay for
tax cuts for the wealthy.&quot;  
<P>
<dd>Both claims are false, but truth has nothing to do with labor
leaders wanting a Democrat Congress next  year.  The AFL-CIO is
running ads pushing both messages.
<P>
<dd>In the DCCC memo, there is no mention of the specific &quot;pension
raid&quot; legislation to back up their claims for candidates.
 For the record, the Republican Reconciliation Bill eased the
tax burden for businesses which chose to use excess pension funds
above 125% of current pension liability for other business/economic
activity.  This minor adjustment to the tax law is &quot;the big
pension raid&quot; labor unions refer to in their rhetoric, and
in their multi-million dollar ad campaigns.  The change in law
simply encourages businesses to reinvest excess pension funds
into the company to create more opportunities for their workers.
<BR>
<P>
<a name="three"></a>
<B>Media Reality Check -</B>
<B> Union Dominance of the Democrat Party<BR>
</B>
<P>
<dd>Most news surveys have found that union members made up approximately
34% of delegates to the Democrat convention - a figure kindly
passed over as trivial matter.  
<P>
<dd>According to the Media Research Center in its daily coverage of
media reporting on the convention, the media has reported that
union members dominate the delegate count in Chicago, but they
have failed to raise questions concerning &quot;who controls the
party.&quot;   The Center's <I>Media Reality Check '96</I> reports,
&quot;Only 21% of GOP delegates said they were part of the religious
right, but in San Diego, CBS worried about their having too much
influence.  On Sunday, August 11, Face the Nation guest gave five
ominous questions.&quot;  But television guests in Chicago have
not been asked similar questions about control of the Democrat
party relative to union influence. 
<P>
<dd> Here are the number of delegates that the major unions sent to
Chicago:  the AFL-CIO sent 811 delegates to the Democrat National
Convention; National Education Association sent over 400 delegates;
and the American Federation of Teachers sent 150 delegates.<BR>
<P>
<a name="four"></a>
<B>Operation Liberty Bell<BR>
</B>
<P>
<dd>The National Right to Work Committee mounted a challenge to organized
labor's $35 million campaign against Republican members of Congress
up for re-election by kicking off a national campaign called &quot;Operation
Liberty Bell.&quot; 
<P>
<dd> The National Right to Work Committee campaign will inform workers
of their <U>Beck </U>right to a refund of the portion of their
union dues that is used for purposes other than collective bargaining
- for example, political campaigns and lobbying activities.
<P>
<dd>An April 1996 Frank Luntz and Associates poll found that 62% of
union members opposed the use of their dues for negative political
advertising against Republicans; 59% would ask for a refund of
their dues; and 78% did not know they could file a form to stop
payment of their dues for political purposes.

<b>Education Lobby Shifts Political Strategy --<br>
NEA Has New Presence at GOP Convention</b>
<p>
<dd>While the bulk of the education lobby's PAC money is dedicated to electing Democrats, the National Education Association ( NEA) claims that the '94 elections were a "wake-up call" that required their presence at the GOP convention in San Diego.
<p>
<dd>According to a new poll of NEA members, the union found that its rank-and-file is evenly split in its political affiliation -- one-third are Republicans, one-third are Democrats, and one-third are Independents. The poll also reports that union members feel that the NEA is too partisan.
<p>
<dd>Accordingly, the NEA held several events with Republicans this week at the Convention -- in order to build bridges.
<p>
<dd>A recent report showed that close to 99% of the NEA's political action funds are directed to Democrats, but nonetheless, the education lobby claims that they will not try to elect Democrats "but a pro-education majority."
<p>
<dd>There 34 NEA delegates to the GOP convention and the Republican Mainstream Coalition (liberal Republicans) hosted an event to discuss how to avoid "cuts in education." Republican members of Congress speaking at the program included Senator James Jeffords, and Representatives Sherwood Boehlert and Jim Leach.
<p>
<dd>NEA president-elect Bob Chase says he came to San Diego in search of "common ground" -- but GOP insiders say the teacher's lobby can first begin with common sense, by ending their political attacks on Republicans.
<p>
<a name="reversal"></a>
<b>A Reversal of Fortune</b>
<p>
<dd>The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) was forced to practice-what-it-preaches, in a reverse discrimination suit against the Commission from an EEOC employee. A federal district court recently sided with the plaintiff, a white-male attorney for the EEOC, who charged that he was denied promotions 10 times between 1984-1992.
<p>
<dd>The EEOC and Justice Department continue to remain tight-lipped on the case. The plaintiff received outstanding job performance appraisals in addition to receiving certification from a management training course during his long tenure at the Commission.

<dd>A public sector union must accommodate the religious beliefs of a Roman Catholic worker who opposes union stances on social issues, a U.S. District Court judge ruled earlier this month. The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) must allow the union member to donate to charity, an amount equal to his mandatory union fees, so that he does not inadvertently contribute to causes he objects to on moral or religious grounds.
<p>
<dd>The worker objected to positions taken by the union on abortion and the death penalty, and also to "supporting an organization (AFSCME) that champion theses issues," according to the judge. Not only was the union ordered to allow the worker to pay an amount equal to his union fees to an "agreed upon" charitable organization, but it was ordered to refund his fees from 1991.

<b>Time to Overhaul the NLRB</b>
<p>
<dd>The Small Business Survival (SBS) Foundation released a new report documenting the bias of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and its interpretation of labor law. The report also outlines reform measures to move both labor law and the NLRB into the 21 st century.
<p>
<dd>According to the study entitled "Time to Overhaul Labor Law and the NLRB," the NLRB has taken judicial activism to the extreme  blatant political NLRB decisions have been consistently reversed by the courts who hear such cases. In addition, current NLRB Chairman William Gould has publicly stated his support or opposition to various pieces of legislation before Congress -- an act that is unprecedented for what is supposed to be an impartial arbritor of labor law.

<CENTER>Union Money Well Spent - New Board's Decision Advances
Labor Agenda<BR>
</CENTER>
</b>
<P>
A new Administrative Review Board set up by Labor Secretary Reich
in June, has expanded the Davis-Bacon Act to include more workers.
 The Davis-Bacon Act requires government-determined prevailing
wages be paid to workers on taxpayer-funded construction projects.
<P>
Specifically, the panel ruled that <U>suppliers</U> to a federally-funded
construction project also must pay Davis-Bacon wages to their
workers even though those workers do not work at the construction
site.  In reaching its decision, the Review Board had to reverse
the decision of an administrative law judge, and evade a 1994
federal circuit court ruling that exempted off-site work from
the payment of &quot;prevailing wages.&quot;  
<P>
In this case, Bechtel Constructors was getting the raw materials
it needed (for a federal construction project) from a quarry which
did not pay prevailing wages to the quarry workers.  They must
now pay these workers back wages in accordance with the Davis-Bacon
Act.
<P>
 One ironic feature of the case is that the defendant, Bechtel
Constructors, is a big beneficiary of the Davis-Bacon Act and
opposes its repeal.   Building trade unions, which have contributed
heavily to congressional Democrats and to the Clinton-Gore campaign,
have long sought this specific change in the way the Labor Department
administers the Davis-Bacon Act.<BR>
<P>
<a name="two"></a>
<CENTER><B>There He Goes Again<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) should have greater
powers to penalize employers, according to its chairman, William
B. Gould.  In the same breath, the chairman then criticized the
Republican Congress for seeking to &quot;emasculate&quot; his
agency by threatening budget cuts.
<P>
Chairman Gould has never missed an opportunity to express his
view that labor laws should be tilted in favor of unions.  His
speech this week to the California Labor Federation was no exception.
 But the union theme of Republican bashing was an added feature.
 Gould was effusive in his expression of thanks to California
labor bosses and Democrats for their efforts to protect his budget
and their agenda.
<P>
Most Board watchers agree that members should not criticize the
very law they are sworn to uphold.  Chairman Gould has consistently
flaunted this rule of professionalism and decorum.  His partisan
attacks also continue to destroy any pretext of impartiality.
<BR>
<P>

<CENTER><B>Non-Union Hotels and Democrats<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
A major Chicago labor union is upset that the Democrats have included
three nonunion hotels on the list of &quot;Democrat National Convention
Hotels&quot; for next month's big convention, <I>The</I> <I>Washington
Times</I> reports.  The Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees'
Chicago local had issued a list of nonunion establishments to
be shunned at the convention, and apparently Democrat planners
were compelled to ignore the union directive due to a shortage
of room space.
<P>
The Democratic National Convention Committee (DNCC) recently conferred
official convention status upon two Marriott Hotels and  Swisshotel.
 Marriott hotels have long been prominent on every union blacklist
because its staff refuses to unionize.
<P>
Although Bill Clinton and Al Gore plan to patronize a union hotel
for the convention, the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees
are stunned and appalled at the DNCC's decision.  <BR>
<P>
<a name="four"></a>
<CENTER><B>Bond Assails Clinton Veto of TEAM Act<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
As expected, President Clinton vetoed the Teamwork for Employment
and Management (TEAM) Act, and one U.S. Senator took Clinton's
action to task. 
<P>
 Senator Kit Bond, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business,
said that political pandering by the President on behalf of organized
labor played a major role in Clinton's decision to veto the TEAM
act.
<P>
Bond said an alarming pattern had developed.  &quot;President
Clinton's message to small business is 'get to the back of the
line; what labor wants, labor gets,' &quot; he said.
<P>
The TEAM Act amends the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB)
to allow employees and managers at nonunion companies to resolve
workplace issues such as scheduling, safety and health, and even
things like free coffee and company softball teams.  The legislation
would not allow employee teams to act as unions since they could
not engage in collective bargaining or act as exclusive representatives
of employees.
<P>
&quot;Opponents and even some misguided individuals in the news
media have claimed that the TEAM Act would allow 'company dominated
unions,' an assertion that is absolutely false,' &quot; said Senator
Bond.  
<P>
Once again, President Clinton has proven that the only &quot;team&quot;
he'll play on is organized labor.<BR>

<b>D.C. Labor Unions Derail Health Clinic for At-Risk Residents</b><br>

The July 1 edition of <i>The Washington Post</i> reports that labor unions representing District of Columbia health workers have halted efforts to open a health clinic for low-income residents of the North Capitol Street area of Washington, D.C.
<p>
After hearing many complaints about the shoddy treatment at her neighborhood clinic, community activist Alverta Munlyn decided that her neighbors would benefit if they, along with private and public organizations, came together to operate the city's nearby faltering clinic.  Munlyn also figured out that the new clinic would save the financially-strapped city $700,000 initially, and $1.3 million annually in subsequent years.
<p>
Munlyn convinced Providence Hospital to manage the clinic, Georgetown University to provide the doctors; public health officials to close the faltering clinic to subsidize hers; and finally, Munlyn persuaded Mayor Marion Barry to support her efforts.
<p>
But then the labor unions stepped in. Labor leaders -- fearful that labor infested hospitals would close if too many low-income residents chose private clinics -- believe that the city's poor should be cared for through a network of union-supported services. And now, city officials who once proclaimed the clinic as the perfect model for public-private partnership, have backed off from their earlier endorsements and offer weak reassurances that Munlyn's idea will be achieved.
<p>
D.C. Council member Jack Evans (D-Ward 2), outraged at the union's narrow position, says that labor unions should put their "interests aside for the better interest of the community."
<p>
But, the labor unions have not backed-off, putting their interests above the low-income residents in the District of Columbia. <i>Labor Watch</i> concludes that when labor leaders talk about universal health care for all, they only approve of such services when the jobs and money are fimnelled through them.
<p><br><b>
<a name="detroit">
If the Sweeney/Clinton Board Thinks It's Bad, It Must Be Awful
</b><br>
What is black and white, and walked all over? The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) settlement agreement with striking unions at the <i>Detroit News</i> and the <i>Detroit Free Press</i>.
<p>
Fed up with picket line misconduct, the NLRB is threatening Detroit's striking newspaper unions with a court injunction if the misconduct is not ended. Earlier in the labor dispute, the NLRB reached an "informal" settlement with the striking unions in which the "unions pledged not to block entrances to the newspaper's property, threaten or coerce replacement workers or employees who have crossed the picket lines, or engage in other strike misconduct." According to the Board's Detroit Regional Office, the agreement was breached "almost as the ink was drying." Unions however deny involvement in picket line misconduct, and say the violence is caused by the newspaper's private security.
<p>
The NLRB is currently seeking a "formal" settlement with the unions. If broken, the unions would be forced to end the misconduct and could force fines and other penalties.
<p><br><b>

<a name="love">
Labor-loving Republicans Snubbed by Labor
</b><br>
A two-term, labor-loving Republican will not receive the '96 endorsement of local labor leaders as he did in 1994.
<p>
But maybe someone forgot to tell Rep. Jack Quinn (R-NY) that he's not a Democrat. Nope -- Sorry! Buffalo Labor Relations Council President John Kaczorowski did in fact remind Quinn of his party status.
<p>
According to a July 15 article in <i>The Washington Times</i>, Kaczorowski said, "We even told him if he were a Democrat he wouldn't be having this problem." The Labor Council has endorsed Quinn's opponent -- a Democrat -- even though Quinn voted against NAFTA, against the TEAM Act, led the fight for the Family and Medical Leave Act, and authored the bill in the House to hike the minimum wage.
<p>
Quinn is appealing the local decision to the state AFL-CIO, but it looks bleak for a reversal. According to the state director, overturning the decision remains questionable. "Basically we don't feel that the labor agenda has progressed much this year," she said. The state AFL-CIO will announce their endorsements mid-September.
<p><br><b>
<a name="team">
Teamsters Will Be Teamsters
</b><br>
The Teamster's nominating convention at the Philadelphia Convention center was disrupted early on by shouts, jeers and rude chants by supporters of James Hoffa, the challenger to incumbent president Ron Carey. Carey's detractors claim that he has taken power from the locals, denied democratic process to reform-minded Teamsters, and drained the union's finances. At the convention, Carey refused to allow anyone to speak in opposition to his appointment of 120 unelected delegates. A voice vote on the issue was held, and Carey declared victory despite an apparent majonty of opposing votes. He ignored calls for a stand-up vote, and pandemonium ensued.
<p>
The booing, cheers, and catcalls drowned out the Pledge of Allegiance, Carey's speech, and those of everyone else who came to the podium with the exception of Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua's invocation. Sen. Arlen Specter (R-PA) was invited to speak, but both his introduction by Carey and the Senator's attempted remarks were overpowered by the anarchy. Afler delivering a scathing criticism of the Teamsters' behavior, Specter left in disgust. When asked whether the day's disruption had discredited the union, one official responded, "We're Teamsters, we're not choir boys."

 <center><h2>Right-to-Work Law Goes Down in Senate</h2></center><p>
Twenty-one states have right-to-work rules, but the Senate didn't come close to applying the law nationwide.  The law would bar union contracts from requiring nonmembers to pay dues as a condition of employment.<p>
Sounding like a limited government type-of-guy, Senator Ted Kennedy used the following rationale in leading the charge to kill the bill.  He said:<p>
We do not want the long arm of the federal government interfering with the legitimate interests of the states.<p>
<hr>
<a name="two"></a>
 <center><h2>Clinton: Not a TEAM Player</center></h2><p>

The Teamwork for Employees and Management (TEAM) Act was approved by the Senate (53 to 46) yesterday, with identical legislation overwhelmingly approved by the House last year.  <p>
But don't expect the President to sign the legislation even though he touts the concept of teamwork in the workplace. Organized labor deeply opposes the measure, and surely Clinton will veto it. <p> 
The TEAM Act amends the National Labor Relations Act to permit teams composed of employees and employers in nonunion settings to address mutual concerns in the workplace including scheduling, work assignments, health and safety issues, training, job descriptions and work rules.<p>
Clinton portrayed the TEAM Act as a vehicle for company-dominated unions to suppress workers and undermine employees rights to elect their own representatives.<p>
Many businesses have abandoned the workplace teams practice in fear that they may become the target of a National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) complaint, with the Board ruling against them as they have with several companies.<p>
The only TEAM Clinton is on these days is big labor.  Another election-year payoff appears to be in the works.<p>

<a name="three"></a>
<center><h2> Labor Chat</center></h2><p>

A chatroom on the Internet found some rank-and-file members disillusioned with their former union.
In this case, former members of the Wisconsin State Employees Union were lamenting about the AFSCME (American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees) judicial process.  Not happy with how their local union was operating, a union member thought AFSCME could help.  
According to the former union member:<p>
Anyone that's gone through AFSCME 'judicial process' knows it's essentially a political process designed to suppress union democracy.  That's true for the labor movement, and which is part of the reason there's only about a 16% national union membership.  Think about it: Who wants to pay dues to be suppressed?
Good question - and one which more union members are asking.<p>
 
 
  <hr>
<a name="four"></a>
 <center><h2>Another One Bites the Dust, Part III</center></h2><p>
Another union boss being ousted for corruption may sound like just another ho-hum story, but its big news for the 26,000 members of the Carpenters District Council in New York.<p>
The union took action against the local leadership after discovering well documented ties between several New York crime families and district council leaders, the preferential treatment of individuals tied to crime families at the expense of rank-and-file members, the use of union funds to pay the legal costs of defending council leaders against charges of corruption and the misuse of members benefit funds.<p>
One of the ousted leaders, Council President Frederick W. Devine, succeeded Paschall McGuinnes who is the current secretary-treasurer of the AFL-CIO Building and Construction Trades Department.  Devine, who was earning $360,000 a year, allowed preferential hiring for mob-tied workers at a major New York City construction project, and attempted to establish a labor-management cooperation fund that would have paid him an additional $175,000.<p>
<hr>
<a name="five"></a>
 <center><h2>An Inspector In Every Worksite</center></h2><p>

As reported in past editions of Labor Watch, the  Labor Party was founded in Cleveland, Ohio June 6 - 9.  Labor Watch promised to bring you more platform highlights that define the agenda of the new party.  In platform item #15, the Labor Party calls for an increase in the number of worksite inspections as well as the placement of in-house inspectors in all workplaces.  <p>
The platform reads:<p>
<ul>
<li><i>For starters, we need the right to act and to enforce any and all safety and health regulations.
We call for national legislation to train and deputize workers to be on the job inspectors in each and every workplace.<p>
<li>Such inspectors should be protected against corporate harassment and discrimination and should be able to do their job without fear of reprisal.<p>
<li>Such inspectors should have the power to shut down hazardous operations; enforce the right of every worker to refuse unsafe work;should have the power to investigate incidents to uncover their root cause; and to force the implementation of their findings.<p>
</i><ul><p>
In other words, the Labor Party is simply calling on business owners to allow the government and unions total management control of their operations.<p>

<B><i>The NLRB <FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">,</FONT> Unabashed
Advocate for Big Labor<BR>
</B></i>
<P>
Here is the ultimate proof that Organized Labor has received what
it paid for <FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">,</FONT> a National Labor
Relations Board (NLRB) that will satisfy the union agenda in every
instance.
<P>
Last week, NLRB Chairman Gould cast aside all sense of propriety,
decorum and lip service to impartiality by publicly denouncing
the TEAM Act, a bill to promote workplace cooperation.  Using
such rhetoric terming the bill &quot;classic Republican overkill,&quot;
 while renaming the measure the &quot;Employer Domination Act,&quot;
Gould left the arena of ideas and wholly joined the AFL-CIO propaganda
machine.
<P>
NLRB board members are judges.  The Labor Board is not supposed
to be the policy arm of the Clinton Administration, the Democratic
National Committee, nor the AFL-CIO. Gould has not only chosen
to embroil himself in a major legislative controversy, he's proven
himself an unabashed advocate of big labor rather than an impartial
judge of the law.
<P>
Just last month, as reported in <I>Labor Watch,</I> the Clinton
NLRB reversed long-standing law by giving unions the power to
shut down businesses in their effort to unionize separate companies.
 That case, involving a construction firm, established the new
rule of law that unions are free to strike, harass, and destroy
companies with which they have no bargaining relationship, so
long as the unions claim they are entitled to the type of work
in question; i.e., as part of a work preservation effort.
<P>
As Bill Gould showed last week, what John Sweeney and labor leaders
want from the NLRB, John Sweeney and the labor leaders get.<BR>

<P>
<a name="two"> </a>
<i><B>Proposed Legislation Strengthens Beck Decision

<P>
Workers will have a right to know how labor leaders spend their
union dues under new legislation introduced by House Republicans.
 The Worker Right To Know Act, H.R. 3580, strengthens provisions
under the <I>Beck</I> decision, which allows workers to obtain
a rebate of the portion of their dues not related to collective
bargaining.
<P>
Key provisions under the Worker Right to Know Act:
<P>
<FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">-</FONT>Require unions to get annual
written authorization from each worker before accepting or demanding
payment of money  not spent for collective bargaining and contract
administration; i.e., for political purposes;
<P>
<FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">-</FONT> Establish an independent
auditor to determine the percentage of dues money that is spent
on collective bargaining or noncollective bargaining;
<P>
<FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">-</FONT> Prohibit unions from forcing
workers to join and pay dues as a condition of employment;
<P>
<FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">-</FONT> Allow workers to participate
in a union without paying the portion of dues that goes towards
non-collective bargaining activities; and
<P>
<FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">-</FONT> Require unions to report
annually to the Department of Labor on how dues money is spent.
<P>
AFL-CIO President, John J. Sweeney labeled the new bill as &quot;a
calculated effort to chill our exercise of First Amendment rights
to inform members and the public about attacks this Congress is
leading against working families.&quot;
<P>
In reality, the legislation simply gives workers more protections
and say over how their union dues is spent.<BR>

<B><i>The Little Theater that Could<BR>
</B></i>
<P>
A small, nonprofit children's theater in New York City could boast
of standing-room-only if not for the fact that the crowds have
been union pickets.  The New Victory Theater on 42nd Street has
been the target of big Broadway unions who are trying to muscle
their way on stage.
<P>
New Victor uses nonunion workers, which helps keep ticket prices
down.  The theater's practice has not received warm reviews from
the labor unions, including ushers, makeup artists, and press
agents.  They fear that potential new neighbor, Disney, will follow
New Victory's lead when they move in down the block.  In the meantime,
the show will go on, union pickets and all.<BR>

<i><B>Taxpayer Outrage:  Union Officials' Salaries Paid with
</B></i>
<P><i>
<B>Medicare &amp; Social Security Trust Fund Dollars<BR>
</B></i>
<P>
And you thought labor unions were opposed to reforming  Social
Security and Medicare only because they cared about elderly Americans
being tossed onto the mean streets - hah!  The real reason has
recently emerged from scant media reports exposing blatant federal
subsidies to unions.
<P>
According to a June 6 editorial in the <I>Dallas Morning News</I>:
<P>
<I>The practice in question happens at the Social Security Administration.
 The federal agency pays the salaries of employees who work full
time or part time on labor union business.  It pays them from
the Social Security and Medicare trust funds, which most taxpayers
wrongly assume go exclusively to pay the retirements and health
care of U.S. workers.</I>
<P>
<I>It is all very legal.  Federal law requires it.  In fact, the
law also requires Social Security to provide office space and
administrative support services to its unions.</I>
<P>
According to the editorial, Social Security employees paid $4.8
million in union dues last year.  Still, taxpayers subsidize about
145 full-time and 1800 part-time union officials.  Under Clinton's
tenure (citing <I>Dallas Morning News </I>figures): <I>the amount
spent by Social Security on union business increased 83% to $11
million from 1993 to 1995...The number of employees who worked
full time as union representatives increased 81% during the same
period.</I>
<P>
Of course, the $4.8 million the unions collect in dues could easily
cover union officials' salaries <FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">,</FONT>
but why bother when the taxpayer is picking up the tab?
<P>
Recent studies show that Medicare will be bankrupt by 2001 and
Social Security by 2029.  And if unions keep pigging-out in their
share of trust fund money by beefing up both part time and full
time union staff, the trust funds will surely be empty sooner
than their anticipated bankruptcy in 2013.<BR>
<P>
<i><a name="two"></a>
<B>Irrational Labor Relations Board<BR>
</B></i>
<P>
Once again the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has been
slapped down by a federal appeals court for stacking the law against
employers.  The NLRB sought to force employers to hire union activists
who apply for positions that have  access to confidential and
sensitive labor relations information.
<P>
The Clinton NLRB required that an employer must produce objective
evidence showing that an applicant for a confidential job would
be disloyal to the employer.  Union membership or union activities
were not considered sufficient grounds.  The appeals court in
the Seventh Circuit rejected the NLRB position,  explaining that
the rule had &quot;no rational basis,&quot; that it &quot;is not
a <B>rational</B> construction of the Act,&quot; and &quot;requires
an employer to make an almost impossible showing.&quot;
<P>
The case was sent back to the Clinton appointees who no doubt
will make another stab at curtailing employer rights.<BR>
<P>
<i><a name="three"></a>
<B>Big Labor Getting On Democrat's Nerves <FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">,</FONT>
Columbus Mayor Seeks 'Management Rights'<BR>
</B></i>
<P>
The current Mayor of Columbus, Ohio <FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">,</FONT>
known throughout his six years in the state Senate as a liberal
Democrat <FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">,</FONT> has apparently
had it with Ohio's &quot;obstructionist&quot; collective bargaining
law.  Mayor Michael R. White detailed his frustrations with the
law in a May 20 letter to Senate President Stanley Aronoff, a
Republican from Cincinnati.
<P>
The letter, also sent to Governor George Voinovich, comes as White
has attempted to privatize some city operations, and improve city
services in an effort to save money.  According to the <I>Cleveland
Plain Dealer</I>, White asked the state legislature to change
the 13-year old law.  The letter      contends that the law permitting
government workers to organize &quot;has become a tool of unions&quot;
and has caused the &quot;emasculation of meaningful management
rights.&quot;  White also criticized the State Employment Relations
Board because the collective bargaining law had been distorted
by the board's rulings.
<P>
While conservatives are jubilant over their newfound ally in Mayor
White, union reaction has been bitter.  The head of the Cleveland
Police Patrolemen's Association said, &quot;The guy's got a lot
of nerve.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<i><a name="four"></a>
<B>A Kodak Moment We Wish We Had<BR>
</B></i>
<P>
Union summer &quot;Boot Camp&quot; unleashed the new generation
of union activists this week, and AFL-CIO President John Sweeney
took an active role in training sessions.
<P>
In Boston, Sweeney role-played a &quot;hostile employer&quot;
with the young activists in order to prepare them for the organizing
campaigns of hospital workers, city employees and laundry workers.
<BR>
<P>
<i><a name="five"></a>
<B>Union Rank-and-File vs. Labor Dictators<BR>
</B><i>
<P>
&quot;I've always been taught that unions are a brotherhood. 
To me this is more like the Mafia.  We are not supposed to come
out and use our own heads.  But this is not communism.  You don't
just vote for the party anymore.&quot;

<B>June 6, 1996<BR>
</B>
<P>
<a name="one"></a>
<i><B>An American Labor Party Will be Officially Launched
Early June<BR></i>
</B>
<P>
Some 1200 delegates representing local unions, central labor councils
and national unions will soon meet in Cleveland, Ohio to officially
announce the formation of an American labor party.  While the
name of the party has yet to be decided upon, its agenda and political
strategy has been well conceived.
<P>
The labor party will not endorse candidates (it believes the Democrat
Party has moved too far to the right) or run candidates for office
for several years, but it does intend to be a major political
force on issue advocacy and use the party to &quot;frame the nation's
political debate in terms of class <FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">,</FONT>
a broad working class against irresponsible, unacceptable corporate
power.&quot;  According to a May 27 article written for <I><B>In
These Times</B></I> (a twice-monthly left-leaning newspaper),
labor party advocates claim that its union supporters now number
over 1 million people <FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">,</FONT> or
6% of the labor movement.
<P>
According to the article, the labor party's statements of principle
include the following <FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">,</FONT> &quot;a
constitutional right to a job at a living wage; an income stability
fund to protect workers against job dislocation and downsizing
(see <I><B>Labor Watch</B></I> May 10, Issue 12 on New Jersey
proposal); free higher education for all; assurances of basic
social needs (single-payer health care, longer paid vacations,
affordable day care); and shorter work time.&quot;  The principles
also include union dominance in the workplace and &quot;just transition
to a non-polluting economic system and genuine equality of opportunity.&quot;
<P>
Interestingly, the party's chief organizers and advocates say
that they've made a major effort to &quot;minimize the influence
of small sectarian left groups.&quot;
<P>
Lastly, both labor party organizers and the AFL-CIO see their
goals as complimentary as the agenda of the new party is &quot;not
all that different&quot; from the unions.<BR>
<P>
<a name="two"></a>
<B><i>Going Postal<BR></i>
</B>
<P>
A new theory behind workplace violence was unveiled at the recent
meeting of the National Academy of Arbitrators <FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">,</FONT>
and all indications are that attendees may be in need of having
their heads examined.
<P>
Psychologists and unions now attribute incidents of employee violence
to failures in the workplace <FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">,</FONT>
<U>not</U> &quot;bad people,&quot; or &quot;crazy workers.&quot;
 For example, workplace factors that lead to violence can include
an employee reaction to unbearable workplace stress, such as downsizing
or the interaction with a person, or a situation.
<P>
While unions were quick to pin the blame of this serious issue
directly on human resource managers and employers, they were slow
to provide helpful solutions to the problem.  Unions denounced
the use of preventative measures, such as psychological profiles,
to help identify potentially violent employees.  According to
an official with the public-employee union American Federation
of State County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), lots of profiles
of violent employees &quot;sound like the profile of a good union
steward.&quot;<BR>
<P>
<a name="three"></a>
<i><B>Teaching Discord<BR>
</B></i>
<P>
At its 1995 convention, the National Education Association (NEA)
again defined itself as one of the leaders of the &quot;Big(ger)
Government Coalition.&quot;  Some of its resolutions include:
<P>
Endorsed single-payer Canadian-style health care;
<P>
Endorsed statehood for the District of Columbia;
<P>
Endorsed Gay and Lesbian History Month;
<P>
Denounced giving parents the right to choose their children's
schools;
<P>
Denounced home-schooling; and
<P>
Denounced a moment of silence in schools.
<P>
The NEA contributed $4.1 million in PAC funds to Democrats between
1993 and 1995.<BR>

<a name="four"></a><i>
<B> Stand for Clinton Rally Brings Out the Left<BR>
</B></i>
<P>
Unions weren't the only members of the radical fringe working
the crowd at last Saturday's Stand for Children rally.
<P>
Mike Golash stood near the rally stage hawking <U>Challenge</U>,
a publication of the Revolutionary Communist Progressive Labor
Party.  Its headline: &quot;CAPITALISM NO PLACE FOR KIDS.&quot;
<P>
According to a <I><B>Washington Post</B></I> report, Golash said,
&quot;What I hope to see is millions and millions of people warming
to the communist ideals <FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">,</FONT>
abolishing the wage system, ending racism and sexism, ending child
exploitation.  I see people realizing that we can take power through
revolution from the capitalists, and we can build a new society
based on production for equality, not production for profits.&quot;
<P>
The <I><B>Post</B></I> goes on to quote Golash as saying, &quot;Oh,
in the revolution, most of those people [conservatives] will be
destroyed.  They'll take up arms against us <FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">,</FONT>
there'll be a war, a civil war.  And they will be, you know, gotten
rid of, basically.&quot;<BR>
<P>
<a name="five"></a><i>
 <B>Minimum Wage Quote<BR>
</B></i>
<P>
&quot;I oppose not only an increase in the starting wage, but
a mandated starting wage period. It represents another death nail
in the coffin of the United States' free enterprise system.&quot;

<B><i>LIUNA Turns to Print Campaign to Clean-Up It's Image</i></B>
<P>
<B>Blames &quot;Right-Wingers&quot; for Its Trouble</B>
<P>
Feeling a little sensitive about being exposed for a rich history
of corruption and its ties to organized crime, the Laborers International
Union of North America (LIUNA) was compelled to purchase a full-page
ad in <I>The Washington Post</I> this week to &quot;answer its
critics.&quot;  Of course, LIUNA officials charged &quot;right-wing
extremists&quot; for their own internal troubles.
<P>
In a lengthy discourse (1849 words) the full-page ad reveals LIUNA's
own wrongdoings.  Boasting that LIUNA has implemented &quot;a
tough new Ethics and Disciplinary Code with zero tolerance for
any form of misconduct,&quot; the union is also proud of the fact
that it has hired, full-time, &quot;a former top official in the
Justice Department's Organized Crime Unit,&quot; and a former
top official in the investigative unit of the FBI.
<P>
The full-page ad, in essence, documents the massive irregularities
and corruption which has plagued the union for years.
<P>
The ad then proceeds to blame Republican leaders (&quot;Opponents
of Change&quot;) and &quot;Moronic Media Coverage&quot; for making
fraudulent charges against LIUNA.  These &quot;charges&quot; just
happen to be the details of the facts so competently described
in LIUNA's lengthy full-page ad.  While LIUNA wrote extensively
in the ad about their own problems and the corrective actions
they were taking to clean up the union, the only charges of &quot;Right-Wing
Mud-Throwing&quot; detailed in the ad were that House Speaker
Gingrich and Majority Leader Armey &quot;are dusting off all of
the old, discredited myths and buzzwords: big labor, out-of-touch,
union bosses.&quot;  LIUNA also takes aim at a recent <I>Reader's
Digest</I> article that chronicles the history of LIUNA and its
current leader, Arthur Coia.  LIUNA, in the ad, had nothing to
say about Coia's questionable ties to organized crime, and only
took aim at the details of the ongoing investigation of the union
by the federal government.
<P>
In effect, LIUNA took out the full-page ad to report that it has
been forced to take massive and unprecedented corrective measures
to clean up its operation, and is blaming &quot;right-wing extremists&quot;
for further reporting on and exposing its problems.  LIUNA boasts
of its clean-up efforts, but the question remains:  If LIUNA were
accountable to its members, and ran the union in an ethical and
legal manner, would the full-page ad been necessary in the first
place?

<B><i>Teachers Plan Fall Agenda</i></B>
<P>
<B>'96 Elections - Not the Classroom - Focus of Meeting</B>
<P>
The National Education Association (NEA) just completed a three-day
meeting with congressional contacts to devise a strategy for teachers'
unions in the fall elections.  The NEA and the American Federation
of Teachers (AFT) are the two main unions, with over three million
members.
<P>
According to <I>Investor's Business Daily</I>, a study of the
NEA's liberal legislative agenda shows that they and the American
Federation of Teachers are firmly established in the liberal tax-and-spend
pro-union Democrat camp.  In 1994, for example, Democrats got
99% of its PAC money, and 99% of the AFT's.  Passage of everything
on the NEA's spending &quot;wish list&quot; that year would have
cost taxpayers an extra $702 billion a year.  That shakes out
to $10,544 a year in additional taxes for a family of four.  In
addition, the NEA's plan would increase the size of government
by nearly 40%.  Of course, most of the issues on their list have
little or nothing to do with education.

<i><B>Rank-and-File vs. Sweeney:</i></B>
<P>
<B>AFL-CIO &quot;Officially&quot; Against MSAs Despite Popularity
Among Membership</B>
<P>
An official publication of the AFL-CIO, the <I>Trade Union Courier</I>,
is publicly on the record in support of Medical Savings Accounts
(MSAs), but the union's president, John Sweeney, has made it official
that the AFL-CIO will help Senator Ted Kennedy, and oppose MSAs
in health care reform legislation currently moving through Congress.
<P>
At the same time that America's &quot;Leading Labor Newspaper&quot;
is advocating that &quot;Congress should pass MSAs right now&quot;
(and as 50,000 United Mine Workers in West Virginia enjoy the
benefits of their negotiated MSAs), AFL-CIO chief Sweeney and
other union leaders who apparently don't heed the call of rank-and-file
members have stated the union's staunch opposition to MSAs.
<P>
The article entitled &quot;Who's Making Your Healthcare Choices?
MSAs let you do what is best for you,&quot; reveals that perhaps
labor leaders are not representing what's in the best interest
of the rank-and-file.  The article states:
<P>
<I>You've heard the MSA arguments; its rich versus poor, healthy
versus the sick, Democrats versus Republicans.  But who is speaking
for you?</I>
<P>
<I>Maybe no one; or worse maybe they are putting words in your
mouth.  You are not alone in thinking this is a good idea.  A
lot of rank and file members feel as you do.</I>
<P>
<I>. . . Let them (members of Congress) know that it should be
up to you to pick your own doctor, not some politician or HMO.</I>
<P>
<I>Let them know that you are wise enough to make the decisions
that are best for you.</I>
<P>
During the past several months, those favoring government control
of the health care system (like Ted Kennedy, and his friends on
the left like John Sweeney) have been fighting against the inclusion
of MSAs in health care reform.
<P>
The total disregard that Sweeney has displayed for his member's
views was recently uncovered in a poll conducted by Luntz Research
for Americans for a Balanced Budget.  The poll concluded that,
overwhelmingly, union members want a balanced budget, and tax
cuts (among other initiatives pursued by the Republican-led Congress)
which Sweeney is fighting <U>against</U> in Washington, and through
a multi-million dollar attack ad campaign funded by his members'
dues.  The rift over MSAs is just another example of Sweeney taking
liberties with his newfound power as chief of the AFL-CIO - putting
the name of the union behind efforts to kill legislation that
is contrary to the wishes and views of his membership, and aggressively
bankrolling media and political campaigns to reinforce Sweeney's
leftward views and desire to return the Congress back to Democrat
control.
<P>
The <I>Trade Union Courier</I> is published out of New York City.

<blockquote>
<i><B>Another Clinton Payback: NLRB Decision Allows Disruption of
Construction Markets</B></i>
<P>
Late last week, the Clinton National Labor Relations Board (NLRB)
issued its most blatantly pro-union decision yet.  The NLRB ruled
that construction unions can demand, strike over, and enforce
so-called &quot;anti-dual shop&quot; clauses.  This decision could
force contractors to shut down nonunion subsidiaries, or impose
union membership on nonunion workers without a secret ballot vote.
<P>
The case arose over a decade ago when the Painters union sought
to block open shop (nonunion) encroachment into what it considered
union markets.  The same union that for years fought paint rollers,
spray painters and other labor-saving devices for its workers,
has tried to prevent union contractors from setting up &quot;dual
shop&quot; organizations.
<P>
Dual shops allow construction firms to operate both union and
open shop companies in order to compete in distinct markets for
construction services.  For example, government work, because
of the Davis-Bacon prevailing wage law, has become a special market
niche for union firms.  Residential and most commercial construction
work across the country today is built nonunion.  In order to
compete for government and private work, a parent firm must operate
separate and distinct subsidiaries.
<P>
The NLRB ruled that &quot;anti-dual shop&quot; contract terms
will be considered legal <U>despite</U> the prohibitions in the
statute against imposing contract terms on neutral employers.
 The immediate result of the decision will be the immediate demand
by construction unions that contractors shut down open shop subsidiaries.
 While business spends the next several years fighting such crippling
demands, the courts must sort out the NLRB's shaky reasoning.
 The outcome of the Clinton NLRB's gift to unions will be higher
construction costs, major business disruptions and lost opportunities
for workers.
<P><a name="two"></a>
<i><B>No Comment from Clinton on </B></i>
<P>
<B>&quot;Corporate Responsibility&quot; Proposals</B>
<P>
At the White House Conference on Corporate Responsibility on May
16, President Clinton stressed good &quot;corporate citizenship&quot;
but was mute on his support for proposals advocated by Labor Secretary
Reich and leading Democrats that give special tax breaks and regulatory
favors to businesses that institute government-preferred employee
programs.
<P>
Honoring businesses (mostly large) that provide an array of benefits
for their employees, the President also announced the creation
of the &quot;Ron Brown Corporate Citizenship Award.&quot; 
<P>
&quot;Corporate Responsibility&quot; proposals have been pushed
by the labor unions, Reich and key supporters in the Congress,
but the business community has been less enthusiastic about having
to adopt cookie-cutter employee benefits programs in order to
receive special tax breaks.  With the higher fixed labor costs
associated with such programs (as in the non job-producing economics
of Europe), such rigid programs will make it more difficult for
employers to hire new employees.  Interestingly, small businesses
(the job creating engines of the U.S. economy) were not featured
at the White House event.  According to Clinton, all of the very
financially healthy corporations featured at the event &quot;proves
you can do the right thing and make money&quot;  - but for many
small businesses, the Clinton tax increase and proposed minimum
wage hike won't even give small start-ups a chance.
<P><a name="three"></a>
<i><B>Greed Crosses Union Lines</B></i>
<P>
Some members of the AFL-CIO's Building and Construction Trades
Department (BCTD) feel that the Laborer's International Union
of North American (LIUNA) is overreaching its jurisdictional boundaries
in its zeal to add new members to its declining rolls.
<P>
In a recent meeting of the fifteen BCTD union bosses, the Bricklayers'
chief John Joyce called for a censure on Arthur Coia's LIUNA &quot;for
its predatory objectives and behavior.&quot;  In LIUNA's &quot;expansionist
program,&quot; organizing methods allegedly have included cash
bribes and job offers to lure over representatives of other unions,
as well as negotiating to include the definition of other crafts
in their own collective bargaining agreements.  Joyce claims the
Plasterer's Union has had problems with LIUNA's encroachment on
their territory, and feels his bricklayers will be next.
<P>
Although members of the construction unions have for years bickered
and battled over jurisdictional issues, Joyce stated that the
censure was proposed because LIUNA &quot;has exhausted everyone's
patience.&quot;  But Joyce may have another motive in taking such
a hard line against LIUNA.  Coia supported the opponent of Joyce
ally, Robert Georgine, in the last BCTD presidential election.
<P>
Instead of censure, the BCTD gave LIUNA 30 days to resolve its
problems and make peace with the other unions to demonstrate solidarity.
<P><a name="four"></a>
<i><B>But Another Controversial Payback Struck Down Again by the
Courts</B></i>
<P>
Last week, the full court of appeals in Washington, D.C. refused
to cooperate in President Clinton's effort to tilt the balance
of power in labor's favor.  By a 9 to 2 vote the court rejected
the Administration's request for a rehearing of the decision to
invalidate the Clinton Striker Replacement Executive Order. 
<P>
That order would have prohibited federal contractors from hiring
permanent replacements during strikes and other labor disputes.
 If it had stood, a large group of employers would have been defenseless
against exorbitant demands by unions.  In February, however, a
panel of the D.C. Court of Appeals struck down the Executive Order
because it conflicted with clear, longstanding labor law principles.
<P>
The full court decision issued last week left no doubt that the
rule of law is superior to the President's wishes to pander to
unions. Terming the Administration's arguments &quot;far-fetched&quot;
and &quot;silly,&quot; the court refused to reconsider the earlier
decision of the three-judge panel.  The case in now likely to
go to the U.S. Supreme Court.
<P><a name="five"></a>
<i> <B>Starting Wage Fact</B></i>
<P>
Within one year, more than 60% of workers earning the minimum
wage will receive a raise of at least 20%.  This is as much as
the Clinton Administration's proposal but without the job loss.

<blockquote>
<i><B>Unions Follow Corporate America's Lead</B></i>
<P>
Consolidation.  Efficiency.  Layoffs.  These facts of corporate
life have come to the union movement.  The Laborers Union has
ordered the consolidation of 10 of its locals in New York City.
 Emulating the best in the corporate public relations field, the
union spokesman announced:  &quot;We realize that this will cost
some local union officers their jobs, but...members were paying
too much for the services they were receiving.&quot;
<P>
The union's restructuring was a matter of survival, but not from
the forces of competition like businesses face.  The District
Council of the union has been operating under a Trusteeship since
settlement of a Labor and Justice Department lawsuit in 1994 alleging
corruption.  The New York reorganization was required because
an investigation found that the structure was &quot;organizationally
and financially inefficient.&quot;  More damning, the union setup
provided &quot;unacceptable opportunities for organized crime
to corrupt the internal operation of the locals.&quot;
<P>
<a name="two"></a><i><B>Union Sued By Workers - Broke &quot;Job Security Vow&quot;</B></i>
<P>
According to an article from the Institute for Global Communications
(a labor internet news group), forty laid-off workers from the
Bath Iron Works Corp. are suing the Industrial Union of Marine
and Shipbuilding Workers of America.  The workers are suing on
the grounds that the union assured them of continuous employment
through 1997.
<P>
The union's lawyers claim that the workers should be suing the
company, not the union.  But according to one worker, who is now
on  welfare and trying to feed his family of four on $242 per
week, a union rep. was present at each worker interview stating
that &quot;everything would be ok.&quot;
<P>
The workers are seeking damages for lost wages, emotional distress,
and want to be reimbursed for union dues collected during their
employment.
<P><a name="three"></a>
<i><B>NLRB Advocacy Put on Hold...For Now</B></i>
<P>
The Congress passed, and the President has signed, a significant
provision curbing an abuse of power by the National Labor Relations
Board (NLRB).  As part of the 1996 spending bill enacted recently,
the Labor Board cannot spend any money to finalize its infamous
&quot;single location bargaining unit&quot; rule.
<P>
That rule has been roundly criticized by small business owners
as a blank check for union organizers to more easily organize
retail shops, restaurants and other businesses across the country.
<P>
According to a recent article by Bloomberg Business News, it is
estimated that a unionization effort at a small business would
cost the business as much as $100,000 to hire a lawyer and labor
negotiator.
<P>
The recently enacted ban remains in effect through this fiscal
year, September 30, and NLRB officials have said no final action
would be taken until Fall.
<P><a name="four"></a>
<i><B>New Jersey and You - Downsizing Together</B></i>
<P>
A New Jersey union is launching a grassroots campaign to support
proposed legislation that would financially punish businesses
that downsize.  &quot;The Job Destruction Penalty Act&quot; was
introduced in the New Jersey Assembly on May 2.   It would require
companies of 100 or more employees to give 2 months of severance
pay (for each year of service) to permanently laid-off workers.
 In addition, a fine of $4,000 per employee, per lay-off would
be levied against the company, and (in theory) would be given
 back to the community to help off-set the job and tax revenue
loss.  The New Jersey Industrial Union Council is leading the
grass- roots mobilization efforts.
<P><a name="five"></a>
<i><B>Clinton Asks Americans to Celebrate Labor's Rich Heritage</B></i>
<P>
On May 3, President Clinton proclaimed May 1996 &quot;Labor History
Month.&quot;  The President calls on all Americans to &quot;observe
this month with ceremonies, activities, and programs that encourage
reflection on the labor movement's heritage and its many contributions
to the creation and maintenance of a just America.&quot;
<P>
In his proclamation he extolled the virtues of unions and declared
that &quot;Each new generation of workers must embrace the activism
that has characterized labor's rich history...&quot;
<P>
Indeed, Americans will find a rich history, but unfortunately
the highlights of the labor movement are equally matched with
&quot;lowlights,&quot; including corruption, extortion and scandal.
 Of course, none of this is mentioned in the President's official
proclamation.
<P>
Could you imagine if &quot;each new generation&quot; embraced
AFL-CIO V.P.  Richard Trumka's  techniques?  <I>Labor Watch </I>readers
remember Trumka's kind remarks to those who don't see things his
way: &quot;...we'll knock you flat on your --.&quot;  
<P>
Traffice terrorism, hostile and unethical corporate campaigns,
violent strikes, bomb threats, and labor leader corruption are
other items looked over by the Clinton proclamation.
<P><a name="six"></a>
<i><B>White House to Sponsor Conference on</B></i>
<P>
<B>&quot;Corporate Responsibility&quot;</B>
<P>
On May 16, the White House will bring in its choice of the country's
&quot;best companies&quot; and sponsor a conference on good corporate
citizenship.  The CEOs that received the White House seal of approval
will breakfast with the President and participate in panel discussions
at Georgetown University.  Topics to be discussed will probably
include:  Family-Friendly Workplaces, Economic Security, Investment
in Employees, Partnership with Employees, and Safe &amp; Secure
Workplaces.
<P>
According to a copy of &quot;The President's Corporate Citizenship
Challenges&quot; distributed on March 23, ways that companies
can best help employees (in the above-mentioned areas) is by getting
them involved in the workplace, and by giving them a voice.  
<P>
Union organizing, as a way to help employees, is not mentioned.
 In fact, Clinton's &quot;Challenges&quot; sound very much like
the TEAM Act, legislation passed by the House and being pursued
by Sen Dole along with the minimum wage hike.  The unions strongly
oppose the TEAM Act.
<P><a name="seven"></a>
<i><B> Starting Wage Fact:</B></i>
<P>
<B>According to the National Governor's Association, a $1 increase
in the starting wage amounts to the largest unfunded mandate imposed
by the GOP-lead Congress</B>.

<P>
John, New York, NY</i>
</blockquote>
<P>
These were just two of the quotes that Luntz Research received
in a recent survey of union members to gauge rank-and-file sentiment
regarding big labor's heavy investment in congressional races.
 The unions are targeting Republican members in order to help
return the Congress to Democratic hands.  Over 1,000 union members
were surveyed for Americans for a Balanced Budget from April 23
- 28.
<P>
Key findings include:
<P>
<ul>
<li>By an overwhelming 84% to 9% margin, union members want to force
their leaders to explain what happens to their dues, where the
money is spent and why.
<P>
<li>Campaigns and politics <U>are</U> <U>not</U> the priorities of
the rank-and-file - only 4% said engaging in political election
activities were important.  Preserving jobs came out on top at
58%; increasing wages and benefits was second at 27%; and improving
the image of unions was third at 8%.
<P>
<li>Who is John Sweeney?  The rank-and-file membership would like
to know too.  Only 18% knew of him well enough to offer an opinion
of him.  82% had no opinion or knowledge of him.
<P>
<li>Rank-and-file members are not aware that they have a right to
get a refund for dues spent on political activities, despite union
leaders comments to the contrary.  Only 19% knew of this right.
 More strikingly, one-fourth of those belonging to a union for
two or more decades know about their right to a refund. Needless
to say, the union leadership has not publicized the issue with
its rank-and-file.
<P>
<li>Union members reaction was hostile to the fact that $35 million
dollars of their dues is being used to defeat Congressional Republicans.
 Overall, 41% are &quot;strongly opposed&quot; to the effort while
21% &quot;somewhat oppose&quot; it.  Of those supporting the campaign,
15% &quot;strongly support&quot; it, while 16% &quot;somewhat
support&quot; the effort.
</ul>
<P>
On specific issues, the rank-and-file membership appear to be
more in line with Republican-led initiatives. In fact, the union
leadership has pumped millions of dollars into lobbying and media
campaigns that run counter to the wishes of their membership.
<p>
For example:
<P>
<ul>
<li>By an 82% to 11% margin, union members support the Balanced Budget
Amendment.
<P>
<li>Welfare reform  that requires recipients to work is supported
by union members by 87% to 7%.
<P>
<li>The $500 tax credit pushed by the GOP is supported by 78% of those
surveyed.
</ul>
<P><a name="two"></a>
<i><B>Union Boss Lashes Out at Government Bureaucrats</B></i>
<P>
Sounding like an outraged small business owner, Bricklayers Union
boss John T. Joyce recently complained, &quot;If the [Labor Department]
is going to keep coming up with new technicalities and making
decisions on the flip of a coin, it is futile to try to do it
the right way.&quot;  The reason for Joyce's outburst: A DOL lawsuit
challenging his reelection for a fourth five-year term as international
union president.
<P>
The lawsuit, seeking to rerun the election, alleges widespread
use of union funds for payment of campaign personnel, improper
electioneering, and use of union equipment and resources by the
Joyce campaign.  Joyce defeated challenger Gerald Carlisle by
1,995 votes out of 88,235 votes cast.
<P>
&quot;This is precisely the senseless misuse of bureaucratic power
that erodes public confidence in the federal regulatory process,&quot;
Joyce laments.  &quot;In the case at hand, DOL understands neither
the law they administer nor the organizations they regulate.&quot;
<p>
At last - we agree on something.
<P><a name="three"></a>
<i><B>Kennedy and Labor Bosses Fighting Against Tax Free MSAs</B></i>
<P>
Labor leaders have joined the chorus of those condemning medical
savings accounts (MSAs).  In the weekly edition of <I>Work in
Progress</I>, an AFL-CIO publication, MSAs are described as &quot;controversial&quot;
calling them tax breaks for the healthy and wealthy.  
<P>
As confirmed by the Luntz survey, labor leaders seem to be out
of touch with their rank-and-file membership.  This certainly
proves to be the case with  MSAs.  Case in point: the United Mine
Workers of West Virginia bargained to get a MSA prototype in their
contracts.  According to the <I>Courier-Journal</I> of Louisville,
Kentucky, &quot;Each contract year, the company gives members
$1,000 for out-of-pocket health care costs; $1,000 is the deductible.
 Members not using the money for health care can keep it.&quot;
 Sounds like a MSA to <I>Labor Watch</I> staff.
<P>
Labor's &quot;hero&quot; Ted Kennedy is of course fighting against
MSAs - he prefers that the mine workers be taxed unfairly for
their health care benefits rather than giving them tax parity
with big corporations.
<P><a name="four"></a>
<i><B>Sweeney Youth Unleashed</B></i>
<P>
<i><B> &quot;Union Summer&quot; Campaign Begins June 1</B></i>
<P>
Political activism, union organizing and garden variety militancy
are the activities of AFL-CIO boss John Sweeney's summer internship
program.  Enlisting up to 1,000 young people from across the country,
Sweeney vows to put them to work &quot;planning, phone calling,
door knocking, organizing, and demonstrating.&quot;
<P>
At a press conference and barbecue on May 1, the union chief identified
the corporate campaign against the Detroit Newspapers as well
as Service Workers Union organizing drives as two of the projects
to which the interns will be assigned.  Sweeney also acknowledged
that the political activists will be put to work on grassroots
minimum wage fights at the state and local level, and agitating
against the California Civil Rights Institute.
<P>
Sweeney Youth will be deployed to cities across the United States
for three-week stints. The activists will receive training, free
housing, and a stipend of $210 per week.
<P>
(For a list of cities the interns will be sent to, contact SBS
Foundation at 202-785-0238.)

<i><B>AFL-CIO Grades It's Congressional Targets</B></i>
<P>
The  latest propoganda from an AFL-CIO mail campaign was given
to <I>Labor Watch</I> staff.  The mailing, a &quot;report card,&quot;
targeted 33 House members who received mostly &quot;Fs&quot; from
the union -  31 of the targets were Republicans, and 2 were Democrats.
 At first glance, the direct mail campaign appeared &quot;bi-partisan&quot;
- until it was discovered by <I>Labor Watch</I> staff that the
2 Democrats are leaving Congress.
<P><a name="two"></a>
<I><B>Another Payback</B></I><B>: Clinton's Latest Agent for Unions</B>
<P>
Add the Security &amp; Exchange Commission (SEC) to the list of
federal agencies dedicated to boosting the union agenda.  This
winter, the SEC ordered the Dupont Company to include in its proxy
statement, a proposal by its union to dedicate a seat on the board
of directors for a union member.
<P>
The company had opposed the election of a director that &quot;represents
a particular point of view or particular constituency other than
shareholders as a whole,&quot; reports the <U>Daily Labor Report</U>.
 The SEC ignored the management view and ordered inclusion of
the proposal that was drafted by the Independent Brotherhood of
Dupont Workers.
<P><a name="three"></a>
<i><B>Employers Are Fighting Back:</B></i>
<P>
<B>Field Hearings Focus on &quot;Salting&quot; as a Corporate
Campaign Technique</B>
<P>
Some of unions' most abusive campaign tactics came under fire
April 12 as contractors and their employees took their cases to
a congressional field hearing in Kansas City.  At issue was the
union scheme of &quot;salting&quot; - work sites with union organizers
who file discrimination charges with the National Labor Relations
Board (NLRB), disrupt work, and run-up employer costs.  Union
manipulation of the law and NLRB complicity were the primary themes.
<P>
Gregory E. Hoberock's testimony was typical:  &quot;Forcing employers
to hire persons whose intent is to bankrupt the employer does
not make sense.&quot;  His family-owned business in Union, Missouri,
suffered dozens of frivolous charges filed with the NLRB at a
cost of $15,000 to $25,000 in legal fees.
<P>
The hearing was called by Rep. Harris Fawell (R-IL), Chair of
the House Opportunities Committee Employer-Employee Relations
Subcommittee, and Small Business Committee Chair Jan Meyers (R-KS).
 Rep. Fawell has introduced, H.R. 3211, the &quot;Truth in Employment
Act,&quot; addressing the problem of salting.  As he stated at
the hearing, H.R. 3211 &quot;merely seeks to alleviate the legal
pressure imposed upon employers to hire individuals whose overriding
purpose for seeking the job is not to become a bona fide employee,
but to organize the employer's workplace and/or otherwise inflict
economic harm on the employer.&quot;
<P>
The criticism of salting was not limited to business owners. 
Electrician Richard Oberlechner complained, &quot;We are tired
of the harassment tactics [by unions], both on a company basis
and against us individually.&quot; Echoing the concerns of many,
he stressed, &quot;We do not want our future jeopardized for the
monetary gains of others.&quot;
<P>
The message to Congress was compelling.  &quot;Right now it is
David facing not one, but two Goliaths...the unions with their
large coffers and the NLRB,&quot; said David Meyer of Meyer Brothers
Building Co., a Blue Springs, Missouri general contractor employing
50 workers.  He concluded, &quot;Small businesses are the backbone
of our country.  Please do not stand by and watch the small businesses
and our FREE ENTERPRISE system be destroyed by the unions and
a tax-supported branch of our government.&quot;

<i><B>As John Sweeney Sees It </B>- </i>
<P>
<B>Labor <I>Can't</I> Do It On It's Own</B>
<P>
&quot;We're in the battle of our life,&quot; declares AFL-CIO
President John J. Sweeney.  &quot;If we don't change this Congress,
believe me, we've only seen a taste of what their agenda will
be.&quot;
<P>
With this rallying cry, Sweeney told a conference of the New York
State Labor-Religion Coalition that the key to labor's strategy
for the future is building coalitions with religious, environmental
and other groups.  Also key, according to Sweeney, is electing
a Democratic Congress.
<P><a name="five"></a>
<i><B>Minimum Wage Madness</B></i>
<P>
Maybe Republican members of Congress supporting a $1.00 increase
in the minimum wage need to contact the Democratic Leadership
Council (DLC) to get a primer on why the wage hike is bad for
business and bad for workers.  
<P>
According to the DLC, the &quot;moderate&quot; Democratic institution
once led by President Clinton, the wage hike is &quot;counterproductive,
raising prices for poor people while helping mainly middle class
families.&quot;  The hike would also &quot;reduce job creation
 for low- skilled people.&quot;
<P>
The DLC continues, &quot;Increasing the minimum wage would produce
a regressive transfer, making most poor people a little worse
off in order to improve the lives, at least for a time, of a group
of people which is predominately non-poor.&quot;
<P><a name="six"></a>
 <i><B>Starting Wage Fact</B>:</i>
<P>
The 90-cent starting wage hike will directly cost business $12.3
billion over the next 5 years according to the CBO.

<blockquote>
<i><B>Another Clinton Payback Owed</i> - Clinton Coordinated Closely
With </B>
<P>
<b>Unions During Government Shutdown</b><P>
Led by the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE),
the unions helped President Clinton develop his confrontational
strategy with Republicans over the budget, and were informed that
the shutdown, as well as a delay in increasing government's borrowing
authority, would not adversely impact government operations and
 social security,  or  other transfer payments.  At the same time,
the Treasury Dept. was telling the public exactly the opposite.
 According to an April 1, <I><B>Washington Times</B></I> story,
the AFGE did not tell members about Treasury's use of retirement
funds.  Instead it sent weekly alerts to its members warning about
the default's &quot;danger.&quot;
<P><a name="two"></a>
<i><B>The Reich Report: Mixed Messages</B></i>
<P>
Is the U.S. economy creating high-wage or dead-end jobs?  The
answer depends on what soil Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich is
standing.
<P>
In France earlier this month, Reich defended the 8.4 million jobs
that have been created while the Clinton Administration has been
in office.  Apparently, Europeans are under the impression that
these are low-skilled and low-wage jobs.  He and the Administration
boasted that &quot;the fastest growing job categories in the U.S.
are the highest paying ones...60 percent of those new jobs are
high-wage positions in areas such as finance, telecommunications,
and other high-tech areas.&quot;
<P>
At home, Reich follows the union cue and bemoans the &quot;anxious
class&quot; fearful of dead-end jobs.  The Labor Secretary's friends
at the AFL-CIO dictate a similar message.  A union resolution
declares:  &quot;Loaded with debt... threatened with downsizing
and outsourcing, and a growing pool of low-wage, no-benefit contingent
labor, American workers are frustrated, anxious and angry.&quot;
 
<P>
Except for some unwarranted credit taking, Reich was on the ball
while in France.  The next time he speaks on the issue in the
U.S., employers hope he speaks as glowingly about American jobs
as he does overseas.
<P><a name="three"></a>
<i><B>The Corporate Campaign: USA Today, Now More Than Ever</B></i>
<P>
It's official, reading<I><B> USA Today</B></I> is now politically
incorrect.  Top union boss John Sweeney has ordered unionists
not to buy or advertise in the national newspaper because its
owner, Gannett Publishing, has refused to yield to union demands
in Detroit.  A similar &quot;Do Not Buy&quot; order went out against
<I><B>The Miami Herald</B></I>, the flagship paper of Knight-Ridder.
<P>
The much publicized union strike against the<I><B> Detroit Free
Press</B></I> and <I><B>Detroit News</B></I> is going into its
ninth month.  Undaunted by formal complaints by the government
and by legal action arising out of the strikers' campaign of violence,
the union hopes to broaden public awareness of their dispute.
 As AFL-CIO leader Richard Trumka vowed last month, &quot;We will
be moving on a rather nationwide basis to expose what Gannett
is doing to workers in Detroit.&quot;
<P>
The unions have recently gone into competition with the Detroit
papers by publishing their own &quot;Sunday Journal&quot; for
which they are soliciting advertisers.  No doubt the real Detroit
newspapers are not worried about the new weekly.  With union work
rules, featherbedding, and grievance procedures, it is highly
unlikely that the strikers' &quot;Sunday Journal&quot; will turn
a profit in this lifetime.
<P><a name="four"></a>
<i><B>Labor Chat - Spiked AFL-CIO Survey From '94 Resurfaces on the
Internet</B></i>
<P>
According to a 1994 posting on Labor Talk, an on-line newsgroup
through the Institute for Global Communications, a '94 survey
commissioned by the AFL-CIO was too embarrassing to share with
the public - or its own members for that matter.
<P>
The survey, &quot;Being Heard,&quot; included these findings:
<P>
<ul>
<li>Of the 4 out of 5 Americans living in non-union households,
only 29% have positive feelings about unions, 39% negative, and
32% neutral.
<P>
<li> Only 25% feel that unions are concerned about all working
people - 65% say that unions are concerned only about their members.
</ul>
<P>
The authors of the report, a pro-labor consulting firm, also concluded
that the unions were perceived as &quot;undemocratic institutions,&quot;
increasingly irrelevant, and &quot;outdated, old-fashioned, hidebound
guardians of the status quo.&quot;  According to the Labor Talk
article, the report was published on March 21, 1994.
<P><a name="five"></a>
<i><B>Union Money Making &quot;Fad&quot;</B></i>
<P>
Like a sponge to water, organized labor has taken to soaking money
from the U.S. Treasury.  According to the Federal Assistance Awards
Data System (FAADS), unions receive over $39 million per year
in grants through not-for-profit organizations, and the U.S. Department
of Labor.  The following unions and their affiliates were some
of the recipients during 1993-1994:
<P><pre>
AFL-CIO    				$2,038,000
<P>
AFSME       				$148,000
<P>
American Fed of Teachers     		$143,000
<P>
American Nurses Assoc.        		$965,000
<P>
Int'l Assoc of Machinists  		$1,770,000
<P>
National Education Assoc.       	$385,000
<P>
Teamsters       			$3,542,000
<P>
Service Employees Int'l Union		$137,000
<P>
United Auto Workers            		$805,000
<P>
United Brotherhood of Carpenters	$257,000

<blockquote>
<i><B>Pressure from the Pressmen</B></i>
<P>
The Clinton National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has shown its
prounion colors, judging from a recent Court of Appeals decision.
 It appears that the union-packed NLRB has forgotten the violence
that marked the 1985 strike against the <I>Chicago Tribune</I>
stirred by the hiring of replacement workers.  The strike ended
in 1986, and by May, 1989 the process of reinstating striking
workers was well on the way.  The Pressman's union has since been
seeking the names and the addresses of replacement workers who
are still employed at the <I>Tribune.</I>
<P>
The NLRB ordered the <I>Tribune</I> to furnish the names and addresses
of replacement employees to the union on the basis that the &quot;passage
of five years since the violence tilted the balance in favor of
disclosure.&quot;   A ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the Seventh Circuit has however, refused to enforce the NLRB order.
 Violence against replacement workers during the strike included
tire slashing, death threats, as well as the stabbing of a delivery
driver. 
<P>
The <I>Tribune</I> offered to conduct a third party mailing to
the replacement workers, would permit communications during nonwork
times, the posting of union notices on company bulletin boards
and allow distribution of union notices in nonwork areas.  Replacement
employees could also choose to provide the union with their own
address.  This was not good enough though for the union or its
supporters on the Labor Board. The federal court disagreed with
both the NLRB and the union to ensure employee protections.
<P><a name="two"></a>
<i><B>Whose Rights Are They Anyway? </B></i>
<P>
Employees have the right to object to union political activities,
but it is illegal for employers to tell them so.  That is the
argument behind a complaint filed by the General Counsel of the
Labor Board against nursing home operator Beverly Enterprises.
<P>
The company has been cited for breaking labor laws by notifying
employees of their rights under the Supreme Court's <U>Beck</U>
decision.  That case recognized the right to object to paying
the portion of compulsory union dues which is spent on political
causes opposed by the employee.
<P>
The Clinton NLRB recently ruled that unions are not required by
law to give their members effective notice of their <U>Beck</U>
rights.  If the Labor Board is successful in its case against
Beverly, employers will be prohibited from letting their employees
in on this secret.  That leaves to Clinton appointees the task
of spreading the word about rights the unions oppose.
<P><a name="three"></a>
<i><B>No Minority Rights</B></i>
<P>
Like all democratic institutions, union bosses are supposed to
represent the views of their constituents - the dues paying members.
 So if a large share of union members vote Republican, the elected
union officials pay heed, right?
<P>
You be the judge.  A recent Communications Workers of America
(CWA) union poll showed that its members favored President Clinton
over Bob Dole by 53% to 27%.  The union's executive council unanimously
endorsed the Clinton-Gore ticket.  CWA President Mort Bahr says
&quot;our jobs is to make sure the 53% [favoring Clinton] stays.&quot;
 Bahr is also reported to have charged his members to work for
the election of  Democrats to the U.S. House in an effort to recapture
the chamber.
<P><a name="four"></a>
<i><B>Attention Blue Light Shoppers -</B></i>
<br>
<B>Campaign Targets K-mart</B>
<P>
One of America's retail giants is experiencing a text book corporate
campaign.  The target: Kmart.  Unions are working every angle
to convert productive employees of the company into dues paying
members so they can attack every level of the company's operations.
<P>
The International Brotherhood of Teamsters and Union of Needletrades
Industrial and Textile Employees (UNITE) are seeking employee
representation on the company's board of directors.  They are
also pressing for annual board elections for all directors and
the elimination of retirement plans for nonemployee directors.
 The unions believe that their representation on the board will
also improve Kmart's stock value. 
<P>
The Teamsters represent a small percentage of Kmart employees
and own 500,000 shares of the company's stock.  UNITE is currently
seeking to organize over 500 Kmart employees in Greensboro, NC.
 Last fall, the union made allegations of discriminatory employment
practices and instituted a consumer boycott - standard tactics
in corporate campaigns.
<P>
The unions are backing Stephen Hester for Kmart's board.  Hester's
speciality is  employee stock ownership programs, and he is credited
with helping unionized employees of Northwest Airlines gain stock
ownership and representation on its board of directors.
<P>
The Teamsters and UNITE blame the lack of  an  independent voice
on the board of directors for the decline in Kmart's stock value.
 They see Kmart competitor, Wal-Mart, gaining  a significant share
of the market.  No doubt when the unions decide to take on non-union
Wal-Mart, they will  conclude that Wal-Mart's competitive edge
could vastly improve with union representation.

<blockquote>
<B>Sweeney Youth to be Trained for &quot;Union Summer&quot;</B>
<P>
AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney wants to train members of the
MTV generation to be union activists.  Desperate for new dues-paying
members, he has devised a plan to recruit the children of existing
members - and other young people - into service this summer. 
Participants will promote the joys of union membership under the
guise of social justice.
<P>
The three-month boot camp, called &quot;Union Summer,&quot; will
immerse young recruits in union rhetoric, teach the the principles
of union activism and put them to work on organizing campaigns
and union projects around the country.
<P>
In a recruitment flyer for &quot;Union Summer,&quot; the AFL-CIO
asks prospects to &quot;join hundreds of workers and students
making history.  Spend three weeks in the streets and neighborhoods,
organizing for workplace rights and social justice.  Make this
a summer America will never forget!&quot;
<P>
&quot;Union Summer&quot; applications are currently being accepted.
 Applicants are asked to &quot;describe a defining moment or life
experience that relates to your desire to fight injustice.&quot;
<P><a name="two"></a>
<B>New Clinton Payback Revealed</B>
<P>
In a recent address before the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, House
Republican Conference Chairman, John Boehner (R-OH) revealed President
Clinton's latest payback to organized labor.  According to Boehner,
just two weeks before receiving big labor's endorsement, Bill
Clinton &quot;instructed the government's personnel office to
proved labor unions with the home addresses of all federal employees
in bargaining units - whether or not they are union members.&quot;
<P>
<I><B>Labor Watch</B></I> pondered the potential uses of this
data:  re-elect Clinton campaign, political literature, mailings
of related union propaganda, and personal visits to the homes
of nonmembers.
<P><a name="three"></a>
<B>Cookie Monsters: Tales from the Corporate Campaign Front</B>
<P>
The St. Louis Girl Scouts are the latest target of a union corporate
campaign.  Members of an electrical workers union local have threatened
a boycott, and are picketing two Girl Scout camps in Eastern Missouri
after a nonunion electrical contractor was awarded the work for
major renovations and construction at the camps.
<P>
Building and Construction Trades Council officials have warned
the area executive director of the detrimental impact upon her
organization over its failure to use union contractors.  She agreed
to try to change the decision.  The pickets remain camped out
while awaiting the final outcome, and plans to put the Girl Scouts
on the unions' &quot;We Do Not Patronize&quot; list were put on
hold.
<P>
The question remains as to whether union officials will issue
the ultimate boycott - a refusal to buy Girl Scout cookies.
<P><a name="four"></a>
<B>Union Backing</B>
<P>
A kindler, gentler union movement?  You decide.  Richard Trumka,
AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer, recently whipped the Pennsylvania
union conventioneers into a frenzy with this rallying cry:  &quot;Our
message is that unions are back.  Get in our way and we'll knock
you flat on your (expletive).&quot;
<P><a name="five"></a>
<B>&quot;Government Stewardship&quot; of Unions  Lousy Says Union
Members</B>
<P>
Even Teamsters complain that government can't run anything right.
 In response to petitions from 12,000 rank-and-file members of
the union, two Members of Congress are seeking a review of the
effectiveness of the Independent Review Board (IRB), which oversees
the operation of the nation's largest labor organization.
<P>
In a consent decree with the Justice Department, the IRB was formed
in 1989 to root out organized crime within the Teamsters and monitor
its financial affairs.  Reps. Michael Flanagan (R-IL) and William
Lipinski (D-IL) report that union members &quot;contend the union's
financial condition has worsened in its years under government
stewardship&quot; and have called for an investigation.
<P><a name="six"></a>
<B>Rights on the Left</B>
<P>
Some Rights are more right than others, in the union mindset.
 Beating the union drum at the March 25 AFL-CIO convention in
Washington, Vice President Gore blasted Republicans and demonstrated
the Administration's affinity with Big Labor as he declared: &quot;To
them, the right to strike is a luxury...but to us the right to
strike is a right.&quot;
<P>
The right to work, on the other hand, is considered an unsavory
concept by the AFL-CIO.  National Right to Work is high on their
hit list of proposed legislation in these days of frantic efforts
to shore up dwindling union rolls.  If workers could no longer
be forced to join unions in order to keep their jobs, the decline
in union membership might just go into freefall.

<i><B>Another Clinton Payback - &quot;Prevailing Waste&quot;</B></i>

<P>
&quot;We were caught abetting fraud and incompetence, so give
us more money.&quot; That is the unmistakable message from the
Labor Department as it tries to explain a request to spend $3.75
million more to administer the Davis-Bacon Act.
<P>
Last year the Department of Labor stonewalled every effort to
expose fraud in the calculation of &quot;prevailing wages&quot;
which federal government contractors must pay under the Davis-Bacon
Act. Until pressure came to bear, the Department refused to provide
access to public documents or even to disclose the names of union
officials who submitted bogus data - data which the DOL says it
relies on to calculate wages. Without the dogged determination
of Oklahoma Commissioner of Labor, Brenda Reneau, who uncovered
the fraud, and the outrage of Reps. Cass Ballenger (R-NC) and
Pete Hoekstra (R-MI), the federal Department would have denied
any problems existed.
<P>
In an investigation by Reneau and her staff, it was found that
&quot;certain parties&quot; submitted bogus projects to the DOL
including inflated wage rates of ghost employees.
<P>
This week the DOL admits in the Clinton Budget that &quot;the
current [wage determination] system's reliance on the 'third party'
data submissions has recently exposed the vulnerability to manipulation
through submission of false or selective data, and raises serious
questions about the accuracy of some of the wage determinations
that are issued.&quot;
<P>
The Labor Department's answer to those questions: Pour about $4
million more into the black hole of Davis-Bacon. In the near future
ABC t.v. program<I> 20/20</I> will air a special report on Davis-Bacon.
Investigative reporter, John Stossel produced the segment.

<i><B>BIG LABOR'S REAL AGENDA: </i>
<br>Clinton Appointee Fired for
Aiding a Corporate Campaign - Big Labor-Big Government Incestuous
Relationship Exposed</B> 
<P>
A top Department of Labor (DOL) appointee has been forced from
office because of his efforts to abet a union's corporate campaign.
Richard Sawyer, Labor Secretary Reich's chief representative in
the West, lost his job March 8 for contacting Hewlett-Packard
Co - threatening the company that the DOL would seize its products
- because its janitorial service, (which the Service Employees
union are attempting to organize) was &quot;going to get caught
doing bad things eventually.&quot; Mr. Sawyer is a former Service
Employees International Union (SEIU) local president.
<P>
The target of the corporate campaign was Somers Building Maintenance
in Sacramento, California. Board member for the company, Randy
Schraber, said, &quot;We were the subject of wrongdoing, and we're
pleased to see that it won't happen to another company.&quot;
<P>
Rep. Pete Hoekstra (R-MI) had investigated the incident and concluded
that Mr. Sawyer had &quot;disclosed investigative information
which was damaging to Somers,&quot; and &quot;influenced the Department
of Labor's Wage &amp; Hour Division in an attempt to intimidate
Somers into recognizing the union.&quot; After Hoekstra made Sawyer's
action public, the DOL was forced to oust the presidential appointee.
<P>
An Inspector General's (IG) report investigating the California
incident confirms allegations that Sawyer threatened Hewlett-Packard.
The report also showed that no actions had been taken against
Somers in regards to charges that they violated wage and hour
laws. Half of California's wage and hour investigators had been
assigned to the Somer's case. According to Mr. Schraber, the investigators
found that the janitorial company actually <I>overpaid</I> its
workers between $300 - $600.
<P>
SEIU has quickly come to the defense of Sawyer by mobilizing California's
unions in a lobbying effort aimed at President Clinton and Reich
on his behalf. Hoekstra's subcommittee is planning to hold hearings
on the DOL's political motivation behind the Somer's incident
and other cases. The subcommittee will also look into alleged
politicization of OSHA and the National Labor Relations Board.

<i><B>AFL-CIO TO MEET IN WASHINGTON - </B></i>
<br>
<B>CLINTON ENDORSEMENT, SWEENEY TAX LIKELY</B> 
<P>
The AFL-CIO is expecting over 500 union delegates to gather at
the Capitol Hilton in Washington, D.C. next week. The union leaders
are expected to endorse President Clinton's reelection bid, and
ratify a special assessment on each union member to help subsidize
AFL-CIO Chief Sweeney's political and organizing agenda. Central
Council leaders will hold meetings on Sunday, March 24, and state
federation delegates will meet through Tuesday, March 26.
<P>
A key agenda item is the 15 cents monthly fee that each union
member will be charged, adding $2 million per month to union coffers.
The funds will go to pay for a $35 million dollar &quot;grassroots
campaign&quot; to heavily promote unions, as well as subsidize
an ongoing series of political ads targeting freshman Republican
members of Congress for elimination in this fall's elections.
The funds will also be used to step up the use of corporate campaigns.
Unions hope that the campaign will rally support for their political
agenda and establish a permanent pool of 100 union grassroots
activists in each Congressional district.

<i><B>Time Out for Teamsters</B> </i>
<P>
Grand theft is a felony which carries hefty prison terms and loss
of voting rights for life; but for Teamsters bosses, it brings
a one-year suspension. That is the penalty imposed by Teamsters
President Ron Carey against three Minnesota Teamsters officials
who were guilty of embezzling funds from their local.
<P>
In addition to their suspension, the three will be barred from
holding any Teamster office for two years. A fourth official was
permanently barred from membership or holding office, and all
must share in fines totalling $189,000.
<P>
An internal report by a court-appointed Independent Review Board
found numerous questionable practices, including selling union
cars at markedly discounted rates, and charging members fees to
attend their own union meetings.

<i><B>The Reich Report</B></i>
<P>
Labor Secretary Robert Reich touts &quot;corporate responsibility&quot;
on the speaking circuit, but it appears he has been a little more
than irresponsible with taxpayer dollars.  According to a <I>Wall
Street Journal</I> article, the Joint Committee on Printing (JCP)
contends that  Reich sidestepped federal guidelines by rushing
a printing job to an all-night copying service without &quot;prior
approval.&quot;  The JCP has rejected Reich's request to pay Kinko's
of Washington for the unapproved printing job.  Labor officials
finished President Clinton's &quot;Middle-Class Bill of Rights&quot;
too late they say to have the Government Printing Office (GPO)
do the job - the document was ready for printing late in the evening
on the eve of the State of the Union address last year.  The 18-page
document will reportedly cost taxpayers $31,380 - if Kinko's ever
gets paid - compared to the GPO price of $500.  Rep. Pete Hoekstra,
chairman of the House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigation
is apparently outraged by the waste.  The Labor Department contends
that the incident is turning into &quot;something political.&quot;
 
<P>
Perhaps the &quot;Middle-Class Bill of Rights&quot; should have
included a section on the responsible use of tax dollars by government
officials who portend to represent the hard-working middle class.

<i><B>BIG LABOR'S REAL AGENDA:</i><br>CORPORATE CAMPAIGN TARGET FIGHTS BACK
- VICTORIOUS OVER SEIU MILITANT TACTICS</B>
<P>
A Washington, D.C. jury may have stopped  a local Justice for
Janitors &quot;in-your-face&quot; campaign in its tracks.  The
decision may have an effect on similar cases nationwide according
to the winning attorney.
<P>
On October 21, 1993, Justice for Janitors invaded the headquarters
of United States Service Industries, Inc. (USSI), a janitorial
company that cleans office buildings in the D.C. area.  The nationwide
Janitors' campaign is the brainchild of former Service Employees
International Union (SEIU) leader John Sweeney who now heads the
AFL-CIO.  
<P>
According to a press statement released by USSI, Justice for Janitors
assaulted an officer of the corporation, and kept employees imprisoned
for several hours preventing them from leaving the building. 
<P>
Three USSI employees sued.  The Union settled with one employee,
and the other two went to trial.  A jury found there was an assault
and battery, as well as false imprisonment of both employees.
 One employee was awarded $1,000, and the other $2,000 in compensatory
damages by a jury verdict on March 11, 1996.  In addition, $30,000
in punitive damages were awarded on March 13, 1996, as a result
of clear and convincing evidence that the union demonstrators
were motivated by ill-will and willful disregard for the rights
of others.
<P>
USSI attorney, Joel Keiler, believes that future activities of
this kind could result in much larger punitive awards.  Keiler
also believes that individuals and companies nationwide will use
this verdict in their impending lawsuits, as will many of those
who were trapped by demonstrating SEIU &quot;Janitors&quot; who
blocked traffic on the 14th Street Bridge and the Roosevelt Bridge
in Washington, D.C.  last year.

<i> <B>NLRB's Gould Continues Campaign For Single-Site Rule</B></i>
<P>
Earlier this week in Tampa, Fla., National  Labor Relations Board
(NLRB) Chairman William Gould continued pushing for his proposed
single-site facility rule - a rule designed to help unions more
easily organize small businesses, and single units of multifacility
businesses such as fast-food restaurant chains.
<P>
The single-site rule would be a boon for AFL-CIO chief John Sweeney,
who wants to make good on his promise to more aggressively and
successfully organize the largely non-union service sector.  The
single-site rule applies one-size-fits-all standards to organizing,
applying illegitimate union organizing preferences over legitimate
market and business issues.  Opposition from the Republican Congress
and the business community has been fierce on the issue, but Gould
predicted that the NLRB would prevail.

<b><i>How</i> NOT <i>to Win Friends and Influence People</B></i>
<P>
Hoping to unionize thousands of Kaiser Permanente workers in North
Carolina, organized labor in that state has joined regulators
in denouncing the quality of care provided by the big HMO.  Criticizing
the product a company manufacturers may work in the case of bluejeans,
but a fatal flaw exists in the union's strategy  of attacking
the delivery of health care.  The unions are criticizing  the
very people they hope to organize - the HMO health care workers.
<P>
Of course, a &quot;fair&quot; contract is the cure prescribed
by the labor bosses.  They also hope it will undue any public
relations damage caused by the unions' smear campaign against
Kaiser Permanente workers.

<i><B>Minimum Wage Campaigns Take Off in the States</B></i>
<P>
As part of their multi-faceted election-year strategy to galvanize
union members to the polls, labor unions and allied groups are
aggressively attempting to put minimum wage increase initiatives
on the ballot in the upcoming November elections.  The AFL-CIO
is leading the signature gathering charge in most states with
the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN)
lending a hand.  Signature drives are up and running in Arizona,
California, Idaho, Missouri, Montana, and Oregon - with other
states targeted for activity soon.
<P>
On March 25, the AFL-CIO will hold a special meeting in Washington,
DC to kick-off their &quot;America Needs a Raise&quot; road show
(while at the same time increasing their own rank-and-file union
membership dues.)  The 29-city tour will promote the minimum wage
issue.  States that are currently considering starting wage increases
in state legislatures are also targeted for a campaign stop. 
For a complete listing of efforts to increase the starting wage
at the state and local level, contact Ren&eacute;e Stikes at 202-785-0238.
<P><a name="two"></a>
<i><B>Old Salt</B></i>
<P>
The career of the new chief organizer for the AFL-CIO, Richard
Bensinger, proves that unions are doing nothing new.  They're
just more blatant about it.
<P>
In the 1970's, while working as a paid union organizer, Bensinger
went undercover at a nonunion apparel plant in Colorado.  He was
quickly promoted into management, and was able to feed the union
valuable information on the company's response strategy to an
organizing campaign.
<P>
Today's unions, particularly those in the construction industry,
forego undercover work and opt instead to smother nonunion competition.
 The so-called &quot;salting campaign&quot; orders union members
to (1) apply for work at the target company, (2) make clear their
union affiliation, (3) organize other workers, if hired, (4) file
NLRB charges if not hired, (5) lure away good employees to work
for union contractors, and (6) generally create bedlam and other
problems on the job site - all at the direction of the union.
<P>
Bensinger is now directing the salting scheme nationwide that
he perfected in Colorado 20 years ago.  He serves as Deputy Director
of the AFL-CIO Organizing Institute.
<P>
Bensinger was quoted recently as saying: &quot;We're not crazy
radicals out to destroy a company; we're into cooperating with
a company...&quot;
<P>
The Electrical Workers are a little more honest about the real
purpose of salting campaigns: &quot;to threaten or actually apply
the economic pressure necessary to  cause the employers to...raise
his prices to recoup additional costs, scale back his business
activities, leave the union jurisdiction, go out of business,
and so on.<I> (IBEW Union Organizer Manual) </I>
<P><a name="three"></a>
<i><B>BIG LABOR'S REAL AGENDA: Palming Off Jobs </B></i>
<P>
<B> An Update From the Corporate Campaign Front</B>
<P>
Anywhere but in labor relations, barely mustering a support rate
of 14% is considered an abysmal failure.  But the Palm Restaurant
of Boston knuckled under to &quot;public pressure&quot; when 27
of 200 local celebrities refused to let their caricatures be hung
on the eatery's walls due to union complaints.
<P>
<I>Labor Watch</I> readers may recall this latest corporate campaign
which discovered this  particular victim's unique charm and sought
to destroy it.  The restaurant's well-known &quot;wall of fame&quot;
honors local notables as its feature attraction.  Construction
unions waged their anti-caricature campaign because they were
offended that the restaurant selected an open shop contractor
who bid 38% below the union competition.
<P>
Of the 200 celebrities offered spots on the restaurant walls,
only 27 - or less than 14%  - sided with the union and refused
to participate.  One of those sympathizers, Boston Mayor, Thomas
Merino, negotiated a deal that requires the restaurant to rebid
up to $100,000 of work using union workers.  All future work is
slated to go to union firms.  Even as the country approaches the
21st century, organized labor continues to demonstrate that an
aggressive minority - 15% union membership in the work force,
14% of celebrities - can overcome market and economic logic.
<P><a name="four"></a>
<i><B>Sweeny Predicts</B></i>
<P>
&quot;If Affirmative Action goes down, Davis-Bacon, the Service
Contract Act, the Fair Labor Standards Act and the minimum wage
bill will all follow,&quot; said AFL-CIO boss John Sweeney to
Jesse Jackson's Rainbow Coalition.  Now those fighting labor's
agenda know where to start.
<P><a name="five"></a>
<i><B>The Check is Not in the Mail</B></i>
<P>
What is it about the Post Office that promotes antisocial behavior?
 Postal union presidents are lambasting Postmaster General Marvin
Runyon in the harshest of terms for &quot;stingily, crassly, and
greedily&quot; postponing a cost of living increase for two weeks.
 The amount withheld from employee paychecks?  Four dollars.
<P>
Postal worker unions typically tie up the legal system by filing
petty complaints - amounting to 7% of the National Labor Relation
Board's entire case load. Forget the rain, sleet, and dark of
night ... a national grievance over a delayed increase of $4.00
is now worth halting mail delivery. 
<P><a name="six"></a>
<i><B>AP Study Finds Unions Abuse OSHA</B></i>
<P>
Employee complaints to OSHA increase during labor unrest, according
to an extensive Associated Press (AP) analysis.  Over a third
of job site inspections prompted by complaints at unionized facilities
turn up no violations at all, says the AP study.  Complaints filed
by nonunion workers are more likely to lead to real safety problems
the study concludes.

<blockquote>
<i><B>Another Clinton Payback - When Even 99% Is Not Enough</B></i>
<P>
The AFL-CIO is complaining about a recent decision by the Clinton
National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) which went 99% of the way
to gutting important employee protections from union abuses. 
Eight years after the Supreme Court ruled that workers <U>cannot
be forced </U>to pay for the political activities of unions, the
Board issued its first interpretation of the so-called <U>Beck</U>
decision.  Except in the clearest form of political bankrolling,
according to the NLRB, unions are free to spread out their costs
among all members.
<P>
What has the unions so upset is the one part of the case that
went against them.  As AFL-CIO attorney Jon Hiatt said: &quot;Perhaps
the most significant - and distressing - aspect of the decision
is the holding that unions have a legal obligation to affirmatively
tell employees that they do not have to become union members.&quot;
 
<P>
<B>The unions are outraged that employees must be informed that
union membership is a choice, not a mandate.</B>
<P>
National Right-to-Work Committee spokesman Tom McCorville had
these comments regarding the real victims of the case:
<P>
&quot;A string of Supreme Court precedents have been ignored.
 Instead, the Clinton-appointed NLRB has genuflected to Big Labor
in an election year - when employees are most in need of protection
against forced dues politicking.  As far as Big Labor's forced-dues
funded political activities goes, it's business as usual.&quot;
<P><a name="two"></a>
<i><B>The High Price of a Sweeney Presidency</B></i>
<P>
AFL-CIO head John Sweeney promised to spend $35 million on political
activity this year to reportedly &quot;defeat Republicans,&quot;
but he never said where the money was going to come from.  It
now appears that Sweeney's &quot;American Needs a Raise&quot;
campaign will probably come out of the pockets of the rank-and-file
membership.
<P>
The high price of Sweeney's new campaign is in need of a new &quot;spending
stream.&quot; Consequently, a special convention has been called
for in late March to approve a new &quot;assessment&quot; on each
union member to subsidize Sweeney's political action agenda. 
The new &quot;Sweeney Tax&quot; is expected to cost members 15
cents per month (generating $20 million).  Each affiliated union
is expected to kick in a contribution as well.
<P>
Sweeney promised to recruit hundreds of thousands of new members
to invigorate the labor movement.  But it looks like he's going
back to the trough to further milk the rank-and-file membership
in order to subsidize an uninspiring union agenda.  
<P><a name="three"></a>
<i><B>BIG LABOR'S Real Agenda: Creating Some Havoc</B></i>
<P>
<B>Tales from the Corporate Campaign Front</B>
<P>
The following is the first installment in a case study on how
unions today try to crush those companies that fail to cave in
to their demands.  The case - the seven month old Detroit newspaper
strike.
<P>
Until now, the strike against the <I>Detroit Free Press</I> and
the <I>Detroit News</I> has utilized anticipated tactics:  replacement
workers have been terrorized, advertisers have been intimidated,
and NLRB charges have flowed.  The unions have proudly declared
that the newspaper companies have lost substantial amounts of
money, fostered bad will in the community, and the loss of newspaper
circulation will take a long time to rebuild.
<P>
The unions are now exploring ways to &quot;create some havoc -
to find leverage...,&quot; says Teamsters boss Ron Carey. Lately,
activists have been distributing propaganda at the headquarters
of <I>Detroit Free Press</I> parent Knight-Ridder, and its own
flagship paper, <I>The Miami Herald</I>.  Actions against <I>Detroit
News</I> owner Gannett are being promised at its <I>USA Today</I>
headquarters in suburban Washington.  As AFL-CIO leader Rich Trumka
vowed, &quot;We will be moving on a rather nationwide basis to
expose what Gannett is doing to workers in Detroit.&quot; 
<P>
What those moves will be is an indication of how far organized
labor will go in the 1990s to preserve featherbedding and other
rampant union abuses.
<P><a name="four"></a>
<i><B>Achy Breaky Kneecaps</B></i>
<P>
Billy Ray Cryus' dad is living his own version of the country
singer's smash hit, &quot;Achy Breaky Heart.&quot;  Ron Cyrus
has a number of jobs.  The senior Cyrus is the head of the Kentucky
AFL-CIO, a state Representative for Flatwoods, and Chairman of
the Labor &amp; Industry Committee in the state legislature.
<P>
Ron's latest opus is a bill to prohibit employers from hiring
permanent replacements during strikes in the strike-happy state.
 Billy Ray may make his fans swoon, but Dad appears satisfied
with bringing companies to their knees.
<P><a name="five"></a>
 <i><B>Command and Control Corporate Welfare</B></i>
<P>
Senate Democrats unleashed a set of proposals this week to appease
every ally of their party, while providing a boost to themes echoed
by Labor Secretary Robert Reich and - not surprisingly - principles
found within Labor's &quot;America Needs a Raise&quot; campaign.
<P>
The plan, called &quot;Building Allies for America's Working Families,&quot;
links business tax cuts and de-regulation to liberal, anti-business
precepts of class warfare, and statist ideals of  &quot;corporate
social responsibility.&quot;  Of course, the program is saturated
with union promotion.
<P>
In order to qualify for a tax cut, a company must limit CEO pay,
participate in a collectively bargained (union) pension plan utilizing
an employee trustee, invest in employee training on an ongoing
basis, and meet other standards that (for the most part) give
unions and the government control of participating businesses.
 The &quot;Building Allies&quot; program not only echoes AFL-CIO
themes, but is an integral part of the union's rebuilding effort.
 That is why &quot;Building Allies,&quot; in the name of economic
policy to help the struggling middle-class, also calls for treble
damages and debarment against businesses that violate labor laws.
<P>
As one commentator remarked, &quot;'Building Allies' is simply
more public relations gloss on the &quot;Unions Need a Boost&quot;
campaign by the new AFL-CIO leadership.

The Laborers International Union has a rich history of corruption.
 The Justice Department thinks it can change that with a healthy

election of officers, scheduled for September.
<P>
The Laborers leadership agreed to reforms in order to rid the
union of its tainted past of corruption and links to organized
crime, and to avoid a government takeover of its operations. 
The old system was so fraught with cronyism and fraud that a federal
overseer must now spend months devising election rules, teach

Wall Street Journal</I> reports that the building trades unions
are threatening the decor of the restaurant to force the Palm
to fire a non-union contractor and submit to build on the union's
terms (at a 38% premium).
<P>
Hoping to decimate the collection of celebrity caricatures which
adorn the walls of each Palm location, the unions are begging
local notables to pull their faces from the walls of the Palm.
 Several have acquiesced  - Sens. Ted Kennedy and John Kerry,
<I>Atlantic Monthly </I>editor Jack Beatty, and legal beagle Alan
Dershowitz.  Some, less sympathetic types, might consider this
urban renewal.

<i><B>Letter Carriers Are Big Winners in Oregon Vote-by-Mail Election</B></i>
<P>
According to a <I>Washington Times</I>  mention entitled &quot;Delivering
the Vote,&quot; the labor unions were quite pleased (in more ways
than one) with Oregon's recent special election.  The newspaper
notes:
<P>
&quot;The National Association of Letter Carriers (NALC), AFL-CIO
carried two headlines in its newsletter concerning Ron Wyden's
recent election to the Senate.  &quot;Letter Carriers Major Factor
in Wyden Oregon Senate Win,&quot; the NALC bulletin said.  &quot;Vote-by-Mail
Balloting Receives Praise.&quot;   
<P><a name="five"></a>
<i><B>AFL-CIO Charged with Crossing the Line in Campaign Activity</B></i>
<P>
The National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) filed a
complaint last week with the Federal Election Commission (FEC)
charging that &quot;PROJECT '95&quot; - an AFL-CIO special campaign
 - violated the law because its goals were to defeat House Republicans
using union members' dues.  The NRCC charges that the AFL-CIO
was engrossed in &quot;active electioneering&quot; in Federal
campaigns.  House Republicans on the PROJECT '95 target list were
saturated with radio and television advertising, and other outreach
activities in their congressional districts.  According to the
NRCC though, PROJECT '95 was coordinated with the Democratic Party
- the list of targeted House Republicans was distributed at a
key meeting of assembled House Democrats.
<P>
&quot;The AFL-CIO's PROJECT '95...misused the dues paid by the
hard-working men and women who belong to the member unions,&quot;
states a NRCC press release.  The NRCC also charges that AFL-CIO
chief John Sweeny's proclamation that the union will use $35 million
of its treasury to defeat Republicans in 1996 also violates federal
election law.

<blockquote>
<i><B>Another Clinton Payback - Fox in the Henhouse</B></i>
<P>
The name Sarah Fox is soon to become synonymous with the most
cynical form of union power grab.
<P>
Under attack for three years for politicizing the National Labor
Relations Board, the Administration pushed the envelope further
by naming Ted Kennedy's chief labor strategist to a recess appointment.
 Acting in the dead of night with questionable legal authority,
President Clinton installed the legislative specialist in the
role of labor law judge for a &quot;temporary&quot; appointment
for up to two years.
<P>
Control of the Labor Board gives the unions an opportunity to
revitalize their agenda.  Through selective enforcement of the
labor laws, complicity in union harassment campaigns and abolition
of long-standing employer protections, the pro-union NLRB will
seek to shift the balance of power clearly in favor of labor.
 Not to mention the fact that the Board rules on allegations of
unlawful union conduct as well.
<P><a name="two"></a>
<i><B>Reich Rhetoric</B></i>
<P>
The key solution to &quot;our greatest remaining challenge&quot;
is a strong union movement.  That is the declaration of Labor
Secretary Robert B. Reich in an official publication from his
Department.
<P>
Citing a host of newly discovered evils in the economy, Reich
declares, &quot;Closing the gap between paychecks and profits
is our greatest remaining challenge.&quot;  In addition to the
usual liberal solutions of raising the minimum wage and spending
more on training, Reich offers these telling steps:  <B>Enforcing
the Nation's labor laws</B> (against employers) and <B>Maintaining
a strong labor union movement.</B>
<P>
He states, &quot;Building strength through numbers is perhaps
the most important way workers can boost their bargaining power
in order to earn a family wage.&quot;  <I><B>Translation:  </B></I>Pandering
to union leaders in official Labor Department documents is perhaps
the most important way for Bill Clinton to secure labor's endorsement.
<P><a name="three"></a>
<i><B>Big Labor's Real Agenda:</B></i>
<P>
<B> Corporate Campaigns . . . Extortion by any other name</B>
<P>
Anywhere else but under the labor laws, actions to disrupt work,
run up costs and intentionally drive the company out of business
would be considered both criminal and tortuous.  But because unions
are considered &quot;special,&quot; the rules of law do not apply
to their so-called corporate campaigns.
<P>
The Electrical Workers describe their goal as follows:  &quot;to
threaten or actually apply the economic pressure necessary to
cause the employer to...raise his prices to recoup additional
costs, scale back his business activities, leave the union's jurisdiction,
go out of business, and so on.&quot;  (<I>IBEW Union Organizing
Manual)</I>
<P>
Again...extortion by any other name. 
<P><a name="four"></a>
<I><B>Two Wrongs Make a Filibuster</B></I>
<P>
Remember the scene in &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&quot;
in which Jimmy Stewart filibusters for hours <U>against </U>corruption
and wrong.  On behalf of the unions, Democrats are filibustering
the Labor Department funding bill in <U>support</U> of wrongdoing.
<P>
That bill in the Senate has a provision that would block enforcement
of President Clinton's Executive Order prohibiting federal contractors
from hiring permanent replacements for strikers.  The Order was
recently ruled <U>illegal </U>by a federal court - but organized
labor's friends keep filibustering.
<P><a name="five"></a>
<i><B>Unions Decline Further, </B></i>
<P>
<B>Except When Government is There</B>
<P>
Union membership continues to decline, this time by 300,000 workers
in 1994 to below 15% of the work force.  Where do unions remain
strongest? In industries with the closest relationship to government.
<P>
Federal, state and local governments employ about 6.9 million
union members, or about 37.8% of public employment.  In the private
sector, heavily regulated industries such as transportation and
public utilities had the highest level of unionization at 27%.
 Construction followed with 18%, helped in large part by the Davis-Bacon
Act and other laws which inflate public construction costs and
protect unions from competition.
<P>
Labor's former stronghold, manufacturing, continued its rapid
decline, suffering fully one-fourth of the overall loss in union
members for the year.  Not surprisingly, manufacturing in recent
years has moved further away from cohabitation with government
toward free competition.

<h2>
 Clinton probably won't be a TEAM player<BR>
</h2>
by <a href="/sbsc/kerrigan.html">Karen kerrigan</a>
</center>
<P>
<blockquote>
<hr>
August 1996 -- By far, the most effective and beneficial trend
in recent decades has been the empowerment of workers through
participation in quality circles, safety committees and other
&quot;teams.&quot;  While hundreds of businesses use the team
approach -- which allows managment and employees to confer over
issues of mutual concern and interest -- recent rulings by the
National Labor Relations Board have many employers concerned that
teams violate existing labor laws.
<P>
To correct the bias of the Depression-era law, both Houses of
Congress passed the TEAM, or Teamwork for Employees and Managers
Act -- legislation that creates a safe harbor for workers and
management to confer over issues of shared interest.
<P>
Section 8(a)(2) of the National Labor Relations Act makes it an
unfair labor practice for an employer to &quot;dominate or interfere
with the formation or administration of any labor organization
or contribute financial or other support to it...&quot;  The purpose
of the law then, was to outlaw sham unions created by a company
to avoid true unionization of the employer's workplace.
<P>
In the ensuing six decades since the law was written, the workplace
has experience tremendous changes, thus making the Depression-era
law outdated and restrictive.  In 1992, the NLRB ruled that many
cooperative teams are illegal in nonunion settings.  Critics claim
that the board ignored the fact that teams are established to
address important business concerns such as quality or production.
 Worker-management cooperative teams that took up topics such
as wages, hours and working conditions, traditionally the domain
of labor unions, were treated under the law in the same manner
as if managment had created a full-blown company union.  Numerous
other decisions have further narrowed the usefulness of teams.
<P>
Organized labor opposes the TEAM Act, claiming it allows for the
formation of company-sponsored unions while hindering union organizing.
 Supports of the act vehemently disagree.  They say it provides
an outlet for employees to express their concerns and offer opinions
when no union is on the scene.  And, with only 11 percent of the
private work force represented by unions, the number of workers
who could participate in the team concept is considerable.
<P>
David Thompson, Workplace Counsel for the Washington-based Business
Leadership Council, says passage of the TEAM Act by the Congress
represents a clear turning point in workplace policy.
<P>
&quot;We are glad to see that the House and Senate both rejected
the charge of union leaders that company efforts to solve problems
through consensus were part of a vicious plot to institute company
unions,&quot; says Thompson.
<P>
According to Thompson, labor leaders will oppose any effort to
modernize the law because it weakens their political influence
and sends them down the road to irrelevancy.
<P>
&quot;Workers and management understand the need for companies
to prosper in order to stay competitive in this highly-competitive
global economy.  That is why workplace cooperatio through the
team approach is so popular,&quot; adds Thompson.
<P>
Sen. Christopher &quot;Kit&quot; Bond, Rmo., chairman of the Senate
Small Business Committee, hailed the passage of the TEAM Act by
the Senate as a major victory for small business.
<P>
&quot;This is a common-sense measure that provides those 90 percent
of employees in America who do not belong to labor unions a stronger
voice in their workplace,&quot; he noted.
<P>
The TEAM Act will make its way to the White House, but President
Clinton has promised union leaders that he will veto the bill.
 The business community has responded that the veto would represent
more political pandering to labor leaders in exchange for the
exorbitant sums of money they are putting into key congressional
races to defeat Republicans.
<P>
Thompson of the BLC says it's a sad commentary on the state of
political affairs when the president of the United States would
hold back the growth, productivity and competitiveness of American
business in order to appease special interests.
<P>
Bond agrees and adds that President Clinton's failure to sign
the TEAM Act into law would prove beyond any doubt that he is
no friend of the small-business entrepreneur.

 Business Would Suffer Under Chemical Weapons<BR>
</h2>
<p>
by <a href="/sbsc/kerrigan.html">Karen Kerrigan</a>
</center>
<P>
<blockquote>
<hr>
August 1996 -- On or before September 14, 1996, the U.S. Senate
will vote to ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) -- a
treaty with lofty goals to rid the world of chemical weapons.
 Meanwhile, thousands of American businesses are still unaware
that they will be forced to help end the production and stockpiling
of these treacherous weapons.  
<P>
For the first time in U.S. history, businesses using chemicals
for legitimate commercial purposes would be subject to international
inspections conducted by an agency falling under the umbrella
of the United Nations.
<P>
Opponents of the CWC are not only concerned that thousands of
small and medium-sized businesses would have to comply with extra-stringent
reporting requirements, but also question whether the treaty would
stop the proliferation, use and stockpiling of chemical weapons.
<P>
It is not only the big chemical companies that fall under the
treaty's new regulatory requirements, but small and medium-sized
ones that will be required to fill out burdensome paperwork and
host international bureaucrats through on-site inspections.
<P>
 Paint manufacturers, distilleries, automotive, biotechnology,
pharmaceutical, textiles, food processing and cosmetic companies
for example, could fall under the CWCW as a result of the chemicals
they use for legitimate manufacturing purposes.
<P>
According to information supplies to the Senate by the Arms Central
and Disarmament Agency, between 3,000 and 8,000 companies will
be affected by the treaty.
<P>
While several government agencies reviewing CWC document the cost
of the new treaty at $200 million per year, many experts conclude
that the costs will be much higher.  
<P>
Baker Spring of the Heritage Foundation suggest that the indirect
costs to businesses, such as those stemming from the loss of confidential
information are difficult to estimate, but &quot;billions in losses
are not out of the question.&quot;
<P>
Businesses covered by the CWC treaty would have to submit reports
to a new U.N. body called the Organization for the Prohibition
of Chemical Weapons on each chemical they use.  It is estimated
that the paperwork will take a firm about nine hours for each
&quot;Schedule 1&quot; chemical its production process uses, 7.2
hours for each &quot;Schedule 2&quot; chemical, and 2.5 hours
for each Schedule 3 chemical it uses.  
<P>
Many businesses both large and small use hundreds if not thousands
of chemicals in their manufacturing process.  Under the CWC, affected
businesses will be subjected to two types of inspection -- routine
and challenge.  The Defense Department estimates that large companies
could incur costs as high as $500,000 per inspection and small
firms may incur costs between $10,000 - $20,000.  Each business
inspected also must pick up the tab for the inspectors meals and
lodging.  
<P>
The inspectors would represent various countries signing the CWC,
but not the United States. 
<P>
 Besides sharing proprietary business information with international
inspectors, inspections may also involve production shutdown.
 Private businesses just learning of CWC implications are concerned
that such visits may compromise confidential business information
and produce significant costs.  
<P>
One medium-size company alerted the Senate that they use over
5,000 different chemicals in their production process of household
products and that the reporting system would impose a significant
administrative burden.  
<P>
Most disconcerting, though, is the claim by foreign policy experts
that rogue countries that harbor chemical weapons are not planning
to sign the treaty.  As non-signatories to the treaty, countries
such as Egypt, Iraq, North Korea, Syria and the Republic of China
will not be bound by CWC's provisions. 
<P>
 At the same time, American businesses will pay a huge price and
suffer real losses for a treaty whose goals cannot be met because
rogue countries will continue to stockpile and produce chemical
weapons.

<center><h2>
Will You Be Required to File Electronically?<BR>
</h2>
by <a href="/sbsc/kerrigan.html">Karen Kerrigan</a>
</center>
<P>
<blockquote>
<hr>
The one thing that annoys business owners about Washington, D.C.
is the fact that they often find out about a new rule or regulation
well after it has been signed into law.  Most recently, thousands
of small and medium-sized businesses have been receiving notices
from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) about a new law passed
under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) which requires
more businesses to start filing their payroll taxes electronically
by January 1, 1997.<BR>

<P>
An unrelated provision to the 1993 NAFTA legislation required
that the federal government build a nationwide Electronic Federal
Tax Payment System (EFTPS) in order to receive federal depository
taxes electronically.  The new program began with 800 of the largest
U.S. businessses on January 1, 1995, and 800 more were added to
the mandated system at the beginning of 1996.  On January 1, 1997,
1.2 million more businesses were slated to become mandated electronic
filers.  That deadline has been extended to July 1, 1997 due to
the efforts of Senator Kit Bond (R-MO), Chairman of the Senate
Small Business Committee, and other business allies on Capitol
Hill.<BR>

<P>
According to phase-in requirements of the IRS' EFTPS, businesses
whose aggregate federal payroll tax deposits exceding $50,000
must begin depositing these taxes electronically.  The IRS began
informing small companies of the requirement with the following
notice: &quot;YOU MUST ENROLL AND DEPOSIT ELECTRONICALLY.&quot;
 To all the recipients of the IRS mailing, the notice came from
out of the blue.<BR>

<P>
When small businesses started complaining to members of Congress
about the surprise notices, Senator Bond and others stepped in
to help those targeted by the fast approaching deadline.  In a
July 24 letter sent to Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and IRS
Commissioner Margaret Richardson, Sen. Bond wrote that many small
busineses did not understand what the IRS notice meant in practical
terms.  Sen. Dale Bumpers (D-AK), ranking minority member of the
committee, co-signed the letter.<BR>

<P>
Senator Bond said that some small businesses in response to the
notices thought that the IRS would start &quot;debiting bank accounts
without taxpayer permission, while others believe that they must
invest in new computer and telephone systems in order to conduct
the transfers.&quot;<BR>

<P>
In another letter to Senator William Roth (R-DE), Chairman of
the Senate Committee on Finance, over thirty business organizations
-- including the American Payroll Association -- expressed concern
that the EFTPS system will not be prepared to handle over 1.3
million new electronic filers.  In addition, the business groups
assert that the IRS is not adequately education those obligated
to electronically file.<BR>

<P>
For example, the letter points out that in a recent meeting of
over 600 Certified Public Accountants held in Boston, not one
of the attendees knew of the mandate.  In addition, a survey city
by the letter confirms that most of the businesses falling under
the next phase-in are unaware of the new filing commitment --
over 70% of &quot;soon-to-be mandated taxpayers are not aware
of these requirements.&quot;  Also, spot calls of IRS district
offices have revealed that the tax-collecting agency's employees
are not even aware of the new requirements.<BR>

<P>
According to Sen. Bond, the need for the IRS to communicate more
effectively with small business taxpayers falls under the Small
Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA) which became
law in March.  Under SBREFA, federal agencies are supposed to
publish regulations in &quot;Plain English&quot; so that small
businesses can comply with the law.<BR>

<P>
Following the various letter writing campaigns to the IRS and
key committee chairman, the IRS published a Legislative Fact Sheet
on July 29.  In that four page summary, the IRS provides an overview
of the EFTPS in a question &amp; answer format.<BR>

<P>
Even so, for some business groups and others opposed to the phase-in
requirement, the new mandate will create a major new cost burden
that will disrupt many businesses.  Also, of the two options offered
by the IRS for electronic payment -- Automated Clearing House
&quot;Credit&quot; or &quot;Debit&quot; -- many small businesses
may not be able to select the credit option because local and
rural banks are not equipped to offer it.<BR>

<P>
Most problematic however is the fact the IRS and the Treasury
Department will not test the system first to determine if it will
properly work.  The business organizations writing to Congress
estimate that about 2 million businesses will be required to enroll
in the system, which means that financial agents will be processing
16,600 enrollments per day.  And if each taxpayer has two questions,
the IRS will be answering about 33,000 inquiries per day.<BR>

<P>
Under the new Small Business Jobs Protections Act passed early
August (the bill that hiked the minimum wage), the January 1997
deadline has been extended to July 1, 1997 so that businesses
can more fully understand how to comply with the new electronic
filing law.  The extension also gives the IRS more time to fully
educated small business, banks, payroll processors, and accountants
about the procedure.<BR>

<P>
Those businesses with less than $50,000 in payroll taxes may want
to take this opportunity to find out more about the requirements
-- 1999 the requirement drops to $20,000.<BR>

<P>
Is the IRS capable of answering questions that hundreds of thousands
of businesses will have about filing electronically, and will
they be prepared to fully implement the program on July 1, 1997?
 According to question #14 on their recent Legislative Update,
if a taxpayer does not understand the enrollment process, form
or instructions, they can call 1-800-555-4477 or 1-800-945-8400.

<h2>Chairman of House Small Business Committee A True
Champion<BR>
</h2>
by <a href="/sbsc/kerrigan.html">Karen Kerrigan</a></center>
<P>
<hr>
<br>
 Recently I had the opportunity to talk with the
Chairman of the House Small Business Committee. The topic was
the accomplishments of the 104th Congress regarding small business
issues.  Chairman Jan Meyers (R-KS) was proud of the record of
the 104th Congress, but expressed frustration with President Clinton
as many of the small business initiatives fell victim to his veto
pen.<BR>
<P>
The frustration stems from the fact that key tax
and regulatory reforms had &quot;enough support to pass both Houses
of Congress.&quot;  In addition, all of the reforms were priorities
that were recommended by the White House Conference on Small Business
-- an event called for by the President.  For example, legislation
to cut capital gains taxes, tort reform, increased expensing for
small businesses, and estate-tax reform, were passed by the House
and Senate (some by large margins with bipartisan majorities)
but rejected by the President.<BR>
<P>
 Meyers identified several reasons why more ground
wasn't won on behalf of small business.  For one, the Republicans
lost the media battle on key issues.  Also, the President portrayed
small business legislation as dangerous and unfair.  &quot;It's
difficult for us to respond to his type of bullypulpit,&quot;
stated Meyers.<BR>
<P>
 Many members of Congress feel that both the press
and the President successfully depicted Republican-led reforms
as &quot;extreme.&quot;  The multi-million dollar ad campaigns
sponsored by organized labor and environmental groups echoed this
theme.<BR>
<P>
 &quot;The tax issue is especially easy to demagogue,&quot;
says Meyers.  The Chairman refers to the fact that it is easy
to communicate in a ten-second sound bite that something &quot;benefits
the rich&quot;  According to Meyers its more difficult to quickly
articulate how cutting capital gains taxes provides job-creating
small businesses with access to capital to help start or grow
their enterprises.<BR>
<P>
Despite some of the criticism that Meyers has for
the President, she's more upbeat than critical and feels that
the Congress has indeed advanced the small business agenda on
Capitol Hill.  For one, she has changed the focus of the Small
Business Committee to actually focus on small business issues.
 The Committee's agenda is not random or personal, but one driven
by the needs of small businesses.<BR>
<P>
 &quot;We went to the small business community to
see what is important to them -- then we went after these issues,&quot;
says Meyers.<BR>
<P>
 Small business owners and various groups in Washington
representing the small business community feel welcome in Rayburn
2359 -- the committee hearing room where all the action takes
place.  Scores of small business owners and entrepreneurs have
been invited to testify before the Committee to deliver their
personal accounts of how they have been impacted by regulation
and taxes, or how they would benefit or possibly be hurt by legislation
before the Congress.<BR>
<P>
 And Meyers is proud that some pieces of legislation
originating in her Committee were signed into law by the President.
 For one, the Regulatory Flexibility Act has been strengthened
to protect small businesses from burdensome regulations.  The
strengthening of the Act will make, &quot;regulatory agencies
look more closely at rules and regulations and their impact on
small businesses before they put them out,&quot; states Meyers.
<BR>
<P>
 Under the leadership of Meyers, the health care
tax credit given to small businesses was increased from 25% to
30% and made permanent.  &quot;It was wrong for small businesses
to come to Congress each year and beg to have this credit extended.
 They couldn't plan for the future,&quot; she says.<BR>
<P>
 The Paperwork Reduction Act was also signed into
law requiring that the federal government reduce the paperwork
burden on Americans by 10% in its first year, and 5% annually
thereafter.<BR>
<P>
 The Committee has jurisdiction over the Small Business
Administration (SBA), and Meyers reports that they have been able
to trim the size of the agency &quot;without taking away a single
program of vital importance to small business.&quot;  The SBA's
budget was trimmed from $800 million to $500 million with its
popular loan programs intact.  The Chairman's goal was to provide
diligent oversight of the SBA loan program to ensure it remains
sound with a relatively low loss rate.<BR>
<P>
 Meyers has served on the Committee since 1985, and
admits that their are tough challenges ahead both for the Congress
and small business.  Earlier this year, she announced her retirement
from Congress and hopes to tackle one more issue before her departure..
 That issue is the SBA's 8(a) program -- a program that awards
contracts to minority-owned business noncompetitively.  Meyers
feels the program is riddled with fraud and abuse, and directly
contradicts the recent <U><I>Adarand</I></U> decision by the Supreme
Court.<BR>
<P>
 Meyers believes that the program began with good
intentions, but is now out of control.  According to Meyers, of
the $4.37 billion awarded in 8(a) contracts, only 9% are awarded
competitively.  The government can save taxpayers over $1 billion
if these contracts were competitively bid.  The Government Accounting
Office (GAO) reports that the 8(a) program has failed to foster
self-sufficiency for its small business participants.  According
to a GAO report, &quot;SBA's success in helping disadvantaged
firms to become self-sufficient and competitive was minimal...many
firms relied on 8(a) contracts and viewed the program an end in
itself.&quot;<BR>
<P>
 Meyers admits that because she has decided to tackle
this issue -- her preference is to abolish the 8(a) program --
she may leave Congress on a controversial note.  But Meyers feels
she has an obligation to address the issue.  &quot; I don't feel
comfortable leaving Congress without addressing this costly problem&quot;
she says.<BR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Whatever note she happens to leave on, the small
business community in Washington is unanimous that Chairman Meyers
has been a champion of small business during the 104th Congress.

<H2>Cost Of Government Makes July 3 A Special Day</H2><br>
by <a href="/sbsc/kerrigan.html">Karen Kerrigan</a></center>
<p>
<hr><p>
<blockquote>
On July 4, the United States celebrates its independence from Britain. On the same day, a Washington-based group says, Americans can celebrate their independence from having just paid their share of the cost of government.
<p>
Americans for Tax Reform, a government watchdog and taxpayer advocacy organization, figures that Americans spend more than half the calendar year working for the government. Cost of Government Day according to ATR, "is the date of the calendar year on which the average American has earned enough gross income to pay off all his or her direct and hidden taxes" - hidden taxes being the cost of regulation.
<p>
AU federal, state and local outlays (taxes plus borrowing) are included in Cost of Government Day. Although much of the public has become familiar with Tax Freedom Day - calculated by the Tax Foundation as the date when the average American's  earnings cover her tax bill - ATR believes it is important to include regulatory costs as well.
<p>
Cost of Government Day is calculated to help people understand the combined cost of the tax and regulatory burden. "The extra money and human resources businesses must spend to comply with regulations is just as much a financial burden on consumers as direct taxes. Regulations are essentially hidden taxes," says ATR President Grover Norquist.
<p>
According to the group, regulations are passed on to the consumer in the  of higher prices. Also, most economists acknowledge that regulatory costs are passed along from employers to employees in the  of lower wages while constraining a business's ability to invest and grow.
<p>
ATR has calculated the cost of government in 1996 at $3.38 trillion. That breaks down to $13,000 for every man, woman and child in America. Of that total, nearly $1 trillion results from federal and state regulation. The federal government alone accounts for more than $739 billion in hidden regulatory costs (more than $2,800 for every man, woman and child in America).
<p>
According to ATR, the total cost of state and local regulations is vastly underestimated because no quantifiable data has been assembled to account for all costs. For example, the costs associated with state and local environmental protection, worker safety and consumer protection are not included.
<p>
The cost of federal regulations, however, has been calculated by Rochester Institute of Technology Professor Thomas D. Hopkins, a leading authority on regulatory costs. Recently Hopkins conducted a study for the U.S. Small Business Administration documenting the impact of regulations on smaller companies. Hopkins found that the average federal regulatory cost per worker in smaller firms is three-quarters higher than for larger businesses.
<p>
And when businesses are surveyed, they consistently bemoan the burdensome nature of regulations. For example:
<ul>
<li>In March, the Center for the Study of American Business at Washington University in St. Louis reported that 52 percent of midsize companies surveyed said government regulation is their biggest challenge.
<li>In a recent survey of small manufacturers conducted by the National Association of Manufacturers, nearly half reported that regulations had prevented their hiring new workers.
<li>The SBA says that small-business owners spend 1 billion hours each year filling out government forms at a cost of $100 billion.
</ul>
Although most surveys have found that Americans believe federal regulations do more harm than good, this sentiment has not translated into a major regulatory overhaul in the federal government.
<p>
In fact, just the opposite has occurred. The Clinton administration's regulatory budget has
grown much faster than federal spending. And between 1989 and 1992 - during the Bush administration - the government burden on small business increased more than 34 percent, according to the House Joint Economic Committee.
<p>
Not only are businesses saddled with higher costs due to increased regulations, but county governments will be forced to spend almost $3 billion by 1998 to comply with mandates imposed by the Americans with Disabilities Act, according to estimates by the National Association of Counties.
<p>
Still, the ATR's Norquist believes Cost of Government Day will eventually roll backward instead of forward.
<p>
"While the new Congress has been attacked by defenders of the status quo for wanting to reform regulations and cut taxes for working families and small businesses, ATR believes we have only seen the beginning of the debate to overhaul the tax system, trim the size of government, and relieve Americans of burdensome regulations."
<p>
The 1996 elections will be a referendum on the size and scope of government, he believes.
<p>
While most Americans will be observing the country's independence on the Fourth of July, ATR hopes they also will observe what the government has cost them on July 3. According to Norquist, being informed is the first step to helping his group move Cost of government Day several days backward each year.

<H2>How Much Do You Pay Uncle Sam Each Week?</H2><br>

<blockquote>
What government costs taxpayers has been well-documented by many groups. And it's beginning to get even more attention.
<p>
According to the Washington-based Tax Foundation, "Tax Freedom Day" fell on May 7 this Year. That date marks the point at which the average American's earnings covered his or her tax bill for the year. "Cost of Government Day," a day calculated by Americans for Tax Reform, goes further by including taxes, regulations and total government spending. According to that group, the average person has not finished paying the government until July 3. Now, a Michigan-based group wants to remind workers how much government costs each pay period by including the information on payroll stubs. The Mackinac Center for Public Policy has developed "The Right to Know Payroll Form" to show workers the cost of government and how these costs translate into less take-home pay.
<p>
For years, watchdog groups have warned that increased regulation and taxation mean employers must pass costs on to employees through lower wages and fewer benefits. The right-to-know form shows how these mandates quickly add up to sizable amounts for each employee.
<p>
"Many workers don't realize the actual cost that government imposes through its spending and regulations. The Right to Know Payroll Form helps citizens become better able to participate in the democratic process because it makes them better informed," said Mackinac Vice President Joseph Overton.
<p>
Beyond the usual pay-stub information of state and federal income tax and Social Security payments, the Right to Know Payroll Form includes:
<ul>
<li>The employer's share of Social Security and Medicare taxes.
<li>The employer's unemployment insurance and workers' compensation costs.
<li>The costs of administering the taxes.
<li>The costs of complying with state and federal personnel-related mandates, such as the Americans With Disabilities Act and Family and Medical Leave Act.
</ul>
Employers are hit with additional regulations from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Internal Revenue Service, the Environmental Protection Agency and other government agencies. So, for most businesses, the right-to-know effort hits only the tip of the regulatory iceberg.
<p>
The business community has responded positively to the Mackinac project. According to Mackinac spokesperson Joseph Lehman, "dozens of private businesses are working to implement the.system right now."
<p>
The center launched their effort on Tax Freedom Day and continues to recruit employers to use the system.
<p>
In addition to employers in the private sector, Mackinac has found an unlikely partner - the state of Michigan. Starting in July, more than 60,000 state employees will receive revised pay stubs documenting how much money it takes to keep them on the payroll.
<p>
The new payroll stubs will include how much the state pays for the employee's share of Social Security and Medicare taxes and the state-paid portion of health insurance and other benefits.
<p>
According to the center, developing the data for a right-to-know form is simple. Beyond the standard payroll deductions shown on the typical pay stub, the form lists all the employer's costs. Such items as the employer's share of payroll taxes per employee, easily quantifiable government mandates and the administrative cost of compliance are included.
<p>
The employer's costs are itemized and deducted from the Estimated Payroll Allocation to produce gross pay. The withholding tax is subtracted from gross pay to produce net pay, just as most payroll forms do now.
<p>
According to the center's brochure promoting the right-to-know program; both employers and employees benefit. 
<p>
Workers understand better how government-imposed mandates affect job creation and growth. Employers understand better how mandates and taxes impact workers' pay.
<p>
For small companies, this is especially critical because they feel more harshly the effects of mandates and taxes.

The Mackinac Center for Public Policy has developed "The Right to Know Payroll Form" to show workers the cost of government and how these costs translate into less take-home pay.
<p>
The Mackinac Center says that workers will benefit from the new pay stub because it shows employees the cost of government programs and mandates.
<p>
For years, watchdog groups lamenting the size and scope of government have warned the public that increased regulation and taxation mean that employers have to pass these costs on to employees through lower wages and fewer benefits. The Right to Know Form breaks down those costs by showing how these mandates quickly add up to sizable amounts per employee.

"Many workers don't realize the actual cost that government imposes through its spending and regulations. The Right to Know Payroll Form helps citizens become better able to participate in the democratic process because it makes them better informed," said Mackinac Vice President Joseph Overton.
<p>
Although pay stubs already show the employee's share of state and federal income tax and Social Security payments, the Right to Know Payroll Form includes other costs. These unseen costs include the employer's share of Social Security and Medicare taxes; the employer's unemployment insurance and workers' compensation costs; the costs of administering such taxes; and the costs of complying with state and federal, personnel-related mandates, such as the Americans With Disabilities Act and Family and Medical Leave Act.
<p>
Employers are hit with additional regulations from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Internal Revenue Service, the Environmental Protection Agency and other government agencies. So for most businesses, the right to know effort only hits the tip of the regulatory iceberg.

<p>
The Mackinac Center launched the effort on Tax Freedom Day and is actively recruiting employers. Although many employers in the private sector have called the center to pledge their adoption of the payroll form, Mackinac has found an unlikely partner - the state of Michigan.
<p>
Starting in July, more than 60,000 employees of the state will receive revised pay stubs, which will document how much is paid to keep them on the payroll. While Michigan did not include all Right to Know Payroll Form recommendations, the new payroll stubs will include how much the state pays for the employee's share of Social Security and Medicare taxes, and the state-paid portion of health insurance and other benefits.
<p>
According to the center, developing the cost data to use for a firm's own right-to-know form is simple. Beyond the standard payroll deductions that are shown on the typical pay stub, the Right to Know form extends payroll accounting to include all the employer's costs. Such items as the employer's share of payroll taxes per employee, easily quantifiable government mandates and the administrative burden of complying with such costs are included.
<p>
Firms participating in the program have used accountants and tax and benefits managers to calculate these costs to determine the average cost per employee. Once the costs are estimated, they are added to the gross pay to produce an Estimated Payroll Allocation.
<p>
On the form, the employer's costs are itemized and deducted from the Estimated Payroll Allocation to produce gross pay. The withholding tax is subtracted from gross pay to produce net pay, just as most payroll forms do now.
<p>
According to the center's brochure promoting the Right to Know program, both employers and employees benefit. Workers will better understand how government-imposed mandates impact job creation and growth.
<p>
Also, employees will better understand how mandates and taxes impact workers' pay. For small firms, this is especially critical as mandates and taxes are more harshly felt by this sector of the economy.

<H2>Wage Hike Won't Help The Poor But Will Hurt Business</H2><br>
by <a href="/sbsc/kerrigan.html">Karen Kerrigan</a></center>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<blockquote>
Who would have thought our nation's small businesses would be facing a mandated increase in their labor costs under a Republican-controlled Congress? President Clinton had the opportunity to push through a minimum-wage increase during his first two years in office, but chose not to.
<p>
But the politics of an election year are shifting into high gear, and each party is looking for ways to shore up its base of support. For the Democrats, an increase in the minimum wage is the perfect way to show the American public that they care about the working class. It also ensures that the labor unions will continue to support the Democrats' campaign to win back control of Congress.
<p>
Increasing the minimum wage will do little to help the working poor in America, but the emotional appeal of the issue obviously benefits the party that is pushing it. To that extent, the Republicans don't want to appear uncaring, so they're working to craft a package they feel will more adequately respond to the needs of the working poor.
<p>
But first, some of the facts regarding who benefits from an increase in the minimum wage:
<ul>
<li> According to the Democratic Leadership Council, a moderate group of Democrats that Clinton once headed, more than 70 percent of minimum-wage workers are in families that are well above the poverty level. Nearly 40 percent of the workers are in families with incomes in the top half of the income distribution.
<li>Of the 1.96 million workers who earned the minimum wage in 1995, 59 percent were 24 years old or younger, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
<li>Analyzing the 12 million workers who make between $4.25 and $5.15 an hour (the proposed new wage), the Employment Policy Institute found that only 9 percent of these workers are married and their families' sole wage earner. Only 3 percent are single parents.
<li> Also, according to Employment Policy Institute, the average wage of minimum-wage workers increases from $4.25 to $6.08 an hour within a year.
</ul>
Wage-hike proponents say that the minimum wage is at a 40-year low. But this declaration, made often by Labor Secretary Robert Reich, compares apples to oranges. Forty years ago, the minimum wage applied mostly to skilled jobs in manufacturing and transportation - restaurant and retail jobs were exempt. Reich and his fellow wage-hike crusaders are essentially comparing the pay of skilled workers yesterday to unskilled workers today.
<p>
Of course, the small-business lobby in Washington is not surprised that it must continue to fight wage-hike proposals. According to an industry representative fighting against the wage increase, "The American public continue to support an increase in the starting wage because it's a feel-good proposal. Unfortunately, most Americans do not understand the harmful effects of artificial wage hikes - they cost jobs and cause price increases for the working poor."
<p>
The Democratic Leadership Council appears to agree. In a recent position paper on the wage increase, the council asserts that "the costs of an increase ... would be borne disproportionately by lower-income families" because they would be forced to pay higher prices. The council calls this a "regressive transfer, making most poor people a little worse off in order to improve the lives, at least for a time, of a group of people that is predominately nonpoor."
<p>
Recognizing this dynamic, one Republican freshman has come up with a creative idea to allow minimum-wage workers to keep more of their pay rather than allowing the government to eat away at their wages.
<p>
Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind., proposes allowing minimum-wage earners to keep the payroll taxes that are currently withheld from their paychecks. McIntosh is calling his increase proposal the Minimum Wage Tax Cut. According to the freshman member, the proposal would increase the take-home pay of those earning the minimum wage without causing the job losses that a government-mandated wage hike would produce. It's estimated that an increase in the minimum wage would cost the economy 300,000 to 500,000 jobs.
<p>
McIntosh's proposal would cut federal taxes for workers earning between $4.25 and $5.25 an hour by allowing them to keep federal income, Social Security and Medicare taxes - now deducted from their paychecks. The proposal would raise workers' net hourly rate to $4.57, compared with the current $3.76 when federal withholdings are deducted.
<p>
"What proponents of raising the minimum wage to $5.15 don't tell you is that after federal taxes are deducted, workers will only take home $4.56 an hour," McIntosh said. "By avoiding government-mandated wages, taxes can be cut for minimum-wage earners and their weekly paychecks will increase," he added.
<p>
Early estimates of the McIntosh proposal by the Congressional Budget Office show that it could cost $8 billion to $10 billion annually. To make up the difference, McIntosh proposed cutting federal welfare by 10 percent, amounting to $9 billion. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the 90-cent wage increase will cost businesses about $12.5 billion over five years.
<p>
But whatever the wage hike will cost the business community, most of the evidence proves that the real losers would be lower-skilled workers who become priced out of the labor market.

<H2>Small Businesses Fighting For Medical Accounts</H2><br>
by <a href="/sbsc/kerrigan.html">Karen Kerrigan</a></center>
<p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>
Another health-care reform battle is brewing on Capitol Hill. But rather than fighting against employer mandates, small-business organizations and their allies are fighting to include medical savings accounts in health-care legislation this year.
<p>
What is an MSA? An employer takes a portion of funds currently spent on health insurance and deposits it into an MSA - up to $2,000 for an individual or $4,000 for a family.
<p>
The money can be used to pay for out-of-pocket medical expenses. Some can be used to purchase a catastrophic policy covering all medical expenses after a deductible is met. And, at the end of the year, the insured can keep any unused MSA funds.
<p>
This provides an incentive for the insured to shop around for healthcare needs - injecting much-needed competition into an industry in which the third-party payment system has left the consumer with no incentive to spend less.
<p>
Under the Health Coverage Availability and Affordability Act of 1996 passed by the House of Representatives, individuals and the self-employed could deduct from their federal taxes 100 percent of the funds deposited in their MSAs. This would be in addition to the 35 percent of a catastrophic policy premium they are already allowed to deduct.
<p>
This feature, say MSA advocates, would make individual taxes fairer in comparison to what corporations pay. And tax equity, combined with the portability feature, would help
solve the "job-lock" problem experienced by so many Americans who want to change jobs.
<p>
The Kennedy-Kassebaum bill in the Senate does not include an MSA provision. Key Democrats have said MSAs were too controversial to include, and they are aggressively working to make sure that MSAs are kept out.
<p>
MSAs have long been supported by small business. At the White House Conference on Small Business in June 1995, the adoption of MSAs was a key recommendation delegates sent to the president and Congress. In fact, it's estimated that nearly 3,000 businesses - mostly small and medium - are currently using an MSA prototype.
<p>
Evidence reveals that MSAs help reduce health-insurance costs for businesses, while giving employees greater physician choice and control over health-care spending.
<p>
That's why MSA supporters are baffled at flip flops-taken by politicians who have been long-time supporters. In particular, minority leaders Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., in the House and Tom Daschle, D-S.D., in the Senate are leading the charge against MSAs, despite the fact that both were champions of MSAs in the previous Congress.
<p>
Less than two years ago, when asked about the prospect of MSAs being included in health-care reform, Gephardt responded, "Absolutely. This is an idea the Ways and Means Committee has worked-on for three or four years. It's very popular . . . I think it's a great option."
<p>
In fact, MSAs unanimously passed the Ways and Means Committee in the last Congress. Every member of the committee, with the exception of one Democrat, voted for them. In the current Congress MSAs were included in the bipartisan balanced-budget package sent to President Clinton, which he subsequently vetoed.
<p>
Just recently, Sen. Daschle referred to MSAs as the "Dr. Kevorkians of health reform, but in the last Congress he cosponsored the Medical Cost Containment Act of 1992, which according to the legislation, "would allow employers to provide their employees with an annual allowance in a Medical Care Savings Account to pay for routine health-care needs."
<p>
MSA advocates say the flip-flops exhibited by Daschle and Gephardt smack more of partisan politics than a newfound skepticism of MSAs.
<p>
"This is what the American people hate about Washington," said Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, a longtime advocate of MSAs.
<p>
"Because some Democrats view this as a simple case of Republicans getting credit for a popular reform, they are stonewalling with the hope of receiving some sort of partisan gain," Norquist added.
<p>
With recent reports showing that proposals like Kennedy-Kassebaum have been an abysmal failure in states that have enacted similar reforms - such as the total collapse of the health-insurance system in Washington state - antics on Capitol Hill to kill MSAs may backfire.
<p>
According to MSA advocates, a grassroots revolution is brewing in favor of the reform, especially among small businesses and the self-employed. Indeed, President Clinton is attempting to reach out to constituencies that he has not been too popular with in the past. The support of MSAs may be one of those issues he finally embraces.

<H2>'A-Corps' Plan Would Hobble Small Business</H2><br>
by <a href="/sbsc/kerrigan.html">Karen Kerrigan</a></center>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<blockquote>
Democrats and Republicans are both marketing themselves as job creators and wage boosters, placing American business at the center of their policy prescriptions. Their proposed solutions, though, are ideological opposites.
<p>
To Republicans, the key to robust economic growth, higher wages and more jobs lies in providing businesses with significant tax and regulatory relief.
<p>
Their solutions also include giving individuals the widest options available for obtaining financial security, education and training, and benefits such as health care through the equalization of tax benefits.
<p>
Democrats believe American business won't help workers on its own and that the federal government must provide the incentives to encourage business to do so.
<p>
According to Secretary of Labor Robert Reich, "If we want companies to do things which do not necessarily improve the returns to shareholders, but which are beneficial for the economy and society as a whole . . . we have to give business an economic reason to do so."
<P>
But rather than provide all businesses with across-the-board tax and regulatory relief, proposals being offered by Reich and Democratic leaders in the House and Senate would reduce taxes and regulations only for companies that achieve "certain minimum requirements."
<p>
Democratic Sen. Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico, chairman of the Senate Task Force on High Wage Jobs, recently released a package of proposals aimed at alleviating economic insecurity and wage stagnation.
<p>
The report, titled "Scrambling to Pay the Bills: Building Allies for American Working Families," would provide businesses with favorable tax and regulatory treatment if they meet certain tests established by the federal government.
<p>
"A-Corps" businesses would be required, for example, to meet some of the following standards: 
<ul>
<li>Contribute an amount equal to at least 3 percent of payroll to pension plans.
<li>Commit an amount equal to at least 2 percent of payroll for employee training.
<li>Offer all U.S. employees a health-care plan approved by the government. Employers would have to pay at least 50 percent of the plan's cost.
<li>Give employees the option of participating in a profit-sharing, stock option or stock ownership plan. An employee-elected trustee would manage the plan.
<li>Place caps on compensation for the chief executive officer and other employees.
<li>Make sure at least 90 percent of plant and equipment purchases, and employment costs resulting from product and service production, delivery and consumption in the United States occurred in the United States.
<li>Meet or exceed all occupational, safety and environmental standards.
<li>Pay dues and belong to an industry association approved by the Department of Commerce.
</ul>
Businesses meeting the criteria would be given a favorable tax rate, their current corporate income tax replaced with a "business activities tax." Under a BAT plan, payments companies make to other businesses, including the purchase of new equipment and plant construction, are subtracted from taxable income. Only imports would be taxed.
<p>
A-Corps participants would receive a lower tax rate than nonparticipating businesses, though the proposal doesn't specify what those rates might be. However, under the BAT system, small businesses with gross annual receipts of $100,000 would be exempted from the tax.
<p>
In terms of regulatory relief for A-Corps participants, businesses would still be required to meet all federal laws, but could get quicker review and decision-making from federal agencies; participate in voluntary compliance programs; and take advantage of safe-harbor provisions from certain regulatory requirements.
<p>
Qualified A-Corps companies would also be given special treatment in bidding on government contracts.
<p>
Critics of Bingaman and Reich's approach charge that the "most-favored" corporate method is flawed in that businesses could not possibly participate in the A-Corps program without giving up control to the federal government.
<p>
In addition, they say, the proposal assumes businesses do not value workers - a predisposition that runs counter to reality. An economic policy update issued recently by the Senate Joint Economic Committee contends the "corporate responsibility" proposals would "make workers more dependent on their current employers at a time when public policy should be encouraging individual responsibility through upward mobility and portable benefits."
<p>
In addition, the IEC report argues that these policies would discriminate against small businesses and the self-employed.
<p>
According to the report, "because [small businesses] need to invest in building the business, they're less likely to have the free cash to spend on 'corporate responsibility.'
<p>
Also, says the study, a more prudent course would focus tax benefits on individuals, whether or not they receive health insurance, pension plans and worker training from their employers or elsewhere in the marketplace.
<p>
The best way to help the economy and individuals would be to expand individual retirement accounts, make pensions truly portable by allowing individuals the same tax benefits as company-sponsored plans, enact medical savings accounts and lower the marginal tax rates for all.
<p>
As Democrats and Republicans on the campaign trail and in Washington struggle to articulate their competing messages to the American people, small businesses already know what needs to be done to allow their businesses to grow and succeed. Entrepreneurs need help competing against global competitors.

<H2>Finally, Congress Moves To Limit Tax Increases</H2><br>
by <a href="/sbsc/kerrigan.html">Karen Kerrigan</a></center>
<p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
Most analysts agree that reviving tax cuts is a political nonstarter this year. Congress approved a balanced-budget package coupled with tax cuts for small business, but it stopped short at President Clinton's desk.
<p>
With April 15 fast approaching millions of small business owners and taxpayers look at the annual ritual with anger and frustration. But certain members of Congress are banding together to make sure that raising taxes will be just as difficult as cutting them.
<p>
On April 15, the House of Representatives will vote on a Tax Limitation Amendment to the Constitution that would require a two-thirds majority vote of each house of Congress to increase taxes. The effort is being led by Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, along with a bipartisan group of House members including Pete Geren, D-Texas; Ralph Hall, D-Texas; and John Shadegg, R-Ariz.
<p>
On the same day, the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Federalism and Property Rights will hold hearings on a companion resolution to the tax-limiting amendment, introduced by Sen. Jon Kyle, R-Ariz.
<p>
Proponents of the amendment contend a constitutional requirement is absolutely necessary to protect taxpayers from the unending tax increases that followed the adoption of the 16th Amendment in 1913. Before the 16th Amendment was enacted, no income tax was allowed. Since then, federal tax collections have climbed more than 175,000 percent.
<p>
Tax-limitation amendments are not untested. Already, 28 states have some form. Ten have adopted the majority legislative vote to approve higher taxes, and one-third of states require more than a majority, according to Americans for Tax Reform.
<p>
Studies have shown clearly the effect of higher taxes on economic growth. A 1993 study by the Joint Economic Committee of Congress tracking state economies during 1989 to 1993 found:
<ul>
<li>The top 10 income tax-increasing states lost nearly 200,000 jobs from 1989 to 1993. The top 10 income tax-reducing states created nearly 1 million.
<li>Unemployment rose by 2.3 percent in the states that increased taxes the most, but only by .3 percent in the income tax-cutting states.
<li>Income per family of four fell by an average of $600 in the tax-increasing states, and rose $150 in the top 10 tax-cutting states.
</ul>
Tax increases are especially hard for the small-business, entrepreneurial sector, which the United States depends on for creating jobs.
<p>
The 1993 tax hike, for example, was sold as a plan to soak the rich but the majority of those affected were small businesses. A 1994 Small Business Survival Committee survey found that 28 percent of respondents raised prices, 26 percent postponed expansion plans, 14 percent terminated one employee, and 9 percent were forced to take two of the actions.
<p>
Tax-limiting proponents say the 1993 tax hike never would have made it into the history books if the two-thirds majority requirement had been in place. The increase passed by only one vote in the House and Senate.
<p>
According to Americans for Tax Reform four of the last five tax increases were passed with less than a two-thirds majority. They added $666 billion to the tax bill of American taxpayers.
<p>
Does a tax limitation requirement have the support of the public? In 1992, a National Taxpayer's Union Foundation survey found that 78 percent of respondents favored "a constitutional amendment that would- limit the growth of federal taxes."
<p>
More recently, delegates to the 1995 White House Conference on Small Business recommended to the president and Congress that a two-thirds majority requirement be adopted.
<p>
Taxpayers may want to tune into C-SPAN April 15 to see which members of Congress argue to limit increases and which members argue for unlimited power to dig deeper into their pockets.

<H2>Immigration Reform Taking Center Stage</H2><br>
by <a href="/sbsc/kerrigan.html">Karen Kerrigan</a></center>
<p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
If anyone forgot that the immigration issue is emotionally charged, Republican presidential hopeful Pat Buchanan is aggressively reminding America about the issue's volatility.
<p>
Among other measures, Buchanan proposes to erect some type of stronghold along the southern border of the United States and impose a five-year moratorium on legal immigration.
<p>
Congress, meanwhile, is prepared to take action on immigration reform legislation, and the business lobby in Washington is gearing up to oppose provisions that would put employers at the center of enforcing the nation's immigration laws.
<p>
American Business for Legal Immigration - which was formed to protect legal employment immigration - recently held a press conference in Washington to announce its opposition to Wyoming Republican Sen. Alan Simpson's immigration proposal, the Immigration Reform Act of 1995. Simpson's legislation calls for the following:
<ul>
<li>A 35 percent cut in business-related immigration each year, equating to a reduction of 50,000 employment-based visas (from 140,000 to 90,000);
<li>requiring employers who hire legal immigrants to subsidize training programs for U.S. workers;
<li>new taxes - each employer would be required to pay either $10,000 or 10 percent of the foreign worker's annual compensation package (whichever is higher) to the U.S. government;
<li>more regulations, restrictions and paperwork.
</ul>
Simpson's bill attempts to tackle both illegal and legal immigration reform in one sweeping measure. But ABLI contends that it is misguided to combine the two issues, blurring the distinction between the value that skilled legal immigrants bring to the U.S. economy versus a different set of concerns Americans have with illegal immigration.
<p>
"Although Simpson's proposal does seek to address the issue of illegal immigration in the U.S., it confuses legal and illegal immigration and unreasonably threatens the competitiveness of American business in today's global marketplace," says ABLI Director Jennifer Eisen. ABLI strongly supports differentiating between the problems posed by illegal immigration and the benefits of legal immigration.
<p>
ABLI members defend their need to search for and hire skilled talent where they can find it to boost U.S. competitiveness. The coalition also contends that in a highly competitive global economy, it is unrealistic for U.S. policy leaders to attempt to hinder and micromanage employer personnel decisions on top of the current requirements in the legal immigration system.
<p>
According to Kirby Dyess, corporate vice president of Intel Corp., his company already wades through six inches of government forms to comply with regulations and paperwork for each foreign professional it hires. The cost per employee is approximately $7,000 to $10,000. "We don't go through all of this time and expense to displace U.S. workers," Dyess says.
<p>
Harris Miller, president of the Information Technology Association of America, agrees with Dyess. Miller explains that the overhead costs associated with hiring a foreign worker today are sufficient to make it the last resort for most employers. As a result, the current ceiling for business visas is not being reached. ABLI says that employers use about 93,000 of the 140,000 employment-based visas available.
<p>
ABLI also asserts that legal immigrants stimulate domestic job growth by bringing much-needed expertise, technological skill and patented concepts to the nation's industries and economy. Innovations by legal immigrants have propelled American companies to new successes and have allowed these companies to capitalize on new product inventions and technologies.
<p>
ABLl and its members agree that illegal immigration is a problem that must be addressed. Although efforts to split the legislation to address legal and illegal immigration may win out, the business lobby is also concerned about provisions that attempt to stop illegal immigration.
<p>
For example, both House and Senate legislation include proposals to put into place a centralized employment verification system operated by the federal government. Employers would be required to call a government toll-free number to identify the worker as eligible and give the prospective employee's Social Security number.
<p>
During this big political year, politicians and U.S. presidential hopefuls are reacting to hot emotional issues. But quick and rash policy prescriptions for the nation's illegal immigration problem could end up hurting the U.S. economy more than it will help if both legal and illegal immigration are "reformed" in one sweeping measure.

<H2>OSHA Reforms Winding Through Congress</H2>
<p><br>
by <a href="/sbsc/kerrigan.html">Karen Kerrigan</a></center>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<blockquote>
Despite the first session of the 104th Congress marking a historic change in the direction of the federal government, far-reaching legislative initiatives have been stalled by the ideological and procedural differences in the House and Senate.
<p>
The House can successfully boast of many tax, regulatory and fiscal reforms it passed in 1995. But without-similar action in the Senate, Congress can't claim a long list of legislative accomplishments, which provide the conventional yardstick by which the media and public measure a productive Congress.
<p>
As Congress-bashers contend that a "do nothing" Congress is the best kind, political analysts predict that President Clinton may exploit Congress' record and pull a page out of campaign history books in his attempts to secure a second term in the White House.
<p>
Just as Harry Truman ran successfully against a "do-nothing" Congress in 1948, President Clinton is considering that strategy in 1996. The "do-nothing" label is something Congress will try to avoid, so congressional leaders are taking a second look at their unfinished 1995 agenda.
<p>
Plenty of opportunities exist to pass meaningful tax and regulatory reforms without stirring up too much of a special-interest hornets' nest. The re-evaluation, say observers, will match targeted legislative opportunities with 1996 political realities.
<p>
OSHA reform is one such area where Congress may accept modest legislative gains. The President and Congress agree that the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) needs to be reformed. Differences arise, of course, when the degree of reform is discussed.
<p>
Republican Rep. Cass Ballenger of North Carolina proposed an OSHA reform bill last year in the House, and it appears that the Senate may soon act on a lighter version of his bill.
<p>
Republican Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas is resurrecting the reform effort in the Senate, with Sens. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., and Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., taking lead roles through co-sponsorship of S.R. 1423, the Occupational Safety and Health Reform and Reinvention Act.
<p>
"Since OSHA was created 25 years ago, the agency has expanded its authority far beyond the original intent of Congress," Hutchison said. "As a result, companies must worry about compliance with standards and regulations that have little or nothing to do with real safety issues."
<p>
S.R. 1423 strives to address real safety issues instead of penalizing business owners for paperwork violations and minor infractions.
<p>
The costs of these so called violations can add up to big fines, as one small roofing company in Houston learned.
<p>
The company was fined 23 times for a total of $13,000 for the following violations: A cut in the insulation of an extension cord that was no longer in use, a bent rung on the bottom of a ladder and a splintered handle on a discarded shovel.
<p>
The Senate reform bill redirects OSHA's energy to consultation programs and voluntary compliance. The bill would codify the Voluntary Protection Program, which exempts employers from general inspections if they have excellent safety and health records.
<p>
There would also be a reduction in penalties for nonserious violations (for example, nonserious hazard citations would be lowered from $7,000 to $100), and penalties waived for nonsignificant violations. Warnings would be issued in lieu of citations, and OSHA inspector quotas would be prohibited.
<p>
Employees would be encouraged (not required) to complain to their employer before they call OSHA. Employee involvement in safety committees is also encouraged through federal labor law modifications.
<p>
Most critically for business, the bill recommends that the employer should not be held responsible if a trained employee disregards health and safety rules.
<p>
OSHA itself has recognized the need to change.
<p>
If there is general agreement on basic principles, is it possible that an OSHA reform bill could move through both houses of Congress and on to the president for his signature?
<p>
Perhaps, but organized labor could deal a blow to even minor reform efforts. Labor unions are opposed to OSHA tinkering, which puts the president in a pickle if a reform bill makes its way through both chambers of Congress. The president is dependent on labor's support and big money for the '96 election.
<p>
Signing an OSHA reform bill backed by the majority of Congress could prove to the electorate and small businesses that the president indeed is governing like a "New Democrat." There's a good chance, though, that election-year friends like the "Old Democrat" much better.

<p>
If you ask most small-business owners, every politician talks a good game of making our
nation's tax system less burdensome. The immense task of overhauling the system, though, keeps most politicians talking. Tax reform is again taking center stage, and perhaps in the near future, tax system overhaul may actually become a reality.
<p>
Many small businesses agree with Republican presidential hopeful Steve Forbes when he says we need to "drive a stake" through the current tax system.
<p>
The small-business sector - responsible for most of the dynamic growth in the economy - fares the worst under the current system. Not only do high taxes inhibit small business growth and job creation, but compliance costs can be financially draining.
<p>
According to a 1991 Tax Foundation report, small companies spent at least $382 in compliance costs for every $100 paid in taxes.
<p>
In addition, it's estimated that businesses squander 3.4 billion hours in tax-related paperwork. And the cost of compliance is big business; more than $200 billion is spent on complying with tax laws.
<p>
Forbes advocates a "pure" flat tax, while . Dole's vision of reform is a "fairer and simpler" type of system.
<p>
Bold tax reform efforts received a big boost from an economic soul mate of Forbes. Jack Kemp, chairman of the National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform, released a long-awaited report whose aim is to help guide and shape the debate to overhaul the system. With such high-profile attention given to the issue, tax reform is destined to become a major election-year issue.
<p>
Kemp's Tax Reform Commission begins the report by recommending to Congress and the president "that the current Internal Revenue Service Code be repealed in its entirety."
<p>
No mincing of words there. The principles guiding the new tax code would have to stand up to the TRC "tax test:"
<p><ul>
<li>Economic growth through incentives to work, save and invest;
<li> fairness for all taxpayers;
<li> neutrality that lets people and not government make choices;
<li> visibility to let people know the cost of government;
<li> stability so people can plan for the future.
</ul>
The TRC advocates that the "failed system" be replaced with a single low rate, taxing income only once with a generous personal exemption and full deductibility of the payroll tax.
<p>
The TRC stops short of advancing one type of tax system over another and does not suggest what the single low tax rate might be. (Forbes suggests a 17 percent rate starting at income above $36,800 for a family of four - below that income level, no taxes would be owed.)
<p>
To end the current tax code bias of rewarding consumption over saving and investing, the report says that the tax system "either must let savers deduct their saving or exclude the returns on the saving from their taxable income. It must also end double-taxation of businesses and their owners and permit expensing of investment outlays."
<p>
The report also recommends that capital gains taxes be abolished. Although the commission recognizes that estate and gift taxes make "little sense," it does not call for the elimination of such taxes, which prove particularly burdensome for family owned businesses.
<p>
The commission strongly endorses full deductibility of payroll taxes for employers and employees. If federal payroll taxes are tax-deductible, taxes would be determined on a worker's real net income.
<p>
Once a tax rate is set into place, the commission recommends that a two-thirds majority vote in Congress be required to raise taxes. For most tax reform advocates, this is critically important. As the law now stands, it only takes a majority vote in Congress to raise taxes and a supermajority to lower them.
<p>
Although many business organizations cheered the results of the TRC recommendations, most concluded that the real work lies ahead. The commission's report is not long on details, and the political realities of implementing such reforms depend on whether those in public office in 1997 will defend the current tax system by tinkering around the edges or totally dismantling it.

<h2>Small-Business Agenda Faces an Uphill Battle</h2>
by <a href="/sbsc/kerrigan.html">Karen Kerrigan</a></center>
<P>
<hr><P>



What happened to the year of small business?  In 1995, the 104th Congress 
championed a legislative agenda to foster entrepreneurship and small-business growth.  But 
advancing small-business legislation proved to be more difficult than most Washington observers 
expected.  Many of the issues that were priorities of the small business lobby were labeled by the 
Clinton administration as giveaways to the rich or special breaks for big business.<p>
For example, efforts to reduce capital gains and estate taxes have been decried as 
benefitting a special few.<p>
And legislation that would have made federal government regulators more accountable to 
small business has been portrayed as a legislative license for big corporations to pollute the 
environment.<p>
Even when Congress and President Clinton eventually sign off on a budget agreement, 
incentives that were specifically targeted for small business will be vastly watered down or 
tossed aside in the name of compromise.<p>
What can small businesses and entrepreneurs expect from Congress and the Clinton 
administration in 1996?<p>
Election years tend to produce a stale legislative environment so the answer may very 
well be "not that much."  On the other hand, the president may attempt to solidify his traditional 
base of support during the election year by offering proposals that translate into votes at the 
ballot box in November.<p>
For example, the president's inclusion of a federal minimum wage increase in his budget 
plan represents an olive branch to labor unions, which view the administration's stand on labor 
issues as weak.<p>
In Congress, business proponents  --  mostly Republicans  --  will continue to advance 
issues popular with the small business community.  Important matters to small businesses, such 
as overhauling the nation's tax system as well as tax and regulatory reform in general, will 
continue to generate scores of congressional hearings and legislative proposals in Capitol Hill.<p>
When push comes to shove, though, will small business see substantive reforms?<p>
The Small Business Survival Foundation recently revisited the agenda set forth by nearly 
1,800 small business delegates at the June 1995 White House Conference on Small Business.  
The following is an update on the top five recommendations that came out of that conference:<p>
<b>Issue No 1:</b> Independent Contractor Clarification.  Most small businesses believe the 
IRS's 20-factor test to determine the employment status of independent contractors is too 
subjective.<p>
  Republican Jon Christensen of Nebraska introduced legislation to clarify the definition 
of independent contractors and streamline the current 20-factor test to only three criteria.<p>To date, the House Ways and Means Committee has not acted on the legislation, and the 
administration has opposed efforts to simplify the 20-factor test.  However, Christensen's efforts 
are expected to receive a hearing by the powerful tax-writing committee in the near future.<p>
<b>Issues No 2:</b> Meal and Entertainment Deduction. Conference delegates called upon 
Congress and the president to enact legislation allowing a 100 percent tax deduction for meals 
and entertainment.  Recent tax laws reduced the deduction to 50 percent.  Although the 100 
percent deduction may be a priority of small  business, it ranks low as an action item in 
Congress.  Politically, the issue would be a ripe target for opponents, who will label it as just 
another perk for the wealthy.<p>
<b>Issue No 3:</b> Regulatory Flexibility Act/Regulatory Reform.  Small business wants federal 
regulatory agencies to determine the costs of their proposed rules and regulations on the small 
business sector.  Amending the Regulatory Flexibility Act, as recommended by conference 
delegates, would increase the likelihood that cost-impact studies are done by regulators.<p>
The act, combined with a host of other regulatory reforms, passed the House but has 
stalled in the Senate.  Most observers believe all efforts to reform the regulatory system are dead 
for 1996.  Clinton has called the House measures, and similar legislation in the Senate, "too 
extreme."<p>
<b>Issue No 4:</b> Repeal the Federal Estate Tax. Family owned businesses are especially hard 
hit by high estate and gift taxes.  Many businesses fail to make it to the next generation due to the 
burdensome nature of such taxes.  Conference delegates overwhelmingly voted to repeal these 
taxes.  The estate-tax issue has become political fodder for class-warfare rhetoric. Even minor 
efforts to increase the estate-tax exemption from $600,000 to $750,000 have been vastly watered 
down.  The Clinton administration opposes abolishing estate and gift taxes but some estate tax 
relief will probably make it to a final budget deal.<p>
<b>Issue No 5 (tie): </b>Superfund Reform and Health-Care Reform: Many small businesses get 
trapped in what is known as the Superfund web, held liable for expensive government 
environmental cleanup schemes when their actions were legal at the time they disposed of waste.  <p>
Republican Mike Oxley of Ohio has introduced legislation to reform Superfund, but the 
bill does not repeal retroactive liability before 1987  --  a key component sought by reform 
proponents.  Even if a weak bill makes it to the president, he would likely veto the legislation.  <p>
The No. 1 reform on the health-care wish list was the adoption of tax-deductible medical 
savings accounts.  MSAs are included in the budget plan passed by Congress but are opposed by 
the Clinton administration.  Supporters believe that MSAs will probably be part of a final budget 
agreement. <p>
Conference delegates also called for the 100 percent tax deductibility of health care costs.  Small businesses will most likely see an increase to 50 percent phased in over a seven-
year period.<p>
On an optimistic note, at least small businesses won't have to ward off major proposals 
that increase their taxes or regulatory burden.  The only redflag is the President's proposal to 
raise the minimum wage.  A threat perhaps, but the small business lobby has become too 
powerful to allow this to happen.

<h2>Rhetoric throttles aid for small businesses</h2>
by Karen Kerrigan
<P>
</center>
<hr><P>
While some people would have you believe otherwise,
the small-business provisions within the Contract With America
amounted to only minor changes.  Now, even the small-scale tax
and regulatory reforms proposed within the contract have been
watered down.
<P>
Many of the contract's key provisions, such as regulatory relief
and legal reform, have either died in the Senate or have been
put on the back burner until after the protracted budget battle.
<P>
Special-interest groups opposed to tax and budget cuts, as well
as reforms that would make bureaucrats more accountable, have
painted the contract as extreme.  Labor unions alone have pumped
more than $2 million into media ads to decry proposals that &quot;drastically
cut&quot; Medicare and pare back safeguards that protect worker
safety and the environment.
<P>
Medicare reform is a perfect example of how the public has swallowed
distorted ad campaigns without checking the facts.  According
to a recent survey by Public Opinion Strategies, most Americans
are woefully misinformed about the basic facts regarding Medicare
reform proposals.
<P>
Under the GOP plan, Medicare's budget would undergo a slower rate
of growth in spending than under current law.  In fact, if Medicare
reform were left up to the 1,000 Americans who responded to the
Public Opinion Strategies survey, reform opponents would have
had a severe problem on their hands.
<P>
For example, when it was explained that the GOP plan would increase
spending for Medicare by 45 percent over the next seven years
--- twice the projected rate of inflation --- 80 percent of those
polled believed the increase was too high.
<P>
The GOP plan increases spending per recipient from $4,800 to $7,100
over the next seven years.  But when asked what they thought the
GOP plan would do, 27 percent said that the plan would cut spending
below $4,000; 24 percent said spending would remain the same;
and only 22 percent most accurately portrayed the plan --- that
it would increase spending per recipient.
<P>
The problem, according to Medicare reform supporters, is that
the American public has been consistently exposed to misleading
ads and political rhetoric.
<P>
According to Pam Bailey, president of the Healthcare Leadership
Council and co-chair of the Coalition to Save Medicare, President
Clinton's plan was not very different from the GOP's.  Under the
plan approved by Congress, the government would spend $1.65 trillion
on Medicare over seven years.  Under the president's plan, it
would spend $1.682 trillion.
<P>
Political rhetoric can be blamed for the demise of many tax and
regulatory changes that would have benefited millions of small
businesses.   Interest groups supportive of the status quo were
quick to distort Republican proposals, which were supported by
many Democrats as well, as giveaways to big business.
<P>
Sure, big companies would have marginally benefited from the changes
proposed by Republicans.  But small businesses would have been
the main beneficiaries.
<P>
Small businesses will see <I>some</I> tax relief and incentives
soon, but according to most small-business groups, the results
are a big disappointment compared with original expectations.
 Small businesses can probably expect a $25,000 expensing provision,
a capital gains tax reduction and targeted estate tax relief for
family-owned businesses.  The final agreement, however, will mandate
that the tax provisions be phased in over seven years.
<P>
Home office users can say goodbye to efforts this year to clarify
the home-office deduction.  But on a more positive note, the self-employed
will see an increase from 30 percent to 50 percent in the amount
they can deduct for health-care expenses (phased in over seven
years).
<P>
Distortion and political rhetoric may help guardians of the status
quo avoid passing reforms that put the country back on a track
of fiscal stability, while helping millions of small business
owners and entrepreneurs create jobs.  But for these millions
of small business owners, the truth is generally reflected in
their bottom lines, which the government plays a big part in helping
or hindering.

<title>Kerrigan:  Balanced budget means bottom-line gains -- SBSC

<h2>Balanced budget means bottom-line gains</h2>
by Karen Kerrigan
<P>
</center>
<hr><P>
 &quot;Balanced budget means bottom-line gains&quot;
Will balancing the federal budget have a real
impact on our economy, or is it merely a populist issue that picks
up votes at the ballot box?
<P>
As Congress and President Clinton bicker over the details of a
seven-year plan to balance the budget, recent public opinion figures
still show widespread support for the effort.
<P>
An early November survey conducted by Alexandria-based Public
Opinion Strategies showed 83 percent of 1,000 registered voters
said it was important to balance the federal budget in the next
seven years.
<P>
At the same time, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin was predicting
wholesale chaos in the financial markets if Congress didn't increase
the federal debt limit.  But 69 percent of those surveyed said
the debt limit should not be increased without a balanced budget
in place.
<P>
Of course, the November deadline passed, Congress and the White
House reached a temporary agreement to re-open government after
a brief shutdown, the country's debt obligations are being paid
and the financial markets appear robust as ever.
<P>
In the end, you may ask:  Does a balanced budget really matter?
 And more importantly, how will a balanced federal budget affect
the livelihood of American families, businesses and individuals?
<P>
A recent crop of economic reports has concluded that balancing
the federal budget will have broad economic benefits and tangible
bottom-line gains for families, individuals and almost all sectors
of the American economy.
<P>
Economists at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank
in Washington, conclude that GOP plan to balance the budget --
with tax cuts -- will lead to greater business investment, higher
earnings per hour and faster economic growth than under current
law.
<P>
Heritage economists found the following would occur  with a balanced
budget in place:
<UL>
<LI>Gross Domestic Product would grow by $10.8 billion more than
under current law in the year 2002;
<LI>there would be an additional $32.1 billion in real disposable
income from 1995 through 2002;
<LI>there would be an additional $66.2 billion in consumption
expenditures from 1995 through 2002;
<LI>there would be an additional $88.2 billion in real non-residential
fixed investment from 1995 through 2002;
<LI>there would be and additional 104,000 housing starts from
1995 through 2002;
<LI>there would be a decrease of .4 percent in the conventional
mortgage rate --- meaning that a homeowner would save about $10,000
over the life of a $100,000, 30-year mortgage;
<LI>auto sales would increase by 600,000 units over the next seven
years --- that's $10 billion worth of cars.
</UL>


<P>
Another report has more good news.
<P>
With the government taking a smaller bite out of the economy,
interest rates should fall dramatically, according to the Senate
Joint Economic Committee.
<P>
A report from the Committee showed that a typical American family
could save nearly $1,800 a year in loan payments if the Republican
plan to balance the budget passes.
<P>
For example, a family with a $75,000 mortgage, a $15,000 auto
loan and an $11,000 student loan could save $1,800 a year if interest
rates drop just one percentage point.
<P>
The national debt of all consumer borrowing for home mortgages
and auto debt is $4.8 trillion --- a 1 percentage point drop in
interest rates would save more than $48 billion per year.
<P>
&quot;Clearly, the benefits of a balanced budget would extent
to all Americans,&quot; says Grover Norquist, president of Americans
for Tax Reform.  With the public still on the side of balancing
the budget, observers believe that the President will accept most
elements of the Republican plan.

<title>Kerrigan:  Are union leader's tactics too divisive? -- SBSC
</title>
</HEAD>

<i>November 1995</i>
<hr>
<h2>Are union leader's tactics too divisive?</h2>
by Karen Kerrigan
<P>

</center><hr><P>
The power wielded by labor unions has deteriorated
in recent years.  Even labor officials admit their political clout
is not what it used to be.
<P>
Lower membership combined with labor officials' inability to aggressively
advance their agenda has caused severe rifts within the labor
movement.  These same factors led to the unprecedented election
of a new AFL-CIO president and probably will lead to more aggressive
organizing strategies.
<P>
On Oct. 25, John Sweeney - then president of the Service Employees
International Union (SEIU) --- defeated acting federation leader
Thomas Donahue for the AFL-CIO presidency.
<P>
Sweeney's win marked a historic moment for the AFL-CIO; his run
for the presidency was the only contested election in the federation's
40-year history.
<P>
As head of the SEIU, Sweeney increased its membership by 37 per
cent.  The SEIU under Sweeney also enjoyed a reputation for effective
organizing and activism --- points labor sees as critical to rebuilding
its political clout.
<P>
While Sweeney's performance at SEIU was striking in comparison
to other unions' activity, the methods used to bolster both its
membership and effectiveness have been questioned not only by
those who were the target of its tactics, but fellow union heads
as well.
<P>
During and after his election, Sweeney forcefully stated that
he will embrace civil disobedience and militancy &quot;if necessary.&quot;
 Sweeney found it necessary to use such tactics at the SEIU and,
based on his past success using such methods, is expected to employ
militant activism at the AFL-CIO.  Sweeney will also have a bigger
budget to work with.
<P>
While most unions spend about 5 percent of their budget on organizing
activities, the SEIU spends five times that amount.  Sweeney promised
to do the same at the AFL-CIO and committed $20 million of its
budget to union organizing efforts.
<P>
In addition to a strategy of funneling money directly to local
unions, Sweeney's goal is to train 1,000 union organizers over
the next two years to assist AFL-CIO members nationwide.
<P>
Metropolitan areas already have a taste for Sweeney's brand of
activism, and union watchers warn that businesses, as well as
local governments, should prepare for this larger campaign of
&quot;in your face&quot; activity.
<P>
For example, the SEIU and its local unions have tried to disrupt
businesses and local governments in the following manner:
<UL>
<LI>To protest cuts in Washington's budget, Justice for Janitors
(a campaign arm of the SEIU) blocked three main highways during
morning rush hour, delaying commuters for two hours.  Other cities
have also experienced this traffic tactic.
<LI>A Detroit SEIU Local protested the popular North American
International Auto Show because it &quot;portrays life in Detroit
as better than it actually is.&quot;
<LI>Noted real estate developers in major cities, including Atlanta
and Washington, have been targeted by the SEIU's Justice for Janitors
because their agenda demands they pay more of their &quot;fair
share&quot; of taxes.
</UL>

<P>
Sweeney has promised to use the &quot;corporate campaign&quot;
with greater frequency to get concessions at the collective bargaining
table that ordinarily would not be forthcoming without outside
pressure.
<P>
The strategies used by unions in corporate campaigns include targeting
a business with intense media pressure --- both earned media and
paid advertising; thwarting critical business plans by organizing
coalitions around their defeat; filing frivolous charges against
a business with government agencies (local, state and federal);
and helping to pass stock-holder resolutions that promote union
crusades.
<P>
The AFL-CIO and Sweeney can also count on the support of the Clinton
Administration and U.S. Labor Secretary Robert Reich to aid the
AFL-CIO's resuscitation and agenda.
<P>
Clearly, President Clinton must rebuild bridges with labor and
will show a marked interest in its agenda during the upcoming
election year.  Sweeney has promised to punish all elected officials
-- including Democrats -- who do not support labor's objectives.
<P>
Whether Sweeney will succeed in his new role is questionable at
best.  His grand promises to win labor back the political clout
it once had, while simultaneously adding 250,00 workers to its
membership rolls, appear to be a tough road indeed.
<P>
More importantly:  How much is Sweeney willing to alienate labor
from the general public through the use of militant tactics to
achieve short-term objectives?  Not all of labor's rank and file
agree with Sweeney's tactics.
<P>
As former AFL-CIO president Donahue stated in his keynote address
at the convention where he lost the election:  &quot;We must worry
less about building bridges to the rest of society.  We must enlist
the support of the public, not inconvenience as many as possible.&quot;
<P>
The acceleration of unions' decline could indeed quicken under
the AFL-CIO leadership of Sweeney if he chooses the opposite course.

<title>Kerrigan: Superfund Program Needs Its Own Cleanup -- SBSC</title>
</HEAD>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">

<i>November 1995</i>
<hr>
<h2>Superfund Program Needs Its Own Cleanup</h2>
by Karen Kerrigan
<P>
</center>
<hr><P>
 
With broad-based regulatory relief probably on
hold for this year, members of Congress are selecting the most
egregious agencies and programs to reform.
<P>
Superfund  --  a super wast according to its critics  --  is one
such program that has been particularly troublesome to small businesses.
<P>
In its 15-year history, and despite tens of billions of dollars
of both private and public expenditures, only a fraction of the
waste sites targeted by the Environmental Protection Agency under
Superfund have actually been cleaned up.
<P>
The federal government has spent $10 billion on Superfund and
forced private parties to kick in another $80 billion.  According
to a 1994 report in BusinessWeek, only 49 out of 1270 waste sites
&quot;have been completely cleaned up.&quot;
<P>
In theory, the Superfund can be used to clean up a site on the
EPA's National Priority List.  The EPA then tracks down &quot;potentially
responsible parties&quot; and assigns responsibility for waste
site cleanups.
<P>
Often, though, the EPA forces parties to undertake the cleanup
from the start.  Noncompliance without &quot;sufficient cause&quot;
results in a fine of at least $25,000 per day.
<P>
Who are these responsible parties?  Superfund extends the liability
for cleanup to practically any entity that may have a disposed
of waste in the specified EPA site.
<P>
They include large and medium-sized companies.  But they also
include dry cleaners, automobile dealers, butcher shops, pizza
parlors and more.  Nonprofit groups and public entities have also
been caught in the Superfund web -- hospitals, schools and local
governments have been casts as polluters.
<P>
Here are a couple examples of small businesses put under the gun
by the EPA's Superfund program:
<P>
&#183; Formal Ware Rental Services of Tulsa, Okla., was notified
by the EPA that it would be held responsible for the cleanup of
a local Superfund site because it paid someone $14 in 1972 to
haul trash to the site.
<P>
&#183; Bob Novak, owner of the Jolly Butcher Shop, had to fork
over $11,000 originally destined for store improvements, because
the glue from cardboard boxes that he shipped to Ludlow Sanitary
Landfill in New York was deemed hazardous.
<P>
The current liability scheme remains the root of the problem,
according to critics who want to overhaul Superfund.  In determining
liability, the EPA uses illogical criteria.
<P>
Superfund, for example, allows for strict liability that holds
parties accountable regardless of intent or negligence.  The liability
is also retroactive, meaning actions taken before the law was
enacted still apply.  Even if firms were in full compliance of
the law prior to 1980, Superfund still exposes them to liability.
<P>
Joint and several liability also applies under Superfund.  Therefore,
the EPA can require that one business pay for the entire cleanup,
without regard to the degree of its own contribution to the waste
site and without total consideration tot the total number of contributors.
<P>
No concept of fair share exists under Superfund.  A business targeted
 by the EPA for cleanup naturally files lawsuits against other
businesses connected to the waste site.  All parties then tend
to turn to their insurance companies for reimbursement.
<P>
In addition, the type of waste disposed of by a firm is not factored
into the liability scheme.  A firm depositing fairly innocuous
materials may still be held liable.
<P>
Lawyers benefit handsomely from the Superfund quagmire.  It's
claimed that as much as one-third of Superfund money pays for
legal fees alone.  
<P>
Several congressional committees, including the House Small Business
Committee, are starting their hearings on Superfund reform.
<P>
The &quot;Superfund Liability Equity and Acceleration Act,&quot;
which repeals the law's retroactive liability provisions and replaces
the joint and several liability standard, was recently introduced.
 Parties will be held liable for the amount they contributed and
no more.
<P>
Small businesses and taxpayers may begin to rest easier at night
knowing that the weekly task of putting out the garbage may be
less of a liability with forthcoming congressional action.  Perhaps
the environment will actually get cleaned up as well.

<title>Kerrigan:  Capital Gains Tax Cut Needs Inflation Hedge -- SBSC</title>
</HEAD>

<i>October 1995</i>
<hr>
<h2> Capital Gains Tax Cut Needs Inflation Hedge</h2>
by Karen Kerrigan
<P>
</center>
<hr><P>
A cut in the capital gains tax is almost assured
this year.  Both the House and Senate are committed to the reduction,
and despite President Clinton's &quot;tax cuts for the rich&quot;
rhetoric, even he has hinted at supporting a capital gains tax
cut.  The House has passed legislation reducing the capital gains
tax from its current top level of 28 percent to 19.8 percent and
indexing the rate for inflation.  The measure calls for prospective
indexing (calculated from Jan. 1, 1995) on assets held for at
least three years.
<P>
It's expected that the Senate will pass a similar bill calling
for a 50 percent exclusion on capital gains income.  However,
it's unknown whether the Senate's version will allow taxpayers
to index for inflation.
<P>
According to investment experts and economists who favor cutting
(and eliminating) capital gains taxes, a huge expanse exists between
non-indexed and indexed capital gains tax rates.
<P>
Inflations can be a tax in itself by eroding purchasing power,
savings and investments.  The current nominal capital gains tax
rate is 28 percent.  However, when inflation is factored into
the capital gains equation, the real capital gains tax rate rises
substantially.
<P>
For example, on an investment with a one-year return of 10 percent,
assuming a 3 percent inflation rate, the non-indexed 28 percent
capital gains tax rate jumps to an inflation-adjusted rate of
40 percent.
<P>
Even with the proposed non-indexed rate of 19.8 percent, the real
rate on such an investment leaps to 28.3 percent.  And if inflation
reaches 5 percent, the rate doubles from 19.8 percent to 39.6
percent.
<P>
&quot;Lower rates of return and/or higher rates of inflation will
translate into even higher real capital gains tax rates,&quot;
says Ray Keating, chief economist of the Small Business Survival
Foundation.  &quot;These real capital gains tax rates act as severe
disincentives to investment and entrepreneurship,&quot; Keating
adds.
<P>
Without indexation, the government ends up taxing illusory profits.
 In fact, some individuals can wind up paying taxes on real capital
losses.  That is, after factoring for inflation, a nominal profit
on a transaction can turn out to be a real loss, yet the investor
still pays taxes on the nominal gain.
<P>
An investor's willingness to invest is substantially hindered
by taxing capital gains.  According to Keating and other economists,
indexation would eliminate inflation as a factor in capital gains
determination  --  equalizing stated and real capital gains tax
rate.
<P>
The lower real rate would reduce uncertainty and generate investment,
economic growth and job creation.
<P>
If non-indexation is so unfair, they why isn't its passage guaranteed
as part of a capital gains tax reduction?  The apparent roadblocks
are money and complexity.
<P>
Although history has shown that reducing capital gains tax rates
actually yields higher revenue for the U.S. Treasury, budget leaders
in the Senate are advocating an agenda of &quot;revenue neutrality&quot;
 -- meaning that for every dollar of tax cuts, a dollar of spending
cuts must be enacted in order to balance the budget by 2002.
<P>
Accordingly, indexing capital gains tax rates for inflation will
cost the government more money, meaning political leaders will
have to cut spending more deeply.
<P>
Opponents also claim that indexing is too complicated for taxpayers
to figure out.  In reality, indexation would require merely one
additional step of multiplication for taxpayers.
<P>
&quot;If taxpayers in Great Britain and Australia can deal with
indexing, I'm sure U.S. taxpayers can as well,&quot; responds
Keating.  Keating adds that if the complexity of indexation is
so troubling to our elected officials, then the most simple reform
is still available -- elimination of the capital gains tax.
<P>
Since late last year, investors have been counting on the capital
gains tax proposal offered by the House.  According to investment
experts, the failure to deliver on the tax cut would be a blow
to capital markets.
<P>
Keating points out that start-up and high-growth companies would
particularly be hurt, noting that the potential returns on high-risk
investments would be lower --- therefore, so would equity prices.
 Trillions of dollars of locked-up capital would not be available
for investment opportunities.
<P>
Venture capital, whether raised from one's family and friends
or from professional investors, remains a critical source of funding
for entrepreneurial  enterprises.
<P>
More often than not, small-business funding comes from someone
the entrepreneur knows.
<P>
Although lowering capital gains tax rates provides an additional
incentive to investors in prospective high-risk ventures, inflation
still remains a silent force working against an entrepreneurial
boom.
<P>
With a new majority in Congress advocating &quot;tax fairness,&quot;
indexing capital gains for inflation is not only fair, but good
for economic growth as well.
<P><P>

<title>SBB:  Spectrum Auctions Could Help Lower Deficit</title>

<h2>Spectrum Auctions Could Help Lower Deficit</h2>
                                                     </center>
<hr>

October 1995 --  The communications revolution has played a pivotal role in how America does business and impacts the personal lives of most Americans.  As Congress looks for ways to reduce the federal deficit, a debate has surfaced over the use of our nation's airwaves -- otherwise known as the "spectrum." 
<P>
Only twenty years ago, the average person could probably only identify a few uses of the spectrum -- namely broadcast television and  radio.  With technological advancements, though, have come more uses of the spectrum.  For example satellite TV, wireless computer networks and cellular phones all utilize the nation's airwaves.  And, the technological boom has caused the spectrum to jump in value.
<P>
Recognizing a handsome revenue source for the federal government, Congress in 1993 mandated that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) auction all licenses for new spectrum uses.   Recent auctions for the Personal Communications Services spectrum have raised more than $8 billion.  And, as budgetary pressures continue to bear down on the 104th Congress, spectrum auctions are being closely examined because of their revenue potential.
<P>
House and Senate Commerce Committees in the 104th Congress have been charged with raising $14 billion to help balance the budget by 2002.  Over the past several weeks, congressional hearings have revealed several areas that can be targeted to meet these tight revenue requirements.
<P>
A controversial but lucrative target for auctions are the airwaves now set-a-side for television broadcasters to develop high-definition television (HDTV).  In 1991, the FCC allocated six megahertz of extra spectrum for the broadcasters to make the transition to HDTV.  
<P>
After the switch, the broadcasters would then hand back their current channel, now used for analog TV transmission.  	But technology and the market outsmarted bureaucrats in Washington.  With technological gains, broadcasters can now provide digital (but not high definition) television utilizing a fraction of the airwaves.  In other words, rather than providing just one channel of HDTV, the broadcasters have the capability for multiple channels of digital television, while leaving space for other lucrative services.      
    
<P>
While the broadcasters still maintain that they will continue to develop HDTV with the allocated airwaves, they have also asked for "spectrum flexibility."
<P>
The flexibility will allow them to use the extra airwaves for any number of telecommunications services:  Six new channels of television, or 72 compact-disc quality radio signals, or cellular phone services, or interactive data services, or they can mix and match.
<P>
This proposal, however, does not sit well with telecommunication companies that have been required to purchase airwaves through auctions.  They view spectrum flexibility for broadcasters as a special government giveaway.
<P>
In a recent letter to Congress, the president of Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association (CTIA), Thomas A. Wheeler, expressed "shock and dismay as the broadcasters seek to ram through the Congress a special deal" that allows them to obtain new spectrum for free, while the wireless industry has had to pay $8 billion.
<P>
Like the broadcasters, members of CTIA did receive their initial spectrum allocation for free, but all subsequent wireless telecommunications spectrum has been acquired through auctions.    The broadcasters claim that they have been singled out, and the government has plenty of warehoused spectrum that should be auctioned off first before the broadcasting industry is disrupted.
<P>
The broadcasters also weigh in with their public-service responsibilities as an argument to exempt them from auctions.  And, they claim financial hardship in competing with other telecommunication industry players.
<P>
"If the spectrum earmarked for the transition to digital is auctioned, it will destroy the ability of local television stations to stay in business as the communications market moves to digital technology," Robert Wright, CEO of NBC, told the Senate Commerce Committee.     
<P>
Faye Anderson, Executive Director of the Council of 100, a national network of African-American Republicans, questions the broadcasters' claim of financial hardship, and the assertion that the government is sitting on a valuable reserve of spectrum.
<P>
Anderson points to the multi-billion dollar deals involving Disney's purchase of ABC/Cap Cities, and Westinghouse's bid for CBS to counter the argument that the broadcasters will not be able to compete in spectrum auctions because of a lack of capital.
<P>
Just how much money can be raised from the sale of the HDTV airwaves?    According to John Reidy, a managing director at the brokerage firm Smith Barney, Inc., who testified before the Senate Commerce Committee, $30 billion could go to the U.S. Treasury from the auctions.  Other experts say $30 billion is conservative.
<P>
With other important matters budgetary matters before Congress (such Medicare and welfare reform), industry observers and advocacy organizations are carefully following the spectrum issue as a barometer for "true change" in the Congress.

<title>SBB: Maximum Opposition to Minimum Wage Increase </title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><center><h2> Maximum Opposition to Minimum Wage Increase </h2>                                                     </center><hr>



September 1995 - Almost three years ago, then presidential candidate Bill Clinton stated that increasing the minimum wage is "the wrong way to raise the incomes of low-wage earners."  The wrong way back then, but the right way now as increasing the minimum wage is viewed as a politically popular strategy to reconnect with the Democrat's traditional base of working class Americans.
<P>
While most economists agree that minimum wage increases do more economic harm than good (both for workers and the economy), President Clinton has proposed a 21 percent increase from $4.25 to $5.15 an hour.
<P>
Democratic party leaders in the Congress are also working feverishly to include a minimum wage hike into welfare reform proposals, presumably to be acted upon this fall.
<P>
Studies conducted over the past 25 years have consistently concluded that with each 10 percent increase in the minimum wage, a corresponding 1 percent to 2 percent decline in entry-level employment results.  The General Accounting Office, the Brookings Institution, the Employment Policies Institute Foundation, the Congressional Budget Office and various Presidential Commission's have all reached this universal conclusion.
<P>
Even the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC), the "New Democrat" organization once led by the President, declared that "the minimum wage can be allowed to fade into history."
    <P>
As minimum wage hike proponents pose the issue as improving the living wage of lower-income workers, most businesses and their workers view minimum wage jobs as entry-level positions -- by which the majority of workers gain skills to move onto higher-paying work.
<P>
An independent study in 1992 demonstrated that within a 12 month period, 63 percent of American workers at the minimum wage earned higher wages.   Not surprisingly, about half of minimum wage employees were either young adults under the age of 21, or teenagers.
<P>
According to a study by The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think-tank in Washington, D.C., raising the minimum wage emotionally appeals to most Americans, but doing it would be a mistake.
<P>
According to the foundation study:
<P><ul>
<li>Raising the minimum wage will harm the nonworking poor by raising prices and destroying entry-level job opportunities.
<li>Raising the minimum wage does not generally help low-income households -- the increased income from minimum wage jobs would mostly go to families far above the poverty level, not to poor minimum wage workers.
<li>Employers will respond to a minimum wage increase by cutbacks in hiring, reducing workers' hours, or lowering pay and benefits and skipping pay raises -- responses that hurt, not help, workers.
<li>A $5.15 increase in the minimum wage will result in approximately 400,000 lost entry-level jobs.  A wage increase may result in more skilled workers being enticed into the job market, but fewer unskilled job opportunities (entry-level jobs) would be available.</ul>         
<P>
Grant Maloy, a small business operator from Orlando, Fl., testified earlier in the year before the Joint Economic Committee on the President's proposal to raise the minimum wage.  As the owner of a wholesale foliage nursery, Maloy stated that his industry pays $5.24 for entry-level work, well above the minimum wage.
<P>
"Wages have increased because of pressure both within the industry and from other industries, as well as the need to keep quality employees.  How is it possible that one central government can know what millions of businesses can afford to pay?  The answer is they can't," says Maloy.
<P>
According to Maloy, minimum wage policy is insincere.  While the government expects a business owner to pay a minimum wage, the owner himself may be making much less.  Maloy estimated that he was making about $2.00 an hour when he started his business.
<P>
Surveys of the American public continue to show widespread support for increasing the minimum wage, and in 1989 Congress overwhelmingly backed the last minimum wage increase -- more than 90 percent voted in favor of the hike.
<P>
Political experts agree that if a proposal to increase the minimum wage makes its way to the House or Senate floor for a vote, it may pass.  No member in Congress wants to be labeled as "anti-worker" despite the widespread research showing the negative effects of increasing the minimum wage on those it purportedly is supposed to help.
<P>
On the other hand, the public's dissatisfaction with Washington and misguided government attempts to solve every problem may indeed resonate with the minimum wage issue as well.
<P>
More importantly however, is how the public will view the President's proposal.  Is the President proposing to raise the minimum wage to truly help the working poor?  Or will the public perceive his proposal as a political ploy to gain votes in 1996.
<P>
What remains certain though, is the growing universal belief that the minimum wage does little for increasing job opportunities for those who need it most.

<title>SBB:  FDA's Stubborn Inefficiency is Killing Business and Jobs                                                                                                </title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><center>
<h2>FDA's Stubborn Inefficiency is Killing Business and Jobs</h2>                                                 </center>
<HR>
September 1995 -- The 104th Congress is leaving no stone unturned in terms of its examination of federal government agencies.  OSHA, EPA, IRS, FBI, ATF, EEOC, and other agencies are being probed for inefficiency and counterproductive impact on American business.
<P>
Included in this review is the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -- long held in high regard by the American public.
<P>
The FDA has squandered its goodwill with the industries it regulates, as well as with patient groups and politicians from Democratic and Republican camps for its growing inefficiency and unaccountability.  One major criticism, concerns FDA's severe shortcomings in approving new drugs and medical devices.
<P>
Breakthrough medical devices, for example, face lengthy approval times.  Although FDA guidelines maintain that the approval process is supposed to be completed within 180 days, independent studies have revealed that actual approval periods take anywhere from 437 to 840 days.
<P>
In testimony before the House Joint Economic Committee in 1994, Robert DeHaven of the American Electronics Association (AEA) testified that the FDA's "inordinately slow" regulatory process was threatening "the global competitiveness" of the medical device industry -- a $70 billion industry with more than 11,000 companies.
<P>
A recent survey conducted by the AEA found that 40 percent of medical device firms reduced their number of U.S. employees because of FDA delays, 29 percent boosted investment in foreign operations, and 22 percent moved U.S. jobs out of the country.
<P>
Robert Higgs, in a report for the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI), notes that medical technology firms invested about $321-$333 million abroad annually from 1989 to 1991.  In 1992, though, "when the FDA abruptly made its enforcement and approval policies more onerous, capital outflow jumped more than 200 percent to $993 million."  
<P>
Along with the export of capital to international shores goes American innovation, entrepreneurship, high-paying jobs and our best growth industries say critics.
<P>
"The FDA seems more intent on exporting American ingenuity and entrepreneurship, rather than encouraging the production of U.S.-made drugs and medical devices," says Raymond Keating, chief economist with the Small Business Survival Committee.
<P>
U.S. pharmaceutical companies also face the same regulatory maze and bureaucratic gridlock as medical device companies.  Although established drug companies have learned how to deal with the FDA's red tape, longer approval periods mean higher development costs, which translate into higher drug prices for consumers.
<P>
Between 1986 and 1993, the median approval time for generic drug applications increased from 12 months to 38 months.  These time periods exclude FDA requirements placed on firms that extend development time.
<P>
In a study conducted by researchers at Tufts University for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America,  drugs originating here often are available in foreign markets many years before becoming availability in the U.S.  For example, of all drugs approved in the U.S., 12 percent had been available in foreign markets for six to 10 years, and another 9 percent for more than a decade.
<P>
Despite the drug approval lag, safety does not appear to be enhanced in the U.S.  According to the Tufts study, although Great Britain gets drugs to market quicker that the U.S., safety discontinuations as a percentage of total new drug introductions are similar in each country -- 4 percent in Great Britain and 3 percent in the U.S.
<P>
As reports and criticism mount against the FDA, its staff and defenders contend that the agency is in dire need of more funds to keep up with its workload.  A look at the FDA's budget growth over the years shows that from 1989 to 1994, real FDA budget authority increased by 52.6 percent -- or by an average annual real rate of more than 10.5 percent.  FDA's 1994 budget was just more than $900 million.
<P>
During those same years, the number  of employees grew by a substantial 25.3 percent, totaling more than 9,000.   Critics claim American taxpayers are paying more to get less.
<P>
Of course, a multitude of other industries are impacted by FDA regulation:  food, cosmetic, restaurant, retail druggist, manufacturers of medical devices and now the tobacco  industry has its own gripes about the FDA's heavy-handedness.
<P>
The key for Congress is balancing the concerns of the American public that the FDA preserve and protect the public health, with the concerns of business that the FDA's inefficiency has gone to far -- costing Americans jobs, as well as access to breakthrough drugs and medical devices.
<P>
Critics claim that FDA Commissioner Dr. David Kessler has spent too much time on aggressive enforcement and investigation of businesses rather than cooperating with the industries he regulates to move the approval process along in a timely manner.
<P>
Former FDA officials also cite Commissioner Kessler's obsession with regulating tobacco at the expense of other agency responsibilities.   A former chief FDA investigator sent a letter to the U.S. House Commerce Committee stating that, for example, the FDA's foreign inspection program was a "disaster waiting to happen."
<P>
According to a Washington, D.C. newspaper, the same official said that he attempted to meet with and contact Kessler several times on important matters " and was told by his secretary that if my topic was anything other than cigarettes, the commissioner would have no time for me."        
<P>
    With the FDA under attack from industry, Congress and patients groups who want faster approval times for life-saving drugs and medical devices, the agency may begin to change course and reinvent itself.   However, under mounting criticism from these constituencies, Congress itself may devise an FDA reform bill that forces  Kessler and his staff to put their time and resources into more productive efforts that save lives, American jobs and entire industries.

<title>Time to cut the fat out of Davis-Bacon Act</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">

<h2>Time to cut the fat out of Davis-Bacon Act</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
August 1995 - Early this summer, the National Policy Forum, a Washington-based
Republican think tank, released its Agenda for Small Business  --- a seven-point plan to ensurethe vitality and prosperity of the small-business, entrepreneurial sector.  The plan includes tax and regulatory relief, capital access measures, tort reform and several other proposals near and dear to small business.<p>
Item No. 7 on NPF's agenda is a very specific reform aimed at helping small businesses compete for federally funded construction projects.  It calls for the elimination of the Davis-Bacon Act.<p>
The Davis-Bacon Act mandates that a "prevailing wage" be paid to all workers on
federally funded construction projects in excess of $2,000.  The U.S. Department of Labor sets these wage rates for thousands of job classifications in scores of regions across the country.<p>
The Coalition to Repeal Davis-Bacon, a coalition of nearly 70 organizations ranging from the National School Boards Association to Citizens Against Government Waste, claims that prevailing wage rates are vastly inflated and generally reflect union rates.<p>
And the Congressional Budget Office estimated in 1995 that the Davis-Bacon act raises construction costs by at least $2.7 billion over five years.<p>
What's more, according to David Thompson, a Washington attorney specializing in labor law, Davis-Bacon creates an artificial market in which only large companies can compete.<p>
"Excessive paperwork requirements, arbitrary work rules and classifications and bloatedpay scales block access for small companies.  The law creates an unrealistic environment in which small local companies cannot afford to participate," says Thompson.<p>
Union leaders say wage rates set by the Labor Department do reflect market wage rates.  However, an investigative report done by the state of Oklahoma suggests that the wage surveying process itself may be corrupt.<p>
The report concludes that fraudulent wage data was submitted to the U.S. Department of Labor to "influence the outcome of U.S. Department of Labor wage surveys and, consequently, to take advantage of the taxpayers."<p>
In the voluntary wage-surveying process, any group or individual can submit completed
projects to help the Labor Department make its wage decisions.  In one example of fraud, asurvey claimed that 20 employees, compensated at $21.05 per hour, worked on a $2 million underground storage tank.  The investigation found that tank was never built.<p>
According to Oklahoma officials, if this type of fraudulent practice is occurring in one
place, it's probably occurring in others.<p>
"The prevailing wage law is premised on the false assumption that the government can
accurately determine what wage is prevailing.  There's no reasonable way to obtain true
prevailing wage information and therefore the entire system must be scrapped," says Ike Casey, executive vice president of Independent Electrical Contractors Inc.<p>
Members of Congress who support repealing Davis-Bacon contend that the market is the best determinant of wage rates.  That's why efforts for repeal are quickly moving through the House and Senate.  Senator Nancy Kassebaum (R-Kan.) has pushed a repeal bill through the Labor and Human Resources Committee, while legislation moving through the House is on an identical track.<p>
Repealing the Davis-Bacon will not be easy.  Labor unions and other beneficiaries of
Davis-Bacon will aggressively lobby Congress with a very effective argument  --- a vote to repeal Davis-Bacon is a vote to "cut our wages."<p>
Labor unions believe keeping Davis-Bacon is in all workers' interest, while supporters of
repeal feel it protects a privileged few at the expense of taxpayers.<p>

<title>A New Test For Independent Contractors</title>

<h2>A New Test For Independent Contractors</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
August 1995 - There is plenty about the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that raises the ire of small business owners and entrepreneurs.  The 20-factor test utilized by the IRS to delineate between independent contractors and employees is one such issue causing both confusion and agitation.<p>
Clarifying the status of independent contractors has long been a concern for small
businesses and the self-employed.  The need for the IRS to provide a more concise, objective standard for independent contractors was the priority issue voted on by thousands of delegates at The White House Conference on Small Business earlier this summer.<p>
Rep. Linda Smith (R-Wash.), chairman of the Subcommittee on Taxation and Finance of the Small Business Committee, recently held hearings on the complexity of the issue as well as proposed legislation to amend the criteria used by the IRS.<p>
"For too long, the IRS has been retarding job growth and business expansion because of fear it will re-classify independent contractors as employees," said Smith in announcing her hearings.<p>
Rep. Jon Christensen (R-Neb.) agrees with Rep. Smith, and testified on legislation he
sponsored, the Independent Contractor Tax Simplification Act -- a bill to modify and simplify the 20-factor test.<p>
"Almost everyone will agree that the 20-factor test is unclear and far too subjective.  It is quite possible to take two seemingly identical situations and find employee status in one, and independent contractor in another.  Nevertheless, in recent years the IRS has bludgeoned small businesses over the head with the 20-factor test," said Christensen.<p>

     Indeed many individuals who prefer to work as independent contractors have had their status challenged by the IRS.  Even though it may be an individual's choice to work autonomously, the test used by the IRS may re-classify them as an employee, causing back-taxes and penalties for the business contracting with the individual.<p> 
According to one recent study, the IRS has reclassified 439,000 independent workers
since the mid-1980s, resulting in the collection of $678 million in taxes and fines.  The IRS simply states that it is only doing a very tough job -- it attributes about $2 billion in lost revenues to employers who wrongly misclassify workers.<p>
Christensen's bill would not eliminate the 20-factor test, but simply provides an
alternative for those who comply with all income reporting requirements.  Rather than attempting to determine who is an employee, Christensen's legislation defines who is not an employee.<p>
"It establishes distinct, clear and objective criteria for those seeking to perform services as an independent contractor," says Christensen.<p>
The three-part test established by Christensen requires that an independent contractor
demonstrate independence, investment in his or her business, and a written agreement between the parties.<p>
While Part Three of the test, Contract, is easy to establish, demonstrating independence and investment each have several sub-tests.  The independent contractor is required to meet only one criterion of the sub-tests to satisfy that portion of the test. <p>  
For example, Part One of the three-part test is Investment.  The individual would have to satisfy one of the following sub-tests to satisfy Part One.  Does the individual:<p>
(1)  have a significant investment in training or assets; or<br>
(2)  incur significant unreimbursed expenses; or<br>
(3)  agree to work for a specific time or complete a specific result, and is liable for<br>
damages for failure to perform; or<br>
(4)  receive compensation primarily on a commission basis; or<br>
(5)  purchase a product for resale?<p>     
Under Part Two of the test, the independent contractor would also be required to meet 
one of several subtests to satisfy his or her independence.  <p>
If, however, the independent contractor and the business for whom services are being
provided do not comply with income reporting rules, the 20-factor test would apply to their business relationship.<p>
Acknowledging problems with worker classification, the IRS has developed reforms of
its own to deal with the controversial issue.  On August 2, it released a set of initiatives.<p>
"I've spent a lot of time talking with small businesses who believe this is a big
problem...We can do better, and will do better in handling worker classification issues," said IRS Commissioner Margaret Richardson in a statement.<p>
In order to improve the administration of worker classification, the IRS would provide
greater training for their auditors, consolidate the review process when employers challenge the status of worker determinations, and better coordinate national enforcement to ensure consistency of worker classification by industry and region.  Anything else, says the IRS, can only be implemented through legislation.<p>
Critics contend the IRS initiatives are weak and meaningless.<p>
"I'm very concerned that the administrative programs the IRS may wish to strengthen, are actually part of the problem because there are still no clear rules for implementing them," said Chairman Smith.<p>
As technology and corporate downsizing continue to shape the independent workforce, the IRS will eventually be forced to simplify and clarify the status of independent contractors.  If the IRS doesn't, it will literally take an act of Congress to change the bias against independent contractors.  That change, is well under way.<p>

<title>OSHA Has Forgotten its Original Purpose</title>

<h2>OSHA Has Forgotten its Original Purpose</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
July 1995 - Business owners who've experienced an OSHA inspection get very emotional when talking about the government agency whose job it is to ensure that America's workplaces are safe and hazard-free.  According to many of these businesses, inspectors create a no-win situation by playing a "gothcha-game," with OSHA finding fault no matter how safe the work environment.<p>
Critics of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) claim that the agency has
completely turned away from advising on, and promoting workplace safety and health.  OSHA, claims business, is a complete adversary of business.<p>
According to Rep. Cass Ballenger (R-NC), Chairman of the Workforce Protections
Committee of the U.S. House Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities, OSHA's mission is enforcement driven -- find violations and issue penalties.<p>  
"In my view, nothing illustrates how OSHA has gone off the track more clearly than the
fact that today few, if any, employers would ever call OSHA and ask for assistance or advice on workplace safety or health," said Ballenger when introducing H.R. 1834, an OSHA reform bill. <p>
Called the "Safety and Health Improvement and Regulatory Act of 1995," Ballenger
thoroughly aims to change the way OSHA operates.<p>
A key reform of H.R. 1834 allows businesses to correct violations found by OSHA,
without paying a penalty when the citation is issued.  If a business fails to take corrective action, only then will a fine result -- not the situation today.<p>   
"It does not matter whether the violation is not threatening to any employees.  Nor does it matter whether the employer knew of the regulation -- he or she is presumed to know all of what is printed in the Federal Register, and the unending "compliance directives" from Washington," said Ballenger.<p>
Many businesses hire OSHA consultants in preparation for an inspection.  Even so,
inspectors generally find something wrong and a monetary fine is usually issued.  This is unfair according to Ballenger, and under his plan OSHA will work with employers to identify and correct hazards.<p>
Ballenger's subcommittee recently began holding hearings on OSHA reform, and heard from both supporters and detractors of  H.R. 1834.  Business organizations were extremely supportive of the measure, while representatives from organized labor were not pleased.<p>
Thomas Donahue, Secretary-Treasurer of the AFL-CIO ripped apart the measure by
calling it a "cruel and regressive measure that puts workers' lives in danger."<p>
"It [H.R. 1834] presumes that employers will act responsibly on their own, without
government oversight or intervention, in the best interest of workers, despite a long history demonstrating this not be the case for many employers," testified Donahue.<p>
Ballenger's bill does not remove enforcement, but shifts the balance 50-50 with non-enforcement efforts to be phased-in over three years.<p>
Expansion of non-enforcement programs in H.R. 1834 include:<p>
<ul>
<li>State consultation grant programs for on-site assistance to small businesses in high hazard industries.
<li>Increasing OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program (VPP)  -- which recognizes employers with exemplary safety programs and records, and grants exemptions from enforcement inspections.
<li>An emphasis on training and education to promote safe work practices for both
employers and employees.
<li>A new certification program to allow individuals to conduct workplace inspections.  A
business would not be inspected by OSHA as long as the business remained 
accident-free and had no employee complaints.<p></ul>
The Clinton Administration has also heard an earful from both employers and members
of Congress regarding OSHA's heavy hand.  In response to political pressure, and criticism from the business community, OSHA lowered financial penalty rates that were vastly increased by Labor Secretary Robert Reich.  OSHA assistant secretary Joseph Dear will not pursue controversial ergonomic rules which the agency has been preparing for years.<p>  
And, the Administration has put forward its own reform initiative that would "reinvent"
OSHA.  While recognizing the need for changes in OSHA, President Clinton believes
Republican plans go way beyond reform. <p>
"They're [Republicans] not trying to reform the system of worker protection as we are,
but instead to dismantle it," said Clinton.<p>
The Congress is scheduled to have more hearings on OSHA reform -- not soon enough for business groups who must deal with sometimes silly and outrageous regulations. <p>
The National Roofing Contractors Association (NRCA), for example, has its own top-ten list of "favorite" roofing regulations.  Eight out of ten are OSHA inflicted.  For example, OSHA's rules:<p>
<ul>
<li>Prohibits gum chewing while roofing. 
<li>Require the posting of signs saying respirators are required even when they are not. 
<li>Require employers to train employees on hazards of exposure to deadly materials like chalk, lumber and dishwashing detergent.
<li>Fines employer if a roofer smokes on the job. <p></ul>
...and the list continues.<p>
According to Washington business leaders, the time has come to reform OSHA.  Craig
Brightup, Vice President of Government Relations at NRCA, says changes are long overdue.<p>
"Over the past 20 years, the very foundation of OSHA has held business completely in
the pejorative. They believe business cannot be trusted to implement meaningful health and safety programs themselves, and this is simply not true," says Brightup.<p>   
According to Brightup, H.R. 1834 is designed to reward and support businesses who
make a good faith effort, which most employers do.
While everyone, except organized labor, believe OSHA must be reformed, the question
remains as to how far the President will go to make the agency less burdensome.  With the '96 election cycle moving quickly upon us, the Administration needs the support of labor at the ballot box making business groups wary of the President's intentions.<p>

<title>Is It Time to Eliminate the Commerce Department?</title>
</head>
<center>
<h2>Is it Time to Eliminate the Commerce Department?</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
July 1995 - Former Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher recently referred to his old Department as "nothing more than a hall closet where you throw in everything that you don't know what to do with."  Presumably, Washington budget-cutters agree and have decided that its time to clean out the Department of Commerce's closet. <p>
The U.S. House and Senate recently passed balance budget resolutions that would erase the deficit in seven years.   The budget-cutting ax has been broadly wielded, cutting and eliminating many government programs and agencies which have traditionally  benefitted American business.  The Department of Commerce is one such program targeted for elimination by both the House and Senate budget plans.<p>
The Commerce Department has long been a target of conservative budget cutters who see the department as wasteful, inefficient and duplicative of other programs.<p>
The government's own watchdog agency, the Government Accounting Office (GAO),
uncharitably describes Commerce as well.  GAO reports that the department "faces the most complex web of divided authorities" sharing its "mission with at least 71 federal department, agencies and offices."  More than 60 percent of its budget is allotted to programs entirely unrelated to its mission.<p>
Legislation proposed in the House and Senate would eliminate most  of Commerce, while transferring, consolidating and privatizing its useful functions.  Rep. Dick Chrysler (R-Mich.) recently introduced "The Department of Commerce Dismantling Act of 1995" in the House, while Sens. Spencer Abraham (R-Mich.) and Lauch Faircloth (R-NC) introduced a companion bill in the Senate.<p>
"This is not just a reckless effort to slash programs for the sake of cutting government," said Chrysler.  Chrysler chaired a three month effort in the House to study and examine the Commerce Department.<p>
"If we found that a program was duplicative, we consolidated it.  If a program was better performed by the private sector, we privatized it.  If it was beneficial, we streamlined it," added Chrysler.<p>
In addition, programs found wasteful were eliminated.  The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that both Senate and House Commerce Department elimination measures would save taxpayers more than $7.765 billion over five years.<p>
What parts of Commerce would be eliminated, while others salvaged under the
Department of Commerce Dismantling Act of 1995?  Highlights include:<p>
<ul>
<li>Administrative functions of Commerce and the Office of the Secretary, General Counsel and Inspector General -- eliminated.  <b>Estimated savings -- $250 million.</b>
<li>Minority Business Development Agency -- eliminated.  Found to be duplicative of the functions of the Small Business Administration and private sector.<b>  Estimated savings -- $1.139 billion.</b>
<li>United States Travel and Tourism Administration -- eliminated.  Promotional activities already considered performed by the private sector, states, localities and public sector organizations.<b>  Estimated savings -- $75 million.</b>
<li>Technology Administration.  Gone are programs that specifically fund applied research  programs, and invest taxpayer dollars in new technology promotion.  The National Technical Information Service is privatized while the weights and measure functions of the National Institutes for Standards and Technology is transferred to the National Science Foundation.<b> Estimated Savings -- $1.872 billion.</b>
<li>Patent and Trade Office.  Transferred to Justice Department and supported through fees.<b>Estimated Savings -- $375 million.</b>
<li>Economic and Statistics Administration.  Bureau of Census transferred to Justice.  Bureau of Economic Analysis transferred to the Federal Reserve System. <b> Estimated Savings: $827 million.</b>
<li>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which accounts for more than 40 percent of Commerce's budget, would have its various functions privatized and
transferred to more appropriate agencies. <b> Estimated savings:  $2.338 billion.</b>
<li>Export and Trade Administration functions would largely be transferred to the Office of Trade Representative while other miscellaneous duties eliminated.  <b>Estimated savings -- $385 million.</b></ul><p>                   
The threat of closing Commerce's door has not brought with it a firestorm of protest from the Washington business lobby.  While some business leaders see the elimination of Commerce as the price to pay for a more fiscally sound government, others have remained silent on the prospects of its closure. <p>
A recent private survey conducted by Business Week magazine, however, found that 69 percent of  business CEO's  it polled favored eliminating the department.<p>
Commerce Secretary Ronald Brown remains the biggest advocate of preserving the
department.  In his efforts to save Commerce, Brown contends that the department is crucial to business and U.S. competitiveness.  Brown also believes that eliminating Commerce would leave a void for business in the Administration.<p>
"These plans to cut Commerce would eliminate business' voice at the Cabinet table just when we have created the most successful public-private partnership relationship in history," remarked Brown.<p>
Critics of  the Clinton Administration do not view Brown's presence during Cabinet
meetings as having been beneficial for business.<p>
Richard Rahn, Chairman of the Business Leadership Council remarked that "It's a sad commentary on the Clinton Administration when only one cabinet member thinks he represents the interests of business.   Secretary Brown is a spokesman for only a fraction of the business community.  All Cabinet members should have a shared agenda of economic growth and job creation through policies that include lower taxes and reduced regulations, a real pro-business agenda -- an agenda we have not seen from Mr. Brown or the Clinton Administration." <p>
With hardly a whimper from the business community to keep the doors of Commerce open, elimination may happen.  But President Clinton and Secretary Brown have made several political friends through Commerce Department activities (such as private trade missions abroad) and may ask those who benefitted to turn up the heat on Congress to stop its door from shutting for good.<p>

<title>SBB:  Worker Database Could Cost Businesses Billions</title>
</head>

<h2>Worker Database Could Cost Businesses Billions</h2>
<p>
</center>

<hr>
<p>
<b>Washington, D.C.</b> -- Nearly 4 million illegal aliens are living permanently in the United States. In response to a growing problem, momentum is building in Congress to create a national worker database which would verify the employment eligibility of all U.S. citizens and eligible immigrants.<p>

	Critics of the proposed system have voiced concern that a worker registry would cost taxpayers billions while adding an expensive regulatory condition on U.S. businesses.<p>

	At a time when elected officials are aiming to lift regulatory burdens on U.S. business, the critics say a worker registry would create more paperwork, cause more delays interfere with hiring decisions and spawn legal concerns because of unchartered civil rights issues.<p>

	The national worker registry was recommended by the Commission on Immigration Reform -- more widely known as the Jordan Commission -- chaired by former Rep. Barbara Jordan. The worker registry would be created by merging the databases of the Social Security Administration (SSA) and the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS).<p>

	Legislation proposed by Senator Alan Simpson (R-WY), Chairman of the Immigration Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee, would require employers to call the worker registry system to verify that an applicant is legally authorized to work.<p>

	A forthcoming proposal in the House by Lamar Smith (R-TX) is expected to call for the establishment of a national worker identity card. The ID system would consist of a single tamper-proof card modeled after the social security card.<p>

	The Clinton administration has favored such an approach, as well as the national computer registry. In his proposed 1996 budget, President Clinton included $28 million to start integrating various government databases so the work registry can be developed.<p>

	The administration has also been testing its own program, the Telephone Verification System (TVS). With this system, businesses would be required to purchase special equipment to comply with worker verification.<p>

	For two years, nine companies have participated in the TVS project. The companies call
the INS to verify that non-citizens who apply for work are eligible for employment. A review of this project found that the INS could not accurately rely on the computer information 28 percent of the time and had to perform a manual search of its records.<p>

	According to a special report by the Justice Department, which evaluated the TVS project, secondary verifications were very burdensome to employers. Businesses, which already complain about the burdensome nature of the current employee verification system (the I-9 form), would have more forms to complete as part of the hiring process with a national computer registry. Employers would have to maintain authorization receipts on each employee they check through the new system. Employees subject to secondary verification will require yet another form.<p>

	Of serious concern to business groups and those involved with civil liberty issues, is the federal government's ability to competently manage the immense database. Accuracy of data will be critical to making the registry work, and both the INS and SSA have been widely criticized for inaccuracy in record keeping.<p>

	In California, for example, the INS admitted it lost 60,000 green-card applicant files. And the INS has experienced error rates as high as 30 percent. SSA has estimated that cleaning up its database would initially cost $122 million, and each year thereafter $30 million to maintain.<p>

	According to a 1988 General Accounting Office report, of about 210 million Social Security numbers active "at least 75 percent issued without proof of the individual's identity or citizenship."<p>

	With 65 million Americans changing jobs or entering the job market each year, even a 1 percent failure rate could be problematic -- 650,000 workers could be affected by even minimal errors.<p>

	In addition, those concerned about privacy have speculated that a centralized system would spur the government to include more information about individuals.<p>

	A key feature of the proposed is a monitoring system that tracks which companies access the system. The government would then have the ability to track business's hiring practices, as well as the individual employment history of every American.<p>

	With other major issues before the Congress such as deficit reduction and tax cuts, the proposed national worker registry has received little attention from the news media or the Congressional leadership in either the House and Senate. However, as such legislation makes it way through committees in both chambers, more Members of Congress are beginning to pay attention to the ramifications of a centralized worker registry.<p>

	Will Congress enact a data system affecting 100 percent of the population to combat the problem of 1.5 percent who live in the United States illegally.<p>

	Given the momentum to limit the size and scope of the federal government, the worker registry will indeed be put through a rigorous examination process in Congress. As more business groups learn about the proposed system, the debate will become even more rigorous.<p>

	Karen Kerrigan is president of the Small Business Survival Foundation in Washington. Her column appears twice monthly.<p>

<title>SBB: The Consumers Added to the Equation of Health Care Reform </title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><center><h2> The Consumers Added to the Equation of Health Care Reform </h2>                                                     </center><hr>



 June 1995 - This time last year, small business organizations were fighting against President and Mrs. Clinton's plan to radically overhaul our nation's health care system. The employer mandate, the centerpiece of the failed proposal, did not sit well with small businesses.  The "crisis" rhetoric seems to have toned down, but high health care costs along with the inability of many businesses to provide health care for their employees still remains a priority issue for our  nation's smaller employers.
<P>
The magnitude of the problem was recently confirmed at the White House Conference on Small Business where nearly two thousands elected delegates from all corners of the country gathered in Washington from June 12-15 to develop a national small business agenda for the Clinton Administration and Congress.  The dominant health care issue was tax equity.  Small businesses and the self-employed only want what corporations already have -- the ability to deduct 100 percent of their health care insurance expenses.
<P>
Is health care reform dead under the leadership of the new Republican controlled Congress?  The answer is no.  But rather than big government schemes and mandates, health care proposals are emerging from the new Congress that are more market-based.  One idea, that has been tried and tested in the private sector is tax free Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs).  The concept has taken Capitol Hill by storm, and it seems that all serious proposals to reform our nation's health care cost problem include an MSA provision.

<P><b>Health Care's "Sick" Underlying Structure</b><P>
   The MSA, say its supporters, will re-establish the buyer-seller relationship between consumers and suppliers of health care services.  Under the predominant third-party system of payments, neither consumers nor providers have an incentive to be concerned about costs.  Therefore, costs naturally rise.
<P>
The two veins to the third party system, government involvement in the health care market (especially since the inception of Medicaid and Medicare) and an expanded definition of "insurance," have perverted health care costs while shielding the health care industry from real market forces that produce competition.   By definition, insurance is supposed to cover catastrophic and unforeseen events.  Today, health insurance plans cover small and predicable expenses.
<P>
Such an expansion of the definition of health insurance, says Small Business Survival Foundation Chief Economist Raymond Keating, "would be the equivalent of extending one's home-owners insurance to cover the costs of mowing the lawn, trimming bushes and painting the house."
<P>
Third-party payments have drastically increased over the past three decades.  In 1950, for example, government financed 25.3 percent of health care expenditures, private insurance 15.8 percent, and 58.9 percent was covered out of pocket.  According to the <i>Statistical Abstract of the United States</I>, by 1991, government financed expenditures equalled 43.9 percent, private insurance and other private sources 36.9 percent, and only 19.2 percent was out of pocket.  
The effect of the usurpation of the buyer-seller relationship has been steadily rising costs.  For example, per capita U.S. health care expenditure between 1965 and 1991 increased by 1,306 percent, versus a rise in the consumer index of 332 percent.

<P><b>Medical Savings Accounts</b><P>	The most common MSA scenario would shift standard health care plans to a split system of an MSA combined with a catastrophic plan.  A standard plan costing $5,000, for example, could be replaced with $3,000 going into an employee's MSA and $2,000 covering a catastrophic plan with a $3,000 deductible.
<P>
The employee withdraws funds from the MSA, penalty free, to pay out-of-pocket medical expenses.  Since the employee now has an established "budget" and is able to keep what he or she does not use by year-end, the employee has an incentive to comparison shop for health care purchases and needs.  As consumers become more concerned with costs, MSA supporters contend that health care providers are forced to be more cost sensitive in pricing health care services -- in other words real competition will be injected into the health care market.
<P>
According to Dan Perrin, Executive Director of the Business Coalition for Affordable Health Care, a 1.6 million member coalition of business organizations that support MSAs, lower income individuals would especially benefit from the reform.  "Under the current system, most people must shell out money until they reach their $500 deductible.  With an MSA, employees have immediate access to funds, easing financial concerns which makes them more happy," says Perrin.
<P>
The MSA account is also owned by the employee, and therefore portable.  Individuals can also build savings in their MSA accounts, which in turn helps offset health care costs in case the employee loses their job.

<P><b>MSA Legislation</b><P>
On June 13, Reps. Bill Archer (R-TX) and Andy Jacobs (D-IN) introduced the Family Medical Savings and Investment Act.  The centerpiece of the legislation includes the creation of MSAs.   At a time when the new Congress is working to be more budget conscious, detractors of MSAs contend that the bill will "cost" taxpayers too much.
<P>
However, Perrin claims that whatever the bill will cost (according to some Capitol Hill sources estimates have been placed at $1.18 billion over five years), it is as close to revenue neutral as you will get, but with dramatic results for our nation's health care system in terms of making health care more affordable for all Americans.  Businesses, too, will benefit from MSAs as administrative costs are reduced according to Perrin.  Forbes, Inc., using an MSA plan since 1991, has reduced its insurance premium costs by 27 percent.  
<P>
Perrin predicts that MSA legislation will be enacted by early fall.  According to other supporters, the current Republican leadership in Congress is anxious to address the health care reform issue, and believes that MSAs will empower individuals while providing incentives to save for expenses not covered in their health plans.  Businesses will be given an opportunity to participate or shift to a system that is more consumer-oriented and puts employees directly in control of their health care purchases.
<P>
The new Congress may not immediately give small businesses and the self-employed the equal tax treatment they are looking for, but perhaps they are giving Americans the opportunity to be consumers once again in the health care market.<P>

<title>Small Business and the Flat Tax</title>

<h2>Small Business and the Flat Tax</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
May 1995 - While a hot, mid-summer debate is expected between the U.S. House and
Senate regarding the size and scope of tax cuts (if any at all), both chambers are moving full speed ahead on hearings to study a complete overhaul of our nation's tax system. <p> 
Committees in the House and Senate have already held hearings on the "flat tax"  -- a
simplified postcard system popularized by Republican Majority Leader Dick Armey.  The House Ways and Means Committee will hold a three-day marathon session from June 6-8 on all leading alternative tax systems.   The main plans for replacing the current income tax system include a flat tax, a national sales tax, a consumed-income" tax, or a value-added tax (VAT).  <p>
Hearings on the flat tax and its impact on the small business and entrepreneurial sector were held by the Subcommittee on Taxation and Finance of the House Small Business Committee.  Chairman, Linda Smith (R-WA), a freshman who operated a tax consulting business, is particularly interested in determining the effects of the flat tax on small business.<p>  
"We are placing them [small businesses] at the forefront of the debate on revamping the federal tax system to ensure their voice is heard," said Smith.   <p>
The Subcommittee heard from a diverse group of economists and business organizations, as well as Majority Leader Dick Armey and Senator Arlen Specter (R-Penn) who testified on their respective flat tax proposals.  The Armey Flat Tax plan includes the following elements (after being fully phased in over a three year period):<p>
<ul>
<li>all wages, salaries, and pensions would be taxed at a flat 17 percent rate (begins at 19 percent);
<li>capital gains, earnings from savings, and dividends would not be subject to taxation.
<li>a personal exemption of $13,000 would be permitted for a single person, $17,200 for a single head of household, and $26,200 for a married couple filing jointly, and $5,300 for each dependent.  Exemptions would be indexed for inflation.
<li>business owners would pay a 17 percent rate on the difference between revenues and  expenses, assuming of course that revenues exceed expenses.  The tax would be levied on gross revenue minus purchases of goods and services, capital equipment, structures, land and wages paid to employees.  Deductions would not be allowed for fringe benefits, interest, or payments to owners.<p></ul>
Concerns of members of the subcommittee ranged from transitional issues -- eg: how will small businesses be impacted as the federal government moves from the current tax system to the flat tax? -- to questions about what deductions small businesses may lose under the flat tax scenario.  Economists as well as business leaders agreed that transitional issues are important because business owners have made long-term business decisions based on the current U.S. tax code.<p>
In terms of the impact on business deductions, economist Alvin Rabushka (author of the notable book The Flat Tax) stated that all costs associated with operating a business are fully deductible as business expenses.  According to Rabushka, home offices, advertising costs, and business meals, for example, are qualified business expenses.<p>    
Raymond Keating, chief economist of the Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC)
outlined his criteria for members of Congress to consider upon designing a tax system:<p>
<ul>
<li>Low Flat Tax Rate to Promote Economic Growth
<li>No Taxation of Capital
<li>The Inflation Factor (its effects should be factored into a system's design)
<li>Clarity
<li>Simplicity
<li>Limited Bureaucracy and Intrusiveness
<li>Minimum Incentives For Tax Avoidance
<li>No Additional Boost to Government Spending<p>
</ul>
In his overall assessment of the flat tax before the subcommittee, Keating stated that the flat tax scores high as measured against these standards.  The main downside according to the SBSC economist was that the flat tax was still an income tax which historically has been "high-octane fuel for government spending." <p>
While most small businesses agree that the current tax code is a convoluted mess, the race is still on to convince them that elected officials can design a more fair, less-taxing system.  But as recent surveys show, the flat tax is becoming more popular with business owners and entrepreneurs.  In a recent nationwide survey of 500 small business owners sponsored by SBSC, 56 percent of respondents supported the Armey flat tax proposal.<p>
Powerful interest groups lay waiting in the wings, however, firmly convinced that they
will be severely impacted by the flat tax.  The housing industry, realtors, bankers, accountants and tax attorneys feel they have much to lose under a flat tax system.   Under the Armey flat tax plan, the home mortgage interest deduction would be abolished.  Specter's flat tax (a 20 percent rate) retains the home loan benefit up to $100,000.<p>
To some Washington observers, overhauling the nation's tax system will be politically
impossible.  To others, just being in a political environment where hearings are actually
occurring is a miracle in itself.  Still yet to come is the bottom-line analysis of how the various tax proposals impact the engines of economic growth -- the nation's small businesses.<p>

<title>The Capital Gains Tax Cut Good for Business?</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<center>
<h2><a href="http://www.accf.org">The Capital Gains Tax Cut Good for Business?</a></h2>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
May 1995 - The debate of the 1980's is back, and it is focused on a cut in the capital
gains tax and who benefits from it.  Opponents say it's a big tax cut for the wealthy and will drain the U.S. Treasury.   Supporters contend the cut will benefit everyone by increasing investment, savings, the availability of capital, and tax revenues for the government while decreasing the cost of capital for business investment.<p>
The Republican's Contract With America proposes a reduction in the capital gains tax rate from 28 percent to 19.8 percent by providing for a 50 percent exclusion on capital gains income, and indexing the rate for inflation.  For corporations, there would be an alternative tax rate of 25 percent on capital gains.  The capital gains tax cut in all likelihood will pass the U.S. House of Representatives, but is expected to meet stiff resistance in the Senate.<p>
Partisan sparks flew on the first day of  the Ways and Means Committee tax bill mark-up in the House of Representatives setting the stage for a series of heated and lively debates when the bill hits the floor for a vote.  Minority Leader Richard Gephardt (D-MO) warned that "the Republican tax cuts amount to a massive perk for the privileged, while hard-working middle-class families barely benefit at all."  <p>
Responding to Gephardt, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer (R-TX) said that the Minority Leader was conducting a "misinformation campaign."  The capital gains tax cut measure, included within a $188 billion tax cut proposal for families and businesses, passed the powerful tax writing committee by a 21-14 party-line vote.<p>
What do the experts say about the capital gains tax?  Is it really a tax cut for the rich? 
And, even if it is, does that mean that every one else loses?<p>
<center><b>Economic and U.S. Job Growth</b><p></center>
The U.S. is heavily dependent on its entrepreneurial and small business sector for new job creation.  Over 80 percent of the new jobs in 1993, according to Duns and Bradstreet, were created by small businesses.  But many business owners and entrepreneurs still face a major obstacle to start-up, growth and expansion -- the daunting task of raising capital.  The business advocacy groups in Washington, D.C. favor a capital gains tax cut because it will encourage investment in the small business and entreprenuerial sector. <p>
According to the American Council for Capital Formation (ACCF) Center for Policy
Research, the favorable tax treatment of capital gains is critical to start-up businesses which tend to be riskier investments.  The ACCF Center, in a special report entitled Questions and Answers on Capital Gains, states that most start-up money comes from the family and friends of entrepreneurs.  Lower capital gains taxes encourages these potential investors to risk their savings due to a return in appreciated stock.<p>
High capital gains tax rates significantly cut into potential returns thereby diminishing
incentives to invest.  In the real world of risk-and-reward tradeoffs, the opportunity for high returns must be present in order to entice investment in high-risk ventures, even in new and existing businesses of families and friends.<p>
A examination of venture capital investment in the United States over the past decade has shown a deep decline.  Venture capital was on the rise up to 1986 as the U.S. capital gains tax rate declined; followed by a dramatic downturn as the rate was hiked from 20 percent to 28 percent in 1987 (see chart).  Supporters of reducing and eliminating capital gains tax rates claim that capital would be unlocked, and more capital access to budding and expanding businesses with lower rates.<p>
Critics of  lowering the capital gains tax rate say it will do little for the market,  and
doubts the cut will "free up" capital for investment.  In a paper entitled Another Tax Break for the Wealthy, Dean Baker of the Economic Policy Institute writes that lower tax rates create incentives to hide other income in tax shelters.  Rather than increasing investment in business, a reduction would only add to the tax shelter industry.<p>
<center><b>Capital Gains Tax Spectrum</b><p></center>
A review of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) individual income tax returns show that
capital gains tend to be spread across a wider income spectrum than many believe, or what is reported.  According to 1992 federal income tax returns, 56 percent of returns claiming capital gains were from incomes $50,000 or less, including the capital gain.  Total incomes of $100,000 or less claimed 83 percent of returns with capital gains.<p>

<title>'Contract' Reforms Lift Business Burdens</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<center>
<h2>'Contract' Reforms Lift Business Burdens</h2>  
</center>                                 
<hr>
<br>
April 1995 - Many newly-elected members of the 104th Congress campaigned on a pro-business agenda.  These mostly Republican members of the U.S. House of Representatives, many of whom are small business owners themselves, used the Contract With America as the centerpiece of their campaigns.  What's in store for the business community according to the new Republican majority?  A less-meddlesome, less-regulating, less-taxing federal government.<p>
Already the U.S. House has enacted many of the "Contract" reforms they promised. 
Quite remarkably, most of the legislation to date has easily sailed through the House with the solid support of pro-business Democrats.  But, the most contentious parts of the "Contract" remain, as the House turns to a comprehensive tax relief and spending cuts package.  U.S. Senate passage of many "Contract" provisions also remain in doubt, as Senate leaders say they have their own agenda and timetable for legislation. <p>
Special interests opposed to the "Contract," such as environmental groups, consumer
organizations and the trial lawyers to name a few, have largely focused their lobbying efforts and resources on the upcoming battle in the Senate.<p>
<center><b>Regulatory Relief</b></center><p>   
A comprehensive regulatory reform package,  and a year-long moratorium, or "time-out," on newly proposed regulations easily swept through the House.  Nearly 4,500 new regulations proposed by the Clinton Administration are subject to the moratorium.  The Senate's version of the legislation gives President Clinton the authority to exempt regulations he views as needed to prevent an "imminent" threat to the health and safety of the public.  The Clinton Administration opposes the moratorium. <p>
     Highlights of regulatory reform legislation enacted by the House include:
<ul>
<li>Cost-benefit analysis and risk-assessment standards to be applied to proposed regulations.
<li>The paperwork burden on businesses to be reduced by 10% annually.
<li>Stepped up protection and compensation for private property owners when government regulations reduce the value and use of property.
<li>The Regulatory Flexibility Act, a law already on the books to protect small businesses from excessive regulation, to be strengthened to give small businesses the right to take legal action against the government to enforce the law.
</ul><p>
At a press conference celebrating the passage of reform in the House, regulatory pointman, Majority Whip Tom Delay (R-TX), said the legislation is "the first step toward freedom for millions of individual Americans and hundreds of thousands of job-creating businesses and industries."  <p>
<center><b>Legal Reform</b></center><p>
It seems that if your business involves any risk (which inherently it does) it's not a matter  of when you'll get slapped with a lawsuit, but how much it will cost.  Business interests in Washington played a key role in passing the Common-Sense Legal Reform Act in the House.  The goal behind the legislation, say its supporters,  is to stem the tide of  frivolous law suits, and give business more freedom to do business and pursue innovation.<p>  
Major components of the legislation include:<p>
<ul>
<li>A "loser-pays" rule whereby the losing party in the law suit pays the attorney's fees of the winner.  The amount, however, is limited to the total cost of the loser's own legal fees.
<li>Product Liability:  joint liability for noneconomic damages are abolished under the Act, and a $250,000 cap on punitive damages. 
<li>Lawyer accountability strengthened and "junk-science" testimony disallowed.
<li>Greater protection for growth companies against class-action shareholder law suits.
<li>Written notice must be given to the defendant at least thirty days before a plaintiff can bring suit.  
</ul><p>
<center><b>Tax Relief? What's on the Line for Your Bottom-line</center></b><p>
Remaining "Contract" items of direct consequence to the business and entrepreneurial
sector include a comprehensive tax relief package, coupled with deep spending cuts.  It is shaping up to be the most contentious battle to date in the House.  What's on the line?  Tax cuts for business include:<p>

<center><b>Capital Gains Tax Cut</b></center><p> 
Supporters of the 50 percent cut in, and indexation of the capital gains tax say it will spur economic growth, reduce the cost (while increasing the amount) of capital for investment in small business, and bring in more tax revenues to the federal treasury.  For corporations, there would be an alternative tax rate of 25 percent on capital gains.  Detractors say its a tax cut for the rich, and will drain the treasury.  With class warfare heating up, and widespread support for reducing the deficit, a cut in the capital gains rate may squeak by the House, but looks dimmer every day for passage in the Senate.<p>

<center><b>Home-Office Deduction</b></center><p>  
The tax laws concerning home offices are contradictory and confusing according to many home-office users.  The "Contract" proposal clarifies the deduction for home-offices.  A business owner will qualify if the office is essential to the user's business, is used on an exclusive and regular basis and when tasks in the office cannot be performed elsewhere. <p>

<center><b>Business Expensing</b></center><p>  
The amount small businesses can deduct for equipment purchased in its first year would double to $35,000.  The proposal includes competitive depreciation rules for all businesses under the Neutral Cost Recovery System.  The top-tax writer in the House, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer (R-CA), also determined that the alternative minimum tax should be repealed on a phased-in basis.<p>
<center><b>Estate Tax Exemption</b></center><p>  
The proposal calls for an increase in the exemption from $600,000 to $750,000 to help small businesses pass on a family-owned enterprise to the next generation.  Quite often, the heirs to the family business are forced to sell the business to pay estate taxes under current law. <p>   
<center><b>Paying for the Cuts</center></b><p>
While business likes what it sees on the tax relief and regulatory reform end of the deal,
Republican leaders are bracing for an onslaught of direct lobbying when the spending cuts program is unveiled.    Federal government subsidies to large corporations and industries, as well as the Small Business Administration and other government agencies, are on the chopping block to "pay for" the tax cuts package. <p>
With the public calling for fiscal accountability in government, and many business
owners irked that they have to balance their books to stay in business, lawmakers in  Washington, they contend, should be forced to do the same.  The questions remains as to whether the majority of members in the 104th Congress believe they can reduce the deficit, while providing Americans and businesses with much needed relief.<p>

<P>
Dear Senator ____________:<BR>

<P>
As a small business owner heavily burdened by taxes, I am writing
to urge your support of Senator John Kyl's efforts to eliminate
the federal estate, gift and generation&#173;skipping taxes. 
His &quot;Family Heritage Preservation Act&quot; is long overdue.
 Death taxes must be abolished, nothing less will suffice.<BR>

<P>
I work hard for my family and my employees.  Along the way, I
seem to pay almost every tax imaginable, including income, payroll,
sales and property taxes, not to mention a wide range of fees.
 Naturally, these taxes make it very difficult for me to build
up savings and make additional investment in my business.<BR>

<P>
On top of all this, the government imposes various death taxes.
 It is incomprehensible to me that after paying taxes all my life
&#173;&#173; both personal and business &#173;&#173; the government
could take up to 55% of my buinsess and personal assets.  <BR>

<P>
Please tell me what kind of an incentive I have to continue investing
in and expanding my business?  Indeed, as I get older, why should
I continue in business at all?<BR>

<P>
It is my hope that the business I built will continue on after
I'm gone, hopefully under the guidance of one of my children or
grandchildren.  The federal government's death taxes make this
dream less likely.  It is my understanding that 60% of businesses
fail to make it to a second generation, and 90% don't survive
to a third.  No doubt taxes are a major cause for this dismal
survival rate.  <BR>

<P>
In addition, for all the trouble caused, federal death taxes apparently
count for only 1 percent of federal revenues.  It seems to me
that the government would be far better off getting rid of these
taxes, and thereby encouraging more investment.<BR>

<P>
Again, I urge you to support the &quot;Family Heritage Preservation
Act.&quot;  I don't think it is fair to pay taxes all your life,
and then have the government ask for even more at death.  I believe
that the inherent unfairness of the tax is something reasonable
members of both parties can agree on.  I urge you to repeal this
punitive job-killing tax.<BR>

<htmL><HEAD><title>SBSC Issues:  Davis-Bacon Repeal</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><center><h2>Davis-Bacon Repeal</h2><p><hr size="4" width="45%"></center>
<P>SBSC has fought hard for the repeal of the notorious Davis-Bacon Act.  This Act was enacted six decades ago in an effort to reduce the influx of black southern workers into northern federal construction projects.  The Act grants the federal government power to determine an area's "prevailing wage."  This anti-market provision has resulted in driving the costs of construction up, thereby increasing costs to taxpayers, while simultaneously creating a large paperwork burden.  Davis-Bacon has prevented small construction firms, who cannot afford to pay the inflated prevailing wages, from competing for federal construction projects.  Davis-Bacon has also prevented many contractors from hiring minority and unskilled workers, who are denied employment opportunity due to hiring preferences resulting from Davis-Bacon.
<P>
Davis-Bacon repeal was recently taken out of the Republican budget bill, and some members of Congress wish to strengthen Davis-Bacon (which they mistakingly call "reform") by applying it to off-site construction. The Department of Labor recently imposed Davis-Bacon wage and paperwork requirements on those who build ships for the federal government.  Obviously, it is important that we step up the fight for Davis-Bacon repeal.  
<P><i>See Karen Kerrigan's testimony "<a href="/sbsc/ct2-15-5.html">Repeal of the Davis Bacon Act</a>", or Raymond Keating's "<a href="/sbsc/reg1-5.html">Repeal the Davis Bacon Act</a>" for more information.</i>

<html><head><title>SBSC Issues:  Immigration Reform</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<center><h3> Immigration Reform Act of 1995, S. 1394
<P>
Immigration in the National Interest Act, H.R. 2202</h3><hr width="45%" size="4"><P>
</center>
In the name of immigration reform, the House immigration subcommittee
recently passed H.R. 2202 sponsored by Representative Lamar Smith
(R. TX).  Contrary to the smaller-government principles espoused
by the Republican Congress, H.R. 2202 and similar Senate proposals
(S.269 and S. 1394), increase federal government spending, expand
governmental control over businesses, and will ultimately weaken
the United States' economy.  
<P>
The latest statistical report from the Immigration and Naturalization
Service (INS) noted a drop in United States legal immigration
for the fiscal year 1994.  Ironically, our nation's legislators
and presidential hopefuls believe that illegal immigration and
legal immigration are pressing national problems requiring immediate
and drastic measures.  
<P>
The Senate immigration subcommittee will soon begin markup of
Senator Alan Simpson's (R. WY) legal immigration proposal, S.
1394.  Unfortunately, Senator Simpson's legal immigration legislation
intensifies the restrictive measures of H.R. 2202.
<P>
Senator Simpson seeks a 25% tax on businesses that hire foreign
workers.  Under S. 1394, companies hiring foreign help would have
to pay a tax equal to one-quarter of the employee's annual compensation
including wages and benefits.  In addition, employers would be
forced to pay that employee 105% of the prevailing wage (an expansion
of the job-killing Davis-Bacon Act).
<P>
  Moreover, H.R. 2202 and S. 269 (a similar Senate <I>illegal
</I>immigration proposal authored by Senator Simpson) mandate
another costly regulation on businesses -- employment verification
system.  Analysts estimate that this latest government-imposed
absurdity, will costs U.S. businesses approximately $4.4 billion
dollars.  And analysts predict the system will do nothing to halt
illegal immigration.
<P>
Furthermore, economists predict U.S. businesses will feel the
force of the mandate at least three times: first, when taxes are
raised to pay for the creation of the database; second, when employers
are required to purchase the machinery to operate the verification
system; and third, when employers are denied eligible employees
because of flawed data. 
<P>
The Clinton Administration and sponsors of the immigration reform
measures are expanding big government to unimaginable levels.
<P>
 Unfortunately, the majority of persons who will get caught in
the system will be American citizens, whose right to work should
never be hindered, and the employer, whose right to employ should
never be relinquished to a government entity.
<P>
For more information on the telephone verification system, see
Karen Kerrigan's Small Business Briefing article Worker Database
Could Cost Businesses Billions.

<html><head><title>SBSC Issues:  Independent Contractors</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<center><h2>Independent Contractors</h2><hr width="45%" size="4"><P>
</center>
On June 30, 1995, Representative Jon Christensen (R-NE) introduced
H.R. 1972, the &quot;Independent Contractor Tax Simplification
Act of 1995.&quot;  This piece of legislation seeks to establish
clear criteria for defining the tax status for the self-employed
as independent contractor.  Currently, the IRS subjects numerous
individuals who work autonomously to an infamous 20-factor test.
<P>
 This test challenges the tax status of many of those who choose
to work independently.  Additionally, the ambiguous, subjective
20-factor test may reclassify independent contractors as employees,
causing back-taxes and penalties for the business contracting
with the individual.
<P>
Rep. Christensen's bill would clearly state who is not an employee,
and it allows independent contractors to avoid the 20-factor test.
<P>
 Currently H.R. 1972 is in the House Ways and Means Committee.
<P>
Despite large support from the small business community and many
legislators, this bill requires a continuous effort to ensure
passage.  For more information, see Karen Kerrigan's article &quot;IRS
should revise contract-worker tests.&quot;

<center><h2>Minimum Wage</h2><hr width="45%" size="4">
<p></center>
Congress is once again considering a minimum wage hike.  The Senate recently approved a procedural motion that will bring a minimum wage increase vote within the next several months. The minimum wage, which is politically popular, is most harmful to small businesses.  Most employers pay above the minimum wage, and many determine wages according to the minimum wage.  Thus an increase in the minimum wage will have a ripple effect on the wages paid by businesses - many small firms simply cannot absorb such a budget impact.

<h3>
Time to Overhaul Labor Laws and the NLRB<BR>
</h3>
<P>
<b>
by Raymond J. Keating
<br>
Chief Economist
<br>
Small Business Survival Committee
</b>
<hr>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>
Since its creation in the midst of the Great Depression and the
New Deal, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has been a
source of great controversy.  Depending upon which political party
controlled the White House, therefore controlling the appointment
of the NLRB's five board members, accusations would fly regarding
the NLRB leaning too far in favor of either the rights of workers
or management.  <BR>
<P>
Unfortunately, the controversy created by the NLRB perpetuates
the outmoded notion that business managers/employers and their
employees must always be in conflict.  Under its current modus
operandi, the NLRB hurts both workers and businesses &#173;&#173;
and therefore, the economy in general.<BR>
<P>
The Unfair Labor Practices Controversy.  The NLRB was established
under the National Labor Relations Act (the Wagner Act) of 1935.
 The Board is empowered to conduct and certify elections to determine
if employees desire to be represented by a union, and to prevent
unfair labor practices by both employers and unions or their agents.
 <BR>
<P>
While the Wagner Act and other pieces of federal labor legislation
over the years are usually portrayed as benefitting employees,
in a very real sense, such legislation takes away the individual's
right to contract.  In congressional testimony on February 7,
1996, Richard L. Trumka, Secretary&#173;Treasurer of the AFL&#173;CIO,
asked: &quot;Are we still committed to the right of working men
and women to associate freely?&quot;  Unfortunately, the answer
to this question is &quot;no,&quot; and has been &quot;no&quot;
for decades.  Labor laws &#173;&#173; supported by Mr. Trumka
and his union &#173;&#173; require individuals to join unions
and/or pay union dues, who otherwise would not choose to do so.
 The interests of labor's leaders win out over the interests of
non&#173;union workers and individuals who have no interest in
joining a union.<BR>
<P>
More prominent controversies arise related to the NLRB function
of preventing unfair labor practices.  As James Bovard puts it
in his book Lost Rights: The Destruction of American Liberty:
&quot;In reality, an 'unfair labor practice' is whatever displeases
a majority of the five political appointees to the National Labor
Relations Board.&quot;  Not surprisingly, a body carrying the
title the &quot;National Labor Relations Board&quot; carries an
inherent bias in favor of labor unions.  A cursory examination
of NLRB decisions reveals just such a bias:<BR>
<P>
<ul>
<li> Earlier this year, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals
reversed an NLRB decision which created, according to the Court,
the &quot;imprimatur of industrial anarchy.&quot;  In the Earle
Industries case, the NLRB sanctioned an employer who had disciplined
an employee for escorting a trespasser, activist Jesse Jackson,
through the plant during a union organizing campaign.  The Court
ruled that the employee's interest in unionizing could not override
the employer's interest in protecting its property.1  <BR>
<P>
<li> Again in Lost Rights, James Bovard notes stark differences
in how the NLRB treats employer and union actions: &quot;NLRB
officials have a very expansive concept of coercion when it comes
to management behavior; companies have been found guilty of 'unfair
labor practices' for merely criticizing unions or for offering
raises to their workers before the workers vote on whether to
join a union. ...  Yet the NLRB ruled in July 1993 that a Teamsters
union local affiliate's filing of a $20 million class&#173;action
lawsuit against an employer just before an election was not objectionable
conduct or an unfair labor practice.&quot;  In addition, Bovard
outlines various cases of union violence and the lack of response
by the NLRB.  Bovard concludes:<BR>
</ul>
<P>
&quot;Picketing routinely degenerates into a simple economic blockade
&#173;&#173; an effort to cutoff entrances and exits of the picketed
site.  Thus, it is surprising that the NLRB finds excuses or pretexts
to discount the reality of picket&#173;line violence.&quot;<BR>
<P>
Indeed in certain ways, the NLRB has become a means for perpetuating
union violence and threats.  For example, as reported in SBS Foundation's
Labor Watch (Issue 8), the NLRB apparently forgot the violence
associated with the 1985 strike against the Chicago Tribune stirred
by the hiring of replacement workers.  The strike came to a close
in 1986, and by May 1989, the process of reinstating striking
workers was well under way.  The Pressman's union has since been
seeking the names and addresses of replacement workers still employed
at the Tribune.  The NLRB ordered the Tribune to hand over the
information.  Fortunately, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh
Circuit ensured employee protections and refused to enforce the
NLRB order.  Violence against replacement workers during the strike
included tire slashing, death threats, as well as the stabbing
of a delivery driver.<BR>
<P>
The Clinton NLRB.  President Clinton's NLRB has exhibited overt
favoritism toward the labor union agenda.  Indeed, the NLRB now
has crossed the line from a largely judicial body into the realm
of public&#173;policy advocacy and politics.<BR>
<P>
For example, NLRB Chairman William B. Gould IV has publicly declared
his support for banning the employer's right to hire striker replacements.
 Gould also has denounced the TEAM Act, which would allow employers
and employees to form committees to work together on workplace
issues &#173;&#173; a simple act of teamwork and cooperation that
the NLRB deems in many cases as illegal under the Wagner Act.
<BR>
<P>
Also, the NLRB has proposed implementing a single&#173;site rule,
which carries huge potential benefits for labor unions.  The rule
presumes that a single facility of an employer is the appropriate
bargaining unit under most circumstances.  This makes union organizing
efforts far easier for smaller entities such as restaurant franchises.
 <BR>
<P>
Other recent pro&#173;union NLRB decisions include:
<P>
<ul>
<li> In Manganaro, the NLRB legalized anti&#173;dual shop clauses
which could allow unions to shut down non&#173;union subsidiaries
or impose union membership on non&#173;union workers without a
secret vote.<BR>
<P>
<li> In California Saw, the NLRB virtually neutered employee
Beck rights by letting the unions themselves to decide what are
and are not union political expenses.<BR>
<P>
<li> In Elliott Turbomachinery, the Board gutted property and
ownership rights by ignoring contract language granting an employer
exclusive discretion in relocating its facilities.<BR>
<P>
<li> In Shepard Convention Services, the Board ruled against
its own regulations and ordered a mail ballot election, and then
certified a union even though it was endorsed by only 9 percent
of eligible voters.  This decision was reversed upon appeal, however.
</ul>
<BR>
<P>
In addition, President Clinton made clear the political nature
of the NLRB.  Late last year, the President formally nominated
Senate staffer Sarah M. Fox (Sen. Ted Kennedy's chief labor counsel
on the Labor and Human Resources Committee) to the Board.  Ms.
Fox's pro&#173;union credentials are quite formidable.  She has
been a union lawyer and a key strategist for pro&#173;labor union
legislation.  Knowing this appointment was in grave danger, the
President added Ms. Fox to the Board through a recess appointment
in January.<BR>
<P>
The President reportedly now seeks two Republican appointees to
bring the Board to full complement.  Though, the strong union
ties of the three current Democrat members are no way in doubt.
<BR>
<P>
Reform Measures.  Labor law and the NLRB are in desperate need
of reform in order to protect the rights of individual workers
and business owners.  Ideally, the federal government should extract
itself from involvement in labor issues altogether.  However,
chances of repealing federal labor laws and leaving matters to
the states are currently quite remote, to say the least.  Therefore,
the following principles should lie at the center of labor reform
efforts:<BR>
<P>
<ul>
<li> No individual's right to contract should be subjugated
to other individuals' desires for union representation.  A National
Right to Work law stating that no one should be required to join
a union, nor be forced to pay dues to a union, needs to be passed.
<BR>
<P>
<li> Severe consequences should result from union violence.
 Some argue that the pro&#173;union labor laws of the early half
of this century were implemented in response to employer violence
against union organizers.  In the second half of the twentieth
century, union violence against non&#173;union workers and employers
calls for clear and severe penalties against unions and their
members who participate in and promote violence.  Clearly, the
NLRB should not establish acceptable levels of violence permitted
on picket lines before action is taken (as the Board currently
does).  No degree of violence is acceptable.  The law should be
unequivocal, including decertification of unions involved and
jail time.<BR>
<P>
<li> The NLRB has been reluctant to put an end to union &quot;salting&quot;
campaigns, whereby union organizers apply for jobs at non&#173;union
sites with the intent of either bringing discrimination charges
against the employer to the NLRB, disrupting the workplace, or
running up employer costs.  Such individuals do not seek legitimate
employment, but instead seek to organize and inflict economic
damage.  Clear laws against salting are needed.  <BR>
</ul>
<P>
Put an End to Activist Regulators.  The NLRB is an example of
judicial activism taken to the extreme.  Politically appointed
&quot;judges&quot; have a documented history of making decisions
based on their own views of the world, rather than according to
laws.  The NLRB also exemplifies the general problem with Congress
and the White House delegating powers to regulators and rule&#173;making
bodies.  Indeed, the time has come for our elected officials to
take direct responsibility for the federal regulatory apparatus,
including the NLRB.  The powers of regulators should be clear
and limited, and all rules, regulations, and fines approved by
Congress and the President.<BR>
<P>
In the end, as for the NLRB, its blatantly political and activist
decisions call into question its very existence.  If the federal
government is to remain intertwined in labor issues, then oversight
of elections and initial prevention of unfair labor practices
are reasonable duties that can be carried out with some degree
of objectivity.  However, Congress should give serious consideration
to allowing disputes arising from this process to go directly
to federal courts and eliminating the NLRB's judicial role altogether.

<h3>Costs of Another FDA War:Economic Fallout from Reduced Advertising and Promotional Expenditures</h3><b>by Raymond J. Keating<br>Chief Economist<br>Small Business Survival Committee</b></center><p><hr><p>
Under the generalship of Commissioner David Kessler, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has declared war on a host of businesses and industries.  Recent FDA battles include raids on vitamin clinics and orange juice producers, a pseudo-science attack on silicone breast implants, and a bureaucratic assault on the nation's health and economic vitality through long delays in drug and medical device approvals.1  By outflanking its original mission, now the FDA adds an attack on the tobacco industry to this seemingly ever-growing list.  A question remains: Is this a "just" regulatory war?<p>Considering that tobacco products always have been legally produced and sold in this country and that individual freedom and choice is rightfully cherished in a land of liberty, clearly makes this new FDA regulatory war just as unjust as the battles listed above.  Simply because a handful of elected officials and federal government bureaucrats do not like certain products does not give them the right to rage a regulatory jihad in response.<p>In addition, any just war theory calls for no direct attacks on or injuries or fatalities to non-combatants.  Hence, during wartime, attacks on civilian targets usually generate moral outrage.  In regulatory wars, noncombatants of the economic type always suffer.  The FDA's move against tobacco will have a real and significant impact on noncombatants -- lending even greater weight to the charge of the FDA waging an unjust regulatory war.  Numerous among these noncombatants will be a host of small businesses, including convenience and grocery stores, advertising companies, a variety of manufacturers, print shops -- the list goes on and on.  <p>FDA's Proposed Tobacco Regulations.  According to the Federal Register, the FDA proposed tobacco regulations include prohibiting cigarette vending machines, free samples, mail-order sales, and self-service displays; limiting advertising and labeling "which children and adolescents are exposed to" to black-and-white, text-only formats; no advertis
ing within 1,000 feet of a school or playground; banning the sale or distribution of branded non-tobacco items such as hats and t-shirts; and restrict sponsorship of events to the corporate name only, not the tobacco product brand name.  Also, the proposed regulations would federalize 18 years as the legal age for purchasing tobacco products and require that manufacturers fund anti-smoking educational campaigns.  <p>Specifically, the FDA's stated goal is to cut youth smoking by half within seven years, and if not achieved, then taking unspecified, additional steps.  Of course, the impact of these measures would reach well beyond any youth market and raises worrisome questions about the FDA's long-term goals relating to the tobacco industry.  After all, an August 1995 report by the FDA declared "that nicotine in cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products is a drug, and that these products are drug delivery devices within the meaning of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act."  If true, the criminalization of tobacco products production and distribution must be a real possibility.  One has to wonder: Is the FDA seeking prohibition with all its commensurate woes?<p>For the short term, though, this FDA effort is essentially based on the highly questionable notion that advertising has a significant impact on youth decisions to smoke -- much more so than the more likely influences of peer pressure and family life.  The FDA also assumes that the federal government should, and can, direct the personal tastes and habits of Americans.  As in other cases where the nanny state runs amok, real and significant economic costs are incurred.<p>
<b>FDA Faulty Estimates</b>  According to an economic analysis performed for the Small Business Survival (SBS) Foundation by the American Economics Group, Inc.2,  the FDA's projections of potential job losses due to these regulatory proposals are grossly underestimated.  The FDA asserts that approximately 1,000 jobs annually would be lost in the tobacco warehouse, manufacturer, grower, and wholesaler sectors for about 10 years.  While a ten-year total of 10,000 jobs lost is nothing to gloss over, the American Economics Group report notes that this amounts falls far short of the actual numbers: "Incredibly, the FDA does not include a job loss estimate for the sectors that would be most vulnerable to its regulations -- the advertising, manufacturing and retail industries."<p>Substantive Cost Estimates.  The American Economics Group study for SBS Foundation examined the sales, employment, and wage impact of promotional and advertising expenditures by tobacco firms and found the following:<p>
<ul>
<li> Based on 1993 numbers, direct spending on advertising and promotion by tobacco companies employs an estimated 78,836 workers in the United States, and by the time you factor in the additional activity generated by these individuals, "the cycle of buying, all begun by tobacco advertising and promotion, continues until ... 209,112 persons are employed as a result."<p><li> Direct advertising and promotion purchases by tobacco firms amounted to more than $6.1 billion in 1993, with total generated purchases topping $17.9 billion.  Direct wages and salaries amounted to more than $1.9 billion, and "subsequent activity" generated more than $3.2 billion for a total of over $5.2 billion in wages and salaries in 1993.<p>
<li> Direct advertising and 
promotion expenditures by tobacco firms fall into 11 major industry categories -- food products and tobacco, apparel, printing and publishing, rubber and leather products, instruments and related products, miscellaneous manufacturing industries, transportation, wholesale trade, retail trade, business services, and miscellaneous services.  Subsequent derived expenditures impact 37 different industry groups.<p>
<li> The proposed FDA tobacco 
regulations place much of these advertising and promotional expenditures at risk, and therefore, the businesses -- many small, entrepreneurial firms -- tied into such activity as well.  <p>
<li> In terms of lost jobs, the report concludes that about 45,000 full and part time direct jobs and at least 65,000 derived jobs could be lost over a three to five year period.  This job loss estimate is 11 times the FDA's estimate.  And it should be remembered that these American Economics Group estimates only count jobs related to a decline in advertising and promotional expenditures by tobacco firms due to the proposed regulations, and not additional job losses due to any kind of decline in the purchase of tobacco products.  <p>
</ul><b>Excess Regulation Hurts the Economy</b><p>
  If a federal government agency is going to declare war on any industry with increased oversight and regulation, then a full accounting of the potential damage should be undertaken.  Increased federal regulation is not a costless endeavor.  Regulations have the same impact as taxes -- raising the costs of investing, risk taking, and generally "doing business."  These costs translate into less investing and entrepreneurship, lower profitability, increased chances of business failure (especially for smaller firms operating on a razor's edge), and less employment.  Therefore, federal agencies like the FDA have a responsibility to realistically examine the costs and benefits of their regulatory initiatives.
  <p>Unfortunately, when 
undertaking a regulatory jihad, FDA officials fail to even concern themselves with proper jurisdiction -- tobacco regulation has never fallen within the FDA's regulatory domain -- never mind real costs.  Orange juice producers, vitamin clinics, medical device firms, drug companies, and now tobacco-related businesses -- more and more industries are being sucked into the FDA's unjust regulatory wars.

<h3>Costs of Another FDA War:Attack on Vending Machines, An Attack on Jobs and Small Business</h3><b>by Raymond J. Keating<br>Chief Economist<br>Small Business Survival Committee</b></center><p><hr><p>

In the <a href="/sbsc/rw-fdaw1.html">first installment</a> in this three-part series, it was noted that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) proposed tobacco regulations could cost the economy -- at minimum -- an estimated 110,000 jobs over a three to five year period.1  This far outpaces the FDA's own estimate of 10,000 jobs over ten years.  The FDA failed to account for the full cost of its proposed legislation.
<P>One industry hit particularly hard by the proposed regulations is vending services.  Under the proposed FDA tobacco regulations, the sale of cigarettes through vending machines would be completely banned.  
<P>In a recent Wall Street Journal article ("If Cigarette Industry Coughs, Remote Areas Expect to Catch Cold," October 26, 1995), Mark Stomel, the owner of a vending machine company, noted who would be hurt by such a ban: "The man that fills the vending machines, the mechanic that fixes them, the people who do the maintenance of the vehicles. ... It spreads like wildfire."  He also reported that 25 percent of Stomel Vending Co.'s sales would be wiped out.
<P>The National Automatic Merchandising Association (NAMA) reports that cigarettes and tobacco sales represent 7.1 percent of sales by automatic merchandise machine operators, and a ban on these sales would mean thousands of lost jobs.
<P>The FDA claims that it has undertaken this regulatory assault on tobacco in order to cut youth smoking in half in seven years.  The FDA assumes that an end to cigarette distribution through vending machines will greatly assist this effort.  However, NAMA's numbers tell a different story.  <P>
<ul>
<LI> Cigarette purchasing habits of individuals ages 13 through 17:<P>				Convenience stores		43%				Gas stations			29%				Grocery stores			11%				Vending machines		  9%				Drug stores			  6%<P>

<LI> Location of vending 
machines:<P>		Locales rarely frequented by minors		77.5%			Bars, cocktail lounges		31%			Industrial plants		27%			Offices				12%			Hotels/Motels			  4%			Universities/Colleges		  3.5%		
Other Locales					22.5%			Restaurants			13%			Terminals, Rec - Bowling Centers, misc.	  9.5%			   <P>These numbers raise serious questions regarding the FDA's efforts.  Meanwhile, such a highly questionable undertaking presents real risks to an industry completely dominated by small businesses.  Vending Times reports that 26 percent of vending service providers are one-person (or family-only) establishments; 15 percent have only one part-time employee; another 28 percent claim 1-3 full-time employees; and 10 percent have 3.5-5 full-time employees.  In total, an incredible 90 percent of all vending firms employ less than 20 employees.  The survival of many of these firms is placed in jeopardy due to the proposed ban of cigarette sales through vending machines by the FDA.  </ul>
<P>While the FDA should not be involved in tobacco regulation at all, the aforementioned numbers addressing the purchasing habits of young smokers and the location of vending machines, show that little, if anything, would be gained on the youth smoking front by banning vending machines and throwing small businesses into turmoil.  The job of stopping youth smoking -- a goal worth supporting -- falls to parents, not federal government bureaucrats in Washington, D.C.  Governmental social engineering always fails -- and at great cost to the taxpayer, business, and the economy.<P><hr><P><center><b>End Notes</b></center><P>

<h3>FDA Facts: Exporting Entrepreneurship</h3><b>by Raymond J. Keating<br>Chief Economist<br>Small Business Survival Committee</b></center><p><hr><p>

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has become the model of a plodding, costly, and even deadly government bureaucracy.  The agency remains infamous for its ability to throw monkey wrenches into the machinations of some of the most dynamic industries of the late twentieth century, such as medical devices and pharmaceuticals.  Indeed, the FDA is slowing medical progress, hampering entrepreneurial enterprises, and destroying jobs due to regulatory obstacles and bureaucratic gridlock.	The FDA seems more intent on exporting American ingenuity and entrepreneurship, rather than encouraging the production of U.S.-made drugs and medical devices.	
<p>
FDA Responsibilities.  The FDA carries a long list of responsibilities, summarized as: regulating drug, food, cosmetics, biological product, and medical device labeling; approving new drugs, biological products, and medical devices; setting drug, biological product and medical device manufacturing guidelines; and establishing safety and effectiveness standards for drugs, biological products, and medical devices.	
<p>
To implement this ambitious agenda, the FDA staff totaled 9,217 in 1994, up from 1,678 in 1960 -- an increase of 449 percent.1  In 1994, the FDA's gross budget authority equaled $935.7 million.2	
<p>
<b>FDA vs. Entrepreneurs</b>
<p>
  As is the case with most regulatory agencies, the FDA seemed like a good idea at first, but it has grown into a massive, misguided undertaking.  The FDA has placed enormous burdens on the food, pharmaceutical, and medical device industries -- discouraging investment and risk taking in some of America's leading industries.	Examples of the havoc being wrought by the FDA abound:<p>
<ul>
<li> In the August/September 1995 issue of Reason magazine, Rick Henderson reported that "the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health takes more than three times longer to approve a Class III or 'substantial risk' medical device (such life-saving products as heart valves or CAT scanners) than do the agency's counterparts in Europe."  The impact of such delays?  "In the past 10 months, reports a survey published in June by the Health Industry Manufacturers Association, 50 percent of the more than 500 device makers surveyed had moved some clinical trials of new medical devices overseas; 56 percent refused to test new devices on Medicare patients; and 75 percent planned to move their trials to Europe."	
<p>
Henderson also noted, "The average time it takes a drug company to develop and gain approval of a new drug has almost doubled over the past 30 years -- from 8.1 years in the 1960s to 14.5 years today.  And, reports the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America ... more than 60 percent of new drugs and biologics (genetically engineered pharmaceuticals) approved here in the 1990s were first approved in another country."<p>

<li> Thomas G. Donlan noted industry trends driven by the FDA's regulatory maze in the July 3, 1995 issue of Barron's: "The failure of U.S. regulation can ... be seen in the scrambles that have roiled the industry to put research and manufacturing offshore, to make partnerships with foreign drug firms and to merge and merge and merge again in an attempt to create firms that are large enough to weather all the risks of regulation."	Of course, market-driven mergers in an industry are by no means worrisome.  However, substantial industry changes being driven by regulatory costs should cause regulators and their supposed overseers -- i.e., elected officials -- to re-evaluate their regulatory activities.<p>

<li> Robert Higgs, in a report for the Competitive Enterprise Institute, noted the hurdles companies face even when making improvements in already existing products or in their manufacturing processes: "Changes in the product or the manufacturing process, no matter how small, might cause the product to be consigned to an indefinite stay in preapproval purgatory.  FDA failed to differentiate between new devices and manufacturing changes for existing devices.  Manufacturers therefore had a reduced incentive to make the minor improvements that, cumulating over time, could greatly improve the performance of their products and the efficiency of their manufacturing operations."<p>

<li> Higgs also reported that FDA policies and conduct have boosted costs for medical device firms considerably -- perhaps adding $10 million to $20 million to a firm's budget, as well as several additional years before a new device gets to the market.  Such costs greatly reduce venture capital investment in new and expanding enterprises making medical devices.  One can only speculate as to the total number of potentially life-saving innovations and inventions that fail to reach consumers because regulatory costs reduce potential returns to such an extent that capital simply dries up.	In addition, Higgs noted that from 1989 to 1991, U.S. medical technology firms invested roughly the same amount abroad annually -- $321 million-$333 million.  "Then in 1992, when FDA abruptly made its enforcement and approval policies more onerous, capital outflow jumped more than 200 percent to $993 million."<p>

<li> One also has to wonder whether large firms feel the FDA's battering as severely as smaller and start-up enterprises.  Rick Henderson asserts in Reason that large, established pharmaceutical companies have benefited from the FDA's regulatory maze.  New, smaller firms lack the resources, expertise, and patience to surf the FDA's regulatory tidal wave.  Hence, entrepreneurs wipe out -- the system results in fewer competitors for established firms.<p>

<li> A 1993 report from the House Energy and Commerce Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee acknowledged the woes tied to the FDA's approval process for medical devices: "The situation is intolerable.  The backlog for pending device applications exceeds 1,100. ... The FDA's enforcement practices have demoralized and perplexed much of the medical device industry."3  <p>

<li> In testimony before the House Joint Economic Committee Hearing on Technical Innovations in Health Care on June 24, 1994, Robert C. DeHaven of the American Electronics Association declared that the FDA's "inordinately slow" regulatory process was threatening "the global competitiveness" of the medical device industry -- a $70 billion industry with more than 11,000 companies.<p>

<li> A recent American Electronics Association survey reportedly found that 40 percent of medical device firms reduced their number of U.S. employees because of FDA delays, 29 percent boosted investment in foreign operations, and 22 percent moved U.S. jobs out of the country.4  <p>

<li> FDA approval times have mounted.  For example, in 1988, it took an average of 78 days for the FDA to approve a product change (i.e., a 510-K application); by 1992, approval time had grown to an average of 126 days.5  This number further ballooned to 173 to 213 days by 1994.6   These applications are supposed to be approved within 90 days, according to FDA guidelines.  		Approvals of new devices take anywhere from 437 to 840 days.7  New device approvals, however, are supposed to be completed within 180 days.	Meanwhile, the median approval time for generic drug applications stretched out from 12 months to 38 months between 1986 and 1993.8  Of course, all of these numbers exclude FDA requirements placed on firms that extend development time.<p>

<li> The chief executive of the Minnesota-based Minntech Corp., Louis Cosentino, best summed up the effect of the FDA on entrepreneurs and the U.S. economy: "The attitude of the FDA is so antibusiness and so negative at this point that any prudent CEO has to be looking outside the U.S. as a safe haven."  Minntech laid off 50 Minnesota employees while expanding in Europe.9  <p>	

Meanwhile, the so-called benefits for consumers from all these added delays and costs remain difficult to detect.  In fact, bureaucratic delays by the FDA apparently cost tens of thousands of lives annually, as products and treatments are being denied to American consumers.	Export Restrictions.  Adding insult to injury, the FDA erects barriers to the export of U.S. medical products as well.  Even if a product has been approved for use in a foreign country, the FDA generally does not allow for exportation to that nation if the product has not received FDA approval.  Again, in the case of medical devices, a lengthy FDA approval process is needed in order to export.10  	

The CEO of a medical device company was denied permission to export by the FDA -- so he moved the company from the U.S. to Switzerland.  The CEO observed: "The FDA denied us permission to export. ... So we had to export our manufacturing plant."11  	
</ul>
<P>
<b>Entrepreneurs in the Regulatory Process?</b>
<P>
  One can at least be somewhat encouraged by the fact that the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives recognizes the many woes of the FDA.  In fact, Speaker Newt Gingrich went so far as to refer to the FDA as a "Stalinistic" agency and the "leading job killer" in the nation.12  Under the FDA's yoke, entrepreneurs and businesses possess every incentive to cease research and development, shift operations and jobs out of the country, or close down operations altogether.	
<p>
Congress needs to take bold steps.  Reports about FDA incompetence, abrasiveness, gridlock, intrusions, and costs are so numerous that they lead one to believe that more than mere reform is required.  Former U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan pointed in the right direction when he wrote in the June 27, 1995 Washington Times: "Instead of making yet another effort to reform a system that seems incapable of reform, we should begin thinking about the design of a new system.  In my view, such a system would require considerable decentralization, perhaps along the lines of the European systems, where non-government institutions play a much greater role in the process of reviewing and approving new medical products."	
<p>
According to economist James Bovard writing in the December 8, 1994 
Wall Street Journal: "Rep. Gingrich favors replacing the FDA with an agency staffed with medical entrepreneurs, with strict limits on their time in government."  While one has to wonder why entrepreneurs would be willing to staff a government agency, the sentiment is correct.  In addition, this addresses a nagging question regarding the FDA: Can regulators ever be qualified enough to register sound judgments regarding such dynamic industries as biomedical companies?  Tapping medical entrepreneurs is a good idea, but would be better achieved by allowing private firms to undertake FDA safety approvals.  Meanwhile, efficacy should be left to the marketplace.	
<p>
>b>Global Competition</b>
<P>
  The FDA is taking a heavy toll on the U.S. economy in terms of lost entrepreneurship, investment, jobs, and international competitiveness.  In a world where both capital and labor can move with increasing ease and freedom, the U.S. regulatory regime is operating within an increasingly competitive global environment.  An agency that delays the approvals of beneficial drugs and medical devices to the degree that the FDA does ensures that U.S.-based firms operate at a severe disadvantage.  Of course, not only does this mean less investment, slower economic growth, and fewer jobs, but it also means that U.S. consumers often are denied access to life-saving  devices and treatments.  	
<p>
Competition can do wonders.  The U.S. regulatory regime acts as a severe drag on our economy.  Congress must act to make the U.S. food and drug regulatory environment more competitive on the world stage, or continue to lose cutting-edge firms and high-paying jobs to other nations.

<h3>FDA Facts: Strong-Arming American Business</h3><b>by Raymond J. Keating<br>Chief Economist<br>Small Business Survival Committee<p></b></center><hr>
<p>		
In the previous Small Business Reg Watch 1995, "FDA Facts: Exporting Entrepreneurship," the Small Business Survival Committee examined many of the costs and delays that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration  (FDA) imposes on firms in the medical device and pharmaceutical industries.  As a result, enterprises have either cut back on research and development, moved operations out of the country, or simply closed their doors.	However, the FDA does not stop at mere incompetence and bureaucratic gridlock.  In the 1990s, under the guidance of FDA Commissioner David Kessler, the FDA's enforcement efforts have become increasingly aggressive and intrusive.  One might say that the FDA has been strong-arming U.S. businesses.	FDA Intrusions.  Reports abound of the FDA's move to more aggressive and confrontational methods under Dr. Kessler's reign.  For example:<p>
<ul>
<li> In the May 1995 issue of Reason magazine, analyst Alexander Volokh reported: "Since 1990, when David Kessler took over as FDA commissioner, enforcement has been one of the FDA's top priorities.  In his first two months, Kessler added 100 new criminal investigators to his enforcement staff, many of them formerly with the Secret Service and Drug Enforcement Administration.  Armed raids on alternative health clinics and dietary supplement dealers followed, as well as increased warning letters, product seizures, and criminal prosecutions in the drug and device industries."<p>

<li> In the January 1995 issue of The American Spectator ("Double-Crossing to Safety"), James Bovard reported on the FDA's raid on Proctor & Gamble's "Citrus Hill Fresh Choice" orange juice.  The FDA disputed the use of the word "fresh" on the label, saying it was misleading.  Proctor & Gamble noted a survey showing that consumers knew that "Fresh Choice" did not mean fresh squeezed, and besides, "Made from Concentrate" was also on the label.  Bovard reports: "Kessler ... took sweeping action: He ordered U.S. marshalls to seize the juice -- 12,000 gallons, as it turned out -- and destroy it.  Federal law declares that a 'misbranded' or 'mislabeled' product is automatically unsafe, and provides FDA with the authority to confiscate the merchandise."<p>	

Naturally, the orange juice was perfectly safe, not to mention healthy.  Dr. Kessler action was meant to send a message to American businesses that the FDA was calling the shots.<p>

<li> Bovard noted another, similar raid.  This time it wasn't orange juice, but vitamins the FDA was after: "On May 6, 1992, a platoon of sixteen FDA inspectors and local police in flak jackets carried out a no-knock raid, smashing in the door of the Tahoma Clinic in Kent, Washington.  They held the staff at gunpoint, ostensibly so that nobody could try to hide the vitamins.  The raiders seized more than $100,000 in products and office supplies -- including address books and diaries -- and spent 14 hours cleaning out the office; they even tore the phones out of the wall.  FDA agents were supposedly concerned about the clinic's use of injected B-vitamins, which have been widely used in Germany with no adverse health problems."<p>

<li> Commissioner Kessler was appointed by President George Bush.  Refusing to resign from his post under a directive given to all presidential appointees during a normal transition to a new administration, Kessler worked hard to ingratiate himself with the president-to-be with a list of aggressive regulatory actions.  On December 8, 1992, during the White House transition, Kessler offered his view of the FDA in remarks before the Food and Drug Law Institute's 36th Annual Educational Conference.  His emphasis on re-regulation and more aggressive enforcement was clear, as noted by the following excerpts:<p>"We needed to send out a message that, ultimately, it was in no one's interest to deregulate a public health regulatory agency."<p>"We're paying more attention to our field these days.  We've become once again an FDA that vigorously enforces the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, and not just an agency that approves products and educates consumers and the industry."<P>"Our enforcement people have fewer hoops to jump through, fewer boxes that must be checked off."<p>"We rely much less on voluntary agreements and much more on court-enforceable consent decrees."<p>"To complement the regular FDA field force we've created an Office of Criminal Investigations, not to be confused with the new Office of Investigations.  Thirty new special agents began intense training last week at a federal law enforcement training 	center in Georgia."<p>"In just over a year we've cleared the deck of uncompleted and abandoned regulatory proposals; we're getting new regulations out faster than ever before ..."<p>	Commissioner Kessler, of course,  kept his job.<p>

<li> This time writing in The Wall Street Journal (December 8, 1994), James Bovard observed another FDA tactic: "FDA employees are also sowing fear with a deluge of official Warning Letters (up more than 300% since Dr. Kessler took office).  Once the FDA issues a Warning Letter, it can seize a company's products or get a court injunction to paralyze its operations.  The FDA has refused to establish clear guidelines or rules for issuing its letters.  As a result, manufacturers can find themselves in a nightmare at the whim of a mid-level FDA employee."<p>

<li> In a letter to The American Spectator (April 1995), Dennis Plank, Editor-Publisher of the FDA Hotline, writes on how well federal regulatory agencies work together when it comes to regulatory crack downs: "A frightening current trend is how successful the FDA has become in pushing the buttons at other federal agencies to attack vitamin, supplement, and herbal manufacturers and suppliers.  We have reported on stepped-up enforcement actions by OSHA, FTC, Customs, Postal Service, and the DEA.  The Federal Trade Commission has now become the FDA's bully boy with no less than twenty cases pending against vitamin and natural product manufacturers."<p>

<li> One of the FDA's most aggressive moves just occurred.  It did not involve a physical raid on a company's facilities.  Instead, it amounts to the beginnings of a power raid on an entire American industry.  According to published reports, on Wednesday, July 12, 1995, the FDA declared nicotine to be a drug, linking this conclusion to concern over tobacco products being sold to minors.  	

<p>Of course, it is currently illegal to sell tobacco products to minors.  In reality, the FDA's declaration of nicotine as a drug lays the ground work for extensive control over the manufacturing and distribution of tobacco products by the FDA.  	Most recognize that smoking is bad for your health, as are so many other undertakings.  Tobacco, like other things, is a legally grown, packaged, and sold product in the United States.  What happens now that the FDA is calling nicotine a drug?  Are tobacco farmers and convenience store owners to become outlaws, part of organized crime, or perhaps pharmacists?  Are the FDA's enforcement tactics, as described above, to be extended to tobacco farms and convenience stores?  What about smokers?  The effect of the FDA calling nicotine a drug goes well beyond concern over youth smoking -- it is an issue of extending the control of the nanny state.	

<p>Indeed, why stop at nicotine?  What about other habit forming substances?  I'm overweight and enjoy drinking caffeine-laden beverages.  Will the FDA soon classify cheeseburgers, caffeine, and sugar as drugs -- how about hot dogs?<p>	

As government agencies often do, the FDA has proven to be both hypocritical and incompetent.  If Dr. Kessler and the FDA truly cared about the public's health, they would improve the efficiency of their medical device and drug approval processes.  Unfortunately, Dr. Kessler's reign seems more about control.<p>	
</ul><P>

<b>A Return to Safety Approvals and Education</b>
<P>
  The list of FDA abuses continues.  The time has come to rein in what has become largely a personal crusade. Much to the chagrin of FDA Commissioner Kessler, the FDA indeed should be "just an agency that approves products and educates consumers and the industry."  In the regulatory environment, anything more seems to breed hostility, often insurmountable costs, over-zealousness, arrogance, and massive intrusions on the part of regulators -- such as seizures of orange juice and armed raids on vitamin clinics.  The FDA's philosophy should not be one of making an example of a company in order to send a signal to other firms.  Instead, it should be one of cooperation with some of America's most dynamic and crucial industries.  	

<p>In light of potential litigation costs, lost profits, and the possibility of going out of business, firms in the medical device, food, and drug industries possess every incentive to produce safe products.  As usual, the market offers its own system of checks and balances.	

<p>Entrepreneurs in the medical device, pharmaceutical, and food industries are meeting the most essential human needs -- food and medical care.  The costs and risks of improving upon and/or creating new products in such areas remain substantial.  Unfortunately, the FDA has managed to significantly add to these costs -- not only through delays and additional regulatory requirements, but through unpredictable, intrusive actions, as touched upon in this paper.    Entrepreneurs are not the enemy; they are the driving force behind society's great leaps in technology, new products and services -- not the FDA.  	

<p>Former U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Louis Sullivan was correct when he recently observed in The Washington Times (June 27, 1995) that the FDA "seems incapable of reform."  The FDA needs to be scrapped in favor of a smaller agency geared toward safety and education, with  a food, medical device, and pharmaceutical safety approval process largely contracted out to private-sector firms.<hr>

<h3>FDA Facts: Spending More to Get Less</h3><b>by Raymond J. Keating<br>Chief Economist<br>Small Business Survival Committee</b></center><p><hr><p>

Delays in  medical device and drug approvals by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have become infamous.  As noted in the <a href="rw-fda1.html">first installment</a> in this short series, for example, new device approvals now take anywhere from 437 days to 840 days, and approvals for mere changes in existing products take an average of 173 days to 213 days.  These periods compare with the required approval times of 180 days and 90 days, respectively.  Median time for approving new drugs tops three years -- 38 months in 1993 vs. 12 months in 1986 -- with the average time stretching out even farther.  Meanwhile, the total time to develop and gain FDA approval of a new drug has risen from an average of 8.1 years in the 1960s to 14.5 years today.	When confronted with such a dismal and costly performance record, FDA defenders will say that the agency is in need of more resources.  A quick look at FDA budget and employment levels tells quite a different story.	FDA Budget.  Figure 1 provides a glimpse at the FDA's budget authority for select years since 1955 in inflation-adjusted 1994 dollars.  To say the least, budget growth at the FDA has been robust.  For example:<p>
<ul>
<li> Just from 1989 to 1994, real FDA budget authority increased by 
52.6 percent -- or by an average annual real rate of more than 10.5 percent.
<P>
<li> Between 1970 and 1994, real FDA budget authority increased by 221.1 percent.
<P>
<li> And between 1955 and 1994, the FDA's real budget authority rose by 2,978 percent.  Though the FDA's powers were enhanced considerably in the early 1960s, an average annual boost in real FDA budget dollars since 1955 of more than 76 percent cannot be justified.<p>
</ul><P>

<b>FDA Employees</b>
Figure 2 illustrates the growth in employment at the FDA.  Again, a shortage of manpower does not seem to plague the agency.  For example:<p>
<ul>
<li> Between 1989 and 1994, FDA full-time employees grew by a substantial 25.3 percent.
<P>
<li> Between 1970 and 1994, FDA full-time employees increased by 115.7 percent.
<P>
<li> And between 1955 and 1994, full-time employees at the FDA increased by 933.4 percent.	
</ul><P>

<b>Incentives Problem</b>
<P>
 Considering the great leaps in real budget authority and employment at the FDA, it would seem quite a stretch of the imagination to believe that the FDA lacks sufficient resources.  Instead, what the FDA lacks are proper incentives -- as is the case with most government undertakings.  Costs and performance in government -- unlike the private sector -- take a back seat to concerns over expanding power, budgets, and employment.   Also, given the fact that the FDA suffers when an approved product fails, but garners little attention for the woes brought on by its own delays, the agency's incentives to prolong its approval process remain clear.   Taxpayers and consumers are spending more to get less from the FDA.  FDA delays, added costs, export restrictions, narrow-minded regulations, bigger budgets, and overly aggressive regulators are costing the United States in terms of lost businesses, jobs, and even lives.  Real reform means reduced costs and improved performance.  Such an outcome can only materialize if private-sector involvement in the safety of U.S. food, drugs, and medical devices is enhanced.<p><hr><P>

<h2>Repeal the Davis-Bacon Act</h2>
<h3>by Raymond J. Keating</h3>
</center>
<hr>
<p>
"By imposing high wages and restrictive work practices on nearly any federally funded construction project, the Davis-Bacon Act costs taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars in excess construction fees every year -- and freezes tens of thousands of unskilled workers out of jobs."<p>
 
--Eugene H. Methvin, "<i>A Scandalous Law That's Costing Taxpayers Millions</i>," Reader's Digest,  December 1994
<p>
"Davis-Bacon increases costs to such an extent on federally-funded construction contracts that most small businesses are effectively precluded from bidding -- limiting competition and further raising costs for taxpayers."<p>
  --Karen Kerrigan, President, SBSC<p>
<hr>
<p>
Should the United States Congress and President Clinton repeal a regulatory act that denies opportunity to lower-income workers; panders to special interests; claims some racist origins; increases costs to taxpayers and the economy; and hurts small business?  Of course, the answer should be a resounding "yes."  The Davis-Bacon Act of 1931 does all of the above, and therefore, should be repealed.<p>
The Davis-Bacon Act requires that contractors on federally-funded construction contracts in excess of $2,000 pay workers what is termed "prevailing wage" in the region.  Supporters claim that Davis-Bacon was passed to ensure that local labor standards prevailed and local wages were not driven lower.  Most others tell another story.<p>
 
<h3>Pandering to Organized Labor and Racism</h3>

In a December 1994 Reader's Digest article, Eugene H. Methvin writes that Davis-Bacon was a "cruel relic of the Jim Crow era."  He points out that Davis-Bacon "was born in the Great	Depression year of 1931, after an Alabama contractor had submitted the low bid to build a veterans hospital on New York's Long Island and hired black laborers who had been largely shut out of the higher-wage construction unions."  New York Representative Robert L. Bacon and Pennsylvania Senator James J. Davis introduced the bill to block lower wages, and President Herbert Hoover signed it -- limiting the benefits of competition, while pandering to organized labor and racism.<p>
Just as was the case in the 1930s, low-income earners, limiting competition especially inner-city minorities, continue to be hurt by the Davis-Bacon Act.  Less-skilled, generally non-union workers are denied economic opportunity as Davis-Bacon inflates wages beyond the point where it makes economic sense for contractors to employ such inndividuals.<p>

<h3>Damaging Small Business</h3>

Small businesses are particularly hurt by the Davis-Bacon Act.  Government-determined "prevailing wages" often well exceed the actual prevailing wages in an area.  In an effort that even central planners in the former Soviet Union might have shied away from, the Department of Labor makes tens of thousands of wage determinations annually to guide Davis-Bacon contracts.  Of course, these estimates tend to be arbitrary, dated, and/or rely solely on union rates.  Many small businesses cannot afford to pay these government-imposed higher wage rates.  In particular, small businesses in inner-cities, who are willing to provide critical experience to less-skilled workers, are denied that opportunity due to government wage rates that do not reflect economic reality.<p>

In addition, the paperwork requirements associated with Davis-Bacon take a particularly heavy toll on small contractors.  In 1934, the Copeland Act was passed requiring employers on Davis-Bacon contracts to submit payroll records to the Department of Labor or contracting agency on a weekly basis.  This requirement forces many small contractors to higher additional clerical employees, invest in additional equipment, and/or alter their payroll schedules.  The result: higher costs that discourage small contractors from bidding on Davis-Bacon contracts.<p>

As these higher costs exclude many small businesses from bidding on Davis-Bacon contracts, costs to taxpayers are pushed even higher due to limited competition.<p>


<h3>Costs to Taxpayers and the Economy</h3>

This lack of competition, increased paperwork, and inflated wages, of course, translate into higher costs for taxpayers and the economy.  Various estimates of the increase in total construction costs due to the Davis-Bacon Act have been made, including:<a href="#foot1">1</a><p>
<ul>
<li>According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) in 1993, if Davis-Bacon were repealed and Copeland Act requirements lifted, federal taxpayers would have saved $3 billion over the following five years.                                                         
<li>The Department of Defense estimated in the mid-1980s that Davis-Bacon induced an added cost premium of 5 percent.
<li>In 1979, the General Accounting Office (GAO) estimated an average cost inflation of 3 percent to 10 percent tied to Davis-Bacon.
<li>Some local officials have estimated that Davis-Bacon increased the cost of various community development projects by 20 percent to 50 percent.  Also, an Oregon State University study estimated cost inflation on federally-funded construction contracts in rural areas of 26 percent to 38 percent due to the Davis-Bacon Act.
<li>The GAO and CBO estimates do not include the costs of foregone competition -- raising the total cost of Davis-Bacon even higher.
</ul>

In addition, part of the Davis-Bacon rationale was to protect local workers from contractors outside the region.  Yet, as noted in a 1986 study by Armand J. Thieblot for the Wharton School, local contractors have gained a larger share of private contracts than they do Davis-Bacon contracts.<p>

Also, the Davis-Bacon Act spawned numerous state-level imitators -- placing similar requirements on state and local government contracts.  Just as does the federal Davis-Bacon Act, these state acts raise costs for taxpayers, deny economic opportunity to many less-skilled workers, and damage small business.<p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

Wages are best determined in a competitive marketplace, not according to the unrealistic estimates from Department of Labor bureaucrats in Washington, D.C.  The market allows wages and costs to adjust according to a host of criteria, including competition, skill levels and productivity, demand, supply, capital investment, et al.  The Davis-Bacon Act's wage criteria distorts the marketplace -- artificially favoring large businesses over small, entrepreneurial firms; and higher-skilled and paid workers over less-experienced, lower-skilled workers independent of job criteria.  Costs rise; the entrepreneur suffers; unemployment increases; and taxpayers foot the bill.<p>

The Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC) supports the straightforward remedy proposed by U.S. Representative Tom Delay (R-Tx.) to the many problems created by the Davis-Bacon Act.  Rep. Delay's bill simply reads: "Davis-Bacon of March 3, 1931 (known as the Davis-Bacon Act) is repealed."<p>

Raymond J. Keating serves as economics advisor to the Small Business Survival Committee, and is the co-author of D.C. By The Numbers: A State of Failure (University Press of America, 1995)<p>

<center><h3><I>Small Business</I> Budget Watch</h3> 
<i>November 1995</i> 
<P>
<I><B>Talking Points on H.R. 2472 (Davis-Bacon Expansion)</B></I>
<hr size="3" width="45%"></center>
<UL>
<LI>H.R. 2472 expands the coverage of Davis-Bacon off-site. This
bill applies inflated Davis-Bacon wage rates to <I>&quot;laborers
and mechanics employed by the contractor or subcontractor to work
directly upon the site of the work, including work at fabrication
plants, batch plants, tool yards, rock pits, or similar facilities

... that are not located on the project site, but the principal
purpose is to provide construction materials for the project;
and laborers and mechanics employed by a contractor or subcontractor

... to transport debris, materials, supplies, and equipment to
or from the site of the work...&quot;</I> 
<P>Obviously, this will
dramatically increase the cost of federal construction as other
industries are drawn into the Davis-Bacon wage trap. This bill
also would apply Davis-Bacon to all federally-assisted construction
(presently, Davis-Bacon applies only to contracts entered into
by the federal government or through related acts). Small firms
which materially support and transport material to/from federal
projects and those who perform work on federally assisted projects
would be severely burdened by the expansion of this harmful law.
<P>
<LI>While this bill would raise the Davis-Bacon threshold to $100,000,
it fails to produce any real cost savings. Although roughly two-thirds
of the total number of federal contracts will be eliminated from
Davis-Bacon requirements, less than 4% of the dollar volume of
federal contracts will be eliminated, resulting in minuscule savings
for the taxpayer. The renovation and repair threshold, which would
apply to <I>&quot;repair, rehabilitation, reconstruction, or alteration,
including painting and decorating, of public buildings or public
works of the United States...&quot;</I> is set at $25,000 -- this
creates a bifurcated threshold, which will increase legal and
administrative burdens.
<P><LI>This bill would allow any &quot;laborer, mechanic, or organization&quot;
to petition the Secretary of Labor in order to determine the applicability
of Davis-Bacon. This provision would increase the likelihood of
legal squabbles. Many small firms cannot absorb such litigation
costs.
<P><LI>This &quot;reform&quot; does not even significantly reduce
the Davis-Bacon paperwork requirements imposed on contractors.
</UL>

<P>
This bill is not reform, it's a ploy to increase the applicability
of the Davis-Bacon Act. Actually, Davis-Bacon is not reformable
-- it has no place in American government. This law, which has
cost taxpayers billions of dollars and denied opportunity to small
firms and minority workers, can prove useful only if eliminated.
Reports of fraud indicate that as long as Davis-Bacon exists,
it will continue to impose unjust, wasteful costs on taxpayers.
Time is running out on the Davis-Bacon Act, as Congress and the
public are beginning to realize it is beyond repair.

"With high taxes and a burdensome tax system impeding the
growth and survival of small businesses, taxes will be a priority
for each and every small business person who votes on November
5," said Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC) President
Karen Kerrigan.
<P>
Kerrigan made her remarks on Capitol Hill  at a press conference
supporting the <I><B>Taxpayer Protection Pledge</B></I> -- an
effort sponsored by Americans for Tax Reform (ATR), a 60,000 member
national taxpayer organization.
<P>
"In 1992 Bill Clinton promised a middle-class tax cut, instead
middle-class small business owners got hit with the biggest tax
increase in history.  President Clinton made a campaign promise
to cut taxes, instead he raised them.  The <I><B>Pledge</B></I>
separates the true friend of the taxpayer from the big tax-and-spenders,"
said Kerrigan.
<P>
There are 2 versions of the <I>Taxpayer Protection Pledge</I>:
state and federal.  Signers of the state pledge promise to oppose
and vote against <U>any and all</U> efforts to increase taxes
while federal pledge signers promise to oppose increases in marginal
income tax rates and reductions or elimination of deductions and
credit.
<P>
 To date, GOP Presidential candidate Bob Dole, Libertarian Presidential
candidate Harry Browne, 210 U.S. House of Representatives, 35
U.S. Senators, and over 700 candidates or incumbents for state
legislators have signed the pledge.

Update on a Few Issues<BR>
</b>
</center>
<P>
First, a quick thank you for those of you who weighed in to help
us defeat the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), and the Employment
Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA).  As you know, both would have placed
new regulatory burdens on business.<BR>
<P>
<B>CWC</B> -- In the end, the Senate did not have enough votes
to pass the CWC so supporters decided to pull it from consideration
for ratification.  What this means is that our CWC victory is
temporary.  The bad news is that the CWC will probably rear its
ugly head next year.<BR>
<P>
<B>ENDA</B> -- The same can be said for ENDA.  While ENDA was
defeated in the Senate by only one vote, the legislation will
continue to come before the Congress as long as Ted Kennedy remains
a member of the United States Senate.  Stay tuned and prepared.
<BR>
<P>
<B>Immigration </B>-- Legislation to curb illegal immigration
will be voted on soon.  We remain strongly opposed to the voluntary
employee verification program due to the burden it will place
on employers and employees alike.  The &quot;voluntary&quot; system
will most definitely become mandatory in the future.  SBSC believes
that the new system is flawed in that it will be riddled with
errors thus delaying the hiring process.  Please call SBSC to
receive more information so you can contact your member of Congress
with your concerns.

the event.<BR>

</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>&quot;While we are pleased that President
Clinton signed several of the initiatives target to help small
businesses, unfortunately he vetoed or stood in the way of other
reform priorities recommended by his own White House Conference
on Small Business,&quot; added Kerrigan.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>SBSC applauded the Congress for its passage
of health insurance reforms to help small business including the
phasing-in of deductibility to 80%, and passing Medical Savings
Accounts.  In addition, regulators are now more accountable to
small businesses because Congress put teeth into Regulatory Flexibility.
 Regulators must also publish their rules and regulations in &quot;Plain
English&quot; and Congress can now conduct a final review of regulations
and vote to reject them.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>President  Clinton vetoed the following small
business initiatives:  capital gains tax reduction, estate tax
reform, legal reform, the TEAM Act and a balanced budget.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>&quot;Most importantly, the 104th Congress
began to chip away at the old status quo through its cuts in wasteful
government spending to balance the budget,&quot; said Kerrigan.</FONT>

CALL TO ACTION: Chemical Weapons Treaty Nears Scheduled Vote
</b>
<P>
 September  6, 1996<p>
 Issue No. 20<BR>
<hr>
<P>
 The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC)<BR>
</center>
<P>
The United States' Senate has scheduled a  ratification vote of
the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) before September 14, 1996.
 
<P>
Ratification of the CWC - a treaty to supposedly end the production
and stockpiling of chemical weapons - would risk the United States'
national security,  expose U.S. private industry to international
industrial espionage, and cost U.S. private firms billions in
regulatory costs associated with treaty compliance.
<P>
The treaty risks United States' national security because rogue
nations like Iraq, Syria, Libya, and North Korea have not signed
the treaty and thus are not bound by the CWC's provisions.  For
other countries such as Russia and China who are signatories,
their ratification of CWC is uncertain.
<P>
Secondly, treaty compliance would be difficult to ascertain. 
Former Central Intelligence Agency James Woolsey, stated before
the Foreign Relations Committee in June 1994 that &quot;The chemical
weapons problem is so difficult from an intelligence perspective
that I cannot state that we have high confidence in our ability
to detect noncompliance, especially on a small scale.&quot;  
<P>
<U>The CWC is a nonverifiable, nonenforceable treaty.</U>  The
United States would set a dangerous precedence ratifying the CWC
given that the treaty's provisions would strip the United States
of its ability to protect itself,  while allowing nations  hostile
to U.S. forces the ability to continue their production of chemical
weapons unabated.  
<P>
 In order to detect the production of chemical weapons, the treaty
institutes <U>a time-consuming verification program that is applicable
to a wide range of U.S. companies, that use certain chemicals
in the manufacturing process including - pharmaceutical companies,
textile mills,  paint manufacturers, food processing companies,
breweries, and distilleries.  </U>  The verification system  assigns
regulated chemicals  to &quot;schedules&quot; based upon what
is believed to be their relative usefulness for chemical weapons
production.  Each schedule has reporting requirements which include
copious amount of paperworks for each chemical and inspection
liabilities for the producing and consuming firms.  The U.S. Department
of Commerce estimates that filling out the paperwork will take
anywhere from 2.5 - 9 hours for <B>each</B> chemical depending
on its schedule classification.  
<P>
Instead of committing precious hours to operating a profitable
firm, business owners - many of whom are small business owners
- would be required to spend countless hours filling out paperwork
to prove that a chemical regulated by the treaty is used for their
legitimate business purposes.   
<P>
The CWC would be the first treaty in U.S. history to subject U.S.
industry to international authority.  
<P>
There would be 2 kinds of inspection: routine and challenge. 
Routine inspections would be directed at sites producing chemicals
that are perceived to present the greatest risk of diversion to
weapons use.  A firm could be subject to up to 20 routine inspections
per year.    Challenge inspections would be conducted when requested
and can take place within a 12 hour notification period.  There
is no limit on the number of challenge inspections a firm can
be subjected to.  
<P>
Inspectors would be permitted to interview site personnel, inspect
records, photograph on-site apparatus, take samples, record equipment
readings and use instruments to monitor processes.  <U>The company
 would be expected to comply completely with the inspectors' demands.
 The company is  also responsible for bearing the full cost of
the inspection - including  meals and lodging of the inspectors,
as part of the &quot;cost of doing business&quot; in chemicals.
 The Defense Department estimates that U.S. private industry would
pay anywhere from $10,000 to $500,000 for &quot;hosting&quot;
each inspection.  </U>
<P>
The figures given are just an estimate, but the cost to business
could be substantial given the costs associated with the loss
of confidential, proprietary information.  Furthermore, distinct
possibilities exist that due process rights could be violated
in relation to warrantless searches and personnel being compelled
to answer questions, and provide information and access.  
<P>
SBSC President Karen Kerrigan asserted, &quot;By all accounts,
the treaty is flawed, and we strongly urge the U.S. Senate to
take a sober look at the CWC.  We believe an honest assessment
of the treaty will reveal that the costs to U.S. businesses, the
loss of our economic freedom, and the compromising of rights protected
by the United States Constitution do not justify ratification
- especially since the treaty will threaten United States' national
security.&quot; 
<P>
<B>Please call or write your Senators immediately and urge them
to oppose ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention.  </B>A
sample letter follows:  <BR>
<P>
<I>Dear Senator:<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>I urge you to oppose ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention
(CWC) when it is considered by the Senate in September.</I>
<P>
<I>Chemical weapons can be inexpensively and secretly manufactured
and no treaty is going to change that fact.</I>
<P>
<I>What this treaty will do is make it significantly harder for
thousands of Americans to operate their businesses.  Small businesses
- unable to afford the thousands of dollars involved in new paperwork
- will be especially hard hit by the CWC's regulatory and administrative
requirements. The loss of trade secrets will add countless loses
to business operations.  Our economy will suffer irreparable harm.</I>
<P>
<I>Please vote to spare American businesses this unjustifiable
burden by defeating the Chemical Weapons Convention</I>.

<P>
1994 saw a record number of entrepreneurs and successful small
business people elected to Congress.  
<P>
 With 32 of 86 Congressional freshman former (or current) small
business owners heralding the economic advantages of small business
growth, the 104th Congress shifted from an anti-business to a
pro-entrepreneur agenda.   See Congress Becoming More Friendly
to Small Business.
<P>
Small-business Congress members have helped lawmakers focus on
fiscal and tax policies that aid small businesses in creating
new job opportunities for Americans.   
<P>
According to a 1995 March U.S. News &amp; World Report, there
are now 191 representatives who used to work in business-related
occupations, compared with 170 who worked in law.  
<P>
 This week <I>Small Business Hill Alert </I>highlights a speech
by small business woman, Sue Wittig, a candidate for New York's
 26th congressional district.   Ms. Wittig's speech typifies SBSC's
freemarket, limited government ideology. 
<P>
Sue Wittig's address was delivered to GOP delegates at the Republican
convention on August 12th, 1996.  <BR>
<P>
<I>My name is Sue Wittig, and I'm running for Congress.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>I'm a small business woman from Saugerties, New York.  Along
with my husband, I run a paint and wallpaper store, a family business
that was started by my Dad over thirty years ago...<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>Together with my Mom, [my Dad] built a business - and a family.
 And [he] taught me the value of both.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>We need representatives who understand the value of families...
<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>We need representatives who understand the marketplace.  It
is the small businesses of Newburgh, Kingston, Ithaca, and Owego
who are creating tomorrow's jobs.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>We need representatives who understand limited government.
 Congress was designed to be a citizen Legislature, for people
to ..., serve their community and country, and</I> <B>go back

</I>
<P>
<I>...From the small business owners...and the mothers and fathers
struggling to pay their taxes ....<BR>

<P>
The Small Business Survival (SBS) Foundation released a new <I><B>Small
Business Reg Watch</B></I>  documenting the bias of the National
Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and its interpretation of labor law.
 The report also outlines reform measures to move  labor law and
the NLRB into the 21st century.
<P>
According to the study entitled &quot;Time to Overhaul Labor Law
and the NLRB,&quot; the NLRB has taken judicial activism to the
extreme - blatant political NLRB decisions have been consistently
reversed by the courts who hear such cases.  In addition, current
NLRB Chairman William Gould has publicly stated his support or
opposition to various pieces of legislation before Congress -
an act that is unprecedented for what is supposed to be an impartial
arbritor of labor law.

</B></CENTER>
<P>
The 104th Congress has improved markedly over the previous Congress
in terms of its votes on legislation to help small business and
enhance entrepreneurship. 
<P>
 &quot;Especially during its first term, the 104th Congress was
enthusiastically pro-entrepreneur.  Tax and regulatory relief
legislation, combined with proposals to cut the size and scope
of government all comprise the small business agenda,&quot; said
SBSC President Karen Kerrigan.
<P>
Kerrigan continued, &quot;The change in Congress marked a tremendous
shift in the direction of the small business agenda on Capitol
Hill.  Rather than small business being on the defensive, we were
able to consistently support legislation being considered on the
floor of both Houses.&quot;
<P>
 However, while Congress passed an unprecedented level of legislation
supported by small businesses and entrepreneurs, these measures
were largely vetoed by President Clinton.
<P>
&quot;Unfortunately, the bulk of legislation aimed towards the
growth and survival of small business was rejected by the President,&quot;
Kerrigan noted.
<P>
At the time of the release of SBSC's <I>Ratings of the 104th Congress</I>,
Congress was preparing to send the minimum wage hike amendment
to the President's desk for approval. 
<P>
The ratings were completed prior to the wage hike vote.  Its consideration
would have proven damaging for many members ratings.
<P>

<B> The Dole Economic Plan and the Entrepreneur</b>
<p>
August 19, 1996<p>
Issue No. 18<BR>
<hr>
<P>
<B> The Dole Economic Plan and the Entrepreneur<BR>
</B>
</center>
<P>
With the announcement of the Dole economic plan, tax cuts are
back on the front burner of the nation's public policy debate.
 And though one can find all sorts of opinions on whether this
is a good or bad thing, from the perspective of small business,
entrepreneurship, and economic growth, the major proposals put
forth in the Dole plan make for sound economic policy.<BR>
<P>
<ul>
<li> <U>Cutting the capital gains tax.</U>  The Dole plan calls
for a 50 percent cut in the top capital gains tax rate on individuals
from 28 percent to 14 percent.  <BR>
</ul>
<P>
Barring a complete tax overhaul, there is no tax cut that will
do more to spur entrepreneurship, investment,economic growth,
and job creation than a sharp reduction in the capital gains tax
rate.  The great hurdle to starting up and/or expanding a business
remains access to capital.  Investing and entrepreneurship are
high&#173;risk endeavors.  High risks require the opportunity
for substantial returns.  Slash the capital gains tax in half
and you enhance the potential returns from risk&#173;taking.<BR>
<P>
A 50 percent reduction in the capital gains tax rate would provide
a major boost to small business, entrepreneurship, and the economy.
<BR>
<P>
<ul>
<li> <U>Across&#173;the&#173;board cut in personal income taxes.</U>
 A 15 percent across&#173;the&#173;board cut in personal income
tax rates works favorably for small business and the economy in
three key ways:<BR>
<ul>
<P>
1) Boosts incentives for individuals to work, save, invest, and
take risks.  Again, this is a straightforward relative price argument
&#173;&#173;as the old saying goes, the less you tax something,
the more of it you get.<BR>
<P>
2) Resources are shifted from the unproductive sphere of government
to the productive private sector.  Or another way to put it, individuals
operating in the private marketplace spend and invest their money
far more efficiently and wisely than do government bureaucrats.
<BR>
<P>
3) Since about 79 percent of all business tax returns are either
sole proprietorships or partnerships (the other 21 percent being
corporations), then an across&#173;the&#173;board personal income
tax cut directly impacts the bottom line of millions of U.S. businesses.
 Lower taxes mean more funds available for capital investment,
additional employees, et al. <BR>
</ul>
<P>
<li> <U>Additional measures.</U>  The Dole plan calls for other
tax cuts and reforms impacting small businesses and entrepreneurs,
including: <BR>
<ul>
<P>
&#173;<I>Unrestricted tax&#173;free medical savings accounts (MSAs)
and 100 percent deductibility for health insurance for the self&#173;employed.</I>
 MSAs inject choice and accountability into the health&#173;care
system, and 100 percent deductibility places all businesses on
an equal plain in terms of the tax treatment of health care expenses.
<BR>
<P>
&#173;<I>Estate tax reductions</I>.  The estate tax amount to
nothing more than a government hostile takeover of family businesses.
 All cuts in the estate tax are welcome, hopefully on the path
to complete repeal of the estate tax.<BR>
<P>
&#173;<I>Repeal of the 1993 tax increase on Social Security beneficiaries.</I>
 Again, this will boost incentives to work and keep resources
in the private sector.<BR>
<P>
&#173;<I>Expanded IRAs and institution of spousal IRAs</I>.  Such
measures will boost incentives to save and expand loanable funds
available to business.<BR>
<P>
&#173;<I>Regulatory reform.</I>  Requiring peer&#173;reviewed,
science&#173;based risk assessment and cost benefit analysis for
new regulations, regulatory review of all new regulations every
four years, and a task force to review and recommend sunsetting
ineffective and costly regulations, all point toward gaining some
much&#173;needed control over a federal regulatory apparatus strangling
businesses, investment, and entrepreneurship.<BR>
<P>
&#173;<I>Legal reform.</I>  Measures such as limiting punitive
damages in most cases, abolishing joint and several liability
for non&#173;economic damages in civil cases, and curbing contingency
fee abuses, all amount to a good start at alleviating many of
the burdensome costs of our legal system that damage or destroy
countless businesses and the jobs they create.<BR>
</ul>
</ul>
<P>
U.S. businesses and entrepreneurs need tax cuts, regulatory relief,
and legal reform.  The cost of government is massive, inhibiting
new business formation, economic growth, and job creation.  Once
fully implemented, the proposals in the Dole economic plan would:
<BR>
<P>
<ul>
<li> Increase incentives for working, saving, investing, and
entrepreneurship.<BR>
<P>
<li> Boost rates of economic growth and job creation.<BR>
<P>
<li> Help both equity and bond markets, as incentives for investment
are enhanced and faster economic growth eases inflation threats
(assuming sound monetary policy).  After all, inflation results
from too much money chasing too few goods &#173;&#173;faster growth
means more goods and services.<BR>
</ul>
<P>
<B>The bottom line is: Tax cuts help small businesses and entrepreneurs.
<BR>

</B></CENTER>
<P>
Conference attendees will convene from November 10 - 12, 1996.
 The summit -  focusing on the outcome of the Presidential election
on the small business agenda - will feature prominent members
of Congress, media, and public policy institutions.  For hotel

<i><center> Call to Action : Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC),  Institute for Justice Study Participation</i></center>

<hr>
 <center><h2>Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC)</center></h2><p>

<u><b>On or before, September 14</u></b>, the Senate will consider ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), a treaty that is supposed to ban the stockpiling and production of chemical weapons.   <p>
Grave  concerns about  the treaty's effectiveness, and its cost  to  national security and business have been raised by defense and policy experts.  <p>
<b>One of the biggest concerns regarding ratification of the CWC is the threat to national security.</b>  Few countries possessing chemical weapons are likely to cease buildup of their chemical weapons program because of the treaty.  In fact, six of fourteen countries suspected by the U.S. of possessing chemical weapons have not signed the treaty.  <p>
Rogue nations like Libya, North Korea, Iraq, and Syria continue production of chemical weapons unabated while China and Russia  - countries with the largest chemical weapons arsenal in the world - provide inconsistent and contradictory data on their chemical weapons program.  <p>
CWC poses a threat to national security because noncompliance can not be easily detected.  Since the CWC allows ample time for inspected facilities to conceal their activities,  noncompliance  would be impossible to detect.   Former Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), James Woolsey, testified that the CIA lacks high confidence in our ability to detect noncompliance, especially on a small scale.  Noncompliance is therefore unverifiable.  <p>
Signing and ratifying a treaty which is unverifiable sets a dangerous precedent for future arms control agreements and threatens the United States national security.  <p>
<u><b>Another major concern regarding CWC ratification is the direct and indirect cost to U.S. industry.</u></b>   Under the treaty, U.S. private industry would be subject to foreign inspection, thus exposing American businesses to the real threat of international industrial espionage.  Long-held trade secrets and other proprietary information could be compromised in a matter of seconds.  International inspectors  located in the Hague, Netherlands would be responsible for carrying out inspections of U.S. companies.<p>
In addition, American firms - such as distilleries,  breweries, and insecticide, pharmaceutical, ceramic, nylon, paint, textile, soap, detergent, and electronic manufacturers  -  which produce or use a scheduled chemical  would be required to fill out additional paperwork under a new four-tiered process.  (The additional regulatory burden is estimated to take administrators 9 hours for every Schedule 1 chemical, 7.2 hours for every Schedule 2 chemical, 5.3 hours for each Organic Chemical and 2.5 hours for every Schedule 3 chemicals.) <p>
It is estimated that roughly 8,000 businesses currently do not have compliance mechanisms in place.  These businesses and smaller businesses will be hardest hit by the increased regulatory burdens treaty ratification will bring.  (Past studies have shown that the per employee cost of federal regulations is 50% higher for firms with fewer than 500 employees.)  Right now it is estimated that the cost of hosting an inspection is $10,000.  If the inspection is challenged, the cost could be $200,000 - $500,000.   
The CWC is riddled with problems that should concern all Americans.  It will be voted on by mid-September.  Please call or write your United States Senators immediately and tell them not to ratify the CWC in its current form. A sample letter follows:<p>

<i>The Honorable ______<br>
United States Senate<br>
Washington, D.C.  20510<p>

Dear Senator _______:<p>

I am writing to express my serious concerns with the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).  The CWC, in its current form, will seriously damage United States national security and impose a massive, new regulatory burden upon thousands of U.S. businesses.<p>
The CWC will do nothing to reduce the chemical weapon arsenals of terrorist countries and other nations hostile to the United States.  In fact several countries of most concern to the United States have not signed or ratified the treaty.  <p>
I am also concerned with the treaty because it  is unverifiable. Former Central Intelligence Agency Director, James Woolsey, testified that noncompliance of the treaty will be virtually impossible to detect.  
And finally, ratification of the treaty will create another bureaucracy costing U.S. taxpayers millions of dollars and imposing costly regulatory burdens on thousands of U.S. companies.<p>
I urge you to preserve our national security and protect U.S. businesses by voting against ratification of the CWC.<p>

For more information on the CWC, please call SBSC at 800-223-7526.<p>

<b>Davis Bacon Update<p></b>

Recently, the Coalition to Repeal Davis-
Bacon met privately with Oklahoma 
Department of Labor Commissioner, Brenda 
Renau.  At issue were cases of fraud and 
abuse that she and her team of investigators 
have discovered.  Because of the U.S. 
Department of Labor's unwillingness to 
cooperate in reform, it is likely that more 
cases of abuse are entrenched throughout the 
U.S.  The Congressional Budget Office 
estimates that $7.3 billion in government 
funds could be save in just five years 
without the act which establishes "prevailing 
wages"that employers must pay, usually at 
much higher-than-market prices.  Call 
Representative William F. Clinger, Jr., chair 
     of the House Oversight Committee at     
202-225-5074 to voice your concern.<p>

<b>Starting Wage Hike<p></b>

As you now, both the House and Senate 
recently voted to mandate an increase in the 
starting wage by $.90.  The Senate measure 
is strikingly similar to its House counterpart 
but includes a number of tax breaks for 
small businesses, among them: an increase 
in the spending limit of small businesses 
under Section 179 from $17,500 to $25,000; 
a simplified pension plan for small business 
employers; and deductible contributions to 
individual retirement accounts by non-
working spouses.  Since the bill is not in its 
final stage however, Sen Kennedy and 
others anti-business congressmen are still 
threats.  An amendment offered by Sen. 
Kennedy that would have shortened the 
duration of the subminimum wage ($4.25) 
from 90 days to 30 days failed.  Call your 
Senator or Representative to express your 
strong desire that the small business tax 
credits stay in the bill despite any last 
minute deals by Sen. Kennedy and the like.  
We must remain vigilant if we are to prevail. <p>

<b><a href="http://politicsusa.com/cvc">CAFE Standards</a></b><p>

The CAFE standards will prove to be a hot topic 
on the Hill later this summer.  If President 
Clinton has his way and the standards are 
increased, small business owners could see a 
dramatic increase in the cost of doing business.  
Please write or call President Clinton to express 
your support for the current CAFE standards.  
The following is a sample letter to serve you as 
a guide.<p>

Sample Letter to the White House<br>
Small Business Owner<p>
Sample #1<p>

President William J. Clinton<br>
The White House<br>
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW<br>
Washington, D.C.  20500<p>

Dear President Clinton:<p>

In the last election, voters sent a message to 
Washington:  "Cut excessive Government 
regulation."  As a small business owner, I can 
tell you how important that is.<p>

Several recent news articles blamed the owners 
of light trucks for recent gas price increases.  
They also suggested the answer was increased 
governmental regulation of motor vehicle fuel 
economy.  I disagree.<p>

Higher gas mileage standards would hurt small 
business owners in two ways.  First, the price of 
the larger pickups and vans like we use would 
probably go up to encourage sales of smaller 
vehicles.  Or the manufacturers would have to 
reduce the size and weight of those vehicles-- 
which means I'd have to buy an even bigger, 
more expensive vehicle than I need to support 
my business.<p>

President Clinton, don't let that happen.  We 
need less regulation, not more.  Say that you 
will leave vehicle fuel economy standards right 
where they are.<p>

Sincerely,<p>
<p><br>

Marking the start of National Small Business Week, the Small Business
Survival Foundation formally released a report that provides a
measure of government-related costs affecting the business decisions
of investors, entrepreneurs, and businesses across the United

<P>
 All businesses <FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">,</FONT> including
small businesses <FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">,</FONT> face additional
regulations through the proposed adoption of the employment verification
measure.  It passed in both the House and Senate versions of the
immigration proposals. San Diego employers currently using a toll-free
verification system similar to House measure report that the system
can take up to &quot;three calls, several minutes, and sometimes
several days to verify a Social Security number...&quot;  At this
point, the verification system will be voluntary, but SBSC believes
it will eventually become mandatory.
<P>
SBSC's position:  The verification system does not recognize the
administrative and regulatory burdens associated with operating
a business.  Illegal immigrants who show remarkable deftness at
skirting U.S. laws will continue to do so even under the system.
 Hence, the law-abiding employer using the proposed system (and
American citizens) will be the only persons &quot;caught&quot;
by this intrusive system.
<P>
       <B> Time still exists to make your voices heard</B>.  Call
your Representatives and Senators, tell them to say no to additional
regulations  -- &quot;voluntary&quot; or not.<BR>
<P>
<CENTER><B>Starting Wage Proposal in the Senate <BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
The Senate will soon offer their version of the starting wage
bill.  It is expected to closely parallel the House proposal and
increase the starting wage by $0.90 by 1997.  The following provisions
have been added: (1) tipped employees would have the federal cash
wage frozen at $2.13 per hour, instead of 50 percent of the current
federal starting wage and (2) new hires would be paid an &quot;opportunity
wage&quot; during their first 90 calendar days of employment.
 
<P>
It is probable that Senator Kennedy will offer an amendment to
strip these provisions - thereby attempting to force a straight
starting wage bill with the $0.90 increase.  
<P>
<B>Small business owners still have time to weigh-in with the
Senators.   </B>Let them know that you oppose any increase in
the starting wage, but if an increase is unavoidable, then include
the small-business provisions passed by the House.  <U>Most importantly,
tell your Senators not to support any amendment that strips the
tip credit or the opportunity wage language.<BR>

<HR>
<P>
<b>Backed Into a Corner?</b>
<P>
If the budget negotiations were to be decided by who has 
compromised more, the Republicans would be victorious.  
The GOP Congress has compromised $68.5 billion more 
than President Clinton since the beginning of budget talks, 
as the chart below outlines.  (Budget figures are the most 
recent offers of 1/9/96 in billions of dollars.)
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<PRE>
	GOP Compromise		Clinton Compromise

Medicare	+ $58		- $27

Medicaid	+ $48		- $22

Welfare		+$3.5		- $3

EITC		+ $12		- $3

Tax Cuts	- $51		+ $20

Discretionary	+ $60		- $89
---------------------------------------------------<P>
$232.5 toward the Pres.		$164 toward Congress
</pre>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
The Republicans have compromised more than the  
President in every disputed area with the exception of 
discretionary spending.  The President's latest tax cut 
proposal, which does not provide for a cut in capital gains 
taxes, shows that he has moved less than half than the GOP 
in the area of tax reduction.
<P>
Recent reports suggest that a capital gains tax cut is likely to 
be included in a budget deal.  The Clinton Administration 
may formally propose a 7.5% cut in the cap gains rate for 
individuals with a 17.5% cut for Americans in the lowest tax 
bracket.  Separately, Congressional Democrats have 
continued to rail against a cap gains tax cut, and Vice 
President Gore reportedly has said that opposition to cuts in 
cap gains taxes was "a theological issue" for Democrats.
<P>
Language within the first continuing resolution (CR) to fund 
parts of the government allowed for "protecting our 
priorities" -- which may well mean increased spending 
levels for those politically sensitive areas the President does 
not want to cut.  That vague language has come back to 
haunt the GOP and other proponents of meaningful spending 
and tax reduction.  And, it appears that the compromises by 
the GOP have gone unnoticed.  Republican leaders have 
suspended the budget negotiations, denying them airtime to 
advance their position on the negotiations.  Pres. Clinton 
will use the State of the Union address on January 23 to try 
to bolster his.  Republicans may attempt to move forward by 
enlisting the help of conservative and moderate Democrats, 
though some GOP leaders (including Newt Gingrich) doubt 
that a budget agreement can be reached this year.
<P>
<b>Kemp Commission Points the Way to Tax Reform</b>
<P>
Citing the current tax code's "oppressiveness," "complexity," 
and "intrusiveness," the National Commission on Economic 
Growth and Tax Reform - chaired by former Congressman 
and HUD Secretary Jack Kemp - recommended scrapping 
the entire code.  The Commission advocated a new 
beginning for the American tax code, and laid out a set of 
principles to advance strong economic growth, small 
business expansion, and job creation.  House Speaker Newt 
Gingrich (R-GA) and Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole (R-
KS) voiced support for the findings of the Commission.
<P>
Despite a lack of specificity in its final report, the 
Commission has established a strong, meaningful start for 
tax reform.  The Commission called for a flat, fair tax rate 
that embraces simplicity and stability.  The 
recommendations pointed toward abolishment of capital 
gains taxes, full deductibility of the federal payroll tax, an 
end to double taxation, a two-thirds majority to raise the flat 
rate, and expensing of investment outlays.
<P>
The crux of the Commission's report is that the tax code 
should be submissive to the public, particularly small 
business owners.  An unruly IRS is no longer tolerable.  
There is little doubt that the findings of the Commission 
fulfill promises of tax system overhaul, and SBSC supports 
the general guiding principles of the Commission.  As noted 
in an SBSC press statement, however, the report: "is not 
long on details.  Now comes the heavy lifting of making 
detailed, principled tax overhaul a reality."
<P>
Although the Commission recommended including a 
generous personal exemption in tax reform proposals, critics 
attacked the report's embracing of a fair flat tax rate as a 
giveaway to the rich (surprise, surprise).
<p>
The Commission's report is expected to have an  impact on 
current tax reform proposals in Congress.  One leading 
Republican, House Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer 
(R-TX), was critical of the Kemp Commission's findings.  
Archer supports a tax based solely on consumption and felt 
the report said nothing new.

</center>
<P><hr>
<P>
<I>The New York Times</I> has reported that budget officials expect
to strike a deal by Friday (December 22).  The budget negotiations
began late November, and since that time little progress has been
made in deciding our country's fiscal fate for the next seven
years.  Unfortunately, it has been &quot;politics-as-usual&quot;
at the negotiation table, particularly for the Clinton Administration.
 As the federal debt approaches a massive $5 trillion dollars
with annual deficits of $192 billion (and as anemic economic growth
continues), you would think circumstances would dictate substantive
spending cuts.  Instead, secretive budget negotiations have us
asking whether Santa will bring us a seven-year balanced budget
with pro-growth tax cuts.  Bah Humbug.
<P>
<B>CBO: How Many Billions Can We Spare?</B>
<P>
Recently, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released its revised
economic projections - the result of a compromise between President
Clinton and Republican Congressional leaders.  The latest CBO
numbers paint a more positive forecast for the U.S. economy, and
the CBO projects that under the Republican plan, an additional
$135 billion in revenues will be available by 2002.  Washington
insiders rejoiced at this news.  The Administration budget negotiating
team felt that the additional $135 billion would bring Congressional
Republicans closer to the President's spending demands.  Economic
forecasts have failed to live up to expectations in the past.
 While CBO numbers are the most accurate, SBSC was disappointed
that the &quot;expected&quot; additional revenues will be sacrificed
on the negotiating table instead of applied to spending cuts --
which means tax cuts will more than likely be sacrificed as well.
<P>
The more Republicans negotiate behind closed doors with the Clinton
Administration, the more we are likely to see the President's
type of &quot;investments&quot; emerge- a code word for more spending.
 The gross federal debt is over 70% of the Gross Domestic Product
($4.96 trillion).
<P>
<B>MESSAGE TO CONGRESS: Invest in the Future By Cutting Spending
Now and Giving America $245 Billion in Tax Cuts.</B>
<P>
<B>The Minimum Wage Hike Returns</B>
<P>
President Clinton included a minimum wage hike in his recently
proposed budget.  The President proposes to raise the minimum
wage to $5.15 (a 21% increase) by July 1, 1997, with an interim
increase to $4.70 in July, 1996.  President Clinton's proposal
is driven by  politics  rather than economics.  As one of his
officials said earlier this year: &quot;There are few of us who
actually think it is good economic policy, but more than a few
think it might be good politics.&quot;
<P>
An increase to the minimum wage is definitely not 'good economic
policy.'  Numerous studies and sources, including the General
Accounting Office  and Brookings Institution, have concluded that
a 10% increase in the minimum wage results in a 1%-2% decline
in overall entry-level employment.  <I>President Clinton's proposal
is  projected to cost 400,000 jobs.</I>
<P>
Only 4.7% of the workforce earns the minimum wage.  Minimum wage
workers are four times more likely to be young, single, and inexperienced
when compared to other hourly employees.  Economists estimate
that only about 11% of minimum wage increases go to individuals
at or below the level of poverty.
<P>
The President's proposal should be treated for what it is - an
unfunded mandate for America's small business owners.  Considering
63% of minimum wage workers get a raise within twelve months (with
an average wage increase of 20%), wage rates would be better left
to small business owners - rather than the President.
<P>
<B>MESSAGE TO CONGRESS: No More Unfunded Mandates Like Minimum
Wage Hikes- Cut Regulations and Taxes For the Best Pay Increase.</B>

<B>Public Voices Support for Seven-Year, Tax-Cutting Balanced
Budget &amp; The Case for Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs)</B>
<P>
<B>Poll Indicates Voter Support for a Seven-Year Balanced Budget
with Tax Relief</B></center>
<P><hr>
<P>
After hearing some of the provisions of the Republicans' seven-year
balanced budget, 57% of those polled said that they had a very
positive/somewhat positive impression of the plan, according to
a poll commissioned by The Coalition for America's Future and
Coalition for a Balanced Budget: 7,200 voters were surveyed between
Nov. 29-Dec. 2.  86% said that the Congress and President Clinton
should deal with the federal budget issue this year: 47% percent
of those surveyed support a balanced budget with spending cuts
<i>and tax relief</i> compared to 39% who support a balanced budget
without tax relief.
<P>
<B>Financial Officers, Greenspan Point to the Need for a Balanced
Budget</B>
<P>
A poll of chief financial officers by the Financial Executives
Institute (FEI) found strong support for a balanced federal budget.
 FEI stated that a balanced federal budget this year will prevent
increased interest rates, falling stock prices, reduced sales,
and higher unemployment.  77% of the financial chiefs said the
economy would take a downturn if there is a failure to reach a
budget agreement this year.
<P>
Similarly, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told Capitol
Hill that the recent fall in interest rates, which lowers mortgage
rates and boosts housing and automobile sales, was caused by the
market's anticipation of an agreement between the president and
Congress to balance the budget over a determined period of time.
<P>
<B>ACTION ITEM: Continue to Contact your Member of Congress in
Support of a Seven-Year Balanced Budget with Tax Cuts.</B>
<P>
<B>Medical Savings Accounts - Good for Small Business and Health
Care</B>
<P>
Tax-free medical savings accounts (MSAs), which have been praised
by the many businesses that have adopted them as the health care
vehicle for employees, are included in the GOP's Balanced Budget
Act.  MSAs end burdensome paperwork requirements for consumers,
doctors and insurance companies.  And MSAs are portable - each
MSA plan belongs to the employee.  The market dynamics of MSAs
inject cost-consciousness into the health care system.  Thus,
MSAs directly benefit small businesses constantly faced with spiraling
health care costs.
<P>
The congressional budget plan allows MSA tax-free savings of up
to $2,000 for an individual and $4,000 for a family.  The accumulated
interest is not taxed under the Balanced Budget Act.  There is
a 10 percent penalty for non-medical withdrawals to MSAs.  (Please
call SBSC for more information on MSAs and how they work.)
<P>
<I>Concord Management, a real estate management firm which employs
nine people, uses MSAs as a health plan.  One Concord employee,
Richard Norton, suffers from asthma.  After obtaining his MSA,
Norton shopped around for the cheapest asthma medication.  Consequently,
he now pays one-fourth the amount of the medication provided by
his employer under Blue Cross and Blue Shield coverage.  At the
end of the year, Norton received a check for $750 -- the unspent
balance in his $1,500 MSA.</I>
<P>
The GOP budget plan includes medical savings accounts.  The president's
plan, offered on Wednesday, does not.
<P>
<B>ACTION ITEM: Write or Call (202-456-1111) President Clinton
to Include MSAs in the Budget Package. (fax: 202-456-2461, e-mail:

<P>
<B>The Congress' Balanced Budget Act Addresses the Security of
Family-Owned Businesses and Spiraling Growth of Entitlement Programs</B><P>
<B>Why We Must Cut Estate Taxes</B></center>
<P><hr>
<P>
One of the biggest obstacles to the generational transfer of family-owned
businesses is the estate or inheritance tax.  Approximately 60
percent of family-owned businesses fail to make it to the second
generation, and 90 percent do not make it to the third generation.
 Are estate taxes the cause?  They are a major contributor.  Nine
out of ten successors to a family-owned business cited trouble
paying estate taxes according to a 1993 survey.  Family-owned
businesses generate about 60 percent of our GDP, and during the
1980s they were essential to the increase of more than 20 million
private sector jobs.
<P>
The Republican budget would &quot;phase-up&quot; the estate tax
exemption from $600,000 to $750,000 each year from 1996-2001.
 The Budget Act would begin factoring in inflation after 2000,
and provide for a total amount of exclusion per decedent for qualified
family-owned business interests equal to $1.75 million.  Although
the modifications stop short of a repeal of the estate tax, SBSC
was pleased to have seen the Congress take steps to turn back
the harmful effects of the inheritance tax.
<P>
It is ludicrous that government claims under the estate tax up
to 55 percent (or any percent) of an individual's assets upon
death, considering that individual had established a business,
worked hard, and paid taxes over a lifetime.  What is even more
ludicrous is the fact that this act of class envy is a big money
loser for the government!  In 1994, estate and gift taxes accounted
for a mere 1.2% of total federal receipts ($15.2 billion).  At
least 75% of that revenue is eaten up by compliance and litigation
costs of the IRS and Treasury.
<P>
A cut in the estate tax, besides being morally correct, is good
for the economy.  A 1993 study estimated that without an estate
tax by the year 2000, the GDP would be $79.2 billion higher, 228,000
more jobs would be created, and $630 billion more in savings and
capital would accumulate.
<P>
<B>MESSAGE TO CONGRESS: Don't Give in to Class Warfare Rhetoric!
 Stand by the pro-job, pro-growth Estate Tax Cuts</B>
<P>
Capitol Hill Switchboard 202-225-3121
<P>
<B>&quot;Cutting&quot; Medicare and Medicaid</B>
<P>
Unless the President and Congress tame Medicare and Medicaid spending,
the two programs will eventually consume all federal revenues
and/or collapse.  If left on present course, entitlements and
interest on the debt will devour all federal revenues by 2012.
 Medicare and Medicaid are the fastest growing entitlement programs.
<P>
The Republican plan proposes to cut the <i>growth</i> of Medicare
and Medicaid, not the actual programs.  Yet this fact has been
deafened by shear political demagoguery.  The plan would hold
the growth of Medicaid to 5.2% and the growth of Medicare to 7.2%.
 The programs would still experience a major funding increase
between now and 2002.  Medicare outlays would increase from $158
billion to $244 billion.  The chart below illustrates the growth
differences between the Republican plan and the status quo. (CBO
estimates)<HR>

<P>
If left untouched, payroll taxes would have to be hiked to 4.23%
(from 2.9%) in order to preserve Medicare over the next 25 years.
 Cuts in the growth of these two entitlement programs are necessary
if we intend to restore America's fiscal security.  Politics should
not get in the way of reforming these programs.
<P>
<B>MESSAGE TO CONGRESS: Medicare and Medicaid Spending are out
of Control - Americans Know the Difference between a Real Cut
and a Cut in the Growth - Keep Cutting!</B>

<B>Economic Growth Through Tax Cuts and a Balanced Budget are
Truly at Stake</B></center>
<P><hr>
As President Clinton and Republican congressional leaders reconcile
their budget differences, it is important to reiterate your support
to your Senators and U.S. Representatives for a seven-year balanced
budget using Congressional Budget Office (CBO) numbers.  While
the president signed an agreement saying he supports a seven-year
balanced plan, already he is backing down from his word.
<P>
<B>ISSUE #1 - A Balanced Budget</B>
<P>
A balanced budget with tax cuts means we will keep more of what
we earn and spend it the way we see fit, rather than government
bureaucrats and politicians.  Will  a balanced budget translate
to a stronger U.S. economy where everyone wins?  Numerous economic
studies say yes.
<UL>
<LI>According to the Joint Economic Committee, a balanced budget
will lead to the creation of 6.1 million more jobs in 10 years,
and will boost real per-capita income 16.1%.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>A balanced budget means lower interest rates on home mortgages,
car loans, and student loans.  This, coupled with the tax credit,
could mean a &quot;balanced-budget bonus&quot; of up to $2800
a year for a family of four.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>According to a Heritage Foundation simulation, moving to a
balanced budget between 1996 and 2002 will result in the additional
construction of 104,000 homes and additional sales of 600,000
automobiles over the next seven years. <B>The simulation showed
an additional $32.1 billion in real disposable income through
2002.</B>
</UL>

<P>

<P>
It is obvious that a balanced budget within the next seven years
will have tremendous economic benefits for our economy and American
families.  But it is important that the president stick to the
seven-year agreement and use what he said were the most truthful
figures - CBO numbers.
<P>
MESSAGE TO CONGRESS: Pass a 7 Year Balanced Budget Using CBO Numbers

<P>
<B>ISSUE #2 - Capital Gains Tax Cuts</B>
<P>
Despite class warfare rhetoric from congressional Democrats and
President Clinton, capital gains tax cuts will benefit all Americans,
not just the rich.  According to SBSC Chief Economist Ray Keating,
the Republican proposal for a 50% exclusion on capital gains income
is the most &quot;pro-growth&quot; step Congress can take this
year.  Firms will pay a top rate of 28%.
<UL>
<LI>A recent study by DRI/McGraw-Hill found that a top capital
gains tax rate of 25% coupled with indexation of cap-gains taxes
for inflation and retroactivity of the cuts to Jan. 1, 1995 would
reduce the cost of capital by 12% and increase the GDP by 1.7%
from 1996-2005.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>According to the Joint Economic Committee, 83.7% of the returns
claiming capital gains came from families with incomes less than
$100,000.  The remaining 16.3% of claims were from families with
incomes over $100,000.  The largest segment of the population
claiming cap-gains (56.9%) have incomes below $50,000 -- the so-called
&quot;rich.&quot;
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>According to Economist and SBSC Board Member Richard Rahn,
&quot;The capital gains tax is a direct levy on investment and
entrepreneurship...the lifeblood of a vibrant economy...the current,
non-indexed federal tax rate of 28 percent on cap-gains remains
a formidable obstacle to economic expansion...and small business
growth.&quot;
</UL>

<P>

<P>
President Clinton says he wants a capital gains  tax cut as long
as &quot;it creates jobs and promotes economic growth.&quot; 
The Republican proposal meets that criteria.
<P>
Please make your voice heard and support capital gains tax reduction.
<P>
MESSAGE TO CONGRESS: A Broad-Based Cut in Capital Gains Taxes Benefits All Americans, Not Just the So-Called &quot;Rich.&quot;

<P>
<B>The Reconciliation Bill -- What Does it Mean for Small Business
Owners?</B></center>
<P><hr>
<P>
The House and Senate are finishing work on an enormous budget
package which includes many provisions helpful to small business
owners.  Though the budget plan doest not reduce spending and
taxes as much as SBSC had hoped, we believe the plan is a significant
and necessary step toward fiscal security.  This seven-year balanced
budget proposal faces an imminent veto upon reaching the President's
desk.  Despite strong support for the package within both chambers
of Congress, many lawmakers are feeling the heat from the special
interests.  <B>We encourage all interested small business owners
to contact their elected officials, including President Clinton,
and voice their support for a seven-year balanced budget.</B>
 Some of the pro-small business elements of the package are outlined
below.  Your representative or Senator may be reached at 202-225-3121.
<P>
<B>Capital Gains Tax Cuts -</B> The budget bill would cut taxes
on capital gains (profits from the sale of stock, property or
other assets) $35.7 billion.
<P>
The proposed maximum capital gains tax rate is 19.8% for individuals
and 28% for corporations.  The proposal would make these cuts
retroactive to January 1, 1995.
<P>
The indexation of capital gains to inflation will take effect
in 2001.  Both individuals and corporations would have reduced
capital gains tax rates for investment in qualified small business
stock.
<P>
SBSC feels these measures are a step in the right direction as
we fight for elimination of the highly regressive tax on capital
gains.
<P>
<B>Expensing</B> - The expensing amount would be raised for small
businesses.  The amount, currently $17,500, would be increased
gradually to $25,000 by 2002.
<P>
<B>Medical Savings Accounts</B> - Medical savings accounts (MSAs)
are included in the congressional plan.  Under the plan, individuals
would be allowed to make tax-deductible contributions to an MSA.
 Earnings would be tax free and distributions would also be tax-free.
 Maximum tax-favored contributions for individuals would be $2000,
for families the maximum would be $4000.
<P>
<B>Family Tax Relief</B> - The plan grants a $500 tax credit for
children under age 18 ($125 in 1995) for families earning less
than $110,000, reduces the marriage penalty, and allows for breaks
for those who adopt children or provide custodial care for the
elderly.
<P>
<B>Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs)</B> - The plan would
expand eligibility for traditional deductible IRAs, while also
creating a new IRA in which contributions would be taxable but
earnings would be tax-free.  Also, the plan allows for penalty-free
withdrawals from deductible IRAs.
<P>
<B>Estate and Gift Taxes</B> - An estate tax relief proposal was
included in the package.  The unified credit would be phased up
to $750,000 and a portion of small business assets would be excluded
from the estate tax.
<P>
<B>Self-Employed Health Insurance Deduction</B> - The bill would
raise the health insurance deduction of America's self-employed
to 50% by 2002.
<P>
While not perfect, the congressional package of tax cuts and debt
reduction is a fine way to approach fiscal security for America's
future generations.  The Small Business Survival Committee encourages
its members to congratulate Congress on a job well done and to
urge their representatives to stand by the proposal's tax-cutting,
spending reduction measures.

<h3>Speaker Promises to Make Term Limits
the First Item of Business<br>if the
GOP Retains Control of the House
<p>
</h3></center>
<p>
<i>This is the speech given by Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich on March 29, 1995 in the closing moments of the House Term Limits debate.  In it, the Speaker promises to make the Term Limits Amendment the first item of business, H.J.Res. 1, in the new Congress if the Republicans maintain control of the House.</i>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
I listened with great fascination to the extraordinarily articulate gentleman from Massachusetts (Rep. Barney Frank-D), and I tried to remember back to the platonic concern about the ability of one to argue any side of a question with equal facility. I looked up the word `sophistry'. 
<p>
A subtle, tricky, superficially plausible but generally fallacious method of reasoning. 
<p>
And I realized that speed of language is not the same as wisdom. Let me give just a few examples. 
<p>
This amendment does not preempt the States. It sets a cap. The Supreme Court will decide what that cap means, but the cap is not in any way worded to be binding and, in fact, in no way would change any of the current relationship of the States to their ability to do what they wish to do. 
<p>
I can assure the House that if the Supreme Court rules later on this year that the Congress need act, that we will visit that question and it may well be on a legislative rather than constitutional basis which will take 218 and not 290 votes. 
<p>
Let me say second that I believe this is a historic vote. I have been frankly surprised by our friends on the left. I would have thought, having been defeated last fall for the first time in 40 years, that paying some attention to the American people would have been useful. 
<p>
But I will tell you where I think we are historically. This is not a new experience in America. In the late 19th century, a radical idea emerged, that Senators should be elected by popular vote, that State legislatures should no longer select the Senators. This was a change in the Constitution, an effort to take power away from professional politicians, the State legislature, and return it to the people. 
<p>
It took about 20 years for the idea to permeate Washington. But in that 20-year period, it became obvious and even the most entrenched old-time political machine came to realize that in fact there was no alternative. 
<p>
I think term limits is a very similar pattern to the election of U.S. Senators. When it first came up, I rejected it. I am troubled by it. I think in some ways it is anti-democratic. I think that part of the argument is fair. On the other hand, from city council to county commission, to school board, to State legislature, to governor, to the Congress, everywhere in America the people say they are sick of the professional politicians, they are tired of
those who use the taxpayers' money to stay entrenched, and they want to find a device to take power back from the professional political class. They say it in New York City, they say it in Los Angeles. They say it in Idaho, they say it in Florida. Everywhere in America. 
<p>
Now, we are being visited tonight by the fifth grade from Cliffside School in Rutherford County, North Carolina. I would bet a great deal of money that by the time they are old enough to vote, we will have passed term limits, because in the end, the will of the American people is sovereign, no matter how much sophistry, and no matter how many reservations. The fact is that if over time in State after State in county after county the American people say this is an experiment they are willing to risk, sooner or later they will get their way. 
<p>
One of our good friends the gentleman from Montana got up and said. `This is the sound of the Contract dying.' Let me tell you, my friend, tonight 85 percent or more of the Republican Party will vote with the American people for term limits. My guess is tonight 60 to 70 percent of the Democratic party will vote against the American people and against term limits. We will go to the country in 1996 with a simple pledge. It will be a new version of the contract. We are not going to have one of these between now and 1997, but a new version. It will say H.J.Res. 1, Term Limits, will be voted on as the first item in the new Congress if we are the majority. 
<p>
The Democratic Party has it in its power tonight, if half the Democrats, only half, vote with 85 percent of the Republicans, term limits will pass tonight. It will take deliberate decision of the Democratic Party to deny the American people an opportunity, and we are not even fully passing it, we just send it to the Senate, then the Senate has to send it to the States. 
<p>
We are not afraid to allow the American people to have a chance in their State legislatures to render judgment. We are not afraid to allow the Senate to look at this amendment. But I can promise you, if the Democratic Party tonight defeats term limits, the Contract may have been postponed in one of its 10 items, but it will be back and when we have picked up enough additional seats in 1996, we will pass it as H.J.Res. 1 in 1997.

<h2>Term Limits Questions and Answers</h2>
</center>
<br>
Term Limits opponents often tend to ask the same questions over and over again.  ABIC has developed this page to help set aside some of the anti-term limit myths once and for all.  Below, you'll find some of the most frequently asked questions by opponents and our responses.  If you have any questions about this issue, please feel free to e-mail us and we'll try to answer your question, too!<p>
<br>
<b><i>"With congressional term limits, wouldn't we lose all that experience?"</b></i>
<p>
First of all, what has all that experience gotten us?  A huge federal deficit.  A spiraling federal debt.  Budget bills with little pork-barrel spending items that their sponsors know wouldn't pass on their own.  And a federal bureaucracy and a set of regulations that aren't serving the people and issues they were set up to serve.
<p>
Second, sure we have lots of members who have years of experience in that office.  But how many insightful intellects and energetic hearts have we lost because the process is so closed?  Who in his or her right mind would run against a 15- or 30-year incumbent?  Is Henry Hyde really the only person from north Chicago who can serve that constituency?  Is Vic Fazio really the only person in Sacramento qualified to serve the citizens of his district in the national legislature?  And if that expericnce is so wonderful, who's to say that it can't be used in another office, perhaps the other chamber of Congress or a statewide seat or the state legislature or even in the federal executive branch?
<p>
<br>
<b><i>"We have term limits--they are called elections."</b></i>
<p>
This assumes that today's elections are 100% open and fair, giving voters true choices.  Americans inside and outside the beltway know that the current electoral process is incredibly skewed toward the incumbent.  The financial and other advantages available to incumbents grossly tip the playing field toward incumbents, making it virtually impossible to have truly competitive electoral races.  The point of term limits is to open up the process.  Term limits will create more <i>open</i> and <i>fair</i> elections. 
<p>
<br>
<b><i>"What we really need is serious campaign finance reform."</b></i>
<p>
Everyone agrees that campaign finance reform is needed.  But that alone won't do it.  And no one believes that politicians will pass a law which makes it harder for them to win their elections.
<p>
There are several problems with some of the campaign finance reform ideas:  if you set a spending limit (the idea most discussed in political circles), instead of hurting the incumbent or even leveling the playing field, this actually helps the incumbent.  A challenger has to spend more than an incumbent just to break even: the incumbent already has much more name recognition, a franking ability, and so on.  Incumbents spend years serving their constituents.  When there's a flood, the local media interviews the congressman, senator and local officials to see what they are doing to help.  And so on.  The member communicates every so often with constituents to let them know what he/she is doing.  To a certain extent, this is part of the process of governing.  But it does give the incumbent an advantage that the challenger must overcome.  And spending limits will only hurt the challenger.
<p>
There is an interesting anecdote which illustrates this: Rep. Bob Inglis (R-SC) tells the story of his first campaign for the U.S. House in 1992.  Running against an incumbent, he was faced with all sorts of problems unique to challengers.  While the incumbent was invited to factory after factory, workplace after workplace, event after event, his campaign had to bite, pinch, scream, and kick to get invited to <i>one</i> factory.  Now he's invited to factories and workplaces all the time.  When he was running as a challenger, he had to spend his nights working at his law practice to keep his billable hours up to support his family while he campaigned during the day.  Meanwhile, his incumbent opponent was given a month's <i>recess</i> to come home and campaign <i>full-time</i>.
<p>
How does campaign finance reform help any of this?  We need <i>both</i> term limits and some <i>real</i> campaign finance reform.  And we won't get the latter without first having the former.
<p>
<br>
<b><i>"The 1994 elections proved that we don't need term limits."</b></i>
<p>
In the "revolutionary" 1994 elections, 90% of those incumbents who ran won.  In 1996, the rate was 95%.  The message to incumbents is: if you run, you have better than a 9 in 10 chance of winning.  The message to potential challengers is: if you run, you have less than a 1 in 10 chance--pretty poor odds if you're thinking about running for Congress against an incumbent.  Term limits are necessary to even the playing field.
<p>
<center>* * *</center><br>
<p>
The bottom line is that term limits will open up a process which is currently closed to average American citizens.  For example, in the current 105th Congress, 70% of the women serving in the House of Representatives were elected in open seats.  And 83% of the minorities in the House were elected in open seats.  Creating more open seats creates more opportunities for <i>all</i> Americans to participate in their democratic process and makes our federal government less responsive to the needs of inside-the-Beltway special interests and more responsive to the needs of everyday Americans.

<title>ABIC - Demographic Breakdown of American Support for TL</title>

<img src="/abic/images/demograp.gif" border="0" ALT="Chart: Demographic Breakdown of American Support for Term Limits">
</center>
<p>
<br>

In the first House floor vote on term limits, 82% of the Republicans voted <i>yes</i>.  Conversely, 82% of the Democrats voted <i>no</i>.
<p>
These numbers are even more significant when viewed in light of the wishes of the American people.  In January 1996, the Tarrance Group conducted a national poll of registered voters on behalf of the Term Limits Amendment National Campaign.  According to the data, 77% of the American people favor term limits while only 17% oppose the idea.  Of those, 59% <i>strongly</i> favor term limits while only 9% strongly oppose it. (See <a href="/abic/peoplepie.html.cgi">chart</a>.)
<p>
But most importantly, when broken into demographic groups, every group supports congressional term limits, including Conservative Democrats (who support the issue by an <b>80%</b> margin) and even Moderate and Liberal Democrats (65%)!  This means that the House Democrats were not just voting against the wishes of the American people as a whole, <i>they were voting against the wishes of their own voters!</i>

<p>
There are 35 Democrats who voted "yes".<br>
There are 39 Republicans who voted "no" (or "present").<br>
<p>
All other Democrats are bad on the issue.<br>
All other Republicans are good on the issue.<br>

Source: "Corporate Welfare Reform?", Janice C. Shields and James M. Sheehan, <a href="http://www.washtimes.com">Washington Times</a>, P. A17, September 4, 1996.
<p>
<i>Excerpts from the Washington Times piece:</i>
<p>
The Federal Government's Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) "doles out corporate welfare through direct loans, loan guarantees and political risk insurance...
<p>
OPIC's welfare for multinational corporations can be very costly.  As of Sept. 30, 1995, the agency reported more than $4 billion in outstanding loan guarantees and $10 billion in outstanding insurance.  OPIC estimates that $14.6 million of its outstanding direct loans won't be repaid.  In the event that borrowers default on the direct or guaranteed loans, the ultimate risk is borne by the U.S. government (read: "taxpayers").
<p>
To balance the federal budget and downsize government, Congress claims to be scaling back wasteful spending programs and eliminating others.  No so for corporate pork, which has somehow survived the cuts and will even grow faster.  The bill to reauthorize OPIC through the year 2001 nearly doubles the ceiling on OPIC's investment insurance to $25 billion, and more than doubles OPIC's financing authority to $20 billion."

<EM>A True Life Congressional Thriller</EM>. . .</H3>
<P>
<b>Chapter 3</b>
<P>
The Metcalf Amendment Reappears...<br>
....as the Thompson Amendment!!
</center><p>
In Chapters 1 and 2, we learned that ABIC has been following the disappearance of the so-called Metcalf Amendment. In July, we pointed the finger at the 67 House members who voted against the Amendment offered by Rep. Jack Metcalf (R - WA) to stop the automatic pay increase scheduled for members of Congress.  The House adopted the amendment and under its provisions, Congress would receive no payraise this year.  (Note:  Congressional salaries in 1996 are $133,644 per year.)
<P>
We also learned that when the bill came out of the Senate committee, the Metcalf amendment had <b><i>vanished without a trace</i></b>.  No one knew how it disappeared or whodunnit! In <a href="/abic/ptf/7-29-96.html.cgi">Chapter 1</a>, ABIC pointed the finger at the prime suspects.
<P>
While no amount of detective work will reveal how the Metcalf Amendment disappeared in the Committee, <b>the day was ultimately saved by none other than...<P>
<center><h3>Senator Fred Thompson (R-TN)!</b></h3></center>

<P>
In his floor statement, Sen. Thompson said, "The amendment we offer today is based upon the simple proposition that while we are asking the American people to make these (sacrifices), we must ask the same of ourselves...  We need to lead by example by showing the American people that we in Congress are willing to make a personal contribution to the effort of balancing the budget."
<P>
In short order, the Amendment passed the full Senate with a voice vote.  So now that both the House and the Senate have passed this measure, it is now very likely that it will clear the conference committee and become law.<p>
So, this week ABIC points the finger at a group of <i><b>good</i></b> guys: the six co-sponsors of the Thompson Amendment.

<H3>U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Finally Apologizes<BR> to Elderly Maine Couple in "Takings" Case</H3> </td>
</tr>
</table>
In a classic story of unrestrained government, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (ACE) has finally apologized to an elderly Maine couple for illegally seizing their retirement "nest egg" property.  In a July letter, ACE admitted that Corps officials "were clearly guilty of innappropriate behavior in (this) case."
<P>
After 10 years of legal wrangling in which ACE claimed that the property was a protected wetland, even though it was surrounded by a road, railroad tracks and houses, the Corps finally settled a lawsuit filed by the couple, the Roberges.  Worse, during the course of the lawsuit, the Roberges' attorneys discovered a memo signed by an ACE caseworker, Jay Clement, in which he stated, <STRONG>"Roberge would be a good one to squash and (make into) an example."  </STRONG>Apparently, Mr. Clement continues to be employed by the Corps despite its July acknowledgement that the case was mishandled.

This is exactly the kind of big government arrogance that insinuates itself into 
Americans' lives every day.  As Thomas Jefferson professed: "I own that I am not a friend of
a very energetic government.  It is always oppressive."   ... How prophetic!

<P>

<h2>About Americans Back In Charge Foundation</h2>
</center>

In 1990, the voters of Colorado began a nationwide revolution with their vote in favor of
term limits for Members of Congress.  Their vote was soon joined by 25 million more votes for
term limits in 23 states around the country over the last four years.<p>

Americans Back In Charge grew out of the original Colorado citizens' group, Coloradans
Back In Charge.  Founded in 1991, ABIC has been active in the state efforts by providing
grassroots support to other state citizens' groups.  Once those state term limits laws were passed,
ABIC Foundation was an integral part of the effort to defend those initiatives in courts of law
around the country, including the U.S. Supreme Court.  ABIC's legal project, the Term Limits
Legal Institute, served as co-counsel for the State of Arkansas when the Arkansas Attorney
General defended his state's term limits law before the U.S. Supreme Court in 1994.  Further,
TLLI served as counsel for the Washington state term limits group, LIMIT, when former House
Speaker Tom Foley sued his constituents in an effort to overturn the term limits law they passed
in 1992.<p>

ABIC Foundation continues its work of compiling information and analyzing the data on
the issues of term limits, the balanced budget amendment, and other key issues.  This web site is
an effort to provide some of that information and analysis to Americans who feel that these issues
are important to the future of our republic so that they may be empowered to put Americans Back
in Charge!

<h3>Union Members Resent AFL-CIO Aid to Dems  - Frank Luntz
The Hill, May 8, 1996

</H3></CENTER>
<BR><P>

<P>
Virtually everyone inside the Capital Beltway is familiar with the much ballyhooed political campaign being waged against the Republican Congress by organized labor. In fact, Washington-based labor bosses have bragged openly of their plan to spend $35 million in a campaign to defeat targeted Republicans. They have already increased mandatory dues to foot the bill, aired some of the most negative ads in years, and organized at the grass-roots level. In fact, the only thing they have not done is to inform their rank-and-file membership and ask their approval.
<P>
So we did. On behalf of Americans for a Balanced Budget, Luntz research surveyed 1,000 union members nationwide from April 23 through the 28th. The margin for error is +/-3.1%.
<P>
What we found may not please the Washington union leadership. What is surprising is not  the rank-and-file's objection to their dues being used for political activity - they do - but the depth and breadth of that opposition.
<P>
Union members overwhelmingly prefer the leadership of their local chapters to the leadership of their national chapters. When deciding union policy and priorities, members feel better represented by local chapters by a sizable 66 percent to 21 percent margin. When asked who does a better job in terms of "candidates, politics and political issue," local leadership again beast national leadership - 44 percent to 32 percent
<P>
Furthermore, 25 percent told us they "rarely" or "never" follow the advice of their local leadership, and that reaction jumps to 33 percent for national leadership. If forced to choose, only 13 percent would support a nationally endorsed candidate, while 41 percent would be more likely to support the local candidate. That does not bode well for the unions' current political effort. In fact, opposition to the effort will undoubtedly increase the split between local and national loyalty - with local unions the benefactors.
<P>
Union members have activities other than politics in mind when asked to prioritize union efforts. Preserving jobs was by far the top choice (58 percent), followed by increasing wages (27 percent). Improving the image of unions was a distant third (8 percent), but still chosen more often than engaging in political election activities (at just 4 percent). Even when given a second choice, only 9 percent chose election activities - the lowest response of the four.
<P>
This brings us to the partisan political campaign being waged by the Washington leadership. More than half of the rank-and-file had no idea such a campaign even existed. After they were told the AFL-CIO was planning to spend $35 million in mandatory monthly dues to defeat congressional Republicans, their reaction was overwhelmingly hostile.
<P>
Overall, 15 percent of the rank-and-file "strongly support" the campaign, 16 percent "somewhat support" it, while 21 percent "somewhat oppose." The bulk of members (41 percent) are "strongly opposed."
<P>
These results don't change by gender, age, education level or income. Even a plurality of Democrats (48 percent) oppose the campaign against the Republican Congress.
<P>
The biggest surprise? Those who voted against a GOP candidate for Congress in 1994 (and should endorse this effort) are evenly split :46 percent support the union effort, 46 percent oppose it.
<P>
Perhaps more importantly, among newest union members, the political campaign is opposed by a 77 percent to 19 percent margin. For a national leadership that claims to be committed to rebuilding their image, this is a very dangerous result.
<P>
We asked members if they knew they were eligible for a refund of their due spent for political purposes. Less than one-fifth responded affirmatively.
<P>
And when union members were told they had a right to a refund of dues spent for political purposes, one 20 percent would "definitely" request their money back, and another 20 percent would be "very likely" to request a refund.
<P>
Regarding the upcoming presidential campaign, Bill Clinton holds a healthy 50 percent to 20 percent lead over Bob Dole among union members, with Ross Perot at 11 percent and the remaining 19 percent undecided. The president leads among every union demographic group.
<P>
But while rank-and-file union membership is predisposed to support Clinton and other Democratic candidates in 1996, Republicans should not give up hope.
<P>
The beliefs and priorities of union members ought not to be confused with the beliefs and priorities of union leadership. After all, on issues like welfare reform, a balanced budget amendment and tax reductions - all opposed by national labor leaders - union members agree with us (87 percent, 82 percent and 78 percent respectively).
<P>
A local campaign waged from union hall to union hall - emphasizing balanced budgets, welfare reform and family tax cuts - could deliver up to 40 percent of the union vote, enough to ensure a GOP sweep in November. From ideology to issues, the rank-and-file is still up for grabs. The fact is, the average congressional Republican has more in common with them than their own Washington leadership.<P>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact:  Robert Udowitz<br>

<p>
April 30, 1996			
</b>

<P>
More than 60%of union members oppose the AFL-CIO's negative advertising blitz against Republican House members, according to anationwide poll released today by Americans for a Balanced Budget. National AFL-CIO officials have earmarked $35 million in members' compulory dues money to defeat Congressional Republicans who support a balanced budget, tax cuts and welfare reform.
<P>
The poll, conducted by Frank Luntz and Associates between April 23-28, shows that national union officials are oput of touch with their members on union politics and priorities.
<P>
<ul>
<li> 62 percent of union members oppose the use of their dues for negative political advertising against Republicna House members.

<li> 82 percent want a constitutional amendment that requires Congress to balance the budget each year.

<li> 87 percent favor work requirements for welfare recipients and limits on the limits on the length of time they can collect welfare checks.

<li> 78 percent support tax reductions that include a $500 per child tax credit.

<li> When informed of national union officials' campaign against Republicans who support these porposals, 59 percent say they would ask for a refund of their dues.
</ul>
<P>
"Clearly Washington union officials are hopelessly out of touch with rank and file union members," said ABB president Tony Zagotta at a news conference at the National Press Club. "They are shamelessly plundering workers; compulsory dues to promote tax-and-spend policies that union members oppose.
<P>
"Union members, like their fellow Americans, overwhelmingly support a balanced budget. Fiscally responsible House members should take heart from these figures, and continue to press forward with genuine budget reform proposals. The American people are on our side."
<P>

Labor Intensive
<P>
Republican leaders are preparing an all-out attack designed to counter a $35 million campaign mounted by labor unions to help elect Democratic candidates this fall. Among the legislative plans being considered: a proposal that would require more-detailed disclosure of political lobbying and contributions by union members and a bill that would make it easier for workers to resign from a union. In addition, GOP leaders are expected to tout a new poll of 1000 union members that purportedly shows a split between the AFL-CIO's official political policies and the view of its rank-and-file over such issues as welfare reform, the minimum wage and a $500-per-child tax credit. The sponsor of the survey, a conservative organization called Americans for a Balanced Budget, also claims that about 70 percent of union members would likely ask for part of their dues back if they were aware of the difference between their view and those of the union leaders.
<P>

The Wall Street Journal, Tuesday, April 30, 1996   Page 1
<P>
Union Politics spark mixed reaction, survey shows.
<P>
With the AFL-CIO vowing to spend at least $35 million to defeat House Republicans this fall, rank and file union members have been mostly mute. But silence doesn't mean support, says Americans for a Balanced Budget, a right-leaning lobby. In fact, the group says its own poll, to be released today, shows widespread dissent.
<P>
Republican pollster Frank Luntz questioned 1000 union members last week and found that 41% "strongly oppose" the AFL-CIO's spending plan while only 14% "strongly support" it. The remaining 45% have no strong opinion. Gerald McEntee, president of the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees union and head of the AFL-CIO's political efforts, said the AFL-CIO's own surveys show overwhelming support.
<P>

The Washington Times, Wednesday, May 1, 1996 Page A18
<P>
What union members think
<P>
Perhaps more galling than the fact that the AFL-CIO has launcheda massive - and dubiously legal - political campaign to unseat freshmen House Republicans is the fact that they are wagin this campaign with the wages of their members, and without the workers' consent.
<P>
A poll conducted by Frank Luntz for Americans for a Balanced Budget, released yesterday, reveals just how far the union bosses have strayed from the priorities of the union rank and file. When union members were asked whether they supported or opposed the AFL-CIO's decision to spend $35 million in dues in an effort to defeat Republicans, 62 percent said they opposed the unions' political use of dues. Only 31 percent supported the big l;abor campaign.<P>
Union bosses like to pretend that they are "representing" workers in the political arena. But it's news to the workers. Less than half of the union members polled knew that the national labor unions were garnishing their wages to pay for a national political campaign. And only 19 percent knew that they were entitled to demand a refund on the portion of their dues apenst on politicking. Told about that right, a majority of the worker said they wanted those dollars back. As od now, the unions do not have an accounting to members for how their union dues are spent. Asked if they would support a new law to require full disclosure of where their due dollars are going, an overwhelming 84 percent of union members said yes.
<P>
The disconnect between big labor bosses and the workers becomes even more pronounced whenthe union members are asked - free of partisan labels - what they think of key proposals being advanced by the Republican Congress. Not suprisingly, workers were not too patient with those who don't work: Eightly-seven percent support welfare that requires work and I slimited of duration. They also support a balanced budget ammendment by a huge margin, with 82 percent in favor of a constitutional requirement that Washington keep its fiscal house in order. And more than three-fourths of the union workers voiced their support for tax cuts for working families.
<P>
Twice as many of the workers describe themselves as Democrats than Republicans. But the real leanings of the workers come through when asked if they are conservative, moderate or liberal: 44 percent call themselves conservative, 32 percent are moderates, and only 18 percent say liberal. Given that union bosses are lobbying for liberal policies, is it any surprise that well over half of the workers polled say that the attack on the Republican Congress is no way to spend their union dues?
<P>
What could better illustrate the Democrats' true concern for the "workers" whose interest they are always invoking? Presidentr Clinton and his compatriots are more than happy to benefit from money that has been taken from workers against their wishes. Reductions in employees take-home pay are all right, it seems, as long as the differenc ends up in Democratic campaign coffers.

<h3>BLASTS AFL-CLO CONGRESSIONAL ELECTION EFFORT<BR>
$35 MILLION TARGETED FOR 75 DISTRICTS<BR>
</H3></CENTER>
<BR><P>
<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Ben Magliano<br>
202-638-6124<br>
<p>
             February 1, 1996</B> -- The AFL-CIO is planning to punish Republican congressmen who voted in favor of a 
balanced federal budget by pouring over $35 million dollars into 75 congressional races this 
year. Their goal is to win back Democratic control of the House of Representatives.<p>

This years $35 million dollar expenditure is seven times the normal amount spent by the 
ALF-CIO during an election year and represents an average of $466,000 per race. This figure is 
substantially higher than the $322,929 expended on all 1994 congressional races, according to 
current FEC data.<p>

&quot;I am amazed at the lengths the AFL-CIO will go in order to kill the balanced budget 
initiative, &quot; says Tony Zagotta, President of Americans For a Balanced Budget. &quot;Next to Bill 
Clinton, organized labor is a balanced budget's worst enemy.&quot;<p>

Americans For a Balanced Budget recently launched a nationwide radio campaign to 
correct the lies being told by the AFL-CIO over Medicare. These ads have run in Illinois, 
Massachusetts, New Jersey, Nevada, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Washington, and 
Wyoming over the past month.<p>

&quot;The AFL-CIO launched a dishonest campaign last year against 27 Congressmen for their 
courageous votes to balance the budget,&quot; says Zagotta, &quot;It now appears that the union leadership 
is poised to take their deceitful message to an even greater audience.&quot;<p>

In addition to the millions of dollars the AFL-CIO will pour into these congressional 
races, the labor giant will also make in-kind contributions of AFL-CIO personnel and facilities. 
These in-kind donations could easily double the $35 million dollar independent media campaign.<p>

&quot;The Oregon Senate race is a good example of the in-kind support that the AFL-CIO will 
be extending to upcoming congressional races, &quot; says Zagotta. &quot;More than 25 union activists 
were sent to Oregon to work full-time for Ron Wyden - that's a force nearly as big as Gordon 
Smith's entire campaign staff! In addition, the AFL-CIO paid for over 200,000 pieces of direct 
mail and set up phone banks throughout the state.&quot;<p>

AFL-CIO Leaders met with President Clinton for nearly two hours on January 8th 
and urged him to hold fast against Republican budget demands. In particular, the union 
representatives wanted to kill Medicare reform and reject any budget proposed 
tax cuts.<p>

&quot;Actions speak louder than words, so it is readily apparent that Bill Clinton lied to the 
American people during his State of the Union Address, &quot; says Zagotta. &quot;The era of Big 
Government is alive and well and has a good friend in the White House.&quot;<p>

Americans For a Balanced Budget is one of the leading groups fighting for a balanced federal 
budget. Founded in 1990, the non-partisan grassroots organization has over 200,000 members in 
all fifty states.<p>

<p>
          February 2, 1996</B> -- Americans For a Balanced Budget has launched the fifth wave of its nationwide campaign to correct the 
distortions and lies being told about Medicare spending. The first radio spots began airing in 
Wyoming today.<p>

Washington Congresswoman has been targeted by the AFL-CIO 
and other liberal special interest groups due to her votes in favor of the balanced budget. 
Numerous television and radio advertisements funded by these groups have made the erroneous 
claim that Congresswoman Cubin voted to cut Medicare.<p>

Americans For a Balanced Budget has decided to answer this charge with the truth. The budget 
passed by congress and vetoed by President Clinton increases Medicare spending by 48%.<p>

&quot;Check with any major news organizations - The New York Times, The Washington Post, ABC 
News - Their reports all prove that the congressional plan increases Medicare spending, &quot; says 
Tony Zagotta, President of Americans For a Balanced Budget, &quot;These lies and distortions are 
designed to divert our attention away from President Clinton and his unwillingness to propose 
his own seven year balanced budget .&quot;<p>

Americans For a Balanced Budget is one of the leading groups fighting for a balanced federal 
budget. Founded in 1990, the non-partisan grassroots organization has over 200,000 members in

</center>
<P>
Americans for a Balanced Budget(ABB) was founded in 1990 by David Miner, a 	member of the North Carolina General Assembly.  With over 200,000 members in all fifty 	states, ABB is one of the leading groups fighting for a balanced federal budget.
<P>
ABB is a non-partisan, grassroots lobbying organization and registered as a 
501(c)(4) with the Internal Revenue Service.
<P>
The mission of ABB is to promote a balanced federal budget, a Balanced Budget
Amendment -- with tax limitation -- to the United States Constitution, and pro-growth
economic policies.
<P>
ABBs efforts in these areas have earned the respect of senior political leaders
like Senator Bob Dole, who recently said, "Long before it became popular, ABB was 	working hard for a balanced budget and fiscal responsibility in Washington.  And since
its founding, ABB has played a major role in exposing the dangers of the welfare state
and of big government."
<P>
The current president of ABB is Tony Zagotta.  He is the former National 		Chairman of the College Republicans, and he most recently managed a congressional
campaign in North Carolina. 
<P>
<h2>The People at ABB</h2>
<h3>Tony Zagotta</h3>
Tony Zagotta, president of Americans for a Balanced Budget, joined ABB in February of 1995. 
He has overseen the growth of the organization to over 200,000 members nationwide. He is also 
directly responsible for the success of ABB's latest radio ad campaign.<p>

In addition to his time at ABB, he is the Chairman of the International Youth Democrat Union, 
the conservative international youth organization. He was elected in 1994 to a two-year term.  
The parent organization, the International Democrat Union, was founded by Ronald Reagan and 
Margaret Thatcher in 1983. The current co-Chairman is Jack Kemp.<p>

Previously, Zagotta was the National Chairman for the College Republicans. Originally elected 
in 1989 for a two-year term, he was re-elected in 1991. With a staff of ten, he planned the largest 
College Republican event in history when over 1200 students showed up for the Centiennial 
Celebration in July of 1992. During that time he was served as the Honorary Chairman of Youth 
for Bush/Quayle `92.<p>

Zagotta has been involved in politics since his graduation from Illinois State University. He has 
had experience in all different fields, ranging from being a Political Instructor for the 
International Republican Institute, to an International Observer at the Guatemala Presidential 
Elections in 1990. He was also a field representative for Jack Kemp for President in 1988 and 
was employed as a legislative assistant in the Illinois General Assembly in 1988.<p>

Zagotta relocated to Washington, DC, from his hometown in Chicago six years ago.<p>
<h3>Emily McGee</h3>
Emily McGee has been  at Americans for a Balanced Budget since February 1995. In addition to 
her tasks as Program Director, she has recently been promoted to Director of Online Services.<p>

Before McGee joined ABB, she worked at Smith & Harroff, Inc. in Alexandria, Virginia as an 
intern during the 1994 elections. While there she focused on several different aspects of 
campaign work, most notably media buying. She also assisted on research for the corporate 
clients.<p>

While a student at Colgate University, located in Hamilton, New York, she was active in College 
Republicans at the school, state, and national levels. Not only was she the club chairman and 
state executive director, she also spent several summers in Washington, DC volunteering at the 
College Republican National Committee. During that time she helped with the College 
Republican Biennial Convention as well as the Republican National Convention.<p>

Originally from Massachusetts, McGee moved to Washington shortly after she graduated from 
college in 1994. <p>

<title>Current Program Interests</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/bradley/bg.gif">
<blockquote><blockquote>

<center>
<img src="/bradley/hdr-cpi.gif">
</center>
<P>
The Foundation's Board, on occasion, undertakes to define and redefine its current program interests. At present, the Foundation aims to encourage projects that focus on cultivating a renewed, healthier, and more vigorous sense of citizenship among the American people, and among peoples of other nations, as well.<p>

The free society so central to the convictions and success of the Bradley brothers rests upon and is intended to nurture a solid foundation of competent, self-goveming citizens, who are understood to be fully capable of and personally responsible for making the major political, economic, and moral decisions that shape their own lives, and the lives of their children. Such decisions are made on the basis of common sense, received wisdom, traditional values, and everyday moral understandings, which are in tum nurtured and passed on to future generations by healthy families, churches, neighborhoods, voluntary associabons, schools, and other valuegenerabng "mediating structures."<p>

This expansive understanding of citizenship is being 
challenged today, however, by contemporary forces and ideas that regard individuals more as passive and helpless vicbms of powerful extemal forces than as personally responsible, self-goveming citizens, and that foster a deep skepticism about citizenly values and mediating structures. Consequently, authority and accountability tend to flow away from citizens toward centralized, bureaucratic, "service-providing" institutions which claim to be peculiarly equipped to cope with those extemal forces on behalf of their "clients." This systematic disenfranchisement of the citizen, and the consequent erosion of citizenly mediating structures, pose grave threats to the free society that the Bradley brothers cherished.<p>

In light of these considerations, projects likely to be supported by the Foundation will generally share these assumptions:<p>
<ul>

<li>They will treat free men and women as genuinely self-goveming, personally responsible citizens, not as victims or clients.

<li>They will aim to restore the intellectual and cultural legitimacy of citizenly common sense, the received wisdom of experience, everyday morality, and personal character, refurbishing their roles as reliable guideposts of everyday life.

<li>They will seek to reinvigorate and reempower the traditional, local institutions -- families, schools, churches, and neighborhoods -- that provide training in and room for the exercise of genuine citizenship, that pass on everyday morality to the next generation, and that cultivate personal character.

<li>They will encourage decentralization of power and accountability away from centralized, bureaucratic, national institutions back to the states, localities, and revitalized mediating structures where citizenship is more fully realized.

</ul>
<p>

In addition to these thematic considerations, eligible projects will exhibit these  features:<p>

<ul>
<li>They may address any arena of public life -- economics, politics, culture, or civil society -- where citizenship as here understood is an important issue. It is important to note that our view of citizenship is not primarily concerned with promoting civics education, voter awareness or tum-out, or similar activities narrowly focused on voting and elections.

<li>They may address the problem of citizenship at home or abroad, where the fall of many (and the perpetuation of some) totalitarian regimes has made this issue particularly urgent.  In light of our emphasis on decentralization, and considering the Foundation's deep roots in Milwaukee and Wisconsin -- areas with proud traditions of innovation and experimentation in democratic citzenship -- community and state projects will be of particular interest to us. Such projects will aim to improve the life of the community through increasing cultural and educabonal opportunities, grass-roots economic development, and effective and humane social and health services, reflecting where possible the Foundation's focus on the resuscitation of citizenship.  

<li>Projects may be actual demonstrations of the resuscitation of citizenship in the economic, political, cultural, or social realms; policy research and writing about approaches encouraging that resuscitation; academic research and writing that explore the intellectual roots of citizenship, its decline, and prospects for revival; and popular writing and media projects that illustrate for a broader public audience the themes of citizenship.
</ul>
<p>

Much of the creative and energetic leadership essential for a renewal of citizenship will be supplied by gifted individuals, who must receive challenging and stimulating programs and instruction at all levels of their education. The Foundation supports programs that research the needs of gifted children and techniques of providing education for students with superior skills and/or intelligence. Research programs investigating how learning occurs in gifted children and demonstration programs of instruction are to be considered. 

<br>

</center>
<P>

The programs and funding decisions of The Bradley Foundation are the responsibility of the Board of Directors. At the discretion of the Board, the policies set forth herein will be modified in response to changing conditions and priorities.<p>

The guidelines established by the Board of Directors will normally preclude funding for unspecified and undetailed overhead costs. No funds will be authorized for fees payable to fund- raising counsel. In addition, grants without significant import to the Foundation's areas of interest will only under special conditions be considered for endowment or deficit financing purposes.<p>

The Foundation will:<p>
<ul>
<li>Normally award grants only to organizations and institutions exempt from federal taxation under section 501(c)(3) of the Intemal Revenue Code and publicly supported under section 509(a)(1), (2) or (3);

<li>Favor projects which are not normally financed by public tax funds;

<li>Consider requests from religious organizations and institutions only when the resulting impact of the project is not primarily denominational;

<li>Consider requests for building projects on rare occasions and, in such cases where projects are reviewed, limit grants to only a small fraction of the total project cost.
</ul>
<p>

Grantees must possess the resources to properly administer grants from the Foundabon. The Foundabon conducts an annual evaluation of grants, and grantees are asked to provide periodic reports on the progress of their work.

<P>
In 1903, Lynde and Harry Bradley established a new business in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. It took courage and confidence for them to risk resources in a new venture, based only on their judgement of what was and their vision of what could be. The Bradleys' confidence was bolstered by the knowledge that in America, not only were they free to start a business, they could also begin again if they failed. The Bradleys, however, would not fail. Their business grew to become the Allen-Bradley Company.<p>

When the Allen-Bradley Company was acquired by Rockwell Intemational Corporation in 1985, a significant portion of the proceeds was dedicated to establishing The Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation. Although it has no direct ties to the Allen-Bradley Company, the purpose of the Foundation is to commemorate Lynde and Harry Bradley by preserving and extending the principles and philosophy by which they lived and upon which they built the company.<p>

As their efforts succeeded, their business grew and eventually extended far beyond its Milwaukee headquarters. Lynde and Harry Bradley remained devoted to the city where they began their enterprise and in which they lived and worked for so many years. Their foundation will continue the Bradleys' interest in helping to improve the quality of life in the Milwaukee metropolitan area.<p>

The Bradleys lived and worked according to several philosophical principles. They :believed that, over time, the consequences of ideas were more decisive than the force of political or economic movements. They recognized the interdependence of human endeavors --  cultural, educational, philosophical, economic -- and they rejected exclusionary emphasis on any single element. The brothers had an abiding belief in the dignity and decency of each person. They felt that only in an environment of political and economic freedom could individuals develop their talents, hone their skills and intellects, and contribute to the improvement of the human condition. The success of the Allen-Bradley Company stands in eloquent testimony to the enduring quality of these principles.<p>

The Bradley brothers were committed to preserving and defending the tradition of free representative govemment and private enterprise which has enabled the American nation and, in a larger sense, the entire Westem world to flourish intellectually and economically. The Bradleys believed that the good society is a free society. The Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation is likewise devoted to strengthening American democratic capitalism and the institutions, principles and values which sustain and nurture it. Its programs support limited, competent govemment; a dynamic marketplace for economic, intellectual, and cultural activity; and a vigorous defense at home and abroad of American ideas and institutions. In addition, recognizing that responsible self- government depends on enlightened citizens and informed public opinion, the Foundation supports scholarly studies and academic achievement.

<h3>Milwaukee's Bradley Legacy<br>
Continues as Foundation<br>
Moves to Historic "Lion House"<br>
</h3>
<img src="/bradley/lionhouse.gif">
</center>
<P>
In Milwaukee's sesquicentennial year, the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation has taken stewardship for one of the community's architectural treasures, relocating it headquarters to the landmark "Lion House" in the First Ward Triangle Historic District. Noted as the city's "finest surviving pre-Civil War home" and named for the carved lions crouched upon its portico, the Lion House represents the aspirations of Milwaukee's immigrant settlers and the community's heritage of civic participation.<P>

Built in 1855 as the vision of German immigrant Edward Diederichs, the Lion House has been the home of many prominent citizens, including entrepreneur Henry Mann in the 1860's banker and civic leader John Johnston in the 1890's, and, in the 1940's, president of Marine National Exchange Bank, Eliot Fitch, who was also an active leader in many local civic institutions. Architecturally restored and converted to commercial office space by James A. and James D. Hummert in the 1980's, the building was chosen last year by the Foundation's Board of Directors as a headquarters that will mark the continuing and active presence of the legacy of Lynde and Harry Bradley in the Milwaukee community.<P>

Combining the institution's office needs with a project of historical restoration is particularly apt at the time of Milwaukee's 150th anniversary, said Foundation President Michael S. Joyce, noting that "our Board is very intentionally sending the message that the Bradley Foundation is at once rooted in Milwaukee's heritage and looking to its future." The move, Joyce added, "ensures the preservation and stewardship of one of our city's most charming landmarks and provides efficient office space in a convenient location for the Foundation's philanthropic operations."<p>

The Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation, established in 1985, is a private, independent grantmaking organization directed to supporting research and education. Due to its modest size and near-downtown location, the Lion House will be a suitable headquarters for the Milwaukee-based institution's small staff. Extensive renovations consistent with the building's architectural integrity were planned by Uihlein Architects and executed by D.G. Beyer, Inc. to coordinate operational and historic objective.

the Legal Services Corporation (1989-91) and the Utah 
Attorney General from 1981 to 1989.</I></CENTER>

<P>The Legal Services Corporation (LSC), a federally 
funded agency designed to support legal services 
organizations that serve the poor, has been the focus of 
controversy almost without interruption since its creation in 1974. 
 Conservative critics charge that LSC funds are 
improperly used to challenge electoral redistricting plans, 
represent illegal aliens and drug dealers, and bring class 
action lawsuits against laws made by elected officials.  
Liberal supporters counter that LSC-funded organizations 
spend most of their resources representing the poor and 
disadvantaged in routine legal cases such as landlord-tenant 
disputes.
<P>Until recently, however, few have questioned 
whether federal dollars are needed at all to provide legal 
assistance to the poor.  Whatever may have once been the case, 
are adequate private and non-federal resources available 
today to meet the legal needs of the poor?
<P><I><B>Unknown to many, legal services providers 
receiving LSC funds also take in at least $324 million from 
private and other public sourcesan amount in excess of 
the LSC's current federal appropriation of $283 million. 
 Moreover, there are an additional 1,350 providers 
of legal services to the needy who receive no 
government funding and whose budgets total over $200 million. 
 Finally, some 400,000 to 600,000 lawyers perform 
an estimated 24,000,000 hours of pro bono work 
annually valued at $3.3 billion.</B></I>

<B>The House of Representative's Aborted Plan</B>

<P>In 1995, the House of Representatives developed a 
three-step budget resolution to phase out the LSC's funding 
by October 1997.  Both the House and Senate took the 
first step last year by reducing LSC funding from $400 
million to $283 million.  The second step called for a 
further reduction of funding to $141 million for fiscal year 
1997, followed by an end to all federal support.
<P>The House Appropriations Committee voted earlier 
this year to take the second step.  But when the 
appropriations bill reached the House floor on July 23rd, 56 
Republicans voted with all but three Democrats to fund the LSC at 
$250 million.  Lobbyists for increased funding, led by the 
Americ Bar Association, had predicted a close vote and 
were elated by the comfortable margin of victory.  Their 
success was complete when the final fiscal budget figure came in 
at $283 million -- the same amount the LSC received in 
fiscal year 1996.  The House three-step plan, in other 
words, appears to have been aborted after achieving only 
one-third of its planned savings in federal expenditures.
<P>House reformers planned to phase out LSC funding 
in order to give LSC-supported legal services 
organizations sufficient time to acquire replacement funds.  Many of 
these organizations originally received all their funding from 
the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO), a War on 
Poverty agency created in the mid-1960s.  However, other 
LSC-funded legal services providers that predate the OEO 
have had substantial non-federal funding for years.
<P>Today, almost all LSC-funded organizations 
receive funding from non-federal sources.  In fact, in the 
just-ended 1996 fiscal yearthe first year of the reduction in 
the LSC's budgetnon-LSC funding of these 428 
providers surpassed LSC funding.  That the LSC is now providing 
less than half the total funding of all its granteesand only 
a third of the funding of all providerswas never 
discussed in the lengthy debate preceding the recent House vote.  
Nor was there any mention that some 1,350 legal service 
providers receive no money from the LSC yet have 
budgets totalling over two hundred million dollars.  Although 
the House debate did address the question of whether pro 
bono lawyers who volunteer their services for the needy 
could &quot;fill the gap&quot; created by further cuts in the LSC's budget, 
no mention was made of how much non-LSC money the 
nation's legal services providers have at their disposal.
<P>

<a name="2">
<B>States Move to Fill the Gap</B>
<P>Less than a month before the House vote, the state of 
New Jersey, using court filing fee revenue, increased funding 
to its network of 15 legal services providers by an 
estimated $8.2 million.  The state legislature acted on the belief 
that LSC funding, already reduced, would probably be 
cut again, and might ultimately disappear.  New Jersey's 
legal services providers now have a total budget of $25.5 
million28 percent more than last yeardespite a $2.2 
million reduction in LSC monies.
<P>New Jersey is not the only state that has recently 
increased its budget for legal services.  Pennsylvania, only 
six days before the House vote, cleared the way for an 
estimated $6-million annual infusion of new money for its 
19 LSC-funded and 22 non-LSC-funded providers.  
The legislature's decision was based on the same 
argument made in the New Jersey legislaturethat LSC 
funding would likely be cut this year and eliminated next year.  
In fact, as <a href="#Table I">Table I</a> shows, at least six states have found 
their legal service resources greater this year due to new 
money from private and other public sources.
<P>The chief source of this money is state funding in 
the form of first-time or increased filing fee revenue and 
general operations revenue.  States that began funding 
civil legal services for the first time in 1995 include 
Kentucky, Missouri, and Rhode Island.  Still other states, 
including California, Connecticut, Florida, Massachusetts, 
Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Tennessee, raised their level 
of support.  All told, an unprecedented surge of over 
$35 million in new state money was added to legal 
services budgets in the last year and a half in 17 states, 
including those in <a href="#Table I">Table I</a>.
<P>

<a name="3">
<B>A Conspiracy of Silence</B>
<P>Many LSC recipients and supporters know that the 
amount of non-LSC funding available to legal services providers 
is far more than anyone has ever communicated to 
Congress, but they have kept this fact well guarded.  For instance, 
all but one of New Jersey's thirteen members in the House 
of Representatives, including eight Republicans, recently 
voted to increase LSC funding.  None of them informed 
their colleagues during the July 23rd floor debate that 
New Jersey recently provided $8.2 million in new state 
money for legal services.  Likewise, Republican 
Representative Jon Fox of Pennsylvania, co-sponsor of the measure 
to increase LSC funding, was silent about 
Pennsylvania's allocation of an additional $6 million for legal services.
<P>This pattern of seeking federal funds for legal 
services with prior knowledge that one's own state is already 
providing state funds seems to be common.  Retiring 
LSC president Alexander Forger acknowledged the practice 
in an unguarded statement before the LSC Board in 1994. 
 While Forger was president of the New York State 
Bar, New York adopted IOLA. (Most other states use the term &quot;IOLTA,&quot; 
or Interest on Lawyers' Trust Accounts.)  
Under this program, most states require lawyers to turn 
over interest generated by their clients' trust funds to a fund 
used mostly to finance legal services programs.  Forger 
advised his colleagues, &quot;I would put in a footnote, for 
budgetary purposes in congressional presentations, that New 
York State... last year, in recognition of the decrease in 
IOLA funds at the state level and at the city level, 
appropriated unrestricted funds for legal services to poor people. . . .  
I trust Congress won't inquire as to whether local 
jurisdictions are undertaking some of that responsibility.&quot;  
The state funding referred to was $3 million, and it 
continued for at least three years.<B><I>1</I></B>
<P>Forger, no doubt, would excuse his failure to 
volunteer this information by arguing that this amount, even 
when supplemented by LSC funding, was inadequate to serve 
the legal needs of the poor.  But the flaw in this reasoning 
was identified by the executive director of Chicago 
Volunteer Legal Services, a non-LSC-funded legal services 
provider that relies on hundreds of pro bono lawyers.  In a 
public debate last year over whether filing fees should be 
increased to generate more revenue for legal services in 
Cook County (Chicago), M. Lee Witte remarked, &quot;what 
legal service providers want . . . is 
infinite.&quot;<B><I>2</I></B>
<P>

<a name="4">
<B>The LSC's Questionable Data</B>
<P>There is a wide disparity between the actual amount 
of funding for legal services for the needy and the figure 
the LSC has presented to Congress for the last ten years.  
This discrepancy exists because the LSC only disseminates 
information about providers who receive direct grants 
from the LSC.
<P>There are good reasons to question the LSC's figures. 
 First, the LSC compiles the amounts of non-LSC 
funding from paperwork submitted by providers when they 
apply for LSC grants.  These amounts are not audited.  
Furthermore, the amounts sometimes differ significantly 
from figures in other published sources.
<P>For instance, in 1995 the Legal Aid Society (LAS) of 
San Diego, an LSC-funded provider, reported to IOLTA 
administrators of the California State Bar that its non-LSC 
funding in 1994 was approximately $1.6 million.  LSC 
records, however, showed its 1994 non-LSC funding to be less 
than $1.1 million.  This half million dollar difference could 
be due to the LSC's failure to include the provider's 
so-called &quot;derivative income,&quot; such as attorney fee awards, 
publication and investment income, and unexpended or 
carry-over funds.  Until the early 1990s, such derivative income 
was always included in LSC figures presented to Congress. 
 This generally amounted to 15.2 percent of providers' 
non-LSC funding and 4.9 percent of their LSC grants.  For 
some individual providers, the amount was much higher.  But 
the $500,000 difference could also be due to the 
provider giving one figure to the LSC and another to the 
California State Bar.
<P>In any case, the LSC should inform Congress how 
much derivative income all LSC-funded providers have reported. 
 Providers are still required to submit this information to 
the LSC.
<P>

<a name="5">
<B>Subgrantees' Non-LSC Funding</B>
<P>The LSC has also failed to provide Congress with 
adequate information on the many LSC subgrantees.  
These are providers who receive money indirectly from the 
LSC in the form of subgrants made by LSC-funded providers.
<P>No one knows the exact number of subgrantees.  In 
1995, the LSC compiled a list of subgrantees that was intended 
to be official.  It listed 98 subgrantees, some of whom 
received more than one LSC subgrant.  Since the list was 
released, however, research has identified another 12 to 14 
providers that claim to have received LSC funding in 1995, in 
some cases as subgrantees.  For instance, the LSC's list 
includes only ten California subgrantees.  However, 
Congressman Julian Dixon of California referred to 14 
California subgrantees as of 1995 during the recent House 
debate.<B><I>3</I></B>
<P>While the LSC has provided Congress with 
information on the non-LSC funding of its direct grantees, it has 
not offered amounts of non-LSC funding for its 
subgrantees, which in 1995 numbered at least 112.  <a href="#Table II">Table II</a> shows 
the total budgets of eight subgrantees in 1995.  (These eight 
had the largest budgets of 18 subgrantees for which total 
budget funding information was available.)  Total 1995 non-LSC 
funding for these eight subgrantees was nearly $29 million.  
Another $8 million in non-LSC funding derives from 
the combined budgets of the remaining 10 subgrantees 
and from a portion of the combined budgets of another 
27 subgrantees.  Together, these 45 subgrantees obtained 
$37 million in non-LSC funding.  This amount was not 
included in the LSC's non-LSC funding figure of $249 million 
for 1995.<B><I>4</I></B>
<P>Yet this $37 million figure is far from complete 
because it does not account for the non-LSC funding of at least 
67 remaining subgrantees for which adequate information 
is unavailable.<B><I>5</I></B>  Available data suggests that the 112 or 
more subgrantees of LSC monies spent over $75 million in 
non-LSC funds on legal services to the poor in 1995.  Added 
to the LSC's figure for 1995 of $249 million, total 
non-LSC funding for the 428 or more providers receiving 
LSC grants, directly or indirectly, probably exceeded $324 
million.
<P>

<a name="5">
<B>Total Non-LSC Funding</B>
<P>This amount does not include the more than 1,350 
legal services providers, such as Chicago Volunteer Legal 
Services, that have operated year after year without any LSC funding.  
One must take into account over 950 largely 
pro bono &quot;private bar involvement&quot; (PBI) programs which 
the ABA lists in its annual PBI directory and over 1,110 
legal services providers that received IOLTA grants during 
the last year.  After adding the 428 direct and indirect 
recipients of LSC money in 1995 and eliminating duplicates 
from these three lists, over 1,625 providers remain.  To this 
can be added a number of providers who do not appear on 
any of these lists, such as the approximately 45 chapters 
and affiliates of the American Civil Liberties Union.  All 
told, there are easily 1,800 providers of civil legal services in 
all 50 states.
<P>Although the combined funding of these providers 
has never been the subject of a comprehensive study, 
enough data exists to make a fairly reliable estimate of total 
non-LSC funding.  <a href="#Table III">Table III</a> shows the non-LSC funding of 
of all states that compiled and reported on their non-LSC funding
over a 12-month period during the last three years.  
These 13 states had combined non-LSC funding of $175 million.
<P>Extrapolating to the 50 states, total nationwide 
non-LSC funding for legal services is $463 
million.<B><I>6</I></B>  To this can be added the resources of the ACLU's network of chapters 
and affiliates -- $35 million.  This total of $498 million is 
more than double the $210 million in non-LSC funding that 
the LSC estimates its direct grantees received in 1996.
<P>Yet even this figure of $498 million is incomplete.  
It does not count, for instance, the hundreds of millions 
in public funds that each year support consumer 
protection and constituent service functions at the federal, state, 
and local levels of government.  Much of this addresses the 
civil legal problems of the poor in the same way as do pro 
bono and salaried legal services lawyers.  Nor does this 
amount include the hundreds of millions that government and 
private sources distribute each year to social services 
agencies that deal with non-legal problems often brought to 
legal services lawyers.  Considerable data show that most of 
the &quot;cases&quot; handled by LSC-funded lawyers are actually 
problems that can be addressed by non-lawyers.  To cite 
only one instance, the Legal Referral Service of the San 
Francisco Bar Association refers 75 percent of its 85,000 
yearly calls to government agencies or social 
services.<B><I>7</I></B>
<P>

<a name="6">
<B>The Future of Legal Services for the Poor</B>
<P>The impact of reduced LSC funding in 1996 
together with the potential loss of IOLTA funds resulting from 
a recent federal appeals court decision will be the 
overriding concern voiced by LSC supporters in the near future. 
 Whether further cuts are made in the LSC's budget 
will largely depend on whether Congress is convinced 
that private and other public resources can &quot;fill the gap.&quot;
<P>If LSC funding is reduced by another substantial 
amount, at least some LSC grantees may have to cease 
operations given the competitive and rapidly growing legal 
services industry.  Clearly, however, there are considerable 
private and other public resources for meeting the legal needs of 
the poor.  Alan Houseman, a key draftsman of the 1974 
LSC Act, has observed that &quot;There's an unfortunate notion 
in Legal Services that only experts like themselves can 
litigate these kinds of [class action] cases.  But there's a 
broad range of public interest programs around the country 
that don't take Federal money that can do them.  And we 
haven't really even begun to tap the private 
bar.&quot;<B><I>8</I></B>  Houseman would no doubt stress that his comments apply only 
to class actions, but they apply equally if not more so to the 
routine types of cases that Congress has said should be the 
only focus of LSC-funded providers.  Another longtime 
legal services lawyer, Mike Daniel, has remarked, &quot;I don't 
know how you can justify taking federal money to provide 
routine legal services.  There are other lawyers who will do 
those routine [cases].&quot;<B><I>9</I></B>  Indeed, not only are there other 
lawyers; there are considerable non-lawyer resources that can 
assist the needy just as effectivelyand for less 
money.<B><I>10</I></B>
<P>If the LSC were abolished, there would still be at 
least half a billion dollars available each year for legal 
services for the needy.  This does not count the far greater value 
of pro bono work on behalf of the poor.  Nor does it count 
the support of government and private consumer and 
social-service agencies whose work directly affects the poor.
<P>Is $283 million in federal legal services funding 
still necessary?  If Congress is serious about balancing 
the budget and reducing the role of the federal government, 
it might wish to revisit the LSC budget next spring.

<B>Pro Bono Legal Services for the Poor</B>
<BR>
Lawyers have a long and distinguished history of providing free or 
<I>pro bono</I> (from the Latin &quot;Pro bono publico,&quot; meaning &quot;for public good&quot;) legal services 
to the poora history that predates the nation's founding. 
 Accounts of the young lawyer Abe Lincoln 
representing poor clients for little or no compensation have 
always been part of the lore of the young Republic.  The 
history of formal pro bono legal service organizations is 
almost as long and equally distinguished.
<P>Organized delivery of free legal services began 
in 1876 with the founding in New York City of what 
became the Legal Aid Society (LAS).  Created to help 
poor German immigrants, by 1901 it was serving 16,000 
clients of all nationalities.  (Today, the LAS civil office 
has a $20-million budget, all of which comes from 
sources other than the LSC.)  Another venerable provider of legal services, the Chicago Bureau of 
Justice, was created in 1888 and was the first organization 
to provide civil legal help to the poor regardless of 
nationality or race.  By 1923, at least 33 legal aid societies 
in over 40 cities were providing basic legal services.
<P>According to the LSC, the number of private 
attorneys in the United States today who perform pro bono 
civil legal work for the poor is roughly 130,000.  This, 
however, was the figure cited by an ABA spokesman 
seven years ago when there were less than 500 organized 
pro bono programs.  Whatever the figure's accuracy then, 
it is totally unreliable today since the number of pro 
bono programs has increased to 950.  Moreover, ABA 
official Laurie Zelon recently conceded that the 130,000 
figure does not count the many lawyers who perform 
valuable pro bono service outside of organized 
legal-services programs.
<P>By conservative estimates, at least 400,000 and 
possibly as many as 600,000or between 44 and 67 
percent of all private attorneysdo pro bono work.  
These numbers are derived from surveys conducted in 
states with lawyer populations totalling half the lawyers in 
the U.S.
<P>Assuming that the remaining number of lawyers 
per forms an equal amount of pro bono work, the total number of lawyers rendering pro bono service in 
1991 was approximately 473,000.  Since the total lawyer 
population grew from 805,872 in 1991 to 896,172 in 1995, 
the number of lawyers currently providing at least some 
pro bono work is probably close to 525,000.  Thus, the 
range of 400,000 to 600,000 is realistic.  Whatever the 
exact number, it is far greater than the 130,000 
commonly cited.
<P>Information on the amount and value of pro bono 
work lawyers perform is available for six 
statesCalifornia, Florida, Maryland, New York, Oregon, and Texas.  
Together, these states contain 40 percent of all lawyers. 
 Assuming that these states and the value placed on their 
lawyers' time by their state bar leaders are representative 
of the total lawyer population, an estimated $3.3-billion worth of pro bono work is 
performed annually in the U.S.  That is over 8 times the LSC's 
1995 budget.
<P>Critics may dismiss this figure by arguing that 
most LSC-funded lawyers are full-time and compensated on 
a salary basis; their much lower hourly rate cannot 
be compared to this estimated value of pro bono hours.  
A more accurate analysis, they say, would compare 
the number of hours LSC-funded lawyers work to the 
number of pro bono hours.
<P>If we extrapolate the number of pro bono hours 
contributed in the six states surveyed (9,659,709) to 
all lawyers, this suggests that lawyers contribute 
over 24,000,000 pro bono hours per year.  In other words, 
pro bono attorneys contribute over five times the number 
of hours worked annually by the 4,749 staff attorneys of 
the approximately 281 providers in the LSC's network.

<P>
<BR>
<DD>This election year there has been much loose talk about the 
so-called religious right.  Mainstream media stories on the rise of the Christian 
Coalition speculate on its likely impact on 
national politics and generously quote those who warn that its activities will produce dire 
repercussions for the country in general and the Republican party in particular.  In all 
the clatter there is rarely any mention of the religious left.
But left-leaning churches and religious leaders have been involved in American 
politics long before there was a Christian Coalition. 
 For years the Rev. Jesse Jackson has asserted that political engagement from the pulpit is 
an essential part of the church's moral responsibility.  In 1988 Jackson's presidential 
campaign was financed in part with cash donations openly collected in black churches.  
In 1994 a group of black ministers led by Bishop L.E. Willis, Sr. endorsed Virginia 
Democratic Senator Charles Robb in his reelection 
contest against Oliver North.  Willis's group, the Third Jurisdiction of the Church of God 
in Christ, represented about 60 churches in Virginia.  Yet liberals routinely cite the 
North-Robb race as evidence of a one-sided Christian partisanship.
<P>No one seems to mind when liberal religious groups engage in political activities. 
 Left-wing church activists lobby in support of socialized medicine and racial 
preference programs, and against welfare reform.  
They organize boycotts against business and agitate for mandates and regulations in the 
name of &quot;corporate responsibility.&quot;  Liberation 
theologians make foreign policy pronouncements and lead crusades for nuclear disarmament. 
 Liberal church leaders denounce Republican policies as cruel and un-Christian.
<P>This kind of religious protest is not isolated and sporadic; it is organized.  
Religious groups on the left engage in the same 
activism  albeit on a smaller scale  as the Christian Coalition.  The Interfaith 
Alliance (TIA) is one such group that has lately 
been in the news.  Its organizers say it was 
created as an alternative to the &quot;divisiveness 
and intolerance of the extreme religious right.&quot;   
<P>The agenda of the Interfaith Alliance is far removed from that of conservative 
Christian groups  you won't hear much from them about the right to life   yet its methods 
are quite similar.  In July, it announced a 
&quot;Road to Renewal&quot; that will bring &quot;TIA's 
national religion leaders to local TIA chapters and 
the national party conventions to help empower mainstream people of faith.  TIA's 109 
chapters will distribute millions of voter guides. 
. . .&quot;  Distributing voter guides is exactly 
what the Christian Coalition does.  And it is 
exactly what has the Coalition's liberal critics 
so excited.  
<P>
Earlier this year, the Oregon Interfaith Alliance distributed its &quot;mainstream&quot; 
voter guides to Oregonians prior to that state's special U.S. Senate election.  Like the 
Christian Coalition's guides, they were supposed to provide Oregon voters with the 
candidates' &quot;positions on important issues.&quot;  
Distributed by the Alliance's network of grassroots activists, the guides covered 
such issues as the minimum wage, Medicare and Medicaid, the environment and housing 
discrimination.  What party's candidate do you suspect ranked better on the Interfaith 
Alliance scale?   
<P>Democratic Rep. Ron Wyden narrowly edged out his GOP opponent to win the 
U.S. Senate seat.  Did the Interfaith Alliance's guides play a role in Wyden's victory?  
Probably.  But does that make them illegal?   
Where is the outcry from those who groan about religious influence?  
<P>
<a name="#2"></a>
<B>Just What is the Interfaith Alliance?</B>
<P>
<DD>The Interfaith Alliance, a Washington-based 501(c)(4) organization, bills itself 
as mainstream and moderate.  Yet careful scrutiny reveals that it is anything but moderate. 
 Indeed, the Alliance clearly has a partisan purpose: to elect liberal Democrats.  
<P>It is not surprising to discover that this supposedly nonpartisan group was 
started with Democratic party money.  In 1994, the Democratic Congressional Campaign 
Committee (DCCC) provided $25,000 in seed money to the Alliance.  The DCCC is 
the sister organization of the Democratic National Committee.  It recruits, and 
raises money for, Democratic congressional candidates.  Its current chairman is Rep. 
Martin Frost (D-TX).
<P>The DCCC's support for the Interfaith Alliance may reflect the growing 
awareness on the part of many Democrats that 
modern liberalism's hostility toward religion and 
traditional morality has alienated many voters and driven them into the hands of the 
Republican party.  Fearing a religion gap, they 
fund a group, nominally oriented toward religion, that promotes a secular agenda of big 
government while attacking religious conservatives who have decided to get involved 
in public policy.  
<P>The Alliance has found a friend in organized labor, which has committed 
itself--to the tune of $35 million--to defeating Republican congressional incumbents.  
Toward that end, the AFL-CIO has sought to take advantage of the Alliance's voter guides. 
 On August 29, the <I>Washington Post</I> reported that AFL-CIO field organizers  deployed 
to &quot;targeted Republican districts&quot;  have 
a &quot;special mission&quot;:  to &quot;persuade preachers 
in North Carolina, Georgia, Iowa, Washington, Oregon and Colorado to dump the 
voter guides issued by the Christian Coalition and instead give parishioners literature 
prepared by the Interfaith Alliance.&quot;
<P>Such activities are part of a resurgent alliance between labor and left-leaning 
church groups that has emerged in the wake of leadership changes at the AFL-CIO.  In 
the past, relations between big labor and liberal religious activists were strained.  Former 
AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland, a staunch anti-communist, had little patience for the 
religious left because of its uncritical sympathy for Third World revolutionary movements. 
 The deposed Kirkland's successor, John Sweeney, has much closer ties to 
radical elements in the liberal coalition, and he 
has worked to rebuild ties between labor union leaders and religious &quot;progressives.&quot;
<P>The Alliance claims that its voter guides are &quot;fair and honest&quot; and not slanted 
toward one particular party.  But the Alliance 
frames issues so as to make the final positions 
taken by the Democratic party leadership appear more favorable.  For instance, who 
could oppose &quot;Supporting families by 
advocating for a fair living wage,&quot; or &quot;child care 
that protects and nurtures every boy and girl,&quot; 
or "child care that protects and nurtures every boy and girl," or skill
training needed for good paying jobs." As Alan Wisdom, vice president of the Institute on Religion &amp; Democracy, noted 
recently, the Alliance is obviously trying to create the impression that the 
Democratic party &quot;is the party of righteousness 
and reason.&quot; 
<P>
<a name="#2"></a>
<B>Jill Hanauer: Abortion Activist and Party Regular</B>
<P>
<DD>The Interfaith Alliance's partisan pedigree runs deep and it is most apparent in 
the group's leadership.  
<P>Alliance organizers have assembled a collection of clerics to serve as a board of 
directors.  Mostly representatives of mainline denominations, the list includes 
several prominent religious church figures such as Bishop Edmond L. Browning, primate of 
the Episcopal Church in the United States; Joan Brown Campbell, general secretary of 
the National Council of Churches; Denise Davidoff, moderator of the Unitarian 
Universalist Association; and J. Philip Wogaman, senior minister of Foundry United 
Methodist Church in Washington, D.C., the church 
regularly attended by President and Mrs. Clinton.  (See box for complete list).
<P>Their names appear prominently in press releases and statements.  However, this 
seems more style than substance--window dressing to lend the group an air of reverence 
that it would not otherwise receive.  Boards of directors are rarely involved in the day to 
day operations of nonprofit lobby groups.  They may appear at conferences or serve as 
occasional spokesman, but generally they exist to authorize the activities of the full-time staff.
<P>In this case, the staff member who calls the shots is the Alliance's executive director, 
Jill Hanauer.  Her past disproves the Alliance's claims to moderation and calls into 
question its affirmations of faith.
<P>Hanauer's background is politics, not religion.  A long-time Democratic party 
operative, she was a staffer for former Senator 
Gary Hart and later worked on Rep. Patricia Schroeder's 1988 presidential campaign. 
 According to <I>National Journal</I>, she raised more than $3 million for the Democratic 
National Committee before joining the National Abortion Rights Action League 
(NARAL) as its political action director in 1990.  In 
1992, she joined Iowa Senator Tom Harkin's presidential campaign.  All in all, these are 
hardly the sort of activities of someone in the 
mainstream.
<P>
<a name="#3"></a>
<B>Hostility Toward Religion</B>
<P>
<DD>The Interfaith Alliance presents itself as a faith-based organization, but Hanauer's 
past contains incidents of antagonism toward religion.
<P>
As a college student at the University of Colorado, she organized efforts to 
prevent the school's football coach from leading 
his team in a moment of silence before games  and she eventually got the American 
Civil Liberties Union to file suit against the school. 
<P>
The football coach, Bill McCartney, who describes himself as a &quot;born-again 
Catholic,&quot; was proscribed from asking his 
players to bow their heads in silent prayer before taking the field.  He was prevented 
from asking them to say grace before team meals.  He could not share his faith while 
speaking in his capacity as football coach to 
local community groups.  All this was the result 
of an agreement negotiated between the University and the ACLU. 
<P>
McCartney's more egregious offenses included Biblical references during practice 
 recounting the story of David and Goliath, for instance.  The 
<I>Los Angeles Times</I> reported that on one occasion when a player was seriously injured and lying in a 
coma, &quot;the team assembled after practice, 
dropped to one knee and joined hands for a moment of silence.&quot;  
<P>
Hanauer's efforts to keep prayer out of football were but one aspect of her 
campus activism.  During her time at the University 
of Colorado, she also garnered publicity for organizing anti-CIA protests. (This 
resulted in the arrest of 477 people.)  And she 
worked to make sure that abortion coverage 
remained a part of the student health insurance plan.
<P>
Hanauer's apparent antipathy toward religion  and for coach McCartney  did 
not fade after she graduated.  She has criticized Promise Keepers, the national Christian 
men's group that challenges men to be more involved with their wives, children, 
and churches.  Founded in 1990 by McCartney, the group extols personal responsibility 
and family commitment at gatherings across the country which regularly attract tens of 
thousands of participants.  But this is too much 
for Hanauer.  Quoted in the <I>Minneapolis Star 
Tribune</I> in July 1995, she accused McCartney of having &quot;a very extreme political agenda.&quot; 
<P>One telling characteristic about the Alliance is its conspicuous use of the 
word &quot;extreme.&quot;  For example:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> &quot;these extremists organizations preach . . . a destructive message of division, 
discord, and even outright hatred.&quot; 
<LI> &quot;Pat Robertson has long advocated many extremist . . . ideas.&quot;  
<LI> &quot;Help us prevent Pat Robertson's Christian Coalition, as well as other extremists 
with religious claims for an exclusive political agenda, from writing their extremist 
views into the law of the land.&quot;
</UL>
<P>The Interfaith Alliance is ever-ready to cast stones and demonize its political 
oppo--odd behavior for a group that claims to &quot;promote the positive role of religion 
in public life.&quot; and asks candidates to take a &quot;Pledge of Civility.&quot;  It defines 
as  &quot;mainstream&quot; or &quot;moderate&quot; those who 
would normally be associated with the cutting edge of liberalism, and everyone 
to the right of that (most people) must be an extremist.
<P>
<a name="#5"></a>
<B>Who are the Real Extremists?</B>
<P>
<DD>In trying to tar conservative Christians as religous extremists, the Alliance makes 
common cause with groups like Americans United for Separation of Church and State. 
<P>Americans United and the Interfaith Alliance Foundation jointly prepared a 
report that &quot;highlights the Christian Coalition's extreme agenda and its efforts to gain control of the Republican Party.&quot;
<P>The report maintains that the Christian Coalition has forced Republican politicians to embrace various &quot;extreme&quot; positions 
such as calling for the repeal of quotas, the adoption of English as the official language, 
and the elimination of the Department of Education and the National Endowment for 
the Arts. 
<P>The head of Americans United is Barry Lynn, a Protestant minister and former 
legislative counsel for the ACLU.  Lynn is arguably the leading proponent in the country 
of the idea that the sale of pornography should be a protected First Amendment right.  
William A. Donohue documents this in his book <I>Twilight of Liberty: The Legacy of the 
ACLU</I>.  When President Reagan announced in 1984 that a commission would be formed to 
study pornography, Lynn &quot;took issue with the President's characterization of 
pornography as a `problem.'&quot;  According to Lynn, 
&quot;Although we are far from a sexually 
enlightened society today, our greater openness 
about sex should be viewed as a reasonable explanation for much of the growth in 
sexually-explicit materials.&quot; 
<P>Americans United is not an organization known for moderation.  Originally called 
Protestants United for the Separation of Church and State, it is committed to driving 
religion from public life.
<P>For instance, Americans United, together with the ACLU and the Milwaukee 
Teachers' Association, the local NEA affiliate, 
brought suit challenging Wisconsin's school choice plan, which would enable poor families 
to send their kids to private schools.  Americans United argues that the plan and other 
voucher plans violate the establishment clause of 
the first amendment.  The group also opposes a school-prayer amendment to the 
Constitution, opposes legislation to allow 
religious institutions to administer social service 
programs, and opposes parental rights legislation.
<P>Lynn has labelled as &quot;a religious tyranny amendment&quot; a proposed Religious 
Equality Amendment to the Constitution.  The amendment, which was submitted by Rep. 
Henry Hyde, states that neither the federal government nor any state government shall 
deny benefits to or discriminate against any per<BR>
son on account of religious expression.
<P>In September, Americans United launched a national campaign to dissuade 
churches from distributing Christian Coalition 
voter guides.  It warned churches that by doing so they, in Lynn's words, &quot;run the risk of 
having their tax-exempt status challenged and possibly revoked.&quot;  Lynn argues that 
Pat Robertson and the Christian Coalition seek to &quot;create what amounts to a theocracy 
in America.&quot;  Americans United also has a project to encourage people to report to 
the I.R.S. churches that they believe are improperly engaging in politics.
<P>Lynn was quick to criticize Supreme Court Associate Justice Antonin Scalia for an 
address he made at a Mississippi prayer breakfast this spring.  Scalia descried the 
scorn suffered by people of faith and criticized elites who denigrate religious belief.  As if 
to prove the point, Scalia was immediately pilloried by those who are uncomfortable at 
the mention of morality.  Lynn was quoted in <I>U.S. News &amp; World Report</I> as commenting 
that Scalia's speech &quot;undermines public confidence in his objectivity&quot; on 
church-state issues.
<P>Lynn is also troubled by congressional chaplains who since the first Congress 
in 1789 have opened each day with prayer.  He believes the salaries Congress pays 
chaplains are a &quot;direct subsidy of religion which has no place in a Congress which ought 
to care about . . . the Constitution.&quot;
<P>It's ironic that the Interfaith Alliance, a self-proclaimed mainsteam faith-based 
group, is allied with an advocacy group dedicated 
to eradicating the public expression of religion.
<P>
<a name="#6"></a>
<B>Don't Tell Us What Your Against; Tell Us What You're For</B>
<P>
<DD>The irony disappears when you realize that the Interfaith Alliance has little to do 
with religion.  Rarely is there any mention of God in its literature.  It espouses no tenets 
of theology.  Even its professed values are generic and watery platitudes  &quot;The 
Interfaith Alliance believes in the dignity of the individual and the importance of 
community.&quot;
<P>Moreover, the Interfaith Alliance has no agenda of its own.  Although it clearly 
supports a raft of Democratic policy positions on health care, the environment, the 
minimum wage and so on, its raison d' etre is 
bashing the Christian Coalition.  Perusing press 
clippings one finds that the Alliance is rarely quoted in support of a policy or proposal. 
 Instead, it is almost always mentioned in context: denouncing the Christian Coalition.
<P>The Interfaith Alliance is a parasitical organization.  Without the activism of 
religious conservatives, the liberal left would have 
no use for it.

<center><h2>Why Did America's First Woman Televsion sportscaster become a
conservative radio talk-show hostess?</h2><BR>
</center>
<center><h3>by Laurence Jarvik</h3></center>
<blockquote>
<P>
<DD><FONT SIZE=+2><I>J</I></FONT>ane Chastain lives about as far as it is possible to be from
Washington, DC's notorious Beltway. Her home sits atop a mountain
outside Palm Springs, California. She commutes to her apperances
on CNN and Crawford broadcasting's radio shows in her Cessna 336
from the landing strip in front of her home (both she and her
husband, Roger Chastain, are licensed pilots with multiand instrument
ratings). Chastain is a frequent guest on &quot;CNN and Company&quot;
and author of <I>I'd Speak Out On The Issues If I Only Knew What
To Say</I> (Regal Books, 1987). She contributed a chapter to <I>Good
Will Toward Men</I> (St. Martin's Press, 1994), a book in praise of
the masculine sex and has her own newsletter called <I>On The Issues</I>.
Her Crawford Broadcasting radio talk show, &quot;What Washington
Doesn't Want You To Know,&quot; is syndicated to l8 stations from
Southern California's KBRT. Chastain was one of the first &quot;Renaissance&quot;
women to join the prestigious Washington leadership group founded
by Ambassador Holland Coors and Nina May in 1983, which has grown
to 6,000 members.
<P>
Chastain began her career as &quot;Coach Friday&quot; on Atlanta's WAGA in 1963,
 eventually moving to Miami's WTVJ, where for 9 years she worked as a sports reporter. 
She syndicated a radio series called <I>Football for Women</I>--ironically designed to
explain the sport to her husband, a race car driver and designer
who didn't understand the principles of the game--followed by
another series of 260 shows called Girls Rules, syndicated to
205 radio stations. This led to a television deal: 195 90--second
spots syndicated to 88 television stations called <I>The Jane Chastain
Show: Evertyhing You've Always Wanted To Know About Sports But
Were Afraid To Ask.</I> Still in her twenties, Jane Chastain was a
television star. In 1974 CBS hired her as the first woman network
sportscaster in the country. She covered NBA basketball, the Pan
American Games, pro golf, tennis, cycling, and surfing. She was
a pit reporter for auto racing coverage. Most importantly, Chastain
covered NFL football, including the Sun Bowl and the Cotton Bowl,
and developed stong ties to the Miami Dolphins and their winning
coach, Don Shula.
<P>
<BR>
When Chastain first came to Dolphin coach George Wilson,  however, he objected 
to the idea of a woman sportscaster. &quot;Well, she won't come to my
camp, &quot; Wilson vowed. Chastain patiently persevered, attended
training camp, and by the end of the season Wilson had responded
to her determination. He came up to her and announced, &quot;I'll
give you that interview.&quot; After the session, she recalled,
&quot;the players ran over, picked me up, and threw me in the
Dumpster. And it was like saying, 'Okay, you've made it; you've
been accepted; you're one of us. Congratulations.'&quot; Unlike
some feminists who might have filed a harrassment complaint these
days, Chastain took her experience as a compliment. She later
told an interviewer, &quot;Well, I think it was a friendly gesture.
I hadn't tried to make an issue of what Wilson was doing. I never
went up to those players and bellyached and complained about their
boss; I never put them in a compromising position of having to
talk to me about what an awful person Coach Wilson was. I think
the fact that I didn't make an issue out if it is actually what
caused him to address it. If you have a disagreement with somebody
and you try to back them up against the wall, then they get caught
up in defending themselves rather than examining their own position
to see if it's tenable.&quot;  Chastain has overcome personal
obstacles as well. When an Atlanta station executive started giving
her a hard time, after confessing he was in love with her and
finding himself rejected, Chastain went looking for another job.
She got an interview at a Raleigh, North Carolina television station
and was hired by Jesse Helms -- over vocal objections from the
station's executive vice-president, who didn't believe women should
cover sports.  &quot;It makes the hair on the back of my neck
stand up when I hear accusations that Jesse's against women,&quot;
Chastain says. &quot;I expected my career was over, and he gave
me a chance. He did more for hiring women and people of color
than anyone I knew in broadcasting.&quot; 
<P>
<BR>
Locker rooms held no charm for Chastain at first, and she tried to avoid entering the male  
domain while working at local stations. &quot;I didn't think
they should have to give interviews in various stages of undress,&quot;
she says. But when she became the first woman sportscaster for
CBS in 1974, Chastain was required to go inside to conduct interviews
in order to meet -- and beat -- her competitors.  The invasion
of privacy still rankles her. &quot;You will not find any men
demanding access to the female's dressing rooms. They have not
allowed male reporters in there. Yet, on the other side, in the
male locker room, everyone is afraid to say no.&quot; Chastain
dealt with the challenge as discreetly as possible, setting up
her cameras facing a wall by the door so that she would not be
exposed to the athletes against their will, and arranging to leave
the locker room as soon as the interviews had been completed.
&quot;Now, that didn't mean I was a prude,&quot; she recalled.
&quot;I'd been married for a number of years and didn't expect
to see anything that I hadn't seen before. I just respected their
privacy.&quot; But her personal experience with the double standard
helped plant a seed of doubt about the claims of the feminist
movement.  Eventually, America's first female sportscaster would
become a devoted opponent of the goals and tactics of the women's
liberation movement.
<P>
<BR>
Motherhood made all the difference for Jane 
   Chastain. She realized her viewpoint was 
       no longer that of a careerist in 1975 while covering the
Pan American Games for CBS. &quot;When I called home every night
and heard my baby cry, that's when my own priorities changed,&quot;
she recalled.&quot; And it didn't take long for me to discover
that the quality of time I was able to give my family was actually
in an inverse ratio to the quantity of time I spent on my job.&quot;
In 1976 she became sports anchor at KABC in Los Angeles, and in
1978 struck out on her own as a documentary filmmaker, author,
and radio personality on both National Public Radio and the Sports
Radio Network. Yet in her work, Chastain decided to confront feminism
directly, pointing out that sixty-one percent of the nation's
top female executives are childless, as opposed to fourteen percent
of the women in the general population.&quot;I talked about the
fact that female physicians take fewer patients per hour, and
choose to work fewer hours,&quot; she says. &quot;You don't get
to the top job on flextime.&quot; Chastain said she realized that
feminists &quot;don't play fair, they want their piece of cake
and yours, too.&quot; Soon Chastain was in the public eye as a
vocal opponent of the movement. She testified to the Presidential
Commission on Women in Combat against sending women into battle,
in her newsletter she published the findings of the Center for
Military Readiness on double standards applied to female aviators,
and she wrote columns arguing that the feminists were prepared
to sacrifice the lives of American women to promote their ideology.
&quot;Is it fair that we ask these same women to go into combat
against the all-male armies of countries that are not equal opportunity
employers?&quot; she asked. &quot;Our women will be putting out
an equal effort, but in the end they will be dying in unequal
numbers.&quot;

<center><h2>Inside the Ford Foundation's Plan to Split Apart America </h2>
<h3>by Linda Chavez and Jorge Amselle</h3></center>
<p>
The roots of the Ford Foundation's support for Hispanic political activism can be traced to the late McGeorge
Bundy, National Security Adviser to Presidents Kennedy and Johnson
and president of the Ford Foundation from 1966 to 1979.  A high-minded
Boston Brahmin eager to turn from badly advising Lyndon Johnson
on Vietnam war policy to establishing domestic social priorities,
Bundy concentrated his efforts at Ford on improving American education
and on ending racial discrimination. 
<P>
&quot;He came to the foundation determined
to put as much distance as possible between himself and the horror
in the Far East,&quot; Waldemar Neilsen said in his book <I>The
Golden Donors</I>, &quot;to achieve high visibility for himself
as a liberal domestic reformer.&quot; Bundy made a dramatic series
of grants to change the direction of the foundation quickly. He
funded direct action protests by community groups, voter registration
drives, and even some outreach programs to urban street gangs.
With the Ford Foundation on their side beneficiaries quickly becme
&quot;more strident in their demands and more involved in local
politics,&quot; according to Neilsen. Congressman Wright Patman
went to the House floor to ask, &quot;Does the Ford Foundation
have a grandiose design to bring vast political, economic, and
social changes to the nation?&quot; The answer was yes. What Neilsen
called Bundy's &quot;sneering contempt&quot; during congressional
hearings led Patman to place legal prohibitions on &quot;political
and propagandistic grants&quot; and restrictions on voter registration
projects.
<P>&quot;Henry Ford II was close to 'going crazy'
with Bundy's 'progressive' _ and to his mind _  wastrel politics,&quot;
writes Georgie Anne Geyer in her new book <I>Americans No More
</I>[see review by Robert Huberty on page 8]. &quot;Ford dealers
across the country were bitterly complaining to him that Bundy's
policies were ruining their businesses: Thousands of Americans
were refusing to buy Fords.&quot;
<P>
As I first  pointed out in my book, <I>Out
Of The Barrio</I> (NY: Basic Books, 1991) Ford repeated  a pattern
characteristic of the political trends of the 1960s and 70s and
Bundy's liberalism played straight into the hands of ethnic activists.
They exploited liberalism's well-meaning and expansive social
concerns by advancing an aggressive political agenda undermining
America's tradition of equal opportunity.  The new Hispanic organizations
were products of  the Ford Foundation and it must bear a heavy
burden of responsibility for their actions. The Ford Foundation
was the leading funder of Hispanic advocacy groups.
<P>
Bundy's interest in Hispanic politics arose
from a 1968 study that the Ford Foundation commissioned on Hispanics
in America.  This was originally an internal document that would
guide the foundation and help direct its agenda and grantmaking
to Hispanics. 
<P>
The report concluded that Mexican Americans
were disorganized and fragmented and in need of a national organization
to serve their social, economic and political needs.  Siobhan
Oppenheimer Nicolau, a former Ford Foundation program officer
who guided Ford's early decisions to fund Hispanic organizations,
stated in 1990 that foundation officials thought Mexican Americans
were unable to create and sustain a network of viable institutions.
 Why?  &quot;They lacked the strong network of religious institutions
that had nurtured black leadership.  They lacked visibility outside
the Southwest, and they lacked a history of slavery, a powerful
tool that had galvanized white guilt and support for the black
civil rights movement.&quot;
<P>
To this day Ford officials use the same rhetoric.
Susan Vail Berresford, current president of the Ford Foundation,
wrote in the October 14, 1996 <I>National Review</I>, &quot;Our
grants to Hispanic-led groups to strengthen their communities
and improve their level of participation in American society hardly
constitute an &quot;attack on American democracy.&quot;<BR>
<P>
<a href="#top">Table of Contents</a>
<a name="2">
<P>
<B>Present at the Creation</B>
<P>
Relying on these conclusions, the Ford Foundation decided 
to create two major Hispanic organizations.  In 1968 it established
the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund (MALDEF)
which was intended to use lawsuits, and courtroom and legislative
 maneuvering to promote public policy. In fact, the organization
was a creature of the Ford Foundation, and as she wrote in response
to Berresford in the same issue of <I>National Review</I>, &quot;would
not exist without foundation funding.&quot;
<P>
In 1968, too,  Ford funded the Southwest
Council of La Raza as an organization coordinating other organizations
-- which later became the National Council of La Raza, described
as &quot;the Latino equivalent of the Urban League.&quot;
<P>
It was a still a creature of the Ford Foundation,
dependent on annual grants from New York City and unrepresentative
of Hispanic Americans.
<P>
In the nearly three decades since their establishment,
these organizations, MALDEF in particular, have played an enormous
role in shaping public policy toward Hispanics, on everything
from immigration to education to voting laws.  In 1975 MALDEF
was instrumental in amending the 1965 Voting Rights Act to force
jurisdictions with significant numbers of voters identified as
Hispanic to receive voting materials in Spanish.  Today, more
than 270 jurisdictions are affected by this requirement.  Under
the act, jurisdictions in Michigan and elsewhere are required
to print Spanish language ballots at considerable cost even though
practically no one uses them.
<P>
From 1968 to 1975, MALDEF pushed through bilingual
education programs and requirements across the country.  They
have trapped Hispanic students in what are essentially Spanish-language
maintenance and development programs.  A September 1996 poll of
Hispanic parents by the Center for Equal Opportunity shows that
the vast majority of Hispanics don't agree with groups like MALDEF
on bilingual education. [see box on p.4] This national survey
found that 63 percent of Hispanic parents say they want their
children to learn English as quickly as possible. Only 16.9% want
Spanish taught first. Over 80 percent want their children's academic
courses to be taught in English and not Spanish.  But the bilingual
education programs favored by MALDEF do just the opposite.  They
teach schoolchildren almost exclusively in Spanish throughout
grade school and sometimes through high school.
<P>
The Ford Foundation remains the largest single
source of funding for MALDEF and NCLR.  According to Geyer, NCLR
in 1989 received $590,000 from Ford, a major share of its $3.5
million budget that year.  In 1991 it received $1.25 million from
Ford.  From 1968 to 1990 Ford gave more than $9.6 million to NCLR
and $14.2 million to MALDEF.  Susan Vail Berresford, the Ford
Foundation's current president, was a keynote speaker at NCLR's
annual conference in Denver this past July.  She was given NCLR's
President's Award for her leadership and commitment to NCLR. 
With ten thousand participants, this was NCLR's largest conference,
and it featured sessions on issues like: How to defend affirmative
action. 
<P>
Yet, NCLR's growth has blunted some of its
ideological edge, at least when it comes to raising money, and
this has led to tensions within the organization.  Funding for
the Denver conference, which cost $1.2 million, left some activists
fuming.  Specifically, critics complained that NCLR should not
have accepted a $25,000 sponsorship fee from the Golden, Colorado-based
Coors Brewing Company.  Some conservative members of the Coors
family have supported proposals to make English the official language
of the United States and have opposed racial preference policies.
<P>
NCLR, however, has learned the political and
financial ropes, and it knows how to run its organization and
agenda along several tracks.  As Raul Yzaguirre, president of
NCLR -- and past Chairman of Independent Sector, a group founded
by Common Cause's John Gardner to promote networking for social
change among non-profits -- explained to a reporter for the <I>Denver
Post</I>:  &quot;We learned how to do things right.&quot; Yzaguirre
added. &quot;We analyzed public policy, earned a reputation the
hard way, as reasonable, hard&#173;minded, objective [people].
Developing friends on [Capitol] Hill, then moving on to new areas.&quot;
Yzaguirre denies that NCLR's competence in Washington lobbying
has put it out of touch with the average Hispanic.  He told the
<I>Post</I>,  &quot;Check the polls, on every issue -&#173; civil
rights, education, housing, equal access -&#173; we [Hispanics]
are together.&quot; 
<P>
But polling data shows that Hispanics are not united behind NCLR positions.
Nevertheless, Yzaguirre is among the organizers for a Columbus Day protest march in Washington
DC -- endorsed by the U.S. Catholic Conference, Congressional Hispanic
Caucus, and other organizations -- whose leader, Los Angeles activist
Juan Jose Guiterrez told <I>The Washington Post</I>, &quot;To
the best of my knowledge, the great majority of the American public
does not support a fascist police state.&quot;
<p>
Despite their ability to stage media events,
MALDEF, NCLR, and other Hispanic advocacy organizations funded
by the Ford Foundation are not directly accountable to the community
whose interests they purport to represent.  The Hispanic community
does not elect the members, officers, or board of these organizations,
most of which pursue their objectives with little public scrutiny.
 Because they are not membership organizations dependent on individual
contributions from the community at large, few Mexican Americans
can name these groups.  Their leaders are unknown despite their
influence on public policy affecting Hispanics.  The Hispanic
community does not control the funding of these groups and, most
importantly, it has virtually no say in the agenda they choose
to promote.  The Ford Foundation and other grantmakers have freed
these organizations from the need to be accountable to the communities
they are supposed to represent.  And they have created a cadre
of ethnic power brokers instead of identifying legitimate representatives
from the Hispanic community.
<P>
These groups believe they are on the cutting
edge of social change.  But the future they envision is one in
which Hispanics become wards of government permanently entitled
to public benefits because of their ethnicity.  Most  Hispanics,
like other groups before them, would choose to become part of
the mainstream. Instead, these groups speak of &quot;empowering&quot;
Hispanics by defining them as members of a protected class. They
want to empower Hispanic children by winning court battles that
will require them to be taught in Spanish for a society where
the best jobs go to those who speak, read, and write English well.
 They insist that the fortunes of middle&#173;class Hispanics
must be determined by the political battles over the most disadvantaged
Hispanics, making the former hostage to the latter.  Only the
lobbyists and activists who broker the policies of the welfare
state benefit from such strategies.
<P>
With $7.5 billion in assets, you would think
the Ford Foundation would want to do something other than fund
organizations intent on dividing Americans along racial and ethnic
lines. Yet Ford has been, and continues to be, the philanthropic
foundation most heavily involved in Hispanic advocacy politics.
<P>
<a href="#top">Table of Contents</a>
<a name="3">
<P>
<B>WHO DO FORD'S HISPANIC GROUPS REPRESENT?
</B><P>
Ford's decision to create political advocacy organizations was not
  needed by the Hispanic community,. Hispanic have never required
 exclusive ethnic-based mediating structures to serve their
interests.  Working-class Hispanics, for example, have often
preferred labor unions to represent them.  Mexican Americans and
other Hispanic groups serve in leadership positions in the Steelworkers,
United Auto Workers, Food and Commercial Workers, and other industrial
unions in the Midwest and Southwest, as well as in the United
Farm Workers union in California.  The executive vice-president
of the AFL-CIO, Linda Chavez-Thompson, is an Hispanic. 
<P>
Other Hispanics turn to the Catholic Church
to mediate their grievances, and there is a growing evangelical
Protestant ministry to Hispanics.  Many middle-class Hispanics
have joined local civic and business groups that target their
economic or social interests rather than their ethnicity.  In
addition, there are well-established organizations such as
the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC).  Founded
in 1929, it is the nation's oldest Hispanic organization dedicated
to assimilation and integration into the larger American society.
 The American G.I. Forum is also an Hispanic group which represents
the needs of  veterans. These Hispanic groups typically pursue
assimilationist goals.  LULAC, for instance, lists the following
member duty in its declaration of purpose: &quot;To foster the
acquisition and facile use of the official language of our country
that we may thereby equip ourselves and our families for the fullest
enjoyment of our rights and privileges and the efficient discharge
of our duties and obligations to this, our country.&quot; Unfortunately,
by the 1970s, LULAC too had veered far to the left, and now is
almost no different from NCLR and MALDEF.
<P>
The original goals of assimilation seemed to suit the majority of Hispanics in 
America --but not the Ford Foundation.  Ford has pursued an agenda that separates 
Hispanics from other Americans and classifies them as a permanent underclass.
 The Ford Foundation instead attempts to copy the political strategies
of the black civil rights movement.  Relying on the advice of
a handful of Mexican American activists like Chicano academics
Julian Samora and Ernesto Galarza and political operator Herman
Gallegos, Ford in the 1960s decided to create new Hispanic institutions
to adopt an anti-assimilationist agenda and supplant the
traditional voices of the Hispanic community in America.
<P>
In its eagerness to mobilize social discontent,
the Ford Foundation has occasionally helped its operatives go
over the line that separates dissent from incitement to violence.
 In 1969, Jose Angel Gutierrez, founder of the La Raza Unida political
party in Texas, told a group of reporters at a press conference
that, &quot;We have got to eliminate the gringo, and what I mean
by that is if the worst comes to the worst, we have got to kill
him.&quot;  Gutierrez was affiliated with the Mexican America
Youth Organization (MAYO) which had received a $10,000 grant from
a Ford Foundation grantee.  Texas Democratic Congressman Henry
B. Gonzalez was so enraged by Gutierrez' rhetoric that he took
to the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives to accuse him
of promoting racial hatred.  Gonzalez attacked the Ford Foundation
for indirectly supporting La Raza Unida through its grant to MAYO.
<P>
Fearing that the incident would strengthen
efforts then underway in Congress to limit political advocacy
by tax-exempt foundations, Ford announced at the time that
MAYO was barred from receiving additional Ford money.  However,
some at Ford continued to defend Gutierrez.  For instance, Siobhan
Nicolau, the Ford Foundation program officer, contended that Gutierrez
was provoked to make the statement by hostile questions from the
press.
<P>
Despite incidents like these, Ford has not
been deterred from its commitment to establish extremely political
Hispanic advocacy organizations.  Whatever activists claim, Hispanic
Americans simply have not faced the same level of racial hostility
that African Americans have encountered, and their history in
this country is very different from that of Hispanics.
<P>
Although they have had their difficulties,
Hispanics have never faced the kind of political and legal discrimination
suffered by blacks.  Segregationist Jim Crow laws did not cover
Mexican Americans in the Southwest, for example.
<P>
And although de facto segregation of Hispanic
children existed in South Texas and to a lesser extent in California,
this segregation was not sanctioned by law and it was struck down
when challenged in the courts. As early as 1931 Hispanic parents
had won the right to send their children to school with non-Hispanics
-- even where local officials tried to prevent it.
<P>
<a href="#top">Table of Contents</a>
<a name="4">
<P>
<B>IN FORD'S DEEP POCKETS</B>
<P>
Despite these historical differences, Ford funds nonprofit
organizations that it hopes will recreate the black civil rights
movement for Hispanics. In 1968, it provided grants to ASPIRA,
the Spanish acronym for a New York City-based Puerto Rican education
group, allowing it to replicate its activities elsewhere.  ASPIRA
was instrumental in forcing New York City schools to test all
Hispanic children for placement in all-Spanish &quot;bilingual
education programs&quot; that claimed to be bilingual although
teaching in only one language -- Spanish.  The result of this mandatory
program has been that many non-Spanish speaking children
with Spanish surnames have been placed in Spanish language programs,
even if their parents wished the children to learn English. They
were segregated from the English speaking population. 
<P>
In 1972, Ford helped create the Puerto Rican
Legal Defense and Education Fund to mimic MALDEF's activities.
 In 1974, it provided operating funds for the Southwest Voter
Registration Education Project and later the Midwest Voter Registration
Education Project.  All of these shared Ford's segregation-oriented
priorities, rather than respond to the needs of an increasingly
assimilated Hispanic population.  
<P>
Other Hispanic organizations and programs
that have received large Ford Foundation grants include the National
Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials (NALEO)
Education Fund, the National Puerto Rican Coalition, and the Hispanic
Leadership Opportunity Program, which provides internships in
government agencies and public policy groups.  In addition, the
Ford Foundation has contributed to a number of academic programs
for Hispanics, including grants for Hispanic research to the City
University of New York, the University of Texas, and the University
of Michigan. Some of this reasarch has been legitimate scholarship.
 It was in 1963 that Ford funded a major UCLA study of Mexican
Americans. The &quot;Mexican American Study Project&quot; would
span five years and it involved field research in twenty cities.
 What resulted was an authoritative work on the history, demography,
institutions, and political participation of Mexican Americans:
 <I>The Mexican American People: The Nation's Second Largest Minority</I>,
by UCLA professors Leo Grebler, Joan Moore, and Ralph Guzman.
However, many of the more recent Ford-funded programs have been
politically tendentious rather than scholarly.
<P>
Other grantmaking foundations like Carnegie
and Rockefeller also fund Hispanic advocacy organizations as do
the philanthropic arms of corporations like Coors, Kellogg's,
Anheuser-Busch, BankAmerica and Pepsico.  The federal government
has also provided grants to Hispanic advocacy groups for job training
and other programs.  But neither the federal government nor any
other grantmaker has matched Ford in terms of long-term commitment
or amount of money contributed.  Indeed, the Ford Foundation has
virtually created the infrastructure of the contemporary Hispanic
policy movement.
<P>
With the support of the Ford Foundation, the
anti-assimilationist Hispanic organizations have scored notable
successes in politics and public relations at the expense of the
rich vitality and diversity of the community of Americans of Hispanic
origin. 
<P>
<a href="#top">Table of Contents</a>
<a name="5"><B>
<P>
PERPETUATING  STEREOTYPES</B>
<P>
Today, as a result of the efforts of the Ford Foundation,  in the
public mind and for all agencies of the U.S. government the
entire Hispanic American population is classified as a disadvantaged
minority group.  This encompasses the native-born and the recent
immigrant:  rich, white-European Argentine or Cuban Americans
as well as English-speaking blacks from Central America's
Caribbean coast.  It covers the Nahuatl-speaking Mexican
Indian and Peruvian-born descendants of Japanese immigrants to
South America.  For the purpose of political organization, it
makes no difference whether the &quot;Hispanic&quot; is a new
arrival or a citizen whose family has lived in the United States
for a dozen generations, descendants of holders of the Spanish
land grants covering millions of acres, or the head of the Coca-Cola
Corporation.
<P>
By linking disparate groups together and claiming
to represent them all, Hispanic organizations have been able to
acquire political power.  By promoting divisions between Hispanics
and non-Hispanics, they have maintained and strengthened
their power through &quot;divide and conquer&quot; tactics.  In
particular, they have encouraged the mind-set of the dependent
Hispanic &quot;victim&quot; _ something NCLR does especially well.
 Raul Yzaguirre, NCLR president, plays on these insecurities.
 He told the<I> Rocky Mountain News</I> this past summer:  &quot;The
bigotry and racism sweeping our country should be of concern not
just to minorities but to all Americans.  We will no longer tolerate
those in our society who fan the flames of this hatred to further
their careers or their political aspirations.&quot;
<P>
In 1994 Yzaguirre's inflamatory remarks were
reported in <I>Ethnic NewsWatch</I> published by a Hispanic news
group.  He told an Hispanic audience that &quot;every single federal
program and almost every public program discriminates against
Latinos.  That is not an accusation.  It's a fact.  Those realities
don't happen by accident.  Nobody else has less political power
in proportion to their numbers.&quot;
<P>
Yzaguirre also boasted of the increased political
clout Hispanic organizations like his could muster:  &quot;That
infrastructure has made it possible to have a rise in political
power. Now there are over five thousand elected Latino officials.
 <I>Hay orgullo.  Hay esperanza.</I>  We know we'll fulfill Walt
Whitman's prediction that Mexican Americans in the Southwest would
be the salvation of this country.&quot;
<P>
<a href="#top">Table of Contents</a>
<a name="6"><B>
<P>
THE AGENDA BEHIND FORD'S AGENDA
</B><P>
That MALDEF and NCLR understand the political importance of
dividing Americans this way is apparent in the kinds of public
policy issues they pursue most vigorously.  In immigration policy,
they ardently defend high levels of immigration and generous social
and safety net programs for immigrants.  Yet according to the
National Latino Political Survey, 75 percent of Mexican Americans
feel that there are too many immigrants in the U.S. now.  MALDEF
ignores the opinions of the people it claims to represent because
it knows that high levels of immigration serve its own purposes.
<P>
In areas like income and education, the continued
immigration of low-skilled and poorly-educated Hispanics
keeps general Hispanic achievement levels below that of non-Hispanic
whites.  This justifies the panoply of government programs that
advocacy groups say Hispanics want and need.  In fact, second
and third generation Hispanics are very much assimilated and enjoy
earnings and education levels comparable to non-Hispanics.
 On average, the weekly earnings of native-born Mexican American
men are about 83 percent those of non-Hispanic white men.
 When variables like schooling, experience, hours worked, and
geographical region of residence are taken into account, Mexican
American men earn about 93 percent of the weekly earnings of comparable
non-Hispanic white men.
<P>
Because Hispanics do not share any common
racial characteristics or national histories, political advocacy
groups like MALDEF and NCLR focus on language and culture to reinforce
a separate Hispanic ethnic identity.  With this goal in mind,
programs such as bilingual education become tools used to maintain
Hispanic language and culture and reduce the possibility of assimilation,
particularly among children.  By devaluing the importance of English
to American citizens, the bilingual ballot elevates Spanish and
makes it a quasi-official language.  These ballots are also used
to include Hispanics under the provisions of the Voting Rights
Act, which virtually guarantees ethnically-gerrymandered Hispanic
congressional districts. 
<P>
Because Hispanic organizations want to segregate
the community they claim to represent from the mainstream of America's
democracy, they hold in contempt all proposals to make English
the official language of the United States.  Yet significant numbers
of Hispanics do not agree.  The National Latino Political Survey
found in 1992 that well over 40 percent of Mexican Americans and
almost 50 percent of Puerto Ricans support legislation to make
English America's official language. That is significant support
for &quot;English Only.&quot;
<P>
Affirmative action, a program that richly
rewards racial and ethnic identity politics, is also used to divide
us.  Middle and upper-class Hispanics have always been assimilated
into mainstream American culture to a very great extent.  The
intermarriage rate between Hispanics and non-Hispanics, which
is almost 50 percent for Mexican Americans in California, is only
one indication of the effects of the process of assimilation.
 But ethnicity-based preferences and set-asides are a great incentive
for any group to identify itself by ethnicity.  Any group that
is offered preferential treatment in admission to universities,
jobs and job promotions, and non-competitive awards of government
contracts that pay well above the market rate is sure to take
advantage.  But it is also likely eventually to lose support from
the majority of those who receive no such privileges.  And the
genuine achievements of members of a politically-preferred ethnic
group will come under unfair suspicion. 
<P>
Nevertheless, over the past year the Ford
Foundation has distributed $1.4 million in grants to a dozen organizations
for litigation, research, and advocacy in favor of affirmative
action.  This year the Ford Foundation has contributed over $500,000
to several organizations specifically opposing California's Proposition
209, which is also known as the California Civil Rights Initiative.
 MALDEF launched legal challenges and a media campaign to defeat
the ballot initiative that would bar the state of California from
using race, ethnicity, or gender to discriminate against or grant
preferential treatment to any person or group.  No doubt, if the
measure passes, groups supported by the Ford Foundation will challenge
its constitutionality all the way to the Supreme Court.
<P>
The success or failure of this ballot proposition
to endure such challenges from Ford and its operatives will determine
whether America takes a step forward or backwards from equal opportunity
for all.

<I>Americans No More: The Death of Citizenship by Georgie Anne Geyer (Atlantic Monthly Press, 1996, 352 pages.) 
</I>
It is syndicated columnist Georgie Anne Geyer's thesis that the concept of citizenship has lost meaning for increasing numbers of Americans.
The civic bond that links Americans of all backgrounds by a committment to certain universal ideas of freedom and equality is unravelling. The
signs are everywhere, not least in the debate over how we decide who is an American. 
<P>
Geyer argues that the decline of citizenship has been hastened by political actions and economic developments that are driving us apart. At
home, politicians and advocacy groups are exploiting racial and ethnic conflict and are "retribalizing" communities to acquire political power.
This development is worldwide. In the former Yugoslavia, in India and Lebanon, and now in the U.S. politicians are making their careers by
demanding group rights and legal privileges for specific nationalities and subcultures. In America they are abetted by ethnic group advocacy
organizations that derive their support from private foundation grants and not from the ethnic groups they purport to represent. Geyer
describes how this process is fostering disunity in the name of diversity and only benefits those whose careers depend on it. As political and
media elites celebrate multiculturalism and denigrate individual merit and equal opportunity, the idea of a common American civic culture
atrophies. 
<P>
In contrast to domestic politics, U.S. economic institutions increasingly operate in a global marketplace. Politicians and government
bureaucrats are losing control over currency exchange rates, labor and capital markets, and the flow of information. Most conservatives
welcome this trend because it increases the power of the individual. But Geyer worries that globalization will make us less respectful of national laws and patriotic sentiments. American financial and government leaders will feel more at home dealing with their foreign counterparts over abstract issues than with the real problems of their fellow countrymen: No longer farmers and merchants in the town square, they will decide price changes and power shifts in conference calls at international airports between flights to high-level conferences. Officials of international agencies and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) will also relax their national loyalties as they roam the world offering money and advice. Can such people recognize the tangible obligations and benefits of citizenship? 
<P>
In such a world what becomes of Americans who, as Tocqueville observed, join local associations to accomplish tasks without government
but with their neighbors? What will sustain citizens when the laws and institutions that guarantee equal opportunity are delegitimized at home
and displaced abroad? 
<P>
Geyer blames U.S. policymakers for letting special interest groups take the initiative in determining what new citizens and immigrants will think about America. As a journalist, she has roamed the country talking with scholars and public officials. Her interviews with those who are in charge of administering the laws regulating U.S. immigration and naturalization are especially revealing, and this reporting is the most valuable part of her book. 
<P>
For instance, Geyer reports in detail on the dumbed-down U.S. citizenship exams that the Immigration Act of 1990 now permits the nonprofit
Educational Testing Service (ETS) to administer. In place of requiring immigrants to give oral responses to questions posed by an Immigration
and Naturalization Service (INS) officer at a government office, officials say immigrants can choose to take a user-friendly ETS multiple choice test at a community center. And they can take the test as many times as they need to pass it. ETS proudly reports that it relies on a battery of Hispanic and refugee organizations like the Mexican American Legal Defense and and Education Fund (MALDEF) for advice on its testing policies and procedures. 
<P>
Instead of "Americanizing" new citizens, Geyer says ethnic advocacy groups are promoting a "reverse colonization" that would adapt our
citizenship to the ethnicity of the immigrant. Groups like MALDEF help immigrants become U.S. citizens without adequate knowledge of our
history, laws or language. They extract government entitlements for legal and illegal aliens, and raise obstacles to efforts to stop illegal
immigration. In lobbying over the content of civics in school textbooks and public ceremonies, ethnic advocacy groups too often sacrifice the ideas of the Founding Fathers to illiberal cultures of blood and soil. But most immigrants do not support their most strident demands. Surveys show that immigrants want to learn English quickly, to be assimilated to American culture, and to work and prosper. Far from being a cry of the people, MALDEF's legal briefs and the pronouncements of La Raza derive from the agenda of program officers at the Ford Foundation and other philanthropic grantmakers. Geyer's chapter on the Ford Foundation, excerpted in the National Review -- complemented by Linda Chavez and Jorge Amselle in this issue -- reviews the history of Ford's imposed revolution from above. 
<P>
Geyer's conclusion seems at odds with many of her findings. Apparently persuaded that Americans are throwing away their birthright and
overwhelmed by a sense of social breakdown, Geyer succumbs to emotions unsuited to the sharp reporting of her earlier chapters. She
describes the beauty of southern Wisconsin, where her family has a lakeside cottage, and compares it to an unlovely California marred by
criminal gangs, high taxes, overcrowding, gated communities, and illegal aliens. 
<P>
Instead of keeping her sights on the political and financial backers of ethnic political advocacy, she seems frightened by immigrants
themselves and appears to hold them responsible for the contrast that disturbs her. But America is more than southern Wisconsin, and the
type of political advocacy to which she objects would surely continue even without immigration. (If there were fewer universities, would
political correctness end?) 
<P>
Some argue that the alternative to the era of big government is big citizenship. Likewise, the alternative to the political demands of the ethnic
lobbies is to recognize and encourage the positive social achievements of immigrants.

Letters to the Editor</H3><BR>
<P>
 Thank you for the newsletter about
the Joyce Foundation. 
I know you write from a special viewpoint,
as is your right.  You'd have a better chance to sell
that view if you got the details right instead of getting into
a position where facts undermine your whole argument. Among the
serious errors in the article are these lesser ones pertaining
to me:
<P>
Daly is) &quot;a practicing Catholic.&quot;
That error made my Catholic mother-in-law happy but I remain a
non-practicing Protestant.
<P>
(Daly is) &quot;an active Democrat.&quot;
Nope,  just a registered, inactive Democrat who has crossed the
line often (and privately).
<P>
&quot;A lieutenant said...&quot; Nope.
Colonels makes those statements, lieutenants just get shot.
<P>
&quot;Daly did confess that he had
himself attended Columbia Journalism School on a $600 scholarship.&quot;
Wrong. I have never applied for or received a scholarship. At
Columbia I did get that money by winning a competition to determine
which student had acquired the best understanding of the laws
governing libel.
<P>
As your concluding lines suggested,
I have taken another look at the direction the Joyce Foundation
is heading. I am delighted with the course and hope I can help
Deborah Leff maintain it.

Congratulations on Alicia Shepard's meticulously researched and well written study
of Pew's foray into civic journalism [&quot;Buying Press Coverage:
How Pew's Civic Journalism Projects Put Newspapers, Radio and
Television Stations on the Payroll,&quot; vol. 1, no. 7].
<P>
While civic journalism may skew reporting
away from &quot;hard&quot; news and demanding examination of government
(and away form cynicism, its supporters would add), your article
displayed no such bias toward either side of the debate.
<P>
I was impressed and look forward to
future detailed examinations of foundations' activities.</FONT>

I wanted to tell you how much I enjoy
<I>Foundation Watch</I>. It tells me an awful lot about some villains
I didn't know nearly enough about, including the wicked Rebecca
Rimel. It is sickening to see what has happened to the Pew Foundation
under her regime, although there must have been some rot there
to have seen hiring her as a good idea in the first place. As
someone old enough to have recalled Howard Pew while he was still
alive (he was a doughty warrior in the labor-management wars of
the 30s and 40s, among other things) I can only be saddened by
yet one more 180 degree turn in a foundation that was set up for
totally different purposes than those which it now brazenly carries out.

In June, author Joe Maxwell attended the 
first-ever reunion of Booker T. Washington's descendants, which 
was held at the institution Washington founded, the 
Tuskegee Institute in Alabama. He records here his impressions of 
 the legacy of this great man.</font>

<P>
<a name="1">
<BR>
<P>Everything at Tuskegee seems to have changed for 
Ethelda Murray Hockett.  The room where once she learned 
the trade of &quot;domestic science&quot; is now a lavish testament to 
the man she reveres.  At one end of this massive boardroom, 
a life-size oil portrait of her uncle, Booker T. 
Washington, gazes from behind Mrs. Hockett's graying 
90-year-old head. Seated in her wheelchair, Mrs. Hockett has 
joined about 100 other relatives at a first-ever reunion 
of Washington's family.
<P>While Mrs. Hockett's creamy brown face registers 
justifiable pride, she also registers a melancholic hint of 
sorrow and regret as she wonders aloud what her uncle would 
think of his school today.
<P>&quot;You see,&quot; she notes in a wistful whisper, &quot;they've 
gotten away from the trades.&quot;
<P>In fact, Tuskegee University, a school founded with 
a $2,000 Alabama state grant in 1881 on the premise 
that every graduate should master basic academic 
disciplines and a marketable trade, no longer even has a &quot;trade 
building.&quot; Instead, the scores of stately Greek Revival 
brick buildings that Mr. Washington's early students built 
with their own hands are now completely devoted to 
&quot;higher&quot; academia.
<P>&quot;I have been told that the reason there has been such 
a transition is that the emphasis is more on the trades in 
higher development and sciences,&quot; continues Mrs. Hockett. 
&quot;Of course, in those early days, Dr. Washington was 
interested in young people who came to the school learning to use 
their hands so they could really help their family.&quot;
<P>Mr. Washington's niece is old enough to 
remember hearing her uncle preach his dignity-through-work 
vision for climbing out of slavery.  &quot;There is no position, 
however high in science or letters or politics, that I would 
withhold from any race, but I would have the foundation clear,&quot; 
Mr. Washington once said.  His goal crossed lines of race 
or class: &quot;Usefulness . . . is the supreme end of education.&quot; 
<P>Early in this century Mr. Washington's 
philosophical rivals overtook him, and they still reign today.  Where 
Mr. Washington emphasized respect earned, modern 
elitists have emphasized rights possessed.  Today, politicians 
and reporters now frequently babble that man's highest goal is education, 
defined most often in the narrow sense of 
a college degree.  Little is said about the usefulness of 
one's schooling.
<P>Yet market realities today vindicate Mr. 
Washington's wisdom: all-too-familiar are stories of college 
graduates who either can't find a job in their field, or find they 
have pursued a college degree that has prepared them for 
nothing useful.
<P>In the name of equality, Washington's opponents 
have virtually demanded that a college education be available 
to and sought by all, regardless of desires or talents.  No 
one, they suggest, should have to endure a life of manual labor.
<P>
This, of course, was just the sort of thinking 
Washington's life and words refute: &quot;The ambition to secure an 
education was most praiseworthy and encouraging.  The idea, 
however, was too prevalent that, as soon as one secured a 
little education, in some unexplainable way he would be 
free from most of the hardships of the world, and, at any 
rate, could live without manual labour.&quot; 
<P>
But Washington's opponents actually have erased 
the very thing they sought to achieve: options.  
Twenty-two-year-old John McLeod is a good example.  He feels 
torn between a truly valuable career and society's 
expectations. &quot;Part of me says that I ought to go on to college and get 
a degree just for the sense of accomplishment and 
because that is what society says I ought to do,&quot; confesses the 
lanky Mr. McLeod, adorned in a hairnet at the bagel shop 
where he works while considering his future goals.  &quot;But the 
other part of me says that I'm good with my hands--I can 
make a good living as a welder.&quot;
<P>Twice Mr. McLeod has entered Tennessee universities, only to exit 
without any clear goals.  He moved to Jackson, Mississippi, to apprentice as 
a welder.  &quot;I think I could make a living as a tradesman,&quot; he says. &quot;I'd like 
to have the option of schooling. . . .  But if I enjoy, say, being a mechanic or welder, I want to do 
it without any feelings of guilt or reservation because 
society might look down on a blue-collar job.&quot;
<P>Today's students often forgo the necessary and 
difficult training they need for a promising career in the 
trades. Many prefer the shiny bauble of an academic degree but 
no job prospects.
<P>
<a name="2">
<P><B>Washington and W.E.B. Du Bois</B>
<P>Booker T. Washington foresaw the problem of the dumbing down of America.  He did not diminish the 
importance of ideas, but he showed the earthy wisdom of 
someone who does not need the accolades of others.  Throughout 
his life, Washington was attacked mostly by Northern 
liberals, including W.E.B. Du Bois, who argued that blacks 
could not achieve equal status with whites except by radical, 
top-down intervention.  Washington championed work; Du 
Bois called for political action.  By the time Washington died 
in 1915, Du Bois seemed to have won the argument, 
especially given the establishment of Jim Crow laws in the South 
to impede black economic progress.  Washington soon 
was being called an &quot;Uncle Tom.&quot;
<P>&quot;Booker T. Washington was dealt one of the 
toughest hands of any black leader in American history,&quot; 
conservative black economist Thomas Sowell has written.  
Washington, says Sowell, understood that in the post-Civil 
War South, the fates of the black and white race were inextricably 
linked; merely looking at the statistical mix of the region70 percent white, 
30 percent blackmade that point clear. &quot;Washington was able to enlist 
the support of some whites by arguing that blacks would either help lift up the 
South or help to drag it down,&quot; says Sowell.
<P>
In actuality, argues Sowell, Du Bois and Washington were  
opposite sides of the same coin.  Du Bois concentrated his energy 
on ending the segregation which was held in place by the majority 
of whites, while  Washington focused on &quot;the internal 
self-development of blacks.&quot;  This led him to seek 
out and nurture positive relationships with those whites who would 
support his efforts.  &quot;The net result was that Washington was 
often praising whites of good will, while Du Bois was 
attacking whites of ill will,&quot; writes Sowell.
<P>
Both men recognized that, no matter when civil 
rights were secured, diligent, hard work would always be 
required for self-improvement.  Both men worried about those 
in their race who would seek a hollow sort of advancement 
that circumvented diligent labor.  Du Bois, notes Sowell, 
spoke of &quot;the Great Lack which faces our race in the 
modern world, lack of Energy,&quot; which he attributed to 
&quot;indolence&quot; growing out of tropical origins and which had now 
become a kind of &quot;social heredity.&quot;  Du Bois doubted that 
merely achieving certain rights would lead to the immediate 
improvement of his people: &quot;Some few would be 
promoted,&quot; observed Du Bois.  Nevertheless, &quot;the mass would 
remain as they are&quot; until the younger generation began to 
&quot;try harder&quot; as the race &quot;lost the omnipresent excuse for 
failure: prejudice.&quot;
<P>&quot;Du Bois' assessment of the black masses at that time 
was not very different from that of Booker T. Washington, 
who characterized many of them as sunk into `listless 
indifference, or shiftlessness, or reckless bravado,'&quot; asserts  Sowell.
<P>Over the long haul, however, the two men pursued 
different strategies.  Du Bois chose to concentrate his energies 
for improving his race on the &quot;talented tenth,&quot; those blacks 
who had been freed and gained social development before 
the Civil War.  Washington, on the other hand, staked his 
claim on improving the lives of the other 90 percent, those 
who lacked education and opportunities. Washington 
urged blacks to envision work as a divine right to be 
exercised along with the vote.  Washington also urged them to be 
self-reliant rather than reliant on whites, and he warned them 
not to be sidetracked by the &quot;geegaws&quot; of their 
newfound freedom whether they were material possessions or 
legal rights. Although the school now seems focused on 
the &quot;talented tenth&quot; approach,  Tuskegee Institute was 
founded to uphold Washington's teachings.
<P>In <I>The Future of the American Negro,</I> Washington  
states: &quot;An individual or a race that is strong enough, is 
wise enough, to disregard makeshifts, customs, prejudices, 
alluring temptations, deceptions, imitationsto throw off 
the mask of unreality and plant itself deep down in the clay, 
or on the solid granite of nature, is the individual or the 
race that will crawl up, struggle up, yes even burst up; and in 
the effort of doing so will gain strength that will command 
for it respect and recognition.&quot;
<P>Sadly, however, Washington's basic teachings on 
the dignity of hard work and earned respect have lost 
authenticity in modern America.  Being grateful for an 
opportunity, or the idea of  &quot;starting at the bottom and working to 
the top,&quot; has been supplanted.  In the process, too many 
people of all races have recklessly dismissed altogether the great principles of living espoused by Booker T. Washington.
<P>
<a name="3">
<P><B>The Washington Family Reunion</B>
<P> The Booker T. Washington reunion was attended 
by nearly 100 people.  The vast majority knew very little 
about their great ancestor's life, much less about his 
teachings. Almost none of Mr. Washington's descendants live 
either philosophically or geographically near the soil of 
Tuskegee. In fact, many of the descendants had for years concealed 
the fact that they were Washington's offspring.
<P>The widow of Booker T. Washington III, Joyce 
Washington, related to one group at the reunion how her husband, 
 Washington's own grandson, had been ashamed of 
his ancestry at times and had distanced himself 
geographically and emotionally.  &quot;Booker was not telling people in 
New York what his name was,&quot; she said.  &quot;He went through 
this whole story about what a difficult time he had with 
the name, and especially in New York City, where there are so many 
minorities.&quot;
<P>But, she says, later in life he began to see the value of his 
grandfather's teachings.  Similarly, many at the reunion seemed to realize for 
the first time the greatness of the man and his teaching.  Sarah Thrash is 
the great-granddaughter of Booker T. Washington; she attends church 
at the Allen Temple in Oakland, California, where several stained 
glass windows depict historic black figures including Frederick 
Douglass and Booker T. Washington. Though she was his 
direct descendent, Mrs. Thrash kept quiet about her relation 
to Washington.  But after the reunion weekend, she said 
she had gained a much greater appreciation for the man.  
&quot;It gives me a great sense of pride,&quot; she said. &quot;After 
this weekend, I'll feel so much more pride looking up at 
that window.&quot;

<P>
Throughout the Washington reunion weekend, Edith Washington, one of four living granddaughters of 
the Tuskegee legend, played the role of proud 
grandparent, great-grandparent, and great-great-grandparent.  At an 
introductory  gathering of the family outside Washington's home, 
The Oaks, at the edge of Tuskegee University, Edithwith microphone 
in handproudly introduced virtually all of the estimated 100 
attendants by name and explained their place in the family tree.
<P>When she got to one name, 26-year-old Douglass 
Washington Morris, she gushed about the recent Tuskegee graduate.  &quot;And 
back there is Douglass Washington Morris,&quot; she said, noting his 
amazing heritage: his great-grandfather is Booker T. Washington, while his 
great-great-grandfather on his other side is Frederick Douglass.
<P>&quot;Douglass is a consultant with IBM in Chicago,&quot; 
Edith boasted. &quot;He makes $100,000 a year.&quot;
<P>Everyone laughed at her grandmotherly candor; 
Mr. Morris seemed a bit embarrassed.
<P>
<a name="4">
<P><B>Education for What?</B>
<P>&quot;There are too many people in the world who give 
their whole lives grasping at the shadow instead of the 
substance&quot; wrote Booker T. Washington.
<P>Eleven out of the 13 great grandchildren at the Booker 
T. Washington reunion have achieved college degrees: 
surely their forefather would be proud, especially since most of 
them seem actually to be using their advanced educationthe 
very thing Mr. Washington called for.
<P>As the Washington family gathered at the old Oaks 
home on the grounds of Tuskegee University, Tuskegee 
president Benjamin Payton commended them for returning to 
their forefather's home.  He explained how difficult it has been to 
continue raising the money the university needed to 
keep growing and thriving.  He reiterated that Tuskegee's 
effort to carry on the Washington tradition remains strong.
<P>
Yet Payton never bothered to mention that the 
university now has no vocational offerings in its catalogue. 
What would the champion of dirt farmers and manual 
laborers have thought of that?  Would he be pleased or dismayed 
that none of the nearly 100 descendants at the reunion earn 
their living in a trade?  When asked whatever happened to 
the Washington emphasis on trade school training alongside 
traditional academic training, President Payton replied: &quot;We 
think that the education of the whole person is extraordinarily 
important.  We do it now at a different level.  What was being done 
in 1881 was to meet a need at that time.  There were so many 
African Americans that needed a knowledge of how to make 
the transition from agrarian to industrial [society]. . . .  We 
don't need a Tuskegee training blacksmiths now. . . .  We need 
blacks trained in electrical engineering, in aerospace 
engineering, and in health sciences. . . .  All these are contemporary 
expressions of providing an education that meets the needs of 
today's society . . . and not just what was going on in ancient 
Greece and Rome.&quot;
<P>
<a name="5">
<P><B>Work toward Usefulness</B>
<P>Later in the weekend, Edith sat with Washington's 
three other living granddaughters at a table of honor. The 
remaining family members sat at tables according to their 
age. Edith called for quiet and introduced Ethelda 
Murray Hockett, &quot;the oldest living descendent of Booker T. 
Washington,&quot; and the clan hushed to hear her memories of 
their family hero.
<P>Her uncle, she says, would love the pristine 
modern Tuskegee campus, built by early students who rotated 
three days of vocational training with three days of 
academic schooling.  &quot;He wanted students to use the knowledge 
they had and learn trades,&quot; she said, noting quietly: &quot;The 
trade building is gone now.&quot;
<P>&quot;It has been replaced by engineering,&quot; injected Edith, 
&quot;a higher step up.&quot;
<P>Throughout the weekend, Edith and other elders 
urged their youth to attend special college admittance 
sessions being offered by Tuskegee's recruitment staff.  The role 
and value of vocational training, however, was never discussed.
<P>Contended Agnes Louise Washington O'Neal, 
Edith's sister: &quot;[Washington] was a man of his times.  Times 
have changed.&quot;
<P>Have times changed?  Or has our understanding of 
what the times need changedand for the worse?
<P>Booker T. Washington foresaw two courses that all 
Americans, regardless of color, could take.  One esteems a 
person for his degree of  work; the other merely esteems the 
degree worked for.  &quot;I would say to the black boy what I would 
say to the white boy, `Get all the mental development your 
time and pocketbook will allow,'&quot; said Washington.
<P>The earnest desire to work toward usefulness inspired Booker T. Washington.  
Today he would surely applaud those in his family whose work ethic has led them to 
become doctors and lawyers; but he would surely give an 
equally rousing round of applause to those whose hard work 
ethic has led them to become master carpenters or masons.
<P>At one point during the Tuskegee reunion, several 
family members visited a bronze statue that depicts the &quot;Wizard 
of Tuskegee&quot; standing to lift a veil from a kneeling black 
man whose face looks skyward.
<P>The statue begs this question: what does the veil 
symbolize?  Does it represent an ignorance of &quot;higher 
knowledge&quot; that is being removed?  Or does it represent the removal 
of another sort of ignorance: the myth that human dignity 
is rooted purely in the vocation chosen, rather than in 
the excellence of work done in a chosen vocation?  &quot;Any 
man,&quot; said Mr. Washington, &quot;regardless of color, will be 
recognized and rewarded in proportion as he learns to do 
something well, learns to do it better than anyone else, 
however humble.&quot;
<P>Life, he taught, is the greatest classroom, and its 
graduates earn the highest degree.  &quot;The person who has 
mastered something, who understands what he is doing . . . out in 
the world, master of himself everywhere, that person,&quot; said 
Mr. Washington, &quot;is a scholar.&quot;
<P>
<BR>
<a name="6">
<B>Where Have All the Tradesmen Gone?</B><BR>
<P>
Washington understood what was at stake: &quot;We 
shall prosper as we learn to dignify and glorify common labour 
and put brains and skill into the common occupations of life; 
shall prosper in proportion as we learn to draw the line between 
the superficial and the substantial, the ornamental gewgaws 
of life and the useful.  No race can prosper until it learns that 
there is as much dignity in tilling a field as in writing a poem.&quot;
<P>And now, a hundred years later, corporate and 
small-town America is begging for tradesmen.  From bricklaying to 
tool-and-die work, the sort of high-skill, brain-and-brawn 
labor that Mr. Washington advocated is in rare supply but 
high demand.
<P>A recent Arthur Andersen Enterprise Group survey 
revealed that 25 percent of 919 small businesses surveyed 
fret over a dwindling supply of qualified workers in the 
trades. &quot;People have aimed for what was considered the most 
prestigious positions.  We don't have people for the other 
technologies,&quot; laments Julianne Inverso, student personal 
supervisor at Mercer County Vocational Technical Schools in 
Trenton, New Jersey.  At the Mercer County facility, students can 
be trained in air conditioning and refrigeration, auto body 
repair, business technology, computer operation, electrical 
construction, graphic arts, plumbing and heating, general 
building construction, and visual communicationsjust to name 
a few.  The student pool is diverse, from local teens learning 
a trade while attending  high school, to displaced members 
of the modern workplace.
<P>If holding a steady job and achieving a certain salary 
level are the measures, then Mercer's graduates may outdo 
those bound for college.  In 1995, Mercer County's facility 
graduated all of its 132 students. Only eight of 125 who 
later responded to a follow-up survey were unemployed, while 
86 had gone on to full- or part-time employment (some 
part-timers were attending college).
<P>While the historic reason for attending a university 
&quot;to learn to think&quot; has been supplanted by a utilitarian 
one, &quot;getting a job,&quot; growing numbers of today's students 
aren't even achieving that.
<P>The result is twofold.  First, the quality of education is 
 diminishing today: an Association for American 
Colleges survey reported that 78 percent of modern college 
graduates never take a Western history course; 77 percent avoid 
studying a foreign language; and 45 percent end-run even 
basic literature courses.  Second, less-learned college 
graduates leave school with their Holy Grail degree, only to find 
their cup empty as they are unable to find decent work.
<P>&quot;There is clearly a supply and demand problem for 
many manufacturers,&quot; says Michael Cantwell, national director 
of manufacturing at a management consulting firm, Grant Thorton, in a 
<I>Wall Street Journal </I>interview.
<P>The <I>Journal </I>article cites several examples of the paradox 
 in the American workforce: Lincoln Electric Company 
in Euclid, Ohio, currently has about 200 openings, with 
hourly pay ranging from $8.39 to $20.  While some openings are 
at the lowest rung of the plant, the company also needs 
tool-and-die makers, mold makers and machinists.
<P>But few of the thousands who apply for jobs at Lincoln 
can do high-school trigonometry or read technical drawings, 
and most don't show an aptitude for learning how to 
operate computer-controlled machines--skills that Lincoln says 
even entry-level workers need.
<P>Employees with certain skills are hot commodities.  
&quot;A journeyman welder is like a free agent in baseball,&quot; says 
Walt Elish, executive director of the Economic Development 
Corporation of Waukesha County, Wisconsin.  &quot;We can't 
find welders, we can't find tool-and-die makers, we can't 
find [computer-controlled] machine operators.&quot; He says 
such workers can earn from $35,000 to $50,000 a year, and it 
isn't uncommon for a good toolmaker to pull down $60,000 
with overtime.
<P>But to command those wages, today's factory 
workers need to use advanced math, have good communication 
skills and understand the use of computers.  Most 
high-school students with those abilities are college-bound.
<P>&quot;It is very frustrating,&quot; says Bruce Cable, Lincoln's 
employment manager, whose eight-person staff has 
screened thousands of candidates.  &quot;These days even if 
high-school students have C-minus grades, they can go to college.  
So, instead of getting the B student to handle a manual lathe, 
we are now getting the D student.&quot;
<P>Conservative columnist Don Feder has noted the 
same trend: &quot;Memo to incoming college freshmen: Most of you 
are wasting your parents' money, society's resources, and 
your own time.  The typical collegian would be better off at a 
trade school or in a job training program. . . .&quot;
<P>Feder quotes author William Henry III's 1994 book, 
<I>In Defense of Elitism</I>: &quot;For many adolescents . . . college 
is simply a holding pattern until they can get on with their 
lives. It is understandable that they should want to extend 
their youth and ponder their identities (or navels) for a bit; what 
is rather less clear is why they should do so at public as well 
as parental expense.&quot;
<P>Adds Feder: &quot;For most students, it's a cruel hoax; 
for families, an onerous burden to buy their progeny a 
paper credential.  For society, degree-worship is a huge and 
growing drain on the economy.
<P>&quot;And so, dear freshmen, heed those ads offering training 
in the operation of commercial vehicles or the art of dying 
hair and giving perms.  Compared to what you'll be doing for 
the next four years, this would be time well spent.&quot;

<CENTER><h2>New CRC Book Frees Seniors <br>Held Captive
by the Age Lobby</h2></CENTER>
<P>
 WASHINGTON -- Older Americans who join seniors advocacy groups
like the AARP are often attracted by insurance deals, credit card
offers and colorful publications.  But a new <B>Capital Research
Center</B> book entitled <U>Frightening America's Elderly:  How
the Age Lobby Holds Seniors Captive</U> shows seniors they are
really imprisoned by a rich and powerful lobby that promotes wasteful
government programs while taking tax dollars for itself.<BR>
<P>
 &quot;Establishment seniors groups have become as harmful and
counterproductive as the welfare state itself.  They have a vested
financial stake in maintaining the status quo, even if it leads
to the bankruptcy of programs that seniors depend on,&quot; writes
author and Loyola College of Maryland economist Thomas J. DiLorenzo.
 <BR>
<P>
 The American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) and dozens
of lesser-known organizations that make up the age lobby have
become expert at exploiting the fears and needs of the elderly
to build their own power.  This power comes courtesy of taxpayers.
 In 1993, the federal government gave AARP $86 million to show
seniors how to find jobs and do their taxes.  Yet a year later,
AARP itself had to pay the IRS $135 million in taxes and penalties
for a decade of business activities the government deemed unrelated
to its nonprofit mission.  AARP's 1994 earnings on the sale of
insurance, pharmaceuticals and auto-club services totaled $191
million.<BR>
<P>
 &quot;The reader will come away from this text knowing far more
than even most AARP members do about the nature of that organization,&quot;
writes preface author<B> Sen. Alan K. Simpson</B> (R-WY).  Simpson,
chairman of the Senate Finance Subcommittee on Social Security
and Family Policy, held hearings investigating the AARP's business
and lobbying practices.  &quot;As the possessor of a sizable stack
of chaotic, random and disorganized material about the AARP, I
commend Tom DiLorenzo and the Capital Research Center for condensing
this serpentine tale into a direct and comprehensible tract.&quot;
<BR>
<P>
 Recently, AARP and friends raised their taxpayer-funded voices
loud enough to drown out reports of the impending bankruptcy of
Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.  Trustees of these three
federal trust funds, on which most elderly rely, report that America's
aging population will empty the coffers faster than the smaller,
working-age population can re-fill them.  But the seniors lobby
falsely labeled efforts to save the system by slowing growth as
an attempt to &quot;cut&quot; benefits.<BR>
<P>
 &quot;These special interest lobbyists whose paychecks are tied
to failed welfare-state programs are stalling innovative reforms.
 <U>Frightening America's Elderly</U>  alerts members of these
groups that their support is contributing to the decline of the
American way of life,&quot; said Capital Research Center President
Terrence Scanlon.<BR>
<P>
 <U>Frightening America's Elderly:  How the Age Lobby Holds Seniors
Captive</U> explores the activities of the coalition of seniors
advocates that DiLorenzo calls the &quot;dependency lobby&quot;:
 AARP's unfair business practices; the National Council of Senior
Citizens' labor union ties; the Gray Panthers' socialist agenda;
and others.  It also heralds the more recent formation of a new
generation of seniors groups that emphasize voluntarism, consumer
choice and fiscal responsibility.
<P>

 To order <U>Frightening America's Elderly:  How the Age Lobby
Holds Seniors Captive</U>, send a check or money order for $15

<CENTER><h2>New Monthly <I>Culture Watch</I></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER>Is &quot;True Alternative Arts and Culture
Coverage&quot;</h2><BR></CENTER>
<P>
 WASHINGTON -- Capital Research Center in June begins publishing
<I>Culture Watch</I>, a new monthly newsletter which Editor
Laurence Jarvik calls &quot;true alternative arts and culture
coverage, highlighting those who have been sidelined by the shock
artists who have demoralized the intellectual community.&quot;
 <BR>
<P>
 &quot;We intend to raise the profile of those who defy the tide
of political correctness and stand up for the traditional values
of society,&quot; said Laurence Jarvik, Ph.D., Capital Research
Center cultural studies fellow and <I>Culture Watch</I> editor.
<BR>
<P>
 Every month, <I>Culture Watch</I><B> </B>will spotlight trends,
ideas and personalities that enrich the arts and cultural life.
 The June issue profiles Frederick Stocken, &quot;Britain's most
backward-looking composer.&quot;  Stocken is a musician dedicated
to classical musical ideals, despite the opposition of an avant-garde
power structure supported by public funds.<BR>
<P>
 &quot;The official guardians of the English music establishment
obviously were out of touch with their audience when they rejected
Stocken for his adherence to traditional standards -- a composer
who ultimately created a best-selling recording widely embraced
because of its harmonious melody,&quot; Jarvik said.<BR>
<P>
 Subsequent issues of <I>Culture Watch</I> will feature Maureen
Dowd, feisty <I>New York Times</I> columnist;  Professor Alan
Sokal, the NYU professor who discredited the field of cultural
studies by publishing an article challenging the law of gravity;
Mrs. Eugene Casey, who single-handedly donated $18 million to
give the Washington Opera a new home; and Will Fitzhugh, editor
of <I>The Concord Review</I>, a journal written by high school
students devoted to non-PC interpretations of American history.
 Trend stories will include an analysis of how Republicans are
portrayed in pop culture; and a look at the aftermath of Senator
Bob Dole's attack on Hollywood.<BR>
<P>
 &quot;America's moral standards have strayed so far from decency
that the artists who believe in the positive aesthetic value of
their work have been outcast by their colleagues.  <I>Culture
Watch</I> is a forum for these creators,&quot; said Capital Research
Center President Terrence Scanlon.<BR>
<P>
 <I>Culture Watch</I> will be Capital Research Center's fifth
monthly newsletter. It complements the institutional focus of<I>
Foundation Watch</I>, a newsletter that monitors the activities
of private foundations and analyzes their impact on American society.
 CRC launched <I>Foundation Watch</I>, also edited by Jarvik,
in February.<BR>
<P>
 CRC's other existing newsletters are <I>Organization Trends</I>,
which monitors advocacy organizations; <I>Alternatives in Philanthropy</I>,
which provides fresh perspectives on current trends and issues
in philanthropy; and <I>Philanthropy, Culture and Society</I>,
which examines the impact of philanthropy on American cultural
institutions and traditions.

<title>Michael Lind's Ad Hominem Attack On Conservative Foundations</title>

<center><h2>Michael Lind's Ad Hominem Attack On Conservative Foundations</h2></center>
<blockquote>
<center><h4>by Robert Huberty</h4></center>
<P>
<I>Up From Conservatism: Why the Right Is Wrong for America <I>
by Michael Lind (The Free Press, 1996, 295 pages, $23).
<p><br>
Michael Lind's hate letter to the conservative movement is a peculiar
production. It's a complex and sour brew of personal memoir and social
history, public policy analysis and political punditry. The author
deliberately aims to devalue
every intellectual and moral claim of Reagan-Gingrich conservatism.^M
 He is intent on revealing as counterfeit an inside-the-Beltway^M
Washington conservative establishment and the grantmaking foundations^M
that fund it.  Part expose and part bitter reflection, Lind proclaims^M
himself a one-time insider who has seen the belly of the beast.
<P>
Its title echoing William F. Buckley,^M
Jr.'s <I>Up From Liberalism</I>, Lind's book unfolds as an autobiographical^M
complaint.  As a young friend of Buckley's, Lind yearned to imitate^M
his mentor's feat of expelling someone from the conservative movement.^M
 But while Buckley won applause for criticizing Ayn Rand and the^M
John Birch Society, conservatives seemed not to care about Lind's^M
whistleblowing essays on what Pat Robertson believed about the^M
history of central banking, the Rothschilds and Karl Marx.  Conservatism^M
endent^Mement of combative writers and scholars had given way^M
to conservatism as a political movement, and theoretical and theological^M
differences among allies were downplayed for the sake of immediate^M
common ends in public policy.  The young writer was appalled.
<P>
Lind asserts that grantmaking foundations^M
have played the key role in orchestrating this development in^M
conservative opinion.  Through the power of the purse, he credits^M
them with an extraordinary capacity to advance careers, inhibit^M
dissent and shape public policies.  Like other conspiracy theorists^M
on the left and right, Lind sees interlocking directorates of^M
power in which orders are issued, tasks assigned, and projects^M
coordinated among favored writers and think-tanks.  [See the September^M
1996 issue of the radical <I>Z Magazine</I> which makes Capital^M
Research Center the center of a &quot;Meese/Simon axis.&quot;]^M
 Lind claims that conservative magazines and think-tanks are dep
on five conservative foundations: the John M. Olin Foundation,^M
Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation, J. Howard Pew Freedom Trust/Pew^M
Charitable Trusts, Smith-Richardson Foundation, and Sarah Scaife^M
Foundation.  But Pew has not been on anyone's list of conservative^M
funders in recent years while the others pursue more diverse and^M
fluctuating interests than he admits.
<P>
Lind construes the small number of^M
conservative grantmakers as evidence of a powerful conspiracy:^M
plutocratic pseudo-populists at work.  Of course, it's really^M
evidence of conservatism's weakness in the field of institutional^M
grantmaking and among foundation professionals.  Conservatives^M
are fortunate to have developed support from individual and foundation^M
donors.  And because they have lacked academic contacts, major^M
publishing outlets, and access to the national news media and^M
subsidized public broadcasting, conservatives have been entrepreneurial^M
in establishing their own think-tanks, newsletters and magazines,^M
creating direct mail and talk radio to get around the big media,^M
and securing footholds on the op-ed pages of major newspapers^M
through the excellence of their writing.  Lind mistakes initiative^M
for intrigue.  The liberal bias in major corporate giving to nonprofit^M
advocacy groups should be enough to undermine the claim that conservatives^M
are pampered mouthpieces of a corporate elite.
<P>
For someone with his intellectual ambitions,^M
Lind's writing can be incredibly snide and callow.  An advocate^M
of restricting legal immigration and an opponent of NAFTA, Lind^M
labels both Clinton Democrats and conservative Republicans as^M
members of the &quot;overclass.&quot;  He says both allow foreign^M
labor to dispossess white working class Americans and they do^M
it to justify their hired help:  &quot;Here, then, is a simple^M
test of overclass status.  Americans who do not have advanced^M
degrees and cannot afford maids or nannies are middle class; Americans^M
who have advanced degrees and can afford maids or nannies are^M
overclass.  It's as simple as that.&quot;  Lind's own opinions^M
are tinged with a nativist resentment and he insinuates that the^M
conservative movement is somehow alien.  He finds it peculiar^M
that so many conservative intellectuals have been Jews, Catholics^M
or foreign-born, and he disparages the major role &quot;foreigners^M
and immigrants&quot; like Rupert Murdoch play in funding journalists^M
of the right.
<P>
Because he covers so much political^M
and historical ground, <I>Up From Conservatism</I> could have^M
been an interesting book to argue with.  Lind believes conservatism^M
grew strong in the 80s because the culturally radical left destroyed^M
liberalism in the 60s and 70s.  An advocate of what he variously^M
calls &quot;national liberalism&quot; and &quot;neo-paleo-liberalism,&quot;^M
Lind argues that the modern Republican party is radical, not conservative,^M
and that its anti-tax, anti-regulation policies derive from a^M
&quot;Jefferson-Jackson populist liberalism.&quot;   Lind also^M
attacks the obsessive identity politics of the multi-culturalist^M
Left, and he faults New Democrats for promoting free trade and^M
entitlement reform instead of cultivating the FDR/LBJ legacy of^M
labor unions, social insurance and income redistribution, which^M
are the core of his own welfarist politics.  It is a mystery,^M
however, why this former Heritage Foundation fellow  should think^M
conservatives betrayed him by failing to honor these opinions.^M
 That sense of personal betrayal warps everything he has to say^M
about conservatism, and it gives his book its irate and even demented^M
tone.
<P>
Michael Lind is now a staff writer^M
at <I>The New Yorker</I> (edited by the British-born Tina Brown).^M
 HarperCollins (owned by Rupert Murdoch) has just published his^M
first novel, <I>Powertown</I>, a  depiction of greedy, conniving,^M
degraded residents of Washington, D.C.  which helps explain why^M
he might have written <I>Up From Conservatism. </I>The first reviews^M
of the novel should help Lind decide whether his new colleagues^M
in the New York literary world are more fair-minded and generous^M
than the conservatives he thinks let him down.<BR>^M

<title>Hocking the Halo:  Are America's Charities for Sale?</title>
</head>

<center><h2>Hocking the Halo:  Are America's Charities for Sale?</h2></center>
<blockquote>
<center><h4>by Thomas DiLorenzo<BR>
(As seen in The Washington Times on August 17, 1996)
</h4></center>
<P>
<DD>	Small business is raising hell as it discovers that some of America's largest nonprofit charities unfairly earn millions of dollars by "hocking their halos."<BR>
<DD>	The American Cancer Society, American Heart Association, American Lung Association, Arthritis Foundation and others are entering the business world and setting up operations that sell everything from vacation packages to mutual funds.  
Small businesses complain they can't match the deals offered by their tax-exempt business rivals.  They say such practices are "unfair competition."  Some businesses even accuse charities of "ripping off" their products and customers and trading on the charity's good reputation.<BR>
<DD>	A recent news story described how small businesses that sell turbans, hats, scarves and prostheses to female cancer patients have attacked the American Cancer Society (ACS) for distributing a new, mail-order catalogue peddling the same products they sell for a living.  The catalogue sales undercut small business in two ways:  ACS's tax-exempt status allows it to offer the products at a lower price, and its charitable status gives the products an perceived seal of approval.  The ACS is "using its vast reservoir of goodwill and trust to sell products," complains Peggy Childs, proprietor of Designs for Comfort, a Chicago business that is forced to compete with ACS products.<BR>
<DD>	The American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) is the most notorious example of a non-profit organization that uses its good name to sell hundreds of millions of dollars of products annually.  AARP sells insurance policies, mutual funds, mail-order pharmaceuticals, auto rental s, auto club memberships, Visa and Mastercard credit cards, and hotel discount packages.  Companies like Scudder Financial Services, Prudential Insurance, American Express, New York Life, JTT Hartford, Amoco, and Bank One provide the products and services.  Then they pay AARP a percentage of their sales in return for the use of the charity's name and reputation.<BR>
<DD>	AARP pays taxes on ad revenue from its Modern Maturity magazine and on income from its money market funds and credit cards.  But its pharmacy, auto club and insurance profits are not taxed, prompting the charges of  "unfair competition."  Business has a good point:  Why should AARP be exempt from taxes when virtually identical companies not affiliated with the non-profit giant must pay taxes to provide the same services?  <BR>
<DD>	Senator Alan Simpson (R-WY) aptly summarized this conflict at a 1995 Senate hearing.  It is as if "U.S. Steel decided to rename itself the 'American Association of Steel Enthusiasts,' offered some discounts and rebates to millions of Americans in exchange for a strictly nominal contribution, and then used that incidental association to gain tax-exempt status."<BR>
<DD>	There is evidence, moreover, that AARP members relying on the group's good reputation are buying inferior products. For instance:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>	Last year, Money magazine evaluated AARP's businesses and concluded that of AARP's ten types of insurance, only its supplemental Medicare insurance deserved high marks; the rest were rated "decent to dreadful."  
<LI>	In 1994, 25 mutual funds did better than AARP's best performer, its Growth and Income fund.
<LI>	And in 1983, 500 San Diego AARP members purchased cellular phones for $209 each from a firm that promised to pay AARP $5 for each phone sold to a member.  But the company went bankrupt, the members did not receive their phones or a refund, and AARP -- with $358 million in revenues that year -- refused to reimburse them, saying it "couldn't afford" the cost.<P>
<BR>
<DD>	Other charities are jumping on the commercial bandwagon.  The American Heart Association sold its "Heart Check Seal of Approval" for $550,000 to the Florida citrus industry.  (Earlier, it abandoned its "HeartGuide Seal" program after the FDA warned the public that some of its claims might be "illegal" and "unproven.")  The American Lung Association endorses home carbon monoxide testing kits for a fee.  The Arthritis Foundation has endorsed Johnson and Johnson products in return for $1 million in annual donations.  And the Skin Cancer Foundation's "Seal of Recommendation" is for sale for $100,000 per year.<BR>
<DD>	The commercialization of non-profit activities is a disturbing trend, because it squanders the organization's most valuable asset, the public's trust.  In the long run, the nonprofit sector is jeopardized.  The mere perception that a charity is hocking its halo -- its good name -- for profit will scare donors away.  They won't contribute to a charity that prefers to sell its services instead.

Traditionally, newspapers have shied away from developing close relationships with the foundation world. Because newspapers and television have long ago taken  the position that outside money is tainted, they'd sooner turn to advertisers for revenues -- even advertisers they don't like -- than apply for a grant.The code of ethics of Sigma Delta Chi (the journalists' professional organization) prohibits accepting "any thing of value" in exchange for covering a story. But lately things have changed. On June 20, 1996 the Pew Charitable Trusts announced grants of  $4.3 million over the next three years to the Pew Center for Civic Journalism in Washington, D.C. as one component of an enterprise called "Renewing Our Democratic Heart."
Pew is composed of  seven named charitable trusts with different missions, established from 1948 to 1979. One hundred fifteen employees give out $180 million each year, making Pew the nation's third largest foundation. Pew is currently footing the bill for 34 media projects nationwide as part of a movement known as civic journalism (the movement is more commonly called public or community journalism depending on which group is pushing it). Although the names are different, the purpose is the same. However, civic journalism  remains controversial among editors such as Howell Raines of the New York Times and Leonard Downie of the Washington Post chary about outsiders influencing their editorial decisions. Smaller papers seem to have fewer hesitations about taking Pew's money.
And so Pew, with no previous track record in journalism, has suddenly emerged as a major player in the news business. Foundation president Rebecca Rimel proudly declares that thanks to her multi-million dollar expenditure, civic journalism "is becoming the way to do business in many newsrooms across the country." This is happening, in large part, because Pew is paying newspapers, and radio and television stations to cover stories in the way it wants to see them covered.
Pew's $4.3 million commitment is only the most recent development in Pew's onging love affair with the media. Since fall 1993, the foundation has pledged at least $19.7 million to various media enterprises, $10.7 million of it to support civic journalism. In some cases, Pew provides lump sums to newspapers and broadcast outlets so they can conduct opinion polls and convene focus groups. Pew pays newspapers to send reporters out of town and even to rent apartments for reporters to live in selected neighborhoods. The overarching goal of these activities is to use the "extradordinary power" of the media to stimulate the public "to participate in community life," as Rimel puts it. "Civic journalism is one way to engage people in seeking solutions to their local problems."

<h3>THE PEW MEDIA MONOPOLY</h3>
<p>
The Philadelphia-based Pew 
		Charitable Trusts established a 
		Washington, D.C. beachhead for its Pew Center for Civic Journalism in September 1993. The Center's staff of three is run by Walter Cronkite's former CBS News producer, Edward Fouhy. The Center distributes money to news organizations, holds seminars around the country and spreads the gospel of civic journalism to newsrooms across the land [see grants list box on page 4]. Last year, Pew gave Ed Fouhy's group an additional $300,000 over three years to "raise the visibility and stature of civic journalism through an awards and symposium program."
	This spring,  the Pew Center for Civic Journalism awarded prizes of  $25,000 to three newspapers _ The Charlotte Observer, The Kansas City Star and The Argus Leader in South Dakota _ for: "Doing journalism in a manner calculated to re-engage people in the process of public life."  While significantly smaller than a MacArthur "genius" award, the  $25,000 sum is among the more lucrative in the field.
	And when The Times-Mirror Company announced last year it would be forced to shutter its well-respected  Center for the People and Press, Pew donated money to keep the Washington-based polling organization open for three more years, and asked that it be called the Pew Research Center.
 	Pew is bankrolling former Washington Post reporter Paul Taylor's efforts to the tune of $111,864 for a six-month consulting contract, which includes salary, travel expenses and setting up conferences, to convince television networks to give free air time to presidential candidates. Taylor teamed up with Fouhy's old partner, former CBS anchor Walter Cronkite. Together they have successfully convinced Rupert Murdoch's Fox Television network to provide one hour of free airtime this fall. However, while candidate Bob Dole has agreed to participate,  President Clinton has not yet accepted.
       	Both through its Washington Center and directly, the Pew Charitable Trusts have contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Radio-Television News Directors Foundation for community journalism projects, to the Citizens Election Project and National Public Radio and to Soundprint Media Center for online civic journalism through the World Wide Web. Pew has provided $3.2 million over three years for the National Arts Journalism program at the University of Georgia, as well. And, as devotees of National Public Radio hear over and over, the Pew Charitable Trusts sponsor the radio network's reporting on culture, the environment and religion. 
	Once a relatively obscure charity, Pew is sending shoots and tendrils everywhere in the world of journalism. "You mean the Pew media monopoly," jokes John Dinges, NPR editorial director. "It's an interesting experiment by a foundation to get into the world of media with some definite ideas for innovation and change."

<a name="Rimel"></a>
<h3>THE RIMEL REVOLUTION</h3>
<p>
Why are the Pew Charitable Trusts so interested in this new and controversial civic journalism movement? The answer lies more with president Rebecca Rimel  than with the nine trustees who ultimately decide how to spend Pew's millions. Rimel, aged 45, is a former emergency room nurse and assistant professor of neurology at the University of Virginia, who has done much to change the direction of a foundation once known for its low profile and conservative leanings. 
	Rimel joined the Philadelphia-based Pew foundation in 1983 as manager of its health program and quickly rose as former Pew president Thomas Langfitt's protege (he is an eminent neurosurgeon) to become vice president, then president in July 1988.  Today she earns $318,213 a year. After an administrative shake-up in which nearly two-thirds of  Pew's permanent staff departed Rimel has concentrated Pew's giving in six major program areas:  culture, education, health and human services, religion, public policy _ and an interdisciplinary grab-bag including the Children's Television Workshop's production of Ghostwriter for PBS, the Center for Community Change's anti-poverty initiatives, the Global Action Plan for the Earth, Inc. and San Francisco's Tides Foundation for the Global Stewardship Initiative. Rimel favors working in partnerships with other foundations, something Pew rarely did before.
	The Pews were an old Philadelphia family whose fortunes derived from the Sun Oil Co. (now Sunoco). Joseph N. and Mary Anderson Pew had four children who set up seven separate trusts between 1948 and 1979 which are jointly administered as the Pew Charitable Trusts. Together they became a major charity, generously handing out money _ mostly to local  Philadelphia organizations which helped the neediest. They didn't call press conferences. The Pew style was to quietly, often anonymously, dole out their largess. Until 1987, there was no listing for the Pew Charitable Trusts in the Philadelphia telephone directory. This was due to a "a very deep religious conviction that one does not need recognition for their good deeds," says Rimel. 
	 It was J. Howard Pew who built the family business into a global enterprise. And he left the strongest imprint on the family trusts created in 1957 to further the free enterprise system. Under his direction, it supported such causes as open markets, lower taxes and less government regulation.When J. Howard Pew died in 1971, the philanthropy began to evolve, while it remained committed to giving in Philadelphia. The board decided in the late 1980s  that  it would seek national attention. Part of that push came from Rimel. 
	"It had been a bit of a mom and pop operation," says Rimel. "We had grown up slowly. We had a very small staff. The board gave me the directive that we want this to be a national foundation with a  local commitment." With assets of $3.8 billion, the trusts give 20 to 30 percent of their annual contributions to Philadelphia arts and human service groups. Pew also supports population control efforts and contributes to national and international organizations organizations to help meet health needs of at-risk women and children. "I guess if you had to put a tag on us," Rimel says, "we are really trying to help a lot of the organizations and institutions we work with recapture the middle ground."
       But a middle of the road approach is not what some observers see. "I call them liberal, " says Althea K. Nagai, a political scientist who has done statistical grant analyses of the Pew foundation.  "Rimel herself is not a conservative. In one piece about her, she says she was a sixties liberal and wanted to recall the spirit of the times. She says she wanted to bring that kind of spirit to the Pew. But looking at the J. Howard Pew charter, you can see that J. Howard was very much against what we would call today traditional liberalism. He was very conservative."  [see Alternatives in Philanthropy, "The Pew Charitable Trusts: Revitalizing 'the spirit of the 60s,'" November, 1995]
	But today Pew has a full-time director of communications. Its offices are housed on two floors of a swank high-rise office building at 2005 Market Street in Philadelphia's financial district. Each year, Pew receives between 5,000 and 6,000 proposals but generally awards only 500 grants, a ratio of one in ten. In 1995, Pew gave 33 grants of $1 million or over. The majority of the grants _ 35 percent _ were in the $200,000 to $499,999 range. Sixty-seven percent of the grants were distributed nationally, while 24 percent were targeted for Philadelphia-based groups and 9 percent were given to international organizations. 
	The Pew board meets in March, June, September and December to review grant proposals, which generally take up to six months to consider before a decision is made.	
       Six program officers gave $162 million in 1995 in the areas of culture (52 grants), education (43 grants), environment (58 grants), religion (26 grants), public policy (12 grants), health and human services (109 grants) and interdisciplinary (74 grants).
       *Marian A. Godfrey is director of the culture program, which supports working artists and says she wants to strengthen the role of arts and culture in Philadelphia and across the country. Pew is the home base for the Council on Foundation's "Grantmakers in the Arts" affinity group, which has championed  "arts advocacy" and funded many  groups supporting the National Endowment for the Arts in its conflicts with Congress over the use of federal funds for profanity, obscenity, blasphemy and anti-American propaganda.
	*Robert B. Schwartz is director of the education program, which funds elementary and high school education. Pew's emphasis on public school reform does not include support for vouchers, which would enable poor parents to enjoy the same freedom of choice already available to the affluent. 
	*Joshua S. Reichert is director of the environment program, which is interested in global warming, global climate change and global pollution prevention rather than challenging doomsday prophets in the manner of Dr. Julian Simon. 
	*Tamar R. Datan is program officer for the Interdisciplinary Fund, which gives money to the Pew Center for Civic Journalism and last year gave $600,000 to the Academy of Teleivsion Arts and Sciences Foundation for a two-year project to educate and train television writers about the negative effects of gratuitous TV violence, a public relations campaign along the lines of the Joyce Foundation's anti-gun efforts [for a parallel case, see vol.1 no.6, "How Does The Joyce Foundation Deal With Dissent? 'Squash It!'"].
	*Paul C. Light is director of Pew's Public Policy program, whose 1995 goals included promoting economic and political freedom abroad. Over the past six years, Pew has spent nearly $40 million in this program area giving more than 100 grants to promote democracy and market reforms in Eastern and Central Europe. 
	*Joel A. Carpenter is director of religion, a program which offers scholarships and has programs designed to make community ministries and religious leaders more effective.

<h3>USING JOURNALISM AS A TOOL</h3>
<p>
One of the ways to improve civic democracy in America, Rimel believes,  is through what Pew calls civic journalism. Rimel doesn't pretend to be a media junkie. She's a self-avowed techno-peasant who grew up on a farm, and admits she'd be lost on the Internet. Pew recently started up a home page (http://www.pew-trusts.org) that Rimel will have to learn to surf. But she believes the press can be a vehicle for reaching out to citizens and getting them to care about their government and community. Rimel is careful to point out that Pew is not interested in running a newspaper or reforming or reviving a failing newspaper. It is interested in supporting "civic journalism experiments."
	Civic journalism is a theory developed by some academics and old-hand journalists such as David Broder who worry about the future of journalism and what they claim to be its growing negative effect on democracy. Some well-known figures such as Carter speechwriter and Clinton appointee James Fallows say the press' growing cyncism has infected their work and therefore poisoned how Americans view the political process.
	"Our foray into civic journalism is really via the back door," Rimel says. "I've never had any particular interest _ didn't see it as our role, still don't _ how journalism goes about its business. Except we do see it as an issue if journalism can be used as a tool, as a way to get the public reconnected, reinvigorated, recommitted to democratic values," she says. "Increasingly, we understand the power of the press. They  are extraordinarily powerful in shaping opinions and giving people information," she explains. 
	"Given that power, any way that the press might play a role in any kind of experiment in journalism to provide that information in a more effective,  efficient, user-friendly way appeals to us," Rimel says. Rimel first heard about civic journalism from former Knight-Ridder chairman  James K. Batten. As head of the country's second-largest newspaper chain, Batten (who died last year) had already pushed public journalism at some of his 32 newspapers, including the Charlotte Observer, which covered the 1992 elections as a major public journalism project.
	Batten met Rimel in January 1993 when he came to Pew seeking money to help rebuild Miami houses destroyed by Hurricane Andrew.  The subject changed into the depressing topic of how alienated American citizens were becoming from their community, their government and each other. Both were eager to find ways to get citizens more deeply involved in the democratic process. By September 1993, Pew had given television journalist Edward M. Fouhy $3.6 million to open the Pew Center for Civic Journalism in Washington, D.C.
<p>
<a name="Tides"></a>
<h3>PEW'S WASHINGTON CENTER:  ADMINISTERED BY TIDES</h3>
<p>
Federal law prohibits foundations from donating money to for-profit organizations, such as newspapers.  That's why the Pew Charitable Trusts makes its donations to the Tides Foundation, which in turn funds the Pew Center,which pays the newspapers. Tides handles all the Center's paperwork and medical benefits as well as adminstering the grant from one Pew entity to another. On March 15, 1996 the Tides Foundation staff distributed a memorandum to its board of directors denouncing the "disastrous 1994 elections" and "the urgent need for progressives to reverse the gains made by the radical right."
	On the other hand the Center's Washington director, Edward Fouhy, has solid establishment credentials. Fouhy, 61, had been CBS's Saigon bureau chief during the Vietnam war, personally ran both the CBS News and ABC News Washington bureaus.When Batten spoke glowingly of  Fouhy, Rimel sought out the TV veteran in an effort to focus amorphous talk about the media's role in "reconnecting" citizens into a plan for action. 
	Rimel had been prepared to woo Fouhy with flowers and chocolates. But it wasn't necessary. Fouhy says that he had become disgusted with how turned off the public was to the political process. He told Rimel that he thought the press held some responsibility for that.
	Pew "asked me if I could think of a strategy to deal with this growing sense of alienation which they had already sensed," Fouhy says. "It became pretty obvious that if you were going to do the kind of outreach that I recommended in a strategy paper, that you have to have some kind of base." The Pew Center for Civic Journalism was set up to underwrite media partnerships based on Fouhy's strategic recommendation that it was crucial for money be given to television, radio and newspaper partnerships, since that each medium has a particular strength which could be exploited together.   Typically, television and newspapers or radio rarely share information. But Pew-backed media partners are doing just that, co-operating rather than competing in their news coverage.
	 To help this along, Pew gave $600,000 to the Radio-Television News Directors' Foundation to foster partnerships between electronic and print media. "We have some money that we can give $5,000, $10,000, $15,000 out to projects for focus groups, surveys or town meetings,"  says Eric Swanson, director of the Radio-Television Directors' Foundation,  "Whereas the Pew Center for Civic Journalism has more money and can give out $50,000 to $100,000 grants." Swanson's foundation funded five partnerships in 1995.  "Other than the price tag, we are both up to the same goal which is to get enhanced or greater coverage of issues of concern in communities by structuring partnerships between radio, television and print. The typical makeup has been a partnership with a leading daily, a local commercial TV outlet and local radio _ typically it's public radio."
	Pew gave National Public Radio $290,000 directly for its Voter Project in which five public radio stations, tried to cover the 1994 elections in ways that would stimulate citizen interest. Pew gave the project another $250,000 for 1996. To improve election coverage, the Pew Center gave $835,000 to the 1996 Citizen's Election Project, which is run by Stan Cloud, former Time magazine Washington bureau chief. "To me the interesting thing is Pew has set up an election and civic journalism part of their operation  and they distribute their money in lots of different chunks which are kind of all operating independently," says John Dinges, NPR editorial director.  
	Sometimes too independently, it seems. This has led some to question whether Pew is properly overseeing the use of its money. Take for example, overlap between the NPR election project and Cloud's Citizens Election Project. "The strange thing is that the Citizens Election Project funded a number of my stations independent of the NPR Election Project,"says NPR's Dinges.  "I did the election project in 1994 for the '94 election. During 1995, Stan Cloud came in and funded a number of projects for the same partnerships that I set up the previous year. They did Boston, San Francisco, Seattle. All of which I had set up. Stan's projects were for early '96 to focus on the primaries. But my project continues through the election."
	A good example of duplication, says Dinges, is the Voters' Voice project with New Hampshire public radio and a statewide coalition of the Associated Press.  "We weren't able to give them as much money as Stan did," says Dinges. "It turned out it was not a very well coordinated project. Stan came in in the middle, did his thing and most of the time it worked out all right. But it could have been better. The question I would pursue is the separate funding operations. Pew could have made sure they were coordinated. If Ed Fouhy had run the whole thing it probably would have been smoother."

<h3>OUTSIDE THE BELTWAY</h3>
<p>
One of the tenets of public journalism is that reporters need to learn what people are really thinking about. The view among Washington journalists last fall was that the Republican primary would revolve around which candidate was best qualified to help House Speaker Newt Gingrich advance his "Contract with America,"  says Don MacGillis, who coordinated the Boston Globe's Pew-funded civic journalism election project, "People's Voice."  It was Washington wisdom that people outside the Beltway were eager to have the federal budget balanced and taxes cut.
	"The goals of our project were to find out if these really were the issues of concern to New Hampshire voters and then, whatever those concerns turned out to be, to get the candidates to address them," says MacGillis, who spoke at a Pew Center symposium in Washington, D.C. this spring.  Through Pew-funded polling and focus groups and getting to know the people of Derry, N.H. participants learned  residents feared  losing their jobs (even though the state has an extremely low unemployment rate). MacGillis felt vindicated when a surprised, somewhat befuddled Bob Dole announced: "I didn't realize that jobs and trade and what makes America work would become a big issue in the last days of this campaign." 
	A bemused MacGillis told guests at the Pew symposium: "If Dole had been reading the People's Voice articles or listening to the radio and TV programs of our partners, he would have known way back in the fall of 1995 that economic insecurity was a major concern, probably the major concern of New Hampshire voters." Of course, Pat Buchanan's campaign efforts helped draw attention to the pocketbook issue without Pew's subsidy.
	Pew's hope is to find a way to re-connect citizens to the election process by encouraging them to participate in candidate forums and advocating that people _ who often are too apathetic to vote _ go to the polls. The point of civic journalism, say those who practice it, is to take back control of election dialogues from political handlers and candidates.
<p>
<a name="Nobody"></a>
<h3>WHAT IF THEY GAVE A FORUM AND NOBODY CAME?</h3>
<p>
Sounds noble. But what if the candidates just don't want to listen or participate in a civic journalism experiment?  It happened to Dave Iverson,  executive producer for "Citizens '96" sponsored by the Pew-supported Voice of the People Iowa Coalition for Wisconsin Public TV, the Wisconsin State Journal in Madison, six different Iowa newspapers, the Iowa AP, Iowa Public Television, Iowa Public Radio and two commercial TV stations. 
	Their goal was to gather an audience to question the nine presidential candidates in a debate before the Iowa caucuses. About 300 Iowans were primed to ask questions. "Just one problem," says Iverson, "the candidates. Now for months we had done the candidate dance. They were in. They were out. They were in. They were out. They told us every possible version of, this looks good, without ever getting final commitments." 
	On the eve of the broadcast, Iverson had promises from five candidates. Steve Forbes, Pat Buchanan and Lamar Alexander agreed to participate if Bob Dole appeared.  "About 24 hours before the debate itself, Dole made his final decision _ he had been back and forth about it _ and said he wouldn't do it," Iverson says. "Alexander, Buchanan and Forbes who had all made those "this looks good" noises then backed out." Then Phil Gramm pulled out. Then Dick Lugar withdrew. 
	"So we were left with -- and I bet you remember this trio -- Alan Keyes, Bob Dornan and yes, Morry Taylor," says Iverson. "It wasn't a pretty prospect." Six hours before the broadcast, Lugar decided he'd made a promise to the people of Iowa and he'd come. One of the lessons Iverson shared at the civic journalism symposium in Washington, D.C. was that "no matter how sophisticated a media consortium you build, candidates will still act like candidates and make their own strategic decisions."
<p>
<a name="Threats"></a>
<h3>THREATS TO INDEPENDENCE AND INTEGRITY</h3>
<p>
Pew is undeterred by failures such as Iverson's Wisconsin debate. It is similarly resistant to criticism from skeptics such as Washington Post editor Leonard Downie, former New York Times executive editor Max Frankel, columnist Maureen Dowd [see "Why is New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd driving the White House crazy?" in Culture Watch, vol.1, no. 2] or editorial page editor Howell Raines. 
	Frankel told this reporter he has read much of the literature on public journalism and still doesn't get it.  "Some of it sounds like old fashioned reporting," says Frankel, "some of it sounds like getting in bed with the promotion department and that's unfortunate. Some of it sounds downright political."
	However, increasing numbers of journalists seem, in Fouhy's words, to "get it," which often gives critics the impression that public or civic journalism is some kind of growing religious-like movement.  It is difficult for some outsiders to grasp because there are few texts and no specific guidelines or concrete definitions of exactly what is a civic journalism project. 
	Some newspaper veterans are uncomfortable with sponsoring events that they have traditionally covered. Nonetheless, newspaper-radio-television partnerships are lining up with their hands extended for Pew Center grants. To date, the Pew Center has doled out $575,000 to 17 newspaper-radio-television partnerships for community-oriented projects in 1996. This year it will also co-sponsor four seminars on civic journalism in locations around the country.
	"The first year was all criticism," says Jan Schaffer, the Pew Center's deputy director and a former Philadelphia Inquirer business editor. "The second year there was a lot of curiosity and people trying it. The third year is, "How exactly do I do this?"  Over the past three years, the Pew Center has provided money for 34 projects in 24 cities involving partnerships among newspapers, television and radio outlets. Recipients include 22 newspapers, 24 television stations and 20 radio stations. Pew grants pay for items that would normally be outside a newsroom's normal operating budget. It is not to be used to buy newsprint or cover a reporter's salary.
	Moreover, the money comes with strings. It may only  be used for such items as polling, an expense many news outlets say they can no longer afford. The pressure for high profits, particularly at corporately-owned newspapers, has forced many newsroom managers to slash budgets to raise revenue. So Pew money fills in the gaps. Pew money is also used to hold town meetings, conduct focus groups to learn what people are thinking about _ and sometimes Pew  pays for the salary of a "newsroom coordinator," who sets up town meetings and functions much like a community organizer.
	This year's Pew grants range in size form $5,000 to $61,000. While large foundations such as Ford, Robert Wood Johnson, Knight and Kaiser have given money to the press, it is often used for seminars, press education or for fellowships to individual reporters. It is rarely given directly to newspapers or commercial electronic outlets. For example, Harvard's Nieman fellowships are given to reporters, not to the newspaper. They are stipends which replace salaries while reporters conduct their studies.
	These sorts of grants can generate controversy themselves. Two years ago a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation grant to NBC for a two-hour televised discussion on health reform aroused criticism from other members of the media _ even though that foundation, like the Pew trusts, claimed it had exercised no editorial control. "For foundations to give grants to commercial newspapers to carry out tasks or information gathering would be very unusual," says Waldemar Nielsen, a noted author on the activities of foundations and columnist for the Chronicle of Philanthropy. 
	A thirteen-member advisory board, made up mostly of journalists (many of them Fouhy's friends), decides how Pew's money should be spent. Money goes only to media partnerships _ as opposed to a single news outlet _ for projects that carry out a civic journalism project. The goal is to reach consensus about a problem and its solution.  Funds cannot  be used merely for research. Eligible  media projects might focus on education, transportation or neighborhood safety. Members of the Pew Center for Civic Journalism advisory board, made up largely of journalists, approve the topics. "I don't have any relationship with the Pew Board," says Fouhy. "If they walked in the door, I wouldn't recognize them. I've never met them. They don't know who we fund until we let them know. Independence is one of the tenets of this whole thing. We wouldn't be here if we didn't have that independence."
	Pew grantmakers hope their money will be used to start an experiment  which media outlets will continue. "A lot of papers are going to be increasingly saying:  'We ought not to take money,' " says University of Maryland journalism professor Hodding Carter III, a member of the advisory board. "Pew is not in the business of subsidizing newspapers. We are in the business of encouraging the idea" of civic journalism.
	But Roberto Suro, deputy national editor of the Washington Post,  has taken the role of resident skeptic on the Pew advisory board. Suro is concerned about the threats to the independence and integrity of reporters dependent upon Pew-funded coordinators. 
	For example, Charlene Price-Patterson handled logistics for public journalism events sponsored by the Charlotte Observer, WSOC-TV and two radio stations. Price-Patterson only worked temporarily at the paper.  She is not a reporter but a community activist. Although technically she did not work for Pew, her Observer salary did not go towards traditional news-gathering activities. Price-Patterson arranged child care, refreshments and transportation and spent some time "knocking on doors to publicize the event," she wrote in the Pew Center's newsletter.

<h3>"WE MAKE PLENTY OF MONEY"</h3>
<p>
Some journalists by nature prefer to think of themselves as lone cowboys who have the skills to go in and rope their own cattle. They don't need to hire someone else to do the job, many would say. "If I was a newspaper editor," says Suro, "I would not feel comfortable having someone in that position and particularly not in the newsroom." Price-Patterson's desk was located in the newsroom.
	Jim Walser coordinated the Observer's "Taking Back Our Neighborhoods" project which won last year's $25,000 James K. Batten  award. He says some reporters did feel uneasy about having a coordinator in the newsroom. "But from the standpoint of the editors, it worked well," he adds. "Charlene wasn't putting stories in the newspaper. She was giving us information. She knew a hell of a lot more people in the neighborhoods than any of our neighborhood reporters."
	Last year, former Philadelphia Inquirer associate editor Fran Dauth was in the market for a new job. One of the many newspapers that was interested in hiring her was the San Francisco Chronicle. In talking with Chronicle managing editor Dan Rosenheim, she asked if his paper had taken any Pew money. He told her it had for an election project. Dauth questioned why the Chronicle didn't use its own money to pay for reporting. Rosenheim cited budget constraints, although the paper was making a profit.
	"I don't know any particular evil about taking money from Pew," Dauth says.  Now an editor with New Jersey's Newark Star Ledger, she adds, "But it seems to go against the training of what we do. The newspapers are taking money from an outside source. The outside source says, "You can have this money if you do this kind of story." It also seems to me once you become dependent on an outside source to finance the project, you give up independence."
	Witness the Philadelphia Inquirer, a prestigious Knight-Ridder newspaper with a slew of Pulitzer prizes. Last year, the Inquirer found itself at the center of a media flap when it hired urban expert Neil Peirce for an editorial board project on regionalism. The Inquirer paid for the project. But Peirce had received money for expenses indirectly from the New Era Foundation. When the Wall Street Journal reported New Era was an elaborate Ponzi scheme which had ensnared dozens of charities, the Inquirer was tarred.  
	Ironically, the Inquirer had earlier applied to the Pew Center for Civic Journalism, but had been turned down. However, the paper was invited to resubmit its application after making a few changes. 
	But Inquirer Editor Maxwell E. P. King says the paper has since decided it should not take foundation money and did not reapply.  "At this point," says King, "I'd be very, very reluctant to take any funding from any foundation for a journalism project because I'd worry whether that would impinge on the independence of the newspaper. Besides, we make plenty of money. We can fund our own journalism."

<h3>MONEY AS GUILT, PHILANTHROPY AS THERAPY, AND THE LEGACY OF WEALTH</h3>
<p>
<I>by Robert Huberty</I>
<p>
	<I>The Legacy of Inherited Wealth: Interviews With Heirs</I>, edited by Barbara Blouin with Katherine Gibson and Margaret Kiersted (Trio Press, 1995, paperback, 185 pages, $14.95.  Available from The Inheritance Project, Inc., 3291 Deer Run Rd., Blacksburg, VA 24060, 540/552-8436.<P>

	Karl Marx thought capitalism would make workers so miserable and angry that they would develop a class consciousness, rise up in revolution, and overthrow their oppressors.  Marx's social theory, which disastrously misled politicians and intellectuals for a century, failed in a number of ways.  It did not forsee the astonishing productivity of the free market.  It cannot account for the enormous middle class of producers and consumers that Western society has created.  Finally, it did not anticipate that successful capitalists would apparently make their own children so miserable and angry that they would throw away their opportunities, seek therapy, and they (not the workers) would use their inherited wealth to create the collectivist society Marx wanted. 
	The editors of this volume have identified such people.  The children of the very rich are much envied but little studied. Unlike most citizens in a modern competitive marketplace, they are not compelled to make enough money to acquire goods.  Like the poor, they have been left out of our wealth-producing system.  But while the problems of poor people occasion much public policy debate, no one pays much attention to those who inherit so much money that working is purely a matter of personal choice.  The editors, themselves heirs and founders in 1992 of a group called The Inheritance Project, Inc., have remedied this neglect by interviewing seventeen adult heirs.  The Legacy of Inherited Wealth records their stories.  In their own words, they tell us what it's like to grow up rich. 
	Now for those of  us who didn't grow up rich, it is tempting to report gleefully that most heirs, as recorded in these narratives, seem pathetically unhappy.  Gifted novelists of manners have written many stories about lives like theirs, often with comic irony or as satires.  But these first person accounts of messy and misspent lives deserve sympathy.  The stories perceptively weave sad self-descriptions with compelling sagas of family life over several generations.  (The editors, who hold advanced degrees in literature, have no doubt helped here.)  One cannot help but feel pity for sons and daughters raised to be so financially secure, yet so emotionally lost and economically ignorant. 
	The legacy of inherited wealth described here is not one of personal pride in family accomplishments.  Instead, it is one of acute psychological distress over not knowing how to handle amounts of money that others can only dream of.  Confusion, self-pity and guilt permeate the tales of these heirs who have intense memories of their families, but who often seem to enjoy no personal ties to them.  The heirs' stories show how deeply affected they are by the strong wills and striking personalities of their parents and grandparents, but they describe their own lives as drifting and listless.  As each tells his own story, certain common patterns emerge.
	*Money is a crutch:  David Bowman wants a serious and creative career, but he notes how easily he falls back on the privileges of his wealth when the demands of his projects become too stressful.
	*Money is a puzzle:  Rebecca Hutchins receives regular dividends from her grandfather's trust.  She is bored and confused by financial advice and is ashamed to admit it.  But trying to actively manage her wealth would require that she overcome her passivity and deal with her difficult family.
	*Money is a trap: Rachel Halpern was taught the work ethic by her parents.  She thinks she should be paid for her work and treated no differently from her co-workers.  But she feels guilty demanding a wage from a hard-pressed employer when her trusts are worth $<br>6 million.  
	*Money is a threat:  Fred Hopgood is afraid that others will take advantage of his money.  His friendships and marriage end because of his suspicions.
	*Money is a double-edged weapon:  Several heirs choose marriage partners to spite their families and repudiate their privileged upbringing.  But then they resent writing checks to support their poor, unfashionable or reckless spouses.
	The founders of The Inheritance Project have encouraged heirs to tell their stories for reasons they provide in a project brochure.  They think that by talking about the impact of inherited wealth on their lives, heirs will "break the isolation and challenge the taboos surrounding wealth."  Heirs will also learn how others have "claimed their personal power and used it to benefit others."  And they will become familiar with "networking and educational resources to heirs and professionals who work with them."
	The Inheritance Project at first appears to be some sort of recovery group, albeit one serving a very exclusive clientele.  Heirs are invited to set up confidential appointments to share their feelings and experiences with a sympathetic listener.  But some aspects of it (evident in lists of workshops, contacts, and publications) suggest that the Project encourages yet another bizarre form of postmodern identity politics.  It is intimated that heirs _ the term "heiress," I suspect, is inadmissable _ will discover their common victimization, become empowered to reclaim their identities, and will work to overcome the forces that oppress them and separate them from others.  
	Several heirs explain in their interviews that they are doing just that.  Wendy Johnson reports that she no longer feels guilty about her wealth.  She has sold the defense stocks in her $1 million investment portfolio and invested her daughter's trust in Working Assets Mutual Funds, which screens out companies that are not socially responsible.  Chuck Collins has given away his inheritance and attends "wealth conferences" organized by the Haymarket People's Fund which is committed to funding "change, not charity."  (Collins' work with community housing loan funds and land trusts has taught him that the home mortgage interest deduction is a "mansion subsidy" for the rich.)  Deborah Frank contributes her income from seven irrevocable trusts to grassroots community development groups.  "With one stroke, I am able to help support community development and get even with my parents, too."
	But this poses a problem, in that it discourages heirs from becoming true philanthropists and helping others to escape poverty. Heirs who think they are not really entitled to their families' fortunes are not likely to support philanthropies that offer the poor the means to acquire wealth.  After all, if wealth only creates unearned privilege, then there is no nobility in encouraging others to pursue it.  Heirs who contribute instead to causes that prevent the accumulation of wealth will overcome the conditions that leave them feeling guilty.  The resulting condition leaves everyone poorer. Karl Marx, call your psychiatrist!

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>
	Regarding your recent essay about the Joyce Foundation [vol. 1, no.6, July, 1996], there are several factual errors in the few paragraphs relating to the Joyce-funded project in Indiana. As a journalist for the past 19 years, I have always found it useful to actually interview the people I write about -- no one called me. Most notably, you criticize the Indianpolis Star over its excellent series of stories about the role of money in the state legislature, "Of course, the story paid scant attention to the interests of foundations or the power of their money."
	Such a comment is flat-out wrong. The Indianapolis Star coverage disclosed and credited both the Joyce Foundation support and the Center for Public Integrity for creating a 19,000-document database from 1994 campaign records chronicling contributions to Republicans and Democrats, from individuals, labor unions, law firms, etc. If someone contributed money to the process, it was recorded at the state election commission, in the Center database, in the Indianapolis Star, and elsewhere. As you know, philanthropic foundations do not make political contributions.	
	The work in Indianapolis is a spectacular, unprecedented example of vital information about our democracy being made availabe to the public. Legislators in Indiana and other states use taxpayer money to buy themselves laptop computers, but keep information about who is bankrolling their political campaigns on less accessible "paper" records physically kept in a single location in the state.
	The project is nonpartisan, non-ideological and about something every American today supports: free and open public discourse and disclosure about our political process. Today, the citizens of Indiana know more about who funds their state legislature than they ever have. Humbly stated, we think that is important.
<p>Charles Lewis <br>
Executive Director<br>
The Center for Public Integrity<br>
Washington, DC<br>
<p>
<p>
	We did not call Charles Lewis because we had already talked to  him in person on April 14, 1996 at the Council on Foundations meeting in Atlanta after he presented the results of  the Center for Public Integrity's  "Statehouse Sellout" project -- on a panel which did not contain a single conservative or Republican representative [for more on the conference, see vol.1, no. 5, "The Council on Foundations Message To America: The Era Of Lady Bountiful Is Over"].
	Our account of the Center for Public Integrity's activies in Indiana is accurate. In fact, Lewis now confirms that his series ignored political activities of foundations such as Joyce, using the legal prohibition on philanthropic campaign contributions as a rationale. That is a legalism that has nothing to do with the question of  integrity with which his organization purports to be concerned. Many foundations classify political activities as "educational" or "outreach" in order to get around such strictures. 
	Lewis's claims to non-ideological  nonpartisanship are similarly suspect. The advisory board of the Center for Public Integrity on his letterhead lists Mother Jones contributor Molly Ivins, Carter administration State Department spokesman Hodding Carter, and Kennedy administration aide Arthur Schle-singer, Jr. on a clearly pro-liberal Democrat roster of names.
	We raised this issue of bias to Lewis in the specific case of ties between Minister Louis Farrakhan, his affiliated organizations and individuals, and the Democrats.  When we personally spoke with Lewis in Atlanta we had asked: Had his organization ever published a single investigation of ties between the Nation of Islam and the Democrats? His reply was negative. When will you do so?, we pressed. "You'll have to read our magazine," he said. We are still waiting.

<h2>Federal Funding for the CPB Is Neither Necessary Nor Deserved</h2>
<i>March 6, 1996</i>
<P>
WASHINGTON - When the 104th Congress cut federal payments to the
Corporation for Public Broadcasting in 1995, funding pledges to
CPB-funded stations increased 12.9 percent in a single month,
and total dollars pledged grew by 15.3 percent This rise in private
donations is one of two major reasons why taxpayer dollars should
no longer be used to support the CPB.
<P>
&quot;Events have shown that public broadcasting has other sources
of revenue which, if properly utilized, can more than make up
for the small fraction of the budget provided by the federal government
through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting,&quot; said Laurence
Jarvik, Ph.D., <A HREF="/crc/fw">Foundation Watch</A> editor and
cultural studies fellow at Capital Research Center. <I>Foundation
Watch</I><B> </B>monitors the activities of philanthropic foundations
such as those which support the CPB and its affiliates.
<P>
In <A HREF="#testimony">testimony</A> Wednesday before the House
Appropriations Subcommittee for Labor, Health and Human Services,
and Education, Jarvik cited facts and figures proving private
donations to public broadcasting entities around the country can
more than make up for cuts in federal funding. For instance, Santa
Monica, California's National Public Radio (NPR) station, KCRW,
raised $1.09 million in a single February pledge drive, a 26 percent
rise over the previous year.
<P>
Not only does the Corporation for Public Broadcasting need no
taxpayer dollars to fund its operations, Jarvik said it doesn't
deserve them either. He listed nine examples of politically-biased
decisions from the CPB, the Public Broadcasting System and NPR,
including the rejection of Christian Coalition Executive Director
Ralph Reed's request to reply to NPR commentator Andrei Codrescru's
declaration that some basic evangelical Christian beliefs are
&quot;crap&quot; and that he hoped four million believers would
be &quot;evaporated.&quot;
<P>
&quot;In large measure CPB has not been reauthorized due to its
own failures to insure the integrity of the public broadcasting
system, maintain its balance, oversee its objectivity or guarantee
its managerial competence,&quot; Jarvik said.
<P>
Jarvik has testified before this congressional committee in the
past, and has edited three books concerning the federal government's
role in the arts: &quot;The National Endowments: A Critical Symposium&quot;;
&quot;Public Broadcasting and the Public Trust&quot;; and &quot;Masterpiece
Theatre and the Politics of Quality.&quot; He earned his doctorate
and master of fine arts in film and television from UCLA, where
he was Hugh Downs Fellow and winner of the Distinguished Scholar
Award.

</center>
<P>

Mr. Chairman, and members of the subcommittee, thank you for inviting
me to testify today regarding the appropriation for the Corporation
for Public Broadcasting (CPB) for Fiscal Year 1999. I am Cultural
Studies Fellow at the Capital Research Center and editor of <I>Foundation
Watch</I>, a newsletter which covers the activities of philanthropic
foundations such as those which support PBS and NPR.
<P>
Last year, when I testified before this subcommittee, the Speaker
of the House had just announced that in order to help balance
the budget and reduce the federal deficit, he would &quot;zero
out&quot; the federal subsidy for public broadcasting because
it was an unnecessary Federal expenditure. The Speaker was right
then, and his statement has withstood the test of time. Events
have shown that public broadcasting has other sources of revenue
which, if properly utilized, can more than make up for the small
fraction of the budget provided by the Federal government through
the CPB. According to &quot;MediaNomics,&quot; (a publication
of Brent Bozell's Media Research Center) an analysis by editor
Tim Lamer of PBS's reported fundraising totals reveals that after
Congress cut the federal payment to PBS last year, overall revenues
to local stations from private donors <I>increased substantially</I>
more than making up for the reduction in federal spending, at
no cost to the American taxpayer.
<P>
According to Lamer, for example, Santa Monica California's NPR
station, KCRW, raised $1.09 million in a single February pledge
drive, a 26 percent rise over the previous year. Arkansas Educational
Television surpasssed its $350,000 fundraising goal while reducing
pledge breaks by 10 percent. KRMA, in Denver, Colorado, reported
a 13 percent uptick, and WETA in Washington, DC announced 62 percent
of a $1 million drive came <I>from new members</I>. KCET, Los
Angeles released a figure of $1.68 million, some $205,000 more
than in 1994. Overall, March 1995 pledges were 12.9 percent higher
than in 1994, and total dollars pledged were up by 15.3 percent.
Lamer notes private foundations also increased their contributions.
In 1994 Chicago's MacArthur Foundation gave $1,295,470. Last year
it provided $4,139,700. The Mott Foundation gave $590,000 in 1994,
$935,000 in 1995. The Pew Charitable Trusts increased its contribution
level from $2,740,000 in 1994 to $3,896,000 in 1995.
<P>
And successful private fundraising continues. Just this week,
for example, Channel 26 reported some $177,820 in pledges, including
over $35,000 from an airing of a Peter, Paul, and Mary concert
film, and what the <I>Washington Post</I> called an &quot;astounding&quot;
$94,389 from a one-night-only &quot;Les Miserables in Concert.&quot;
In New York, the same program netted $400,000 in only 3 1/2 hours.
PBS has been proud to announce a number of lucrative business
deals, most notably as $75 million agreement with <I>Reader's
Digest</I> to produce new programs for the network.
<P>
PBS program producers have also managed to make a number of new
deals, with Children's Television Workshop (CTW), producers of
<I>Sesame Street</I>, announcing the start of a children's cable
channel, for example. One might remind the subcommittee that Children's
Television Workshop continues its lucrative licensing, merchandising,
and other fundraising endeavors which result in gross sales of
almost a billion dollars a year in related merchandise, and gross
revenues to CTW of approximately $100 million annually.
<P>
Despite recent revelations about Chinese human rights violations
by activists such as Harry Wu whom I was honored to meet at a
Progress and Freedom Foundation reception &quot;Sesame Street&quot;
products can be found today on the shelves clearly marked &quot;Made
In China.&quot; China still bans political dissent, persecutes
Christians, forces women to have abortions, and operates orphanages
which are unhealthy for children. And, as AFL-CIO spokeswoman
Chyrol Graeve has noted, &quot;toy workers are paid less than
a dollar an hour.&quot; More than 250 Asian toy workers have lost
their lives in the past two years as the result of fires and other
industrial accidents. Nevertheless, Children's Television Workshop
continues to pay its top executives six figure salaries while
licensing to toy companies who manufacture in Asia. It is highly
questionable whether a reasonable case can be made that enterprises
with such manifest insensitivity to human rights violations deserve
continued federal subsidy at any level.
<P>
There can be no doubt that had Congress followed through on the
original privatization plan endorsed at the time by the entire
Congressional leadership including Appropriations Committee Chairman
Livingston and Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Pressler and
still evident in the public positions taken by the Dole and Buchanan
campaigns, for example public broadcasting might have been fully
self-sufficient today. We would not need to be spending time discussing
appropriation levels for 1999, some three years hence, for an
entity which has not been reauthorized.
<P>
In large measure CPB has not been reauthorized due to its own
failures to insure the integrity of the public broadcasting system,
maintain its balance, oversee its objectivity, or guarantee its
managerial competence. CPB's record was called &quot;contempt
of Congress&quot; in an issue of <I>Comint: A Journal About Public
Media</I> last year. Nothing has transpired to change that evaluation.
Certainly, CPB does not deserve any sort of &quot;trust fund&quot;
because it has lost its right to the public trust through its
own mismanagement.
<P>
Evidence of CPB's failure to exercise effective oversight of the
public broadcasting system has been widely reported over the last
year. Some examples of problems which CPB has failed to resolve
are:
<UL>
<LI>As I reported in the <A HREF="/crc/fw/fw-v1n1.html">premiere issue of Foundation Watch</A>,
(February, 1996) PBS's so-called &quot;Democracy Project&quot;
has been more like the Democrat project. I could not get the name
of a single Republican staffer in a decision-making job dealing
with coverage of the 1996 election at PBS from the director of
the project, who happens to be the wife of a Clinton political
appointee in the State Department. In what seems like deliberate
challenge to even the appearance of balance and objectivity as
required by law, PBS's new director of communications is the former
political director for the Clinton White House. Incredibly, PBS
does not feel the slightest obligation for even a token Republican
executive in the programming department.
<LI>PBS's so-called &quot;National Issues Convention&quot; was
rife with the appearance of conflict-of-interest and misrepresentation
of its goals and methods. Misleading at best in its claim to be
a &quot;deliberative poll&quot; former CBS polling chief Warren
Mitofsky declared it &quot;was not deliberative and not a poll&quot;
false and deceptive at worst, PBS had sponsored a &quot;pseudo-event&quot;
which wasted some $4 million dollars, approximately half of which
is reportedly straight from the PBS budget. PBS also provided
some nine hours of valuable airtime which could have produced
additional revenue streams to the network.
<LI>PBS rejected <I>The Children of Table 34</I>, a documentary
produced in cooperation with the <A HREF="http://www.frc.org">Family Research Council</A>
(FRC), about the controversy over the use of underage children
for sex research by Dr. Kinsey. The story was reported in <I>The
Washington Post </I>Style section. But PBS declined to help the
Family Research Council to bring this case before the American
public. Yet, as Robert Knight, director of Cultural Studies for
the FRC points out, PBS stations repeated <I>Tales of the City</I>,
a program many found highly offensive for its use of profanity,
glamorization of drug use, and sexual promiscuity.
<LI>PBS rejected <I>Covering Cuba</I>, and independent film by
Augustin Blazquez, which detailed the mainstream media's infatuation
with Fidel Castro since 1959. He first offered his picture in
October, 1995 and Blazquez volunteered to re-edit the film to
meet PBS standards. Despite numerous pro-Castro films on PBS,
and an obvious need for balance in this regard, Blazquez was not
given a chance to air his picture on PBS. Ironically, only a few
weeks ago, Castro's planes shot down American citizens in an incident
which confirmed Blazquez's depiction of the Cuban dictator and
his policies.
<LI>PBS has still not aired an episode of <I>The American Experience</I>
to correct &quot;Holocaust revisionism&quot; in <I>Liberators:
Fighting on Two Fronts in World War II.</I> Congressman Laughlin
of Texas has delivered a speech denouncing this hoax on the House
floor. Colonel James Moncrief, Jr. the senior surviving officer
of the Sixth Armored Division which actually liberated Buchenwald
presented written testimony to the authorizing subcommittee asking
that PBS correct the historical record. I personally met with
Congressman Joel Hefley of Colorado and Col. Moncrief right here
in the Rayburn Building to discuss this problem. Colonel Moncrief
has written numerous letters to PBS and CPB, yet the network still
refuses to air a documentary about the actual liberators of the
Nazi camps. If I could find them and I introduced Col. Moncrief
to a senior staffer on Senator Pressler's Commerce Committee as
well so could PBS. CPB has done nothing whatever in this case,
despite its legal obligation to insure the excellence and integrity
of public broadcasting, and the offer of Col. Moncrief's help.
<LI><I>Frontline</I> has aired a number of troubling documentaries
in the past year, including a show about the Speaker of the House
which included gratuitous footage of a heckler making offensive
and possibly obscene remarks about allegations of sexual indiscretions;
another program about killings at an abortion clinic in which
four-letter words were used without being bleeped, and in relation
to which a number of women came forward to allege (in a story
reported by Peter Steinfels in the <I>New York Times</I>) that
their point-of-view had been omitted by the producers as a symptom
of anti-Catholic bias; and a third program this year, about campaign
contributions, which was so unbalanced that even liberal columnist
David Broder condemned it in <I>The Washington Post </I>for presenting
a distorted portrayal of both the Clinton administration and Congress.
Neither CPB nor PBS have announced any balancing programming for
any of these cases.
</UL>

<P>
At NPR, the situation has not been any better. Some examples give
evidence of CPB failure to provide reasonable oversight:
<UL>
<LI>NPR commentator Andrei Codrescru declared that some basic
evangelical Christian beliefs were &quot;crap&quot; and that he
hoped four million believers would be &quot;evaporated.&quot;
Although after protests, did NPR issue a lame apology, Christian
Coalition executive director Ralph Reed's request for two minutes
of NPR airtime to reply to the attack was flatly refused. No editors
or executives have been publicly disciplined for permitting the
commentary on the air.
</UL>

<P>
In a letter dated February 27, 1996, Rev. Donald Wildmon of the
American Family Association wrote that &quot;it is absurd for
the government to be in the public broadcasting business...There
are more than 1300 Christian broadcasters in America. Our government
will not give them one penny. But we readily give those billions
to PBS, NPR and CPB. This is nothing more than censorship by the
government, to fund one perspective and not another...It is time
for PBS, NPR, and CPB to get off the government welfare dole and
get out and raise their money like other broadcasters do.&quot;
<UL>
<LI>NPR has not yet asked for a refund of commentary fees paid
to convicted murderer Mumia Abu-Jamal for his <I>Live from Death
Row</I>, the book based on these un-aired programs (because of
protests from critics such as Senator Dole) which is being sold
commercially.
<LI>NPR stations recently broadcast &quot;Blacklisted&quot; at
a cost of $160,00, half of which was paid by CPB itself. The three-part
series was produced by the son of screenwriter Gordon Kahn, and
portrayed his father as &quot;unjustly persecuted,&quot; by anti-Communists,
as Accuracy in Media's Reed Irvine notes, in &quot;an extreme
form of the sanitized obituary.&quot; Irvine points out that Kahn,
as a Communist Party member, was &quot;part of Stalin's secret
team in Hollywood...no more decent and honest than Hitler's favorite
movie maker, Leni Riefenstahl.&quot; According to Irvine, &quot;Communists
were trying to impose upon America and the world a system that
was at least as evil, oppressive and dangerous as the Nazism we
fought a war to defeat and destroy.&quot;
</UL>

<P>
&quot;Kahn and his comrades failed to bring about the triumph
of Communism,&quot; says Irvine. &quot;It is not they, but those
who worked to stop them that NPR should honor.&quot; As of this
date, I am not aware of any three-hour NPR series presenting Reed
Irvine's point of view, or honoring anti-Communists in Hollywood
such as former President Ronald Reagan.
<P>
Unfortunately, time does not permit mentioning all the outstanding
problems in public broadcasting. Let me just conclude with the
scandal reported in the <I>Washington Post</I> recently, where
an innocent member of the CPB board of directors who had been
concerned with questions of financial mismanagement found herself
smeared as a sex harasser after confidential personnel documents
were leaked to reporters. CPB spent an estimated $20,000 on lawyers
&quot;investigating&quot; this matter, yet never managed to get
around to asking the alleged perpetrator what had happened, nor
giving that person the right to self defense.
<P>
Yet CPB has never managed to explain precisely how the documents
got to the press, nor how management could justify the expenditure
of tax dollars <I>when no formal complaint of sexual harassment
had ever been filed. </I>This widely reported case is evidence
that there is something very wrong in public broadcasting, sufficiently
wrong that even thinking about funding for the year 1999 should
simply be postponed pending the outcome of an investigation into
how CPB treats such questions as allegations of sexual harassment,
and what efforts are made to preserve the privacy of personnel
files.
<P>
In addition, articles in the <I>Sunday Times of London</I> contained
allegations attributed to CPB officials which were later found
to be without a basis in fact against the First Lady. As of this
date, I have not been able to find out who made the charges, which
were characterized at the time by CPB board member Victor Gold
as part of a &quot;smear.&quot; Insofar as CPB is required to
maintain the integrity of news and current affairs programming
for PBS, NPR, and Pacifica, CPB should determine who was behind
this &quot;smear,&quot; and invoke appropriate sanctions. If CPB
will not do this, Congress has an obligation to investigate this
matter, which is a serious blemish on the character and trustworthiness
of public broadcasting.
<P>
Until such basic questions as those above have been fully answered
by CPB, it certainly should not receive any advanced appropriation.
There are two years for CPB to resolve these concerns by 1998,
when appropriations for 1999 are to be determined by Congress.
The intervening period should be used by Congress to fully exercise
its oversight responsibilities. I remain confident any reasonable
review will conclude that continued federal funding for the Corporation
for Public Broadcasting is unnecessary, unwise, and contrary to
the best interests of the American public and public broadcasting
itself.

<CENTER><H2>If They Only Knew Then What We Know Now About the AARP</H2></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><H3>by Terrence Scanlon</CENTER>
<CENTER>President, Capital Research Center</H3><BR>
</CENTER>
<P>
 When my parents joined the American Association of Retired Persons,
they thought like many seniors that they were getting affordable
supplemental health insurance, manageable credit card interest
rates and an attractive magazine.  But there is much more to the
AARP than most of its members know.  The AARP is a taxpayer-funded
lobbyist that actively promotes bigger government and, ultimately,
more spending on itself.<BR>
<P>
 The federal government uses tax-exempt, non-profit organizations
like AARP to run the thousands of programs that make up the welfare
state.  These groups receive, on average, about half their funding
from Uncle Sam.  These subsidies give them the clout to form a
&quot;shadow government&quot; inside the Washington Beltway to
lobby incessantly for more welfare programs, more regulation and
higher taxes.  AARP promotes rent control laws, raising the minimum
wage and increa sing the gasoline tax.  All these programs make
seniors more dependent on government.<BR>
<P>
 The AARP, the National Council of Senior Citizens (NCSC) and
dozens of lesser-known organizations that make up the seniors
lobby have become expert at using the elderly to build their own
power.<BR>
<P>
 For instance, in 1992 the federal government gave the AARP $86
million for senior employment and tax preparation programs.  Additionally,
because the AARP is a tax-exempt, non-profit organization, you
and I worked to make up the difference on the taxes the AARP did
not pay on the $191 million it earned in 1993 by selling insurance,
pharmaceuticals and auto-club services.  <BR>
<P>
 Another big recipient of federal funds is the National Council
of Senior Citizens (NCSC). In 1993, it received 96 percent of
its $76-million budget ($73 million) from the federal government.
 While this money can't legally be used for lobbying, taxpayers
still indirectly finance AARP and NCSC lobbying.  Money is &quot;fungible,&quot;
which is another way of saying that government dollars free-up
other dollars for lobbying.<BR>
<P>
 Recently, these two organizations raised their taxpayer-funded
voices loud enough to drown out reports on the coming bankruptcy
of Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.  These are the three
federal programs on which the elderly rely most.  Trustees of
these programs report that America's aging population will spend
the money in their coffers faster than the smaller, working-age
population can re-fill them.  That leaves America with two alternatives
-- reduce benefits for the retired or increase taxes on workers.
<BR>
<P>
 If we raise taxes, the cost of Social Security and Medicare by
2040 will eat up an economy-busting 35-55 percent of every worker's
paycheck.  The 104th Congress decided instead to slow the rise
in Medicare benefits, proposing an increase from $4,800 per patient
in 1995 to $6,500 in 2001.  But AARP and NCSC shouted down this
attempt at true reform with bogus charges of &quot;cutting&quot;
benefits for enrollees.<BR>
<P>
 In its new book, <U>Frightening America's Elderly:  How the Age
Lobby Holds Seniors Captive</U>, Capital Research Center documents
how the seniors lobby promotes costly and inefficient government
programs, mandates and regulations while securing tax dollars
for itself.  Author Thomas diLorenzo alerts seniors that such
programs are bankrupting our country and jeopardizing their grandchildren's
futures without increasing their own security and independence.
<BR>
<P>
 The special interest lobbyists whose paychecks are tied to failed
welfare-state programs are stalling innovative reforms.  Americans,
young and old, need to know what they are doing.  <U>Frightening
America's Elderly</U> is the first step toward opening our eyes.
 I wish my parents had known then what I know now.<BR>

<center><H3>Preface<br>
by Senator Alan Simpson (R-WY)</H3></center>
<P>
<P>
<P>        Imagine for a moment a thriving business enterprise, pulling in annual revenues of hundreds 
of millions of dollars.  Imagine, too, that through a quirk in the law, this business pays none of the 
income taxes to which its competitors are subjected.  Exorbitant salaries and benefits are paid from 
this huge tax-free income, and employees work in splendor in an enormous palace complete with 
marble floors and every possible manner of technological luxury.
<P>        Let us also imagine that this business has also succeeded in becoming the most powerful 
lobbying force in Washington, completely dwarfing and dominating some of the more publicized 
groups such as the NRA, the NEA, or the Christian Coalition.  The surest measure of its success is 
the amount of federal spending which its lobbying has succeeded in persuading Washington to 
spend on its clients--in this case, the business's millions of loyal customers.  Year upon year, 
without exception, the largest increases in federal spending are awarded to those in the group, even 
to the point where the projections are that every penny of federal tax revenue will be awarded to 
them in the early 21st century.
<P>        Imagine as well that most of the customers of the business have little or no idea of what it is 
up to.  Suppose that many of the customers believe in limited government, and firmly and 
repeatedly say that they oppose continued escalations in tax rates.  Suppose that the executives 
controlling the business are aware that many of their customers either do not favor the huge 
escalation in federal spending which they are advocating, or are unaware of it.  Nonetheless, this 
influential business informs officeholders in the national government that failure to continue to 
increase spending in this manner will draw the united electoral wrath of the customers--33,000,000 
strong.
<P>        Now suppose that this business is favored each year with tens of millions of dollars in direct 
grants from the federal government.  The American taxpayer thus pays directly for the services 
purchased by the grants, activities which serve to spread the good name and reputation of our 
"hypothetical" business.
<P>        Ah, but--incredible though it may seem, there is such a business--the American Association 
of Retired Persons.  Only recently have many Americans come to understand what this group is 
really all about.  I have often referred to them as 33,000,000 people bound together by a common 
love of airline discounts--and insurance discounts--and pharmacy discounts.  Because, in my view, 
that is exactly who their members are--common, thoughtful, patriotic people who know a "pretty 
good deal" when they see one, and yet have no desire whatsoever to bankrupt the government, the 
nation, and their grandkids.
<P>        While I was serving on the President's Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax 
Reform, I was intrigued and perplexed by the testimony that the AARP presented before the 
Commission.  We showed the AARP representatives the clear and irrefutable data revealing that the 
federal government was headed towards extremities of debt, driven almost wholly by growth in 
spending on the AARP's membership (i.e., senior citizens.)  We sought the counsel of the AARP 
about just how to avoid the certainty of national ruin that resided in maintaining the status quo.  
They didn't bat an eye.  They not only defended every single penny of projected federal spending 
increases, but presented more demands for an additional trillion dollars in spending above that.  
They could just as easily have said, "Let them eat cake."
<P>        Mystified by the willful irresponsibility of this
organization, I determined to learn more about who they were and what was driving their activities. 
<P> I was intrigued to learn that most of the AARP's money did not come in the form of dues from the 
people it claimed to represent, hut rather from an enormous tax-free business empire.  I was 
absolutely flabbergasted to find that the federal government had given $86,000,000 in grants to this 
political behemoth in just the past year.
<P>        When I became Chairman of the Subcommittee on Social Security and Family Policy, I 
began to hold hearings into the nature of this beast.  A story began to unravel, of a complexity 
which I could not possibly track.  I had no special investigative staff and quickly found that there 
was no simple answer to the question, "What is the AARP?"
<P>        When asking about how it was founded and funded, we learned that its origin lay with a 
man who once had been stripped of his license to sell insurance and had hit upon this ingenious 
method of running an awesome insurance empire tax-free.  When asking about how AARP became 
hooked up with Prudential Insurance, we found that the precipitating event was a lawsuit involving 
a former AARP Executive Director who, after being sacked by the AARP, alleged various 
corruptions and illegalities in the relationship between AARP and Colonial Penn insurance, its 
previous carrier--all now well described, apparently, in sealed court records.
<P>        When we asked about AARP's advertisement of commercial products, we found that it 
repeatedly had been assessed penalties by the Postal Service for failing to pay the proper rates.  
When we asked about the purposes of federal grants to AARP, we found that the organization was 
providing "tax counseling" to senior citizens, while at the same time it was required to make a 
$135,000,000 payment in lieu of taxes to the IRS--for failure to adhere to our tax laws.  And the list 
went on, and on, and on.
<P>        I did not possess anything close to the resources necessary to get to the center of this 
labyrinth, and it is doubtful that anyone ever will.  I am told that the AARP is attempting to "turn 
over a new leaf," that it no longer wishes to be synonymous with ever-expanding government.  I 
certainly hope that is true.  During my hearings, the AARP was still claiming that its legislative 
stances were the product of careful consultation with its membership.  Yet at the same time, internal 
AARP polling data was showing us how the AARP was losing membership precisely because it 
was taking positions against balanced budgets and in favor of many massive new health care 
entitlements.  Those internal contradictions, I am told, are now being felt and fully addressed by the 
AARP itself.  In any event, let us hope that this is the case.
<P>        <I>Frightening Americas Elderly</I> provides a brief and valuable synopsis of the 
principal facts about the AARP and other seniors organizations.  As the possessor of a sizable stack 
of chaotic, random and disorganized material about the AARP, I commend Tom DiLorenzo and the 
Capital Research Center for condensing this serpentine tale into a direct and comprehensible tract.  
The reader will come away from this text knowing far more than even most AARP members do 
about the nature of that organization.
<P>        Our national motto is, "E pluribus unum"--"Out of many, one."  Our great strength as a 
nation has always been the openness and tolerance which has allowed us to transform a huge 
diversity of viewpoints into instruments of our great national interest.  But it is this forging of 
diversity into unity that is all-important.  When speaking to constituents, I am often compelled to 
remind them that "You are citizens first.  You are not Farm Bureau members first, or NEA 
members first, or journalists first, or NRA members first, or members of the AARP first.  You are 
citizens first!  Your first obligation is as a citizen of this nation, and every other membership is 
secondary."  
<P>        Too often in Washington, the voices we hear are the sum total of the special interests which 
have converged upon the nation's capital, drowning out the voice of the general interest of the 
American citizenry.  There are huge organizations devoted to protecting and defending the dollars 
being shipped to every imaginable organized constituency--and the more sympathetic the cause of 
the recipient, the easier the lobbying for it.  The elderly, the children, the middle class, the poor, the 
veterans--it seems there is no amount of money that Congress can spend on such groups that will 
grant it immunity from the charge of heartless cruelty to the downtrodden.
	We are now truly at a crossroads in American political history.  To continue to heed the hyperbolic, harsh and hyped rhetoric of one particular lobbying behemoth--the AARP--will spell mortal peril for the economic future of the nation.  The more we know 
mission, and structure, the better.  Accordingly, the descriptions that you are about to read are 
exceptionally important ones, and they provide critical knowledge relevant to any discussion about 
this country's budgetary priorities.  I trust that the gentle reader will find <I>Frightening Americas 
Elderly</I> most intriguing and informative!  Enjoy!

<P>
	If the Social Security and Medicare balance sheets were evaluated according to private-
sector accounting standards, both would be declared disastrously insolvent. -- Peter G. 
Peterson
<P>
<P>
<P>
	The "baby boomers"--the huge generation born between the late 1940s and mid-1960s--
have dominated America's commercial life for decades.  American business has long understood 
that the key to selling goods and services to this generation is to cater to its needs and preferences.  
The baby boomers have not only reshaped markets but have had a profound impact on our most 
enduring social and political institutions.
<P>        In the very near future, demographic trends will dictate that the interests and demands of 
baby boomers dominate government retirement and health policy, particularly Social Security and 
Medicare policy.  Together, Social Security and Medicare are the largest items in the federal 
budget: they account for about 34 percent of all federal expenditures and are projected to reach 39 
percent by 2005, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
<P>        Policymakers will have to face up to some unavoidable facts about the aging baby boomers 
and about the American population in general.  These realities will have a major impact on 
government retirement and health programs:
<UL>
	<LI> People are living longer.  In 1935, when the Social Security system was established, the 
average life expectancy was 61 years.  Today, it is 77 at birth and 82 if one reaches age 65.  Since 
the turn of the century, the number of Americans over 65 has increased almost elevenfold.  By 
contrast, the under-65 population only tripled during the last 100 years.  In 1900, one out of 25 
Americans was over 65; today the number is one in eight.  And the elderly population is expected 
to continue growing: a big jump will occur between 2005 and 2030 as the baby boomers reach 
retirement.  By 2025, as former U.S. Commerce Secretary Peter G. Peterson recently noted in the 
<I>Atlantic Monthly</I>, America will become "a nation of Floridas," with the proportion of all 
Americans who are elderly the same as the proportion of elderly in Florida today.
	<LI> In 1950, there were approximately 16 working-age Americans for every person over age 
65.  But by 2030, there will be just two working-age Americans for every person over 65.  Far 
fewer workers will have to support far more retirees if we continue to rely on the current Social 
Security and Medicare systems.
	<LI> The graying of America will increase demands on the health-care system, leading to much 
higher health-care costs if fundamental changes are not made to Social Security and Medicare.
	These trends, <I>Newsweek</I> recently noted, "doom Social Security and Medicare in 
their present form" because "the required tax burdens would be horrendous" and ultimately 
unacceptable to taxpayers.  With fewer taxpayers supporting more Social Security and Medicare 
recipients, either massive tax increases or significant benefit reductions will be necessary if these 
programs are left unchanged.  Peterson argues that if the system is not reformed, the cost of Social 
Security and Medicare by 2040 will take between 35 and 55 percent of every worker's paycheck 
"before we even start to pay for the rest of what government does.  Obviously, tax increases of this 
size would destroy the economy."  This kind of tax burden would also likely create 
"intergenerational warfare" as younger generations revolted against working half a year or more 
just to pay for the benefits of retirees.

economist James T. Bennett and I describe how the government uses thousands of tax-exempt 
nonprofit organizations to administer the myriad programs that comprise the welfare state.  These 
organizations receive on average about half their funding from government, and they form a 
"shadow government"--a virtual appendage of government--that lobbies incessantly for expanded 
welfare programs. Incredibly, much of this lobbying is funded either directly or indirectly with tax 
dollars.
<P>        The seniors lobby is typical of this phenomenon.  The American Association of Retired 
Persons (AARP), the National Council of Senior Citizens (NCSC), the Gray Panthers, and dozens 
of lesser-known organizations were created over the last few decades to ostensibly represent the 
concerns and interests of senior citizens.  But as this study will show, the so-called seniors lobby is, 
for the most part, a coalition of self-appointed activists favoring more government, more regulation, 
and higher taxes--all of which would increase seniors' dependence on government.  A vastly 
expanded government is not in the best interests of the elderly, but it <I>is</I> in the best financial 
and political interests of the seniors lobby.
<P>        This study describes how organizations comprising the seniors lobby promote costly and 
inefficient government programs, mandates, and regulations which they claim are the best way to 
meet the needs of seniors.  Their push for more government continues despite the worldwide 
failures of socialism and the welfare state.  Even democratic countries that have recently elected 
socialist governments--New Zealand is a notable example--are privatizing industries, cutting taxes, 
and discarding many once-sacrosanct welfare programs.  Other countries have abandoned 
government-run insurance programs and are developing creative alternatives that rely on free-
market competition and consumer choice to provide for the elderly.  Their policies, whose features 
can serve as models for U.S. reforms, are described in chapter six.
<P>        Reform-minded policymakers in the U.S. face powerful political opposition from the 
seniors lobby.  As James Bennett and I have shown in <I>Destroying Democracy</I>, entrenched 
special interests whose economic livelihood is tied to the continued expansion of failed welfare-
state programs are stalling innovative changes that are succeeding around the world.  These special 
interests have found it advantageous to organize themselves as tax-exempt, tax-deductible--and 
increasingly taxpayer-funded--nonprofit organizations.
<P>        This is the case with AARP, NCSC, and other seniors groups that have long been part of the 
Washington welfare establishment.  They devote enormous resources to fending off any efforts to 
fundamentally reform Social Security, Medicare, and other government programs.  Ignoring the 
consequences to future retirees, they seek to convince seniors and the public that these programs are 
financially sound and that any problems can be fixed by minor adjustments and tax increases.
<P>        Some of Social Security's most committed supporters have been honest enough to admit 
that it is essentially a Ponzi scheme.  They argue only that it is a darn good one!  Paul Samuelson, a 
Nobel laureate economist at MIT, argued back in 1967 that the "beauty" of Social Security is that 
"everyone who reaches retirement age is given benefit privileges that far exceed anything he has 
paid in [because] the national product is growing at compound interest and can be expected to do so 
for as far ahead as the eye cannot [<I>sic</I>] see. . . .  A <I>growing nation is the greatest Ponzi 
scheme ever contrived</I>" (emphasis added).6
<P>        Charles Ponzi, it should be recalled, was a finance and land speculator who in the 1920s 
gave investors the assurance that inexhaustible supplies of new money from future investors would 
guarantee high rates of return on earlier loans and purchases.  Of course, it all came tumbling down. 
<P> It may have appeared likely to Samuelson in 1967 that Social Security could also continue "as far 
ahead as the eye cannot see."  But America's population trends have changed everything: the annual 
report of the Social Security Trust Fund now projects that the system will be bankrupt by 2029 if it 
remains on its current path.  Medicare is on the same precarious financial course, and is projected to 
go bankrupt much earlier.
<P>        But none of this seems to matter to the seniors lobby.  Claiming that their own interests 
reflect the interests of tens of millions of seniors, organizations like AARP are quick to oppose 
policymakers who seek fundamental reform of programs for the aged.  They try to lull working-age 
Americans into complacency about the impending bankruptcy of Social Security and Medicare 
while frightening the elderly about constructive efforts to resolve the crisis.

	This study describes the agendas, activities, and funding of organizations that comprise the 
seniors lobby and analyzes the social and economic implications of their policy positions.  It 
focuses mostly on the activities of the larger and more established seniors groups since they are the 
most influential.
<P>        Chapter two focuses on the American Association of Retired Persons, specifically, the 
business practices of its $191,000,000-a-year money machine.  It questions whether any of AARP's 
commercial activities, from selling insurance to mutual funds, is appropriate for an organization 
that claims to be a charity.  Does Congress turn a blind eye to AARP's tax-exempt commercial 
businesses because AARP has powerful political ties and clout?
<P>        Chapter three also examines AARP, focusing on its tax-funded political agenda.  It 
describes how AARP lobbied for the failed Clinton health plan as well as for the catastrophic 
health-care plan that Congress enacted in 1989 and later repealed.  It also discusses AARP's efforts 
to dramatically raise taxes, increase government spending, and expand government programs that 
are demonstrably harmful.
<P>        Chapter four provides an overview of the activities and funding of the second most 
politically powerful seniors organization, the National Council of Senior Citizens (NCSC).  
Founded by the Democratic National Committee and AFL-CIO, NCSC received about 96 percent 
of its funding in 1993 from federal tax revenues.  It is less a seniors organization than a labor-union 
front whose political agenda mirrors that of the AFL-CIO--even when that agenda is odds with the 
best interests of most seniors.
<P>        Chapter five reviews the activities and funding of other prominent seniors organizations, 
including the National Council on the Aging, Families U.S.A., National Committee to Preserve 
Social Security and Medicare, Save Our Security Coalition, Older Women's League, and Gray 
Panthers.  These organizations share a dedication to tieing the well-being of seniors to an 
increasingly powerful federal government.
<P>        Not all seniors organizations promote welfare-state dependency for the elderly.  Chapter six 
discusses three groups--The Seniors Coalition, United Seniors Association, and the 60 Plus 
Association--that promote policies based on individual responsibility, consumer choice, free-market 
competition, and limited constitutional government as the best means for meeting the needs of 
seniors.  These organizations understand the seriousness of the financial problems facing Social 
Security and Medicare, and they are developing policy ideas that will guarantee benefits to current 
retirees while reducing the burden on younger generations.  Chapter six also examines the 
promising old-age insurance systems in Chile and Singapore and their implications for the U.S.
<P>        The graying of the baby boom generation will place unprecedented stress on both Social 
Security and Medicare.  As we stand on the threshold of the 21st century, we know that socialism 
and the welfare state have been colossal failures.  It is imperative that public policy for the aged be 
redesigned with this reality in mind.
<P>        Unfortunately, Washington, D.C.-based seniors organizations are defenders of the failed 
Great Society.  They have become a major stumbling block to reform.  If this study can persuade 
more Americans to question the failed ideologies that continue to govern public policy for the aged-
-policies that, if left unchallenged, will spoil the retirement years of the graying baby boomers--it 
will have achieved its purpose.

<a name="intro"></a><h3> Introduction</h3>
<P>
 Concern for the natural environment is an American tradition
with a long and proud history.  The Americans who created modern
industrial society and populated its urban centers in the late
19th and early 20th centuries also established national conservation
organizations.  Because they wanted to retain and enjoy the resources
of nature and pass them on to later generations, they organized
the National Wildlife Federation,
the National Audubon Society and
the Izaak Walton League of America,
and worked with local conservation groups to protect habitat and
maintain the amenities of environmental beauty and recreation.
<P>
 In 1970, millions of Americans celebrated the first Earth
Day.  This event mobilized thousands of activists and spawned
a new generation of environmental groups: The Natural
Resources Defense Council, the Environmental
Defense Fund, Environmental Action,
and the Environmental Policy
Institute were among the new advocacy groups that joined the older
resource conservation and wilderness preservation organizations.
 These groups, however, wanted to impose on the United States
a new philosophy of environmental protection.  They believed the
federal government should exercise primary responsibility for
solving environmental problems, and they aggressively promoted
an agenda of national public policies.  Their ideas were rapidly
adopted by the old-line conservation groups.  A new and powerful
political force was born.
<P>
 The new environmental movement provoked a flurry of legislative
activity.  The National
Environmental Policy Act was signed into law on January 1, 1970.
 Congress then passed the Clean Air
Act (1970), the Clean Water Act
(1972), the Federal
Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (1972), the Endangered
Species Act (1973), and the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act (1976), among many others.  More
laws followed.  By the end of the 1980s, environmental bills accounted
for nearly one-fifth of bills presented to Congress
and almost one-quarter of those enacted into law.
<P>
 The Reagan Administration
has been portrayed as opposed to environmental legislation, but
President Reagan signed laws like
the 1984 amendments to the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act, which gave the federal government
&quot;cradle-to-grave&quot; authority over waste management. 
The Reagan Administration also dramatically increased environmental
enforcement.  For instance, between 1983 and 1989 the Justice
Department more than tripled the amount of fines levied against
those found guilty of &quot;environmental crimes.&quot;
<P>
 George Bush rapidly accelerated
the process.  He pledged to be the &quot;environmental president&quot;
and introduced and signed into law the Clean
Air Act Amendments of 1990, which regulates actual and potential
sources of air pollution from factories and autos to lawnmowers
and grain silos.  It is the nation's most costly environmental
legislation.  His Administration presided over an explosion in
environmental rulemaking--<I>National
Journal</I> labelled Bush the &quot;regulatory president&quot;--as
well as substantial increases in environment-related spending
and federal land acquisition.<BR>

<P><a name="what"></a>
<B>WHAT PRICE ENVIRONMENTALISM?</B>
<P>
 The government's environmental activism has been costly.  The
Environmental Protection
Agency has estimated that Americans spend well over $150 billion
per year complying with environmental regulations--over two percent
of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
 Local governments must comply with nearly 175 unfunded federal
mandates and have to test drinking water for over 100 separate
substances.  Under one hypothesis of risk and cost,
the Office of Management
and Budget has estimated that one waste disposal regulation--a
listing of certain wood-treating chemicals as hazardous wastes--imposes
costs of $5.7 <I>trillion</I> to avert one premature cancer death.
<P>
 When businesses try to absorb the costs of complying with complex
environmental rules and permits, they are likely to pass on the
cost to consumers by raising the price of their products.  And
when they are confronted by the uncertainties of statutory interpretation
and the regulatory enforcement of environmental law they may decide
to slow the development and application of new technologies.
<P>
 Environmental regulation is increasingly expensive and, many
argue, less effective in achieving its goals, particularly in
the area of risk reduction.  Dr. William Cooper,
an ecologist at Michigan State
University, observes: &quot;We're really just about at the end
of the reductions in risk that you can achieve by the conventional
approach, which is to crank down on the pollution coming out of
the end of the pipe.  Now we're into more subtle issues.  How
clean do we really want our environment?  How much are we really
willing to pay for it?&quot;
<P>
 Nor are the regulatory trade-offs only ones of cost against benefit.
 It is also increasingly clear that attempting to improve environmental
quality in one area can hurt the environment in other areas. 
For example, EPA regulations
require the incineration of certain dioxin-contaminated wastes.
 Yet an incinerator that cannot meet the EPA's destruction standard
for dioxin may produce two barrels of dioxin-contaminated ash
for every barrel of dioxin-contaminated waste that it burns. 
Under current federal law, this ash cannot be put in a landfill.
 <I>The </I><I>New York Times</I> revealed
that ash of this kind from an incinerator at an abandoned Arkansas
chemical factory had to be stored in perpetuity in a $300,000
facility built for that purpose.  The total cost of that single
&quot;cleanup&quot; operation was over $25 million and could reach
up to $175 million.
<P>
 Or consider the Endangered
Species Act (ESA).  Under the Act, landowners lose the right to
use their land as they see fit when an endangered animal is discovered
on it.  Landowners cannot build or enlarge their homes, plant
crops, or cut down trees.  Rather than protect wildlife, the ESA
punishes landowners, in effect, for creating or maintaining a
species habitat.  The Act creates disincentives for protecting
endangered species.  Michael Bean of the
Environmental Defense Fund (EDF)
observes that landowners who find an endangered species on their
property may well decide to destroy it and its habitat before
it is discovered by federal authorities--a process
some call &quot;shoot, shovel, and shut up.&quot;  Nonetheless,
EDF and most other environmental groups remain steadfast supporters
of the ESA.<BR>

<P><a name="media"></a>
<B>MEDIA SKEPTICISM</B>
<P>
 The late journalist Warren Brookes was
among the first writers to expose the economic ignorance of environmental
policymakers and challenge their misuse of science.  His example
has been followed by writers for <I>Forbes</I>,
<I>The </I><I>Washington Times</I> and
the <I>Detroit News</I>, among other publications.
 Conservative and libertarian publications like <I>Reason,
</I><I>Insight, </I><I>Human
Events</I>, and <I>National Review</I>
also have focused attention on the failings of conventional environmental
analysis.  More recently, the major media have begun to look skeptically
at the claims of environmentalism.
<P>
<ul>
 <li>In December 1990, the popular
CBS News program &quot;60
Minutes&quot; aired a story which concluded that acid rain posed
little environmental threat.  The program quoted scientists who
refused to justify the $4 to $7 billion cost of an acid rain control
program that Congress had passed earlier
in the year.
<P>
 <li>In March 1993, the <I>New
York Times</I> published &quot;What Price Cleanup?&quot; a five-part
series that asserted &quot;many scientists, economists and Government
officials have reached the dismaying conclusion that much of America's
environmental program has gone seriously awry&quot; because &quot;environmental
policy has too often evolved largely in reaction to popular panics,
not in response to sound scientific analyses of which environmental
hazards pose the greatest risks.&quot;  The series challenged
the Superfund program, the reliability of animal
tests to assess chemical risk, and the need for a ban on ocean
dumping, among other policies.
<P>
 <li> In November 1993, ABC
News' &quot;20/20&quot; documented how enforcement of the Endangered
Species Act devastated some Riverside County, California homeowners.
 To protect the endangered Stephens'
Kangaroo Rat, homeowners were forbidden to clear firebreaks around
their homes.  When fires swept through the county in 1993, 29
homes (and rat habitat) were lost.
<P>
 <li>In December 1993, <I>U.S.
News &amp; World Report</I> published an in-depth look at &quot;The
Doomsday Myths&quot;--fear of species extinction and overpopulation.
 The story's conclusion: &quot;Environmentalists' penchant for
doomsaying is coming back to haunt them.&quot;
<P>
 <li>In April 1994, a highly-rated
ABC
News special  &quot;Are We Scaring Ourselves to Death?&quot; showed
how the federal Superfund program actually <I>increased</I> the
risk to public health and safety.  An abandoned Colorado silver
mine called Smuggler Mountain was designated
a federal Superfund site in 1986.  Though there
was no evidence that local residents were in danger, the federal
cleanup plan called for the physical dislocation of 150 homes
so that four feet of dirt could be removed from the site.  Local
leaders opposed the EPA plan, and one doctor told ABC, &quot;If
you want to save lives in this valley, build us a new road.  Our
road is what kills people.&quot;
<P>
 <li>In September 1994, the <I>Los
Angeles Times</I> ran a three-part series, &quot;Living Scared:
Why Do the Media Make Life Seem So Risky?&quot; on the &quot;cry-wolf&quot;
stories that dominate media coverage of the environment.  The
series' headline declared &quot;We're safer and healthier than
ever--and also more afraid of what we eat, drink and breathe.
 Why the reality gap?  Too often, critics say, the media's coverage
fuels our fears.&quot;
<P>
</ul>
 These stories criticize failed government environmental policies
and the nonprofit lobbying organizations that helped put them
in place.  NRDC senior
attorney David Hawkins said as much on &quot;60
Minutes&quot;: &quot;The environmental community has spent almost
no effort attempting to even monitor the progress&quot; of government-sponsored
acid rain research.  Instead, &quot;we have been working on trying
to get legislation in Washington.&quot;
<P>
 Public dissatisfaction with &quot;regulate first, ask questions
later&quot; policies is growing.  In 1991, only 28 percent of
the American public thought environmental groups exaggerated threats
&quot;in order to get the public to pay attention to them.&quot;
 By 1994, the number was 42 percent.
<P>
 Yet although many policy experts and the public now recognize
the failings of much environmental policy, Washington's environmental
lobbies are unyielding.  &quot;We don't need a new paradigm&quot;
said David Doniger, a senior attorney at the Natural
Resources Defense Council who later joined the Clinton
White House.  Fifteen environmental groups that participated
in a joint fundraising appeal opposed any efforts to reform existing
environmental laws and called instead for their strengthening.
 Leaders of the groups typically have attributed public dissatisfaction
to bad publicity and poor public education, not inadequacies in
policy.  &quot;Our business is basically communications and we've
lost the imagination of the guy on the street,&quot; says Ted
Lee Eubanks of the National
Audubon Society.
<P>
 The <I>New York Times</I> series, &quot;What
Price Cleanup?&quot;, was particularly threatening to environmentalists.
 Keith Schneider, the lead author of the
series, was called a mouthpiece for polluting corporations in
a September 1993 article in <I>Sierra</I>, the magazine
of the Sierra Club.  An official
of the Hudson County Sierra
Club earlier published similar charges, as had former Greenpeace
analyst Peter Montague, founder and director
of the Environmental
Research Foundation.  One year later, the National
Wildlife Federation published &quot;The Truth About Dioxin&quot;
in the pages of <I>National Wildlife</I>.
 It too charged Schneider with inaccuracy, but provided little
substantive documentation.
<P>
 These stories side-stepped Schneider's main point--that environmental
regulations cost a lot and produce little.  Instead, they targeted
Schneider's sources--corporate executives or scientists who received
corporate research funding--and the alleged interest of corporations
like the <I>Times</I> in underplaying the risks of dioxin and
other chemicals.  Schneider replied in his own defense: &quot;By
trying to portray others as enemies, and by failing to understand
the cultural shifts in understanding in the U.S., the national
environmentalists have become an enemy of the very programs, policies
and laws they themselves espouse.&quot;<BR>
</SUP>
<P><a name="env"></a>
<B>ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES IN THE POLLING BOOTH</B>
<P>
 The election returns of 1994 are one gauge of public attitudes.
 Polls show that voters support strong environmental protection,
but they also elect candidates who campaign for regulatory reform.
<P>
<ul>
 <li>The Endangered
Species Act was a central issue in the Texas Governor's race between
incumbent Ann Richards and challenger
George W. Bush, Jr.  Two Bush radio
ads attacked Richards for not working hard enough to protect property
owners' rights.  Attempting to save Richards from defeat, the <!--Clinton (Bill) Administration,-->Clinton
Administration announced that it would not restrict development
in central Texas to protect habitat for the golden-cheeked warbler.
<P>
 <li>In Pennsylvania, successful gubernatorial
candidate Tom Ridge campaigned against
costly federal air pollution control mandates on the state that
included more stringent new car emission standards and a requirement
that automakers sell electric cars.
<P>
 <li>In Oklahoma, Representative Mike
Synar was defeated in the Democratic primary
&quot;in part because of his steadfast support for tougher rules
on a range of environmental issues.&quot;  Other
environmental allies, including Representatives Dan Hamburg
(D-CA), Dan Glickman (D-KS), Karen Shepard
(D-UT), Tom Andrews (D-ME), Karan English
(D-AZ) and Senator Jim Sasser (D-TN) also
lost their seats.  Of 15 legislators whose reelection was a priority
for the League of Conservation
Voters, seven lost.
<P>
 <li>New freshmen were elected on
platforms to reform or repeal laws like the Endangered
Species and Clean Water Acts. 
They include Republicans Ed Brant of Tennessee,
Helen Chenoweth of Idaho, Wes Cooley
of Ohio, John Shadegg of Arizona, Linda
Smith of Washington, and William &quot;Mac&quot;
Thornberry of
Texas.  Indiana voters elected David McIntosh,
the former executive director of Vice President Dan Quayle's
Council on Competitiveness,
an agency that infuriated environmental lobbyists with its deregulatory
initiatives.<BR>
</ul>
<P><a name="unholy"></a>
<B>THE &quot;UNHOLY TRINITY&quot;</B>
<P>
 Dissatisfaction with much current government environmental regulation
centers on three issues--risk assessment, unfunded mandates, and
property rights.  They have been dubbed the &quot;unholy trinity&quot;
or the &quot;triple threat&quot; by environmental lobbyists. 
Environmental groups consider them the greatest threat to their
legislative and regulatory agendas, short of wholesale budget
cuts or the repudiation of government regulation as an environmental
protection strategy.
<P>
<ul>
<li><I>Risk
Assessment</I>--The premise underlying much federal environmental
regulation is that people's lives can be made safer by eliminating
or reducing human exposure to any number of dangerous substances--from
industrial air emissions to household chemicals.  But instead
of focusing on genuine, i.e., scientifically demonstrable, threats
to public health and safety,  the regulatory process often targets
risks that the public fears most or that have public relations
or political value.  Federal agencies spend millions
of dollars that do comparatively little to improve public health
and environmental quality.  According to analysts at Harvard's
School of Public Health, the cost-per-life-saved of the average
EPA regulation--over $7.5
million--is 87 times higher than the cost-per-life-saved of an
average regulation issued by the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration.  Moreover, some
federal regulations make the questionable scientific assumption
that any dose of a substance found to be toxic in certain dosages
and under certain conditions must therefore always be considered
dangerous to human health.  But a central principle of toxicology
is &quot;the dose makes the poison.&quot;
<P>
 Critics of agencies like EPA
are demanding more openness about the methods used to draft environmental
regulations.  They say that decisionmaking would improve if agencies
had to rely on peer-reviewed science and conducted cost-benefit
analysis of proposed regulations.  &quot;Such analysis permits
comparison of various options, all of which may be beneficial
in some way, but not all of which can be simultaneously taken,&quot;
explains environmental analyst Kent Jeffreys.
<P>
 Some environmentalists agree in principle.  According to former
National Audubon Society president
Peter Berle, &quot;Clearly it is a useful
way of establishing priorities.  We've got to ask ourselves whether
[policies] make sense from a cost point of view.&quot;
 Nonetheless, all major environmental groups formally oppose requiring
agencies to perform risk assessments and cost-benefit analyses
on the grounds that such analyses are &quot;pseudo-scientific.&quot;
<P>
 <li><I>Unfunded
Mandates</I>--Congress creates an &quot;unfunded mandate&quot;
when it passes a law that requires state or local governments
to meet goals or create programs, but fails to provide the money
for its implementation.  Under pressure to reduce the federal
deficit, Congress has increasingly relied
on them to meet environmental goals.
<P>
 State and local officials naturally oppose unfunded mandates
because their local priorities must be subordinated to Washington's
dictates.  Currently, it is estimated that up to 12 percent of
municipal revenues are spent to comply with unfunded mandates
of all sorts.  Local concerns are well-articulated by Michael
J. Pompilli, head of the environmental
health division of the Columbus, Ohio,
Health Department: &quot;What bothers me is that the new rules
coming out of Washington are taking money from decent programs
and making me waste them on less important problems.  It kills
you as a city official to see this kind of money spent for nothing.&quot;
<P>
 <li><I>Property
Rights</I>--Many environmental regulations override private land-use
decisions.  For example, the Fish
&amp; Wildlife Service will routinely deny property owners use
of their land if endangered species are present.  Policies to
protect wetlands and scenic rivers also supersede private property
rights.
<P>
 Many landowners say these policies violate the &quot;takings
clause&quot; of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S.
Constitution, which states &quot;. . . nor shall private property
be taken for public use without just compensation.&quot;  Property
rights advocates would reinvigorate this provision of the Bill
of Rights.  If the public wants to protect endangered species
or preserve a scenic vista, they say the public should be willing
to pay for it, just as it pays for highways, military bases, parks,
and other &quot;public goods.&quot;
<P>
</ul>
 Washington environmental lobbyists steadfastly oppose risk assessment,
relief from unfunded mandates, and greater protection of property.
 Thus, the Natural Resources
Defense Council announced that opposing such proposals would be
its &quot;single most important environmental campaign ever.&quot;
 The Sierra Club's executive director calls
these three issues &quot;pure and simple, an overt and calculated
attack on the environment,&quot; and &quot;an assault on the guiding
principle of virtually all laws governing air, water, and waste
disposal.&quot;  Most Americans, however, do not
appear to agree.  Indeed, many support these reforms while strongly
favoring environmental protection.  To most Americans, the two
are not incompatible.

<P><a name="envi"></a>
<B>ENVIRONMENTAL BACKLASH AND THE 103RD CONGRESS</B>
<P>
 The extent of the backlash against environmentalists can be seen
in the record of the 103rd Congress (1993-1994).  As environmentalists
see it, that Congress was an unmitigated
disaster.  The League of
Conservation Voters rated it the worst in 25 years.  Although
environmental lobbyists expected much from a Democratic President
and Congress, only one notable bill was signed into law, the California
Desert Protection Act.  Despite environmentalist cries of urgency,
Congress was unable to reauthorize several expired environmental
laws.
<P>
 Partisan gridlock is how pundits have explained Congressional
inaction: Republicans and conservative Democrats from the South
and West blocked good bills to placate industry lobbyists or for
partisan advantage.  EPA
Administrator Carol Browner told journalists,
&quot;What we've run into is gridlock and obstructionism that
is truly unprecedented.&quot;
<P>
 This argument may work in other areas, but not for environmental
legislation.  Little was attempted on the House
or Senate floor that culminated in gridlock.
 Rather, back room agreements were reached between influential
liberal legislators and the representatives of Washington's largest
environmental groups that doomed passage of the reauthorization
bills that environmentalists claimed they wanted.
<P>
 In February 1994, the representatives of six major environmental
groups--the Natural Resources
Defense Council, the Sierra Club, the National
Audubon Society, the National
Wildlife Federation, the Friends of
the Earth, and the Environmental
Defense Fund--met with California Democratic Representatives George
Miller, then-chairman of the House
Natural Resources Committee, and Henry Waxman,
then-chairman of the Environment
subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, to discuss
legislative strategy.  Because they anticipated that serious efforts
would be made to attach &quot;unholy trinity&quot; amendments
to upcoming environmental legislation, the lobbyists decided it
was better to hold off on consideration of any important environmental
bills.  They thought they had the strength to stop bills from
moving, but not enough to defeat the hostile amendments.  As Jim
Maddy, former president of the League
of Conservation Voters later explained, &quot;The best we can
do is prevent Congress from weakening the Clean
Water Act, prevent this Congress from weakening Superfund,
prevent this Congress from weakening the Safe
Drinking Water Act and prevent this Congress from weakening the
Endangered Species Act.&quot;
<P>
 This decision was documented in an extremely controversial memo
leaked on Capitol Hill in March 1994.  Written by
the NRDC's chief lobbyist,
Erik Olson, the memo outlined &quot;the legislative
agenda for this Congress&quot; on environmental issues as determined
at the lobbyists' meeting with Miller and Waxman.  The memo explained
that &quot;kill strategies&quot; were to be adopted for environmental
legislation that was susceptible to amendments of the kind that
the memo labeled &quot;unholy trinity.&quot;  Reauthorization
of the nation's solid waste law--the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA--and the Endangered
Species Act were to be &quot;taken off the table.&quot;  A &quot;kill
strategy&quot; was also intended for the reauthorization of the
Clean Water Act.  National
Audubon Society vice president Brock Evans
later described the strategy: &quot;We are slowing down on some
of our agenda because it is just too risky to reauthorize the
<!--Endangered Species Act of 1973,-->Endangered Species Act,
for example, with all these amendments locked into it.&quot;
<P>
 The only bill the group decided to allow on the floor was the
reauthorization of the Safe Drinking
Water Act.  Because it applies primarily to municipal water systems,
the lobbyists presumed it would attract less industry interest
and would more easily be kept free of reform amendments.  Yet
Olson and the others did not appreciate the
extent of opposition to their agenda.  They did not realize that
their primary opponent was no longer industry.  As one Senate
staffer explained, the &quot;primary adversary on many of these
issues isn't the National
Association of Manufacturers--it's the National
Governors' Association.&quot;
<P>
 As a result of the miscalculation the strategy failed.  The Senate
approved hostile unholy trinity amendments and proceeded to pass
the Safe Drinking Water Act reauthorization
by a large margin.  Even though a &quot;clean&quot; bill emerged
from the House, environmental
lobbyists recognized that an agreement with the Senate to strip
the offending provisions could not be reached and opted to let
the bill die before a House-Senate conference rather than allow
it to be enacted into law.  Thus even a relatively non-controversial
bill--it passed by wide majorities in both Houses of Congress--was
killed by environmental lobbyists opposed to the &quot;unholy
trinity.&quot;
<P>
 Environmental lobbyists have blamed this and other failures on
special interest groups who &quot;profit from pollution and from
exploiting public lands and resources.&quot;  A joint letter,
characterized as a &quot;Fourth of July 'wakeup call',&quot; was
signed by fifteen environmental lobbying organizations.  They
charged that &quot;At every turn, members of Congress are getting
more pressure from those who want to weaken environmental laws
than from those who want to strengthen them.&quot;
 The letter, sent to 400,000 people on the mailing lists of the
participating groups, was meant to revive grass roots activism
and offered a &quot;citizen action guide&quot; with counter-arguments
on &quot;unholy trinity&quot; issues.  One House aide explained
the approach, &quot;Without local-level support, there's no reason
for congressional moderates to vote with the environment.&quot;
<P>
 Neither lack of effort nor misallocation of resources explains
why the environmental movement failed to pass its legislative
agenda.  Rather, the leaders of environmental groups misunderstood
public sentiment.  Looking at polling data showing broad support
for environmental protection, they assumed the public must support
the agenda of the National
Wildlife Federation, the Sierra Club and the
League of Conservation Voters.
 But the same polls often show public support for reforms such
as the compensation of property owners for the adverse impact
of land-use regulations intended to protect wetlands or endangered
species.
<P>
 Environmentalists do not see that the public's interest in economic
common sense and fairness is compatible with support for a clean
environment.  Senate
Environment Committee staffer Michael Evans
tried explaining this at a seminar organized by the League
of Conservation Voters: &quot;Each of [the &quot;unholy trinity&quot;]
issues embodies a core truth.  It's important for you to concede
the truth, embrace it.  That's what's happening on the other side.
 They concede the principle of environmental protection, and they
talk about the need to prioritize resources.&quot;<BR>

<P><a name="increasing"></a>
<B>INCREASING PUBLIC DISSATISFACTION</B>
<P>
 Environmentalism's political failures coincide with a decline
in public support for Washington's environmental establishment.
 Since 1990, the ten largest environmental groups have lost members
and their annual revenues have been stagnant.  After a decade
of tremendous expansion, the ten largest groups--Ducks
Unlimited, the Environmental
Defense Fund, Greenpeace, Inc., the National
Audubon Society, the National
Parks and Conservation Association, the National
Wildlife Federation, the Sierra Club, the Nature
Conservancy, the Wilderness Society,
and the World Wildlife Fund--saw their
collective membership drop 6.5 percent from 1990 to 1993.
 &quot;It was easy for environmental groups to raise money&quot;
in the 1970s and 1980s, explains Dan <!--Borochoff, Dan,-->Borochoff
of the <!--American Institute of Philanthropy,-->American Institute
of Philanthropy, &quot;Now they're having to justify themselves
more.&quot;
<P>
 Worse, the problems are not just financial.  &quot;The green
groups also are faced with widespread cynicism about institutions
in general&quot; and public distrust of Washington, D.C.
 When Cindy Gabriel learned that former
National Wildlife Federation
president Jay Hair,  earned over $230,000 per year,
she told <I>The </I><I>Wall Street
Journal</I> she probably would quit the organization.
 If she saw the salaries of the other environmental C.E.O.s, Ms.
Gabriel might never contribute again to a national environmental
lobbying group.  Many environmental leaders are paid like high-powered
inside-the-beltway lobbyists, which is what they have become:
<P>
 <ul>
<li> Jay D. Hair
(former president), National
Wildlife Federation ($242,060);
<P>
<li>Fred Krupp,
Environmental Defense Fund ($213,504);
<P>
 <li> Kathryn Fuller,
<!--World Wildlife Fund,-->World Wildlife Fund ($185,000);
<P>
<li> Peter A.A. Berle
(former president), National Audubon
Society ($171,154);
<P>
<li> Karin Sheldon,
Wilderness Society ($90,896);
<P>
<li> Carl Pope,
Sierra Club ($77,142);
<P>
<li> Barbara Dudley,
Greenpeace ($65,000).
</ul>
<P>
 Left-liberal critics like writers for <I>The </I><I>Nation</I>
take particular exception: &quot;The mainstream high brass is
elitist, highly paid, detached from the people, indifferent to
the working class and a firm ally of big government.&quot;
 A recent controversy inside the Sierra Club
about logging in the Northern Rockies is illustrative.  Local
chapters in Montana and other states have called for an end to
logging on federal lands there.  But the Sierra Club's national
leadership has opposed such a blanket policy, and responded by
threatening to depose local elected officials.  &quot;What we
are seeing here is how an environmental organization becomes a
bureaucracy,&quot; said Andy Mahler, a Sierra
Club member in Indiana.  &quot;The higher up in the organization
you go, the impulse is to protect each other, to protect funding,
to protect political access rather than take a stand.&quot;
<P>
 A study from the Center
for the Study of American Business confirms the suspicion that
environmental organizations have become more bureaucratic over
the past two decades.  Authors Christopher Boerner
and Jennifer Chilton Kallery
find that staffs at the major groups have skyrocketed since 1970.
 The most rapid growth occurred in the 1980s, with many employees
working in fundraising and membership development.  Some groups
may devote as much as 25 percent of revenues to fundraising and
20 percent more to membership development.  &quot;Such hefty investments
in promotion and development by [some] environmental groups have
almost certainly been primary contributors to their growth over
the last fifteen years,&quot; they note.
<P>
 Dave Foreman, a former Wilderness
Society lobbyist and founder of Earth First!
and The Wildlands Project speaks with
characteristic fervor:<BR>

<P>
<blockquote> As in most business, government, and citizen organizations,
the technicians--accountants, lawyers, public-relations-experts,
and political pros--have taken over from the idealists. . . .
 Political operatives, not conservationists, are sought for jobs
with environmental groups. . . .  A salaried elite has formed
that elevates itself above the volunteers.
</blockquote>
<P>
 This concern is summed up by Bill Gifford
and the editors of <I>Outside</I> magazine: &quot;If
only some of the larger groups didn't have vast bureaucracies,
publicity machines, and presidents like the National
Wildlife Federation's Jay Hair, who is accustomed
to being squired about by a chauffeur.&quot;
<P>
 When the <I>Chronicle of Philanthropy</I>
polled attitudes toward charity it found that no environmental
organization made the public's list of the twenty &quot;Best Liked&quot;
or &quot;Most Credible&quot; charitable causes.
But the twenty &quot;Most Opposed&quot; groups included Greenpeace
(6th), the Sierra Club (12th), and the Environmental
Defense Fund (20th).  Among the twenty &quot;Least Credible&quot;
were the same three organizations--7th, 14th, and 18th--and Friends
of the Earth Foundation (19th).  Greenpeace,
the National Audubon Society and
the Sierra Club were also on the list of top
twenty &quot;never donated to&quot; charitable causes.  Similarly,
a poll conducted by <!--American Forests,--><I>American Forests</I>
found that in the northwestern United States environmentalists
are less trusted than timber industry scientists.
<P>
 Changing public attitudes toward environmental lobbyists hurts
some groups more than others.  Four groups have been hit hard
by falling memberships and revenues: the Sierra
Club, the National Audubon Society,
the Wilderness Society, and Greenpeace.
<P>
<ul>
<li> <I>Sierra
Club</I>--From 1990 to 1993, membership fell from almost 630,000
to 500,000.  In one year, 1992-1993, membership dropped
15 percent.  Sierra has accumulated deficits of almost
$3 million since 1990.  The Sierra Club recently announced plans
to reduce its coverage of policy issues.  In 1995, it will focus
on pollution prevention and scenic preservation, and drop work
on population issues, energy conservation and other issues.  The
Club plans to cut its budget by $3.7 million and lay off 350 employees.
 As Sierra Club executive director Carl <!--Pope, Carl,-->Pope
explained, &quot;We had been spending our reserves but no longer
felt this was prudent.&quot;
<P>
<li><I>National
Audubon Society</I>--Membership dropped by 8 percent from 1992
to 1993, and donations also slipped slightly.  Membership
growth has waned since Audubon refashioned its image as an activist
group.  In 1993, it ran a $1.7 million deficit. 
Audubon officials hope to balance their budget by 1996.
<P>
<li><I>Wilderness
Society</I>--Membership plummeted by nearly a third between 1990
and 1993 and finances dropped by $2.9 million--almost
one-sixth.  Field offices were closed in Oregon,
Utah, and Maine.  Society staffers &quot;now must plunk down a
quarter for office coffee.&quot;
<P>
<li><I>Greenpeace</I>--In
1990, Greenpeace had approximately 2.5 million members, but membership
has dropped by 800,000.  Greenpeace's funding dropped
by nearly a third in 1991.  Revenues for Greenpeace
dropped by nearly 10 percent more between 1992 and 1993,
forcing the group to lay off 100 staff members.  Explains Greenpeace's
development director, David <!--Lemos, David,-->Lemos, &quot;We
had gotten used to having a lot more money.&quot;
</ul>
<P>
 Not all environmental groups have done poorly in the 1990s. 
The Environmental Defense Fund
(EDF) had increases in membership (25 percent) and revenues (6
percent) between 1992 and 1993.  The World
Wildlife Fund (WWF) lost 7 percent of its members during the period,
but revenues increased 10 percent.  Donations may
not be dramatically increasing at the Nature
Conservancy (TNC), but <I>Outside</I> magazine
characterizes its finances as &quot;cash-flow heaven.&quot;
<P>
 EDF, WWF and TNC benefit from perceptions of them as more conservative
than other environmental advocacy organizations.  Bush EPA chief
William Reilly was tapped from the ranks
of WWF, and the Administration's 1990 Clean
Air Act proposal borrowed heavily from the work of EDF.  Unlike
most environmental groups, TNC eschews high-profile lobbying campaigns.
 To promote conservation, it directs most of its resources towards
the purchase of lands and easements.
<P>
 Still, the fortunes of environmental groups may be tied, at least
in part, to the health of the economy.  Charitable giving tends
to increase in times of economic prosperity.  &quot;Giving by
individuals and corporations jumped dramatically in the 1980s&quot;
explains economist Richard B. McKenzie.
 Private charitable giving, which increased by less than 3.5 percent
per year from 1955 to 1980, increased over 5.1 percent annually
during the 1980s, from $77.5 billion in 1980 to over $120 billion
in 1989.  When the economy slowed in 1989, the rise in charitable
giving came to a standstill and began to rise only after the economy
picked-up in 1991.
<P>
 This trend certainly affects the finances of environmental groups.
 Boerner and Kallery
found a correlation between per capita GNP and organizational
membership and revenue when they examined the Wilderness
Society, Sierra Club, National
Audubon Society, Natural
Resources Defense Council and the Nature
Conservancy.  Moreover, polling data showed that
support for environmental policy tracks economic concerns.  A
1992 survey found that 80 percent of the public agreed with the
statement &quot;protecting the environment is so important that
requirements and standards cannot be too high, and continuing
environmental improvements must be made regardless of cost.&quot;
 Yet in 1993, only 58 percent agreed with the statement.<SUP>67</SUP>
<P>
 Another factor is political leadership.  Environmentalists certainly
credit Reagan Interior Secretary James Watt
and EPA Administrator Anne Gorsuch for their
own good fortune in fundraising.  As the radical <I>Nation</I>
columnist Alexander Cockburn and <I>Wild
Forest Review</I> editor Jeffrey St.
Clair argue: &quot;The venal but entirely harmless Watt was a
bankbook extravaganza to the mainstream environmental groups,
who sold him as Genghis incarnate.  Memberships doubled, budgets
tripled.  Everyone packed up, hired C.E.O.s at six-figure salaries
and moved to spacious quarters in D.C.&quot;
<P>
 The <I>Exxon Valdez</I> spill also filled
environmentalist coffers.  The dramatic spill off Alaska's coast
&quot;just really presented an opportunity,&quot; said Keller
Ries of the National
Wildlife Federation.  In 1990 membership for some groups, such
as Greenpeace and the Sierra
Club, peaked.  &quot;We're in the ironic situation where possibly
the nation's greatest environmental catastrophe ever is causing
this increased interest in environmental organizations,&quot;
noted Robert SanGeorge of the National
Audubon Society.
<P>
 The reverse may be happening now.  Susan Carson,
a former National Audubon Society
staffer told <I>The </I><I>Wall Street
Journal</I> that environmental groups are suffering from the &quot;Gore
effect.&quot;  &quot;The basic theory is that with Gore and Clinton
in power, the environmental shtick is being handled,&quot; she
says.  Environmental leaders think both economics
and politics are at work.  &quot;The No. 1 cause of our problems
has been the economy,&quot; said Ben Beach,
a Wilderness Society spokesman.  &quot;When
the economy went down, so did our membership.  The election of
Clinton and Gore
also didn't help.  Some people believed there was less need to
support environmental causes.&quot;
<P>
 Environmental groups have begun demonizing their opponents to
revive their sources of support.  The July 1994 joint fundraising
appeal signed by fifteen groups charged that &quot;even during
the Reagan / Watt / Gorsuch years, we have never faced such a
serious threat to our environmental laws in Congress.&quot;  Since
the November 1994 election, the rhetoric has sharpened.  Wilderness
Society president Jon Roush signed a fundraising
appeal claiming that &quot;Today, the Wilderness Society must
adapt to a new climate that flings storms of opposition against
our efforts to conserve America's precious natural heritage.&quot;
 The Sierra Club labeled the regulatory reform
proposals in the Republican &quot;Contract
With America&quot; a &quot;polluter's bill of rights&quot; and
an undeclared &quot;war on the environment.&quot;
<P>
 Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, a former
President of the League of
Conservation Voters, explained the fundraising tactics of environmental
lobbying organizations.<BR>

<P>
<blockquote> The bottom line for the environmentalists is how
do you induce people to send money to sustain the movement. .
. .  For years and years, they said, &quot;James Watt is out to
destroy life on Earth as we know it--send money.&quot;  &quot;The
Exxon Valdez just crashed--send money.&quot;  The game has changed.
 It's a lot harder now to begin the sentence that ends with &quot;Send
money.&quot;
</blockquote>
<P>
<B>OUTLINE</B>
<P>
 The environmental movement is at a crossroads.  Once environmental
groups made consistent strides towards ambitious policy objectives.
 Today, environmentalists are running into a brick wall.  Assorted
items on the environmentalist agenda face a variety of opponents
in statehouses and in the U.S. Congress,
and green fundraising has started to lag.  Can America's environmental
establishment overcome its recent failures?  Or will American
environmentalism take a new course?
<P>
 This book will survey recent developments that are affecting
environmental groups.  They are suffering declining memberships,
declining political fortunes, and the challenge posed by a so-called
&quot;environmental backlash.&quot;  But they remain a formidable
power in the world of Washington special interest lobbies.
<P>
 Chapter One reviews the &quot;first wave&quot; of environmental
groups--the conservation organizations that focused on land, resource
and wildlife conservation.  It examines their increasing reliance
on centralized federal regulation and government land ownership
to achieve their objectives.
<P>
 Chapter Two focuses on the &quot;second wave&quot; of groups
that were, almost literally, the products of Earth
Day 1970.  These groups were activists from the start, and they
launched the environmental movement's attack on modern industrial
society and its assault on the use of chemicals and advanced technologies.
<P>
 Chapter Three is on international environmentalism, from the
concept of &quot;sustainable development&quot; to the push for
population control.  The growing presence of American environmental
groups in the international arena is explored.
<P>
 Chapter Four analyzes the role environmental groups play in developing
public policies and shaping public opinion on environmental issues.
 It includes a look at the environmental curriculum in the schools
and discusses how environmental lobbyists exert influence in the
Clinton Administration.
<P>
 Chapter Five surveys where environmental groups get financial
support--from individuals, foundations and corporations--and describes
how environmental groups are trying to diversify their funding
base through government grants and the sale of commercial products.
<P>
 Chapter Six discusses emerging movements within environmentalism:
from the deep ecology movement and the environmental justice movement
to free market environmentalism and the property rights and &quot;wise-use&quot;
environmental backlash.
<P>
 Finally, appendices analyze the largest and most influential
environmental organizations operating in America today, their
sources of income, officers, and most important activities.<BR>

<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<i>The Rise of the Nanny
State</i> examines the origins, goals, and activities of the modern
consumer movement--a movement that, in the words of Capital Research
Center Visiting Fellow Tom Holt, &quot;does not address the needs
of consumers.  
<P>
Instead, it serves the bureaucratic interests of
governing elites and the ideological and organizational interests
of the movement itself.&quot; Holt paints a decidedly unflattering
portrait of the consumer movement.  As the recent Alar scare showed,
consumer advocates capitalize on the public's ignorance of science
and the media's eagerness for calamity.  Under the guise of public
health and safety, they seek to justify regulations dictating
their idea of the public good to our households and workplaces.
<P>
 With few exceptions, they advocate bigger and more intrusive
government and are hostile to free markets and personal responsibility.
Holt shows that the consumer movement has imposed significant
costs on industry--costs ultimately passed on to consumers--and
has violated individual freedoms in a futile effort to protect
us from our own actions and judgment.  Based on his analysis,
he calls for: major tort reform; the abolition of CAFE standards
and the Delaney clause; a reduced federal role in health care;
a major overhaul of the Consumer Product Safety Commission; and
other reforms of regulatory agencies.

<h2> Executive Summary</h2>

<h3> Recommendations for the Future of the Fulbright Program</h3>
<P>
<ul>
 Policymakers need to critically re-examine the future role of
the Federal Government in sponsoring the Fulbright program of
international educational exchanges.  They will want to recognize
the program's very real accomplishments over the past half century.
 But they should question the contribution the Fulbright program
can make in a post-Cold War world.  And they should ask whether
that contribution is a national interest requiring government
funding.  This report recommends a substantial reevaluation
of the nature of the program and cites various changes that would
both continue the most valuable elements of the existing program,
while at the same time share its costs more equitably with other
countries and the academic community.
<P>
<B> 1.  Freeze Spending.</B>  The new Congress initially should
freeze spending on the Fulbright program at the existing level
and plan for a gradual reduction in future funding.  International
educational exchange is no longer a new idea requiring nurture.
 Programs that make possible overseas travel by hundreds of thousands
of scholars and students are well established throughout the world.
 It is no longer necessary to organize these programs under government
auspices and sponsorship.  As in so many other areas, private
and nonprofit institutions in civil society are the most appropriate
providers of institutional and financial support.  
<P>
 However, the Fulbright program is a prestigious program that
has been established by mutual agreements with other countries,
including our major allies and trading partners.  Consequently,
the program should continue, but grant awards should be limited
and they should be sustained in most countries by mutual and equivalent
levels of financial support.  During the past 48 years the U.S.
has provided $1.67 billion in Fulbright funding.  The time has
come to redesign the Fulbright program.  A program intended to
establish mutual understanding that is mutually beneficial should
be mutually supported.
<P>
<B> 2.  Require Foreign Contribution Levels Equal to U.S. Government
Support.</B>  Fifty binational commissions administer most of
the major Fulbright exchanges and they have made overseas Fulbright
programs a genuine collaborative endeavor.  But the mutual role
of U.S. and foreign counterparts in administering the program
should be accompanied, in most instances, by equivalent binational
financing.  
<P>
 Currently only ten countries contribute as much financial support
to the program as the United States.  The Fulbright program should
welcome an emphasis on mutuality with Western Europe, Japan and
other nations able to support joint exchanges.  Many governments,
including those of the so-called newly industrialized countries
of Asia, spend enormous sums to sponsor their students in the
United States.  Indeed, foreign governments pay about 5 percent
of the costs of all foreign students in the U.S.  They should
be willing to transfer some of these resources to the Fulbright
program.  By raising their contributions, wealthy countries would
share with the U.S. the cost of the program. 
<P>
 If these countries are unwilling to provide support at levels
equivalent to U.S. support, then the United States should reduce
its contribution to parity.  In bilateral programs where cost-sharing
is equivalent or where the U.S. contribution is less than the
foreign counterpart, U.S. support levels should not be ratcheted
upward.  Some of the funds &quot;saved&quot; by cost-sharing adjustments
should be reallocated to programs targeting former Soviet bloc
states and other newly emerging nations in Africa, the Middle
East or South Asia that lack the resources to support international
educational exchanges.  U.S. government funding can be steadily
reduced as more countries contribute their share to the program.
<P>
<B> 3.  Tighten Oversight.</B>  The Board of Foreign Scholarships,
which has responsibility for the Fulbright program, should conduct
a comprehensive review of program operations.  In particular,
the Board should initiate discussions on the above-mentioned reallocation
of program resources and on developing ways to increase foreign
government and private sources of support.  The Board and USIA
should also consider ways to involve new segments of the American
academic community.  For instance, currently only seven percent
of scholar grants go to those teaching at liberal arts colleges
and two percent of grants go to community college teachers.  There
should also be more competition in selecting the contract agencies
that actually develop the mechanisms for the review and nomination
of Fulbright candidates.
<P>
<B> 4.  De-emphasize Western Europe.</B>  Western Europe should
be de-emphasized as a destination for American scholars and students.
 Instead, the regional emphasis should move east to the emerging
democracies of the former Warsaw Pact countires.  Resources currently
allocated to Western Europe should be shifted to Central and Eastern
Europe.  This is an area of vital interest to the United States
and one where governments lack the resources and historical connections
to develop educational exchanges with us.
<P>
<B> 5.  Give Priority to U.S. Students.</B>  In allocating financial
support the Fulbright program should give priority to American
graduate students pursuing overseas studies over American senior
scholars.  For every six foreign students in the United States
one American student goes overseas.  Very few American graduate
students pursue overseas educations in countries outside Europe.
 Here is an area where Fulbright grants can provide a real incentive.
 Such grants are far more likely to have an impact on young careers
than grants to senior scholars.  Senator Fulbright is reported
to have commented pointedly in 1987 at a Fulbright alumni conference
that he had initially conceived the program for graduate students,
not faculty with their &quot;whole damn families.&quot;    
<P>
<B> 6.  Encourage Fulbright Alumni Support.</B>  The prestige
of the Fulbright program depends on its history and its distinguished
alumni.  This constituency can continue to play an important role
in facilitating international exchanges in the future.  Prominent
former Fulbright award recipients can encourage foreign governments
and private sources to provide funding.  By anticipating reduced
U.S. government support, Fulbright alumni can help sustain a program
from which personally they have greatly benefitted.  Alumni groups
in foreign countries and in the U.S. should initiate funding for
national programs, as Japanese alumni did when they established
a scholarship endowment fund.
<P>
<B> 7.  Maintain USIA Information Services.</B>  Fulbright program
officials and related USIA offices overseas should continue to
play an important and impartial role providing information on
U.S. academic opportunities and on the many nongovernment programs
providing scholarship assistance to foreign students and scholars.
 USIA library resources of college catalogues and information
on application procedures are particularly valuable, especially
in Central and Eastern Europe. 
<P>
<B> 8.  Back to Core Values:  </B>The central value of the Fulbright
program from its inception has been the prestige it has given
to America by making possible high quality international scholar
and student exchanges.  The program should return to its historic
roots as a small and important program with a clear mission. 
The total number of grants may diminish, but the Fulbright program
can foster academic exchanges that would not otherwise occur,
especially in newly emerging democratic countries.  Just as the
Fulbright program contributed to the reconstruction of post-World
War II Europe fifty years ago, so can it assist today in the construction
of a post-Cold War world.

<B>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</B>
<P>
 
<P>
  How can those who wish to create a charitable foundation best
ensure that their wishes will be followed after their deaths?
<P>
 In this important and timely book, Martin Morse Wooster provides
a well-reasoned answer to this question, as well as a fascinating
overview of the individuals, ideas, and beliefs that inspired
the creation of some of America's largest foundations. In some
cases, the intentions of those who created great philanthropies
have been faithfully adhered to by trustees. Unfortunately, however,
in most cases those intentions have been either ignored or brazenly
violated. 
<P>
Drawing on an examination of foundations that have either followed
or rejected the beliefs and wishes of their founders, Wooster
outlines a set of principles that wealthy donors should bear in
mind when considering the creation of a foundation. Given that
the &quot;baby boom&quot; generation is expected to transfer an
estimated $8 to $10 trillion over the next few decades--and that
a good portion of this wealth may go to philanthropy--Wooster's
guidelines may serve to prevent donors from bequeathing wealth
in ways they would regret.

<B> INTRODUCTION</B>
<P>
 
<P>
 Two cultures of American anti-poverty philanthropy live upstairs
and downstairs from each other, sometimes meeting on the landings
but then moving off into different worlds and different world
views.
<P>
 We hear much about heavily funded, upstairs attempts to help
the poor through massive monetary intervention and political organization.
 Send dollars to anti-poverty organizations and provide housing
for the homeless, we are told, and all will be well.  Public relations
specialists guide the discontented and their genteel allies into
support of &quot;compassionate&quot; programs that provide healthy
salaries to those who direct them.
<P>
 We hear less about the downstairs culture that depends upon unpaid
or poorly-paid individuals spending hours of their weeks and years
of their lives in the truly compassionate activity of suffering
with those in need.  And what we hear is often overly-simplistic:
 the noble volunteer knight of the grassroots group slays the
dragon of poverty, and all live happily ever after.
<P>
 The reality is more complex.  Setting up new, downstairs programs
to combat poverty, or revitalizing stultified old ones, is hard.
 Cultural, economic and bureaucratic frustrations are often choking.
 The pioneers are sinner as well as saints, and they need to further
develop their own discipline as they seek to discipline others.
<P>
 Articles in <a href="/crc/pcs"><I>Philanthropy, Culture, and Society</I></a> over the
past three years have attempted to get at the reality.  From the
beginning, we de-emphasized theoretical essays and pressed for
descriptive reporting of both successes and failures.  Too often
those of us involved with foundations in one way or another tend
to sit at our computers and fund or write about good intentions,
without having paid our dues by pounding the pavements to find
out the reality.
<P>
 I became committed to the development of <I>Philanthropy, Culture,
and Society </I>three years ago when I attended an annual conference
of the Council on Foundations.  Two thousand foundation executives
and staff members met at the Chicago Hilton, historically -- according
to a hotel brochure -- &quot;the choice of visiting government
officials and royalty.&quot;
<P>
 Under sparkling chandeliers and surrounded by 22 karat gold leaf,
conference attendees heard about the need to help the homeless
by increasing funding for political efforts to change national
housing policy.  They contemplated such appeals while relaxing
in guest rooms &quot;richly appointed with traditional cherry
wood furnishings,&quot; according to a hotel brochure; attendees
washed their hands in bathrooms &quot;complete with gleaming brass
fixtures and lined with exquisite Italian marble.&quot;
<P>
 Attendees who really wanted to learn about homelessness, however,
could have learned far more by walking two blocks away, to the
Pacific Garden Mission.  Furnishings there were not ornate, but
the four-story mission did offer dormitories with &quot;sturdy
army-type beds&quot; for some 300 men and 40 women, with &quot;12
white porcelain showers for each floor,&quot; according to a mission
brochure.  The mission offered other amenities as well:  a guest
there placed &quot;his clothing on the hanger, which is hung for
the night in a delousing unit.&quot;
<P>
 Mirrored ballrooms at the conference were filled with rhetoric
about &quot;social change,&quot; &quot;justice,&quot; &quot;moving
toward a multicultural outlook,&quot; and &quot;accepting the
homeless as they are.&quot;  Plastic chairs on a linoleum floor
at the mission two blocks away were filled with 200 black, white
and Hispanic men and women who were in or had just come out of
the drug and alcohol culture, and their words were different:
 &quot;I praise God that He saved me from drugs,&quot; or &quot;I'm
living for drugs, I want to be free.&quot;
<P>
 The articles that follow avoid the mirrored ballrooms and concentrate
on the linoleum and the long twilight struggles that occur there.
 Some of the articles are generally positive, and others describe
the failure of attempts to merge the personal approach with government
dollars and a philanthropically correct vision of societal oppression.
 All are expressions of directed reporting:  each author appreciates
downstairs philanthropy and has pounded the pavements to describe
objective reality as accurately as he or she can.
<P>
 The articles, written by ten different authors, have several
common conclusions that I will summarize in an afterword.  But
the point of these varied articles is not simply to provide a
1-2-3 set of poverty-fighting techniques; for that, a textbook
would do as well.  Rather, these articles provide texture.  They
show the interplay of principles with hard practice.  They show
the importance of perseverance.
<P>
 Most western movies provide action but few memorable lines. 
My four sons and I the other day, however, were watching one of
the best, The Magnificent Seven (1961), which tells of how seven
Texas gunfighters come to the defense of a village that previously
had succumbed to a bandit gang.  We were struck by the words of
a gunfighter who is surrounded by a circle of admiring children.
 &quot;We are ashamed to live here,&quot; one boy says.  &quot;Our
fathers are cowards.&quot;
<P>
 The gunfighter replies, &quot;You think I am brave because I
carry a gun, but your fathers are much braver because they carry
responsibility for you, your brothers, your sisters, and your
mothers, and this responsibility is like a big rock that weighs
a ton.  It bends and twists them until finally it buries them
under the ground.  And there's nobody that says they have to do
this.  They do it because they love you and because they want
to.&quot;
<P>
 The gunfighter concludes, &quot;I have never had this kind of
courage, running a farm, working like a mule every day with no
guarantee what will ever come of it.  This is bravery.  It's why
I never even started anything like that.  It's why I never will.&quot;
 And the gunfighter is killed at the end of the film, but the
bandits are defeated and the village will be able to survive and
perhaps even thrive.
<P>
 Upstairs philanthropists think they will save our despondent
inner city villages of today by constructing some shining new
buildings and shiny new programs.  But downstairs philanthropists
seek out those people in the neighborhood who, faced with crime
and drugs and bad public schools, still try to be good citizens,
who raise their children properly.  If this responsibility were
removed, the residents would become mere drones, their lives full
of drudgery, without noble purpose.
<P>
 It is philanthropically correct to want massive government programs
that promise to transform society.  But downstairs philanthropy
says to the courageous, &quot;We honor your bravery.  We acknowledge
that though you are poor, you are doing vital work.  We will not
undermine your efforts by imposing our theories of social change.
 Instead, we will help you have safe streets and decent schools.
<P>
 &quot;We will help, not by depriving you of your purpose, but
by helping you bear the burden with dignity and a society's gratitude
-- and together, we will throw the bandits out.&quot;

          <H2>   <CENTER> Federal Court Finds Violence Against
                   Women Act Unconstitutional</CENTER></H2>

 <P>    In a case which has received national attention, Federal
Judge Jackson Kiser declared the Violence Against Women Act
(VAWA) unconstitutional.

<P>     VAWA, which passed as part of the omnibus crime bill of
1994, created a federal civil action for crimes motivated by
"discriminatory animus" against gender.  In passing VAWA,
Congress created a broad new federal tort for crimes which
traditionally have fallen under state jurisdiction.

<P>     In <EM>Brzonkala v. Virginia Polytechnic Institute</EM>, a
student at Virginia Tech filed suit under VAWA against two members of
the Virginia Tech football team--Antonio Morrison and James
Crawford--for
 an alleged rape.  A Virginia Federal Court found Friday that
Congress did not have constitutional authority to enact VAWA,
which if implemented would have the effect of "excessively
extending Congress's power and of inappropriately tipping the
balance [of power] away from the states."  Judge Kiser emphasized the
importance of the issues at stake in warning that "[Congress']
authority to act is limited by the Constitution, and the
constitutional limits must be respected if our federal system is to
survive."

<P>     The court's decision to strike down VAWA has the added
benefit of dismissing federal lawsuits against what by all
accounts are two innocent men.  Defendants Morrison and Crawford
were cleared of rape charges by both the Virginia Tech campus
disciplinary body and the state grand jury, yet still faced
federal VAWA charges for a complaint made over seven months after the
alleged rape, by an accuser who was unable to identify them
accurately.

 <P>    Michael E. Rosman, co-counsel for Antonio Morrison and
General Counsel for the Center for Individual Rights, stated that "We
are delighted with the outcome of this case and believe that Judge
Kiser's opinion, by dint of its reasoning and careful analysis, will
influence many courts on this same issue."  Mr. Morrison is also
represented by W. David Paxton and M. Christina Floyd of the Roanoke
firm of Gentry, Locke, Rakes & Moore.  Mr. Crawford is represented by
Joseph Graham Painter, Jr., a solo practioner in Blackbury, Virginia.

<P>     To receive a copy of the decision, or for more information
about the case, call Robert Alt, Director of Public Relations and
Education for the Center for Individual Rights, at 202-833-8400, ext.
101.

                         COMPLAINT

               NATURE AND SUMMARY OF THE ACTION

1. This is a civil action for declaratory and injunctive relief
arising from defendants' violation of plaintiff's constitutional
and civil rights and liberties under the United States
Constitution and federal law. 

2.   Plaintiff COLUMBIA UNION COLLEGE, a private college
affiliated with the Seventh-day Adventist Church, seeks:
  
(a)  a declaration that the conduct of the defendants in
applying and administering the Father Sellinger Program for
the State of Maryland, which denies plaintiff the same benefits
(including, but not limited to, eligibility to receive financial
aid paid to Maryland schools of higher education) granted other
similarly situated colleges and universities, and which denies
plaintiff such funds solely and expressly because of the content
or viewpoint of plaintiff's speech and beliefs, violates
plaintiffs rights to freedom of speech, freedom of association,
free exercise of religion, and to equal protection under the law,
as guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the
United States Constitution; 

(b)  a permanent order enjoining defendants from continuing to
apply a policy of discriminating against plaintiff in the
appropriation of Father Sellinger Program financial aid or in any
other manner on the basis of: the content or viewpoint of
plaintiff's speech and belief or on the basis of the content or
viewpoint of the speech of the Seventh-day Adventist Church with
which plaintiff is affiliated; its expression; its exercise of
religion; or its association;

(c)  such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

                       JURISDICTION

3.   This action arises under the First and Fourteenth
Amendments to the United States Constitution.  Jurisdiction
over the claims is conferred on this Court by 28 U.S.C. Sections
1331 and 1343, by 42 U.S.C. Sections 1983, and by 42 U.S.C.
Section 2000bb-l(c). Plaintiff brings this action pursuant to 42
U.S.C. Section 1983, and claims all available relief pursuant to
that statute, including attorneys' fees under 42 U.S.C. Section
1998.

                            VENUE

4. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Section
1391(b).

5. Plaintiff COLUMBIA UNION COLLEGE ("Columbia Union"), is a
private, four year college affiliated with the Seventh-day
Adventist Church located in Tacoma Park, Maryland in Montgomery
County.  Columbia Union was founded in 1904, and is and was at
all times relevant herein a four year college granting associate
and baccalaureate degrees in the liberal arts, sciences, and
certain professional fields.        

6.   Defendant the MARYLAND HIGHER EDUCATION COMMISSION (the

                      GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

23.  As provided for in the Code of Maryland, Education, Title
17, the Commission is charged with the authority to implement and
administer the Father Sellinger Program.  One of its
responsibilities is to receive and review applications for aid
and determine whether the institutions applying for aid are
eligible to receive Father Sellinger Program funds under the
criteria set forth in Md. Code Ann, Edu. Section 17-103.

24.  Md. Code Ann. Edu. Section 17-103 sets forth the following
eligibility requirements: 

1)  the institution must have been established prior to July 1,
1970; 2) it must be accredited by the State Department of
Education; 3) it must maintain more than one associate of arts or
baccalaureate degree programs; 4) it must submit for approval any
new programs or major alteration of programs to the Commission;
and 5) it must refrain from utilizing any of the money payable
under the Father Sellinger Program for sectarian purposes.

25.  Currently, and at all times relevant herein, the
Commission has set forth the guidelines and procedures for the
distribution of Father Sellinger Program funds to eligible
institutions.

26.  During the period relevant to this lawsuit, the Commission,
subject to the review of the Maryland Board of Public Works and
the recommendation of the Maryland Attorney General, regularly
distributed Father Sellinger Program Funds to colleges and
universities within Maryland.  Upon information and belief, this
practice dates back at least to 1957. 

27.  Upon information and belief, colleges and universities 
receiving Father Sellinger Program funds in the past have
included institutions that are affiliated with religions.  For
example, Mount St. Mary's College, Loyola University, and Notre
Dame College of Maryland have received Father Sellinger Program
funds and are affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church.  These
institutions are dedicated to the Catholic point of view and have
engaged in and continue to engage in sectarian activities and
expression. 

28.  In January 1990, Columbia Union submitted an application
to receive Father Sellinger Program funds to the Commission. 

29.  The application of Columbia Union for Father Sellinger
Program funds conformed with all applicable, content-neutral
Commission requirements.  In particular, Columbia Union was
established before July 1, 197O; it was then and is now
accredited by the State Department of Education; it maintains
numerous degree programs other than seminarian or theological
degrees; it agreed to submit any new programs or major program
alteration to the Commission for approval; and it agreed to use
Father Sellinger Program funds for non-sectarian purposes only.
                                
30.  On April 14, 1992, the Commission found that the college is
"pervasively sectarian" and denied Columbia Union's application
for aid. 

31.  The Commission offered no reason other than the alleged
status of Columbia Union as "pervasively sectarian" as a
basis to deny funding.

32.  On December 27, 1995, Dr. Charles Scriven, President of
Columbia Union, sought reconsideration of the Commission's
refusal to provide Columbia Union with Father Sellinger Program
Funds in light of the decision of the United States Supreme Court
in Rosenberger v. The Rector and Visitors at the University of
Virginia, 115 S. Ct. 2510 (1995).

33. On January 22, 1996, defendant William P. Howard, Assistant
Attorney General of Maryland, writing at the request of the
Commission, replied to Dr. Scriven's request, stating that
"unless the nature and practices of Columbia Union have changed
very substantially since 1992, I do not believe there would be
any point in pursuing a new application for private aid at this
time." 

34.  Defendants have denied, and, unless enjoined, will continue
to deny Father Sellinger Program funds to plaintiff solely and
expressly on the basis of plaintiff's viewpoint, content of its
expression, and the free exercise of religion by its faculty and
students. 

35.  Defendants cannot demonstrate a compelling interest
sufficient to justify the denial of Father Sellinger Program
funds to plaintiff, nor can defendants demonstrate that the
denial of funding is narrowly drawn to satisfy any such state
interest.

                     COUNT ONE: VIOLATION OF
                FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND ASSOCIATION

36.  The allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 35
am incorporated herein by this reference.

37.  Although defendants have provided Father Sellinger Program
funding to a wide variety of colleges and universities that
engage in religious and secular expression, defendants have
illegally and unconstitutionally denied plaintiff Father
Sellinger Program funds based solely an the content or viewpoint
of plaintiffs speech, communications, identity, activities, or
affiliation.
 
38.  Plaintiff has unjustifiably and unlawfully been denied
benefits to which it was and is entitled as an eligible
institution as set forth in Maryland Code, Education, Title 17. 
This loss was the result of state action. This state action
violated and continues to violate plaintiff's rights of free
speech and free association under the First and Fourteenth
Amendments to the United States Constitution. The denial of
Father Sellinger Program funds to plaintiff constitutes
impermissible viewpoint and content discrimination. There exists
no compelling state interest to justify the defendants' actions. 
Moreover, even if there is some compelling state interest,
defendants actions are not narrowly tailored to achieve that
interest.

39.  The Commission's guidelines and definitions for allocating
Father Sellinger Program funds to institutions are unlawfully
vague in that persons of common intelligence must necessarily
guess at their meaning and differ as to their application, and
are also overbroad in that they reach constitutionally protected
activity.

40.  By virtue of the unlawful policies and conduct of
defendants, plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer injury
to its rights of free speech, free association and free exercise
of religion, and to the furtherance of its lawful activities.

                 COUNT TWO: VIOLATION OF FREE
                     EXERCISE OE RELIGION

41.  The allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 40
are incorporated herein by this reference.

42. The Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the
United States Constitution prohibits government discrimination in
the allocation of benefits or imposition of burdens based upon an
individual's or group's religious beliefs, character, or
affiliation, or based upon the religious content of their
expression and is applicable to state action under the Fourteenth
Amendment. 

43.  Defendants impermissibly and unlawfully denied plaintiff
Father Sellinger Program funds generally available to other
Maryland colleges and universities. This denial was based upon
plaintiff's religious beliefs, character, affiliation, speech,
and association.

44.  Defendants have not shown and cannot show that denying
plaintiff Father Sellinger Program funds to which it is lawfully
entitled is necessary to serve a compelling state interest, nor
can defendants show that such a denial is a narrowly drawn
means of achieving that interest. 

45.  Defendants' conduct has deprived and continues to deprive
plaintiff of its right to free exercise of religion as guaranteed
under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States
Constitution. 

46.  Defendants' conduct constitutes a failure to give reasonable
accommodation to plaintiff's religious beliefs.

47.  By virtue of the unlawful policies and conduct of the
defendants, plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer injury
to its rights of religious freedom and to the furtherance of its
lawful activities.

                  COUNT THREE: VIOLATION OF EQUAL
                       PROTECTION OF THE LAWS

48.  The allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 47 are
incorporated herein by this reference.

49.  By denying plaintiff the benefits to which other colleges
and universities are entitled, defendants unlawfully and
unconstitutionally have treated and continue to treat plaintiff
differently from other similarly situated colleges and
universities on the basis of the content or viewpoint of its
speech, association, beliefs, character, affiliation, identity,
and activity.

50.  By denying plaintiff the benefits that other colleges and
universities engaging in religious speech and activities receive
and have received, defendants unlawfully and unconstitutionally
treat plaintiff differently from other similarly situated
colleges and universities on the basis of its religious speech,
association, beliefs, character, affiliation, identity, and
activity. 

51.  Defendants' conduct under color of state law violates the
Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United
States Constitution in that it constitutes discrimination on a
suspect basis and violates fundamental constitutional rights. 
This violation is not justified by a compelling state interest
and is not accomplished by narrowly drawn means. Defendants have
singled out plaintiff and denied it Father Sellinger Program
funds based upon the content or viewpoint of its affiliation, its
speech, its expression, and its association.

52.  Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer injury to its
rights of equal protection under the law, and to the furtherance
of its lawful activities, by virtue of the unlawful policies
and conduct of the defendants.

                      COUNT IV: VIOLATION OF
                 RELIGIOUS FREEDOM RESTORATION ACT

53.  The allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 52 are
incorporated herein by this reference.

54.  Defendants impermissibly and unlawfully denied plaintiff
Father Sellinger Program funds generally available to other
Maryland colleges and universities.  This denial was based upon
plaintiff's religious beliefs, character, affiliation, speech,
and association.

55.  Defendants' denial of Father Sellinger Program funds to
plaintiff substantially burdens the free exercise of religion by
plaintiff and its students and faculty.

56.  Defendants have not shown and cannot show that denying
plaintiff Father Sellinger Program funds to which it is lawfully
entitled is necessary to serve a compelling state interest, nor
can defendants show that such a denial is a narrowly drawn means
of achieving that interest. 

57.  By virtue of the unlawful policies and conduct of the
defendants, plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer injury
to its rights of religious freedom and to the furtherance of its
lawful activities, in violation of Religious Freedom Restoration
Act, 42 U.S.C. Sections 2000bb through 2000bb-4.

                     PETITION FOR RELIEF

58.  The allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 57 are
incorporated herein by this reference.

59.  Plaintiff has no plain, speedy and adequate remedy at
law.

60.  Plaintiff is suffering, and will continue to suffer, 
irreparable injury for the period of the continued violation
of its constitutional rights. 

61.  Absent an injunction, defendants will continue to
violate Columbia Union's constitutional and statutory rights.

WHEREFORE, having stated claims against the defendants under the
United States Constitution and federal law, plaintiff petitions
this Court for the following relief:          

A.   a declaratory judgment that the conduct of the defendants in
establishing and applying a policy for the State of Maryland
which refuses to allow the same benefits to plaintiff as to other
similar colleges and universities (benefits including the receipt
of Father Sellinger Program funds) and which denies plaintiff
Father Sellinger Program funds solely and expressly because of
the content or viewpoint of its speech (1) violates plaintiffs
rights to freedom of speech, freedom of association, free
exercise of religion, and to equal protection under the law, as
guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United
States Constitution, and (2) that such actions of defendants are
in violation of 42 U.S.C. Sections 2000bb et seq.;

B.   a permanent order enjoining the defendants from maintaining
and applying a policy of discrimination against plaintiff in the
appropriation of Father Sellinger Program funds or in any other
manner on the basis of plaintiff's speech or on the basis of the
content or viewpoint of the speech or the religion with which
plaintiff is affiliated;

C.  an order awarding plaintiff reasonable costs and attorneys'
fees pursuant to Section 2 of the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees
Award Act of 1976, as amended, 42 U.S.C. Section 1988 (1988); and

D. Such other relief as the court deems just and proper.

For Immediate Release<BR>



                  <CENTER>         <H2>CUC Claims Denial of Free Speech/Exercise of Religion</H2>
                             <H2> In Administration of Tuition Assistance Program</H2><BR></CENTER>


        
<P>        Columbia Union College filed a lawsuit in Federal Court Wednesday claiming that Maryland's
Higher Education Commission unconstitutionally discriminated against the college's religious viewpoint in
its administration of the Father Sellinger Program.  The program, established in 1971, provides state
funding to Maryland's private colleges--both religious and non-religious--to reduce tuition costs.

<P>        Columbia Union, a Seventh-day Adventist college located in Tacoma Park, Maryland, complies
with all state eligibility requirements for Sellinger funding, including a provision requiring recipients to
refrain from using funds for sectarian purposes.  Nevertheless, CUC was denied funding based upon the
commission's claim that the school is "pervasively religious," making it ineligible for funding due to
perceived church-state separation requirements arising from the First Amendment's Establishment
Clause.  Maryland has continued to deny CUC funding since its initial request in 1991, despite funding
other religious schools, including Mount St. Mary's College, Loyola University, and College of Notre
Dame of Maryland.

 <P>       CUC is challenging Maryland's decision, claiming that denial of funds on the basis of religious
viewpoint constitutes a violation of Free Speech and Free Exercise rights guaranteed by the First
Amendment, as well as the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.  This claim is supported by the Supreme
Court's 1995 decision in Rosenberger v. The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, in which
the Court found the University of Virginia's refusal to grant funding to a student publication solely on the
basis of religious viewpoint violated the Free Speech guarantee of the First Amendment.

 <P>       Columbia Union is represented by R. Hewitt Pate of Hunton & Williams, and by the Center for
Individual Rights, a non-profit public interest law firm which represented the successful plaintiffs in
Rosenberger.

  <P>      Michael Rosman, General Counsel for the Center for Individual Rights declared:  "Maryland's
discrimination against Columbia Union violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments, the Religious
Freedom Restoration Act, and simply cannot be reconciled with the Supreme Court's decision in
Rosenberger.  We are pleased to represent CUC in this case."

  <P>      To receive a copy of the complaint, or for more information, please call Robert Alt, Director of
Public Affairs for the Center for Individual Rights, at 202-833-8400, ext. 101.

<H3>THE LAST LINE OF DEFENSE</H3>
</center>
<P>Publication of this extra-length <I>Docket Report</I> was delayed by the Fifth Circuit's momentous 
ruling in <I>Hopwood v. State of Texas</I>, our challenge to racial preferences in student admissions at the 
University of Texas Law School.  We won, and UT lost.  The defendants have asked for an emergency stay, 
arguing <I>inter alia</I> that the cessation of discrimination in student admissions would impose &quot;administrative 
burdens.&quot;  Details on the decision and its near-nuclear fallout on pages 2-5 of this <I>Report</I>.
<P>
<P>In addition to the <I>Hopwood</I> home run, we scored an anti-quota double.  In February, we settled 
a lawsuit against the National Science Foundation and Texas A &amp; M over selected-minorities-only 
summer study programs.  The defendants agreed to pay damages and fees and to desist from further race 
discrimination.  And in March, Ohio State University shelled out $368,000 to end our attack on OSU's 
minorities-only contracting program.  These matters having been settled, we teed up two additional 
race-exclusive programs with federal participation--one in Delaware, the other in Texas.
<P>
<P>In Ithaca, NY, Judge Rumsey of the New York Supreme Court (Tompkins County) heard oral 
arguments on Cornell University's motion to dismiss our lawsuit on behalf of Professor James B. Maas.  
While the motion is still pending, a Cornell faculty committee has concluded that the procedures under 
which Maas was sentenced were egregiously flawed, amply confirming our contention that Jim Maas got shafted.
<P>
<P>Speaking of which, we have agreed to represent two additional victims of the harassment craze.  
Cid Scallet was fired from his teaching job at the University of Virginia's Darden School of 
Management because the powers-that-be hated his politics.  Unable to find a legitimate reason for firing Scallet, 
Darden officials framed him for sexual harassment, the allegation being that Scallet modeled his socks 
provocatively in front of his class.  (No, we're not kidding). 
<P>
<P>More serious charges have been leveled against CIR client Antonio Morrison, a black student 
athlete at Virginia Polytechnic University:  a white female fellow-student has falsely accused Morrison 
of rape and has filed a lawsuit against against him, Virginia Tech, and other defendants.  The plaintiff 
has made a claim under the federal Violence Against Women Act of 1994, which penalizes crimes 
committed against women because of a discriminatory animus.  The &quot;proof&quot; of Morrison's mysogynist bias is 
his alleged failure to wear a condom during an assault he did not commit.
<P>
<P>The country has gone insane, but we're here to save it.  Evidence, as always, in these pages.

 <H2>            Consent Decree in <EM>Henry Painting v. OSU</EM> <BR>Enjoins The State of Ohio<BR>
 From Continuing 100% Racial Set-Aside<BR>
State To Pay Plaintiff $368,000 in Damages And Fees</H2>
  </STRONG><BR><BR>
 <H3> Federal Judge to Monitor State's Compliance for Next 5 Years</H3></CENTER>

   <P>  Henry Painting Co. v. Ohio State University, a widely watched
lawsuit challenging OSU's one-hundred percent minority set-aside, ended
today when the parties signed a binding judicial consent degree.  

<P>     In a stunning victory for the plaintiff, the State of Ohio
agreed to an injunction against "considering race, color, national
origin, gender, social or economic disadvantage, or any factor
other than standard State procurement policies and practices, in
awarding painting contracts at The Ohio State University."  

 <P>    OSU further agreed to pay the plaintiff, Mr. Jerry Henry,
$368,000 in damages and attorneys' fees in exchange for Mr. Henry's
agreement to drop his lawsuit.  Under the terms of the consent
decree, the federal court will retain jurisdiction over the case
for five years.  Should OSU violate the terms of the decree, the
court may impose "all sanctions and remedies authorized by law or
equity." 

 <P>    "I am delighted that we have won." said Mr. Henry.  "My case
has forced the University to end its decade-long practice of
setting aside 100% of painting contacts exclusively on the basis of
race."         

 <P>    Henry, who operates a small, family-run painting company in
Columbus, had filed the case in federal district court for the
Southern District of Ohio on March 30, 1994, after years of racial
discrimination by OSU.

 <P>    Until 1986, Mr. Henry had done hundreds of thousands of
dollars of business each year with OSU.   Beginning in 1986,
however, and continuing through the filing of the lawsuit, the
University refused to allow Mr. Henry to bid on painting contracts
solely because he is white.   

 <P>    OSU engaged in this blatant racial discrimination pursuant to
an Ohio State Minority Business Act, applicable to all state
agencies, which sets aside 15 percent of total state expenditures
each year for selected minority-owned businesses.  Because OSU was
unable to locate any minority bidders in certain lines of work, it
contrived to reach its 15 percent "goal" by reserving all of its
painting contracts exclusively for minorities.  OSU and State
officials rejected Henry's repeated requests to change the policy.

<P>      "The results of this lawsuit will have far-reaching
consequences," said Michael A. Carvin of Shaw, Pittman, Potts and
Trowbridge, who represented Mr. Henry jointly with attorneys at the
Center for Individual Rights.  "The case shows that the State of
Ohio is incapable of defending the constitutionality of its
Minority Business Enterprise Act.  In light of the substantial
damages in this case, it's only a matter of time before the State's
entire system of racial preferences comes tumbling down."

<P>     Michael P. McDonald, President of the Center for Individual
Rights and Carvin's co-counsel on the case, added:  "The Henry
decree is part of the larger trend that we are seeing of successful
lawsuits to end racial discrimination.  I would expect to see state
agencies in Ohio and elsewhere to take a very hard look at their
set-aside practices unless they, too, want to be sued."

<P>     The Center for Individual Rights is a non-profit public
interest law firm based in Washington, D.C.  CIR provides free
legal assistance to deserving clients in cases raising important
legal and constitutional issues.  Last week, CIR won an important
legal victory for its clients in <EM>Hopwood v. State of Texas</EM>, a case
in which the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ended
racial preferences in student admissions to the University of Texas
Law School.

-v-							JUDGE SMITH

THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY, ET AL.,

Defendants.
</PRE>
<CENTER><U>CONSENT DECREE</U></CENTER>
<P>This action was filed by Plaintiffs on March 10, 1994 seeking a
judgment declaring unconstitutional certain provisions of the
Ohio Minority Business Enterprise Act (Ohio Rev. Code SS 122.71,
123.141 and 125.081)("OMBEA").  Plaintiffs allege that Defendants
have unconstitutionally discriminated against them on the basis
of race in the awarding of contracts for painting only to
minority businesses.  These allegations were denied by
Defendants.  The Court's jurisdiction is invoked pursuant to 28
U.S.C. SS 2201 and 2202.   Plaintiffs also seek a permanent
injunction preventing Defendants from applying or enforcing the
OMBEA, and monetary damages under 24 U.S.C. SS 2000d and 2000d-7.
Nothing contained in this Consent Decree, and no actions taken by
Defendants with respect to this Decree, shall be treated         
as an admission of liability by Defendants.

    <P>      The Plaintiffs and Defendants, in good faith, desire to
amicably compromise, settle, and resolve their dispute so as to
avoid the costs and inconvenience of further litigation. 
Accordingly, the parties have consented to the entry of this

assuming such responsibilities.<BR><BR>

III. <U>MONETARY PAYMENT</U>

<P>IT IS ALSO ORDERED, that on or by April 30, 1996, Defendant The
Ohio State University shall deliver a certified check payable to

<h2>FIFTH CIRCUIT PANEL INVALIDATES<BR>
                                  RACE PREFERENCES IN STUDENT ADMISSIONS</h2>

                                                                          March 19, 1996<BR>

</CENTER>
   <P>     In a widely-followed case, a unanimous panel of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals held
that the University of Texas Law School's use of racial preferences in student admissions is
unconstitutional.

  <P>      In its March 18 decision, Hopwood v. State of Texas, the Fifth Circuit declared that
"diversity" is not a "compelling state interest" that would justify the use of racial preferences. 
The Court stated that "[w]ithin the general principles of the Fourteenth Amendment, the use of
race in admissions for diversity in higher education contradicts, rather than furthers, the aims
of equal protection.  Diversity fosters, rather than minimizes, the use of race.  It treats
minorities as a group, rather than as individuals."  The Fifth Circuit held that Justice Powell's
opinion in Board of Regents v. Bakke, in which he advocated the consideration of race to achieve
"diversity," never represented the view of a majority of the Supreme Court.

<P>        The Fifth Circuit held further that the government may employ racial preferences only
as a means of redressing past discrimination by a particular government unit--in this case, UT
Law School.  Racial preferences may not be used to redress alleged discrimination by entire
educational systems. 

 <P>       Theodore B. Olson, the plaintiffs' lead attorney, expressed satisfaction with the ruling. 
"This is a strong opinion that clarifies the law in many important areas," Olson said.  "We
expect that the University of Texas will now comply with the Constitution."  Added his co-
counsel, Michael E. Rosman of the Center for Individual Rights:  "The opinion exposes the folly
of thinking that we can get beyond race by taking race into account.  The decision will be widely
discussed." 

<P>        The Fifth Circuit panel was composed of Judges Jerry E. Smith (who wrote the court's
opinion), Harold DeMoss, and Jacques Wiener. 
  
  <P>      The plaintiffs in the case, white applicants to the 1992 incoming class, were denied
admission on the basis of their race despite their superior qualifications.  Cheryl Hopwood and
Douglas Carvell are represented pro bono by Theodore B. Olson and Douglas Cox of Gibson,
Dunn & Crutcher and by Michael E. Rosman, General Counsel of the Center for Individual
Rights.

<P>        For comments call Theodore B. Olson at (202) 955-8500.  Copies of the opinion and
further information may be obtained from CIR at (202) 833-8400, ext. 103 or 104.    <BR><BR>

</FONT></B>
</CENTER>

<P>

<CENTER>
<B>By Harry V. Jaffa</B>
</CENTER>

<P>

In their convention acceptance speeches, both Bob Dole and Jack Kemp declared that the Republican Party is the party of Lincoln. But just what is the connection between the Republican Party of 1860 and that of 1996?

<p>

The essence of slavery, Lincoln said, was expressed in the proposition &quot;You work; I'll eat.&quot; Upon his election as president, he was besieged by office seekers who drove him to distraction. Lincoln was blunt in his judgment of the great majority of them: They wanted to eat without working. Lincoln saw the demand for the protection of slavery and the demand for government sinecures to be at bottom one and the same. The origin of all constitutional rights, according to Lincoln, was the right that a man had to own himself, and therefore to own the product of his own labor. Government exists to protect that right, and to regulate property only to make it more valuable to its possessors. 

<p>
Today, the pro-slavery impulse still governs the Democratic Party, the party of government sinecures. It is the party that wants to use political power to tax us not for any common good, but to eat while we work. Consider the Great Society and its legacy.

<p>
In the fall of 1964, I was on the speech-writing staff of the Goldwater campaign. In September and October I went on a number of forays to college campuses, where I debated spokesmen for our opponents. My argument always started from here: In 1964 the economy--thanks to the Kennedy tax cuts--was growing at the remarkable annual rate of four percent. But federal revenues were growing at 20 percent: five times as fast. 

<p>
The real issue in the election, I said, was what was to happen to that cornucopia of revenue. Barry Goldwater would use it to reduce the deficit and to further reduce taxes; Lyndon Johnson would use it to start vast new federal programs. At that point I could not say what programs, but I knew that the real purpose of them would be to create a new class of dependents upon the Democratic Party. The ink was hardly dry on the election returns before Johnson invented the war on poverty--and proved my prediction correct.

<p>
One did not need to be cynical to see that the poor were not a reason for the expansion of bureaucracy; the expansion of bureaucracy was a reason for the poor. Every failure to reduce poverty was always represented as another reason to increase expenditures on the poor. The ultimate beneficiary was the Democratic Party. Every federal bureaucrat became in effect a precinct captain, delivering the votes of his constituents. His job was to enlarge the pool of constituents. But every increase in that pool meant a diminution of our property and our freedom.

<p>
The recently passed law to &quot;end welfare as we know it&quot; came about because a lethargic public has been aroused at last, not by the failure of the welfare system but by its success. The public indignation, however, would have been of no effect had we not elected a Republican Congress. No Democratic Congress would ever have passed such a law.

<p>
Just as welfare reform may help end the poverty industry, the California Civil Rights Initiative on the November ballot may lead to the demise of another 1960s product, the racism and sexism industry. The 1964 Civil Rights Act outlawed discrimination based upon race, sex, color, religion or ethnic origin. The act was based on the premise that the only race to which a person must belong is the human race. With respect to God-given natural rights, &quot;all men are created equal.&quot;

<p>
The civil rights establishment, led by the NAACP, fought the good fight that led to the <I>Brown v. Board of Education</I> decision in 1954 and the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1965. They fought that fight under the banner of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment, which reflected the equality proclaimed in the Declaration of Independence.

<p>
The classic statement of this principle is to be found in Justice John Marshall Harlan's dissenting opinion in <I>Plessy v. Ferguson</I>, the infamous 1896 decision that enshrined "separate but equal" into constitutional law for more than half a century: &quot;In view of the Constitution, in the eye of the law, there is in this country no superior dominant ruling class of citizens. There is no caste here. Our Constitution is color blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens. In respect of civil rights, all citizens are equal before the law. The humblest is the peer of the most powerful. The law regards man as man, and takes no account of his surroundings or of his color when his civil rights as guaranteed by the supreme law of the land are involved.&quot;

<p>
Everyone knows that Hubert Humphrey, one of the chief authors and sponsors of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, had declared that under Title VII no discrimination on the basis of race or color was to be lawful. He explicitly said that this meant no discrimination of white against black, and no discrimination of black against white.

<p>
Suddenly, however, remedies for something called &quot;racism&quot; became the order of the day. (The word itself--like &quot;sexism&quot;--is of recent coinage and will not be found in any older dictionaries.) The civil rights movement, premised upon individual rights, suddenly became the black power movement, premised upon group rights. &quot;Affirmative action&quot; became a euphemism for the baldest kind of racial discrimination. That whites had long enjoyed preference over blacks was now taken to be a justification for blacks having preference over whites. What was lost sight of was that the evil of the past--whether of slavery or of Jim Crow--was evil not because it was done by whites to blacks, but because it was done by some human beings to other human beings. The purpose of the law was to end evil acts, not continue them in the guise of &quot;affirmative action.&quot;

<p>
Affirmative action, rightly understood, would justify a wide variety of outreach programs for those whose lives have been stultified by poverty, broken families, bad schools, and neighborhoods filled with drugs, crime and gangs. One can heartily commend a program for tutoring young blacks, or young whites, who had never had a genuine teacher in a real classroom. One cannot, however, commend a program of raising the grades of young blacks--but not young whites--without having raised their skills. And what possible justification can there be there for giving scholarship assistance to the child of a black middle-class family, while denying it to a poor white? Can one imagine a more crass disregard for the genuine meaning of the Equal Protection Clause?

<p>
The priests of this new religion of &quot;affirmative action&quot; are not without material interests. Hundreds of millions of corporate dollars are spent annually on &quot;sensitivity training.&quot; Within the universities, centers for black, brown and women's (i.e., feminist) studies are being established, with vast amount of patronage bestowed upon them. Traditional courses in Plato, Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas, Shakespeare and the Bible continue to appear in the catalogs, but they are increasingly taught by &quot;deconstructionists,&quot; who have no interest in the texts, but only in subjective reactions to the texts.

<p>
Abraham Lincoln was self-educated. His curriculum included Shakespeare, the Bible, Euclid and the Declaration of Independence--the monuments to the freedom of the human soul, the possession not of Western man, but of a humanity compounded of all colors and every condition. In Independence Hall on Feb. 22, 1861, Lincoln asked what it was, above all else, that went forth to the world on July 4, 1776. It was not, he said, the mere matter of the separation of the colonies from the motherland; but something in that Declaration giving hope to the world for all future time. The Declaration gave promise that in due time the weights would be lifted from the shoulders of all men, and that all would have an equal chance. These are the principles upon which the Republican Party must stand, in 1996 no less than in 1860.

</center>

<hr size=4 noshade>

<P>

The Claremont Institute finds the answers to our nation's problems in the principles 
on which America was founded.  It upholds the ideas of liberty and equality.  It 
believes there can be no freedom and justice without a limited and accountable 
government that respects private property, promotes stable family life and maintains 
secure borders and a strong defense.

<P>

The Claremont Institute believes that an informed public can and will make the 
right choices for America's future.  Through its books, policy briefings and articles, 
its lectures, debates and seminars, the Institute engages Americans in an outgoing 
discussion about how they are governed and how their government can be improved.

<P>

Based in California, the Claremont Institute is a major force on the political 
landscape in the nation's largest and most pivotal state.  Its work is also national 
in scope: Institute studies have led to public outrage at the practices of Congress, 
public awareness of an ongoing attack on the American family and to significant 
change in environmental and property rights law.

<P>

The Institute's work is only beginning.  Today, our state and federal governments 
spend vast and increasing sums of public money for less and less good.  The 
public sector grows at the expense of the private.  Regulations intrude into every 
corner of our economic and private lives.  Schools no longer perform.  Police and 
courts no longer protect.  Good businesses are being driven to extinction by 
excessive and discriminatory controls and as a result good jobs continue to 
disappear.  Dependence grows and opportunity wanes with each passing year.

<P>

But America's Founders endowed our Republic with sound principles that bear on 
these problems and a framework for governing that is unmatched in the history of mankind.

<P>

The great conservative victories of 1994 can only be made lasting if they are 
guided by a return to these principles.  The work of the Claremont Institute, 
"the scholarship of the politics of freedom," has as its core these great principles.  
These victories have given the Claremont Institute a unique opportunity to advance 
the application of these principles of the founding to an important audience of 
reform-minded legislators.

<P>

Along with our on-going programs we have launched a series of strategic projects 
that will capitalize on these victories and ensure that the conservative realignment 
is a lasting one:

<P>

In conjunction with William F. Buckley's <i>National Review</i> magazine, the Institute 
publishes <i>National Review West</i>, an insert that goes to 80,000 conservatives in 
the western United States.  <i>NR West</i> features articles by the west's top 
conservatives on issues of state and national import.

<P>

Under the guidance of Distinguished Fellow William Rusher we are 
conducting a series of conferences entitled Project '96.  These 
conferences aim at deepening the debate among American conservatives 
about how to solve the most critical problems facing our country.  
These conferences will address welfare reform, the environment, 
federalism, and the breakdown of the American family.  

<P>

The Claremont Institute believes America's resources are greater than her 
problems.  Its mission is to restore the great principles on which our great 
nation was founded and to recover the institutions that proceed from them.  

<P>

<hr size=4 noshade>

<center>

   <h1>Our Programs</h1>

</center>

<hr size=4 noshade>

<P>

The Claremont Institute is composed of four centers, each with a unique 
mission and a distinct responsibility.

<h4>The Golden State Center for Policy Studies</h4>

Through the Golden State Center in Sacramento, Claremont Institute 
scholars produce publications that educate public policy makers, the 
media, and interested citizens on California policy issues such as the 
budget, education, environmental regulation, workers' compensation, 
health care, and welfare reform.  Golden State Center policy briefings 
have become an important resource for reform-minded state legislators.

<h4>The Salvatori Center for the American Constitution</h4>

The Salvatori Center conducts academic programs that educate high 
school teachers and journalists in the principles of American Democracy.  
The work of the Center is to combat the disastrous trend toward 
multi-culturalism and anti-Americanism and to instill in teachers a deep 
understanding of the American founding.  The Center's publications have 
received national media attention.

<h4>The Asian Studies Center</h4>

The Asian Studies Center holds conferences and publishes books and 
essays on Pacific Rim issues.  Its work has been instrumental in promoting 
a greater understanding of the economic and strategic importance of the 
Far East.  The center has published on a number of issues including trade 
relations, Chinese reunification, defense burden sharing and the future of the 
pro-democracy movement in Communist China. 

<h4>The Center for the Study of the Natural Law</h4>

The Center for the Study of the Natural Law publishes books and essays 
on the state of family life in America.  Its work is directed at national and 
state policy makers to draw attention to the disastrous decline in morality 
that follows from failed social policies.  Recent publications include: On the 
Front Lines of the Culture War: Recent Attacks on the Boy Scouts of America 
and Moral Ideas for America.

   "Where do we look for innovative, free market solutions to the problems

<H3>A MESSAGE TO HOLLYWOOD: <i>Sleaze Doesnt Sell</i></H3></center>
<p>
<ul>
<li>In the absence of strong families, good schools and faithful churches and 
by the power of their own appeal, movies have become an increasingly 
dominant force on our social landscape.
<li>The real and most important power of film is its capacity to alter moral 
sensibilities, and to mold dispositions, outlooks, and habits of the mind 
and heart. The consistent bombardment of gratuitous violence, sexual 
innuendo, profanity, and degradation from popular movies eventually 
shapes, alters, and colors our sensibility.
<li>Despite the significant number of films in the category of <i>Showgirls, 
Striptease, Pulp Fiction</i>, and <i>Natural Born Killers</i> we have seen a 
resurgence in movies that promote traditional moral values such as: <br>
<center>Honor -- <i>Braveheart</i><br>
Courage -- <i>Apollo 13</i><br>
Patriotism -- <i>Independence Day</i><br>
Faithfulness -- <i>Forest Gump</i><br>
Perseverance -- <i>Babe</i><p></center>

<li>In fact, seven of the ten top-grossing movies of 1995 had ratings of G, 
PG, or PG-13 and all of the ten top-grossing movies of all-time had 
ratings of G, PG or PG-13 and are considered family oriented.

<li>These numbers indicate progress can and has been made through moral 
suasion and market forces, not government intervention. Empower 
America intends to keep making the case that civilization needs cultural 
guardrails and certain reliable standards of right and wrong that may not 
be enforceable in law but must be enforceable through conscience and 
consensus.
</ul>
<p>
<i>Empower America</i>, led by Jack Kemp, William Bennett, Lamar 
Alexander, Jeane Kirkpatrick, and Vin Weber is Americas leading grass-
roots conservative advocacy organization.

<P>
<b>U.S. Senator Mr. WALLOP</b>. Mr. President, 18 years ago, and again 12, and again 6 years ago, the people of
Wyoming sent me to Washington to reaffirm their vision of America--to protect the America they
know and love against all enemies foreign and domestic. In each of my campaigns, I made no bones
about who those enemies were, and what we should do about them. Today, as I choose to end my
years in the Senate, I am delighted that our main foreign enemies have collapsed, happy to have
been among the staunchest opponents of communism and the Soviet Union, and thrilled to have
played a major part in leaving our country a splendid new weapon against new enemies who might
arise. But I regret that the domestic enemies against whom I campaigned--big government and the
culture of statism--are a greater threat than ever to the American way of life. The only encouraging
sign on this front is that illusions about the benevolence of government have well-nigh vanished
among ordinary Americans. Perhaps politicians will get the message.
<P>
Far be it from me to claim credit on behalf of conservatives for the fall of communism. I thank God
alone for the fact that the bloody hammer and sickle was hauled down the Kremlin's flagpole on
Christmas Day 1991. And I recognize that the Communist system, corrupt in every way, would still
be aiming missiles at us except for the total, comical incompetence of Mikhail Gorbachev. It is both
presumptuous and futile to speculate what effect, if any, foreigners had on the minds of the Soviet
officials who made decisions that inadvertently destroyed the Soviet Union. Their intramural
discussions at the time contained nothing either about the hardness or the softness of American
policy. Nor for that matter are they about economics. The evidence points to Gorbachev, his friends,
and his antagonists being motivated by the pettiest politics. Moreover, living in the house that Stalin
built, they had lost the will to rule by mass murder, as Stalin had.
But we can be precisely certain of what Americans were trying to do with regard to the Soviet
Union. There can be no doubt about some of us. I told anyone who would listen, every chance I got,
that the Soviet Union and its empire were our mortal enemy, that we ought to do everything in our
power to throw it on the scrap heap of history, and that we ought to prepare to fight, survive, and
win a war against it. President Reagan felt this passion but there is little doubt how ridiculed this point
of view was in high places. Just look up the countless declarations of the Secretaries of State about
how brilliant Gorbachev was, and how dedicated we should be to a United States-Soviet
partnership. Or look up theirs and the prestige press' disdain for the view that communism was
something to be destroyed, not compromised with. These same sophisticates opposed providing the
key weapons to the Afghans who defeated the Soviet invasion of their country. As chairman of the
Budget Subcommittee of the Intelligence Committee, I doubled the budget for our Afghan
operations every time it came before me, and put in provisions for Stinger missiles. I also fought
these same officials to put weapons into the hands of the Nicaraguan Contras who defeated a
Soviet-Cuban takeover of their country that could have put Mexico onto a path far worse than the
excellent one that it is now treading. When these officials, never mind liberal Senators, put their faith
in arms control and in the Soviet Union's observance of treaties, I preferred to trust in American
defensive weapons. The Soviet Foreign Minister acknowledged that the American officials and
Senators felt no inclination to apologize to those whom they had maligned for being right. But that
was not surprising. A press that had joined them in maligning us was not about to insist upon
contrition.
<P>
Most of all I am proud of the role I played between 1978 and 1983 in starting many of the Defense
Department programs that would later be labeled SDI.
<P>
Let me emphasize the difference: The programs I helped to start did not aim at research. Nor did
they aim at abstract, grand schemes: They aimed to produce actual, individual weapons and sensors
to kill missiles that could kill Americans. Then President Reagan put the SDI Program into the hands
of people who, sad to say, wanted to use it for every imaginable purpose--except to build real
weapons. And so, in the name of SDI, hucksters spent billions of dollars for never-never projects,
while arms controllers handicapped real weapons programs diluting, delaying, and usually dooming
them.
<P>
But, I am happy to say, one anti-missile program managed to survive SDI better than might have
been expected. This is the chemical-power space based laser, the very weapon that first raised
interest in serious missile defense 15 years ago. No program was so maligned as this. Everybody
from Edward Teller to Sidney Drell said this laser weapon couldn't be built,
and--paradoxically--said it would be dangerous to try to build it. None was so politically incorrect.
But in a nutshell, by adhering to the guidelines I laid out for it 15 years ago, this program has
produced all the pieces of a weapon that could destroy any missile ever built or designed within 2
seconds, at distances greater than 3,000 miles. If
this country and this Congress want protection against the missiles that Saddam Husseim, Kim
Jong-Il, or anybody else might send against us or our allies, they have only to say so, and this
defensive weapon can be put together. It is there. Now.
<P>
Sure, the arms controllers in the U.S. Government made certain that no program would produce any
component of a weapon. But the good guys can play with definitions as well as the bad guys--and
sometimes the good guys win. The Space-Based Laser Program was broken up into any number of
pieces. But the people running the pieces remembered: Don't build laboratory devices. Build only
things that can be mass-produced. If you must scale down a piece of equipment, do it by using a
fraction of other parts you would use in the real McCoy. Thus the laser you can see at the TRW
facility at San Juan Capistrano, CA develops about 2 megawatts of power. But it has only one-third
of the pieces that an 8-megawatt missile killing device would have. And what is there is laid out in a
frame designed from the outset to accept the remainder of other pieces. So it is with the rest of the
weapon.
<P>
The credit goes to the marvelous American engineers who did it. I hope that the incoming Congress
takes the opportunity to spend some of the money that the American people mistakenly believe is
spent on our mutual protection to buy this device, which could save millions of American lives. If this
happens, I will be glad I had something to do with making it possible.
<P>
But why continue to worry about foreign enemies now that communism is gone? In short, because as
Charles de Gaulle used to say, `The future lasts a long time.' During the past half century we have
been involved in only two major wars, and the parts of the world that are most important to us have
been relatively peaceful because the United States of America has been militarily strong. But in
recent years, under Presidents of both parties, we have been living under the assumption that history
has ended. Nothing could be further from the truth. No assumption could be more dangerous.
American military power--and nothing but American military power--has kept a Pax Americana
over Europe and the Northern Pacific Rim. Now that American power is withdrawing, we see
NATO humiliated on its doorstep, and Japan and South Korea cowering before North Korea's
budding nuclear arsenal. We risk losing the world that our grandfathers won for us in World War II,
and we risk the birth of a world disorder that may require a lot more from our children than the
post-war world has required of us.
<P>
Our country needs better defense policy. Reversing the shrinkage and de-nuclearization of our
Armed Forces, as well as providing a serious anti-missile defense, would be good places to begin.
More important, we need a more serious national discussion of foreign and defense policy. I am
leaving the Senate, but will take part in that discussion.
<P>
The people of Wyoming first sent me to Washington in 1976 in part because I articulated their
frustration with Federal occupational safety and health regulations. Who could be against health and
safety on the job? Who could be against clean air and water? Certainly not the good people of
Wyoming. Certainly not me. Our beef--if you will pardon the expression--is with a government that
uses these and other lofty purposes as a means of exercising arbitrary bureaucratic power.
Government at all levels taxes, spends, and regulates roughly twice as much as when I grew up. It
touches every aspect of our lives, and harms just about everything it touches. It will fine you for not
wearing a seatbelt, but will not protect your life from criminals. It will deliver contraceptives to your
children, but cannot deliver the mail. It prohibits a Jewish community in New York from having a
school district--who knows what politically incorrect things their kids might learn from reading the
bible--and it forces the culture of abortion on the whole country. In the name of racial equality, the
Government forces us to discriminate on the basis of race. Once upon a time, our Government was
a bulwark against domestic enemies. Now big Government has become our chief domestic enemy.
<P>
In 1980 the American people voted for the Republic Party, hoping that the Republicans would
shrink the Government and make it switch sides in the great cultural conflict that is raging among us.
But the Republicans put on their tuxes and spent their time trying to make the system work. And so
taxes rose, regulations multiplied, officials became more arrogant, courts took over more of other
people's powers, and society continued to become less recognizably American. In 1992 the
American people threw out a Republican President who, obviously was on the side of the
Government rather than of the people. Now the electorate has put its hopes in a Republican
Congress, but the American people have made clear that they do not trust Republicans very far.
Almost three out of five Americans say they would like to see a new political party--and most of
those who say so usually vote Republican. To me, this means that the Republican Party has one
more chance to be on the side of the America's people and against their Government. If it muffs this
chance, it will be abandoned--deservedly so. The electorate asked republican politicians to do
something very unnatural to any politician--yield back power. Restore the people's dominion over
turf you have now occupied from democratic plantation managers.
<P>
What should the Republican Party do? Nothing less than to pursue a vision of America radically
opposed to that of contemporary sophisticates--the America our Founding Fathers established, our
fathers fought for, and the America we grew up in. Our Founders--Washington, Jefferson,
Lincoln--set this country on the path to greatness by making sure that our Government would be
small and frugal, that it would be on the side of the virtues necessary to preserve the system. Lincoln,
for example, argued that accepting slavery as an alternative source of labor would undermine respect
for all labor, and that it would foster the habit of living off one another. Lincoln taught that fear of
God, respect for human life, freedom and property, would allow generations of Americans who had
no blood ties to the Founders to become `flesh of the flesh and blood of the blood' with them. The
Government established by the Founders did not make us moral. But it took pains to be on the right
side of the great moral questions.
<P>
This country was peaceful and secure not because the streets were patrolled by Government agents,
but because citizens enforced high standards of civil behavior, because citizens were armed and
protected their own property, and because local police were highly responsive to the demands of
local citizens. The police knew the difference between the decent citizens whom they served, and the
deviants against whom they worked.
<P>
This country was wealthy not because of its natural resources--the Indians had lived in violent
semi-starvation--or because Government gave us this or that, nor because Government forced
wages up nor because it granted privileges to favorite companies. Americans created more wealth
than the world had ever known because Government in America taxed less, regulated less, and gave
fewer privileges than any other government in history.
<P>
This country became a world power not because there are so many of us--the Chinese are six times
as numerous--or because we are so rich--the European Union has a bigger economy--or because
we have so many weapons--Russia has more. Our numbers, our wealth, and our weapons became
military power because the American people are more patriotic, and more apt to think that we have
a duty to do what is right and reasonable than any other people in the world. And we became
powerful because until recently our leaders honored the American people's religion and manliness,
and because they themselves served in the Armed Forces.
<P>
With each passing year, however, our America resembles less and less what the Founders left us
and looks more and more like the countries our immigrant forefathers tried to get away from. This is
happening in large part because the people who are running this country want it to happen and have
used the enormous powers of the U.S. Government to make it happen.
<P>
But Why? It is all too plain that the people who are running this country deeply dislike the America
of the Founders. If the people who run our Government, our universities, our media, the
entertainment industry, the arts, and the so forth had their way, you and I would be placed in
re-education camps--financed by us, of course--to learn new ways.
<P>
What do the elites of this country have against us? They think our patriotism is unsophisticated at
best, and chauvinistic at worst. They thought our opposition to communism was dangerous and
anti-progressive. The current generation of American leaders thought that we were on the wrong
side in the Vietnam war. Two-thirds of our Congressmen have never served in the Armed Fores.
Military service is the rare exception in the families of those who have the most to say about putting
Americans in harm's way. Many in power say that America is nothing special, and that our troops
ought to do the bidding of the United Nations. Moreover, our patriotism exalts qualities that they
abhor: manliness, righteousness, the capacity to use force.
<P>
Often as not American political elites dislike the American people's prosperity. It is the stated policy
of the U.S. Government that the American people consume too much of the world's energy and
natural resources, that our appetite for automobiles, for meat and comfortable houses, is a drag on
the planet and contributes to poverty in the Third World. So, those who run this country want to tax
us to support the United Nations, and they want us to make cars and industry more expensive. They
think that America suffers from public poverty amidst private luxury, so they want to tax more and to
regulate more, to shift power and wealth to people like themselves. Whether the excuse is
environmentalism, or poverty, or crime, the recipe is always the same: Take money away from
independent working Americans and give it to the favorites of the governing class. It transfers only
power--not solutions, only dependency, not liberty.
<P>
Of course, this is a recipe for economic decline. I would remind the Senate that nowhere in the
writings of the Founding Fathers is there anything about managing the economy. Our Founders
wanted to promote prosperity. So they set about ensuring that Government would be small, frugal,
impartial, and moral. We became a wealth country because Government, in Jefferson's words,
would not `take from the mouth of labor the bread it had earned.' If we abandon the Founders'
mores, no economic policy can keep us out of the poorhouse.
<P>
Our leaders dislike our tradition of self-government. They equate local control of crime with brutality and 
racism. Local zoning is racism. Local control of
schools is racist. We are all racists--except they. The have turned laws that prohibit racial
discrimination into mandates for racial preferences in everything from school admissions to
congressional districting, to hiring and firing and promotions, and contracting, and insurance, and
lending. A whole industry has grown up to administer this American form of apartheid. If you want
your town or business to stay out of trouble nowadays, you need highly paid and well-connected
human relations specialists. Within the U.S. Government, in schools and businesses, there are
mandatory counseling sessions--not unlike under communism.
<P>
Of course this sows racial hatred amongst us. It emboldens young blacks to demand menacingly,
and creates new classes of victims among young whites, Hispanics, Asians and politically
unconnected people in general. But in the end, this has nothing to do with race, and everything to do
with leftist politics. The people who run these programs are white men, who are not about to give up
their own privileges to anybody. In the name of racial justice, and at the price of racial harmony, they
are increasing their own power to privilege their friends at the expense of everyone else, and to
diminish competition for themselves.
<P>
The people who run this country don't care about public safety, having made it very difficult for
States and localities to police themselves, having left ordinary citizens with no choice but to protect
themselves as best they can. They are now trying to take our guns away. In fact they blame us and
our guns for crime. This is so wrong that it cannot be an honest mistake. The don't want safety for
us. The want to strike at our culture.
<P>
The people who run this country don't care that our children are being diseducated or that schools
are becoming factories of ignorance and decay. Every proposal regarding education that has come
out of the establishment has called for more money. Over the past 30 years we have tripled the
amount of money that we pay to the public schools per pupil, in real terms. And guess what? Not
only has educational performance dropped everywhere, but it dropped worst where we spent most.
The places where kids are not being hurt too badly, where test scores are highest, are out in the
sticks--in places like Utah, Iowa, and Wyoming, where the establishment has not yet been able fully
to implement its model of big, bureaucratically controlled districts that give out condoms, banish
prayer, teach self-esteem, and bash all American history prior to the 1960's, maybe we hicks aren't
so stupid after all. But the establishment continues to want money, tries to grab more control, and
keeps looking down on us.
<P>
Above all, the people who run this country have deep contempt and enmity for the culture on which
it rests. What must be the moral priorities of those who run the Democratic National Committee,
who declared that the Christian pro-family movement is the most serious threat to America today?
What vision of America must be in their minds that they are frightened by the prospect of more
moms, dads, and children going to church? Clearly their's is a vision very different from George
Washington's and Abe Lincoln's. And are Republican leaders so different? The tell us we are zealots
if we talk about social issues and about the role of religion in public life. I say, what else is worth
talking about? They say: concentrate on the economy. But prosperity comes from the morality and
sense of responsibility of the population, as well as from small government. It comes from the
culture, not from recipes dreamed up in Government offices or think tanks.
<p>
So how do we safeguard, how do we promote the culture that made us prosperous? Do we do it by
celebrating people who terminate their responsibility to the child they have conceived by killing him
or her and at the same time use Medicaid to provide fertility medicines? Do we say, as Stephen
Douglas said about slavery, that we `don't care' one way or the other? I think Lincoln would warn us 
against expecting that any sort
of prosperity, never mind decency, could be built on such views of responsibility and human life.
Again, can education turn out competent workers, never mind decent citizens, if it continues to stress
condoms over continence and relativism over religion? And again, are we going to be healthy
economically--never mind in other ways--if our establishment keeps on talking and spending as if
alternative families and alternative lifestyles were on the same moral plane as mom, dad and the
kids? Not a chance.
<P>
The sum of all this is that our Government is run by people who are using the powers vested in them
by the Constitution, and the powers that come from spending $1.5 trillion per year of our money to
undo what remains of the culture, the habits, the freedoms that made this country unique. There is a
struggle about what kind of country we will be. Government and its allies in the media, education,
and big business are on the wrong side.
<P>
It is all too easy to list the ways in which the U.S. Government is providing incentives to break up
families, to put generations and races at war with one another, to devalue honest work, to
dumb-down and coarsen children, for bureaucrats to seek their own interest, for businesses to court
regulators, to seek protection, and the public be damned. It is also easy enough, as well as satisfying,
to discuss remedies for all these phenomena.
<P>
We can and should end welfare--not `as we know it.' Just end it, period. Charity for those who
deserve it is something with a long and honorable history. But the short history of welfare tells us that
as a Federal program it does no good, only harm.
<P>
We can and should eliminate Social Security. Just as certainly people who are already retired or
about to retire should get every penny already promised. But just imagine if every penny deducted
from us henceforth went into individual retirement accounts. We could all look forward to a lot more
money, and the Government would have a lot less to spend from day to day.
<P>
For the monsters of Medicare and Medicaid we can and should substitute individual medical savings
accounts, backed up by vouchers.
<P>
We can be rid of the ponderous educational establishment by giving parents vouchers for whatever
amount any level of government taxes them to educate their children.
<P>
We can be rid of the most noxious parts of the university world by cutting all direct aid to higher
education and substituting tuition scholarships to individual students which they must repay. Where
this scheme has been tried, students deserted rotten professors in droves.
<P>
We can stop our tax system's pressure against families by increasing deductions for children.
Perhaps those moms who want to will be able to raise their own children again.
<P>
We can be rid of the terrible bureaucracy of the IRS, and of all the distortive inequities of the system
just by instituting a flat tax.
<P>
We can restore self-government by reducing the power of the Federal courts to review the acts of
State courts and the enactments of State legislatures.
<P>
The objective of these and many other provisions would be to shrink Government and to stop it
from doing further harm.
<P>
The good news is that all these things are double. Sure, the American people are sick enough of big
government and have learned to distrust the establishment so much that a reform program of this
kind stands a chance. The bad news is that no set of legislation or even constitutional amendments is
going to sweep away the entrenched interests and bad habits built up over a generation. Our moral
fiber has been damaged. We are no longer quite the virtuous people for whom the Founding Fathers
wrote the Constitution, the people who fought at Gettysburg and at Omaha Beach. That is why to
set us back on the Founders' path we need moral leadership. By this I mean that we must
understand every change we make above all as a means of restoring the character that made
Americans unique.
<P>
We want to cut taxes not primarily because doing so will put more money in our pockets, but
principally because it will put the means of freedom in our hands. We want to cut the Government's
power to grant privilege not primarily because privilege is economically inefficient, but because we
don't want to be a nation of favor-seekers. We want to keep and bear our guns not because we
want to shoot somebody, but because we have an irreducible right to take care of ourselves. Moral 
leadership, today as in 1789, does not mean that the President of the United States forces anyone to go to 
church or synagogue. But it does mean that by word and deed he leads the country in giving unto God the 
things that are God's. Today according to the current Supreme Court, Abraham Lincoln's proclamation of 
Thanksgiving Day would be unconstitutional. I say that Lincoln knew better, and that recent Supreme 
Court decisions on religion are unconstitutional.
<P>
It is impossible to lay out all the instances in which political leaders can exercise moral leadership
precisely because every act of Government influences our habits in some way. Let us not forget that
the Greek philosophers taught that we are the sum of our habits, and that the Greek word for habits
is `Ethics.' If we want to live like Americans, we had better shun the ethics of the people who are
tearing down this country, and strive for the ethics of those who built it.
<P>
Let me conclude by noting that I have not mentioned the name `Clinton,' and that I mentioned both
the Republican and Democratic Parties as part of the problem. America faces a choice between two
radically opposed views of itself and of the good life. On one side is the view you and I grew up
with, the view of the Founders, the way of life of most families in this country. On the other is the
view you can read in the pages of Time magazine, the New York Times, and the Prestige Press.
This is the view that animates the U.S. Government. The great question of our time is whether
Government will continue to work against the original American way of life, or will switch and
support it as it once did. The only possible way of enabling Government to make this switch, I think,
is to cut it down to a small fraction of its current size. Now, this is an issue that transcends parties. It
is an issue that, most likely, will cause a realignment of Parties, or even the death of one or both of
our current parties and the birth of a new one. The more secular we have become the more we pray
to Government for that which we once prayed to God. Nothing happens anymore. Everything is
caused and is therefore to someone's credit or blame. This is nonsense and is unsustainable policy.
Decency yields no more credit than indecency. How can we sustain families on this notion?
<P>
All of that is not so important. The only important thing is that the American people and the
American way of life be defended against their enemies, and that they be defended worthily.
<P>
In all my public life, nothing has cheered and sustained me as much as the constantly recurring
evidence of the good sense and virtue of the American people. And nothing has angered and
dispirited me more than politicians' and other so called elites' disdain for the average American.
<P>
I recall that during the first half of the Vietnam war, the wise men of foreign policy, from McGeorge
Bundy to George Ball, were belittling the American people's demand, echoed by Barry Goldwater,
that we win the war or get out. No, they said. This insistence on victory is simplistic, unsophisticated,
outdated, and lacking in maturity. In our modern age, victory is impossible but involvement is
inevitable. Knowledgeable professionals, namely themselves, were going to adjust the conflict to a
mutually acceptable solution, if only the children of lesser Americans--not their own--would continue
to get themselves shot. Then in the second half of the war, as well as after the war, these same
people told us that our militarism had pushed us in, that we had gotten the lesson we deserved, but
that now we, the American people, had become incapable of supporting a meaningful foreign policy,
namely one led by them.
<P>
This was Henry Kissinger's constant theme in the 1970's. Remember the tones of Spenglerian gloom
with which he justified renouncing the United States' right to protect itself against ballistic missiles?
The weakness of the American people made him do it. By the same token, during the 1980s, from
Strobe Talbott in Time magazine as well as from Harvard and Stanford, we heard how dangerously
stupid the American people were to harken to Ronald Reagan's call to defend this country and to
relegate the Soviet Union to the dustbin of history. The elites knew better--or thought they did. Now
the same people decry as neo-isolationism the elites' call to send the children of average
Americans--surely not their own--to so-called peace-keeping and nation-building missions.
Meanwhile they strip this country's military while their bungling diplomacy stores up future troubles.
And they wonder why the American people think foreign policy is a mess?
<P>
Well, the American people lack neither wisdom nor the capacity for generous sacrifice. The same
year the people of Wyoming sent me to Washington, the country also elected Jimmy Carter. Carter
had campaigned for `A government as good as its people.' He had seemed to reject the
establishment's prescriptions for America's managed decline, most eloquently expressed by Henry
Kissinger. Sadly, he brought in a wing of the establishment that was even further out of sympathy
with America. Almost the same can be said of the
American people's choice of Bill Clinton my point is this: the American people always vote for the
Presidential candidate who seems to embody the old American virtues, the traditional, common
sense view of America in the world. More often than not, alas, politicians have not been worthy of
the people's trust. They have drawn on the well of the American people's generous patriotism, but
have done nothing to refill it. Thank God that well is deep.
<P>
Today it is fashionable among Republican as well as Democratic elites to ascribe the ills of big
government to the American people's supposedly insatiable appetite for government checks and
privileges, combined with their miserly unwillingness to pay for them. According to what one can
hear from practically every talking head in the mainstream media, pork and corruption are
demand-side problems. The politicians and their bureaucratic allies are innocent, just following
orders.
<P>
This is nonsense. The social programs that have done so much harm to this country have been sold
to the American people with false pretenses. Sometimes the very names of the programs are
Orwellian reversals of reality--none more so than `aid to families with dependent children.' Who
would have voted for Social Security if it had been presented as what it is, a chain letter, a ponzi
scheme, that spends the workers money the moment it comes in, and that cannot return it unless
each generation is taxed more heavily than the previous one? Who would have voted for Medicare if
it had been made clear that this would bureaucratize and render much more expensive all health care
in America? And who the heck voted for the Supreme Court decisions that ended America's
tradition of local self-government, and made pornography, abortion, and vagrancy into basic rights
while pushing religion out of public life? Who ever voted to institute a system of racial classification in
this country? Certainly not the American people. All of these things are anathema to the average
American.
<P>
But now comes the crucial questions: How long can any people, no matter how virtuous, remain
uncorrupted when governed by laws and elites that tend to corrupt? This week's New York Times
carries an account of widespread tax evasion in Germany. In Germany? That most order-loving of
countries? Buy why? Simply because it seems that tax burden has grown so great that the people
think it unreasonable. There is no doubt that our own laws and administration, fiscal and otherwise,
have become so burdensome and unreasonable that our own tradition of law-abiding is fading.
<P>
There is no doubt that entitlements and privileges corrupt those who give and those who receive
them, whether they are rich or poor. This list of threats to the American people's virtue is long. No
one can say how long the character and habits bequeathed to us by the Founding Fathers will last
and whether they will vanquish the threats or be overcome by them.
<P>
The size our continent, its fabulous wealth, its indescribable beauty, the ships, tanks, and airplanes in
our arsenal, are no treasure compared to the moral character of the American people. I pray to God
that he will graciously help us preserve and improve it.

<P>
While most sites on the World Wide Web request support of $25, $50 or more, the Frontiers of Freedom Institute would like to spend some quality months building our reputation and earning your respect.

<P><b>Therefore, we are asking for $1.  One dollar.</b>  It may not sound like a great deal of money to you, but frankly, thousands of web users log on to our site every week.  If everyone who viewed our site sent us $1, then we could continue producing quality conservative studies, conferences, and op-eds.  Of course, not everyone will send us $1.  However, we can only hope that this material is of concern enough for many people to simply slip a one dollar bill in an envelope and send it to us.  We will put it to constructive use.  It will allow us to continue moving the ball forward in the debate of conservative and limited government principles versus liberal big government dogma.
<P>
Certainly, if our op-eds and mission statement speak to you in a more passionate and personal way, we encourage you to think about a more substantial gift.
<P><blockquote><I>
For now, however, your support of $1 makes the philosophical connection between our organization and you.  It is a symbolic way of saying -- "Youre doing well.  Continue the fight."</blockquote></I><P>

We thank you for viewing our site and hope we can become more substantive partners in the future in order to advance conservative principles across the country.<P>

<H1><B>FREE's Mission Statement</B></H1>
<P>FREE is a research and educational foundation.  Its purpose is to advance conservation and environmental values consistent with individual freedom and responsibility.  We develop and advocate environmental policies whose goals are realized through private property rights, market incentives, and voluntary organizations.  </P>
<P>Free works with leaders in universities, businesses, environmental groups, government, the media, and think-tanks.  We conduct seminars and conferences, sponsor and write books and articles, and organize special issues of magazines.  </P>
<P>Our most valuable contributions to public policy and the economy come from our incentive-based, free-enterprise alternatives to the policies of the collective environmentalists.  FREE works with a substantial number of academics and writers who hold principled commitments to the ideals of America's Founding Fathers.  These individuals have earned the respect of the policy community for their intellectual integrity and independence.</P>
<P>Essentially, FREE provides an organized forum for developing and debating approaches to ecological issues consistent with the classical liberal values of free enterprise and individual responsibility.  FREE analyses proposals of environmentalists who reject markets and incentives in favor of a bureaucratic, command-and-control approach.  Many professional policy analysts agree that we have earned the intellectual high ground.</P>
<P>Now that all politicians claim to be environmentalists, and the &quot;green&quot; movement is picking up great momentum, their is huge potential for mischief.  Environmental quality can be harmonized with a society of free and responsible individuals.  FREE shows how these goals can go together.  At this time, support for FREE's work is an especially important investment in the public policy arena.</P>  <!--FOOT--><HR>

<H1>Democracies Don't Fight-- Except Over Fish</H1>
<P>By John A. Baden</P>

<P>
The first lesson of international relations is that democracies don't go to war with on another.  In his 1994 State of the Union addresss, President Clinton said that no two democracies have ever warred with each other.  The conventional wisdom is that world peace can be achieved through universal democracy.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, this is not quite true.  There are important exceptions.  And exceptions probe, never prove, rules.  The exception that makes even established democracies take up arms against one another is fish.
</P>
<P>
Consider recent history:  Diplomatic relations between Canada and the U.S., uniquely amicable, are nowhere more antagonistic than over fisheries policy.  Canada has fired upon New Englanders allegedly poaching scallops.   At the end of 1992, twenty Scottish trawlers blockaded one of their own harbors to prevent French supertrawlers from using the port.  A few months later, German and Danish fishermen went on strike and Scottish fishermen spilled oil on Russian catches.  Meanwhile in France riotous fishermen confronted the British Royal Navy, French riot police, and blockaded ports.  Last year, Spain dispatched armed naval vessels to fisheries off Canada's coast as part of an ongoing dispute which included the seizure of Spanish vessels on the high seas by Canadian gunboats.  For decades Brits, Norweigans, and Icelanders have exchanged shots in naval skirmishes as part of their "cod wars".  More recently, violence between Spain and Portugal has escalated from knives and axes to naval gunfire.
</P>
<P>
And it gets worse elsewhere:  A Falklands naval vessel chased Taiwanese fishermen all the way across the Atlantic Ocean. Russia has sent warships to the high seas to "protect" them from foreigners, like the Japanese.  Earlier this year, the "pacific" island nation of Kiribati (population 79,000) arrested and detained a Puyallup man and his vessel at machine-gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
Could the stakes be so high that fish bring violence and conflict to otherwise peaceful relations?  Hardly, if you consider that fishing accounts for less than 1% of the GDP in most of Europe and the U.S.
</P>
<P>
This instability doesn't bode well for the post-Cold War peace.  If we can't manage the diplomacy of fish, how can we manage nukes, human rights, or terrorism?  Moreover, the problems keep mounting. The number of fishermen has doubled since 1970, while their catch has been falling steadily since 1989.  This means more over-capitalized fishermen fighting over the last scraps of dwindling fisheries.
</P>
<P>
Why do democracies fight over fish?  An incomplete legal system provides no clear way to settle conflicts.  Fisheries can fall under national jurisdiction, no jurisdiction, and sometimes both.  As fish and fishermen cross borders, laws change and cheating becomes an artform.  In the European Union, for example, illegal catches amount to half the legitimate total.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, fisheries heritage promotes tension, misbehaving, and conflict.  National politics coddle fishermen, giving them privileges akin to those of farmers.  Protections include cash subsidies, free access to public fisheries, and navies eager to punish foreigners for fishing improprieties.  Worldwide, governments spend an estimated $54 billion in subsidies to harvest just $70 billion in fish.  This means the net value of the world's fisheries is only $16 billion -- Phillip Morris had triple that in sales last year, the cosmetics industry ten times that.
</P>
<P>
With subsidies and open access, too many fishermen chase too few fish.  In that scramble for the last profitable fish, people cross others' lines and capture others' livelihoods.  Then mature democracies roughhouse.
</P>
<P>
Why the fighting?  Marine ecology makes everyone interdependent.  International fisheries are commons, subject to the predictable "tragic" outcomes when coordinated management and limitations are absent.  When countries share fisheries and any nation overfishes, the others suffer.  The international community has struggled to devise institutional arrangements capable of effectively managing their fisheries commons.  Bitter conflicts naturally result.
</P>
<P>
Within nations, special interests distort public policy.  Fishermen in these democracies mobilize support from a sympathetic public and politicians support the industry with a war of escalating subsidies.  The results are nations worse off for wealth transfers, a fishing industry tragically overinvested, and a depleting resource.
</P>
<P>
How could we stop the fighting?  Rules must recognize complexities of fisheries.  When fish cross political borders, ecology trumps sovereignty.  Management must give participants a secure stake in the future of their fishery.  Only then will their decisions integrate the biological and the economic factors into a conservation strategy.
</P>
<P>
Resolution of the problems would come quicker if fishermen knew they must fend for themselves, no subsidies or bailouts.  The key problem is the temptation of politicians to champion the cause of the noble fisherman at the expense of taxpayers, healthy industries, and sustainable fisheries.  This exemplifies the special interest problem so pervasive in democracies worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Exceptions probe the rule.  With fish, we see conflict because the international system of sovereign states is ill-suited to resolve commons problems, and national politicians have incentives to benefit their special interest fisherman.  These factors lead to violent conflict.  We explore these issues further in our forthcoming book from Indiana University Press, <I>Managing the Commons</I>.

<H2>Avoid Political Extinction with A New Shade of Green</H2></FONT>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
The modern environmental movement evolved from the conservation movement of the turn of the century.  We can be grateful for the many notable successes of the early conservationists.  They alerted America to serious problems like "cut and run" timber harvesting, overgrazing government lands, and vanishing game.  However they also gave us a legacy to overcome.  Here's how it evolved.
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
After the deprivations of the Great Depression and World War II, Americans had 25 years of material success.  Environmental sensitivity posed few constraints on the economic boom.  In the economic growth, environmental costs went largely unaccounted for.
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
But as the Americans prospered, gaining in education and affluence, there was an environmental awakening. Rachel Carson's <CITE>Slient Spring</CITE> and the first Earth Day in 1970 opened niches for politicians.  They responded to the nation's growing concern over environmental quality with command-and-control legislation.  Environmental goals implied federal management, political mandates, and stringent regulations. The costs of legislation like the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act were high but so were the benefits.  The Cuyahoga River is no longer flammable and airborne lead dropped 98 percent.
</P><IMG ALIGN="Right" SRC="/free/Images/Bandwagon.gif" WIDTH=250 HEIGHT=270 ALT="Al Gore's Bandwagon">
<P><FONT COLOR="3A3ABD"><B>Environmentalism Today</B></FONT><BR>
<IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>Today, environmentalism is in crisis.  Many early environmentalists came out of the radical movements of the late 1960s.  They were largely innocent of basic economic principles, hostile to business and the market process, and highly optimistic regarding the potential of federal command-and-control regulation.  Some, especially the deep ecologists, advocated a halt to economic progress and a return to simpler, more primal living.  This approach, however romantic, has important economic, ecological, social, and ethical flaws.
</P>

<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
As the bureaucratic pathologies of Progressive-Era agencies like the Forest Service and modern agencies like the EPA multiplied, violations of efficiency and liberty became increasingly obvious.  The "wise use" movement succeeded the Sagebrush Rebellion as rural frustration with federal arrogance mounted.  </P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
Again, politicians responded.  Helen Chenoweth (R-ID), Don Young (R-AK), and others tried scaling back federal environmental oversight.  But the Republican position on the environment is opportunistic and ultimately self-defeating. Republicans promise to improve the education and prosperity of Americans.  What Republicans consistently neglect, however, is that environmental sensitivity increases with wealth and education.  </P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
Don Coursey, dean of the <A HREF="http://www.spc.uchicago.edu/orgs/gspps/">Harris School of Public Policy</A> at the University of Chicago, demonstrates that environmental quality is like BMWs:  as income increases 1 percent, demand for environmental quality increases 2.5 percent.  Simply put:  the affluent and well-educated demand environmental quality
</P>

<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
Newt Gingrich acknowledges this reality by saying, "I don't think any party can be a sustainable majority that ignores or rejects its environmental responsibilities."  So he shouldn't be surprised if Republicans lose the majority.  The word "environment" doesn't appear in the Contract with America.  I just recevied a fund-raising letter from the <A HREF="http://www.rnc.org">Republican National Committee</A> which named dozens of issues but didn't even mention the environment. 
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
Republicans consistently neglect positive environmental reform and cave in to special interests which promote extractive industries and regional subsidies.  Yet well-off, well-educated voters increasingly say, "But Newt, we love the environment!"  Republicans are taking political heat for giving their environmental portfolio to wise-use sympathizers like Young and Chenoweth.  Many Republicans stay home or even defect to the Democrats who support the traditional environmental agenda.  Their own party gives them no comfortable niche.
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
In August, environmentalist and conservationist groups with 20 million members met to voice displeasure with the Republican environmental platform. One participating group, <A HREF="http://www.tu.org/trout/">Trout Unlimited</A>, makes the links between environmentalism, education, and prosperity clear.  The average TU member has an income of $105,000, and 40% of their members have a master's, law, M.D, or Ph.D degree.  Their membership is "conservative on almost every issue apart from the environment," according to TU's communications director Peter Rafle. 
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN="Left" SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
Instead of appealing to this important and growing constituency, Republicans offered ethanol subsidies, salvage logging, and lax efforts to preserve endangered species.  But as Americans become wealthier and wiser they abhor such policies.  Republican Party strategists appear dim-witted or cowardly.  Is exploitation their only alternative to command-and-control, Al Gore statism?
</P><IMG ALIGN="Left" SRC="/free/Images/Briefcase.gif" WIDTH=216 HEIGHT=171>
<P><FONT COLOR="3A3ABD"><B>A New Shade of Green</B></FONT><BR>
<IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>A different shade of green respects ecology, liberty, and prosperity.  Rather than pit the environment against the economy, it harmonizes complementary values.  This evolving environmental vision recognizes the problems inherent to bureaucracies and stresses the importance of local knowledge, incentives, and entrepreneurial innovation.  It rejects government as an engine of plunder while respecting links between property rights and stewardship.  
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
This new shade of green is evolving.  Environmental groups like <A HREF="http://www.tnc.org">The Nature Conservancy</A>, <A HREF="http://www.tu.org/trout/">Trout Unlimited</A>, and <A HREF="http://www.defenders.org">Defenders of Wildlife </A> have had remarkable successes with their voluntary conservation programs.  Firms like <A HREF="http://www.amoco.com">Amoco</A>, Coors, and Port Blakely Tree Farms are creating new value by protecting the environment and improving the bottom line.  And even some government programs are beginning to use market processes to better coordinate management of public lands.
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
If the learning curves of Republicans don't slope upward, that species of elephant may go extinct.  And if Al Gore's statist platform doesn't adapt as well, in the election of 2000, his earth will be way out of balance.  There is a vacant niche for political entrepreneurs who appeal to well-educated, wealthier, greener Americans.  Candidates who can't find it deserve to fail come November.
</P>
<FONT COLOR="3A3ABD"><H2>Clinton's "Green Decrees":  Easy Answers Postpone Reform</H2></FONT>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
Election politics brought a wave of "green decrees" from Washington.  President Clinton has locked in the support of national environmental groups by resolving environmental controversies by executive order.
</P><P><FONT COLOR="3A3ABD"><B>Utah Monument</B></FONT><BR><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
Most recently, Clinton declared 1.7 million acres of southern Utah (seven times larger than Mount Rainier National Park) a national monument, using authority granted under the 1906 Antiquities Act.  With a stroke of a pen, Clinton resolved a bitter, highly polarized debate between environmentalists, who want to see 5.7 million acres declared "wilderness areas" off limits to any development, and locals, who believe the land is so special because they've been stewarding it for 150 years.  There were no Utah officials present at the signing that Senator Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) described as "the mother of all land grabs."  They were not consulted on the matter; the locals and the public were the last to know.  Now Utahns are working fervently to thwart the monument's existence and operation.</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>Snubbing Utahns is a small price for Clinton to pay for the support of the environmental groups; he finished third, behind Ross Perot, in Utah in 1992.  If the monument survives legal challenge, tourism will replace coal jobs.  Locals will guide buses, ATVs, and campers into the monument, rather than drive coal out.</P><IMG ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="/free/Images/Owl.gif" WIDTH=357 HEIGHT=156 ALT="Spotted Owl">
<P><FONT COLOR="3A3ABD"><B>Headwaters Forest</B></FONT><BR> 
<IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>A week earlier, the Administration brokered a halt to the logging in the northern California Headwaters Forest.  Headwaters holds the largest remaining old-growth redwood stand on private property.  As hundreds of protestors and a few celebrities, including pop singer Bonnie Raitt and Don Henley of the Eagles, were arrested, federal officials secretly engineered a tentative agreement with Pacific Lumber to halt the logging in exchange for other government lands and cash payments.  Clinton exploited yet another environmental crisis.  If the tenuous agreement stands, the federal and California governments can expect to spend $350 million to forge a ceasefire in Headwaters.</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="3A3ABD"><B>New World Mine</B></FONT><BR>
<IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>Yellowstone's New World Mine exemplifies Clinton using a green decree to make messy environmental conflicts disappear.  The dispute involved Crown Butte Mines Inc., environmentalists, the Park Service, the Forest Service, locals, and even the United Nations.

<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>In exchange for $65 million in federal lands, Crown Butte forfeits (if the deal goes through) the mineral rights on their land obtained under the Mining Law of 1872.  Voila!  The beast is vanquished.  Clinton can return to Yellowstone, having triumphantly made the dirty mine go away.  
</P>
<P>Until the next gold mine.  Or the next coal mine.  Or the next timber stand.

<P><FONT COLOR="3A3ABD"><B>Green Decrees as Quick Fixes</B></FONT><BR>
<IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>Clinton's green decrees are quick fixes, often at the great expense of other natural treasures and local communities.  For example, as the New World Mine controversy so beautifully illustrates, the Mining Law of 1872 is long overdue for reform.  The myopic 1872 law provides for mineral deposits on federal lands to be turned into commodities like gold and copper, while ignoring other values:  undeveloped wilderness, undisturbed watersheds, and unscarred land.  Although this made sense in the Civil War era, relative values have drastically changed with increased education, scientific knowledge, and affluence.  
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
A truly courageous president would call for fundamental reform.  He would advocate systems that provide incentives to conserve, to account for downstream pollution, and to foster responsible use of the land.  </P>
<P><FONT COLOR="3A3ABD"><B>An Alternative</B></FONT><BR>
<IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>Here's an idea for some political entrepreneur:  Propose a system that replicates for environmental values what the 1872 Law does for minerals.  It would give individuals opportunities to invest in and protect the land for its amenity and ecological features, like wilderness, biodiversity, and recreation.  Public, nonprofit organizations and trusts could stake a "claim" on federal lands, like BLM districts in Utah, and attempt to produce a "mother lode" of environmental quality.  Like mining claims, these would be contingent on "proving up" the environmental qualities of the land.  This way the claimholders would have to be prepared to meet the public challenges of competing users.
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
This sort of change would dramatically alter the nature of the environmental debate in the West.  In addition to reforming outdated legislation, it would move environmentalists from the Beltway to the back country.  No longer would green decrees come from the White House.  Federal authority would serve in its proper role of monitoring and enforcement, not opportunistic rule-setting on an ad hoc basis.
</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="3A3ABD"><B>Politics Brings Gridlock, Conflict</B></FONT><BR>
<IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>Clinton's green decrees are surprisingly effective election politics.  This strategy gets good press because it perpetuates the polarization and gridlocks real reform.  But this short-sightedness is the predictable consequence of political allocation.  Voters may get tired of crisis management of popular areas.  If so, some candidates will advocate genuine reform and be rewarded by voters for honestly analyzing the underlying causes of environmental problems.
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>There is another problem with Clinton's tactics.  Using executive fiat to make others pay for something you want generates perverse consequences and intractable conflicts.  The counterproductivity of green decrees is glaring in Utah's Kane County.  The county is now backing out of an agreement to release endangered California condors into the region.  After the green decree, county attorney Colin Winchester warns, "We're going to be a whole lot less cooperative with the federal government."</P></TABLE>

<H1>Democracies Don't Fight-- Except Over Fish</H1>
<P>By John A. Baden</P>

<P>
The first lesson of international relations is that democracies don't go to war with on another.  In his 1994 State of the Union addresss, President Clinton said that no two democracies have ever warred with each other.  The conventional wisdom is that world peace can be achieved through universal democracy.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, this is not quite true.  There are important exceptions.  And exceptions probe, never prove, rules.  The exception that makes even established democracies take up arms against one another is fish.
</P>
<P>
Consider recent history:  Diplomatic relations between Canada and the U.S., uniquely amicable, are nowhere more antagonistic than over fisheries policy.  Canada has fired upon New Englanders allegedly poaching scallops.   At the end of 1992, twenty Scottish trawlers blockaded one of their own harbors to prevent French supertrawlers from using the port.  A few months later, German and Danish fishermen went on strike and Scottish fishermen spilled oil on Russian catches.  Meanwhile in France riotous fishermen confronted the British Royal Navy, French riot police, and blockaded ports.  Last year, Spain dispatched armed naval vessels to fisheries off Canada's coast as part of an ongoing dispute which included the seizure of Spanish vessels on the high seas by Canadian gunboats.  For decades Brits, Norweigans, and Icelanders have exchanged shots in naval skirmishes as part of their "cod wars".  More recently, violence between Spain and Portugal has escalated from knives and axes to naval gunfire.
</P>
<P>
And it gets worse elsewhere:  A Falklands naval vessel chased Taiwanese fishermen all the way across the Atlantic Ocean. Russia has sent warships to the high seas to "protect" them from foreigners, like the Japanese.  Earlier this year, the "pacific" island nation of Kiribati (population 79,000) arrested and detained a Puyallup man and his vessel at machine-gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
Could the stakes be so high that fish bring violence and conflict to otherwise peaceful relations?  Hardly, if you consider that fishing accounts for less than 1% of the GDP in most of Europe and the U.S.
</P>
<P>
This instability doesn't bode well for the post-Cold War peace.  If we can't manage the diplomacy of fish, how can we manage nukes, human rights, or terrorism?  Moreover, the problems keep mounting. The number of fishermen has doubled since 1970, while their catch has been falling steadily since 1989.  This means more over-capitalized fishermen fighting over the last scraps of dwindling fisheries.
</P>
<P>
Why do democracies fight over fish?  An incomplete legal system provides no clear way to settle conflicts.  Fisheries can fall under national jurisdiction, no jurisdiction, and sometimes both.  As fish and fishermen cross borders, laws change and cheating becomes an artform.  In the European Union, for example, illegal catches amount to half the legitimate total.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, fisheries heritage promotes tension, misbehaving, and conflict.  National politics coddle fishermen, giving them privileges akin to those of farmers.  Protections include cash subsidies, free access to public fisheries, and navies eager to punish foreigners for fishing improprieties.  Worldwide, governments spend an estimated $54 billion in subsidies to harvest just $70 billion in fish.  This means the net value of the world's fisheries is only $16 billion -- Phillip Morris had triple that in sales last year, the cosmetics industry ten times that.
</P>
<P>
With subsidies and open access, too many fishermen chase too few fish.  In that scramble for the last profitable fish, people cross others' lines and capture others' livelihoods.  Then mature democracies roughhouse.
</P>
<P>
Why the fighting?  Marine ecology makes everyone interdependent.  International fisheries are commons, subject to the predictable "tragic" outcomes when coordinated management and limitations are absent.  When countries share fisheries and any nation overfishes, the others suffer.  The international community has struggled to devise institutional arrangements capable of effectively managing their fisheries commons.  Bitter conflicts naturally result.
</P>
<P>
Within nations, special interests distort public policy.  Fishermen in these democracies mobilize support from a sympathetic public and politicians support the industry with a war of escalating subsidies.  The results are nations worse off for wealth transfers, a fishing industry tragically overinvested, and a depleting resource.
</P>
<P>
How could we stop the fighting?  Rules must recognize complexities of fisheries.  When fish cross political borders, ecology trumps sovereignty.  Management must give participants a secure stake in the future of their fishery.  Only then will their decisions integrate the biological and the economic factors into a conservation strategy.
</P>
<P>
Resolution of the problems would come quicker if fishermen knew they must fend for themselves, no subsidies or bailouts.  The key problem is the temptation of politicians to champion the cause of the noble fisherman at the expense of taxpayers, healthy industries, and sustainable fisheries.  This exemplifies the special interest problem so pervasive in democracies worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Exceptions probe the rule.  With fish, we see conflict because the international system of sovereign states is ill-suited to resolve commons problems, and national politicians have incentives to benefit their special interest fisherman.  These factors lead to violent conflict.  We explore these issues further in our forthcoming book from Indiana University Press, <I>Managing the Commons</I>.

<P>
<DD><B>Alexandria, VA</B> -- The television networks substantially increased the number of labels they
applied to Democrats during their 1996 convention over 1992, but at both the Republican and
Democratic conventions this year the networks demanded answers to a barrage of questions from
the left. For Republicans gathered in San Diego, GOP intolerance on abortion was the issue. For
Democrats convened in Chicago, going too far to the right on welfare reform became the media
focus. Adding up both questions and statements made by reporters to one another, abortion or
exclusion of pro-choice voices were raised as an issue 55 times in San Diego, while viewers
heard about welfare reform 43 times in Chicago.
<BR>
<DD>After producing a daily Media Reality Check '96 newsletter during the August political
conventions, the Media Research Center's (MRC) news division staff organized its analysis of
prime time coverage into this special 15-page report. This analysis covers ABC, CBS, CNN
(starting at 8pm ET), NBC and the joint NBC/PBS broadcast. Key findings:
<BR>
<h4>Democrats labeled liberal more often than Republicans tagged conservative.</h4><BR>
 Studies of the 1984,
1988 and 1992 conventions found Republicans labeled much more frequently than Democrats. In
1992, the MRC determined the networks applied 118 conservative labels during the GOP conclave,
but just 38 liberal labels during the Democratic gathering. This year, Republicans were tagged
59 times (13 moderate, 30 conservative, and 16 more extremist terms), but Democrats were labeled
119 times (44 moderate, 71 liberal and four more extremist terms).
<BR>
<DD>In Chicago, Bill Clinton got 28 moderate labels and captured about half as many liberal tags
with 16. In San Diego, the networks focused most of their labeling on conservative delegates and
speakers as Bob Dole went largely untagged -- three moderate and two conservative labels. The
Republican platform was never called moderate and the Democratic platform was never described as
liberal. See page 3 for a summary table and graph, pages 6-14 for examples.
<BR>
<h4>Convention attendees pummeled with questions from the left side of the political
spectrum.</h4><br> On 51 occasions in San Diego Republicans were hit with questions from the left,
especially about intolerance and abortion, but they heard just six inquiries from the right. Two
weeks later instead of questioning Democrats from the right, the networks posed 47 from the
left, the vast majority on how many Democrats opposed President Clinton's decision to sign the
welfare reform bill, but just 11 questions from the right. In this area the networks have grown
more biased. Four years ago, while the GOP got the same treatment, hearing 131 questions from
the left compared to 17 from the right, Democrats got a more even going over with 46 questions
from the left and 38 from the right. See page 4 for a table and graph, pages 7-15 for examples.
<BR>
<h4>Republicans blamed repeatedly for displaying a negative tone, but Democrats go unscathed despite
some pretty vitriolic speeches.</h4>
<BR>In San Diego the networks characterized Republicans with terms
like "negative," "harsh," "strident" or "mean" or described GOP speeches as an "attack," 34
times. Democrats were hit with the negative descriptions just six times during their convention,
but even in Chicago Republicans got hammered more with 23 references to GOP negativity. In 1992,
the networks questioned the Republican tone as too negative 70 times, but never once raised the
subject against Democrats at their convention. See page 5 for a summary table and examples of
the contrast.
<BR>
<h4>Controversies such as Whitewater and Travelgate barely acknowledged.</h4><br> The Clintons are under
active investigation by an independent counsel, but the networks made only seven references to
Democratic scandals. NBC and the joint NBC-PBS broadcast aired two mentions; ABC, CBS, and CNN,
only one. Topics never mentioned: the FBI files scandal, the Iran-Bosnia scandal, and the
special counsel investigations of Cabinet members such as Henry Cisneros and Mike Espy.
Controversies about Republicans, such as questions about Elizabeth Dole's blind trust, were also
ignored.

<BR>
<DD><I>Sam Donaldson, ABC News: </I>
<DD>At both conventions his podium reports provided even-handed observations on what each speaker
hoped to accomplish. In San Diego he refrained from gratuitous attacks on the Republicans for
being too intolerant. In Chicago, on the first day of the convention, Donaldson offered a
balance appraisal of the party delegates, noting that the Democratic delegates "are far to the
left of the mainstream just as the Republicans were to the right of the mainstream." In the
midst of network hoopla over Clinton's acceptance speech, only Donaldson realized that while
Clinton gave a "great speech," the "record shows that the next day he may give a different
speech, change his mind, trim it a little bit, do something else."
<BR>
<DD><I>Lisa Myers, NBC News</I>
<BR>
<DD>One of the few reporters to pose questions from both the left and right. In San Diego, she asked
Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison from the right about how she "has generally opposed efforts to cut
off benefits to illegal immigrants, particularly education and health benefits. Why would
hardworking American taxpayers pay for people who are here illegally?" Then she asked her about
how people who saw her speech "found it too negative. They didn't particularly like the degree
to which you attacked the President. In retrospect, do you think you went too far?" On the first
night in Chicago Myers quizzed a delegate about whether liberals or New Democrats control the
party. Myers was the only broadcast network reporter to provide details in prime time from the
Star story on Dick Morris.
<BR>
<DD><I>Brian Ross, ABC News</I>
<BR>
<DD>Although CNN's Brooks Jackson appeared early in prime time with stories on corporate
contributions and union influence, ABC's Ross must be highlighted despite the fact his pieces
did not air in prime time. In a series of World News Tonight stories, Ross went after, with
equal vigilance, the big money contributors to both parties. Ross raised issues never mentioned
anywhere else on the networks, such as "the giant media corporations," which are "very much in
the middle of the mix." In San Diego he noted that "Last night, the ABC hospitality was a
lobbyist's dream." In Chicago he looked at one big donor, "His name is Arthur Coia, who despite
being President of a labor union the FBI says has long been controlled by the Mafia...has become
one of the Democrats' top money people."

<BR>
<DD><I>Maria Shriver, NBC News</I>
<BR>
<DD>Seemed baffled why a rape victim would have anything to do with Republicans and her interview
with Hillary Clinton following the First Lady's address was more two like old friends sharing
tales of their suffering than a dispassionate interview. Just after rape victim Jan License
addressed Republicans about victim's rights, Shriver asked her: "But why [speak] at a Republican
convention? So many people have said that they don't think this ticket, or perhaps this party,
is supportive of women's issues. Why make this stand here?" Shriver's under the podium interview with the First Lady assumed Mrs. Clinton had been unfairly attacked by Republicans. Shriver
posed questions like "This has been a difficult couple of years for you. Did that applause, the
way you've been treated here, the way people have been reacting to you, kind of make it all go
away?" And, noting GOP criticism of her book, Shriver wondered "How did that affect you when you
heard about that?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Judy Woodruff, CNN</I>
<BR>
<DD>In San Diego she repeatedly demanded that Republicans explain why there weren't more female
delegates, but in Chicago instead of challenging Democrats on their pro-partial birth abortion
stand, she worried about welfare reform going too far and defended Hillary Clinton from
Republican attacks. She peppered Hillary Clinton with six welfare reform questions, all assuming
that it is going too far. By the end she was pleading with Mrs. Clinton to do something:
"Eleanor Roosevelt, whom you admire, mentioned her again just now, said that much of the time
she kept her disagreements with the President to herself in private, but there were times that
she felt it was important to disagree publicly. Does there ever come a time with you, and if not
welfare reform, the what?" 
<BR>
<DD><I>Tom Brokaw, NBC News</I>
<BR>
<DD>Found Republican speakers threaten to be perceived as too mean, took a pot shot at Ronald
Reagan, and portrayed Republicans as insensitive to rape, but praised the speaking power of
Democrats. In San Diego he warned that the GOP knows "it has to lower the threshold of perceived
meanness on the part of the country. In Chicago, after Jesse Jackson's speech which attacked
conservatives, he admired how his words grew "out of a very deep passion." Brokaw did at least
mention Whitewater in Chicago, but after the moving tribute to Ronald Reagan in San Diego he
took this swipe: "Ronald Reagan will have to learn how history will judge his time in office --
the deficits, the Iran-Contra affair." At the GOP conclave he told a rape victim "this is a
party that is dominated by men," so he wondered, "do you think before tonight they ever thought
about what happens in America with rape?"

<DD><FONT  SIZE=+1><B>In 1992, the networks questioned the convention's tone</B></FONT>
as too negative 70 times during the GOP convention, to zero at the Democratic convention. This
year, analysts again searched for questioning of negative tone (such as the use of words like
"attack" or "bash"), and found a similar tilt. In San Diego, prime-time network analysts
suggested Republican negativity on 34 occasions, to one NBC reference to Clinton "pummeling"
Dole in TV ads. In Chicago, the network suggested Republican negativity again on 23 occasions,
to only six occasions for the Democrats. In total, a negativity discrepancy of 57 to 7.

<B>Republican convention:</B>
<BR>
<DD>On August 13, keynote speaker Rep. Susan Molinari said: "Americans know that Bill Clinton's
promises have the lifespan of a Big Mac on Air Force One." Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison remarked
earlier: "America -- it's time to wake up to President Clinton and his high-taxing,
free-spending, promise-breaking, Social Security-taxing, health care socializing, drug-coddling,
power-grabbing, business-busting, lawsuit-loving, UN-following, FBI-abusing, IRS-increasing,
200-dollar-haircutting, gas-taxing, over-regulating, bureaucracy-trusting, class-baiting,
privacy-violating, values-crushing, truth-dodging, Medicare-forsaking, property-rights-taking,
job-destroying friends."
<BR>
<DD><I>Network Reaction: </I>On NBC, Tim Russert warned: "I think the speech by Senator Hutchison of Texas
is dangerous, Tom, because she uses words that could be interpreted by some people as mean." On
CBS, Dan Rather announced Hutchison was "expected to hit President Clinton, rhetorically, with
everything short of a tire tube." CBS's Bob Schieffer called her "Attack Dog Hutchison." CNN's
Judy Woodruff announced: "A Clinton-bashing night." 
<BR>
<B>Democratic convention:</B>
<BR>
<DD>Jesse Jackson said: "President Clinton has been our first line of defense against the Newt
Gingrich Contract, America's right-wing assault on our elderly, our students, and our civil
rights." Mario Cuomo charged: "The Republicans are the real threat. They are the real threat to
our women. They are the real threat to our children. They are the real threat to clean air,
clean water, and the rich landscape of America...in the end, Bill Clinton spells hope and the
Republicans spell disaster."
<BR>
<DD>On August 29, Sen. Ted Kennedy used the same literary device that caused Hutchison to be bashed
for negativity, in this case describing the GOP platform: "It is the radical wish list of the
education-cutting, environmental-trashing, Medicare-slashing, choice-denying,
tolerance-repudiating, gay-bashing, Social Security-threatening, assault-rifle-coddling,
government-closing, tax loophole-granting...minimum wage-opposing Republican majority..."
<BR>
<DD><I>Network Reaction:</I> On Jackson, "The most stirring speech of the convention so far," cooed Dan
Rather. "The old lion has not lost its roar," oozed Tom Brokaw. "Convention rhetoric has not
been much better than it was tonight," exclaimed Ken Bode on CNN. On Cuomo, ABC's Jim Wooten
noted wistfully: "For a quick moment, deja vu...That old-fashioned voice, full-throated, fierce,
raising the rafters worth of Chicago conventions...This was a glimpse of conventions past, when
liberals were still the lions of the party, and rhetoric roared." CNN's Bob Franken asked Andrew Cuomo about his father: "You really are a fan of his speaking style.
It's amazing, isn't it?"
<BR>
<DD>On Kennedy,  Tom Brokaw came out of the speech on NBC/PBS: "Senator Edward M. Kennedy, still in
full voice after all these years in the United States Senate. The proud champion of the liberal
cause, addressing this convention hall once again as he does every four years." On CNN, Ken Bode
observed: "You need a partisan speech, one that puts it to the other party. You get it at any
convention. Ted Kennedy does it as well as anybody could do it. Elder statesman of the party.
Eloquent."

Christians who make up a very large part of this convention. What's the challenge there?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Michel McQueen, 8/12:</I> "Peter, there is no mistaking the passion and the conviction of the
Christian conservative movement to this convention. We told you before that about half of the
delegations are controlled by people who consider themselves to be pro-life and very
conservative...."
<BR>
<DD><I>Michel McQueen to a black delegate, 8/13:</I> "Contrary to the stereotype many people have of
African Americans who are active in politics, Mr. Fobbs is very conservative, he is pro-life, he
is not a life-long Republican, isn't that true?" 
<BR>
<DD><I>Jim Wooten, 8/15:</I> "Bob Dole and Jack Kemp have to identify themselves tonight and they have to
choose whether they're going to be the ticket of the Ralph Reed, religious right, Christian
Coalition Republicans or whether they're going to be the ticket of the more inclusive party
we've seen from the podium this week."
<BR>
<DD><I>Lesley Stahl, 8/12:</I> "You know, TV programmers have an expression: target audience. The target
audience tonight is women, particularly those 30 to 60. The whole purpose of tonight's
convention, the whole program, is to diminish the image of this party as extreme because that's
what's turning the women off. Four years ago, the main speaker at the convention, the Republican
convention, was Pat Buchanan. He was yelling, his pitchforks were raised. Tonight it will be
Colin Powell, he will appeal for civility. On the platform, women find that extreme, it's
turning them off."
<BR>
<DD><I>Dan Rather to U.S. Rep. Susan Molinari, 8/12:</I> "I want to read you a quote, a party official here
said that the role of the prime time speakers, that would include you, is to confuse voters
about the real influence of your party's most conservative wing and the, quote, `Christian
right.' Are you part of that effort?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Dan Rather to Pat Robertson, 8/13:</I> "True or untrue: that if elected, a President Dole would be
more to the right than candidate Dole."
<BR>
<DD><I>Ed Bradley to two Missouri delegates, 8/13:</I> "We had talked earlier about the fact that polls
show that most of the delegates of this convention are more conservative than Republicans at
large. How do you get that message out to people who are not, perhaps, not as conservative as
you? How do you convince them to support the Republican ticket, the Republican platform?" Lesley
Stahl, 8/14: "We're hearing a lot of grousing about the re-packaging of the party. We've spoken
to delegates in Louisiana, Missouri, other delegations, who are saying, Where are our issues? In
gagging opponents of abortion, affirmative action, those kinds of issues, Bob Dole may be
turning off the very people he needs to leave the convention gung ho. They say putting three,
pro-choice women on last night was too much. But Bob Dole has a dilemma: In order to win, he
does have to change the perception of this party as too extreme. Dan."

this convention. How does this sit with you?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Bob Franken to Gerald Ford, 8/12:</I>  "President Ford do you worry  the Republican Party in the last
couple of years became a more conservative, or at least was pictured as a more conservative
sometimes a party that seemed to be going away from the politics that you stood for?"
<BR>
<DD><I>William Schneider, 8/12:</I> "President Ford mentioned what he called a drift to the right in the
Republican party. He was always known as a moderate Republican from the center of the party. And
he says it's been reversed by this convention. Well, I'm sure he believes that, a lot of people
do. But they wrote a platform that is very much a right wing platform. It was written by a lot
of social conservatives."
<BR>
<DD><I>Gene Randall to an Idaho delegate, 8/13:</I> "Do you feel that the line-up of speakers at this
convention reflects a platform which seems to be much more conservative than the speakers?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Gene Randall to Phyllis Schlafly, 8/13:</I> "With me is Phyllis Schafly, an ardent anti-abortion
rights advocate. Do you think the speakers do not reflect the conservatism of the platform?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Bernard Shaw, 8/13:</I> "Bob Dole did not get the tolerance language he wanted in the abortion plank
which came out of this platform committee earlier in the week. He didn't get a few other things.
The conservatives have iron clad control over this convention."
<BR>
<DD><I>Bob Franken, 8/14:</I> "It's interesting they just had a moment ago a very brief tribute to the
Republican freshmen in the House of Representatives. Why brief? Because they are highly, highly
controversial. It's the freshman of the House of Representatives that really gave Bill Clinton
the extremist issue, fairly or unfairly."
<BR>
<DD><I>David Bloom, 8/12:</I> "There is a sense of pride among these Republicans that he [Colin Powell]
will articulate why he is a Republican. Frankly, there is some trepidation on part of some of
the more conservative delegates. They do not see eye-to-eye with him on their views."
<BR>
<DD><I>Tim Russert, 8/13:</I> "Key word: mean-spirited and extremist. They want to avoid those labels. They
have thus far after two days and that's why you're not going to see Newt Gingrich in prime time
tonight. I think the speech by Senator Hutchison of Texas is dangerous, Tom, because she uses
words that could be interpreted by some people as mean."
<BR>
<DD><I>Tim Russert after Dole's speech, 8/15:</I> "These are difficult speeches to give as you know, Tom.
He's appealing to a very conservative audience in the hall here but he's trying to reach

Congress, which fairly or unfairly the voters seem to see as extreme, you've heard all the
words. Do you think that's true and does it make you feel repudiated at all?"

conservative from Senator Lott, but tonight on the NewsHour, Pat Buchanan said most of his views
were consistent, most of Senator Dole's views, were consistent with his own, and he cited
specifically, affirmative action, and the platform position on illegal immigration. And as you
all know, Pat Buchanan is on the farthest extreme of the right wing of the party. How does that

large percentage of the actual delegates on the floor, not people who spoke from the podium,
were members of the quote `religious right.' A very large percentage of these delegates
represent organized labor, but we're not seeing that many union/labor people speak from the
podium itself." Dan Rather to Jesse Jackson, 8/26: "Bill Clinton's been running pretty hard to
the right, so far that some Democrats now call him a `Republicrat.' Do you go that far?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Dan Rather to AFL-CIO leader John Sweeney, 8/29:</I> "Who do you think Bill Clinton is: liberal,
moderate?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Dan Rather to Senator Ted Kennedy, 8/29:</I> "A liberal has been defined as a person too
broad-minded to take his own side in an argument. That's never been a problem for our guest in
the booth now, Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts. Thanks for being here. They say Bill
Clinton is the ultimate pragmatist; That he fakes left, runs right, but has really no immovable
core principles of his own. Has that been your experience?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Rather:</I> "You know that Senator Dole, Jack Kemp, House Speaker Gingrich say, to the public, Bill
Clinton's posing as a centrist but as soon as he gets elected he's going to be right in there
with Ted Kennedy and they'll be working the same old liberal agenda. True?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Sam Donaldson, 8/26:</I> "Well first of all they want to accomplish the same thing the Republicans
accomplished -- showing a unified party, even though we know from our survey that these
delegates are far to the left of the mainstream just as the Republican delegates were to the
right of the mainstream...."
<BR>
<DD><I>Jeff Greenfield, 8/26:</I> "What's interesting to me, Peter, is the delegates who clearly are way to
the left even of rank and file Democrats, much less the country, have signed on to a moderate
centrist platform." 
<BR>
<DD><I>Cokie Roberts 8/26:</I> "What the delegates there [Texas, Oklahoma, Virginia delegations] and the
politicians there have been telling me tonight is this convention has got to look very moderate
for their Democrats to win in those states..."
<BR>
<DD><I>Sam Donaldson, 8/26:</I>  " Cuomo and Jackson were supportive of the President, but they preached the
liberal line."
<BR>
<DD><I>Peter Jennings, 8/27:</I> "Well, whether this is orchestrated or not, it's almost as if Democrats
here who share many of Mrs. Clinton's liberal views are saying to the Republicans we like you as
they liked Mrs. Dole."
<BR>
<DD><I>Jeff Greenfield, 8/27:</I> "That's right, which is why I have come to think of her speech as
liberalism lite. This was a speech in the first place aimed at Democrats who do believe in a
much more communal concept of family..."
<BR>
<DD><I>William Schneider, 8/27:</I> "Well I think the word Kennedy or Kennedyism to Democrats means tough
liberals. It's a combination that's become very rare these days."
<BR>
<DD><I>William Schneider on Mario Cuomo's speech, 8/27:	</I> "And he had a unique twist on Clinton's move to
the center. Very controversial among liberal Democrats when he said, the President actually
lifted the albatross from the party so that we could better sell our core Democratic
principles."
<BR>
<DD><I>William Schneider, 8/27:</I> "You know if this night, this day of the convention, the afternoon,
evening, remembered for anything I think it's two things really. One is Jesse Jackson and Mario
Cuomo early in the evening who were making the liberal case for the reelection for Bill
Clinton."
<BR>
<DD><I>David Broder after Cuomo and Jesse Jackson, 8/27:</I> "Well, they've [Democrats] let the country in
on a big secret, there are still liberals in the Democratic party. In fact this convention hall,
delegates, are filled with liberals. And the Congressional Democratic party is still a liberal
party. But most of the message so far has been, `We've changed, we're new, we're different.'
What you heard tonight was a very old fashioned partisan Democratic message."
<BR>
<DD><I>Judy Woodruff to Senator Bob Kerrey, 8/28:	</I> "The Republicans are now saying, `Just wait. If you
think Bill Clinton's been liberal up until now. Just wait. When he's reelected he's gonna feel
free to move to the left and do all those liberal things that he's really wanted to do all
along.' And you're aware of this debate that's going on about whether it's gonna be Bill Clinton
to the center or Bill Clinton to the left. What do you think?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Tom Brokaw to Vice President Al Gore, 8/26:</I> "Let me ask you about the state of the Democratic
Party and President Clinton's fortunes particularly. It seems to me that he's doing a lot better
now because the win by the Republicans in 1994 really forced your administration to move much
more swiftly to the center. Is that proposition wrong?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Brokaw, 8/26:</I> "The Vice President was saying no no no, this is not forced on us by the
Republicans, we really always had this kind of thing in mind in the first place. But since 1994
they have slid across the political spectrum to really right of center. And they've got a guy by
the name of Dick Morris who's advising them on a daily basis how to be more pragmatic."
<BR>
<DD><I>David Bloom, 8/27:</I> "Tom, I'm down here with Joe Kennedy, son of Robert Kennedy, a liberal
legacy. When many Americans look to that podium tonight, they'll say that's a liberal First
Lady. What does she need to say, what ought she say tonight?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Tom Brokaw to James Carville, 8/29:</I> "Lot of buzz out there about Dick Morris having to leave the
campaign. He was the man who moved him to the right. I know that you had some philosophical
differences with Dick Morris. Does this mean that the door has been opened again for those of
you who believe that the President probably ought to move a little more left of center?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Tom Brokaw, 8/29:</I> "Clinton will have something tonight for the more liberal Democrats who are
here and not happy that he signed the welfare reform bill, which they believe is too radical.
He's going to talk about a proposed program to encourage job creation for welfare recipients and
businesses, especially in the inner city."

<BR>
<DD><I>Mark Shields, 8/26:</I> "Bill Clinton has another great advantage that Bob Dole didn't have. Bob
Dole had to deal with the most activist wing of his party, which in this case are the cultural
conservatives. He had to appease them, he had to mollify them, he had to best them at some
times. Bill Clinton, because of the fact as we've discussed in the past, is unchallenged and has
been unchallenged for renomination within his own party, that the party has accepted him as the
standard bearer, for the last 12 months has been able to run for the middle, so there is no
faction of the party that he has to spend any time, effort, or energy this week really
mollifying."

[Hillary] may not change the numbers for her husband, that she either helps or hurts in the
intensity of the feeling. That for instance, liberals like the delegates here feel more
enthusiastic about the President because they know she's really a committed liberal?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Tom Brokaw, 8/27:</I> "There will be other speakers tonight as well, some stars from conventions
past; the Reverend Jesse Jackson, Mario Cuomo, two of the, of course, large liberal voices in
this party of diminishing liberal voices, so we have a full night ahead here, Jim."
<BR>
<DD><I>Lisa Myers to Senator John Breaux (D-LA), 8/28:</I> "I'm here with one of the smoothest operators in
the United States Senate. A man who worked very hard to pull President Clinton to the center,
Senator John Breaux of Louisiana. Senator, you said today, that you thought the President went
left in the first two years, not because he is a liberal at heart, but because he wanted the
liberals to like him. Explain what you mean."
<BR>
<DD><I>Gwen Ifill, 8/28:</I> "Barney Frank certainly is an outspoken liberal, one of the last few standing.
And I'm interested in finding out whether pragmatism has replaced true liberalism at this
convention?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Margaret Warner to Clinton/Gore Deputy Manager Ann Lewis, 8/29:</I> "Alright, let's talk briefly
about campaign strategy. As we've heard a million times tonight, Dick Morris was the strategist
that helped Bill Clinton figure out how to move back to the center and so on and it was
controversial as Dee Dee Myers just said, even inside the White House. Do you think that that
course will be maintained, Ann Lewis, with Dick Morris gone?"

<BR>
<DD><B>From the left:</B>
<BR>
<DD><I>Ed Bradley to Tom Hayden, 8/26:</I> "Senator Hayden, there are people who say the Democratic party
has become very pragmatic in an effort to win this election, they've given up their principles.
Your response to that?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Rita Braver to Geraldine Ferraro, 8/27:</I> "That's right, Dan, and there have been times that you
could actually feel the floor shaking with all the cheering here [in response to Hillary
Clinton's speech]. Mrs. Ferraro, why was there such a huge reception for the first lady? Is it
because she's been such an object of attack?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Ed Bradley to U.S. Rep. John Lewis, 8/27:</I> "Do you think it's going to be difficult [to mobilize
Democrats] given the positions he's taken, particularly on welfare, to get some people out?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Rita Braver to a Minnesota delegate, 8/28:</I> "Now that you've had some time to be here at the
convention, have your reservations gone away? How'd this speech cut through to you? You've been
worried about welfare."
<BR>
<DD><I>Ed Bradley to U.S. Rep. Ron Dellums, 8/29:</I> "Congressman Dellums was unhappy when the President
signed the welfare bill. I know you saw it not as welfare reform but more as a budget cut. What
does he have to do to fix it?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Bradley to Dellums:</I> "When the President is expected to say tonight that he's going to propose a
$3.5 billion jobs program for welfare recipients, is that enough?" 
<BR>
<DD><B>From the left:</B>
<BR>
<DD><I>Wolf Blitzer to Hillary Clinton, 8/27:</I> "What goes through your mind when you hear some of these
bitter attacks against you?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Bernard Shaw to Senator Bob Kerrey, 8/25:</I> "How can you do that when the leader of your party has
vetoed a welfare bill that many people in this hall feel he should have signed? I mean signed
which he should have vetoed. But politically he had no recourse."
<BR>
<DD><I>Wolf Blitzer to Mario Cuomo, 8/27:</I> "But on this issue of welfare reform which maybe, even if
Bill Clinton is reelected over eight years the most significant decision he makes. He signs this
welfare reform legislation into law. Could have this enormous, from your perspective, negative
impact on a million children could go into poverty. How do you rationalize that kind of decision
and now come forward and give this rousing endorsement for Bill Clinton to be reelected?"
<BR>
<DD><B>From the right: </B>
<BR>
<DD><I>Candy Crowley to a delegate, 8/28:</I> "Do you think that the teacher's unions have done enough to
change schools?  What I'm wondering is, the point from the Republicans is that the schools, most
everyone agreed, need help. Why not get some parent involvement in there through school
vouchers? Let people pick schools. Are you against that idea?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Wolf Blitzer to AFL-CIO chief John Sweeney, 8/28:</I> "Many of your members are Republicans. How do
you explain to them that you're using, in effect, their dues to help elect Democrats?"
<BR>
<DD><B>From the left:</B>
<BR>
<DD><I>Tom Brokaw to former Texas Governor Ann Richards, 8/27:</I> "You paid the price to some degree. You
lost the governership of Texas because this country still is a little bit schizoid, isn't it,
about the role of women in American politics?" 
<BR>
<DD><I>Maria Shriver to Hillary Clinton after her speech, 8/27:</I> "You are credited with really
redefining the role of First Lady and for doing that you've taken a lot of heat, a lot of
criticism. As you look back, do you wish you'd redefined it a little less?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Shriver:</I> "You talked a lot tonight about It Takes A Village, your book. And as you well know,
that was a lightning rod for criticism at the Republican convention. Kay Bailey Hutchison took
off on it, Bob Dole took off on it. How did that affect you when you heard about that?"
<BR>
<DD><B>From the Right:</B>
<BR>
<DD><I>David Bloom to James Carville about Hillary Clinton's speech, 8/27:</I> "I was struck by the fact
that she talked about health care and the need for more health care insurance for the
unemployed. That's a topic that got her and Bill Clinton into a lot of trouble two years ago.
Why would she revisit that tonight?"
<BR>
<DD><B>From the left:</B>
<BR>
<DD><I>Elizabeth Farnsworth to White House Deputy Chief of Staff Harold Ickes, 8/26:</I> "We're looking
tonight at this whole question of who the Democrats are. Did the President turn his back on
fundamental Democratic principles when he signed the welfare bill?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Farnsworth to Ickes:</I> "Does it worry you that the welfare, signing the welfare bill is unraveling
the safety net that took so long to put together?" Tom Brokaw to HHS Secretary Donna Shalala,
8/26: "If you were a poor single mother in a poor rural state in America, without many
resources, and you wanted to go to work, you want to do all the right things, but there aren't
many jobs for people who have real skills, wouldn't you be slightly terrified looking into the
next two years?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Maria Shriver to Georgia Governor Zell Miller, 8/27:</I> "We were just hearing Tim Russert talk
about the platform. A lot of the delegates here don't feel that the platform reflects the
Democratic Party that they joined five, ten years ago. Why are they wrong?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Shriver:</I> "But how concerned are you about the divisions, that people would say tension, this
isn't reflective, the Democratic Party sold out, it's a, it's a Republican Party with a
different name?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Shriver:</I> "But when you get out and you walk this floor of this convention center, do people come
up to you and say, `I am really angry about welfare reform, this is not what the Democratic
Party is about.'"
<BR>
<DD><B>From the right:</B>
<BR>
<DD><I>Lisa Myers to Senator John Breaux, 8/28:</I> "Doesn't that [Clinton moving to center] reinforce
claims of the President's critics who say that he is a man without many deep convictions, who in
fact is guided by the need to be liked, and by a burning desire to get re-elected?"

<TITLE>About the Media Research Center</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<blockquote>
<CENTER><h2>Media Research
Center History</h2>
</CENTER>
<P>
<dd>Founded by <a href="/mrc/about/bozelbio.html">L. Brent Bozell III</a> in 1987 with a mission
to bring political balance to the nation's news and entertainment
media, the Media Research Center has become the nation's largest
and most respected conservative media watchdog organization.<BR>

<P>
<dd>With the most sophisticated computerized tape archive
(over 115,000 hours of footage) and database of its kind in the
world, the MRC tracks and analyzes virtually everything in the
national media. Every day teams of MRC analysts input into a custom
designed computerized database everything the leftist press is
saying. And then confront liberals in the press directly with
evidence of their slanted reporting.<BR>

<P>
<dd>The <A HREF="/mrc/news/"><B>News Division</B></A> publishes two newsletters,
<I><B><A HREF="/mrc/mediawatch/">MediaWatch</A></B></I> and <I><B><A HREF="/mrc/nq/">Notable Quotables</A></B></I>,
which document the leftist bias in the news media every month.
At a national press conference on June 5th in Washington, D.C.,
the MRC formally launched <B><A HREF="/mrc/reality/">&quot;Media Reality Check '96&quot;</A></B>a $2.78
million campaign that represents the most ambitious, comprehensive,
and technologically advanced effort ever undertaken to neutralize
the left-wing news media. And the MRC's new book <I><B><A HREF="/mrc/bookstore/">Pattern of
Deception: The Media's Role in the Clinton Presidency</A></B></I>
is a result of four years of research and analysis.<BR>

<P>
<dd>The <B><A HREF="/mrc/entertainment/">Entertainment Division</A></B> exposes the left-wing
agenda in the entertainment media.  In 1995, it opened
an office -- the <B><A HREF="/mrc/ptc/">Parents Television Council</A></B> (PTC) -- right
in the heart of Hollywood. Its two missions are to bring family
programming back to television and to identify, recruit, and mobilize
the emerging conservative movement in Hollywood. In early February,
the MRC held a bipartisan press conference featuring Senator Joseph
Lieberman (D-CT) and Representative Lamar Smith (R-TX). Seventy-four
lawmakers also signed a letter calling for a return to the <B><A HREF="/mrc/entertainment/famstuff.html">Family
Hour</A></B> which would enable parents and their children to
share in quality programming.<BR>

<P>
<dd><B><A HREF="/mrc/freemarket/">The Free Market Project (FMP)</A></B>
is another division of the MRC and works to educate the media
on what they know so little about -- the free market system. FMP
publishes a monthly newsletter, <I><B><A HREF="/mrc/medianomics/">MediaNomics</A></B></I>, as well as other books, monographs, and <A HREF="/mrc/news/sreport.html"><B> Special Reports </B></A>.
FMP also hosts <B>Quarterly Breakfast Forums</B> which bring together
conservative public policy makers and the media. The goal is to
teach the media to report more accurately conservative positions
on key economic and business issues.<BR>

<P>
<dd>MRC spokesmen challenge reporters with evidence of
liberal bias regularly on television programs like NBC's <I>Today</I>; CNN's <I>Crossfire</I> and <I>Reliable Sources</I>;
CNBC; and NET programs.  MRC research is used by every major national
(and local) conservative talk show host, like Rush Limbaugh, G.
Gordon Liddy, Ollie North, Paul Harvey, Mark Rosen, and dozens
of others.  The MRC produces a nationally-syndicated newspaper column
and articles for the top newspapers in America, including
<I>The Wall Street Journal</I>, the <I>Washington Post</I>, the
<I>Washington Times</I>, the <I>New York Post</I>, the <I>L.A.
Times</I> and many others.<BR>

<P>
<dd>In 1992, the MRC founded the <a href="/mrc/about/internad.html">
<B>Montgomery Internship
Program</B></a>, with the purpose of helping young conservatives in
their pursuit to bring balance to journalism.<BR>

<TITLE>The Real Clinton</TITLE>
<CENTER><img src="/nationalreview/images/real2.gif" ALT="The Real Clinton"></center>
<P>
<hr width=50%>
<P>
<!---------------------------------------------------------------->
The Real Clinton is more or less the opposite of the Real McCoy. What you see is very definitely not what you get, and indeed it may not be what you see a moment or two later. There is a chameleon quality about the 42nd President of the United States, a quicksilver opportunism, that enables him to don and doff identities like cloaks: the New Democrat who promises to end welfare as we know it, the paleo-liberal who takes on the Klan in defense of black churches, the economic statesman who steers by the bond market, the policy wonk avid to socialize one-seventh of the U.S. economy, the moralist who crusades against illegitimacy, the redneck roue with Astroturf in the back of his pick-up, the nostalgia-merchant who wants teenagers home by seven, the futurist with visions of an information superhighway, and at all times and on all occasions the bringer of empathy who feels the pain of that day's audience, whether millionaires or the poor, feminists or Good Ol' Boys, labor unions or blue-chip managements.
<P>
Underneath all the empathy, however, there is a set of policies and attitudes that gives a sort of consistency to his Administration, and even to his personality. In the following pages, we examine this Real Clinton from several angles. We look at Clintonism, that ambidexterity of campaigning right and governing left; at Clinton's steering of the economy by the stars of focus group and polling data; at the multicultural refashioning of the American identity in which he nervously colludes; at his stumblings down the multilateral by-ways of foreign policy, talking loudly and carrying a small stick; at his high-minded healing and sly exploitation of America's most entrenched problem -- race; at the manifold ways in which he, Hillary, and their confederates hidden in the last agencies of the alphabet, have abused federal power to extend their own personal power; and, finally, at that most extraordinary amphibian, Clinton the Bully Pulpiteer. Tales, in short, to / <I>``harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood</I> / <I>make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres</I> / <I>thy knotted and combined locks to part / and each particular hair to stand an end</I> / <I>like quills upon the fretful porpentine.''</I> Now read on.

Congress overseeing the courts!This might be the most frightening thought I've ever had. The Constitution provides for Judicial Review whereby the Supreme Court determines the constitutionality of law. The courts were established to de-politicize the law. We are now considering turning this on its head? Would Dick Gephardt find that <I>Roe</I> v. <I>Wade</I> was a clear instance of the Court making law rather than interpreting it? Would Newt Gingrich find that 209 is unconstitutional (a point with which I disagree)? No . . . they are partisan. Congress was given the power to confirm or reject any nominee. Perhaps if they took that responsibility more seriously, most questions of the court's integrity would simply disappear.<br>

Yes, Congress should make laws that regulate the courts, but not in a way that compromises the separation of powers, and certainly not based on politics or public opinion. Rather, the law should mandate that the Bench include a significant number of non-attorneys. There is utterly no reason that lawyers should run all three branches of government, in addition to business, politics and especially legal education.<br>

Yes, congress should have the power to override a court decision. The Supreme Court is the most powerful branch in our government. Congress should exercise their rights using the elastic clause. Congress should be able to overturn ludicrous decisions that undermine the values of America. Decisions in cases such as Roe vs. Wade and those taking the Ten Commandments and prayer out of schools should be reviewed by Congress and if found necessary "veto" the Court's decision.<br>

Given the philosophy of your motley crew, I suggest you skip this step to curb the power of our courts, which have apparently functioned fairly well for over two hundred years, and just do away with them altogether.

Yes, Congress should make an attempt to control the courts. But long before that, journalism should do the job, by exposing these closet tyrants and all their works and pomps. Some way should be found to make public the records of each judge, and the light of public opinion should be made to shine on each of them.<br>

Victoria Carter, you got it right-on; there is no hope within the judicial labyrinth. However, your straight jacket idea just might be obtainable. Remember, this whole problem revolves around money. Remove the bucks, and you mitigate the problem. How about this? (1) Eliminate payroll-deduction of taxes; let the earners manage their own money. (2) Establish a uniform flat tax system, Dick Armey feels 17% will do. (3) Each month the wage earner would subtract one twelfth of his personal exemption from what he has made that month, then send a check for 17% of it. (4) Start teaching basic economics in the first grade. When the taxpayer sees his hard earned money being used as pork-barrel spending buy votes for politicians, it won't take long for both the courts and the government to change.<br>

When a student can finish law school without even reading the Constitution, we will be hard pressed to find judges who cherish and uphold the fundamental principles that have made America great. Should Congress put a reign on Congress? You are putting the cart ahead of the horse. First we must elect a Congress with the guts to stand up for what is just and right instead of what is politically correct or socially popular. We must do away with all the special group rights and return to the concept that the most important and inalienable rights are those of the individual, no matter what his color, creed, or religion.<br>

Yes. The Courts are taking unto themselves powers which are not theirs under the Constitution. Moreover, they are claiming the exclusive power to determine whether or not their actions are proper and constitutional. The answer is a constitutional amendment, which it is unlikely that the congress will find the will and the gumption to institute. An equally grave issue is that, with the proliferation of case law and the extension of the courts into every area of our once private lives, the practitioners of the law, the attorneys, no longer can predict with any confidence what will be the consequences of any given motion or action. We now have the legal system as glorified slot machine, in which one puts in one's money and pulls the lever. Finally, even the randomly dispensed justice which our system affords, is beyond the economic reach of the average party. Thus we have a legal system available only to the wealthy, to which class we must strive to attain in self-defense, to the protected classes, for whom the government checkbook is opened, and to those attorneys, who are allowed to pull the lever of the slot machine without putting in their nickel.<br>

I think it is clear that the judicial system has long ago ceased to serve free America. The judicial system of the United States exists today to benefit one group and one group only, and that is attorneys. We would be far better served by a non-antagonistic, interrogatory form of judiciary modeled perhaps on that of Germany. We have made the existing jury system a sacred cow, and as with most sacred cows, we're not sure precisely why we're not killing them instead of feeding them, but we're sure that our forefathers who told us to do so must have known. It is time to re-examine this system in the cold light of logic and reason, not sentiment. Changes must be made. As for as the interpretative function of the courts, it does serve as an ingenious form of checks and balances that probably should not be tampered with. An extremely pragmatic understanding of human nature and group dynamics led our forefathers to include this as a safeguard against "mobocracy." Their other safeguard, the appointing of senators as opposed to the election of same, has already been obviated. A nation full of people who will pay $7200 for a Tickle-Me Elmo doll that will be $32 on the shelves shortly is not rational enough to live without a strong Supreme Court.<br>

I find it terribly amusing that a liberal like Leslie would feel that "an activist judiciary is crucial to a functioning democracy"no, little girl, an activist judiciary is only crucial to a government that does things the way YOU want them to without having to bother with other people's opinions, feelings, OR rights. Conservatives may cry out for the Judiciary to enforce the 2nd amendment, but only because it is ripe hypocrisy to have an activist court that ONLY legislates from the bench in favor of liberal causes. No, Leslie, let's face it, you don't want democracy, you want a dictatorso long as she does it your way, and so
you can distort every opinion which doesn't agree with yours as oppressive and evil (which is what liberals always do when they don't want to have to think too hard about their own opinions).<br>

Federal courts interfering with a state's internal matters is unconstitutional. Any ruling, such as in California's Prop. 209 is illegal and a smack in the face to all Americans in every state. Judicial activism is illegaldespite the threat of federal force. Americans have the moral and constitutional right to use whatever force necessary to repel and abolish the tyranny of judicial activism. But I sure hope Congress does something about it first.<br>

I think the courts have co-opted WAY too much power for themselves and are not answerable to the people. They legislate from the bench and that is a CLEAR violation of the constitution. The checks provided against them from the constitution are clear and so are their powers. THE COURTS HAVE SUPERSEDED THEM!! It is time for their power to be reigned in. Liberals allowed the powers of the court to expand to further the liberal agenda. Even though conservatism is taking over, we must not allow ourselves to fall into the judicial trap. We must go forward on legislative acts and ignore, as much as we can, the judicial corruption that has pervaded the judiciary (thanks to the liberals). Legislation IS the power of the people, not the judiciary, as the liberals believe. The judiciary has been used by the liberals to BYPASS the will of the people! Now everyone knows, the reason for the judiciary is to protect the people from the tyranny of the masses, but the people are much better educated today then 200 years ago. Also we have 200 years of experience behind us. WE KNOW WHAT WE ARE DOING!!!! End judiciary enslavement now!!!!!<br>

This is rather a moot question. The question might well have been "Should the People Put a Rein on Congress"? Congress is responsible for the making of laws consistent with and/or within the restrictions of the US Constitution. States rights are "not to be" impugned unless matters exceeding the rights of the State are in question. Lawmakers invariably test these premises and submit to the electorate a concoction of "favorable or popular" jurisprudence. This, with the knowledge that it will end in court. Changing a few judges will not change the situation. If true tests are applied through appeals and our learned judicial deems a contest of interpretation with the Constitution is in order; then and only then should the Supreme judicial powers come into arbitration. This tends to make the opposition to any Supreme decision decry political infatuation. I've lived through the depression and several wars, good times, hard times are always going to be around. We have a healthy political system and a very precise Constitution that needs no tinkering with. The best for all to do is fill our legislative and congressional domains with the most fervent of learned folks. We will continue to have detestable laws, politicians, and decisionsand on the other hand, many acceptable laws, politicians, and decisions. We are a nation of laws. This is life and a pretty darn good one at that.<br>

What would happen if the Supreme Court ruled on a 5-4 majority that law-abiding adults under 21 were ineligible to vote in federal elections? What would we do if Clinton and Gore were removed from office for obstruction of justice in the V. Foster affair, and tax fraud (with regard to Buddhist Temple donations to the DNC) respectfully, and the AFL-CIO brought suit to block Speaker Gingrich from becoming President, and the Supreme Court sided with the union? What would we do? The only true check on government power, of any kind, is a well-educated, mature, populace. It also helps if that populace is well armed. Watch for Amendment II, like Amendment X, to be declared unconstitutional.<br>

Permit the Supreme Court to invalidate or otherwise declare unconstitutional a state law ONLY by a UNANIMOUS decision of the court. This act would seriously check the Court's trampling of states' Rights. If unanimous jury verdicts are required for criminal trials, then protecting the will of the people, as expressed by their duly elected legislatures, deserves no less rigorous a procedure.<br>

As conservatives, we support the "original intent" interpretation of the Supreme Court. That is that this judicial body is, by definition, to review cases to determine constitutionality of rulings and decisions. This deliberating body was to be made up of the great judicial minds of the time. Can anyone detect where we might have some deviation yet?<br>

Congress and the Courts shouldn't be linked. They are to a certain extent, but this should be maintained as little as possible. The bigger question is whether the courts have a right to interfere with what has been passed down in an election. Example: the affirmative-action case in California. Does a federal judge have a right to block this action??? I always thought that the courts were there to see that laws were enforced . . . Could you help me??<br>

Randy and others, It should be clear to you since the election that leaving pure politics in the hands of the electorate is a lost cause. Instant gratification is the rule of the land in their minds. Americans in general have their wants, their needs, and their rights muddled together. They think that if they want something bad enough it becomes a need. And if they can't get it, it becomes their right to have it. It seems the judiciary feeds on this and therefore the legislature is so busy trying to "fix" what the courts decree that they are unable to make reasonable law.<br>

This is an easy one. The courts are NOT allowed to hear cases involving the internal affairs of any state. Article III, Section 2, not to mention Amendment X of the US Constitution, spell out the scope of Judicial power. The courts may not hear cases involving the laws of a particular state, unless it is appealed as to an issue arising under the US Constitution. Most of the cases heard by the Court do not fall under its legal scope, and are therefore null and void. California Prop 187, 209, <I>Roe</I> v <I>Wade</I>, etc. are internal state affairs and out of the reach of the federal courts. Judges and Justices who do not respect their very limited scope should be removed for behavior inconsistent with their service. The US Constitution is a very precise and clear document; there are no "vapors," "emanations", or "penumbras" incorporated into its substance. Justices who have a difficult time with this concept should be promptly retired.<br>

What Congress should do is actively review the decisions of courts such as the decision which occurred in California to block the popular implementation of Prop. 209 to end affirmative action. Congressional committees should be formed to look into controversial exercise of judicial power and decide if the federal judges making such decisions by their records merit impeachment. The indefinite terms of federal judges were meant to shield them from the influence of short-term political pressures, but liberal judges have regarded them as means to thwart the implementation of conservative legislation. Congress should simply exercise their powers to protect the rights of citizens in the practice of democracy.<br>

The Congress should put a rein on the courts, but it won't. As long as the Supreme Court keeps giving liberals the decisions they want, Democrats will block any efforts to restore power to the legislatures. Almost all the checks and balances on the courts require either two-thirds of Congress, or 60% of the Senate and presidential signature, neither of which Republicans are likely to have anytime soon. Senate Republicans could block Clinton's liberal appointments, but they are too gutless. Court reform is just not going to happen.<br>

If you think that control over the judicial system should be given to Congress, now that Congress is in conservative hands, remember what happened to Robert Bork when he sought confirmation. Remember what almost happened to Clarence Thomas. However, judges and the activist legislation they create must be brought under control, since they are now essentially unaccountable. There have been no checks on judges' activist liberalism, which is why we're in the trouble we're in today; the people themselves never voted for most of the liberal legislation that is destroying this country. However, the power to make judges accountable must not lie with Congress, since Congress itself was unaccountable for 40 years of nonstop liberal Democrat rule. There should be a safeguard within the system itself, a safeguard that is regulated by the Constitution. The only real safeguard would be a Constitutional amendment that Congress cannot touch, an amendment limiting the power of judges. This could take the form of term limits, recall, or legislation that requires strict construction of the Constitution in any judicial interpretation. Newt Gingrich often states that the Founding Fathers designed a system so inefficient that no dictator could force it to work. But unfortunately, it wasn't so inefficient that Congressional barons, imperial presidents, and judicial petty tyrants couldn't find loopholes. All of these branches, rather than acting as checks and balances on each other, have conspired to create dictatorial agencies that go unregulated, and legislation that is beyond the reach of the public. The key to getting this leviathan state under control is not to give any one branch special jurisdiction over anothersuch as Congressional control over the judiciarybut to put the entire system in a strait jacket. We must tie the entire system in so many knots that it will have to become responsive to the people that it is supposed to serve. This might take the form of limiting executive privilege and autonomy, enacting term limits on Congress, giving Congress control over Federal agencies, enacting a balanced budget amendment, and so on. The government should have unlimited authority to control itself while leaving us free. However, this may well be impossible, since the ability to tie the system in knots implies the existence of a degree of control that we no longer have, if we ever really had it at all. Ultimately, the ability to control the system lies with the peopleand if the people remain ignorant, shallow, emotion-driven, dull-witted, and foolish in their condition of childlike dependence. We will all continue to live under the dictatorial control of the monster that we have created.<br>

Sir Winston Churchill stated, more than fifty years ago, "The women's suffrage movement is only the small edge of the wedge, if we allow women to vote it will mean the loss of social structure and the rise of every liberal cause under the sun." Now, some fifty years later, only Judge Robert Bork has had the courage to state, "Radical feminism is the most destructive and fanatical movement to come down to us from the Sixties. . . . Totalitarian in spirit, it is antagonistic to traditional Western culture and proposes the complete restructuring of society, morality, and human nature." And one of the major forces of that Radical Feminism, Catherine A. MacKinnon, has asserted that "feminism could supplant both Marxism and liberalism as a theory of politics." Should Congress put a rein on the courts? Indeed. But what is most needed is an emboldened male and female leadership that will have the courage of a Churchill and a Bork to tell the American public what it already knows, but quakes to acknowledgeEnd Feminism, restore America. The much derided, potatoe spelling champ Dan Quayle had a splendid moment when he challenged Murphy Brown, and that earned him years of scornful ridicule.

Constitutionally, the courts only exist to interpret the law. The purpose of the federal courts and Supreme Court of the United States is only to decide the constitutionality of laws passed by the legislative body. In far too many instances, we find the court "creating law" by its ruling in issues. Precedents are set, and are interpreted as law by the populace. Technically, if a law is found to be unconstitutional, then it is up to the legislature to formulate a law that is constitutional regarding the issue at hand. Our nation has gone too long in permitting courts to "write law" by their rulings. Congress should place reins on the courts by re-writing laws that the court rules to be unconstitutional, especially when this is true on technical bases only. In addition, constitutionally, the Executive Branch of our government should only be the enforcer of laws passed by the legislature. It is Congress that represents the peoplenot the Courts, nor the President.<br>

The primary purpose of the federal judiciary is to protect our individual freedoms, and the rights of the people and the states, against encroachment by an oppressive central government. Sadly, the judges don't seem to do a very good job of it, but this is not the fault of our constitutionally mandated tripartite system; it is because the executive branch appoints lemons. If something needs to be reformed, it is the bloated and unresponsive executive branch of the Federal Government. We could begin by electing ethical presidents.<br>

Of course Congress should put a rein on the courts. Thomas "I love a good revolution" Jefferson put it well: "To consider judges as the ultimate arbiters of all constitutional questions [is] a very dangerous doctrine indeed, and one which would place us under the despotism of an oligarchy. Our judges are as honest as other men and not more so. They have, with others, the same passions for party, for power, and the privilege of their corps[a]nd their power is all the more dangerous as they are in office for life and not responsible . . .  to the elective control."<br>

The Courts absolutely must be given the message that they exist to carry out the laws of the land, in addition to throwing out those that violate the Constitutional rights of the people. The Courts DO NOT have the right to legislate through their judicial process. The role of Congress must be, collectively, individually, and through its Judiciary Committees, to ensure that all candidates for appointment are well grounded in the historical, Christian religious basis for their role. The basic foundations of right and wrong derive from our Founding Fathers' actions and words during the writing and adoption of the Declaration of Independence, and the Constitution. Members of Congress must recognize this, affirm it, and demonstrate it during their formal proceedings such as in the Senate's advise and consent function, or be candidates for ousting at the next election. American citizens must recognize their moral responsibility in this process, and not be duped by the liberal establishment including the teachers' unions, if the decaying process of this Republic is to be stopped!! The new Congress must be bold, and LEADERS must step forward with personal conviction!<br>

The reason we don't like the Brady Bill is that it does absolutely zero to prevent crime, and is nothing more than something to make liberals feel good. To correct you, voters, liberal, conservative or whatever, may vote any way they choose. Judges are mandated by the Constitution not to have individual agendas; voters vote as such; liberal judges do not. And then, Leslie, you pull the expected liberal ruse: switch the subject to homosexuals, lesbians, minorities and women's bodies. It sure takes the mental work out of the discussion, doesn't it? Maybe <I>NR</I> will have the courage to make a Soapbox of your obsessions for us to comment on.<br>

The American public is the only hope for reining in the federal court Frankenstein monster! Congress is basically useless in this day and age. The American people will, eventually, simply tell the courts to "go to hell" in the same manner as they did the "Dred-Scott" courts back in the 1800s. If the people do this via Congress, it will require a massive overthrow of both the Democrats and Republicans who have created the judicial beast through apathy and politics. We are currently being ruled by a 54 black-robed oligarchy that ignores traditional U.S. (not-multicultural) traditions and institutions. If not altered, the country is going to collapse in the not-so-distant future.<br>

The existence of an independent court, whether this was or was not intended by the Founding Fathers, is certainly a desirable check against the tyranny of the majority. The majority is not always right; Rousseau, not a favorite with conservatives (with good reason), nevertheless held correctly that the majority is right only when it is right! However, the federal court system has become an oligarchy run by liberals with the support of liberal law schools and bar associations. It is time not for the abolition of the autonomy of the court system but for its modification. We should give the Congress a greater role. Perhaps a 3/4 vote of both houses of Congress should override a court decision about the unconstitutionality of legislation in certain carefully controlled circumstances. Robert Bork, in his book <I>Slouching Towards Gomorrah</I>, has some good ideas about this.<br>

The liberal courts' usurpation of citizens' freedoms is just another example of the slave-master mentality of the left. Clinton's claim of acting out of compassion does not make acceptable his rape of our rights. The Clinton courts have done more violence to our basic civil rights, as expressed in the Bill of Rights, than all of America's enemies throughout history.<br>

It is time that somebody or some entity do something about the courts. I am certain that when the Constitution was written, no one had any thought of the courts being stacked with socialist activists far more intent on furthering their own agenda than clearly interpreting the Constitution. In the recent California case concerning the CCRI, a U.S. District Judge, Thelton Henderson, literally extorted the case from the legally chosen judge, using as the reason an absolute and easily substituted lie. Judge Henderson and many other left-wing court appointees have track records of pure socialist-activist decisions where the Constitution is completely ignored. One begins to wonder if these decisions fall under the mandate of the Constitution which states, "The judges, both of supreme and inferior courts, shall hold their offices during good behavior." It would seem that completely ignoring the Constitution, in favor of your own political beliefs, would qualify as bad behavior. If Congress is the place, where are they when these blatant violations are routinely dismissed as normal procedure?<br>

In the cases of 209, 187, welfare reform, yes, somehow we have to limit idiot judges in the Ninth District. Boy am I glad I moved from Taxifornia to South Dakota two years ago where unusual things are the Corn Palace and jackalopes at Wall Drug. I think I remember some folks leaving England for points west a while back over similar issues.<br>

The people can control the courts by controlling for whom they vote. When conservative thought controls legislative bodies, those nominated for appointed offices and judgeships tend to be of the same mindset. The liberals do the same. Wise and thinking citizens not only vote, but cast their ballots for right-thinking people of unquestioned morals, both professionally and personally. This is for any election, from President to dogcatcher.<br>

Yes Congress should rein in the Courts, although I am not sure how that would be accomplished. The Courts have too many times overturned the will of the people, and the will of the people reins supreme!<br>

The men who wrote the Constitution carefully designed a Federal Government with three separate and distinct parts, each part to act as a check against the other two. This implies an equal division of power among the three parts.<br>

Oh sure, reign in the courts now that they've passed a few decisions conservatives don't like. Last week, though, you were all just dying for an interventionist court to overturn the Brady Bill. Judges are committed to leaving their prejudices outside the courtroom, but nothing stops voters from carrying their bigotry into the voting booth. So Californians choose a strident repeal of the state's guarantee of civil rights, and Congress/puritanical legislatures forbid states from acknowledging the loving union of same-sex couples. The duty of the courts is to let democracy work, but keep it in check by screening out centuries-old hatreds (or sexist worldviews, such as those that deny women the right to control their own bodies). As such, an activist judiciary is crucial to a functioning democracyunless, of course, you think women and minorities don't count.<br>

Recent events suggest that the power is out of balance, having shifted toward the Judicial. This works to the advantage of the Executive which has the power of appointment. The legislative is weakened and with it the voice of the electorate. Two initiatives passed by the voters of California have been, in effect, nullified by federal judges. A majority of California's voters, its Governor and its legislature have been over ruled by one person who seemingly has the power of a dictator. At the very least the Congress should require that a federal judge explain in concrete rather than abstract 'read between the lines' detail exactly why he believes the law he over turned is unconstitutional. Lacking a rational reason, the judge should be overruled This last case is a real farce. The judge evidently believes that outlawing discrimination is unconstitutional! Great care must be taken to stop this type of nonsense without altering the system set up by the Founders. Restoration, not alteration, is what's needed here. I believe that we should not let Congress put a reign on the courts. The reason is simple . . . balance of power. Congress has a chance during a justice's appointment to approve a justice. Our Republican Congress should really scrutinize Clinton's appointments. Not just let them in without a hitch. Now it's too late to do anything. Maybe we should let the Citizens of the US put a reign on the courts? What do you think???<br>

<hr width=50%>
This important, bipartisan legislation has been sponsored in the 104th Congress<br>
by Senator John Breaux and Representative Jim McCrery.  Briefly, this Act establishes accounts available to all taxpayers that would permit:<br> 
</center>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Unlimited tax deductions for all contributions.
<br>
<li>No penalty taxes nor forced distributions at any age.  Taxes are paid solely upon withdrawals.
<br>
<li>No income tax nor estate tax at death.  Beneficiary has benefactor's tax basis. (See Note A)
<br>
<li>Home Purchase/Sale Tax Deferred Rollovers (See Note B)
<br>
<li>Tax-deductible purchase of life insurance, provided the proceeds are added to the tax-deferred account.<br>
</ul>
<p>
Note A: With all withdrawals being taxed at ordinary income tax rates,
there is no rational need for income tax nor estate tax at death.
 The beneficiary can maintain the account and assumes the benefactor's
tax basis, if any.
<br><p>
Note B: Principal Residence Rollovers:<br>
<P>
Home Purchase:  up to $15,000-indexed for inflation-of otherwise
taxable distributions may be rolled over from the account without
tax for first purchase of principal residence.  However, the tax
basis of residence is reduced by like amount.
<br>
<P>
Home Sale:  proceeds from sale of a principal residence may be rolled over
into the investment account without tax.  The tax basis of the account is
thereupon adjusted to reflect the tax basis of former residence, plus the
existing law's $125,000 exemption on the home's sale after age 55.<br>

 To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a deduction for 
 contributions to individual investment accounts, and for other 
 purposes. 
   Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
 United States of America in Congress assembled, 
 SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
   This Act may be cited as the `Individual Investment Account Act  
 of 1993'. 
 SEC. 2. ESTABLISHMENT OF INDIVIDUAL INVESTMENT ACCOUNTS. 
   (a) In General: Part VII of subchapter B of chapter 1 of the 
 Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to additional itemized 
 deductions for individuals) is amended by redesignating section 220 
 as section 221 and by inserting after section 219 the following new 
 section: 
 `SEC. 220. INDIVIDUAL INVESTMENT ACCOUNTS. 
   `(a) Deduction Allowed: In the case of an individual, there shall 
 be allowed as a deduction an amount equal to the aggregate amount 
 paid in cash for the taxable year by such individual to an 
 individual investment account established for the benefit of such 
 individual. 
   `(b) Definitions and Special Rules: For purposes of this section-- 
       `(1) Individual investment account: The term `individual 
     investment account' means a trust created or organized in the 
     United States for the exclusive benefit of an individual, but 
     only if the written governing instrument creating the trust 
     meets the following requirements: 
           `(A) No contribution will be accepted unless it is in cash. 
           `(B) The trustee is a bank (as defined in section 408(n)) 
         or another person who demonstrates to the satisfaction of 
         the Secretary that the manner in which that person will 
         administer the trust will be consistent with the 
         requirements of this section. 
           `(C) No part of the trust assets will be invested in any 
         collectable (as defined in section 408(m)). 
           `(D) The assets of the trust will not be commingled with 
         other property except in a common trust fund or common 
         investment fund. 
       `(2) Time when contributions deemed made: A taxpayer shall be 
     deemed to have made a contribution on the last day of a taxable 
     year if the contribution is made on account of such taxable  
     year and is made not later than the time prescribed by law for 
     filing the return for such taxable year (not including 
     extensions thereof). 
   `(c) Tax Treatment of Distributions:  
       `(1) In general: Except as otherwise provided in this 
     subsection, any amount distributed out of an individual 
     investment account shall be included in gross income by the 
     distributee unless such amount is part of a qualified 1st-time 
     homebuyer distribution. 
       `(2) Qualified 1st-time homebuyer distribution: For purposes 
     of this subsection-- 
           `(A) In general: The term `qualified 1st-time homebuyer 
         distribution' means any payment or distribution received by 
         a 1st-time homebuyer from an individual investment account 
         to the extent such payment or distribution is used by the 
         individual within 60 days to pay qualified acquisition  
         costs with respect to a principal residence for such 
         individual. 
           `(B) Dollar limitation: The aggregate amount which may be 
         treated as qualified 1st-time homebuyer distributions for 
         all taxable years shall not exceed $15,000. 
           `(C) Basis reduction: The basis of any principal  
         residence described in subparagraph (A) shall be reduced by 
         the amount of any qualified 1st-time homebuyer distribution. 
           `(D) Definitions: For purposes of this paragraph-- 
               `(i) Qualified acquisition costs: The term `qualified 
             acquisition costs' means the costs of acquiring, 
             constructing, or reconstructing a residence. Such term 
             includes any usual or reasonable settlement, financing, 
             or other closing costs. 
               `(ii) 1st-time homebuyer: The term `1st-time 
             homebuyer' means any individual if such individual had 
             no present ownership interest in a principal residence 
             during the 3-year period ending on the date of 
             acquisition of the principal residence to which this 
             paragraph applies. 
               `(iii) Principal residence: The term `principal 
             residence' has the same meaning as when used in section 
             1034. 
       `(3) Transfer of account incident to divorce: The transfer of 
     an individual's interest in an individual investment account to 
     his former spouse under a divorce decree or under a written 
     instrument incident to a divorce shall not be considered a 
     taxable transfer made by such individual notwithstanding any 
     other provision of this subtitle, and such interest at the time 
     of the transfer shall be treated as an individual investment 
     account of such spouse and not of such individual. Thereafter 
     such account shall be treated, for purposes of this subtitle,  
     as maintained for the benefit of such spouse. 
   `(d) Tax Treatment of Accounts:  
       `(1) Exemption from tax: An individual investment account 
     shall be exempt from taxation under this subtitle unless such 
     account has ceased to be such an account by reason of paragraph 
     (2). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, any such account 
     shall be subject to the taxes imposed by section 511 (relating 
     to imposition of tax on unrelated business income of  
     charitable, etc. organizations). 
       `(2) Loss of exemption of account where individual engages in 
     prohibited transaction: 
           `(A) In general: If, during any taxable year of the 
         individual for whose benefit the individual investment 
         account is established, that individual engages in any 
         transaction prohibited by section 4975 with respect to the 
         account, the account shall cease to be an individual 
         investment account as of the first day of that taxable year. 
           `(B) Account treated as distributing all its assets: In 
         any case in which any account ceases to be an individual 
         investment account by reason of subparagraph (A) on the 
         first day of any taxable year, paragraph (1) of subsection 
         (c) shall be applied as if there were a distribution on  
         such first day in an amount equal to the fair market value 
         (on such first day) of all assets in the account (on such 
         first day). 
       `(3) Effect of pledging account as security: If, during any 
     taxable year, an individual for whose benefit an individual 
     investment account is established uses the account or any 
     portion thereof as security for a loan, the portion so used 
     shall be treated as distributed to that individual. 
       `(4) Rollover contributions: Paragraph (1) shall not apply to 
     any amount paid or distributed out of an individual investment 
     account to the individual for whose benefit the account is 
     maintained if such amount is paid into another individual 
     investment account for the benefit of such individual not later 
     than the 60th day after the day on which he receives the  
     payment or distribution. 
   `(e) Cost-of-Living Adjustment:  
       `(1) In general: In the case of any taxable year beginning in 
     a calendar year after 1992, the dollar amount contained in 
     subsection (c)(2)(B) shall be increased by an amount equal to-- 
           `(A) such dollar amount, multiplied by 
           `(B) the cost-of-living adjustment determined under 
         section 1(f)(3) for the calendar year in which the taxable 
         year begins. 
       `(2) Rounding: If any dollar amount (as increased under 
     paragraph (1)) is not a multiple of $10, such dollar amount 
     shall be increased to nearest multiple of $10 (or, if such 
     dollar amount is a multiple of $5 and not of $10, such dollar 
     amount shall be increased to next higher multiple of $10). 
   `(f) Custodial Accounts: For purposes of this section, a  
 custodial account shall be treated as a trust if the assets of such 
 account are held by a bank (as defined in section 408(n)) or  
 another person who demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the 
 Secretary, that the manner in which he will administer the account 
 will be consistent with the requirements of this section, and if  
 the custodial account would, except for the fact that it is not a 
 trust, constitute an individual investment account described in 
 subsection (b). For purposes of this title, in the case of a 
 custodial account treated as a trust by reason of the preceding 
 sentence, the custodian of such account shall be treated as the 
 trustee thereof. 
   `(g) Reports: The trustee of an individual investment account 
 shall make such reports regarding such account to the Secretary and 
 to the individual for whose benefit the account is maintained with 
 respect to contributions, distributions, and such other matters as 
 the Secretary may require under regulations. The reports required  
 by this subsection shall be filed at such time and in such manner 
 and furnished to such individuals at such time and in such manner  
 as may be required by those regulations.' 
   (b) Deduction Allowed in Arriving at Adjusted Gross Income: 
 Subsection (a) of section 62 of such Code (defining adjusted gross 
 income) is amended by inserting after paragraph (15) the following 
 new paragraph: 
       `(16) Individual investment account contributions: The 
     deduction allowed by section 220 (relating to individual 
     investment accounts).' 
   (c) Individual Investment Accounts Exempt From Estate Tax: Part 
 III of subchapter A of chapter 11 of such Code is amended by 
 redesignating section 2046 as section 2047 and by inserting after

   `Notwithstanding any other provision of law, there shall be 
 excluded from the value of the gross estate of the value of any 
 individual investment account (as defined in section 220(b)). 
 Section 1014 shall not apply to such accounts.'

 Investment Account: Part III of subchapter B of chapter 1 of such 
 Code is amended by inserting after section 121 the following new 
 section:

 the date of the sale or exchange, such property has been owned and 
 used by the taxpayer as his principal residence for periods 
 aggregating 3 years or more. 
   `(b) Limitation: The amount of gain excluded from gross income 
 under subsection (a) shall not exceed the amount paid in cash 
 (during the 1-year period beginning on the date of the sale or 
 exchange) to an individual investment account (as defined in  
 section 220(b)) established for the benefit of the taxpayer or his 
 spouse. 
   `(c) Certain Rules On Ownership and Use To Apply: Rules similar  
 to the rules of section 121(d) shall apply for purposes of

     individual for whose benefit an individual investment account  
     is established shall be exempt from the tax imposed by this 
     section with respect to any transaction concerning such account

     respect to such transaction, the account ceases to be an 
     individual investment account by reason of the application of 
     section 220(d)(2)(A) to such account.'; and 
       (2) by inserting `or an individual investment account

    year and is made not later than the time prescribed by law for 
    filing the return for such taxable year (not including 
    extensions thereof). 
  `(c) Tax Treatment of Distributions:  
      `(1) In general: Except as otherwise provided in this 
    subsection, any amount distributed out of an individual 
    investment account shall be included in gross income by the 
    distributee unless such amount is part of a qualified 1st-time 
    homebuyer distribution. 
      `(2) Qualified 1st-time homebuyer distribution: For purposes 
    of this subsection-- 
          `(A) In general: The term `qualified 1st-time homebuyer 
        distribution' means any payment or distribution received by 
        a 1st-time homebuyer from an individual investment account 
        to the extent such payment or distribution is used by the 
        individual within 60 days to pay qualified acquisition  
        costs with respect to a principal residence for such 
        individual. 
          `(B) Dollar limitation: The aggregate amount which may be 
        treated as qualified 1st-time homebuyer distributions for 
        all taxable years shall not exceed $15,000. 
          `(C) Basis reduction: The basis of any principal  
        residence described in subparagraph (A) shall be reduced by 
        the amount of any qualified 1st-time homebuyer distribution. 
          `(D) Definitions: For purposes of this paragraph-- 
              `(i) Qualified acquisition costs: The term `qualified 
            acquisition costs' means the costs of acquiring, 
            constructing, or reconstructing a residence. Such term 
            includes any usual or reasonable settlement, financing, 
            or other closing costs. 
              `(ii) 1st-time homebuyer: The term `1st-time 
            homebuyer' means any individual if such individual had 
            no present ownership interest in a principal residence 
            during the 3-year period ending on the date of 
            acquisition of the principal residence to which this 
            paragraph applies. 
              `(iii) Principal residence: The term `principal 
            residence' has the same meaning as when used in section 
            1034. 
      `(3) Transfer of account incident to divorce: The transfer of 
    an individual's interest in an individual investment account to 
    his former spouse under a divorce decree or under a written 
    instrument incident to a divorce shall not be considered a 
    taxable transfer made by such individual notwithstanding any 
    other provision of this subtitle, and such interest at the time 
    of the transfer shall be treated as an individual investment 
    account of such spouse and not of such individual. Thereafter 
    such account shall be treated, for purposes of this subtitle,  
    as maintained for the benefit of such spouse. 
  `(d) Tax Treatment of Accounts:  
      `(1) Exemption from tax: An individual investment account 
    shall be exempt from taxation under this subtitle unless such 
    account has ceased to be such an account by reason of paragraph 
    (2). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, any such account 
    shall be subject to the taxes imposed by section 511 (relating 
    to imposition of tax on unrelated business income of  
    charitable, etc. organizations). 
      `(2) Loss of exemption of account where individual engages in 
    prohibited transaction: 
          `(A) In general: If, during any taxable year of the 
        individual for whose benefit the individual investment 
        account is established, that individual engages in any 
        transaction prohibited by section 4975 with respect to the 
        account, the account shall cease to be an individual 
        investment account as of the first day of that taxable year. 
          `(B) Account treated as distributing all its assets: In 
        any case in which any account ceases to be an individual 
        investment account by reason of subparagraph (A) on the 
        first day of any taxable year, paragraph (1) of subsection 
        (c) shall be applied as if there were a distribution on  
        such first day in an amount equal to the fair market value 
        (on such first day) of all assets in the account (on such 
        first day). 
      `(3) Effect of pledging account as security: If, during any 
    taxable year, an individual for whose benefit an individual 
    investment account is established uses the account or any 
    portion thereof as security for a loan, the portion so used 
    shall be treated as distributed to that individual. 
      `(4) Rollover contributions: Paragraph (1) shall not apply to 
    any amount paid or distributed out of an individual investment 
    account to the individual for whose benefit the account is 
    maintained if such amount is paid into another individual 
    investment account for the benefit of such individual not later 
    than the 60th day after the day on which he receives the  
    payment or distribution. 
  `(e) Cost-of-Living Adjustment:  
      `(1) In general: In the case of any taxable year beginning in 
    a calendar year after 1994, the dollar amount contained in 
    subsection (c)(2)(B) shall be increased by an amount equal to-- 
          `(A) such dollar amount, multiplied by 
          `(B) the cost-of-living adjustment determined under 
        section 1(f)(3) for the calendar year in which the taxable 
        year begins, by substituting `1994' for `1989' in 
        subparagraph (B) thereof. 
      `(2) Rounding: If any dollar amount (as increased under 
    paragraph (1)) is not a multiple of $10, such dollar amount 
    shall be increased to nearest multiple of $10 (or, if such 
    dollar amount is a multiple of $5 and not of $10, such dollar 
    amount shall be increased to next higher multiple of $10). 
  `(f) Custodial Accounts: For purposes of this section, a  
custodial account shall be treated as a trust if the assets of such 
account are held by a bank (as defined in section 408(n)) or  
another person who demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the 
Secretary, that the manner in which he will administer the account 
will be consistent with the requirements of this section, and if  
the custodial account would, except for the fact that it is not a 
trust, constitute an individual investment account described in 
subsection (b). For purposes of this title, in the case of a 
custodial account treated as a trust by reason of the preceding 
sentence, the custodian of such account shall be treated as the 
trustee thereof. 
  `(g) Reports: The trustee of an individual investment account 
shall make such reports regarding such account to the Secretary and 
to the individual for whose benefit the account is maintained with 
respect to contributions, distributions, and such other matters as 
the Secretary may require under regulations. The reports required  
by this subsection shall be filed at such time and in such manner 
and furnished to such individuals at such time and in such manner  
as may be required by those regulations.'

Subsection (a) of section 62 of such Code (defining adjusted gross 
income) is amended by adding at the end thereof the following new

  `Notwithstanding any other provision of law, there shall be 
excluded from the value of the gross estate of the value of any 
individual investment account (as defined in section 220(b)). 
Section 1014 shall not apply to such accounts.' 
  (d) Nonrecognition of Gain on Sale of Principal Residence Where

  `(b) Limitation: The amount of gain excluded from gross income 
under subsection (a) shall not exceed the amount paid in cash 
(during the 1-year period beginning on the date of the sale or 
exchange) to an individual investment account (as defined in  
section 220(b)) established for the benefit of the taxpayer or his 
spouse. 
  `(c) Certain Rules On Ownership and Use To Apply: Rules similar  
to the rules of section 121(d) shall apply for purposes of 
determining ownership and use under this section.'

    (which would otherwise be taxable under this section) if, with 
    respect to such transaction, the account ceases to be an 
    individual investment account by reason of the application of 
    section 220(d)(2)(A) to such account.'; and 
      (2) by inserting `or an individual investment account 
    described in section 220(b)' in subsection (e)(1) after

<P>
Dear Colleague:
<P>
I have re-introduced the Individual Investment Account Act-H.R.
328 in the 104th Congress-to make long overdue improvements to
our tax law to boost personal savings.
<P>
This legislation provides for unlimited tax deductions for IRA-type
savings, tax-deferred earnings growth, no penalty tax, no forced
distribution at any age, and no income tax or estate tax at death.
 Ordinary income taxes are paid solely when withdrawals take place
from the Investment Account into the first purchase of a principal
residence and the tax-free roll-over into the Investment Account
of the proceeds from the sale of a principal residence.
<P>
As we all know, personal savings is far too low for our nation's
economy to achieve robust economic growth and increased national
wealth.  A major impeding factor is the senseless &quot;double
tax&quot; on savings imposed by the ordinary income tax.  Under
the &quot;double tax,&quot; personal income is first taxed when
earned.  Then, if the resulting post-tax disposable income is
used for consumption of goods and services, no further federal
income taxes are imposed.  If the income is saved, the earnings
that accrue to the savings are taxed again.  Thus, the cost of
saving is higher than the cost of consumption-a policy which needlessly
restricts both savings and growth.
<P>
I believe the differential in the tax treatment of savings vs.
consumption can best be resolved by creating a universal, unlimited,
tax-deductible, IRA-type plan as provided in H.R. 328.  This bill
removes the income tax's recognized bias against saving.  I urge
you to read the article on this plan written by syndicated columnist
Donald Lambro and provided on the back of this Dear Colleague.
 (H.R. 3179 of the 103rd Congress is identical to H.R. 328.)
<P>
If you are interested in encouraging savings and promoting economic
growth, please call Heather Hanson of my staff (x52777) to join
me as a cosponsor of H.R. 328.
<P>
Sincerely,<p>

<title>Letter from John Breaux</title>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#2F4F2F" vlink="#3232CD">
<center><b><i><font size = +2>United States Senate</font></i></b>
<br>Washington, DC 20510-1803</center>
<p>
<center>March 24, 1995</center><p>
<p>
<p>
<pre>
Dear Colleague: <p>

As you well know, we in Congress have been deeply concerned about the very
low level of saving within the United States.  As a result, there have
been many bills introduced in this 104th Congress to increase personal
saving.  A number of Senators have cosponsored more than one. 

<p>

In addressing this vital need to increase household saving, and the
related tax revenue impact arising therefrom, it is important to recognize
a position that is widely accepted by economists:  the ordinary income tax
is biased against savings and favors consumption.  Thus, the only
remaining questions are:  how bad is the bias; how can we correct it; is
the government's tax revenue impacted; and what are the economic losses or
gains from change? 

<p>

This letter applies to a bill I have sponsored, S. 159.  This legislation
is unique in a number of ways, Most importantly, S. 159 totally removes
the income tax bias against personal saving in a simple, sound way.  My
legislation would permit unlimited tax deductible contributions to
Individual Investment Accounts (IIAs) by all taxpayers. 

<p>

Please review the enclosed summary of S. 159 and article by the Institute
for Research on the Economics of Taxation (IRET) which describes S. 159 as
&quot;...one of the boldest, most imaginative, and most constructive
pro-growth tax initiatives in many years.&quot; 

<p>

I hope that you will join me in this effort by cosponsoring S. 159. 
Please contact Geoff Culbertson (4-4623) for any additional information. 

                                      Sincerely, 


                                      JOHN BREAUX
                                      United States Senator

Americans for Tax Reform, Washington, D.C.<br></FONT></CENTER>
<P>
&quot;The right to pursue personal liberty, opportunity and economic prosperity is the promise of America.  To create new jobs and increase the standard of living for all, we must relieve the punitive tax burden on productive Americans who invest in their fellow men.  Tragically, the existing U.S. tax code penalizes this investment and thereby forestalls economic growth.<br> 
<p>
The Individual Investment Account (IIA) Act corrects this serious flaw - attacks code which has increasingly robbed America of greater GDP growth, new jobs, increased living standards, and even government tax receipts.<br>
<p>
Succinctly, IIAs allow unlimited, fully tax-deductible contributions to IRA-type accounts.  All investment activity is tax free until withdrawn by the saver or beneficiary, thereby eliminating redundant taxation on the same capital.  With IIAs, there are no penalty taxes, no forced distributions, nor estate taxes.<br>
<p>
This common sense bipartisan legislation is the springboard to an American economic renaissance.  All members of Congress, and their constituents, should actively urge its enactment.&quot;<br>

<P>
&quot;America's small business is the powerful economic engine that innovates, creates jobs and spurs economic growth.  The vital fuel for this engine is capital.  Capital is derived from the accumulated and ongoing savings and investments of people.  In fact, there is no other source.<br>
<p>
The existing income tax as applied to personal saving and investing is severely biased against saving and investing.  The effect of this nonsensical bias compounds over time thereby progressively curtailing all economic growth -- and particularly so the job creating growth of small businesses and entrepreneurs.<br>
<p>
The Individual Investment Account Act simply and effectively strips away this tax bias against saving and investing.  IIAs are IRA-type plans that allow each person to contribute unlimited, fully tax-deductible amounts.  Investment activity accumulates tax free until withdrawn by the owner or the beneficiary.  There are no penalty taxes, or forced distributions, nor estate taxes upon death.<br>
<p>
The SBSC urges all voters and their respective members of Congress to actively support this extremely important remedial legislation.&quot;<br>

<P>
&quot;I looked through the proposed savings plan of Senator Breaux and Representative McCrery<br>
[S. 159 &amp; H.R. 328] and agree with its content entirely.<br>
<P>
No country can grow and prosper without a healthy savings rate.  There is a very simple way to raise savings and investment in America.  It is to remove the tax bias against savings by allowing taxpayers unlimited annual contributions to IRA-type plans.<br>
<p>
Several reputable studies have shown conclusively that IRAs in their current form increase personal savings. Removing the caps and expanding the eligibility for tax deductible saving could double America's savings rate overnight.&quot;<br>

<P>
&quot;The ACCF supports IRA-type plans such as those in this Act as a way of encouraging the savings necessary for increased investment.  High levels of investment, particularly in productive equipment, is a key element in increasing U.S. economic growth.  S. 159 and H.R. 328, which provide an unlimited tax deduction for saving and eliminate penalty taxes and forced distributions, could make a significant contribution to our economic future.&quot;<br>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><a name="uscc">Dr. Richard Rahn</a><br>
Former Vice President and Chief Economist of the<br>
Chamber of Commerce of the United States<br>
</FONT></CENTER>
<P>
&quot;As has long been recognized, the United States suffers from a low level of new capital formation which in turn has depressed economic growth.  This lack of capital formation is mainly a result of the U.S. tax code being far more biased against productive saving and investment than our foreign competitors face in their tax laws.  Senator John Breaux and Representative Jim McCrery propose to eliminate much of this tax bias [via the] Individual Investment Account Act, which would establish universal, unlimited, tax deductible IRA-type plans.<br>
<p>
Those members of Congress who are truly committed to reigniting economic growth in America, creating millions of productive new jobs, and reducing poverty and increasing economic opportunity and prosperity, will support this needed legislation.<br>
<p>
There will be those who say it will favor the rich, but they will ignore the fact that a rich man can only benefit from the legislation by productively investing his money and refraining from consumption.  As a result, this investment will create jobs for poor men.<br>
<p>
There will be those who say this legislation will add to the federal deficit.  Such an argument ignores the reality that the federal deficit is in large part a result of too little economic growth, and of increased demand for government support by people without jobs or economic opportunity.  Expanding IRA-type plans over the long run will reduce the federal deficit by increasing jobs, total wage payments, and payroll taxes, and diminishing the need for government payments as a result of expanded economic opportunity.&quot;<br>

Why It's So Hard To Save<br>
<p>
</font>
<b>By Edwin Feulner<br></b>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As any economist can tell you, when you subsidize something, you get more of it.  Give welfare checks to people who don't work, for example, and the number of people who don't work increases.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The flip side is equally clear: if you tax something, you get less of it.  For example, a few years back the government slapped a &quot;luxury&quot; tax on cabin cruisers and yachts costing more than $100,000.  The result: Boat buyers decided not to buy new boats, and several U.S. boat builders went belly up -- throwing their workers into the unemployment line.
<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Which brings me to the point: Just as taxes on new boats kill demand for new boats, taxes on savings lead Americans to save less.  Go ahead, try to squirrel away a few dollars for a rainy day (or a sunny day in Florida or Arizona when you retire).  The government will thwart you at every turn, taxing your savings more heavily than just about anything else in the economy.
<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Think about it: Assume you take $1,000 and put it in a certificate of deposit earning 5 percent.  After one year, you've earned $50.  Now, you already paid steep federal income taxes on that original $1,000 (between 15 percent and 39 percent) when you earned it.  But that's not enough.  The government taxes your modest $50 gain too, leaving only $30.50 in your pocket if you're in the highest tax bracket.
<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Welcome to the tax code: You're taxed when you work for your money, and you're taxed again when your money works for you.  It's one of the worst features of our tax system, taxing people twice on money they're trying to save.
<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
About the only way to get some relief from this double tax burden is through Individual Retirement Accounts (IRA's), which let you sock away a few dollars and have the money earn interest tax-free.
<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But IRAs have their limits, the worst being that the government only lets you contribute $2,000 per year.  The government also slaps you with a steep penalty if you withdraw the money before Uncle Sam says you can (currently age 59-and-a-half), so forget about using the money to buy a home or cope with a financial emergency.  And don't think you can pass the money in your IRA on to your children without going another few rounds with the tax man.  The government forces you to start withdrawing the money at age 70-and-a-half so it can collect income taxes again.  Then when you die, the money falls prey to estate taxes and, when your children finally receive what's leftover, inheritance taxes.
<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Alas, that's Washington: It takes a good idea like saving money -- which provides the capital to grow the economy and create jobs -- and piles on so many regulations, penalties, and layers of taxation that saving hardly becomes worth the effort.  If there's so little reward for thriftiness, why not spend, spend, spend?
<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There's a better way.  A proposal by Tom Kelly, president of the Savers &amp; Investors League of Villanova, Pa., would eliminate the red tape and double taxation that makes saving so hard.  IRAs?  In Kelly's view, they're at best a good start.  He proposes Individual Investment Accounts, a more muscular savings tool that would let you deposit as much of your money as you want tax free (no $2,000 limit), withdraw it for any purpose (hello new house), withdraw it at any age (early retirement anyone?), and let you pass it on to your children with no inheritance or estate taxes (sorry Uncle Sam, my kids come first).
<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It's not a hard concept to grasp: If you want people to save more, you have to tax their savings less.  So no more preaching from politicians about our low national savings rate until they do for savers what they've already done for yacht buyers.

<BLOCKQUOTE>GOP candidate Bob Dole's tax plan has put tax policy squarely at the forefront of the presidential debate this year, but as far as Tom Kelly is concerned, the plan doesn't go far enough.  Kelly, the ebullient founder and president of the Savers and Investor League (SIL), says that &quot;it is a step in the right direction,&quot; but complains that it &quot;doesn't touch the entire question of taxing savings.&quot;<BR>
<P>
&quot;Reducing the income tax on investment return by 15% is certainly an improvement, but is far short of the proper tax reduction of 100%,&quot; says Kelly.  After you have had your wage or salary income taxed once, he observes, &quot;whatever you have left can only be spent or saved.&quot;  If you save it, he argues, the government will continually tax it, penalizing and discouraging savings.  The result, he maintains, is that &quot;the American people are being ripped off.  People ask, 'Why aren't young people saving?'  Well, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure that one out.&quot;<BR>
<P>
According to Kelly, &quot;All of your savings and investments should be tax deductible and tax deferred.&quot;  Accumulating wealth in the form of either savings or investments, Kelly says, &quot;is the only way to become self-sufficient.  Penalizing savings takes away our self-sufficiency.&quot;<BR>
<P>
The Savers and Investors League lobbies Congress to change the antisavings bias of the tax code, while its affiliated Savers &amp; Investors Foundation carries out research on the impact of taxes on the American economy, taxpayers and government.  The mission of SIL, says Kelly, is to &quot;educate and motivate grassroots voters/taxpayers to challenge and change the way our government measures the tax revenue impact of tax-deferred savings.&quot;<BR>
<P>
A self-described &quot;entrepreneurial businessman,&quot; Kelly founded SIL in 1988 after a run-in with government destroyed his investment business.  &quot;This is not my vocation.  It's a labor of love, believe me.  I refuse to accept the notion that our government and our people can let this happen.&quot;<BR>
<P>
Kelly had been in business 15 years selling policyowner self-directed variable annuities when the IRS and Treasury Department obtained a court ruling overturning 70 previous rulings favorable to firms such as Kelly's and shut it down.  Kelly sued, and the U.S. District Court agreed with him, stating that the Treasury and IRS rulings were in fact arbitrary, capricious, illegal, and unreasonable and that the IRS had usurped the power of Congress.<BR>
<P>
In response to an IRS-Treasury petition, the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled, as technical matter and not on the substance of the suit, that the District Court did not have jurisdiction and overturned its decision.  Kelly hired Robert Bork, then a Yale Law School professor, to assist with his appeal to the Supreme Court, but, without stating its reasons, the Supreme Court refused to accept the case.  Thus, the Treasury and IRS won - but not on the merits of their tax law position - and Kelly was forced to liquidate his business in 1978.<BR>
<P>
This experience prompted Kelly to become an activist and after studying up on the matter, Kelly &quot;concluded that the way our nation taxes savings is absolutely, flat-out stupid.&quot;  The current mode of taxing, he argues, &quot;not only kills the accumulated capital and savings of individuals and collectively, our nation, it also kills the tax base of our government, and the government collects less taxes than they otherwise would...  Our nation has lost trillions and trillions of dollars of economic growth because of it.&quot;<BR>
<P>
Kelly does not fault legislators, who are not economists, for failing to understand the economics involved, but thinks that once tax policy got off track, precedent and habit kept it there.  He lays partial blame on accounting practices that began with the Budget Act of 1974, which basically assumes that all money somehow belongs to the government and that failure to tax any existing account, such as personal savings, is a government &quot;tax-expenditure.&quot;<BR>
<P>
As a result, says Kelly, government tax policy views allowing individuals to keep and save their own money as a subsidy.  &quotThis is 100% wrong!&quot; he says.<BR>
<P>
Observing that all the other major economic powers largely exempt savings and capital gains from taxation, Kelly sees his efforts beginning to bear fruit here as well.  SIL test mailings have shown tremendous popular support for the idea of tax-deferred savings, Kelly says, and &quot;we have a bill [H.R. 328 and S. 159] introduced, with very good sponsorship in Congress.  It's sponsored by John Breaux [D. - La.] in the Senate and Jim McCreary [R. - La.] in the House, and has a lot of support.  Dick Armey [R. - Tex.], who's an economist, is a cosponsor.&quot;<BR>
<P>
&quot;This whole taxation of savings question is right on the front burner,&quot; says Kelly, noting that all major tax proposals now include some form of totally tax-exempt savings, including The USA Tax Act (S. 722) sponsored by Senators Pete Domenici [R. - N.M.] and Sam Nunn [D. - Ga.].  &quot;I believe it's just like the Berlin Wall.  No one thought the Berlin Wall would ever come down, but because it was built on quicksand - poof! - the whole thing imploded, and the wall came down.  The same thing's going to happen with the way our nation taxes savings.&quot;<BR>

<FONT SIZE=4>They Might Help But They Aren't Sufficient</FONT><BR>
</CENTER>
<P>
Washington, D.C., August 7, 1996 - U.S. savers and investors, individually and collectively, suffer under an oppressive tax system; one that doubles, triples and quadruples the taxes applied to the same investment return or gain.  Whoever labeled investment return or gain as &quot;unearned income&quot; had to have a sinister sense of humor.  Securing a reasonable income from saving and investing is not an easy task, and is one that calls for eternal vigilance.
<P>
Reducing the income tax on investment return by 15% is certainly an improvement but is far short of the proper tax reduction of 100%.  After you have had your wage or salary income taxed, whatever you have left can only be spent or saved.  If you spend it there is no investment income for Uncle Sam to tax year after year thereafter.  If you save it, you are creating economic growth for yourself and everyone else - including the government.  It is this added economic growth, derived solely from increased saving, that creates more jobs, and more production at lower costs, and higher standards of living for everyone - including the saver.  All of this expanded economic activity also creates more tax dollars for Uncle Sam than otherwise collected under the annual income tax as applied to saving.
<P>
You don't have to be a rocket scientist to accept the fact that eliminating the tax on saving will increase our peoples rate of saving significantly.
<P>
Is it any wonder all economists recognize the existing inherent tax bias against saving.  A 15% reduction in that bias against investment income is only a small step in the right direction.

<TITLE>The Right Tax Plan For Dole </TITLE>

<i>The Right Tax Plan For Dole</i></font><br>
By VICTOR A. CANTO<br>
</center>
<blockquote>
<p>
Less than a month before the Republican Convention, Bob Dole has yet to present a tax-cut plan.  Why?  Most likely because he hasn't seen one he likes.  The answer may be an unlimited, front-loaded individual retirement account.
<p>
Everyone expects a Republican candidate to set down a tax-cut plan.  And, aside from naming a running mate, a tax cut is Dole's best chance for a fresh, strong appeal to the voters.  But he needs a plan that makes economic sense, wins support within his party and in the country at large and also fits with the Dole we all know.
<p>
The right IRA reforms fill that bill.  They would open a new opportunity for all Americans to save, boosting our national rates of saving and investing, and thus economic growth.  The plan would promote economic efficiency by taxing each economic transaction only once and by end-running the job-killing capital gains tax.
<p>
Early in the campaign, Dole commissioned a group headed by Jack Kemp to draw up a tax plan for the future.  Kemp landed on a refined version of the Hall-Rabushka flat tax.  Dole balked at that, though he has supported a flatter tax structure over the years.
<p>
Kemp then threw his support to Steve Forbes, who based his surprisingly successful campaign on the flat tax.  But when Forbes left the race, so too did the flat tax.
<p>
An unlimited, front-loaded IRA plan can reap some of the benefits of a flat tax - but has stronger political &quot;wings.&quot  It would increase our nation's savings rate and also free up cash trapped in slow-performing investments.
<p>
Current law limits each of us to a maximum IRA contribution of $2,000 a year.  Income taxes don't apply to the money paid into the fund, but do to the money withdrawn from it.
<p>
The $2,000 limit is an arbitrary figure.  Raising it - increasing the chance for tax-deferred investment - would likely boost our national savings rate, which many analysts say is too low.  Removing the limit altogether should boost the savings rate considerably.
<p>
But IRAs are limited for a reason: the fear that, given the chance, too many people would defer too many taxes for too many years.  The loss of tax revenues, though temporary, would seem to increase the federal budget deficit.
<p>
We can solve that problem by front-loading the IRA - by taxing money as it goes into the fund, not as it is withdrawn.
<p>
Think of the tax on IRAs as a sales tax - a tax that is levied when people spend money, rather than when they earn it.  A tax imposed at the end of the time of possession is said to be &quot;back-loaded.&quot;
<p>
A front-loaded tax, by contrast, resembles an income tax, levied when people earn money.  The tax is levied as money is placed into the account, not when it is removed.
<p>
The two taxes generate equivalent amounts of revenue for the government - but the timing of the actual tax receipts is quite different.  Front-loading generates revenue sooner, back-loading later.
<p>
Either way, the program delivers the same amount to the saver at retirement.
<p>
The government could generate extra tax revenues by adding one more twist: allowing all current IRA holders to convert their accounts to the new program.  this would generate a one-time revenue windfall.
<p>
The unlimited, front-loaded IRA indirectly addresses another issue dear to Republican hearts; the capital gains tax.
<p>
The plan adheres to the single taxation philosophy.  Under it, all income earned on the IRA would be tax-free.  The sale of assets in the account would also be tax-free, provided the proceeds are reinvested in the IRA.
<p>
The unlimited IRA is a way to prospectively unlock capital gains and allow for a more efficient resource allocation.  And the &quot;front-loading&quot; feature avoids the need to index gains for inflation, because gains within the retirement account would be liquidated without additional taxes.
<p>
In short, the unlimited, front-loaded IRA provides a way to defuse the capital gains issue, while delivering most of the benefits of single taxation and indexation.
<p>
In is also a way to help each American save for his or her own retirement - a cause Bob Dole can support with real enthusiasm.

<TITLE> Is a Balanced Budget the Key... </TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>

<hr>
<font size=6>Is a Balanced Budget the Key to<br>
Our Economic Future?<br>
</font>
<b>by CHARLES I. PLOSSER</b>
</center>
<hr>
<p>
I am probably not much different from most of you when I say that I listened - first with interest, then with laughter, and finally with complete dismay - to the verbal sparring among supposedly bright and able politicians during the recent budget debates.
<p>
<ul>
<li> Why must we be subjected to all the nonsensical and misleading posturing intended to gain support in the overnight opinion surveys by pitting one interest group against another?
<p>
<li> Why does the Secretary of the Treasury incite the fear of default on U.S. debt obligations when he knows fully well that there is no immediate threat?
<p>
<li> Why should members of Congress take the ludicrous stand that the budget must be balanced in seven years - not six, eight, or none, but seven and only seven years?
</ul>
...
<p>
If you could cut through all of the political grandstanding and use of the media to pander to specific interest groups, you would find, of course, claims that important philosophical issues are at stake.  These issues involve fundamental questions over the role and size of government and the structure of the tax system.  Indeed, that is where the real issues lie.
<p>
Unfortunately, these important questions are unlikely to be resolved or to dramatically change the way government affects the allocation of resources during the current Congress.  The very nature  of the legislative process, which entails compromise and a strong preference for the status quo, makes progress difficult and slow.  Instead, the Congress, Administration and policy gurus have, as a practical matter, chosen to make the budget deficit the focal point for the debate.
<p>
...
<p>
Attempting to reduce the deficit, of course, leads to a debate over the nature of the spending reductions and/or tax changes required to accomplish this goal.  The real danger of making deficit reduction the yardstick by which we measure the success of the budget process is that we may succeed in reducing the deficit, but not in resolving the more fundamental problems.
<p>
...
<p>
If I asked a group of Americans why they thought the budget deficit was a problem, I would get a variety of different answers.  But I think a common thread in their answers would be a concern over the health of our economy and the fear that our current high standard of living is likely to be at the expense of not just our own future, but that of our children and generations to come.
<p>
This is a real and justifiable concern.  But the fact is that even if we eliminate the budget deficit - however good that may make us feel - we will not necessarily deal a decisive blow to these more deeply rooted concerns.  In fact, eliminating the deficit is not even the most important step that the government can take towards addressing these concerns.  Much more important than the magnitude of the deficit - and whether it goes to zero in seven years, ten years or at all - is where and how the government spends the resources it takes from us and the nature of the incentives created by the way those revenues are raised.
<p>
If we wish to ensure the health and well-being of our future and that of our children, then we must increase the amount of savings and productive investments we undertake today so that we achieve continued growth of our standard of living.   Slow growth in domestic investment means slower growth in the amount of capital per worker.  This means slower growth in labor productivity and slower growth in real wages.  Make no mistake about it, growth is the key.  The difference between an economy that grows at 2 percent a year and one that grows at 3 percent a year becomes enormous due to compounding.  After 30 years the economy growing at 2 percent is about 80 percent wealthier while the economy growing at 3 percent is almost 150 percent wealthier.
<p>
I am troubled that too many people, in and out of government, are under the misguided impression that, as soon as we balance the budget, we can start congratulating ourselves for saving the nation from economic calamity and moral degradation.
<p>
You have no doubt heard or read that Americans don't save enough.  Among the major developed countries of the world, the U.S. has one of the lowest rates of gross saving.  For example, gross national saving as a percentage of GDP is 33 percent in Japan, 29 percent in Switzerland, 20 percent in Germany, 19 percent in France and only about 14 percent in the U.S.  This relatively low rate of saving means that any investment in productive capacity that exceeds our domestic savings must be supplied by foreigners.  Low domestic saving is the primary cause of our trade deficit - not the fact that some foreign markets are more closed to U.S. goods than we would like.
<p>
If we think of savings as the resource we choose to set aside for investment, then the investment rate represents that portion of output actually invested.  Here again, the U.S. has one of the lowest investment rates among the major industrial countries.  For example, gross fixed capital formation as a percentage of GPD is 31 percent in Japan, 23 percent in Germany, 21 percent in France, but only about 15 percent in the U.S.
<p>
...
<p>
...if we are not careful about how we shrink the deficit we could easily do so in a way that could actually make our low savings and investment patterns worse.  By increasing the tax on savings and investment and directing more government spending toward consumption or to entitlements for individuals with high rates of consumption, we could reduce the deficit but would actually further reduce the motivation to save and invest for the future.
<p>
As a matter of fact, our budget deficit is simply not that big relative to other countries, even countries that have substantially higher savings and investment rates.
<p>
...
<p>
If the deficit is the wrong focus for the debate, how should we think about addressing the real concerns about our economic future?  There are, of course, many factors that influence our individual decisions to save and invest.  It is important that Congress and the American people debate the impact of government spending decisions and tax policies, not simply in terms of their impact on the budget deficit, but in terms of their impact on investment and saving, and thus our ability to grow and enhance our standard of living.
<p>
Under the current patterns of spending and taxation, our government systematically biases individuals away from saving and investing and towards consumption.  This bias in the way the government spends our tax dollars and the way it raises those dollars is a significant contribution to the lower savings patterns that exist here relative to other industrialized nations.
<p>
...
<p>
Our current system which relies heavily on the income tax, is a system that taxes income that we use for consumer purchases only once, but taxes income that we save two and sometimes three times.  For example, under the income tax, wages, salaries, dividends, interest and capital gains are all taxed as personal income.  If we spend that money on a new car, there is no further income tax liability on the car or on the return or value we get from driving the car.
<p>
On the other hard, if we take those same after-tax dollars and save them or invest them in a business, then the return or the value received for those savings is taxed first at the level of the business and is then taxed again when the business distributes the profits back to the investors in the form of dividends or capital gains.  This system penalizes saving and investing and thus encourages consumption.  Since interest on debt is tax deductible to the business, this system also favors debt over equity as a means of financing business expansion.
<p>
For these reasons, economists have long argued in favor of some sort of consumption tax that would not have the same disincentives to save.  Under a consumption tax all savings would be exempt from tax until they were used to consume goods and services.  This approach is in sharp contrast to the current income tax, which penalizes future consumption by taxing it more heavily.
<p>
...
<p>
In the past, there has never been a strong political constituency for tax reform.  After all, as George Bernard Shaw once said, &quot;A government that robs Peter to pay Paul can always count on the support of Paul.&quot;  In this case, we are denying the benefits of our investments to future generations who, to my knowledge, have not yet found a lobbyist to represent their interests and thus seem to be easy prey for the government looking for someone to tax.
<p>
There is now an increasing awareness that fundamental tax reform is important if we are to come to grips with our low savings and under-investment problems.  We are coming to realize that deficit reduction alone is likely to result in a bitterly disappointing change in our savings patterns.
<p>
...
<p>
...we can rest assured that every group that believes they have a vested interest in specific provisions of the current tax code will argue strongly for preserving the status quo.  Who we won't hear from are those whose wages and living standards will be raised by the increase in capital a less distortionary tax code would promote.  These individuals are not nearly so organized - some of them haven't even been born.
<p>
We must come to grips with the concern that we are not investing enough to ensure real growth in capital and labor productivity that will enhance real wages and living standards in the future.  Additionally, we must also tackle the fundamental issue of tax reform.  If we reduce the deficit without reducing the double and triple taxation on savings and investment, we will have failed.  If the 1996 Presidential campaign does not make tax reform a defining issue, we will miss the greatest opportunity for fundamental tax reform since the 16th Amendment, which created the income tax 82 years ago.
<p>
There is little doubt in my mind that in the short run, the prospects for the economy are good.  The long run opportunities, however, are more troublesome.  We must move beyond the simple-minded and misguided forces on a balanced budget and come to grips with the underlying weakness in our savings and investment patterns that threatens the standard of living of our children.  The current debates in Washington have opened a small crack in the door of the entrenched interests of the bureaucracy that invites a serious discussion of these fundamental concerns.  Combine this with the fact that 1996 is a presidential election year and we have perhaps a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to make fundamental tax reform a major political issue.  The political risks will be high, but so could the economic rewards to the nation.  It should make for a very interesting 1996.

The Institute for Research on the Economics of Taxation (IRET) is a 
non-profit, non-partisan, tax exempt 501(c)(3) public policy research 
organization devoted to informing the public about economic policies, 
especially those concerning the federal tax system, that will contribute 
to economic growth, efficiency and competitiveness.  To this end, IRET 
provides policy makers in the private as well as the public sector with 
objective, closely-reasoned analyses of the economic effects of public 
economic policy initiatives.<br>
<p>
Constructive public policies, in IRET's view, are those that reduce 
government interference in the operation of the private, free market 
system.  Such policies must recognize two basic facts of American 
economic life - one, that individuals' decisions about personal effort, 
saving, investment, and consumption, as reflected in voluntary and free 
exchange in the market place, provide the signals for efficient conduct 
of business, and two, that business is the prime mover on which the 
nation's economic progress depends.<br>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I><B>... a tax deduction for income that is saved ... can be incorporated in a complete overhaul of the income tax [or] adopted as a stand-alone measure that would accomplish a large part of the tax restructuring agenda, but without some of the complications of a full-scale rewriting of the tax code.</CENTER> </B></I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>

<P>
Tax time has rolled around again, and the income tax bias against saving continues to depress economic growth, wages, and personal income.  In January, the National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform called for elimination of the income tax bias against saving.  The commission's report reviewed several generic approaches to providing neutral tax treatment for saving and investment.  One approach is to allow a tax deduction for income that is saved, deferring tax on that income until it is withdrawn at a later date for consumption.  Such an approach can be incorporated in a complete overhaul of the income tax.  Alternatively, it can be adopted as a stand-alone measure that would accomplish a large part of the tax restructuring agenda, but without some of the complications of a full-scale rewriting of the tax code.<br>
<p>
Such a stand-alone measure has already been introduced in the Congress by Senator John Breaux (D-LA) as S. 159, and by Representative Jim McCrery (R-LA) as H.R. 328.  Their bills, based on a proposal by the Savers &amp; Investors League, would permit unlimited tax deductible contributions to individual investment accounts (IIAs) by all taxpayers.<br>
<p>
The Nunn-Domenici tax reform proposal, the Armey flat tax bill, and the American Dream Savings Accounts in the GOP House Contract With America would also reduce the bias against saving to various degrees.  The Nunn-Domenici and Armey reforms are likely to require extended debate before any chance of passage.  The American Dream Savings Accounts would eliminate some of the existing penalties on saving, but only for limited uses.  The Individual Investment Account proposal, on the other hand, is a clean, stand-alone measure that would itself by a major income tax reform.<br>
<P>
Renewed interest in the Congress in reducing the tax bias against
saving is all the more important since enactment of the Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA93). OBRA93 increased
the tax bias against saving by raising individual and corporate
marginal income tax rates, permanently extending phase-outs of
itemized deductions and personal exemptions, tightening rules
limiting contributions to private pension arrangements, and limiting
capital gains treatment of several types of financial transactions.
These provisions are bound to retard private sector saving, capital
formation, and economic growth.
<P>
The Breaux and McCreary bills, similar to the unlimited savings
deduction legislation introduced in the 102nd Congress by Representatives
Dick Schulze (R-PA) and Ed Jenkins (D-GA), continues the campaign for one of
the boldest, most imaginative, and most constructive pro-growth
tax initiatives in many years. The bill would permit taxpayers
to defer taxes on saving without restrictions as to the amount of
saving or time of withdrawal. The bill would all but eliminate
the individual income tax bias against personal saving. It would contribute
to higher levels of saving, investment, productivity, and income
than now exist.
<P>
IIAs would have these features:
<UL>
<LI>Unlimited tax deduction of amounts saved.
<LI>Tax-free investment growth until withdrawal.
<LI>No penalty tax on withdrawal at any age.
<LI>No forced distribution at any age.
<LI>No income tax at death. Heirs may maintain the IIA with the
benefactor's cost basis.
<LI>No estate tax on IIA assets.
<LI>Rollover of up to $15,000 (indexed for inflation) from an
IIA into the first purchase of a principal residence (with an
equal reduction in the tax basis of the house).
<LI>Tax-free rollover into the IIA of the proceeds from the sale
of a principal residence.
<LI>In addition to currently-allowed IRA vehicles, tax deductible
premiums for life insurance if proceeds are payable into an IIA.
</UL>

<P>
IIAs, unlike IRAs, would not be limited to retirement saving.
IRAs have been justified as an incentive for taxpayers to save
for retirement. This is too narrow a focus. IRAs should be thought
of as a very limited means of offsetting the current bias in the
income tax against saving.
<P>
Income is taxed when earned. If the income is used for consumption,
there is no further federal income tax imposed (though there may
be small sales or excise taxes). However, if the income
is saved, the earnings of the saving are taxed repeatedly (and,
if later used for consumption, may also face excise or sales taxes).
The income tax thus raises the cost of saving compared to that
of current consumption.
<P>
A neutral tax code would not penalize saving relative to consumption.
There are two ways to make the taxation of saving and consumption
neutral. Either income that is saved should be exempt from tax
(as in traditional IRAs, 401(k) plans, etc.) and the earnings
of the saving and the principal taxed upon withdrawal, or the
amounts saved should be taxed when earned but the earnings should
be tax exempt (as with tax free securities or the &quot;back-ended&quot;
type of IRA offered in the Bentsen-Roth bill in the 102nd Congress).
<P>
The bias in the income tax extends to all taxable saving, not
just that for retirement. To create a neutral tax
system, all saving, whether for retirement, buying a house, college
tuition, a new car, or protection against a rainy
day, should receive the same treatment as in a tax-deferred income
plan.
<P>
IRAs, as currently constituted, have several short-comings. There
are limits on the amounts that can be deducted. Consequently,
IRAs give no added incentive to save to those who are already
doing long-term saving in amounts above the limits. Amounts withdrawn
from an IRA before age 59-1/2 are subject to a penalty in addition
to tax. This makes IRAs unattractive to lower income savers who
cannot afford to save separately for emergencies, to buy a home,
to pay tuition and other near-term goals, as well as a more distant
retirement. There is a mandatory age (70-1/2) for beginning to
withdraw from IRAs to force commencement of recapture of the tax
deferral.
<p>
All saving contributes
to capital formation, productivity, and national income, regardless
of the motive behind it. There is no economic reason for the government
to discriminate against or discourage any type of saving.  In addition, paying for the projected costs of providing for the retirement of the baby boom and generation Xers will only be possible if private saving is increased substantially and soon.
<P>
The IIA proposal avoids all these pitfalls. IIAs will
generate a greater incentive to save among upper-income savers,
be of far greater safety and appeal to lower-income savers, and
encourage more saving by the elderly and their heirs than current
IRAs.
<P>
Some might object that the near-term cost to the Treasury would
make unlimited IIAs too expensive for the federal budget. This
fear if groundless for several reasons.
<P>
First, when the contribution to an IIA constitutes new saving
that would not have been done in the absence of the incentive,
there would be no loss to the Treasury over the lifetime of the
IIA. The tax on the contribution would be deferred, not lost.  The contribution would grow with interest, and
the tax on the compounded principal would equal in present value
the tax foregone when the contribution was made. There would be
no loss of tax, relative to current law, from letting the interest
accumulate tax-free, because the saving would not otherwise have
been done, and there would have been no interest to tax without
the IIA treatment.
<P>
Second, insofar as a portion of the saving would have been done
in the absence of the IIA treatment, the deferred tax on the compounded
contribution would be recouped with interest. The annual taxation
of the interest would be foregone, but would be more than offset
as that portion of the IIA which constituted new saving added
to the GNP and raised revenues from other taxes on the added income.
<P>
For the most part, then, the present value of the taxes collected
by the Treasury would not be reduced, only altered in its timing
as a result of IIA treatment of saving.
<p>
 Might the delay in collection
of the tax and greater near-term government borrowing decrease national saving and an increase in &quot;crowding
out&quot; of private borrowing?  In practice, the answer is &quot;No.&quot; The amount of added
government borrowing would equal the IIA contribution times the
taxpayer's marginal tax rate - 15%, 28%, 31%, 36%, etc. If the
fraction of new saving in each IIA contribution equaled the tax
rate, e.g., if $28 of a $100 contribution were new saving by a
middle income contributor, then that saving 
would equal the added borrowing by the government, and national
saving would not fall. The leading researchers into the effect
of traditional IRAs on saving behavior have concluded that some
60% to 80% of IRA saving was new saving by contributors, well
above the minimum needed to produce &quot;crowding in&quot; of
added saving, not crowding out. Similar results would be expected
from IIAs.
<P>
Because IIA saving would in large part be new saving, IIAs would
add to the amount of investment and growth of the economy, and
would raise productivity, employment, wages, and profits. The
added income would be subject to tax. When the higher corporate
and personal income taxes and the added payroll taxes are factored
in, IIAs are seen to be clear revenue raisers for the government
over time.<BR>

The merits of reducing the income tax bias against saving have
become more urgent in light of the work of The Bipartisan Commission
on Entitlement and Tax Reform.  The Commission projects that unless
current policies are changed exploding entitlement spending to
pay for the retirement and health care of the baby boom and subsequent
generations will produce budget deficits that will preempt all
projected private saving early in the next century with devastating
economic consequences.  Increasing private saving now is an urgent
necessity to avoid this outcome.
<P>
Legislation based on a proposal by the Savers &amp; Investors
League would permit unlimited tax deductible contributions to
individual investment accounts (IIAs) by all taxpayers.  Identical
bills embodying this proposal, called the Individual Investment

in the 104th Congress by members of both parties:  by Senator
John  Breaux (D-LA) as S. 159, and by Representative Jim McCrery

<P>
Might the delay in collection of the tax and greater near-term
government borrowing result in a decrease in national saving and
an increase in &quot;crowding out&quot; of private borrowing?
<P>
In practice, the answer is &quot;No.&quot;  The amount of added
government borrowing would equal the IIA contribution times the
taxpayer's marginal tax rate &#190; 15%, 28%, 31%, 36%, etc. 
If the fraction of new saving in each IIA contribution equaled
the tax rate, e.g., if $28 of a $100 contribution were new saving
by a middle income contributor, then that saving would equal the
added borrowing by the government, and national saving would not
fall.  The leading researchers into the effect of traditional
IRAs on saving behavior have concluded that some 60% to 80% of
IRA saving was new saving by contributors, well above the minimum
needed to produce &quot;crowding in&quot; of added saving, not
crowding out.  Similar results would be expected from IIAs.
<P>
Because IIA saving would in large part be new saving, IIAs would
add to the amount of investment and growth of the economy, and
would raise productivity, employment, wages, and profits.  The
added income would be subject to tax.  When the higher corporate
and personal income taxes and the added payroll taxes are factored
in, IIAs are seen to be clear revenue raisers for the government
over time.

<HR>

<P>
The merits of reducing the income tax bias against saving seem
to be gaining bipartisan attention in Washington. Legislation
based on a proposal by the Savers &amp; Investors League would
permit unlimited tax deductible contributions to individual investment
accounts (IIAs) by all taxpayers. Identical bills embodying this
proposal, called the Individual Investment Account Act, have been
introduced in the Senate and the House by members of both parties:
by Senator John Breaux (D-LA) as S. 929, and by Representative
Jim McCrery (R-LA) as H.R. 3179.
<P>
Deferral of tax on any income that is saved is also a key feature
of the Nunn-Domenici tax reform proposal presented on Oct. 5.
The Nunn-Domenici proposal contains additional, major changes
in the income tax to reduce excessive taxation of saving and investment,
but offsets the perceived static revenue loss with higher taxes
on labor. The Nunn-Domenici reform is likely to require extended
debate before any chance of passage. The Individual Investment
Account proposal, on the other hand, is a clean, stand-alone measure
that would itself be a major income tax reform.
<P>
Renewed interest in the Congress in reducing the tax bias against
saving is all the more important since enactment of the Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA93). OBRA93 greatly increased
the tax bias against saving by raising individual and corporate
marginal income tax rates, permanently extending phase-outs of
itemized deductions and personal exemptions, tightening rules
limiting contributions to private pension arrangements, and limiting
capital gains treatment of several types of financial transactions.
These provisions are bound to retard private sector saving, capital
formation, and economic growth.
<P>
The Breaux and McCreary bills, similar to the unlimited savings
deduction legislation introduced in the last Congress by Representatives
Dick Schulze and Ed Jenkins, continues the campaign for one of
the boldest, most imaginative, and most constructive pro-growth
tax initiatives in many years. The bill would permit taxpayers
to defer taxes on saving without restrictions as to amount of
saving or time of withdrawal. The bill would all but eliminate
the income tax bias against individual saving. It would contribute
to higher levels of saving, investment, productivity, and income
than now exist.
<P>
The IIAs would have the following features:
<UL>
<LI>Unlimited tax deduction of amounts saved.
<LI>Tax-free investment growth until withdrawal.
<LI>No penalty tax on withdrawal at any age.
<LI>No forced distribution at any age.
<LI>No income tax at death. Heirs may maintain the IIA with the
benefactor's cost basis.
<LI>No estate tax - IIA assets would be excluded from the gross
estate.
<LI>Rollover of up to $15,000 (indexed for inflation) from an
IIA into the first purchase of a principal residence (with an
equal reduction in the tax basis of the house).
<LI>Tax-free rollover into the IIA of the proceeds from the sale
of a principal residence.
<LI>In addition to currently-allowed IRA vehicles, tax deductible
premiums for life insurance if proceeds are payable into an IIA.
</UL>

<P>
IIAs, unlike IRAs, would not be limited to retirement saving.
IRAs have been justified as an incentive for taxpayers to save
for retirement. This is too narrow a focus. IRAs should be thought
of as a very limited means of offsetting the current bias in the
income tax against saving.
<P>
Income is taxed when earned. If the income is used for consumption,
there is no further federal income tax imposed (though there may
be a small sales or excise tax to be paid). However, if the income
is saved, the earnings of the saving are taxed repeatedly (and,
if later used for consumption, may also face excise or sales taxes).
The income tax thus raises the cost of saving compared to that
of current consumption.
<P>
A neutral tax code would not penalize saving relative to consumption.
There are two ways to make the taxation of saving and consumption
neutral. Either income that is saved should be exempt from tax
(as in traditional IRAs, 401(k) plans, etc.) and the earnings
of the saving and the principal taxed upon withdrawal, or the
amounts saved should be taxed when earned but the earnings should
be tax exempt (as with tax free securities or the &quot;back-ended&quot;
type of IRA offered in the Bentsen-Roth bill in the 102nd Congress).
<P>
The bias in the income tax extends to all taxable saving, not
just that for retirement. Consequently, to create a neutral tax
system., all saving, whether for retirement, buying a house, college
tuition, a new car, a vacation, or protection against a rainy
day, should receive the same treatment as in a tax-deferred income
plan.
<P>
IRAs, as currently constituted, have several short-comings. There
are limits on the amounts that can be deducted. Consequently,
IRAs give no added incentive to save to those who are already
doing long-term saving in amounts above the limits. Amounts withdrawn
from an IRA before age 59-1/2 are subject to a penalty in addition
to tax. This makes IRAs unattractive to lower income savers who
cannot afford to save separately for emergencies, buying a home,
paying tuition and other near-term goals, as well as a more distant
retirement. There is a mandatory age (70-1/2) for beginning to
withdraw from IRAs to force commencement of recapture of the tax
deferral, yet the saving done by the elderly is as economically
valuable as saving done by the young. Indeed, all saving contributes
to capital formation, productivity, and national income, regardless
of the motive behind it. There is no economic reason for the government
to discriminate against or discourage any type of saving.
<P>
The Breaux and McCrery bills avoid all these pitfalls. IIAs will
generate a greater incentive to save among upper-income savers,
be of far greater safety and appeal to lower-income savers, and
encourage more saving by the elderly and their heirs than current
IRAs.
<P>
Some might object that the near-term cost to the Treasury would
make unlimited IIAs too expensive for the federal budget. This
fear if groundless for several reasons.
<P>
First, when the contribution to an IIA constitutes new saving
that would not have been done in the absence of the incentive,
there would be no loss to the Treasury over the lifetime of the
IIA. The tax on the contribution would grow with interest, and
the tax on the compounded principal would equal in present value
the tax foregone when the contribution was made. There would be
no loss of tax, relative to current law, from letting the interest
accumulate tax-free, because the saving would not otherwise have
been done, and there would have been no interest to tax without
the IIA treatment.
<P>
Second, insofar as a portion of the saving would have been done
in the absence of the IIA treatment, the deferred tax on the compounded
contribution would be recouped with interest. The annual taxation
of the interest would be foregone, but would be more than offset
as that portion of the IIA which constituted new saving added
to the GNP and raised revenues from other taxes on the added income.
<P>
For the most part, then, the present value of the taxes collected
by the Treasury would not be reduced, only altered in its timing
as a result of IIA treatment of saving. Might the delay in collection
of the tax and greater near-term government borrowing result in
a decrease in national saving and an increase in &quot;crowding
out&quot; of private borrowing?
<P>
In practice, the answer is &quot;No.&quot; The amount of added
government borrowing would equal the IIA contribution times the
taxpayer's marginal tax rate - 15%, 28%, 31%, 36%, etc. If the
fraction of new saving in each IIA contribution equaled the tax
rate, e.g., if $28 of a $100 contribution were new saving by a
middle income contributor, then the new saving by the contributor
would equal the added borrowing by the government, and national
saving would not fall. The leading researchers into the effect
of traditional IRAs on saving behavior have concluded that some
60% to 80% of IRA saving was new saving by contributors, well
above the minimum needed to produce &quot;crowding in&quot; of
added saving, not crowding out. Similar results would be expected
from IIAs.
<P>
Because IIA saving would in large part be new saving, IIAs would
add to the amount of investment and growth of the economy, and
would raise productivity, employment, wages, and profits. The
added income would be subject to tax. When the higher corporate
and personal income taxes and the added payroll taxes are factored
in, IIAs are seen to be clear revenue raisers for the government
over time.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=5>Tips on Writing a Member of Congress</FONT><BR>
<HR WIDTH=75% ALIGN=center>
</CENTER>
<P>
Senators and Representatives pay attention to their mail.  It is good politics.  Responding to mail is crucial to reelection.  A member knows your vote can be won or lost by his/her response.  The most effective letter is a personal one, not a form letter.  It should be concise, informed, and polite.  Some specific tips:<br>
<P>
1.  Try to stick to one typewritten page.  Two pages at most.  Don't write on the back of a page.  If writing longhand, take care to write legibly.<br>
<p>
2.  In a short first paragraph, state your purpose.  Stick with one subject or issue.  Support your position with the rest of the letter.<br>
<p>
3.  If a bill is the subject, cite it by name and number.<br>
<p>
4.  Be factual and support your position with information about how legislation is likely to affect you and others.  Avoid emotional philosophical arguments.<br>
<p>
5.  If you believe legislation is wrong and should be opposed, say so, indicate the likely adverse effects, and suggest a better approach.<br>
<p>
6.  Ask for the legislator's views but do not demand support.  Remember, Senators and Representatives respond to a variety of views, and even if your position is not supported on one issue or bill, it may be the next time.<br>
<p>
7.  Be sure your name and return address are included and legible.<br>
<p>
8.  The suggested address style is:<br>
<p>
<blockquote>
The Honorable ________________<br>
United States Senate<br>
______________ Senate Office Building<br>
Washington, D.C. 20510<br>
<p>
Dear Senator ________________,<br>

<center>Constituent Clout...The Power of the Pen...</center><br>
</font><hr>
<p>
During a recent symposium on various tax matters to be considered by Congress, an opinion was expressed by a participant that &quot;there's a certain hopelessness about trying to write a letter to Members of Congress and expecting action.&quot;<br>
<p>
Another symposium participant with extensive lobbying experience on the Hill responded as follows as recorded by a court reporter:<br>
<p>
<blockquote>&quot;Let me tell you something:  10 letters, 20 letters to a House Member from his District is a wake up call like you can't believe.  Fifteen telephone calls on one issue in a given two-day period is a wake up call like you can't believe.<br>
<p>
What is very sad about this country is that they---a lot of folks, not everyone---have no clue of the influence they have on their Members of Congress either in the House or the Senate.  Let me tell you, if they sit down and write a letter or they pick up the phone and call that guy, they have a person there who takes count of the calls and what the subject is.  And, that's given to the Member every day, even if he doesn't---does not speak to the Member.<br>
<p>
And all the lobbyists in the world could call in 20 times a day---and I hate to say this in front of my superiors here, but I don't have the influence that 10 people out there calling in from his District who votes in his District will have on that Member.  And that's a definite wake-up call.  All they have to do is pick up the phone.  All they have to do is write a letter.&quot;<br>
<p>
</blockquote>
This commentary is absolutely correct.  You, and your fellow voter/taxpayers within your Congressional District have enormous clout.  Far too often this latent power lies dormant!<br>

Constituent Clout...You Have Political Power!</font></center><br>
<hr>
<p>
Early in 1996, the Sunday New York Times Magazine presented an excellent article that touched on political action.  One paragraph read as follows:<br>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;The N.R.A. doesn't have demonstrations.  They write letters.  In fact, direct action, as a political tactic, is second-choice.  The first choice is to exercise political power, to scare them into voting the right way.  Direct action is what you do when you have no power.  Blacks in the South had to use direct action until they got a voting rights act.  Another problem is, we listen to the critics who say, 'Oh, these politicians don't want to listen to the voters, all they do is listen to campaign contributions.'  In fact, votes will beat money any day.  Any politician forced to choose between his campaign contributors and strong public sentiment is going to vote public sentiment.  Campaign contributions are fungible, you can get new ones.  You can't get new voters.&quot;<br>
<p>
</blockquote>
We, individually and collectively, must exercise our right of protest.  The Savers &amp; Investors League is trying to do its part.  You have political power! Your active participation is vital!<br>

<p>
Welcome.<BR>
<P>
The Savers &amp; Investors League has developed and installed this Web site to help individuals across the country better understand a most serious problem: the irrational taxation of saving and investing.
<P>
Savers and investors do not fare well when it comes to tax legislation.  Not only is the existing income tax severely and improperly biased against saving and investing, savers and investors, as a group, have little political muscle within Congress or Administrations.  This must change.
<P>
There are many excellent organizations and associations that support the needs and desires of savers and investors, such as mutual fund, banking, stock broker, and insurance associations.  However, when priorities are paramount, as is so evident when legislation is formulated, the vital business interests of trade associations, not savers and investors, predominate. 
<P>
Savers and investors are found in all walks of life, in every geographic location, and their interests are fully compatible with the interests of labor; one can't exist and prosper without the other.  It is increasingly being realized that the tax-efficient accumulation of capital is vital to the interests of <EM>all</EM> segments of our society, whether it be labor, capital, or government.  The government produces nothing on its own; its basic sustenance  is from the taxation of capital and labor. When government needlessly and improperly impedes the economic growth of capital, it increasingly impedes the economic growth of labor.  Concurrently, the government  curtails its own tax base.
<P>
The Savers &amp; Investors League is aggressively fighting to remove the government's existing improper and self-defeating tax bias against saving and investing.  The League's activities have political strength directly related to its grass-roots membership within each Congressional District.  Members of Congress do pay attention to the expressed interests of their constituents.  You can easily recognize that each vote counts.  Thus, the League urges and warrants your enthusiastic and active support.  Only by the collective, focused, and sustained action of voter/taxpayers will corrective legislation become law.  The sound taxation of saving and investing will increase jobs and increase our peoples' standard of living.
<P>
 We invite you to explore our Web site.  Read about the actual legislation pending in Congress that could dramatically change the way our Nation taxes your savings and investments.  Review related articles and research reports that support the need for sound, concise tax laws.  Join us as our newest member by filling out and sending in our <A HREF="/savers/member.html">Membership Form</A>. 

We hope the information provided will interest you and prompt you to want to know more and do more about this vital subject.  We stand ready to respond to your enquiries and comments.

<p>  
The Savers &amp; Investors League was organized in 1988 by <a   
href="/savers/library/tkbio.html">Tom Kelly</a> who recognized the compelling,   
critical need for increased personal savings and investment to foster healthy economic growth in the    
United States. <br>   
<p>   
Without question, private savings and investment is the  foundation for increased personal and national     
prosperity.  Whether these savings are in bank accounts, stocks, bonds, CDs, IRAs, insurance, annuities,    
pension funds, mutual funds, etc., they constitute the vital capital base needed and utilized by individuals,    
families, businesses, and government.<BR>   
<p>   
 On a personal level, insufficient savings creates uncertainty for future retirement, as well as uncertainty   
as to the family financial resources of home and health care needs and desires.  A diminished supply of    
private capital on a national scale causes interest rates to rise and economic growth to slow. Also,    
wages,jobs, and standards-of-living suffer.<br><br>   
 Disastrously, the government continues to pass or maintain self-defeating, senseless laws that   
limit and penalize tax-deferred savings plans such as IRA's, 401(k) s and pensions.<BR>   
<p>   
The annual income tax imposed upon investment return and   
realized gain needlessly and scandalously decreases  the country's   
vital capital base year after year. Not only do taxpayers suffer,   
the government's tax base is progressively reduced too.<BR>   
<P>   
The Nation must maximize personal savings and investment,   
so that private capital will grow and expand as quickly, and as   
soundly, as possible.<BR>   
<P>   
The Individual Investment Account, Senate Bill  
 <a href="/savers/legislation/s159.html">S. 159</a> and House Bill  
 <a href="/savers/legislation/hr328.html">H.R. 328</a>, accomplishes   
this simple but vital objective.<br>  
<p>  
The League helped develop this legislation and works diligently to secure its   
enactment.  The bipartisan sponsors are: Senator John Breaux</a>, Democrat,  
 Senate Finance Committee, and Representative Jim McCrery, Republican,  
 House Ways &amp; Means Committee.<br>  
<p>  
This simple, straight-forward legislation creates IRA-type accounts that provide -   
<br>  
<ul>  
<li>Unlimited, tax-deductible contributions for everyone<br><br>  
<li>No penalty taxes on any account withdrawal<br><br>  
<li>No forced distributions at any time<br><br>  
<li>No income tax nor estate tax at death<br><br>  
<li>Account holder, or beneficiary, only pay taxes on account withdrawals<br><br>  
</ul>  
<p>  
The Individual Investment Account Act has been described by leading tax economists   
as <i>&quot;one of the boldest, most imaginative, and most constructive pro-growth   
tax initiatives in many years.&quot;</i>

<TITLE>Tom Kelly Biography</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#2F4F2F" vlink="#3232CD">
<img src="/savers/images/tkellysm.gif"><FONT SIZE=5><B>&#32;Tom Kelly, President 
and Founder</B></FONT> <HR>
<P>
Tom Kelly, League President and Founder, likes to explain that he is not an actuary, accountant, lawyer or economist.  Instead, he describes himself as an &quot;entrepreneurial businessman&quot; within the pension and life insurance areas who has &quot;a 
facility for conceptualizing and implementing new solutions to old problems&quot;.<BR>
<P>
He began his career in 1948 as a pension and employee benefits consultant with Towers, Perrin, Forster, &amp; Crosby.  In 1962, Tom raised capital to underwrite the First Investment Annuity Company (FIAC).  The Investment Annuity, invented by Tom, was a 


policyowner self-directed variable annuity which had never been offered 
by any insurer previously.<BR> <P>
After fifteen years of product and financial success, the Treasury and 
IRS reversed over 70 favorable rulings issued over prior years to FIAC and other insurer emulators.  FIAC sued the Treasury and the IRS for &quot;arbitrary, capricious, and illegal 
acts&quot;.  The D.C. District Court agreed and stated that indeed the 
Treasury and IRS ruling was in fact arbitrary, capricious, illegal, and 
unreasonable.  Furthermore, the court stated that the IRS had usurped the 
power of Congress, and that deference to their 
expertise on this matter was unwarranted.  The Treasury and the IRS appealed.  The Appellate Court didn't look at 

the merits of the case but ruled that the District Court didn't have 
jurisdiction.  The District Court Judge had previously concluded 
that if FIAC couldn't be 
in District Court, FIAC was being denied due process of law - a 
constitutional matter...<BR> <P>
FIAC employed Robert Bork, Esq., then a Yale law professor and outstanding 
constitutional scholar, to assist in a Supreme Court petition.  For 
unspecified reasons, the 
Supreme Court did not accept the case.  Thus, the Treasury and IRS won - 
but not on the merits

 of their tax law position.  FIAC was thereupon forced to liquidate in 
1978.<BR> <P>
It was this encounter with arbitrary, capricious and illegal government 
acts that prompted Tom's strong interest and on-going great concern about 
the misguided 
driving force behind the government's tax policy in regard to saving.<BR>
<P>
That same year, 1978, Tom formed Insurer Central Services (ICS) that 
assists 
insurers enter the specialized field of variable annuities and variable life insurance.<BR>
<P>
The Savers &amp; Investors League was started in 1988 to educate and 
motivate grass roots voter/taxpayers to challenge and change the way our 
government measures the tax revenue impact of tax deferred savings.  
Towards this end, over the 
intervening years, Tom has worked with legislators, economists, and think tanks to develop legislation that meets the proper criteria for the sound taxation of personal saving.<BR>

<P>    
Because the League lobbies Congress on behalf of voter/taxpayers,
 it is a 501(c)(4) non profit corporation.     
Therefore, contributions to the League are not deductible as charitable contributions for Federal income     
tax purposes. However, contributions to the League may be deductible as an ordinary and necessary     
business expense, or an expense incurred in the production of income.<BR>    
<p> The League's affiliated Savers &amp; Investors Foundation carries out research endeavors that     
explore the impact of taxes on our economy, as well as on taxpayers, our government, and our nation. The     
Foundation is a 501(c)(3) research and educational nonprofit organization. 
Contributions to it are tax     deductible.    
<BR>    
<P>    
Neither the League nor the Foundation have a minimum or    
maximum contribution limit. All contributors choose the contribution    
amount most suitable for themselves.<b> While voluntary contributions    
from all sources are vital to the League's and Foundation's work,    
each voter/taxpayer's active participation via on-going communications    
with his or her Senators and Representative, regardless of contribution    
level, is what really counts. </b> Members of Congress respond to    
strong constituent interest. As a result of the League's activities, 
savers and investors become an increasingly powerful, focused force 
before Congress and the Administration.<BR>

<font size=6><b><i>Membership Information</i></b></font></center>
<hr>
<p><br>
The Savers &amp; Investors League is a nonpartisan, nonprofit 
501(c)(4) grass-roots lobbying organization.  Its purpose is to promote 
private saving and 
investment to foster healthy economic growth in the United States.  To
this end, the League develops sound legislative proposals, as well as
circulates information relating to existing and proposed legislation 
which it believes has either a positive or negative effect on saving 
and investing.  It intends to affect such legislation through grass
roots and direct lobbying efforts.<br>
<p>
The League is committed to action-oriented, legislative projects.
Every effort is made to distribute its views and proposals to Congress, 
the Administration, and other policy and opinion leaders nationally and 
locally to ensure that they are widely examined and discussed.  The 
League also disseminates its view via an active media and Internet 
program.<br>
<p>
Every voter/taxpayer (regardless of age or tax bracket) who saves and 
invests has a vital, personal interest in removing the severe income tax 
bias against saving and investing.  As we all know, Congress and the 
Administration pay close attention to public pressure.  Thus, <i>your</i>
 membership is most important because you join with many others to create 
and build the powerful political force so badly needed for success.<br>
<p>
While the Savers &amp; Investors League does not require any kind of annual 
fee to initiate or maintain membership, it does rely on 
voluntary contributions 
from individuals and corporations for its support.<br>
<p>
Because the League lobbies on your behalf, contributions paid to the League 
are not deductible 
as charitable contributions for Federal income tax purposes.  However, 
such contributions may be deductible as an ordinary and necessary 
business expense, or an expense incurred in the production of income to 
the extent permitted by law.<br>

<P>    
<center><b><i>All of your savings and investments should be tax deductible and tax    
deferred<br>   
until you, or your beneficiary, consume it.</i></b></center><br>   
<p>   
The Savers &amp; Investors League was organized in 1988 by <a    
href="/savers/about.html#tkelly">Tom Kelly</a> who recognized the compelling,    
critical need for increased personal savings and investment to foster healthy economic growth in the     
United States. <br>    
<p>    
Without question, private savings and investment is the  foundation for increased personal and national      
prosperity.  Whether these savings are in bank accounts, stocks, bonds, CDs, IRAs, insurance, annuities,     
pension funds, mutual funds, etc., they constitute the vital capital base needed and utilized by individuals,     
families, businesses, and government.<BR>    
<p>    
 On a personal level, insufficient savings creates uncertainty for future retirement, as well as uncertainty    
as to the family financial resources of home and health care needs and desires.  A diminished supply of     
private capital on a national scale causes interest rates to rise and economic growth to slow. Also,     
wages,jobs, and standards-of-living suffer.<br><br>    
 Disastrously, the government continues to pass or maintain self-defeating, senseless laws that    
limit and penalize tax-deferred savings plans such as IRA's, 401(k) s and pensions.<BR>    
<p>    
The annual income tax imposed upon investment return and    
realized gain needlessly and scandalously decreases  the country's    
vital capital base year after year. Not only do taxpayers suffer,    
the government's tax base is progressively reduced too.<BR>    
<P>    
The Nation must maximize personal savings and investment,    
so that private capital will grow and expand as quickly, and as    
soundly, as possible.<BR>    
<P>    
The Individual Investment Account, Senate Bill   
 <a href="/savers/legislation/s159.html">S. 159</a> and House Bill   
 <a href="/savers/legislation/hr328.html">H.R. 328</a>, accomplishes    
this simple but vital objective.<br>   
<p>   
The League helped develop this legislation and works diligently to secure its    
enactment.  The bipartisan sponsors are: Senator John Breaux</a>, Democrat,   
 Senate Finance Committee, and Representative Jim McCrery, Republican,   
 House Ways &amp; Means Committee.<br>   
<p>   
This simple, straight-forward legislation creates IRA-type accounts that provide -    
<br>   
<ul>   
<li>Unlimited, tax-deductible contributions for everyone<br><br>   
<li>No penalty taxes on any account withdrawal<br><br>   
<li>No forced distributions at any time<br><br>   
<li>No income tax nor estate tax at death<br><br>   
<li>Account holder, or beneficiary, only pay taxes on account withdrawals<br><br>   
</ul>   
<p>   
The Individual Investment Account Act has been described by leading tax economists    
as <i>&quot;one of the boldest, most imaginative, and most constructive pro-growth    
tax initiatives in many years.&quot;</i>   
<p>   
<hr>    
 <FONT size=5><b><a name="obj">Objectives</a></b></FONT><BR>    <hr>   
<P>    
<center><b><i>Your wealth is &quot;wealth&quot; no matter how small or large.<br>    
You must protect it from improper, confiscatory, taxes.</i></b></center><br>    
<p>    
The League's primary objective is to remove the government's senseless     
tax bias against private savings and investments. By building a broad base of voter/taxpayer activists,    
spanning all age groups and income     
levels, the League:<BR>     
<p>    
<ul>    
<li> Works toward the development and adoption of clear, concise, tax laws that    
 promote increased private saving and investing.<BR>    
<br>    
<li> Works with members of Congress and the Administration to support     
or defeat legislation which affects the taxation of private savings and     
investments.<BR>    
<br>    
<li> Communicates with voter/taxpayers, as well as with financial     
institutions, employers, unions, and the media.<br>     
<br>    
<li> Builds coalitions with like-minded groups, unions, and associations.<br>    
<BR>    
<li> Tracks and reports upon relevant legislation as it makes its     
way through the congressional maze.<BR>     
<br>    
<li> Informs the media on current savings and investment taxation issues in     
order to generate broad, public appreciation and understanding     
of this vital subject.<BR>    
</ul>    
<p>  
<hr>    
<FONT size=5><b><a name="sands">Structure and  
Support</a></b></FONT><BR>    <hr>   
   
<P>     
Because the League lobbies Congress on behalf of voter/taxpayers, 
 it is a 501(c)(4) non profit corporation.      
Therefore, contributions to the League are not deductible as charitable contributions for Federal income      
tax purposes. However, contributions to the League may be deductible as an ordinary and necessary      
business expense, or an expense incurred in the production of income.<BR>     
<p> The League's affiliated Savers &amp; Investors Foundation carries out research endeavors that      
explore the impact of taxes on our economy, as well as on taxpayers, our government, and our nation. The      
Foundation is a 501(c)(3) research and educational nonprofit organization.  
Contributions to it are tax     deductible.     
<BR>     
<P>     
Neither the League nor the Foundation have a minimum or     
maximum contribution limit. All contributors choose the contribution     
amount most suitable for themselves. <b>While voluntary contributions     
from all sources are vital to the League's and Foundation's work,     
each voter/taxpayer's active participation via on-going communications     
with his or her Senators and Representative, regardless of contribution     
level, is what really counts.</b>  Members of Congress respond to     
strong constituent interest. As a result of the League's activities,  
savers and investors become an increasingly powerful, focused force  
before Congress and the Administration.<BR>

<img src="/savers/images/tkellysm.gif"><FONT SIZE=5><B><a name="tkelly">&#32; Tom 
Kelly</a>, President and Founder</B></FONT> <HR> 
<P> 
Tom Kelly, League President and Founder, likes to explain that he is not an actuary, accountant, lawyer or 
economist.  Instead, he describes himself as an &quot;entrepreneurial businessman&quot; within the pension 
and life insurance areas who has &quot;a  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
facility for conceptualizing and implementing new solutions to old problems&quot;.<BR> 
<P> 
He began his career in 1948 as a pension and employee benefits consultant with Towers, Perrin, Forster, 
&amp; Crosby.  In 1962, Tom raised capital to underwrite the First Investment Annuity Company (FIAC).  
The Investment Annuity, invented by Tom, was a  
 
 
policyowner self-directed variable annuity which had never been offered  
by any insurer previously.<BR> <P> 
After fifteen years of product and financial success, the Treasury and  
IRS reversed over 70 favorable rulings issued over prior years to FIAC and other insurer emulators.  FIAC 
sued the Treasury and the IRS for &quot;arbitrary, capricious, and illegal  
acts&quot;.  The D.C. District Court agreed and stated that indeed the  
Treasury and IRS ruling was in fact arbitrary, capricious, illegal, and  
unreasonable.  Furthermore, the court stated that the IRS had usurped the  
power of Congress, and that deference to their  
expertise on this matter was unwarranted.  The Treasury and the IRS appealed.  The Appellate Court didn't 
look at  
 
the merits of the case but ruled that the District Court didn't have  
jurisdiction.  The District Court Judge had previously concluded  
that if FIAC couldn't be  
in District Court, FIAC was being denied due process of law - a  
constitutional matter...<BR> <P> 
FIAC employed Robert Bork, Esq., then a Yale law professor and outstanding  
constitutional scholar, to assist in a Supreme Court petition.  For  
unspecified reasons, the  
Supreme Court did not accept the case.  Thus, the Treasury and IRS won -  
but not on the merits 
 
 of their tax law position.  FIAC was thereupon forced to liquidate in  
1978.<BR> <P> 
It was this encounter with arbitrary, capricious and illegal government  
acts that prompted Tom's strong interest and on-going great concern about  
the misguided  
driving force behind the government's tax policy in regard to saving.<BR> 
<P> 
That same year, 1978, Tom formed Insurer Central Services (ICS) that  
assists  
insurers enter the specialized field of variable annuities and variable life insurance.<BR> 
<P> 
The Savers &amp; Investors League was started in 1988 to educate and  
motivate grass roots voter/taxpayers to challenge and change the way our  
government measures the tax revenue impact of tax deferred savings.   
Towards this end, over the  
intervening years, Tom has worked with legislators, economists, and think tanks to develop legislation that 
meets the proper criteria for the sound taxation of personal saving.<BR>

<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
<hr>
</center>
<P>
<blockquote>
<br>
<p>
The current tax code -- with its high marginal tax rates and thousands of pages of rules, 
regulations, and red tape -- poses a formidable barrier to economic growth. 
<p>
<ul>
<li>It punishes the most dynamic forces for growth in our economy -- the small business owners 
and entrepreneurs who turn bold ideas into new businesses, new jobs, and new products.
<p> 
<li>It discourages working Americans who are trying to save for the future to build a better life 
for themselves and their families.
 <p>
<li>It is endlessly complex and confusing, costing literally billions of dollars in lost time and 
effort.
</ul>
<p>
Tax reform must move toward making the tax code more family friendly and create incentives 
for savings and investment.    
<p>
The congressional leadership has <a href="/taxcom/dole.html">asked</a> the National Commission on Economic Growth and 
Tax Reform to start with a blank piece of paper and design a system that is flatter, fairer, and 
simpler -- one that will encourage strong economic growth and greater opportunity for all.
<p>
The commission will gather the views of American citizens from all walks of life and will 
gather the best  available analysis and evidence from the experts who study and analyze tax 
policy.  The commission is expected to issue its recommendations and its report in December.  
<p>
The commissions report should provide recommendations that will contribute to 
reinvigorating entrepreneurship, risk-taking, savings, investment, and work efforts.  Its goal is 
to produce a report that will make America more competitive and expand the nations 
worldwide leadership in the twenty-first century global economy.

It outlined a plan by the DNC and the Clinton administration to improve ties to the Asian community - while at the same time raising millions of dollars from its members.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>"Mrs. Matsui has indicated that she was not involved in the development of the campaign plan," Mr. Davis said. "More importantly, Mrs. Matsui has not engaged in any solicitation of contributions or any other improper fund-raising activities."<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>It is illegal for government employees to solicit political contributions.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The unprecedented goal of raising the $7 million in funds was laid out in a "National Asian Pacific American Campaign Plan," which was part of 3,000 pages of the DNC's records made public over the last two weeks.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The recently released records, mostly from the files of Mr. Huang, the DNC's chief fund-raiser among Asian-Americans, raise questions about whether White House officials illegally participated in fund-raising and campaign activities.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>In addition, the party's goal of raising the money may have helped create a high-pressure atmosphere that led to at least $1.2 million subsequently being returned to contributors as improper donations.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Under the plan's guidelines, invitations to the White House were extended to members of the Asian Pacific American Leadership Council, or to individuals giving at least $10,000 and companies at least $15,000 to the Democratic committee.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The strategy was to "reward APALC members by inviting them to special White House or other events" with the president and to "solicit input," the records show.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mr. Davis said Mrs. Matsui, wife of Rep. Robert T. Matsui, California Democrat, headed the Asian Pacific American Working Group while Mr. Huang was involved with the Asian Pacific American Leadership Council, a group of DNC-related contributors.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>A senior White House official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said Mrs. Matsui does not recall having read the campaign plan. The official also said the document's author, DNC official William Kaneko, has told administration officials he is not certain whether the 33-page document was even forwarded to Mrs. Matsui's office.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>No evidence suggests that donors won changes in policy, even though White House meetings often featured discussions of Mr. Clinton's policies toward Asian nations, especially China.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>But in the past month, two connections between Clinton administration policy and the Lippo Group, an Asian company that paid Mr. Huang a $780,000 bonus just before he moved to the Commerce Department, have come under question.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Earlier last month, the president acknowledged that he received a letter in 1993 from Mochtar Riady - founder of the Indonesia-based conglomerate that donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Clinton campaign - seeking normalization of trade relations with Vietnam at a time when the company was moving its $6.9 billion real estate and investment empire into that country.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mr. Clinton denied the letter influenced his decision to end a 30-year trade embargo on Vietnam, which he did in 1994.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Late last month, the Associated Press reported a connection between Lippo and Mr. Clinton's designation of 1.7 million acres of Utah wilderness - known as the Kaiparowits - as a national monument.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>A U.S. mining company owned by a British family was ready to tap a huge reserve of environment-friendly coal there but was forced to reverse course with Mr. Clinton's announcement in September. Lippo has business interests related to coal: One of its subsidiaries was involved in a now dormant joint venture to run a clean-coal-fueled power plant in China.</TD></TR></TABLE> <TD ALIGN=Left VALIGN=Top COLSPAN=1 ROWSPAN=1><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH=9><TR ALIGN=Left VALIGN=Top> <TD ALIGN=left VALIGN=Top COLSPAN="1" ROWSPAN="1"><IMG SRC="../images/vertical.gif" WIDTH=9 HEIGHT=60 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" border=0></TD></TR></TABLE> <TD ALIGN=Left VALIGN=Top COLSPAN=1 ROWSPAN=1><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH=180><TR ALIGN=Left VALIGN=Top><TD ALIGN=Left VALIGN=Top COLSPAN=1 ROWSPAN=1><A HREF="mailto:wtadvt@wt.infi.net"><IMG SRC="../ads/house_ad.180.gif" WIDTH=180 HEIGHT=60 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="TWT House Ad 1" border=0></A></TD></TD></TABLE></TD></TD></TABLE><center><p><a href="#linkTOP">Go back to the top of this article.</A></center></TD></TR>

It is the most sinister car going."<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Portrayed in images ranging from German Albrecht Durer's 15th-century woodcuts to anti-nuclear art of the 1960s, the specter of a coming millennium has fascinated Western civilization.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The last two decades have reflected a rising American anxiety about the future, depicted in films such as "Road Warrior," "Escape From New York," "Escape From L.A." and "Blade Runner." Their story lines, set in bleak 21st century cities turned into police states or terrorized by gangs, do not show a Second Coming as much as they show a hell on Earth.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The modern art world has dipped its collective toe slowly into visions of the morass. In "New Visions of the Apocalyptic," a 1988 exhibition at the Rhode Island School of Design, 19 artists displayed works on the defoliant Agent Orange and scenes from literal hells with titles such as "Figures With Bleeding Eyes."<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The one hopeful piece in the exhibit was artist Ruth Kligman's "Apocalyptic Art," an abstract rendering of color and light inspired by Revelation 22:5, which promises night will be vanquished forever and the redeemed "will not need the light of a lamp or the light of the sun, for the Lord God will give them light. And they will reign for ever and ever."<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The other depictions were secular ruins: the atom bomb, the Nazi Holocaust and ecological decay, as the plant world dies first when the world's end is imminent. Other scenes came from a world in which morality has faded, replaced by random, escalating violence from a new urban predator class of youths.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Although Mr. Scott, 46, does not call himself a Christian -- "I've been too disappointed" -- he acknowledges that "the symbolic structure of the West is based on biblical imagery. The symbols in Christianity are powerful despite popular disinterest in it as a religion."<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Equipped with a nail, Mr. Scott, a part-time instructor at the Ontario College of Art in Toronto, scratched all 22 chapters from Revelation into every inch of a Trans Am primed with black latex paint. Now displayed in an airy rotunda at the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the Trans Am has dice hanging from a rearview mirror and a license plate reading "Ex-Nihil 666."<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The dice refer to Albert Einstein's insistence of order in the universe and that "God does not play dice." The number 666 is the biblical number of the satanic beast someday to rule the world. "Ex nihil" is close to the Latin "ex nihilo," meaning "out of nothing."<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>A video next to the car blasts rock music and shows rock musicians and riot scenes juxtaposed, with Mr. Scott laboriously carving verses, a Bible open before him.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>"The apocalypse is the perfect postmodern state," he says. "All history is present simultaneously." But apart from Georgia primitive artist Howard Finster, "people seem to be ignoring the date more than I thought they would. I can't think of anyone doing contemporary art because they are worrying about the world coming to an end."<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mr. Scott likens his work to Survival Research Laboratories, an avant-garde trio of nihilistic artists based in San Francisco. In the 1980s, SRL fused themes of heavy metal, stock car races, dead animals, warfare and male sexuality to create bombastic performances of what High Performance magazine termed "orgies of destruction." To the sound of explosions, shattering glass and gasoline motors, radio-controlled car-sized machines ripped into one other, spitting streams of liquid and spewing fumes.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>"Heavy-metal youth cultures are obsessed with death," Mr. Scott says. "The car symbolizes destructive masculine egos, environmental destruction, the follies of us all that lead to the end."<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Not that all death imagery is bad. Gospel singer Pat Boone, shortly to release an album, "Pat Boone in a Metal Mood," claims heavy metal is filled with biblical images.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>In an interview in the November issue of Charisma magazine, he says the heavy metal group Megadeath reminds him of the ominous prophecies of Old Testament prophet Jeremiah and the Apostle John, writer of the Book of Revelation.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>"Many of the writers [of heavy metal] have come out of a religious background, who have seen the dark side of life, [and] now do have a tremendous sense of foreboding and of the ominous," he told the magazine.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mr. Scott says, "The Book of Revelation, probably more than any other text, has informed Western consciousness. All heavy metal albums make reference to it, the beast, 666, all that stuff. A lot of heavy metal is anarchic, and there's a longing for an apocalypse where all order will be reversed."<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The recent hit movie "Independence Day" is a subtle hint of the End, Mr. Scott says, as "those ships, like the hand of God, sweep across the screen and then time ends." But it doesn't really. American know-how rescues the world once again -- a shame, the artist says. "People wanted the end to happen."<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The artist's confrontation with death gets personal, as Mr. Scott suffers from a degenerative bone disease that caused his body to shrink by 8 inches in one year.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>"I'm in constant pain," he says, "because I'm always breaking things. The vertebrae in your spine collapse and the cartilage compresses. All your organs are squished. Where it gets problematic is breathing.

"This apocalyptic mood is current in the art field because of the problems the art community has with AIDS."<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Nevertheless, Mr. Scott's melancholy art, which ranges from drawings of bunnies to skeletons, shows a "complete lack of self-pity," according to a recent review in the Toronto Globe and Mail. The passer-by may miss the artist's inner struggles, the reviewer wrote, but will surely see the artist's "inner work of reconciliation with death."<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mr. Scott's Trans Am was a hit nearly two years ago during a 1995 reception at the National Gallery hosted by President Clinton for Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>"Bill Clinton loved it, an American product in the National Gallery of Canada." the artist said.

"I'm really surprised, to say the least. Personally, I'm opposed to anything that links homosexuality with age, gender and ethnic origin. Personally, I feel homosexuality is a sin, just like cheating on your wife. I'm not going to sign it."<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Another worker said the code could prevent him from opposing a homosexual pastor at his local church or speaking out against same-sex "marriage."<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The discrimination statement is part of a five-page code of conduct signed in November by Kenneth J. Hunter, chief of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The discrimination clause states:<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>"Employees acting in an official capacity will not directly or indirectly authorize, permit or participate in discrimination based on age, gender, ethnic origin, physical or mental disability or sexual orientation against anyone, whether or not they are employees. Because we are a law enforcement agency, off-duty conduct that demonstrates an inability to be fair, objective and unbiased in dealings with others will not be tolerated."<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The statement does not include the word "religion," which is commonly protected in federal non-discrimination policies.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mr. Hunter was unavailable for comment. No other member of his service was willing to discuss the code on the record.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>A spokesman read this statement: "The policy will only affect any action that is a violation of the law. For example, if someone refused rental to a homosexual and that was in violation of a local law, then that would be dealt with if that came to the inspection service's attention. Public objections to a homosexual teaching one's child --that's free speech. We're not violating anybody's free speech."<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Leonard Hirsch, president of Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Employees of the Federal Government (GLOBE), said all Cabinet-level departments except the Pentagon now have rules barring discrimination based on sexual orientation.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mr. Hirsch said none of those policies extends to an employee's off-duty hours, unlike the postal agency's code. But he said because the Postal Inspection Service involves law enforcement personnel, it is appropriate to regulate after-hours conduct.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>"These policies are developed to protect people's liberties, not to take them away," he said. "As long as they do their job well, honestly and effectively without discrimination, there will be no problem."<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>"Law enforcement is different because of the public trust that is mandated for employees of law enforcement agencies," Mr. Hirsch said. "It is not unheard of to have a higher standard of behavior."<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>FBI Director Louis J. Freeh in November issued a new policy outlawing discrimination against employees based on sexual orientation. The FBI has refused to release the policy, calling it an "internal document."<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>But a source said the memo did not contain off-duty language similar to the Postal Inspection Service's code.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Homosexuality is not protected by federal civil rights laws.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Robert Maginnis, an analyst at the Family Research Council, said the Postal Service policy will mean new forms of intolerance.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>"People who have deeply held moral beliefs, they need not apply for the federal jobs," Mr. Maginnis said.

When it was a boomtown, building sites "popped up" all over town.

William Cohen, about these very issues during his upcoming confirmation hearing.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Specifically, LOGM has demanded that Mr. Cohen be asked pointedly for his views on the ongoing controversy between the executive branch and Congress over compliance with the Ballistic Missile Defense Act and the Defense Appropriations Act. For over a year, the administration has steadfastly refused to comply with the timetables and programmatic guidelines set forth in those statutes for development and deployment of two theater missile defense systems, the Army's THAAD and the Navy's Upper Tier system.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>This violation of federal law led this past year to congressional hearings on the matter and the filing of a federal lawsuit against President Clinton and Defense Secretary William Perry by 41 members of Congress to force the president to discharge his duty under Article II, Section 3 of the United States Constitution to "take care that the laws of the United States be faithfully executed."<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>As lawyers, we are outraged by the Clinton administration's cavalier disregard for federal laws mandating the development and deployment of theater missile defenses. As citizens we believe that the United States Senate and the American people deserve to hear from Mr. Cohen whether he intends to comply with those laws or whether he intends to perpetuate his predecessor's legacy of stonewalling and delay on this important issue.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Only after a full airing of Mr. Cohen's views on this disturbing situation (and what he would do to rectify it) can the Senate and the American people make a final decision on Mr. Cohen's fitness for the office of secretary of defense.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=0>Anthony J.

The fact remains that the best results come from individuals being responsible for themselves and leaving the market to  be controlled by their preferences; 3) Ms. Claybrook simply does not trust American consumers to make judgments about their purchases. The lives of some buyers' children have relevance in her logic system only to the extent that they were "studied" and that government actions comported to the recommendations of such studies.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Her claim that she "had no control over auto manufacturers that chose to develop the cheapest, rather than the best, air bags" is outrageous. Would Ms. Claybrook be more smug and self-satisfied if the public complaint involved the high cost of "the best air bags" instead of kids' lives?<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The greatest danger to our republic (and the lives of all of our kids) is that the likes of Ms. Claybrook have been allowed to coercively impose their expertly informed judgments in the marketplace and that we mere consumers were denied the prerogative to "simply say no."<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=0>Albert B.

<title>President's Message</title>
</head>

<body background="/yaf/ground2.gif">


<img alt="Picutre of Reagan and Robinson" src="r&r.gif" align = ><br><h2>President's Message</h2>

You would be very disappointed if you knew what was going on in our schools.<p>

America's public schools and colleges have relinquished their role of defending and transmitting our history, religious heritage, and culture.<p>

Schools are hotbeds of violence, disrespect and failure.<p>

School administrators pass out condoms and teach "tolerance" for deviant lifestyles, but insist they can't "impose" religious values or even ask students to say the Pledge of Allegiance.<p>

Students learn the latest environmental theories but they aren't taught to adequately read, write, or add. <p>

College admissions programs and faculty hirings are rigged. It's better to be designated a member of an "oppressed" class than to be an honor student or an effective teacher.<p>

Our heroes are demeaned. Long-standing American role models are replaced with obscure but "politically correct" characters in a new "multicultural" curriculum.<p>

Thomas Sowell notes that every one of Karl Marx's works is available in our schools' bookstores. But Sowell no longer finds The Federalist Papers.<p>

The Bible is taboo; it's replaced in our grade schools with Heather Has Two Mommies!<p>

The Radical Left decided that its most important goal was to gain control of our educational system.<p>

Radical teachers and administrators promote an agenda that attacks traditional values, causes racial strife, and is preoccupied with envy and class warfare.<p>

Radical feminists institutionalize an anti-family agenda through "Women's Studies" departments and programs.<p>

Militant homosexuals design freshmen orientation programs to force acceptance of their lifestyles and consequently demand a ban on religiously oriented free speech.<p>

Leftist control is so complete that students on many campuses are denied the right to attend ROTC or they are told they cannot form religious clubs.<p>

At the University of Maryland students weren't permitted to display the American flag during the Persian Gulf war!<p>

In 1992 Bill Clinton spoke at fifty campuses, appeared on youth-related television programs, and otherwise targeted the student audience.<p>

President Clinton frequently dispatches his Administration's officials to the college campus, especially Hillary Clinton, Joycelyn Elders, Al Gore, and Robert Reich.<p>


College administrators who have a sordid history of violating students' Constitutional rights, as Donna Shalala did at the University of Wisconsin and Sheldon Hackney at the University of Pennsylvania, are given choice governmental positions.<p>

Our educational system, in which we invest our fortunes and our children, are controlled by people who are hostile to the values we hold dear.<p>

Most of us know there is a problem but we are tempted to underestimate how bad or how damaging it is. <p>

Abraham Lincoln expressed it best, "The philosophy of the school room in one generation will be the philosophy of government in the next."<p>

If that holds true, we are in for some very, very hard times.<p>

Can it be more obvious?<p>

Conservatives need to be more active in the education of our nation's young people.<p>

We must demand that our schools be balanced and fair institutions.<p>

That is the mission of Young America's Foundation.<p>

Unfortunately, those who control our schools are not about to voluntarily share power.<p>

In fact, one lesson conservatives have learned is that the Left covets a monopoly over information and education in America.<p>

Young America's Foundation's twenty-five year record is a history of struggle to break the Left's monopoly in our schools.<p>

Leading scholars and policy makers who lecture for the Foundation have made a dramatic impact. Recent nationwide tours by William F. Buckley, Jr., Dinesh D'Souza, Bay Buchanan, Edwin Meese, Bill Bennett, Walter Williams, and Oliver North have been large enough and effective enough to change our campuses for good.<p>

Young America's Foundation has benefited by the involvement and help of Ronald Reagan, Milton Friedman, Phyllis Schlafly, Patrick Buchanan, Dana Rohrabacher, Caspar Weinberger, Robert Dornan, Jeane Kirkpatrick, Jack Kemp, Phil Gramm, and Robert Novak.<p>
	
But it is the students, faculty members and financial supporters are the real heroes of Young America's Foundation's first twenty-five years.<p>

Students invest tremendous time and energy to put on our programs, publish independent papers and journals, and fight faculty and administration pressure to conform to a "politically correct" agenda. Often these young men and women make great personal sacrifices to participate in our activities.<p>

Conservative faculty members are a rare group indeed. Yet those who have dedicated their careers to truly educating their students merit our eternal gratitude. Many deserve mention but I am especially thankful for the help given by Burt Folsom, Forrest McDonald, Richard Ebeling, Walter Williams, Thomas DiLorenzo, Alan Sabrosky, Charles Kesler, Jeffrey Hart, the late Russell Kirk and M.E. Bradford.<p>

Financial supporters have made these programs possible. You have backed up these students and faculty members with the financial support their schools should have provided but didn't.  They have helped create a successful model to inform students of the greatness of our country, its free enterprise heritage, and our many blessings from God.<p>

Each of us must do more to achieve our goal of passing on a heritage of which we can be proud. But it is appropriate to take a short time to reflect on how far we have come. Thank you.<p><p>

<i>	College students, don't despair!  Though the job market is tight, Young America's Foundation can give you a leg up on your competition.  Through our jobs program, Job Prospects for College Graduates, you will know what employers are looking for.  Bring a corporate leader to your school who will tell you what you need to do in college to get a good job when you graduate.  And he will tell you about the realities of the job market.  In addition, a free market economist will tell you about the benefits of the free market system. . . a perspective you won't find often on campuses!<p>
</i>
	College students are wise to be particularly concerned this year about finding a job after graduation.  Studies show that as of graduation day, only 40 percent of the class of 1995 had found a job appropriate for their degree.  That number goes up only to 50 percent by November.  To make matters worse, studies show that employers are losing faith in the ability of colleges to prepare students for the workforce.  They are looking more at the experience of a potential employee rather than their academic record.<p>

	What is the reason for these phenomena?  There are two explanations.  First, the quality of our colleges and universities are eroding.  Except at a few select schools which have maintained their commitment to academic instruction, multicultural and politically correct courses supplant classes with practical value for future employment.  And second, the Clinton Administration's regulatory policies are forcing businesses to forgo expansion.  When employers must hire, they opt for trained, experienced individuals, rather than taking a chance on a new graduate.  Government regulations make the expense and hassle of bringing on even an experienced worker prohibitive.  Why, then, would an employer opt to hire someone fresh out of college, with no experience, and very likely in need of remedial education, in addition to basic job training?<p>

	Do not despair!  Young America's Foundation has a program which will help students maximize their college degree so that employers will snatch them up, or at least give them a chance.  In addition, students will learn the real reasons why it is so tough to get a job for which befits their degree.<p>

<i>	Job Prospects for College Graduates</i> is a program designed to promote an accurate understanding of our free market system of economics.  We seek to dispel the widespread myth, promoted by leftist professors, that "big business" is responsible for the difficulty recent college graduates encounter when they attempt to enter the work force.  Specifically, we are examining the impact of burdensome federal regulations and of the federal government itself in constraining the job market.  In addition, we are focusing on the devaluation of today's college degree given the politicized curricula, and the consequent skepticism of employers of higher education's ability to prepare students for the workplace.<p>

	During the fall of 1995, Young America's Foundation will cosponsor a series of<i> Job Prospects for College Graduates</i> programs on campuses.  At each program, a free market economist and a corporate leader will speak to students giving them the insights they need to maximize their educational opportunities and avoid the pitfalls of a politically correct degree.  In addition, students will gain a unique understanding of their job opportunities and of the qualities employers are seeking in new recruits.<p>

	Young America's Foundation is publishing a monograph written by Dr. Thomas J. DiLorenzo for the Foundation entitled,<i> Job Prospects for College Graduates:  The Role of Government and The Responsibilities of the University.</i>  The monograph will be available to all students.<p>
